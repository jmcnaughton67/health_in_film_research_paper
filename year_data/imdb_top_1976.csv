Rocky,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-time Philadelphia boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the world heavyweight champion in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect. Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer failing to make it big time. Despite his true talent and his inability to admit defeat, his friends and his coach, Micky, never give him the time of day. When Apollo Creed, the Heavyweight Champion of the World visits Rocky's home town asking for a lesser man to fight, Apollo chooses him based on his nickname, 'The Italian Stallion'. With his shot at glory in front of him, Rocky trains harder than he thought was possible in order to earn his own self-respect and go the distance.—nalimradek Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer from working-class Philadelphia, is arbitrarily chosen to take on the reigning world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, when the undefeated fighter's scheduled opponent is injured. While training with feisty former bantamweight contender Mickey Goldmill, Rocky tentatively begins a relationship with Adrian, the wallflower sister of his meat-packer pal Paulie.—Jwelch5742 It's late 1975. Thirty year old Rocky Balboa, nicknamed the Italian Stallion, is a third rate club heavyweight boxer in his home neighborhood of working class South Philadelphia. Needing to supplement his income to live, he also works as the enforcer for loan shark Tony Gazzo, but being a sensitive soul underneath that tough boxing exterior, Rocky is unable or unwilling literally or proverbially to break a few fingers of Gazzo's clients if they miss payments, which doesn't sit well with Gazzo. This work is also partly the reason why the club's trainer, Mickey Goldmill, has never paid Rocky too much attention in feeling he being a wasted talent. Rocky is also lonely, he attracted to his gruff best friend Paulie Pennino's extremely shy sister, Adrian Pennino, Rocky often frequenting the pet store where she works just to talk to her. Rocky's life has the potential to change when he is approached by the management of undefeated world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed for what he believes is Apollo needing a sparring partner in the lead up to his American bicentennial world heavyweight boxing match in Philadelphia on New Year's Day in five weeks time. Instead, they, along with a $150,000 appearance fee, offer Rocky the world championship bout against Creed in Creed's original opponent bowing out due to injury. What Rocky doesn't know in ultimately accepting the offer is that they chose him not even knowing him as a boxer, they, unable to find a ranked opponent at such short notice, solely wanting a persona to epitomize the American dream for this bicentennial bout. Ultimately supported by among others Paulie, Mickey, and especially Adrian, Rocky has to fight through his own insecurities to come to a place of entering the bout on his own terms.—Huggo Philadelphia Pennsylvania, home to the number one underdog fighter, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stalone). The date is November 25, 1975, Rocky is fighting Spider Rico in a prize fight at a local church arena. The fight goes smooth through the first couple of rounds. Before beginning the next round, Rocky and Spider get up from their corners after receiving advice from their corner-men and the fight continues. After a couple of punches, Spider grabs a hold of Rocky and headbutts him in the face. The crowd goes restless on Spider. Rocky, after recovering from the hit, goes after Spider and finishes him off. The bell rings signaling the end of the fight and Rocky is pronounced the winner. Rocky and Spider both leave the ring and head back to the locker room. One woman loser in the arena audience shouts at Rocky ""you're a bum!"" as he leaves the ring. In the locker room, Rocky and Spider get their prize money for the fight in which Spider Rico gets $17.80 after taxes and gym expenses, Rocky's winning prize is $40.50 after taxes and expenses. Rocky approaches and finds Spider lying on a bed where he tells Rocky that he was ""lucky"".Rocky walks home in the cold seedy night through the trash-strewn streets of Frankford Avenue in the crime-ridden Kensington neighborhood after the fight and arrives home to a small one-room apartment on a side street to feed his pet turtles, Cuff and Link. He grabs a can of the turtle food and recites himself a line regarding the item into the mirror. He then looks at a picture of himself from his youth and then grabs some ice from the freezer and puts it on the cut that Spider gave him and lies down on his bed.The next morning, Rocky visits the local pet shop where Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) works and talks about the turtle food that he bought. Adrian, being shy and quiet, doesn't respond to Rocky even after he tells her a joke about the food. Her boss (Jane Maria Robbins) commands her to clean out the cat cages and she walks away not paying attention to Rocky.Rocky is walking down at the docks with a stick in his hand whistling, and out to collect money for his boss Gazzo, a local loan shark. He finds a man riding a forklift and when the man sees Rocky, he drives away. Rocky chases him on foot when the man runs from the forklift and Rocky catches up to him demanding Gazzo's money totaling $200 or he'll have to break one of the guy's thumbs. He tells Rocky that he doesn't have enough money but offers him his coat and around $130. Rocky takes the money, but refuses to punish the deadbeat guy and instead gives him a warning.A little later, Tony Gazzo (Joe Spinell) and his driver/bodyguard Buddy (Joe Sorbello), pick up Rocky on a bridge near the docks and Rocky tells him about the man and gives Gazzo what money the deadbeat had on him. Gazzo gives Rocky $20 for his collection assignment and tells him about more collection jobs in the coming days for Gazzo's other clients. The thug, Buddy, lets out a comment about Rocky's face as he and Gazzo get out of the car to talk in private. On the street, the calm but still angry Gazzo asks Rocky why he didn't break the man's thumb like he asked and Rocky tries to defend himself but Gazzo doesn't believe him. Gazzo sternly reprimands Rocky to do what he tells him to do from now on because it is bad for Gazzo's reputation in the neighborhood. Gazzo leaves Rocky by the side of the road and gets back in his car. Buddy further insults Rocky by calling him a ""meat-bag"" before driving away and Rocky angrily shouts: ""I shoulda broke YOUR thumbs!.""Later that day, Rocky goes to Mickey's Gym only to find out that his locker has been rented out to new-comer Dipper Brown, and that his stuff is now hanging on a hook on ""Skid-Row"". Mike the janitor tells Rocky about it and tells him where Mickey is. Rocky sees Mick (Burgess Meredith), a 76-year-old elderly and temperamental former lightweight boxer, now a trainer, working with Dipper. Rocky goes to ask about the locker and Mick admits that Dipper is an up-and-comer and Rocky is nothing. Echoing what the woman heckler told Rocky the previous night, Mickey calls Rocky a ""bum"". Angry and dejected, Rocky leaves the gym.Rocky goes back to see Adrian at the pet store which is about to close for the night. Rocky asks her if she wants to go to see a basketball game, but she refuses the invitation. He then asks to walk her home and she again turns him down. He warns her about the people walking the streets at night and suggests that she take a taxi home.Rocky then goes to the Lucky 7 Tavern for a beer or two where he sees his best friend and Adrian's older brother, Paulie (Burt Young), cursing up a storm in the restroom after the mirror has been broken. Rocky tells him about Adrian and he shouts at Rocky that she's a loser and can't take care of herself. Paulie asks Rocky if he would like to take Adrian out on a date since she seldom leaves their house, and Rocky agrees. Paulie takes his beer and leaves. Rocky remains sitting at the bar drinking his own beer and watches TV and sees that the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is on TV. Rocky and the bartender talk about him until Rocky leaves.On his way home, Rocky notices a group of teenage kids standing on the corner drinking and smoking cigarettes and sees that one of them is Marie (Jodi Letizia), an underage teen girl he knows. He pulls her out of the group and walks her home. On the way, he tells her about respect and the kind of people that she should be hanging out with. After reaching her house, she calls Rocky ""Creepo"" and he heads back home.The next day in New York City, Apollo Creed and his trainer Tony are meeting with Miles Jergens (Thayer David), a fight promoter, discussing the possible fighters for him to match in the biggest fighting event set to take place on New Year's Day. When it looks like there are no possible fighters, Apollo has a epiphany: he'll take on a small time underdog fighter, giving him a shot at the title. Everyone agrees with the idea and the plan is set in motion.Meanwhile, Rocky is dropped off at his house by Gazzo and Buddy after his latest collection job, and they talk about Adrian. Rocky wonders how they knew about him and Adrian. Gazzo mildly replies: ""I hear things"". Buddy further insults Rocky by calling Adrian a retard and how retards like the zoo and Rocky attempts to lunge at him, but Gazzo separates them. He gives Rocky $50 for his date with Adrian. Before leaving, Buddy tells Rocky to take Adrian to the zoo and speeds off.At Apollo's office, he and Tony are looking through a book of local club fighters of Philadelphia and they come across Rocky who seems to be the perfect fighter. Apollo takes a liking to his nickname, ""The Italian Stallion.""That same evening, on the night of Thanksgiving, Rocky and Paulie are walking home and Paulie keeps imploring Rocky to get him a job with Gazzo as a collector, because he hates his current job at a meat packing factory. They reach Paulie's house where Adrian is making Thanksgiving dinner. She comes out of the kitchen to greet Paulie but doesn't realize Rocky is with him. Rocky says 'hello' and she walks back into the kitchen. Paulie goes to talk to her and she runs into her bedroom embarrassed. Paulie gets her out and tells to go out with Rocky for the night, but Adrian claims that it's Thanksgiving and she's cooking a turkey. Paulie goes to the kitchen and grabs the turkey out of the oven and throws it out the back door. Adriana begins to cry and Paulie yells at her to go out. Rocky tells him to forget the date but Paulie instructs him to go talk to her. Rocky walks over to her door and talks to her through the door but doesn't get any feedback. He asks her if she wants to go out with him and have a good time and she opens the door all dressed up ready to go.On Paulie's advice, Rocky and Adrian head for the local ice rink. They look around and see that it's empty and the maintenance man (George Memmoli) tells them that the rink is closed for the night. Rocky bribes him $10 and they have the rink for themselves for 10 minutes. Adrian's skating as Rocky is running along side her telling her about the fights he's been in and how it's special to him.After their date, Rocky and Adrian go back to his apartment where she is hesitant about going inside. Rocky implores her that its okay and she follows behind him. Inside his apartment, Adrian feels uncomfortable admitting that she's never been in a man's apartment before. Rocky admits he doesn't feel comfortable neither and he's kind of nervous too. She wants to leave but Rocky stops her, trying to cheer her up giving her compliments. He tells her that she wants to kiss her and he does and the two end up kissing in his corner by the door.The next day, Rocky heads for Mickey's Gym and Mick tells him that Jergens' office called, possibly asking for sparring partners. Rocky says the same thing to himself and a frustrated Mick yells at him. Rocky asks why after all this time Mick's been giving him the cold shoulder, but Mick refuses to reply. Rocky demands to know and Mick yells at him across the gym that Rocky had the talent and the heart to be a great fighter but instead became a ""leg-breaker"" for the local loan shark and bookie Tony Gazzo. Rocky defends his occupation and that it's a living, but Mick retorts that it's a waste of life and he again calls Rocky ""a bum"".Rocky goes to see Jergens and tells him that he is willing to help out with the sparring training with Creed and tells him that he'd give it his all. Jergens then offers Rocky a proposition into fighting with Creed on on New Year's Day, however, Rocky declines. Jergens tells Rocky that it was him that Creed chose to fight and that its a once in a lifetime shot to win the heavyweight boxing title. Rocky takes a minute to consider it.Back at Paulie's house, Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie watch a TV interview with Apollo and Rocky about the upcoming fight and they see that Apollo's been taunting Rocky through the whole session. Paulie tells Rocky that he should break his legs and that he should be able to win the fight. Rocky says that the taunts don't bother him. Adrian tells Paulie has a good chance of winning. Paulie gets up and storms out of the room cursing loudly. Rocky gets ready to leave and Adrian follows him outside. Before leaving, Rocky admits to Adrian that the stuff said on TV actually hurt him inside.The following evening, Rocky meets with Gazzo outside Pat's Steakhouse grill where they get some steak sandwiches to eat and to talk about Rocky being chosen to fight Apollo. Gazzo gives Rocky $500 for training expenses and wishes him the best.A few hours later, Mick, having heard about Rocky's shot at the title goes to see Rocky at his apartment and he begins telling him about his old days as a featherweight fighter during the 1930s and all the injuries he endured. He tells Rocky that he wants to become a manager for him. Rocky tells him that he asked for help years ago but Mick turned him down. A defeated Mick gets ready to leave as Rocky is sitting in his bathroom. After Mick leaves, Rocky starts shouting to Mick about his asking to help him. Mick is half-way up the street and Rocky runs up to him and apologizes to him.Early the next morning, Rocky gets up at 4:00 a.m. and prepares for a morning run. He drinks a half-dozen raw eggs. Rocky starts his run through the Philly streets and at the end, attempts to run up the stairs of the Philadelphia Art Museum but can't reach it all the way because he's out of shape and out of breath.Later, Rocky goes to see Paulie at the meat processing plant where he works. They talk about Adrian, with Paulie, speaking derogatorily, asks if Rocky is sleeping with his sister. Rocky becomes annoyed to the point where he admits the truth about why he can't talk to Gazzo about giving Paulie a job working for him: Paulie talks too much. Rocky says he's ready to leave because of the cold and the smell of the meat factory, a frustrated Paulie begins hitting a huge side of beef hanging from the ceiling, taunting Rocky. Rocky steps over and beings throwing punches into the meat, breaking the ribs. Paulie jokes at Rocky saying if he did that to Apollo Creed he'd be put in jail for murder. Rocky takes the meat that Paulie's prepared him for the week and leaves.At Paulie's apartment, Adrian cares to Rocky's cut up hands from hitting the meat. She begins to get intimate with him but he keeps backing her off, telling her that there's no ""foolin' around"" during training. Adrian near upset gets up and goes to the kitchen, Rocky gets up and follows her and apologizes and they embrace.Rocky begins training with Mick and Mike the janitor at the gym. Two girls walk in and ask for Rocky's autograph, Mick dismisses them harshly and tells Rock that ""women weaken legs"" and to lay off ""the pet shop dame"": Adrian. Rocky tells him that he really likes her, and Mick shouts back at Rocky telling him to let her train him for women are a distraction to his training. Rocky takes a second and agrees with Mick and will not fool around anymore.A few days later, Rocky is jogging back to his apartment building where Adrian is waiting on the steps with a surprise for him. She has purchased and given Rocky Butkus, the big Bulldog Mastiff from the pet shop. Rocky begins jogging around with Butkus days later. One day, Rocky and Butkus run to Paulie's workplace to find a TV news van in the back. Rocky finds Paulie and he tells Rocky that he needs publicity but Rocky, now mad, wanted privacy. Rocky and Paulie go inside and meet with the news reporter and they ask Rocky for a demonstration on how he trains with the meat. He begins to jab at the meat as the news camera looks onto him. Tony, Apollo's trainer, is watching the interview and sees that Rocky means business.On Christmas Eve, Paulie is walking home, clearly drunk. Rocky and Adrian are already there watching a Christmas movie on TV. They start talking about Paulie about what he did with the publicity stint back at the slaughterhouse. A drunken Paulie, overhearing the conversation, enters the room and threatens the both of them to leave his house. When they refuse to leave, Paulie grabs a baseball bat and threatens Rocky that he'll break both his arms. He begins swinging at a lamp and then breaks the end table next to Rocky and Adrian. Paulie begins ranting that he never done anything wrong to Rocky and he even let him go out with his sister. Paulie then admits the truth about why he hates Adrian so much and then begins smashing more things with the bat. Paulie shouts at Adrian that she owes him, but Adrian yells back saying that it is she who takes care of Paulie. Another insulting remark by Paulie about Adrian sends her running to her room crying. Rocky angrily grabs Paulie ready to punch him, but he quickly realizes that Paulie is too drunk and weak. Rocky lets go of Paulie and walks into Adrian's room to comfort her. She asks Rocky if he'd like a roommate and that she is moving out of Paulie's house.A couple of days later, Rocky is at the gym training again with Mick and Mike. After the session, Mick introduces Rocky to their cut-man Al Silvani. Rocky gets out of the ring as Mick and Al talk, and he begins hitting a heavy bag. Paulie walks in and offers Rocky an advertising job for him.

Rocky stands in the center of the ring and looks around to see that the place is well decorated and ready for the fight. Jergens shows up and Rocky tells him how the stripes on his shorts are wrong in the giant painting of him but Jergens dismisses it, saying he believes Rocky is going to give the world an incredible show. Rocky goes back home as Adrian slowly awakes as Rocky lays down on the bed upset. He tells her that he won't be able to beat Apollo and how no one has ever gone the distance with him before.New Years Day, 1976. On the night of the fight, Rocky and Apollo are both getting prepared. When Rocky gets the cue that it's time, he leaves Adrian down at the locker room as she wishes him good luck. Rocky starts making his way towards the ring as some of the crowd cheers for him.

She writes for Rolling Stone and other magazines. She says she would do anything to get an exclusive interview... with Esther! When Esther arrives soon after, she finds them in bed together. Quentin begins to interview Esther nonchalantly, as thought it's no big deal that Esther has caught her in bed with John. Esther is in shock and remains motionless and speechless. John tells Quentin to get the hell out, and she does so in anger, on the way telling Esther nothing really happened because John couldn't get an erection.Esther leaves the bedroom and smashes some vases and all the bottles of alcohol of John. She slaps him but John doesn't defend himself. She tells him he is not going to destroy her life like he has destroyed his own.In spite of her anger, Esther finds she still loves John and can't leave him. They go to their small home out west in the middle of nowhere.One day, John goes alone to the airport to pick someone up and bring them back. He takes his flashy sports car, puts on some of Esther's songs and purposefully drives recklessly and much too fast, ignoring the traffic signs on the road.A helicopter in the middle of nowhere. The red sports car has had an accident. John is dead. Esther runs to him but it's useless. Esther asks for a blanket. She cries in silence. She wonders what she would do without him. He is taken away in an ambulance.Back at that huge mansion John had bought, Esther is alone, staring at the wall, still struggling to accept that John is dead. She runs downstairs when she hears John's voice. John is calling out, demanding someone else answer the phone. A mover comes from another part of the house asking if she knows how to turn off the tape recorder that's playing that old song writing session John's taped, during which the phone had started ringing.The next shot is of John's funeral procession going slowly down the freeway. The DJ who wouldn't accept John's apology, is heard on the radio saying that John was one of his closest friends and that John was one of the greats.At Esther's next concert, as she steps up to the microphone and the lights are dimmed, the entire audience quietly raises candles as tribute to her lost husband. Touched, Esther softly begins singing one of John's trademark songs that his group performed early in the film, but as a ballad rather than a rock song. It gradually leads into more powerful singing, all of it focusing on their love, the impact he had on her life and the effect on her of his loss."
All the President's Men,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074119/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"""The Washington Post"" reportersBob WoodwardandCarl Bernsteinuncover the details of the Watergate scandal that leads to PresidentRichard Nixon's resignation. In the run-up to the 1972 elections, Washington Post reporterBob Woodwardcovers what seems to be a minor break-in at the Democratic Party National headquarters. He is surprised to find top lawyers already on the defense case, and the discovery of names and addresses of White House fund organizers on the accused further arouses his suspicions. The editor of the Post is prepared to run with the story and assigns Woodward andCarl Bernsteinto it. They find the trail leading higher and higher in the White House.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Factual account of investigative journalistsBob WoodwardandCarl Bernsteinof the Washington Post whose reporting of the Watergate break-in eventually led to the resignation ofRichard Nixon, 37th President of the United States. The film focuses on the period from the break-in on June 17, 1972 to Nixon's re-election in November later than year. Their perseverance - and the support of their editors - revealed that the break-in at the Watergate office complex was only one small part of a much larger network of intelligence gathering activities, many of which were illegal. The story also focuses on the role of Woodward's now legendary secret source dubbed Deep Throat (since identified as FBI Deputy DirectorMark Felt) and the encouragement he provided when the journalists hit roadblocks in their investigation.—garykmcd On June 17, 1972, the Washington DC police apprehend five men who broke into the National Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate building. The Washington Post newspaper assignsBob Woodward, a reporter relatively new to the paper who works the local news desk, to cover the seemingly minor story. When Woodward sees that the five men - primarily Cuban immigrants - have high powered lawyers working for them in the background, he sees a potentially larger story. That's when a fellow reporter at the newspaper,Carl Bernstein, who is more of a hack who was close to being fired, wants in on the story as well, which Woodward eventually welcomes. One of Woodward's Washington insider contacts, who is given the code name Deep Throat, implies that the break-in is indeed part of a larger story. Deep Throat will neither confirm or deny information, but will lead Woodward in the right direction if Woodward does get confirmation of information. Deep Throat eventually tells him to ""follow the money"", which leads them to uncover that the burglars had moneys in their bank accounts that were originally donated to the Committee to Reelect PresidentRichard Nixon. They have to uncover who controlled the diversion of those funds to see how high up the story goes, which may lead them into the White House itself. Through the process, they have the obstacles of the newspaper's editor-in-chiefBen Bradleewho needs their story to be confirmed by reliable source after reliable source to prevent liable, few sources tied to the Committee who will speak to them on the record (their silence which is as telling to Woodward and Bernstein as actual information), and public apathy as no one but them, their newspaper and those to who they speak seem to believe there is a story at all. As they get closer to the truth, there may be those who will do anything to quash the story, all in the name of national security.—Huggo Two green reporters and rivals working for the Washington Post,Bob WoodwardandCarl Bernstein, research the botched 1972 burglary of the Democratic Party Headquarters at the Watergate apartment complex. With the help of a mysterious source, code-named Deep Throat, the two reporters make a connection between the burglars and a White House staffer. Despite dire warnings about their safety, the duo follows the money all the way to the top.—Jwelch5742 In June 1972, a smiling, confident President Nixon is about to address the American people. At the Watergate building in Washington, D. C., flashlight beams are visible through the windows of an office. Security guard Frank Wills discovers a piece of masking tape covering a door latch in the garage, and calls the police to report a possible burglary. Inside an office, one of the burglars announces through a walkie-talkie, ""We're home."" On the receiving end is a man watching from an adjacent window, who warns them of ""activity."" Three undercover police enter the building and arrest the burglars.The next morning, Harry Rosenfeld (Jack Warden) and Howard Simons (Martin Balsam), editors at the Washington Post, briefly discuss the burglary, including the large amounts of cash, 35mm cameras and walkie-talkies found in the burglars' possession, and the fact that they invaded the Democratic Party's national headquarters. Reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) asks to cover the story, but it is given to Bob Woodward (Robert Redford).Woodward attends the burglars' arraignment and is surprised to learn that they have private council. The burglars, James W. McCord, Bernard Barker and three others, have a Mr. Starkey as their private attorney, even though they hadn't contacted anyone since the arrest.Back at the office, Woodward, Rosenfeld and Bernstein discuss the information they've gathered: McCord had worked for the CIA, though the CIA denies knowledge of him. That night, a policeman calls Woodward concerning some entries found in the address books of two of the burglars, which include the names ""Howard Hunt"" and ""WHouse."" Woodward calls the White House the next morning and asks for Hunt; he is referred to the office of Charles Colson, special council to the President. When he finally reaches Hunt, Woodward's questions are greeted with shock and evasiveness.Woodward continues his investigation, and is ultimately given an unsolicited denial of Colson's involvement in the Watergate burglary from the White House. Simons, realizing that the story is of national interest, believes it should be covered by a top political writer, rather than an inexperienced youngster. Rosenfeld disagrees, and partners Bernstein with Woodward. Bernstein begins his research by interviewing Karen, a former employee of Colson's. She describes both Colson and Hunt as very secretive, but she learned that Hunt was investigating Senator Edward Kennedy on behalf of the White House, doing extensive research at the White House library.At the news room, Bernstein contacts the librarian, who corroborates Karen's story, then suddenly denies any knowledge of Hunt. Woodward calls Deputy Director of Communications Ken Clawson at the White House, who denies that the librarian spoke to Bernstein. The reporters take their investigation to the Library of Congress but find nothing. The resulting news story is lacking in hard evidence, and Executive Editor Ben Bradlee keeps it off the front page.From a phone booth, Woodward calls an anonymous man, who refuses to discuss Watergate. The next morning, Woodward finds a note from the man in his copy of 'The New York Times' instructing him to contact him by placing a small red flag from a flower pot at the balcony of his apartment building. That night at 2:00 am, Woodward takes a series of taxis to an underground parking garage, where the anonymous man (Hal Holbrook) is waiting. Woodward promises the man that his identity will remain secret, then recounts the details of the investigation. The man advises Woodward to ""follow the money.""A few days later, The New York Times uncovers evidence of the Watergate conspiracy dating back to March 1972. Bernstein travels to Miami, Florida, where State Attorney Dardis has subpoenaed Bernard Barker's telephone and money records. Dardis's file contains several checks from a Mexican bank, and one from a Florida Bank issued to Kenneth H. Dahlberg for $25,000.Woodward contacts Dahlberg, an officer with the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP), who gave the check to CREEP finance chairman Maurice Stans, who in turn gave it to Barker. At a meeting of Washington Post editors, feelings are mixed about continuing the Watergate investigation, with Rosenfeld as the strongest advocate. One editor admits that he simply does not find the story believable.At their next conference, Woodward and Bernstein inform Bradlee and Simons that the General Accounting Office (GAO) has discovered a secret fund containing hundreds of thousands of dollars among CREEP's accounts. Woodward's anonymous source, now referred to as ""Deep Throat,"" points to the money as the key to the investigation. Bradlee is losing faith in the story, but Woodward and Bernstein are undaunted.
They acquire a list of CREEP employees and attempt to interview several in their homes. One woman tells them to leave before they are seen, and is in tears as she closes the door.The reporters continue to visit CREEP employees, but virtually all refuse to talk; Woodward and Bernstein suspect an organized cover-up. After two weeks, they still have no solid evidence. Rosenthal further discourages them with the news that the GAO report will not be released until after Nixon is re-nominated for president, and only Hunt, the five burglars, and CREEP operative G. Gordon Liddy will be indicted for the Watergate burglary. Bernstein continues his efforts to interview CREEP employees, using any excuse to get inside their houses. One woman, a CREEP bookkeeper, admits that she had long been aware of the secret fund and mentions a list of 15 names with a dollar amount next to each. The list was destroyed, however. She refuses to disclose the names of the men who control the secret fund but she will identify initials.As Woodward and Bernstein transform the bookkeeper's comments into a story, they discover that former Attorney General and CREEP chairman John Mitchell controlled the secret fund, along with Liddy, Bart Porter, Jeb Magruder, attorney to the President Herbert Kalmbach, and one other. When the reporters visit the bookkeeper again, she indicates that they are being watched.Woodward and Bernstein next visit Hugh Sloan, who recently resigned as CREEP treasurer as an act of conscience. Sloan states that all CREEP activities are approved by the White House, and estimates the amount of the secret fund at close to $1 million. The two reporters describe John Mitchell's criminal activities to Bradlee, Rosenfeld and Simons; Bradlee is aggravated by the fact that none of the sources can be named, but still approves the story. Bernstein calls Mitchell at home to read him the story, in case he'd like to comment on it. Mitchell responds with vulgarity and threats, and issues a statement the next day denouncing the story, without pointedly denying it.Bernstein travels to Los Angeles to interview Donald Segretti, a young lawyer who, under the supervision of CREEP operative Dwight Chapin, sabotaged the campaigns of several Democratic presidential candidates. Back in Washington that night, Woodward meets again with Deep Throat, who explains that the Department of Justice was well aware of the infiltration and sabotage of the Democrats. As Woodward leaves the underground garage, he suspects that he's being followed and starts to run, though no one is behind him.Woodward learns from an FBI source that Segretti was paid from the CREEP secret fund by Chapin, who was hired by White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, suggesting that Haldeman is the fifth man who controls the fund. Woodward and Bernstein visit Sloan for confirmation of Haldeman's involvement, but rather than confirming the story, Sloan says he has ""no problem"" with it. Bernstein calls his source at the FBI, who confirms that ""John Haldeman"" controlled the fund. Woodward is not convinced, nor is Bradlee, but Bernstein gets further confirmation from a contact at the Justice Department and Bradlee runs the story. The following morning, Sloan denies implicating Haldeman, and the Nixon administration publicly denounces the Washington Post. The paper is barraged with criticism, and Bradlee is angered by his reporters' blunder, but he stands by the story.At Woodward's next meeting with Deep Throat, he learns that Haldeman runs the entire operation, Mitchell has the entire U. S. intelligence community involved in his covert operations, and the cover-up exists mainly to protect these covert operations. He is also told that he and Bernstein are under surveillance and their lives are in danger. Woodward heads to Bernstein's apartment and shares this new information via typewriter to keep their conversation from being heard. They wake up Bradlee at his home and disclose what they've learned from Deep Throat. Bradlee states that, even though half of all Americans have no interest in the Watergate affair, the future of the nation may be riding on it.In the final scene, Woodward and Bernstein are soon back at their typewriters, relentlessly working on the story as Nixon is sworn in for his second term on January 20, 1973. Sometime later, the Washington Post teletype reports the convictions and sentences of the conspirators, and Nixon's resignation from office on August 9, 1974."
King Kong,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074751/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A petroleum exploration expedition comes to an isolated island and encounters a colossal giant gorilla. When a research ship is sent to explore an island thought to be rich in oil, paleontologist Jack Prescott sneaks aboard, having heard strange rumors about the island. En route, the crew rescues Dwan, the sole survivor of a shipwreck. When they arrive, they find native people living in fear of a monster called Kong. The natives kidnap Dwan and sacrifice her to what turns out to be an enormous ape. Dwan is eventually rescued, and the ape captured for a gala exhibit.—Jwelch5742 In this remake of the 1933 classic about the giant ape, an oil company expedition disturbs the peace of Kong and brings him back to New York to exploit him. Even though a woman somewhat tames Kong, he finally breaks loose and terrorizes the city, and as the military attempt to stop him, he falls to his death from the top of the World Trade Center.—yusufpiskin An expedition of the ""Petrox"" company, is exploring in search of petrol. A strange island where they arrive is the home of a giant ape, King Kong, that is captured by the expedition in order to make money exhibiting it to the world. When in the U.S. the huge gorilla becomes restless, trying to return home...—<lcarvach@lascar.puc.cl> The owner of the oil company Petrox Corporation, Fred Wilson, invests all his possessions searching oil in an unexplored island. The vessel leaves Surubaya, in Indonesia, with the stowaway Jack Prescott, who wants to protect an ape called Kong. While traveling, they find the castaway Dwan in the middle of nowhere in a rescue boat in the ocean and bring her on board. The group finds that the island is inhabited and the local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong. They abduct Dwan to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. The crew hikes into the jungle trying to rescue Dwan. King Kong falls in love with Dwan and protects her against a huge serpent. When Fred finds that the oil in the island is not ready for exploitation, he decides to capture Kong and bring him to New York for exhibition. In the middle of a show, King Kong escapes, bringing panic to the locals.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, Roy Bagley, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jack Prescott, a primate paleontologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jack also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be ""wed"" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jack is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials. While they lead him away on the main deck, Jack spots a life raft floating some distance away. When the raft is salvaged, they find a beautiful blond woman unconscious, but alive. She's brought a aboard and revived by Jack. She identifies herself as ""Dwan"" and tells everyone that she'd been a guest aboard a yacht that sank after a fire that had occurred during the storm they'd sailed through the day before (the captain remembers that they'd received a faint distress call during the storm). Dwan had been on the deck because the party's host had wanted to show the movie Deep Throat & she refused to stay in the viewing room.Dwan quickly wins the hearts of the crew. Jack is allowed to join the voyage as a photographer. The ship arrives at the fog bank and a landing craft is launched with Jack and Dwan accompanying the party. After sailing for a bit in the fog bank, it lifts and the mysterious island is visible. They land on a beach and begin to trek inland. They stop at a huge wall, built of giant timbers and chinked with mud. Wilson believes the wall was left behind by an ancient civilization but Jack points out that repairs consisting of mud have been done recently. He's also certain that the wall was built to protect the village from something dangerous lurking on the other side. The party hears drumming in the distance and finds a small village at the edge of the wall where the island's human inhabitants are in the midst of a ritual. One of the tribe's women is being dressed in ceremonial garb while a priest wearing a carved gorilla mask dances in front of her. Wilson speculates that the man in the mask will be the groom, however Jack suggests that the real groom is beyond the wall's huge gate the village is centered around. Bagley spots a small pool of black fluid in the village and tells Fred that it could be oil.Suddenly the priest spots the landing party and halts the ceremony. He walks straight to the party and shouts angrily, quite plainly furious that their ritual has been witnessed by strangers. When he spots Dwan, he demands they trade her for six women from his village. When Jack refuses the offer, the natives advance and Jack orders the men to fire their guns in the air to scare them off.The party returns to the ship and makes plans to return to the island, pacify the locals and start their tests of the oil they spotted. Jack is highly critical, pointing out that Petrox is essentially invading the sovereign territory of an independent and primitive tribe and that the natives were shouting a strange word, ""kong"" during the ritual, insisting that there's more to the wall and the ritual that could endanger the lives of everyone. Wilson and his staff ignore Jack and he leaves. On deck, he gathers supplies and plans to steal a landing boat to return to the island and explore himself. Dwan finds him and talks him out of going -- she has a bad feeling that Jack will be harmed. She and Jack plan to meet in her state room and spend the night together. Jack agrees and leaves briefly. While Dwan waits for him, she's suddenly grabbed by a small gang of locals from the island and taken swiftly away in an canoe. Jack returns & finds a necklace that could have only belonged to one of the locals. He tells Wilson, who rallies his crew to go to the island and find Dwan.On the island, the natives are preparing Dwan for the ceremony. She's dressed in their traditional garb and given a small amount of fluid from a seashell -- presumably a drug to calm her. She's taken to a sacrificial altar on the other side of the wall's giant gate and tied by the arms to two posts. The natives run back through the gate and close the bolt. They gather at the top of the wall, waving torches and beating ceremonial drums. Suddenly, their celebration is halted. From deep in the forest they hear the cracking of falling trees. As the noise becomes closer, a massive beast crashes out of the forest. Dwan looks up to see a giant ape standing in front of her, scrutinizing her carefully. Kong looks Dwan over, roars his approval and gently picks her up. He turns and walks back into the forest.Jack, Wilson and the rest of the rescue party arrive in the village, firing flares to scare the natives away. They open the bolt and cautiously wander outside. Wilson stumbles into a large hole that everyone recognizes as an ape's footprint. Jack gathers several men and they begin following Kong's trail into the forest. Wilson stays behind to organize operations on the other side of the wall.Pursuing Kong along his tracks and the trail of broken trees, the team pauses occasionally to plant seismic markers for Wilson. Though the workers don't feel the need to rush, they begin to quicken their work when Jack suggests Kong is headed their way. The team comes to a deep ravine, bridged by a downed tree. Jack makes his way across, showing the rest that it's safe. As the team crosses, Kong suddenly appears on Jack's side. Jack slides down the ravine wall on a vine while Kong seizes the end of the tree trunk and begins to tilt the crew off -- all of them except for one man, Boan, plummet to their deaths. Kong spends a short time trying to grab Jack who has hidden in a small crevice. Kong gives up and strolls off. Jack yells for Boan to make it back to the village and tell Wilson he's going to continue his pursuit of Kong.Back on the beach, Bagley returns to tell Wilson the test results he'd gotten from a sample of the oil. Though it is pure crude, it hasn't gone through enough of the natural process to make it a grade suitable for refining. Wilson is crushed, having already radioed Petrox that he was going to be bringing in a huge find. However, another idea strikes him and he calls for a cargo air drop.At the wall Wilson preps for Kong's return: he's brought a bulldozer ashore and along with several dozen barrels. He has his crew dig a deep hole near the gate and lays electrical cable. While he watches from the top of the wall, he spots Boan. When he asks his man where the rest of his crew is, Boan only answers by making a slashing gesture across his throat.In the forest, Kong continues his trek, grasping Dwan. He stops at a large clearing and puts Dwan down, sitting back and watching her eagerly. She tries to crawl away a few times but Kong stops her with a simple gesture. When she tries to run, he roars and stops her again, pounding the ground near her when she falls into a mud patch. He picks her up again and stalks off. At a giant waterfall, she holds her under the curtain to clean off the mud. Later, Kong arrives at a mountain bluff where he begins to curiously pick at Dwan's clothing. At one point, Dwan becomes angry, pounding on the ape's nose. Just then, a giant rattlesnake slithers out of the brush and attacks Kong. Kong wrestles with the snake, which quickly coils itself around him. As he struggles, Jack finds Dwan and they run off. Kong is enraged and kills the snake by ripping it's jaws open. He takes off after Dwan and Jack.Dwan and Jack are able to stay just ahead of Kong -- they leap from a tall cliff, landing in a river. Kong chases the exhausted pair back to the wall where Wilson's men quickly open & close the gate for them. Wilson orders the bolt drawn back halfway to allow Kong the chance to enter. Kong smashes the wall open, stumbles through the wrecked gate and falls directly into the camouflaged hole Wilson's crew prepared. Wilson uses an explosive device to dump hundreds of gallons of chloroform into the pit. Kong thrashes for a bit and then falls unconscious. The natives fall to their knees in front of the pit.A few days later, a large Petrox tanker is sailing on the ocean. Kong is housed in one of the giant tanks. Wilson tells Jack and Dwan that they're both being given lucrative entertainment contracts. A tour of the USA featuring Kong as Petrox' new mascot is being readied. Dwan accepts immediately but Jack is scornful, calling it a grotesque farce. Eventually he gives in. That night, while Jack and Dwan kiss on the bridge, Dwan's scarf slips from her neck and drifts down into Kong's holding cell. When he smells Dwan's scent, he flies into a rage and begins beating the sides of his tank, waking the crew. Dwan goes to the grating on the top of the tank and tries to calm the beast when the captain threatens to flood the tank with sea water. He leaps up to try and catch Dwan -- he misses and the impact rocks the ship, causing Dwan to fall. Kong catches her safely and puts her on the floor. She then climbs out.The Kong tour begins at Shea Stadium. Jack visits Dwan and Wilson before the show, saying he's abandoning his contract and donating the money he earned to a fund that will send Kong back to his island. At the show, Jack watches the gaudy and grandiose pageant where Dwan is lashed to a platform similar to the one on the island and Kong is brought out, caged, shackled and wearing a horrid crown. When the media moves in to take a statement from Dwan, Kong believes she's being threatened and almost effortlessly breaks his shackles and rips apart his cage. He begins a rampage that destroys part of the stadium and crushes several people under his feet, including Wilson himself. He spots Jack taking Dwan out of the parking lot in his car but they're forced to run when the fleeing crowd is too thick. Kong breaks out of the stadium and follows them through the city. Believing he's spotted Dwan on an el-train, he smashes it open, tossing aside the screaming woman when he sees it isn't her.Jack and Dwan make it to Manhattan and find it mostly deserted. Dwan wants Jack to buy her a drink at an abandoned bar. Jack is more concerned with Kong finding them, but Dwan reminds her that apes don't like water and he can't possibly make it across the East River to Manhattan. Jack suddenly remembers that the World Trade Center towers look very much like two rock spires in Kong's mountaintop hideout on his home island. He calls the military &, after gaining their word that they'll try to capture Kong rather than kill him, tells them that they should let Kong climb the World Trade Center towers. The military agrees. Meanwhile, Kong, in seeming defiance of Jeff's theory, wades across the East River and onto Manhattan when he sees that the nearest bridge is being watched by the Army.Moments later, Dwan is captured by Kong when he finds them in the bar. He stomps away toward the WTC, being given a clear path by the military. When he arrives there, he climbs one of the towers with Dwan clutching his shoulder. When he reaches the top, he's suddenly set upon by men wielding flame throwers. Kong leaps from his tower to the other. He rips up various rooftop objects and hurls them at the men, finally finding a gas tank that explodes, killing both men. Jack is helpless to aide Dwan, watching from the observation deck on the other tower.Kong and Dwan hear helicopters in the distance. The choppers close in and are ready to open fire, waiting for Kong to release Dwan. Though she pleads with Kong to hang on to her for his own safety, he gently brushes her away and the Hueys open fire. Despite being able to knock two of the choppers out of the sky, he is still gravely injured by the gunfire. He grows weak and falls prone on the roof. Dwan approaches him and reaches out to touch him when he rolls over & falls off the tower, crashing into the plaza below. On the ground, Dwan approaches the ape and listens as his heartbeat slows and stops. She's immediately surrounded by a mob of reporters and government officials. Sadly, she calls out Jack's name, however Jack does nothing."

The group steals off with the contraband, running over DiGeorgio's partner in the process. Harry and his colleague Lt. Bressler (Harry Guardino) rush to the hospital, where DiGeorgio reports with his dying words that the attacker was a pimp that he and Harry questioned in an unsolved murder years earlier.Back at the police station, Capt. McKay receives a cassette tape from Maxwell's group, which identifies itself as the 'People's Revolutionary Strike Force' and threatens to blow up buildings around the city unless they are paid $1 million. McKay, who believes the Strike Force is composed of black militants, reinstates Harry to the homicide division to work the case. Harry notes that Miki, who was found dead at the crime scene, was a known prostitute, and argues that the killer is a pimp, as DiGeorgio reported. Harry is chagrined to discover that his new partner is Kate Moore, the young woman he interrogated at the inspector interview.When Harry and Kate attend a LAW rocket demonstration, Harry pulls the naive Kate away from the launcher's backfire, saving her life. The inspectors then visit the coroner's office to learn that DiGeorgio's murderer used killing techniques indicative of Special Forces servicemen in the Vietnam War. As Kate grows squeamish and runs outside, a bomb detonates in the building's bathroom, prompting Harry and Kate to chase a Strike Force operative named Henry Lee Caldwell (Tim Burris), whom Harry vaguely recognized on his way inside. During the pursuit, Caldwell drops his briefcase in a dumpster, but Kate retrieves it as Harry follows the militant across apartment rooftops. Caldwell falls through a skylight, lands on the set of a pornographic film and gets away until Harry detains him at a church.Sometime later, Harry delivers the dynamite that was stashed in Caldwell's briefcase to Lt. Bressler, who reports that the ""suspect"" is a member of the black militant group Uhuru, lead by Big Ed Mustapha (Alpert Popwell). Harry and Kate visit Mustapha's headquarters, where Kate fends off aggressive men while Harry learns that Caldwell left Uhuru to ""go white,"" joining the criminal organization of a fellow Vietnam veteran. Noticing that Mustapha's office is filled with stolen artifacts, Harry threatens to bust the radical leader for robbery unless he provides information about Caldwell's organization. Mustapha negotiates for the prison release of an Uhuru member, then reviews Harry's list of names which includes all of the pimps that he and DiGeorgio once interviewed; Mustapha identifies Bobby Maxwell as Caldwell's new leader. After Harry and Kate leave, Capt. McKay, Lt. Bressler and a SWAT team surround Mustapha's building and load Uhuru members into a paddy wagon.Later, McKay strategies with the mayor to credit Harry and Kate to for the Uhuru arrests, noting that the commendation of a female inspector will impress the electorate. When Harry realizes that Uhuru is being blamed for Hamilton Firearms Co. theft, as well as the ensuing threat of violence and the blackmail, which has now been increased to $2 million, he refuses to participate in the publicity stunt. As Harry states his case to the mayor (John Crawford), McKay suspends him and Kate runs after her partner, offering support. Harry lets down his guard, reporting that Maxwell, their primary suspect, will be impossible to find without Mustapha, and Kate suggests they post Mustapha's bail.Sometime later, Maxwell's Strike Force kidnaps the mayor after a San Francisco Giants baseball game by ambushing his limousine and raising the China Basin Bridge so he cannot escape. That evening, Maxwell's girl friend and second in command, Wanda (Samantha Doane), telephones a local radio station to announce the Strike Force's demands, leaving a cassette tape in the phone booth. After listening to the tape, which sets a $5 million ransom for the mayor, Capt. McKay and Lt. Bressler find Harry in a pool hall and demand cooperation, but Harry refuses their plan to negotiate with the terrorists.Harry later meets with Mustapha, who identifies the Strike Force and leads him to Wanda, who works as a masseuse. At the massage parlor, which fronts as a brothel, Harry learns that Wanda has left her job to become involved with a church, lead by Father John (M.G. Kelly). Kate later briefs Harry about the militant, radical priest, who gave rehabilitation seminars at San Quentin State Prison while Maxwell was an inmate.At John's church, Harry bullies the priest for information as Wanda, dressed as a nun, aims her gun from behind; however, Kate appears in the pews and shoots Wanda dead, saving her partner's life. Distressed by the violence, Father John tells the detectives that the mayor is being held hostage at Alcatraz.The inspectors take a boat to the abandoned prison island and a gunfight ensues. After finding the mayor and shooting his captor, Kate shields the politician from Maxwell and his henchmen. As she reunites with Harry, she warns her partner that Maxwell is aiming from behind and is caught in the crossfire, herself. As Kate dies, she urges Harry to carry on without her. Although Maxwell resumes control of the mayor and leads him up an observation tower, Harry pursues them from a distance with a LAW rocket. As Maxwell leaves the mayor on a lower floor to look for Harry from the top, Harry launches the rocket and kills Maxwell. Disinterested in the pompus mayor's promise of commendation, Harry stands over Kate's body as Capt. McKay arrives by helicopter. Unaware that the standoff has ended, McKay announces to Maxwell that he is delivering the Strike Force's $5 million ransom."
The Bad News Bears,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074174/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aging, down-on-his-luck ex-minor leaguer coaches a team of misfits in an ultra-competitive California little league. Former minor leaguer Morris Buttermaker is a lazy, beer swilling swimming pool cleaner who takes money to coach the Bears, a bunch of disheveled misfits who have virtually no baseball talent. Realizing his dilemma, Coach Buttermaker brings aboard girl pitching ace Amanda Whurlizer, the daughter of a former girlfriend, and Kelly Leak, a motorcycle punk who happens to be the best player around. Brimming with confidence, the Bears look to sweep into the championship game and avenge an earlier loss to their nemesis, the Yankees.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> Perpetually semi-inebriated, the beer-drinking, cigar-smoking, one-time minor-league pitcher turned professional pool-cleaner, Morris Buttermaker, agrees to coach San Fernando Valley's hopeless little league baseball team, the Bears. To scrape up some cash, Coach Buttermaker has to show this band of maladroit oddballs the ropes--to have, at least, a fighting chance in the upcoming championship--going as far as to recruit the streetwise twelve-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends and first-rate pitcher, Amanda, and the tough juvenile delinquent, Kelly Leak. Will the group of misfits start winning games? Do they stand a chance against the nearly perfect team, the Yankees?—Nick Riganas Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau), an alcoholic and former minor-league baseball player, is recruited by a city councilman and attorney who filed a lawsuit against an ultra-competitive Southern California Little League which excluded the least skilled athletes (including his son) from playing. In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players in the whole Little League. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foul-mouthed shortstop with a Napoleon complex, an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol Hank Aaron, and a motley collection of other ""talent"". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, with the score at 26 to 0 before Buttermaker forfeits the game.Realizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: First up, is sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlizer (Tatum O'Neal), a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 12-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing ""on the sly"". Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining. Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, ""Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?"" Amanda responds by asking, ""Who's he?"" Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the ""best athlete in the area,"" who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley). With Whurlizer and Leak on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games.Eventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner (Vic Morrow). As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Turner engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose.The turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Turner's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey (Brandon Cruz) and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg (Gary Lee Cavagnaro). Turner orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild beanball nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Turner goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run. Joey then leaves the game dropping the ball at his father's feet.Buttermaker - realizing that he has become as competitive as Turner - puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment.Having narrowly lost the game at 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears (in a sarcastic tone implying that they really not mean it) telling them that although they are still not that good, they have ""guts."" Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell ""Wait 'til next year!"", then they spray their beers all over each other. The movie ends with a field celebration by the Bears that makes it look as if they won the game."
Silent Movie,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075222/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A film director and his strange friends struggle to produce the first major silent feature film in forty years. Aspiring filmmakers Mel Funn, Marty Eggs and Dom Bell go to a financially troubled studio with an idea for a silent movie. In an effort to make the movie more marketable, they attempt to recruit a number of big name stars to appear, while the studio's creditors attempt to thwart them. The film contains only one word of dialogue, spoken by an unlikely source.—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> The film is set in Hollywood, in present day Los Angeles and is a silent film. Mel Funn (Mel Brooks), a great film director, is now recovering from a drinking problem and down on his luck. He sets out to Big Picture Studios to pitch a new script to the Chief, aided by his ever-present sidekicks Dom Bell (Dom DeLuise) and Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman). His big idea: the first silent motion picture in forty years. At first the Chief (Sid Caesar), who is in danger of losing the studio to the (literally) rabid and greedy New York conglomerate Engulf & Devour (Harold Gould and Ron Carey), rejects the idea, but Funn convinces him that if he can get Hollywood's biggest stars to be in the film, he could save the studio.Funn, Eggs, and Bell proceed to recruit various people for the film. Their first target is Burt Reynolds, whom they first surprise in his shower. This does not go well, but they are able to sign him on by appearing at his house in disguise (and almost getting him killed by a steamroller). They recruit James Caan despite a disastrous lunch in his broken trailer, and then torture Liza Minnelli at the studio commissary (fortunately, she already badly wanted to be in the movie).They then disguise themselves as Flamenco dancers to get close to Anne Bancroft at a nightclub, and sign her on as well after a comical dance sequence. News breaks out that the Chief has taken ill and is in the hospital. While there, Mel phones Marcel Marceau in Paris who apparently declines the offer, delivering the only line of dialogue in the film, in French: ""Non!"" When asked by the others what Marceau said, Funn explains he doesn't understand French.Paul Newman is seen on the hospital grounds. After leading them on a wild Hollywood-style chase in electric wheelchairs, he asks to be in the film. Funn and company reply with the typical Hollywood-esque ""We'll get back to you."" In the next shot, a newspaper ad indicates that they ""ink"" Newman to do the movie.In the process of their search for stars, the trio have a number of brief but funny misadventures, including a mixup between two German Shepherds (one trained as a seeing-eye dog, the other most assuredly not), a flying blueberry pie, and several (mostly unsuccessful) efforts by Marty Eggs to seduce various women. Their most notable encounter involves a Coca-Cola machine that dispenses cans by launching them like grenades.Engulf and Devour, meanwhile, worry that Funn will save Big Picture Studios and they will be unable to buy it. They attempt to ""stop Funn with sex"" by sending voluptuous nightclub sensation Vilma Kaplan (Bernadette Peters) to seduce Funn and pretend to be in love with him. Funn falls head over heels, but when Eggs and Bell reveal the truth to him on the day before filming begins, the director returns to drinking. Ironically, moments after this turn of events, Vilma is seen calling Mr. Engulf with the news that she is quitting: she has fallen for Funn for real. We see Mel stopping by a liquor store and buying what first appears to be an advertising prop in the store's window, but is actually a genuine giant bottle of liquor. After a misadventure involving a Skid Row hotel room and a murphy bed, Funn ends up in an alley where he dispenses booze from his giant bottle and is proclaimed ""King of the Winos"".After a few hours of hitting the local gin mills, Vilma and Funn's associates find the would-be ""King"" passed out in a pile of his ""subjects"", but several hundred cups of coffee sober him up. Funn's silent movie is completed in record time. Unfortunately, the only copy of it is stolen from the theater by Engulf & Devour just before its big premiere.Vilma volunteers to stall the movie theater's audience with her nightclub act while Funn and his associates go out to steal back their film. They succeed, but are chased by Engulf and Devour's thuggish executives. They are eventually cornered, but fortunately they are near the violent Coke machine, which they use against their foes. Most of the executives, including Mr. Devour, are disabled by the exploding cans of Coke, allowing Funn, Eggs, and Bell to escape. They hurry the film to the theater, where it is shown for the first time. In the meantime, Eggs has gotten himself tangled up in the film and he is immediately rushed up to the projection booth with the film wrapped around him. After the movie is over, the audience applauds wildly and leaps to its feet while balloons and streamers fill the air. ""They seem to like it,"" Funn says.The film ends with the jubilant audience filing out of the theater past Funn, Eggs, Bell, Vilma, and the recovered studio chief. At the end, a title card is shown: ""This was a true story."""
The Pink Panther Strikes Again,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075066/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After escaping from an insane asylum, the bonkers Charles Dreyfus sends 26 assassins on the trail of the forever bumbling Inspector Clouseau. Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) escapes from the mental asylum and tries to kill Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers). He doesn't succeed at first, so he takes on another strategy, namely to build a Doomsday machine and demand that someone else kills Jacques Clouseau, or Dreyfus will use the machine to wipe out whole cities and even whole countries. With about twenty-six assassins from all over the globe on his tail, Clouseau decides to find Dreyfus alone and put him back in the mental asylum.—Lars J. Aas <larsa@colargol.edb.tih.no> Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), the Chief Inspector of the Surete and superior of Inspector Clouseau was last seen in The Return of the Pink Panther (1975) suffering a breakdown cause of Clouseau's torment. He decides to try and kill him, but fails and was last seen confined to a mental asylum. This movie begins three years later, Dreyfus' doctors think is well enough to be released, but before he is, Clouseau visits him and agitates him into killing him, so he's not released. But he escapes and tries to kill Clouseau, but fails. He then decides to recruit some of the best criminals in the world, and then kidnaps a noted English scientist and creates a device that can destroy the world. After using it, his only demand is Clouseau. So every country in the world sends their best assassin to kill him but fail. And Clouseau tries to find Dreyfus before he does any more damage.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Now seriously mentally ill after working with Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) for such a long time, Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) escapes from the mental asylum in which he was being held and vows to destroy Clouseau forever. He kidnaps an eminent scientist and forces him to build a machine capable of destroying the world, with the intention of doing so unless Clouseau is delivered to him. Meanwhile, oblivious to the danger he faces, Clouseau is currently only worried about not letting his manservant, Cato (Burt Kwouk), get the best of him.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> Former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is nearly set to be released from a mental hospital after being cleared. However, a visit from current Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) resurrects his insanity, and he is denied leaving. Determined to take out Clouseau once and for all, he escapes and blows up Clouseau's apartment, but fails to kill Clouseau. As a back-up plan, he abducts a famous scientist in order to build a Doomsday machine which vaporizes whatever it shoots. Dreyfus threatens to use it unless Clouseau is exterminated, so reluctantly, twenty-six countries send their top assassin to kill Clouseau. His clumsiness saves him again, and the assassin's attempts kill each other. In a conquest to save the world, Clouseau heads out to put an end to Dreyfus' terror once and for all. At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from the murderous insanity that saw him repeatedly attempt to kill the thorn in his side, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. He is about to be released but Clouseau (Peter Sellers), who is now Chief Inspector and has arrived to speak on Dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit, and his clumsiness and repeated tendency towards accidents drive Dreyfus insane again.The opening credits begin with an animated Inspector Clouseau entering a cinema hall to watch a film. He is constantly beleaguered by the Pink Panther, however, and when the Panther appears on the screen impersonating various features (Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Batman, King Kong, The Sound of Music, Dracula, Singin' in the Rain, and Steamboat Bill Jr.), the Inspector finally loses his temper and climbs into the screen to get him... ending up trapped inside.Soon thereafter, Dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing Clouseau. His first attempt involves planting a bomb whilst Clouseau destructively duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk), who is under orders, from Clouseau, to keep Clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. The bomb merely destroys Clouseau's apartment whilst Clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because Clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call by Dreyfus which was meant to keep him in place for the bombing. Cato, however, ends up in the hospital.Dreyfus sets his sights higher. Using his knowledge of the underworld, he enlists the help of an army of vicious criminals, kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a ""doomsday weapon"" in return for his daughter's freedom. As Hugo Fassbender cannot bear to hear his daughter undergoing Dreyfus's torture (which consists of forcing her to listen to nails dragged across a blackboard), he agrees.
Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, with typically chaotic results, as Scotland Yard Section Director Alec Drummond (Colin Blakely) and Superintendent Quinlan (Leonard Rossiter) painfully learn. However, Clouseau manages to set his sights on Jarvis, the cross-dressing butler of the Fassbenders, and while Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau follows a clue found on the crime scene to the Oktoberfest in Germany. Meanwhile Dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum. Disintegrating the United Nations headquarters in New York City before the disbelieving eyes of the world, he blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States (a thinly veiled impersonation of Gerald Ford, advised by a similarly poorly camouflaged Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau.
Forced to take Dreyfus's threat seriously, several nations send assassins to kill Clouseau at the Oktoberfest. Many of the nations, however, instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to ensure that their own country can kill Clouseau and thus win Dreyfus's favor and possibly get hold of the Doomsday Machine themselves. This, combined with Clouseau's typical bumbling fashion, enables Clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen, so that the assassins all kill each other instead. In the end, only the operatives of Egypt and Russia remain alive.The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif), sneaking into Clouseau's hotel room, shoots a man he believes to be Clouseau (who is in fact one of Dreyfus's henchmen, who had taken it upon himself to kill Clouseau). The Russian operative, Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who has sneaked into Clouseau's room, seduces the Egyptian, similarly mistaking him for Clouseau. His passionate sexuality convinces her not to assassinate him; when the real Clouseau makes an appearance, he is surprised to discover a beautiful yet nude woman in his bed who confuses him further by declaring her undying passion for him, snogging him all over his face every few minutes in the process, and by finding a dead man in his bath. A tattoo on the dead man, combined with Olga's dismissively revealed knowledge, reveals to Clouseau Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. He leaves immediately leaving a confused and frustrated Olga behind him.Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but his joy is soured by a bad case of toothache. Clouseau, who has arrived in the village near Dreyfus's castle but has been denied entry into the castle by a mischievous drawbridge, eventually infiltrates Dreyfus's castle hideout disguised as a dentist, intoxicates Dreyfus (and himself) with Nitrous oxide, and pulls one of Dreyfus's healthy teeth. Realising the deception, Dreyfus orders Clouseau killed, but Clouseau escapes.Enraged, Dreyfus means to seek vengeance on the world by destroying England; as he prepares for this, Clouseau, who has been thrown into the castle's barnyard, is literally catapulted onto Dreyfus's doomsday machine. Clouseau's weight redirects the dis-integrator so that the beam hits Dreyfus (causing him to start to disintegrate, from the feet up) and the castle. As Dreyfus's henchmen, Fassbender, and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" on the castle's pipe organ, while gradually disintegrating. The castle then disappears entirely, taking Dreyfus with it.Returning to Paris, Clouseau is reunited with Olga, who has dismissed Cato for the evening and intends on completing her seduction of Clouseau. This is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, who chooses this time to once more follow his orders and attack Clouseau and Olga. The consequent struggle ends when all three are hurled by a reclining bed into the Seine. Immediately thereafter, a cartoon image of Clouseau emerges from the water, which has been tinted pink, and begins swimming, unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him with a sharp-toothed, open mouth (a reference to the film Jaws made obvious by the thematic music). The film ends when the animated Clouseau gets chased by the shark in the water (which was actually the pink panther) as the credits roll."

Taxi Driver,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mentally unstable veteran works as a nighttime taxi driver in New York City, where the perceived decadence and sleaze fuels his urge for violent action. Travis Bickle is an ex-Marine and Vietnam War veteran living in New York City. As he suffers from insomnia, he spends his time working as a taxi driver at night, watching porn movies at seedy cinemas during the day, or thinking about how the world, New York in particular, has deteriorated into a cesspool. He's a loner who has strong opinions about what is right and wrong with mankind. For him, the one bright spot in humanity is Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine. After an incident, he believes he has to do whatever he needs to make the world a better place.—Huggo Hiding in the shadows of bustling mid-1970s New York City, depressed former U.S. Marine Travis Bickle prowls the neon-lit night streets of the metropolis in his yellow cab, looking for excitement. But Travis is a nobody amid nobodies. As a result, trapped by an increasingly distorted perception of reality, the chronically insomniac lone wolf delves deeper and deeper into a world of obsession and vitriolic revulsion. After all, the endless string of bitter rejections from unobtainable objects of desire and condemned young souls can only break one's spirit. Now his crystal-clear plan starts to take shape. And as sleep-deprived Travis braces up to clean this filthy city in a flaming manifesto of unbridled violence, his lethal weapons will become the grim messengers of truth. His truth.—Nick Riganas Travis Bickle is an insomniac ex-marine who works the night shift as a taxi driver in 1970s New York. Chronically lonely and socially inept, he attempts to woo an attractive presidential campaign worker, but his misguided ideas about romance fall flat. Increasingly paranoid, Bickle fancies himself as the decaying city's saviour.—anonymous New York City taxi driver Travis Bickle constantly, almost obsessively, reflects on the ugly corruption of life around him, and becomes increasingly disturbed over his own loneliness and alienation. In nearly every phase of his life, he remains a complete outsider, failing to make emotional contact with anyone. Unable to sleep night after night, he haunts the local pornography emporiums to find diversion, and begins desperately thinking about an escape from his depressing existence.—filmfactsman Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) goes to a New York City taxi depot where he applies for a job as a driver to the tough-talking personnel officer (Joe Spinell). Travis claims that he is an honorably discharged Vietnam Vet Marine.Travis gets the job for the night shift due to his chronic insomnia.Travis is a lonely and depressed young man of 26 years. His origins and hometown are unknown. He sends his parents letters as well as birthday and Christmas cards, lying about his life and saying he works with the Secret Service. Travis spends his restless days alone in his rundown apartment somewhere in Manhattan, or in seedy porn theaters on and off 42nd Street. At one porn theater he tries to make an advance on the concession lady to no avail. He works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Sometimes during his breaks, he goes to a local all-night diner to have something to eat or just a few cups of coffee where fellow taxi drivers also hang out during their late-night lunch breaks. One of whom is a self-appointed philosophical type named Wizard (Peter Boyle).During taxi driving, Travis spies and becomes infatuated with a woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine, who is running for the presidential nomination and is promising dramatic social change. Travis spies Betsy joking with a co-worker named Tom (Albert Brooks). Travis works up the nerve to ask her out and Betsy is initially intrigued by Travis. She agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness.
Travis is further revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Travis fails to drive off quickly enough and her pimp, ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), reaches the cab. Sport forcibly grabs Iris away with him and gives Travis a crumpled twenty dollar bill as a bribe not to say anything.During one of his shifts, Travis picks up Senator Palantine and an aide. He tells the senator he plans to vote for him. The senator asks Travis ""what's the one thing that bugs you the most?"" and Travis responds that he would like the next president to ""clean the scum off New York City.""
On their date, however due to his lack of social skills, Travis takes Betsy to a porno theater to view a Swedish ""sex education"" film. Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain and she refuses to speak with him. Going back into the campaign office, Travis confronts Betsy and shouts that she will ""burn in hell like the rest of them"".Rejected and depressed, Travis later picks up a man who appears to be as mentally unbalanced as he is. The man tells Travis to park outside an apartment building while letting the meter run. He tells Travis to look at the woman in the window and tells him that's his wife in her boyfriend's apartment. He tells Travis he plans to kill them both.
One evening at the diner, Travis tries to express his despair to Wizard, but finds Wizard's weak response: ""that's just about the stupidest thing I ever heard"".Travis's thoughts turn more violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime (especially prostitution) that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and buys a number of pistols from an illegal drug/weapons dealer (Steven Prince).
Travis develops an ominously intense interest in Senator Palantine's public appearances and it seems that he somehow blames the presidential hopeful for his own failure at wooing Betsy and maybe hopes to include her boss in his growing list of targets. Back at his apartment with his newly purchased guns, he begins a program of intense physical training and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm (""You talking' to me?""). Later, he hangs around a Palantine rally and asks a suspicious secret service man about joining the service before disappearing into the crowd.In an accidental warm-up, Travis randomly walks into a robbery in a run-down grocery and shoots the would-be thief (Nat Grant) in the face; adding to the bizarre violence, the sympathetic grocery owner (Victor Argo) encourages Travis to flee the scene and then proceeds to club the near-dead stickup man with a steel pole.
Later, seeing Iris on the street, he follows her. Another day later, Travis asks to pay for her time, and is sent to Sport. A tense conversation ensues but Sport sends Travis up to Iris's room. Once in her room, Travis does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind.The next day, Travis and Iris meet for breakfast at a local coffee shop and Travis becomes obsessed with saving this naive child-woman who thinks hanging out with hookers, pimps and drug dealers is more ""hip"" than dating young boys and going to school. Iris considers Travis's offer but then Sport seduces and convinces her to stay, while (seemingly) Travis spies into the window from his cab. Travis writes a note to Iris including all his money and stating that he doesn't intend to survive.
Any lingering doubt in the viewer's mind about Travis Bickle's sanity is obliterated when he is suddenly and shockingly shown to be sporting a crude Mohawk haircut at a public rally. He creeps through the crowd and prepares to assassinate Senator Palantine but is spotted by Secret Service men and flees.Travis returns to his apartment to collect all his guns, then drives to ""Alphabet City"" (an area of New York's Lower East side consisting of Avenues A through E). He walks up to Sport and confronts him. When Sport flicks a lit cigarette at him, Travis says ""suck on this"" and shoots Sport in the belly. Storming into the brothel, Travis blows the bouncer's hand off. Sport, who has followed Travis, grazes Travis neck with a bullet (causing an arterial gush from his neck) but Travis unloads one of his guns into Sport, killing him. Travis again shoots the screaming bouncer who follows him up the stairs, slapping him. Iris' mafioso customer shoots Travis in the arm and Travis shoots his face off. The bouncer tackles Travis but Travis stabs him through the hand and finally kills the bouncer with a bullet to the brain. He then calmly tries repeatedly to fire a bullet into his own head under his chin but all the weapons are empty so he resigns himself to resting on a convenient sofa until police arrive. When they do, the blood-soaked Travis mimes shooting himself in the head and then blissfully thinks of the mayhem and carnage in his wake.A brief epilogue shows Travis recuperating from the incident. He has received a handwritten letter from Iris' parents who thank him for saving their daughter, and the media (in newspaper clipping) hails him as a hero for saving her as well. Travis blithely returns to his job and suddenly seems on more friendly terms with the other cabbies. One night one of his fares happens to be Betsy. She comments about his saving of Iris and Travis' own media fame, yet Travis denies being any sort of hero. He drops her off without charging her. As he is driving off, he gets a strange look on his face and adjusts his cab's rear view mirror, giving the impression that his irrationality is about to break through again."

Living in a city within an enclosed dome, there is little or no work for humans to perform, and inhabitants are free to pursue all of the pleasures of life. There is one catch however: your life is limited and when you reach thirty, it is terminated in a quasi-religious ceremony known as ""carrousel"". Some, known as ""runners"", try to escape their fate when the time comes, and it's the job of Sandmen to track them down and kill them. Logan (Michael York) is such a man, and with several years before his own termination date, thinks nothing of the job he does.

The citizens live a hedonistic lifestyle but, to prevent overpopulation, everyone must undergo the rite of ""Carrousel"" when they reach the age of 30. There, they are killed under the guise of being ""renewed"".To track this, each person is implanted at birth with a ""life-clock"" crystal in the palm of the hand that changes color as they get older and begins blinking as they approach their ""Last Day."" Most residents accept this chance for rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as ""Runners"". An elite team of policemen known as ""Sandmen"", outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called ""Deep Sleep"", are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape.Logan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel rite, Logan finds an ankh among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find ""Sanctuary"", a mythic place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives.Logan learns that the Sandmen have lost 1,056 Runners this way. The computer instructs Logan to find Sanctuary and destroy it, a mission which it code names ""Procedure 033-03"", which he must keep secret from the other Sandmen of Deep Sleep. Then, by a procedure it calls ""retrogram"", the computer changes the color of his life clock to flashing red, suddenly making him four years closer to Carrousel. Scared, he asks if the four years will be restored to him when his mission is completed but receives no response. In order to escape this, Logan is now forced to become a Runner. Logan meets Jessica and explains his situation. They meet with the underground group that leads them to the periphery of the city.Logan learns that the ankh symbol is actually a key that unlocks an exit from the city. They come out into a frozen cave, with Francis following closely behind. In the cave, they meet Box, a robot designed to capture food for the city from the outside. Logan discovers, to his horror, that Box also captures escaped Runners and freezes them for food. Before Box can freeze Logan and Jessica, they escape, causing the cave to collapse on the robot.Once outside, Logan and Jessica notice that their life clocks are no longer operational. They see the Sun for the first time and discover that the remains of human civilization have become a wilderness. They explore an old, seemingly abandoned city which was once Washington, D.C. In the ruins of the United States Senate chamber, they discover an elderly man living with many cats. His appearance is a shock to them, since neither has ever seen anyone over the age of thirty. The old man recounts what he remembers about what happened to humanity outside the city, and Logan realizes that Sanctuary has always been a myth.However, Francis has followed them and he and Logan fight. Logan fatally wounds Francis; as he dies, Francis sees that Logan's life clock is now clear and assumes Logan has renewed. Logan and Jessica persuade the old man to return to the city with them as proof that life exists outside the domed city. Leaving the man outside, the two enter and try to convince everyone that Carrousel is a lie and unnecessary. The two are captured by other Sandmen and taken to the computer, which interrogates Logan about Procedure 033-03 and asks if he completed his mission.Logan insists, ""There is no Sanctuary"". What he had found was ""old ruins, exposed"", ""an old man"", and that the missing Runners were ""all frozen"". These answers are not accepted by the computer, even after scanning Logan's mind, and the computer overloads, causing the city's systems to fail violently and release the exterior seals. Logan, Jessica, and the other citizens flee the ruined city. Once outside, the citizens see the old man, the first human they have met who is older than thirty, proving that they can, indeed, live their lives much longer."
Marathon Man,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074860/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the shocking murder of his older brother, a New York history student finds himself inexplicably hounded by shadowy government agents on the trail of a Nazi war criminal who is trying to retrieve smuggled diamonds. Thomas ""Babe"" Levy, whose brother Henry James ""Doc"" Levy is an oil business executive, is a Ph.D. candidate in History at Columbia University. He is also training as a marathon runner. Babe is paying homage to his deceased father, H.B. Levy, in pursuing the same studies as he, the father who committed suicide while being under investigation in the Communist witch hunts. Babe's work does not sit well with Doc who wants Babe to move on with his life. While at Columbia, Babe meets and begins to date Elsa Opel, a foreign exchange student also in History. While out for a walk in Central Park late one night, Babe and Elsa are mugged, the unusual aspect of it being that their attackers were men in suits. Babe will learn that the mugging was not a random attack after someone close to Babe is found murdered, the deceased whom was not whom he purported to be. From here, Babe is thrown into an international conspiracy concerning Nazi war criminal Christian Szell in hiding, and a large cache of diamonds. In the process, Babe learns that Szell's associates are after him believing that he was passed sensitive information by the deceased before his death. Not knowing anything about what's going on, Babe has to decide whom he can and cannot trust while he works to find out what's going on. In Babe discovering what's happening around him, his issue with Szell becomes personal.—Huggo Babe Levy is a Columbia University graduate student and avid runner who is haunted by the memory of his father's suicide, brought about by the McCarthy witch-hunts. Babe's brother, Doc, an American secret agent, helps sneak Szell, an old Nazi, into the US from South America. Szell's brother, who has watched over a fortune in jewels taken from Jewish concentration camp victims, has died, and Szell has come to New York to collect the booty. After killing Doc, Szell uses the tools of his dentist's trade to torture Babe for information the student doesn't possess. Putting his marathon training to use, Babe escapes Szell, and eventually the pursuer becomes the pursued. In New York, marathon runner Thomas ""Babe"" Levy is a graduate student who researches history as his father, who committed suicide after being investigated in the Communist witch hunts of the McCarthy era. His brother Henry James ""Doc"" Levy appears out of the blue from time to time because his family never knows where he is, working as a government agent. One of his charges is an infamous Nazi war criminal whom he has just told is no longer welcome in the United States. Dr. Christian Szell has a fortune hidden in a safe deposit box and is convinced that Babe knows whether or not it is safe to go to pick it up and will stop at nothing to find out.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Thomas ""Babe"" Levy (Dustin Hoffman) is a history Ph.D. candidate and avid marathon runner researching the same field as his father, who committed suicide after being investigated in the Communist witch hunts of the Joseph McCarthy era. Babe's brother, Henry James Levy (Roy Scheider), known only as ""Doc"", poses as an oil company executive but in fact is a U.S. government agent working for a secret agency headed up by Director Peter Janeway (William Devane). Babe is not aware of his brother's true occupation.Doc is often supposedly out of the country on business for extended periods of time, but comes to New York under the guise of a visit to Babe. The brother of a Nazi war criminal possesses a safety deposit box key, but is killed in a traffic accident (after a road rage altercation with a short tempered middle-aged Jewish American motorist). Doc suspects that the criminal, Dr. Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier) will be arriving to retrieve an extremely valuable diamond collection. Szell later sends a burly assassin named Chen (James Wing Woo) to kill Doc in his Paris hotel room, but Doc fights the hit man and breaks his back.Babe enters into a relationship with a young woman named Elsa Opel (Marthe Keller), who claims to be from Switzerland. One night while out on a date Elsa and Babe are mugged in a park by two men dressed in suits. Some time later, Doc takes the couple to lunch, where he tricks Elsa into revealing that she has been lying to Babe about her background. Though Doc suspects she may have some connection to Szell, he tells Babe only that she is seeking an American husband so that she can become a U.S. citizen.After Szell arrives in America, Doc meets him to tell the former Nazi he is not welcome in the country, and also to warn Szell to stay away from Babe. Szell casually accepts the pronouncement, but then swiftly knifes Doc, wounding him severely. Doc is able to make it back to his brother's apartment, but collapses and dies in Babe's arms without telling him anything. The police interrogate Babe for hours, until government agents led by Peter Janeway arrive. Janeway asks Babe what Doc told him before he died, and informs Babe of his brother's career as a U.S. government agent. Babe insists that his brother did not tell him anything, but Janeway feels that Doc struggled all the way to Babe's apartment to give him vital information of some kind.Babe is later abducted from his apartment by Szell's henchmen, Karl and Erhardt (the two men from the park). In an infamous sequence, Babe is tortured by Szell, a skilled dentist, who repeatedly asks ""Is it safe?"" Confused by the question code phrase he does not understand, Babe denies any knowledge, but is tortured. The dentist offers him oil of cloves, an anesthetic, as positive inducement to cooperate. Eventually, Babe loses consciousness and Szell pauses his torture.Babe is then rescued by Janeway, who apparently kills Szell's bodyguards and takes Babe from Szell's hideout. As he drives, Janeway explains that Szell is in America to sell off his large cache of diamonds, which he had taken from Jews he had exterminated at Auschwitz during World War II. Janeway continually presses Babe about Doc's dying words, but Babe again insists he knows nothing. Frustrated, Janeway reveals himself as a double agent working with the Nazi criminal all along, and he turns Babe over to Karl and Erhardt (Janeway had only faked killing them). As it turns out, Szell is one of Janeway's highest level informants, and had informed on other Nazi war criminals in return for immunity.Delivered back into Szell's hands, the Nazi criminal has a curiously kindly conversation with Babe before calmly explaining why he is holding Babe for questioning. Szell suspected that Doc would attempt to rob him of his diamonds, or rat on him to authorities; thus his desire to know if it's ""safe"" to withdraw the diamonds, i.e., whether Doc told Babe any incriminating information. Still unable to extract anything from Babe, he proceeds to drill into one of Babe's healthy teeth. Babe eventually escapes again, this time on his own, with Janeway and Szell's two henchmen giving chase in a car. Though exhausted and barefoot, he is able to outrun his pursuers in part by remembering famous ""marathon man"" Abebe Bikila, who ran barefoot.After inviting a neighborhood acquaintance and his toughs to break into his apartment and steal his pistol (the same pistol his father used to commit suicide), Babe phones Elsa, who agrees to meet him with a car. She drives him to a country home as a hideout. Babe guesses that she has set him up; she confesses that Szell's dead brother owned the home, and that she was one of Szell's couriers. Janeway and Szell's men arrive, but Babe avoids an ambush by taking Elsa hostage. In another twist, Janeway kills Szell's men and offers to let Babe kill Szell in revenge for Doc's death if Janeway can have the diamonds. Babe agrees, but as he leaves to find Szell, Janeway attempts to shoot Babe, but kills Elsa instead when she tries to alert Babe. Angered, Babe guns down Janeway.Back in New York, Szell attempts to determine the value of his diamonds. However, he chooses an appraiser in the Diamond District in midtown Manhattan, where many of the shop owners are Jewish. A shop assistant who is also an Auschwitz survivor believes he has recognized Szell as a wanted Nazi criminal. After Szell hurriedly leaves the shop, an elderly Jewish woman also recognizes him, but passersby think she is senile. Trying to cross the street to get closer to Szell in order to expose him she is hit by a taxicab, causing a crowd to assemble to assist her. Amidst the confusion, the shop assistant appears again, directly confronting Szell. Becoming increasingly paranoid, Szell slits the man's throat with a retractable blade concealed in his sleeve.Szell retrieves his diamonds from the bank, but is taken hostage by Babe as he attempts to leave, who inconspicuously forces him into Central Park and into one of the pump rooms at the south end of the Reservoir. Babe holds Szell at gunpoint on a scaffold and seizes the diamonds; rather than kill Szell, Babe informs him that he will allow Szell to live and keep as many diamonds as he can swallow. Szell initially refuses, prompting Babe to begin throwing the diamonds into the water below them. Szell relents and swallows one diamond, but then refuses to cooperate further. Szell goes on to insult Babe, and after he spits in Babe's face, a fight erupts in which Szell tries to stab Babe. Babe throws the remainder of the diamonds down the scaffold steps towards the water; Szell dives for them, but stumbles, and fatally falls on his own knife blade. Picking up his gun, Babe exits the pump room and heads out into Central Park. Stopping by the Reservoir, he throws the gun into the water."

They make their living stealing horses or rustling cattle from ranchers, laughing all the way, spending their money on whiskey and whores.Logan and his gang are particularly upset by the hanging of a friend by rancher David Braxton (John McLiam), an egomaniacal gay local land baron who took the law into his own hands. Braxton has horses, and a daughter, worth stealing.Logan's men pull off a daring train robbery, only to lose much of the money. The gang retaliates against Braxton by hanging his foreman Pete Marker (Richard Bradford) on the same noose.Posing as an aspiring cattle rancher, Logan buys an abandoned ranch next to Braxton's to serve as a relay station for moving stolen horses across the plains.While his men ride off across the Missouri River and north of the border to steal Canadian Mounted Police horses, Logan plants crops at their new farm and enters into a relationship with Braxton's virginal daughter, Jane (Kathleen Lloyd). He knows how to court a woman by brewing Chinese tea in the Wild West.Jane is on bad terms with her father and has taken a shine to Logan in any event,
seems to be fascinated by the bad guys and demands sex, saying: ""Do you want to have sexual intercourse?"" while flirting with Logan.Braxton, obsessed with his rustling problem, his daughter, and avenging his friend's murder, sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton (Marlon Brando), a notorious regulator from Medicine Hat, Wyoming, who, for a price, will take care of rustlers personally, one at a time. Regulators were mercenary frontier agents famous for their ruthlessness and their ability to kill without warning from long distances with their trademark Creekmore rifles.Clayton arrives with a fancy wardrobe, a perfumed scent, an Irish brogue and a rifle with which he is deadly accurate from afar. Clayton bursts in on the funeral of the murdered foreman dressed like a western dandy in fringed leather coat and scarf, bellowing and yanking the corpse up out of the open casket to borrow a few of the ice cubes used to keep the body from decomposing as a compress for a tooth-ache.Clayton is portrayed comically, but he is a sadistic, perverse, and psychotic killer who comes across as much more lawless than the criminals he's hunting.Quickly suspicious of Logan, who doesn't strike him as much of a farmer, Clayton dons a variety of disguises to pick off Logan's gang, one by one.Impersonating a preacher ""Jim Ferguson,"" Clayton tries to cajole Little Todd into confessing that he is part of the gang. He kills Todd by dragging him with a rope through the raging Missouri, seemingly aware of the fact that Todd cannot swim.Clayton spies on Logan with binoculars and taunts Braxton about his daughter's affair with a horse thief. Braxton attempts to discharge him but Clayton is determined to finish what he starts.He amuses himself by shooting two more of Logan's partners from a distance and then by wearing a granny dress while brutally killing Logan's closest friend, Cal (Harry Dean Stanton) with a handmade weapon.Logan knows it's kill or be killed by Clayton. He also wants vengeance against Braxton for having hired the regulator in the first place, despite his feelings for Jane. Now it's up to Logan to hunt down Clayton.One night after a campfire goes dark with Clayton serenading his horse, Logan gets his revenge catching up with him while he's asleep and then slitting his throat: ""You know what woke you up? You just had your throat cut!""Logan then comes after Braxton. There's a shootout where Braxton, who everyone now believes is infirm with a stroke, pulls out a gun while he's sitting in a wheelchair and shoots the unawares Logan. Logan then shoots back killing Braxton.Logan abandons his farm and packs up to leave the area and Jane, although he acknowledges that he and Jane might renew their relationship another time, another place."
The Smurfs and the Magic Flute,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074539/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A villain named McCreep steals the Smurfs' magic flute, an instrument that makes people dance wildly, and uses it to rob them. The Smurf King sends out Peewit to track down the thief and retrieve the flute. A villain named McCreep steals the Smurfs' magic flute, an instrument that makes people dance wildly, and uses it to rob them. The Smurf King sends out Peewit to track down the thief and retrieve the flute. Now Johan and Pirlouit must get it back at all costs, so they head to the magical kingdom of Smurfs to ask for their help.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} The Middle Ages. Much to his surprise, Peewit, a mischievous court jester and not-so-talented musician, stumbles upon an unusual flute with only six holes. But, before long, Peewit realises the musical instrument has powers beyond imagination: when played, people dance to exhaustion. Of course, this extraordinary attribute catches villainous McCreep's attention, who plans to use it to rob unsuspecting citizens. When the flute ends up in his hands, Peewit and young knight Johan embark on a long journey to the land of the elusive Smurfs to ask for help. Can Papa Smurf help them retrieve the magic flute and save the day?—Nick Riganas Based upon the 9th album (""The Flute with Six Smurfs"") of the Belgian comic-strip, ""Johan and Peewit,"" which featured the very first appearance of the Smurfs.The story takes place in the Middle-Ages. After young squire Sir Johan wins in a jousting tournament in his kingdom, his friend Peewit, the kingdom's court jester dwarf, celebrates by singing a victory song, with only one problem; he is so terrible a singer he drives the whole kingdom into hiding (not to mention attracting a powerful thunderstorm), and only Johan was kind enough to escort Peewit back to the castle in the rain.The next morning, a musical instrument merchant arrives in front of the castle to sell instruments to Peewit, but only the nameless King and Johann are present to meet him. After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit. Without a word, Oilycreep swiftly rides to the kingdom, where a big royal feast is being held, and a group of minstrels are playing for the kingdom (with Peewit unsuccessfully trying to get involved). Already invited as a guest, Oilycreep meets Peewit, who takes him to his room and shows him, as well as playing, the magic flute (but not before two mysterious tiny blue people, riding on a stork, unsuccessfully try to sneak it away from his room). Oilycreep asks Peewit to let him play it for a while. Peewit advises him beforehand to stop playing when he says so. But just as Oilycreep is about to play the flute, we cut to the minstrel band at the feast, and Oilycreep swiftly rides away into the dark.The very next morning, a very enraged Peewit is tied up in his room. The King's advisor Lady Prattle, concerned and shocked, goes to untie him, and Peewit then goes berserk, furiously running around and chopping objects with an axe. Upon bumping into Johan and the King, Peewit complains that Oilycreep has stolen his magic flute! The King doesn't take this seriously at first, but Johan intuitively knows how serious the situation is, and Peewit claims that Oilycreep will use the flute to rob people. Johan and Peewit jump into action, searching from kingdom to kingdom, while Oilycreep, of course, begins using the flute to steal the riches from the people, piling them up in his wagon! (During the confusion, the aforementioned tiny blue people again try and fail to retrieve the flute.) But once our two heroes finally confront him, Oilycreep plays the flute and makes short work of Johan and Peewit, leaving them behind. The two realize that as long as Oilycreep has the flute, he is unstoppable, so Johan decides to consult with a magic-savvy friend of his - the wizard Homnibus.While performing magic spells in his home, Homnibus is surprised to see Johan and Peewit, who are shown in by his young assistant Oliver. Over dinner, Homnibus regrets that he has no solution to breaking the spell of the flute, and says that the only ones who may know are the original makers of the flute, the ""Smurfs."" Although Homnibus does not know exactly where the Land of the Smurfs is, he decides to perform a spell on them called ""hypnokinesis,"" in which they will be put into a deep sleep, and their bodies will be spiritually copied over to another area (similar in concept toThe Matrix (1999)). Once this spell is performed on Johan and Peewit, they awaken in a beautiful forest in the Land of the Smurfs. They meet one of the Smurfs, a tiny blue humanoid creature (just like the ones who tried to retrieve the flute), roughly 5 to 6 inches tall, wearing white pants & working cap. (And most of the time he speaks, a magic chime is heard in his voice.) The Smurf takes our two heroes to the Smurf Village, and find that the Smurfs are all nearly identical in appearance (and are 100 years old), except for their patriarch, Papa Smurf (who is 542), who has a white beard and wears red pants & cap in lieu of white, and the houses they live in are big mushrooms, the tallest ones are nearly as big as Johan. In the Smurfs' own language, nouns and verbs are replaced with the word ""smurf."" Putting it in song, Papa Smurf states that although all the Smurfs look the same, they can each be identified by their personalities, and introduces nearly a dozen of them: Greedy Smurf, Poet Smurf, Farmer Smurf, Lazy Smurf, Handy Smurf, Clumsy Smurf, Festive Smurf, Grouchy Smurf, the bespectacled Brainy Smurf (the only Smurf to look remotely different from the rest), and Hefty Smurf. Returning to urgent affairs, Johan asks Papa Smurf for a way to break the magic effect of the flute. While he regrets that is impossible, he has a better idea: to build a new magic flute, so Peewit can fight with Oilycreep on equal terms. The Smurfs get to work immediately, and all through the night, they chop down a special tree in the forest (at the center of which is the part needed to make the flute). While the Smurfs get to work on carving the flute from the wood, a song number ensues in which a bored Peewit realizes that he can ask for a glass of water as ""a smurf of smurf."" Johan is laughing in amusement at this, as the Smurfs cannot understand him, and bring him the wrong things, until they finally give him a glass of water, upon which a stressed-out Peewit angrily changes his mind! A while later, the new flute is finished, but Festive Smurf wants to throw a big party for their hard work, which they do, later that night, in the Smurf Village. After a very cheerful party with music, fireworks, and food, Papa Smurf is just about to give Johan and Peewit the new flute, until they are suddenly awakened from their sleep too soon by Homnibus, who was very worried, as they were asleep for 2 days! When they demand to be sent back, Homnibus tries the spell again, but is exhausted from his efforts and gets a headache, for which he must get rest. While Oliver tends to the wizard, Johan and Peewit are frustrated, worried about what Oilycreep is doing at that moment...At the same time, Oilycreep rides to the bleak kingdom of his crooked associate Lord Mumford (AKA: Earl Flatbroke), to whom he makes a fascinating proposal: For all the riches he stole from the people, Oilycreep wants to gather an army against the King's castle. He proposes to sail from the Port of Tromanack (AKA: Terminack) to an undisclosed island, where he will recruit men for his army. Unbeknownst to them, the same two Smurfs (who tried to get the flute back from Oilycreep earlier) were listening. Meanwhile, a dejected Johan and Peewit, still in Homnibus' home, are somewhat relieved to hear from Oliver that the wizard is nicely recovering, but is asleep. But miraculously, the Smurfs (riding storks; their means of travel) arrive in front of Homnibus' home. Papa Smurf, aware of what happened, personally presents the flute to Peewit, and much to the dwarf's delight, the flute works (having tested it on Johan)! After the two scout Smurfs intervene with news on the whereabouts and plans of Oilycreep, our heroes race to the Port of Tromanack, only to see that Oilycreep has just disembarked. Later, Papa Smurf (along with three other Smurfs he selected for this mission) comes to a despondent Johan and Peewit at the port, telling them that someone knows where Oilycreep is heading, and backtracks to Lord Mumford. This gives Johan an idea, and a short time later, Lord Mumford gets a letter, supposedly from Oilycreep (actually a forgery from Johan), telling him to meet him at the secret island. He then rides to the Port of Tromanack, and he, along with three sailors (two of which are a disguised Johan and Peewit), and the Smurfs in hiding, set off...During the voyage, Peewit is obnoxiously seasick, making a spectacle of himself on the boat (with Johan sarcastically teasing him). Eventually, they make it to the island, on which is a big village full of overindulgent people. Lord Mumford goes to a bar to meet Oilycreep, who is surprised to see him, and is puzzled at the letter he got that he didn't write. When they went to look for the sailors of the boat to find out who's responsible, Johan and Peewit look around town for the two villains. The duos finally cross paths, and without a word, both Peewit and Oilycreep immediately begin their duel of the flutes, and the resulting musical noise is so powerful it causes everyone in town (even Johan and Lord Mumford) to dance! At the end of the cataclysmic musical duel, both men are exhausted and out of breath, until Peewit has enough strength to blow out one last note that finishes Oilycreep, and then reclaims the other flute as well, thus emerging the victor.Having won the battle, Johan, Peewit, and the Smurfs return to the kingdom, bringing Oilycreep and Mumford to face justice, and return all the riches to the people. Peewit wants to keep the magic flutes, but Johan firmly stresses that both flutes must be returned to the Smurfs. Thus, Peewit secretly tries to carve a fake flute, so he can give it to the Smurfs while he keeps one of the real ones. Before the Smurfs go back home, they appear before the King. Johan and Peewit personally return the flutes to Papa Smurf, who thanks them for doing the right thing, as the flutes in their possession would only bring them trouble. One of the Smurfs even suggests that Johan and Peewit may have further adventures with them in the future (which, in the comics and even the Hanna-Barbera animated series, they do). As the Smurfs fly for home on their storks, everyone waves goodbye to them from the top of the castle, but behind everyone, Peewit begins to play what looks like the magic flute, and nothing happens. Peewit kept his fake flute by mistake, and gave the real one to the Smurfs! He throws a tantrum as we pan away from the top of the castle and the credits roll."

They share an apartment and Kathy attends a private, Catholic school.Kathy invites her handsome, young music teacher, Gordon Stuart (nm0001697) to come to one of Chris's photo shoots along the ocean because she wants her older sister to hear his somewhat avant garde musical compositions. The shoot runs long, so Chris does not have a chance to hear it, but arrangements are made for him to stop by her apartment the next day to play it for her.The next day, Stuart arrives at the apartment, but Chris has forgotten the appointment and this causes her to greet him fresh out of the shower dressed in nothing but a robe. Stuart obviously hopes that if she likes his music she might be able to use some of her musical connections to help him. While he is playing a selection from his tape recorder (the composition uses a lot of environmental sounds with electronic synthesizers) Chris is interrupted with a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Edison (Perry King) and retreats to her bedroom.The interruption and Chris's apparent apathy toward his music enrages Stuart and he enters her bedroom smashing things and hitting her. He then throws her naked across her four poster bed and secures her spread-eagle on her stomach with silk scarves to the posts and sodomizes her.Toward the end of the rape Chris has stopped struggling so when little sister Kathy arrives home from school she enters the apartment and hears nothing amiss. She walks into Chris's bedroom via a connecting balcony and sees the scene, but does not realize that Chris is being forced against her will, so she leaves quietly, shutting the patio door behind her.Chris hears the patio door shut and realizes that Kathy must be home and begs Stuart to release her.

However, in the end it is Chris's own sister's testimony that gets Stuart off the hook: despite Kathy's protests that she believes her sister's story, it is clear that the afternoon of the attack Kathy's failure to call the police after seeing them together in the bedroom is a clear indication that she did not think at the time that her sister was being raped. The jury acquits Stuart.Chris tries to go back to work, but it is clear that she cannot focus her attention on her modeling and the lipstick company decides to suspend her contract. Kathy switches schools as it looks like Stuart may get his old job back.Kathy is watching her older sister at one final shoot being done at a partly completed mall complex and gets bored.

There we see him start to tear her clothes off....Kathy stumbles back to the part of the mall where the photo shoot is going on. She crying and her clothes are torn. Chris asks what happened. At first Kathy tells her nothing, but then admits she ran into Stuart and he attacked her.Chris races to the window and sees Stuart leaving the building. She runs down to her truck and gets a rifle she has in the back and shoots Stuart as he is driving from the parking lot. He crashes his car, then climbs out, but is shot again and again by Chris, including a shot to his genitals. She continues to try and pump bullets into his dead body even after he has stopped moving and the gun is empty. The police arrive and arrest Chris who is in a state of shock. As the camera pulls away from the scene we hear Bondi, who has apparently left the D.A's office to defend Chris, tell the jury during Chris' murder trial that justice can only be served if they acquit Chris of Stuart's murder."

It turns out the child is the son of Satan and can only be killed with the seven daggers of Meggado.—Humberto Amador Rome, Italy, June 6, 1966, 6:00 am. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American diplomat who hurries to a local hospital where his pregnant wife (Lee Remick) is going into labor. When he gets to the hospital, he is informed that his child was a stillbirth. A priest named Father Spiletto (Martin Benson) then offers him the choice to adopt a baby boy just born at the same time who has no parents. Thorn is reluctant to do so but knowing his wife will be devestated by the news of the death of her real child he agrees to the adoption.The boy is called Damien and moves to England with his mother and father when his father is appointed US ambassador to England. When Damien (Harvey Stephens) is celebrating his fifth birthday party, the family's nanny hangs herself in front of everyone and at the same time, the house is being watched by a rottweiler dog. In the background, a news photographer named Keith Jennings (David Warner) is present taking pictures.A few days later, a new nanny, named Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw) is sent to replace her but it is clear that she is not as she seems.Mrs. Baylock immediately challenges Kathy Thorn's authority when she is instructed to dress and ready Damien to attend a church wedding with them, but she does as she is told. As Thorn leaves the house, he is badgered by Jennings about circumstances around the previous nanny's death.The Thorns travel to the church one Sunday and Damien becomes more fearful as their car approaches the church. He has a violent reaction in which he injures his mother trying to get away. The car pulls away hurridly and while the Thorns discuss Damien's reaction and whether he should be examined by a doctor, they realize he has never been sick a day in his life.Later, in his office, Thorn is visited by a priest, named Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton), who claims to have been present during Damien's birth in Rome five years ago. He begs Thorn to accept Christ, because only then can he fight the son of the devil. The priest is escorted out by security and Jennings takes note of the visitor, snapping pictures. While developing the pictures of the day, Jennings notices the priest has a dark object like a javelin over his head in the pictures he appears in, but the anomaly doesn't appear anywhere else on the film.The next scene shows Kathy Thorn with Damien, traveling through a safari park, and various animals react with fear or anger towards Damien. It climaxes in a harrowing scene where a group of baboons attack the car that Kathy is driving forcing her to speed away.Meanwhile, Robert Thorn is followed by the priest that met with him earlier and is pulled aside at a public event; the priest tells him that his wife is in danger and he needs to talk to him. Jennings is also at the event, taking pictures. The pictures again show the dark anomaly above the priest.The next day, when Thorn meets with the priest again, Father Brennan again tells him that Damien is the son of the devil, born of a jackal, and will kill everyone around him and will kill his wife's unborn child as well as his wife. The priest instructs Thorn to go to Israel to the city of Megiddo to find a man who can tell him how to kill the son of the devil. Brennan tells Thron about an ancient prophecy that an antrichrist will be born, grow to manhood, and take over the world and lead it into death and destruction. Thorn thinks he is crazy and says never to bother him again. As the priest leaves the park, a sudden rainstorm comes up and the priest is impaled by a church spire in a freak accident while trying to get into a nearby church.Thorn goes home and his wife tells him she is pregnant. Startled by this news, he also receives a phone call telling him to examine the newspaper's cover story about the priest's bizarre death. Kathy has been agitated by Damien of late, causing her to visit a therapist, and tells Robert she wants to terminate the pregnancy. Disturbed by this, Thorn decides to go to the therapist to discuss Kathy's concerns. While Thorn is out, Damien's mother falls over a bannister after being knocked over by Damien, injuring her and thusly killing her unborn child.Jennings calls for Robert Thorn to meet him and he shows him the photographic anomalies with the old nanny and Father Brennan. Thorn tells him about the priest's warnings. Jennings said he is now involved because he found an anomaly on a picture of himself in which he has no neck. Jennings takes Thorn to the priest's residence, which he has access to due to the police investigation into his death, and they find an odd collection of crosses and Bible pages everywhere.Thorn and Jennings travel to Italy together to find the priest that gave him Damien at the hospital. They quickly learn that the hospital where Damien was born burned down in a mysterious fire five years ago, along with all the birth records. They go and find the priest, Father Spiletto, living in a remote monestery only to find him in very grave health. He is severly burned and has movement only in his left hand. Using a piece of charcoal, the priest points him in the direction of Damien's true mother.Thorn and Jennings travel to a local cemetery that lies in ruins, the former site of a shrine dedicated to the devil-god Techulca. They find the gravesites of both Damien's mother and the Thorns' baby... the mother's grave contains a jackal's remains, and the other grave contains a baby whose skull was crushed. Thorn realizes his baby was murdered (apparently by Spiletto and the Satanic conspirators) in order to swap its place with Damien. As they leave the cemetery, they are attacked by a pack of dogs led by a black rottweiler, and manage to escape.Robert calls his wife who is in hospital and tells her to come to Italy. However, she is thrown out of the hospital window by Mrs. Baylock as she gets up out of her bed.Back at the hotel, Thorn receives a phone call and finds out his wife has apparently jumped to her death from her hospital room. In his grief, he tells Jennings that he wants to go to Megiddo and that he wants Damien to die.Thorn and Jennings travel to Jerusalem and find that Megiddo is an archaelogic dig, almost completely underground. A man appears and takes them to Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern), the man the priest told Thorn to find. Bugenhagen is an elderly English archeologist who tells Thorn that he has been expecting him.

Coy ""Cannonball"" Buckman is a race driver-turned parolee, who signs on to compete in the Trans-Continental Road Race, a cross-country journey starting at the Santa Monica Pier and ending at a garage in New York City. This does not sit well with Coy's parole officer girlfriend Linda Maxwell, who is legally responsible for him and he could go back to prison for violating his parole. Fixing up Coy's red Pontiac Trans Am is his loyal pal Zippo Friedman, who decides to enter the race himself in a identical Trans Am and even dressing up like Coy to fool the cops.

Not long after, the dirty tricks begin to come into play: Bennie, with the help of his prison escapee friend Sharpe, secretly planted a bomb under Messer's Pantera, which explodes during a police pursuit in the desert and Redman shoots out a tire in Coy's Trans Am. He later beats up Sharpe, posing as a motorcycle cop pretending to stop Coy on a routine traffic stop, and confronts Redman at a roadside grocery store, where they wreck the entire establishment.

Coy shows up and learns from Linda that Zippo was actually driving the car that night when a young girl died, resulting in Coy's prosecution.

The Tenant,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074811/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bureaucrat rents a Paris apartment where he finds himself drawn into a rabbit hole of dangerous paranoia. In Paris, the shy bureaucrat Trelkovsky rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule, committed suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the tough landlord Mr. Zy establish stringent rules of behavior and Trelkovsky feels ridden by his neighbors. Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend Stella. After the death of Simone, Trelkovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Paris, isolated Eastern European émigré Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) rents an apartment in a spooky old building whose inhabitants regard him with suspicion and even outright hostility. When he learns that the apartment's previous tenant, a beautiful woman, tried to commit suicide by jumping out the window, Trelkovsky begins to identify with her in increasingly disturbing ways. Then, to make matters even worse, he reaches the conclusion that his new neighbors are plotting to kill him.—krmanirethnam Against the backdrop of the daunting housing shortage in 1970s Paris, and the suspicious suicide attempt of the young Egyptologist, Simone Choule, the mousy naturalised Frenchman, Trelkovsky, decides to try his luck at moving into the desperate woman's now-vacant flat. But, as the new renter does his best to comply with the draconian rules of the gloomy tenement building's landlord, Monsieur Zy, and learn to live with the spiteful neighbours' insidious intimidation, more and more, Trelkovsky finds himself enmeshed in a real, or perhaps, imagined web of conspiracy. Now, as Trelkovsky succumbs to the malevolent building's urban paranoia, hearing voices and seeing things, he becomes convinced that the building's other occupants are plotting to kill him. Are Trelkovsky's fears justified, or is the tenant starting to lose his fragile grip on reality?—Nick Riganas Trelkovsky, a Polish file clerk in Paris, moves into a new apartment in the city. The previous tenant, Simone Choule, lies in a coma in a hospital after jumping out of her window. Trelkovsky's new neighbors are an assortment of old recluses and busybodies. While visiting the ex-tenant in the hospital, Trelkovsky meets Stella, Simone's girlfriend. When Simone dies, Trelkovsky obsesses over her and seems doomed to repeat her final act.—alfiehitchie Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming Polish immigrant living in France, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the third-floor window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then suddenly dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways.As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends from the clerical office where he works, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and its tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him drinking at various bars around the city. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits like Simone and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.One evening, Trelkovsky has a run-in with Stella who is with some friends of hers at a local bar where they talk about the late Simone. After a gathering at friend's house, Stella invites Trelkovsky back to her apartment where she tries to seduce him. Trelkovsky is quite drunk and does not respond to her advances. He tells Stella about finding the human tooth in a wall in his apartment. He then tells a story about a man who lost his arm in an accident and wanted it buried. Trelkovsky instead passes out, leaving Stella to instead sleep beside him.The next day, Trelkovsky returns to his apartment where be becomes severely agitated and enraged when he sees that his apartment has been robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue to berate him for making too much noise... despite the fact that he appears to tiptoe around the apartment and watches his TV set without sound. He complains about the robbery to Zy, but the landlord is unsympathetic and refuses to allow Trelkovsky to call the police for he wants the building to remain quiet and respectable.Over the next several days, Trelkvosky becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends, slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates as he isolates himself from society. One evening, he imagines himself being attacked by a derelict in the hallway of the lobby in his apartment building while imagining it to be one of his neighbors Madame Dioz (Jo Van Fleet). He buys a wig and woman's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sits still in his apartment in the dead of night.He begins to suspect that Zy and neighbors had driven the previous tenant, Simone, to commit suicide by harassing her, and in his increasingly twisted state of mind, believes that they are trying to subtly change him into Simone so that he too will kill himself. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head in the apartment courtyard, and begins to see himself staring out of his own window and finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs.After a night of drinking at a local bar, Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over at her apartment and confides in her about his fear that his neighbors are trying to kill him, but she calmly tells him that it is all in his mind. The next morning, after Stella has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' conspiracy when a delivery man arrives outside her apartment with a packaged delivery. In his twisted mind, Trelkovsky looks through the peakhole of the front door and sees Zy there. After the delivery man leaves, Trelkvosky proceeds to wreak havoc in her apartment before departing, and steals her hidden supply of money.That evening, Trelkvosky is drinking at a local bar again when he makes the mistake of asking the barman where he can buy a gun. The barman and the manager throw him out of the bar from where the drunk Trelkvosky wanders into the street where he gets hit by a passing car driven by an elderly couple. The old man and woman stop and exit the car to check on him, and he is not wounded too seriously. An doctor appears and gives him a sedative injection due to his odd behavior. As a result, Trelkvosky perceives the elderly couple as landlord Zy and wife after which the couple return him to his apartment.By this point, a deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out the apartment window in the exact same manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors in the courtyard. The suicide attempt, in fact, wakes up his neighbors (whom Trelkovsky sees as humanoid monsters decending upon him). The neighbors arrive at the scene together with the police just in time for the wounded Trelkovsky to crawl up to his apartment and jump one more time.The end of the movie is enigmatic. Trelkovsky is bandaged up at the local hospital in the same fashion as Simone Choule in the very same hospital bed. When Trelkovsky looks up, two visitors come to visit him the next day. It happens to be Stella... and his own self standing before him in the exact same manner when Trelkvosky and Stella visited Simone in the hospital earlier. Trelkovsky then lets out the same disturbing scream that Simone had screamed. There is the possibility that this scene is not a flashback but that Trelkovsky is really Simone Choule and the whole supernatural cycle is about to start all over again."

There, Light announces the journey is over, but Tytyl says they cannot stop until they find the bluebird. Light tells them that the bluebird cannot be caged and must fly free. One by one, the elements return to their initial forms. Tylo begs to remain human so he can tell the children how much he loves them, but Light turns him back into a dog. Before Tylette transforms, Mytyl asks if she loves them, too, and Tylette replies that she loves them as much as they deserve. Light leads the children upstairs and tucks them into bed. When they beg Light not to leave, she explains they can always find her in the sunrise or in a lamp.As she vanishes, the children's mother wakes them and they hug her and tell her about their adventures.

Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth to get water for his dying planet. He starts a high technology company to get the billions of dollars he needs to build a return spacecraft, and meets Mary-Lou, a girl who falls in love with him. He does not count on the greed and ruthlessness of business here on Earth, however.—Gene Volovich <volovich@netcom.com> An alien, who adopts the name Thomas Jerome Newton, arrives on Earth and quickly sets about creating enough wealth to allow him to return to his own world. His home world is portrayed as a vast arid land where water is at a premium. With the help of patent lawyer Oliver Farnsworth - who later becomes the CEO of Newton's holding company, World Enterprises - he has a number of original patents that make him very rich. Along the way he meets a number of interesting characters, including Mary-Lou, who falls in love with him and Nathan Brice who works for him. The question of course is whether Newton will ever get to return home.—garykmcd A strange man, Thomas Newton, approaches a lawyer with some revolutionary formulae he wants patented. Within a short space of time his company is worth a fortune. Relocating to New Mexico and starting a relationship, everything seems to be going perfectly. But he harbours a deep secret, a secret regarding his true identity.—grantss Passing as human, an extraterrestrial calling himself Thomas Jerome Newton has just landed on Earth, specifically New Mexico, his mission to save his drought stricken planet by transporting water back from Earth. His first task is to amass the necessary exorbitant, by Earth standards, financial resources to design and build the transportation infrastructure to move the water. He is able to do so, using his advanced scientific knowledge and with the help of patent lawyer Oliver Farnsworth who will act as his front, by patenting basic technology, they forming a company called World Enterprises to market that technology to raise the money. One thing that Farnsworth cannot do is converse in that technological language, thus Thomas must act as that liaison directly with Dr. Nathan Bryce, who is hired to help design that transportation infrastructure, all the while Thomas not divulging exactly what he is designing. Regardless, Bryce, a former college professor, is able to redirect what was his restless energy which manifested itself in chasing after eighteen year old coeds into that work for Thomas. Through it all, Thomas meets and begins a turbulent relationship with hotel maid Mary-Lou, who acts as his connection to all things human. Trying to hide in plain sight may be difficult for Thomas under these circumstances as he comes under the scrutiny not only of business competitors but the authorities, some who may want to destroy Thomas both proverbially and literally.—Huggo A humanoid space alien (David Bowie) plummets to planet Earth, landing in a lake in New Mexico. He drinks the water from the lake and thinks about his barren planet, where his wife and two children are dying of thirst. Frequent flashbacks by the alien show of his dying planet.Using the name Thomas Jerome Newton, the alien travels to New York City to speak to lawyer Oliver Farnsworth (Buck Henry). Farnsworth is amazed that Newton has nine basic patents. He will be able to earn $300 million within three years, but Newton tells Farnsworth that he needs more money, not explaining why. He enlists Farnsworth's help to build a great corporation, named World Enterprises. Newton explains that with World Enterprises playing fairly, the corporation would make some other corporation obsolete.Nathan Bryce (Rip Torn), a divorced Chicago chemistry professor, spends his free time seducing his young female students. He becomes fascinated with World Color's self-developing film, which can be purchased very inexpensively (free cameras are thrown in). He wonders who the reclusive owner Newton is and begins making inquiries.Using the alias 'Mr. Sussex', Newton travels to New Mexico. He checks into a local hotel where he meets Mary-Lou (Candy Clark) a maid who helps him when he becomes sick from a fast elevator ride. She becomes his constant companion and lover. She brings him a TV set and influences him to drink alcoholic beverages, partially gin. Eventually, Newton watches many television sets at once having become addicted and begins to drink gin incessantly. Still missing his family, he initiates a space program with all the money he has made in order to return to his home planet and to bring water to help his wife and children.Meanwhile, Farnsworth hires Bryce to come to New Mexico and work on the secret project space program that World Enterprises is funding. Bryce sets up his residence in a small cabin on the other side of the lake from Newton and Mary-Lou. He secretly takes X-rays of Newton and discovers that Newton's form is totally alien. Newton, who can see X-rays, confides in Bryce that he really is an alien. He says he has no intention of causing harm to Earthlings and only wants to help his dying world by sending some of Earth's water back to his planet for it to survive.Over the next year or so, the space project is taking too long. All Newton begins to do to drink and watch television. It is revealed that he has watched American TV for years on his home planet, but never guessed that it revealed nothing about the human condition. As he becomes more human, he feels his life and mission is futile.Newton's relationship with Mary-Lou begins to deteriorate when she demands more attention. He strips off his earthling guise, and she is terrified by his alien form. She can't make love to him anymore, although she continues to admit that she does love him. When Farnsworth bribes Mary-Lou to get away from Newton, she turns him down for she doesn't want money, she only wants ""Tommy"" as he is.Capitalist companies pressure Farnsworth to sell World Enterprises, but Farnsworth refuses. A little later, Farnsworth and his gay lover Trevor (Rick RIccardo) are killed when corporate hit-men throw them both from the window of Farnsworth's New York apartment.Newton completes the spaceship and attempts to take it on its maiden voyage amid intense press exposure. However, just before his scheduled take-off, he is seized and detained. The US government, which has apparently been told by Bryce that Newton is an alien, holds him captive in a locked luxury apartment, constructed deep within a hotel. During his stay, they keep him sedated with alcohol (to which he has become addicted) and continuously subject him to rigorous medical tests - notably one involving X-rays which causes the contact lenses he wears as part of his human disguise to permanently affix themselves to his eyes. Within that time, World Enterprises goes bankrupt. Bryce begins to work for Peters (Bernie Casey) the government agent who masterminded Newton's kidnapping.Toward the end of his years of captivity, he is visited again by Mary-Lou, who is now much older and whose looks have been ravaged by alcohol and time. They have mock-violent, playful sex that involves firing a gun with blanks, and afterwards occupy their time drinking and playing table tennis. Mary-Lou declares that she no longer loves him, while he says that he doesn't love her either. She leaves him. Eventually Newton discovers that his ""prison,"" now derelict, is unlocked, and he leaves.Unable to return home to his planet, a broken and alcoholic Newton creates an album recording with alien messages, titled 'The Visitor', which he hopes will be broadcast via radio to his home planet (which his wife and the entire population may have already died from thirst). Bryce, who has since married Mary-Lou, buys a copy of the album and meets Newton at an outside restaurant in town. Newton is still rich and young looking despite the passage of many years. However, Newton has also fallen into depression and alcoholism and the film ends with an inebriated Newton passing out in his cafe chair."

Midway,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074899/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatization of the battle that was widely heralded as a turning point of the Pacific Theatre of World War II. May 1941. After the Doolittle Raid Japan aims to expand its territory in the Pacific, to make such raids less likely. Their next target: Midway Island. However, the US Navy is intercepting their messages and has partially cracked their encryption code, forewarning them of Japan's intentions. Two US aircraft carrier task groups are sent to Midway, resulting in the one of the most important battles in history.—grantss The summer of 1942 brought Naval stalemate to the Pacific as the American and Japanese fleets stood at even numbers each waiting for the other to begin a renewed offensive. ""Midway"" tells the story of this historic June battle where a Japanese carrier force, in an attempt to occupy Midway island and lure the American fleet to destruction, was meet valiently by US forces operating off of three aircraft carriers and numerous escort ships. It was the first battle in which naval air power was extensivly used, and at its conclusion the Japanese Carrier force had been completly destroyed which lead the way for the US 1943 and 44 offensives which would eventually bring the Pacific War to a close.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> The Battle of Midway is done with captions to identify historical characters. Historically accurate in its major points, a subplot of an American flyer who is engaged to a Hawaiian girl of Japanese descent has been added. This is the battle in which the previously undefeated Japanese fleet was stopped in a battle during which all damage was done by aircraft. The opposing fleets never saw each other.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The 1942 battles of the Coral Sea and Midway island are retold through the points of view of both sides. When an audacious US air raid reaches Japan itself, Combined Fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto orders seaborne invasions of Port Moresby in the southwestern Pacific and of Midway Island near Hawaii, invasions that Yamamoto hopes will smoke out the US Pacific Fleet for destruction before the full might of US war production can kick in. The Japanese are supremely confident of victory over the vastly outnumbered US fleet, but they are unaware that US Navy intelligence has cracked the Imperial Navy's codes, allowing the US to deploy aircraft carriers to maximum counteroffensive effect.—Michael Daly Six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Navy still has not fully recovered from the losses it suffered. In April of 1942 the US staged a desperate stopgap measure to bring pressure on Japan by launching Army bombers under the command of James Doolittle from the USS Hornet to bomb Tokyo and other cities. While the raid achieved relatively little in terms of damage, it has sent a wave of panic among Japanese leadership, and the commander of the Combined Fleet, Isoroku Yamamoto, sees it as opportunity to implement a planned attack on the island of Midway, near the Hawaiian Islands, a plan designed to bring out what is left of the US Pacific Fleet and finish it off before American industry (which has long scared Yamamoto given its greater strength over Japan's) can fully commit to rebuilding American strength. The proposed operation encounters resistance from Admiral Nobutake Kondo, who doesn't believe Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo can survive another attack by the First Air Fleet's carriers against a target certain to bring out land-based bombers.While the command corps of the Imperial Navy debates Yamamoto's plan, US Navy Captain Matthew Garth, a go-between for the Navy's Pacific command - aka CINCPAC - is consulting Navy intelligence chief Captain Joseph Rochefort, who spends his full time in a dank underground chamber decoding Japanese radio traffic with a staff of assistants. Rochefort has been getting some traffic about an area of interest to the Japanese known only as Objective AF.Garth, meanwhile, has a more personal issue to deal with, as his son, a Navy pilot, has fallen in love with a Japanese girl on Oahu, at the worst possible time given the wholesale internment of Japanese on American soil.Rochefort's codebreaking allows the Pacific Fleet to learn of a Japanese invasion force heading for Port Moresby. Two of the Fleet's four available carrier groups - the USS Lexington and Yorktown - are dispatched to the Coral Sea, where they engage two of the First Air Fleet's carriers, Division Five, the Shokaku and Zuikaku, and a smaller carrier. The Lexington is attacked by some two hundred Japanese planes and sunk, while the smaller Japanese carrier is sunk and some damage is wrought to the rest of Division Five. The Yorktown is also heavily damaged and some 100 US aircraft are lost.After the Yorktown returns to Pearl for repairs - a three-month job compressed to three days via 1,200 technicians working around the clock - Captain Garth and Joe Rochefort meet Admiral Chester Nimitz with after-action reports from Coral Sea. It is here that Rochefort broaches a theory that Objective AF in Japanese code traffic may be the Island of Midway, near Hawaii; Rochefort asks that a dummy message about a shortage of fresh water be sent from Midway in the clear. Deciding no harm can come of it, Nimitz has his aide LTC Earnest Blake have the message sent.Days later a transmission from the Japanese warbase on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands is intercepted by Pearl and it confirms that AF is indeed Midway. Garth awakens Nimitz with the news.Meanwhile Yamamoto has laid out his plan - a Northern force is to invade several Aleutian Islands to draw US attention from Midway, where the First Air Fleet - now down to four carriers, the Akagi, Kaga, Soru, and Hiryu - will attack Midway; Admiral Kondo's invasion fleet will then occupy the island and the US will have no choice but to counterattack with their remaining carriers, under the presumed command of aggressive Admiral William F. Halsey. There is no concern for the understrength nature of the First Air Fleet given that Division Five was considered the weakest unit of the Imperial Navy's carrier force. Admiral Nagumo, though, does have some misgivings that the plan depends on the US reacting as expected.Nimitz meanwhile gets bad news - Halsey has been hospitalized and will not be available to defend Midway, so he hands command to one of his cruiser commanders, Raymond Spruance. Atop this, Nimitz has to deal with Vinton Maddox, a ""scalp-hunter"" from Washington who believes the Japanese are feeding radio traffic to deceive Hawaii into being outmaneuvered by a Japanese strike at Hawaii itself or even California.Captain Garth is assigned to the USS Yorktown, now operational despite Coral Sea damage, under Admiral Frank J. Fletcher, while Admiral Spruance commands the carriers Enterprise and Hornet. Also assigned to the Enterprise's air group is Matt's son, Tom, angry that his father tried to intervene on behalf of his girlfriend.In early June long range reconnaisance seaplanes spot the two Japanese armadas, and as expected Nagumo's air fleet attacks Midway, slaughtering the island's small group of fighters and strafing and bombing the area. Nagumo, though, has ordered scout planes to probe the area he expects American sea forces to be - northeast of Midway, as they indeed are. But a scout plane is late getting launched, a fateful delay when the Midway attack commences and returning aircraft arrive to the fleet almost out of fuel and some sustaining damage - just as the tardy scout plane picks up the US fleet and Nagumo's assistant Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi recommends an immediate attack on the US force even with aircraft not properly armed for anti-ship action.The Midway attack has brought out the air armadas of the three US carriers, but attack by torpedo planes is intercepted by Japanese fighters; Group Eight from the USS Hornet is massacred and only Ensign George Gay survives, while Group's Six and Three achieve no success either; Tom Garth and other fighter pilots do succeed in shooting down several enemy fighters but Tom's plane is pierced by fire and the cockpit blows up in flame, severely injuring Tom.Amid the martyrdom of the Torpedo Groups, Raymond Massey and Max Leslie of the Enterprise and Yorktown's dive bomber squadrons reach the enemy force just as Nagumo has begun to launch his planned attack on the US fleet; caught completely by surprise, the Japanese carriers are pummeled by dive bombers and their flight decks, stacked with launching aircraft and bombs carelessly stacked aside, are ripped to shreds. Within a minute or so, the Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu are shredded and left in flame, with only Tamon Yamaguchi and the Hiryu left to attack the USS Yorktown."
Network,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A television network cynically exploits a deranged former anchor's ravings and revelations about the news media for its own profit, but finds that his message may be difficult to control. In the 1970s, terrorist violence is the stuff of networks' nightly news programming and the corporate structure of the UBS Television Network is changing. Meanwhile, Howard Beale, the aging UBS news anchor, has lost his once strong ratings share and so the network fires him. Beale reacts in an unexpected way. We then see how this affects the fortunes of Beale, his coworkers (Max Schumacher and Diana Christensen), and the network.—Bruce Janson <bruce@cs.su.oz.au> The Union Broadcasting System (UBS) is the floundering fourth place American network of only four. Howard Beale, the once popular news anchor for UBS, has seen his own declining fortunes of late. Personal problems have led to his performance slipping, which in turn has led to declining ratings. The network has fired him, effective in two weeks, the news given to him by the head of the network's news division and his long time friend, Max Schumacher. On his first broadcast following receiving this news, Beale announces on air that he will blow out his brains on the telecast in one week's time, and the reason for doing so. The network brass, incensed, pulls him off effective immediately, but Howard, stating he was drunk at the time over the news of his firing, pleads for one final telecast so that he can exit from news broadcasting with dignity. When on the broadcast Howard instead speaks candidly, emotionally and profanely about what he is feeling, Diana Christensen, the relatively new and ambitious vice-president in charge of programming, thinks that Howard is the panacea to all the network's rating problems as Howard is only stating what the public is feeling. She is interested in counter-establishment programming. With Max's blessing, she wants to hijack from the news division a television news show featuring Howard. Through this process, Diana tries to convince network brass to do what she wants not only with Howard's show but other counter-establishment programming, Max wants to preserve his reputation as a news man with integrity, and Howard tries to convince Max and Diana that he is imbued with messages from higher powers, which is making him seem insane to Max (who cares) and Diana (who cares only if his rantings from these higher powers increase ratings). Despite their differences in views, Max and Diana begin a September-May romance, which plays on Max's conscience as a faithful married man for twenty-five years and which Diana always refers to, as she does everything in life, in terms of a television show plot outline.—Huggo In this lauded satire, veteran news anchorman Howard Beale discovers that he's being put out to pasture, and he's none too happy about it. After threatening to shoot himself on live television, instead he launches into an angry televised rant, which turns out to be a huge ratings boost for the UBS network. This stunt allows ambitious producer Diana Christensen to develop even more outrageous programming, a concept that she takes to unsettling extremes.—Jwelch5742 Howard Beale is an aging TV anchorman for UBS who is fired, effective in two weeks, after his ratings have been steadily deteriorating. He reacts to this by sensationally announcing on live television his intention to commit suicide on air. In doing so, Beale becomes a major TV icon and one of the most valuable assets to the Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the company that is gradually taking control of UBS. As a result he is given his own show as 'the mad prophet of the air-waves'. He appears live on television every week-day evening to tell the real truth to the people of America. The program is a huge success but Beale uses his power to make startling revelations about CCA, leaving the company executives with a serious problem.—David Claydon <dc6212@bristol.ac.uk> The following synopsis has mostly been taken from the film's Wikipedia page:Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the longtime anchor of the Union Broadcasting System's UBS Evening News, learns from the news division president, Max Schumacher (William Holden), that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The two old friends get roaring drunk and lament the state of their industry. The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast. UBS tries to fire him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant claiming that life is ""bullshit"". Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading his viewers to shout out of their windows ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!""Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) heads the network's programming department; seeking just one hit show, she cuts a deal with a band of radical terrorists (a parody of the Symbionese Liberation Army called the ""Ecumenical Liberation Army"") for a new docudrama series called the Mao Tse-Tung Hour for the upcoming fall season. When Beale's ratings seem to have topped out, Christensen approaches Schumacher and offers to help him ""develop"" the news show. He says no to the professional offer, but not to the personal one; the two begin an affair. When Schumacher decides to end Beale's ""angry man"" format, Christensen convinces her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett agrees, bullies the UBS executives to consent, and fires Schumacher at the same time. Soon afterward, Beale is hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show, top-billed as ""the mad prophet of the airwaves"". The show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants Beale's signature catchphrase en masse: ""We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!"" At first, Max and Diana's romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together, and Schumacher leaves his wife of over 25 years for Christensen. But Christensen's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Max back to his wife, and he warns his former lover that she will self-destruct at the pace she is running with her career. ""You're television incarnate, Diana"", he tells her, ""indifferent to suffering, insensitive to joy. All of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality.""When Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the conglomerate that owns UBS, will be bought out by an even larger Saudi Arabian conglomerate, he launches an on-screen tirade against the deal, encouraging viewers to send telegrams to the White House telling them ""I want the CCA deal stopped now!"" This throws the top network brass into a state of panic because the company's debt load has made merger essential for survival. Hackett takes Beale to meet with CCA chairman Arthur Jensen, who explicates his own ""corporate cosmology"" to the attentive Beale. Jensen delivers a tirade of his own in an ""appropriate setting"", the dramatically darkened CCA boardroom, that suggests to the docile Beale that Jensen may himself be some higher power describing the inter-relatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen persuades Beale to abandon the populist messages and preach his new ""evangel"". But television audiences find his new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing, and ratings begin to slide, yet Jensen will not allow UBS executives to fire Beale. Seeing the two-for-the-price-of-one value of solving the Beale problem plus sparking a boost in season-opener ratings, Christensen, Hackett, and the other executives decide to hire the Ecumenical Liberation Army to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to The Howard Beale Show and kicking off a second season of The Mao Tse-Tung Hour.The film ends with the narrator stating:""This was the story of Howard Beale, the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings."""
To the Devil a Daughter,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075334/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American occult novelist battles to save the soul of a young girl from a group of Satanists, led by an excommunicated priest, who plan on using her as the representative of the Devil on Earth. An excommunicated priest sets up a satanic cult that only looks Catholic on the outside. He convinces a man to sign over his daughter's soul so that she will become the devil's representative on earth on her eighteenth birthday, but as that day nears, the man seeks the help of an American occult novelist to save his daughter, both physically and spiritually.—Brian J. Wright <tyrannorabbit@hotmail.com> Father Michael (Christopher Lee) is excommunicated from the church for heresy, although he does not recant.20 years later in Bavaria, Father Michael collects a nun Catherine (Nastassja Kinski) from a nunnery and hands her to George (Michael Goodliffe) and Eveline (Eva Maria Meineke) who take her to the airport for a flight to London. George and Eveline then go to their hospital and greet a pregnant woman Margaret (Isabella Telezynska).In London, John Verney (Richard Widmark) is launching his latest book about the occult at an art exhibition. Present at the launch are lovers Anna Fountain (Honor Blackman) and David Kennedy (Anthony Valentine). Henry Beddows (Denholm Elliot) arrives insisting he speak to Verney, and during their lengthy conversation he hands Verney an envelope in which there is a picture of his daughter Catherine. Verney heads to Heathrow airport to collect her. At Heathrow, Catherine's companion Kollde (Constantin de Goguel) telephones Henry but Henry does not answer; instead he is loading a gun while the phone rings. Verney collects Catherine behind Kollde's back and takes her to his home in London.Later Catherine talks to her father on the telephone. While she does Kollde arrives at Henry's house with a gun. After a short scuffle, Henry shoots and kills Kollde.Father Michael arrives at George and Eveline's hospital where Margaret is in labour. She is tended to by the three of them but she is tied to the bed and her legs bound together.Anna and David telephone Verney to ask about the woman he collected from the airport. They arrange to meet at Verney's home the following morning.While Margaret is in labour in Bavaria, Catherine suffers similar pains in bed in London. After Margaret's baby is born, Father Michael and George put Margaret to death with a lethal injection. Father Michael, George and Eveline bring the new born baby to England.
Anna and David arrive at Verney's house. Verney explains that Satanists are after Catherine and her father Henry is trying to protect her and trusted her to Verney since he is an occult expert.Meanwhile Father Michael explains to George and Eveline that it is too late for Henry because he took a pact 18 years earlier. Father Michael telephones Henry and as they talk, Father Michael wraps a cord around the telephone. At the other end, Henry sees a snake around his wrist and in his horror reveals Catherine is at Verney's home.In a flashback to 18 years ago, Henry secretly witnesses Catherine's birth in a church in a Satanist ritual conducted by Father Michael. During the birth his wife and Catherine's mother Isabel (Anna Bentinck) dies. Henry's hiding place is revealed and he is forced to take a pact: a satanic pendant.Father Michael, George and Eveline conduct another satanic ritual which has the power to make Catherine put on a satanic pendant and leave Verney's home. Verney arrives back just in time to see Catherine leaving and stop her, ripping off the pendant. Catherine explains she had a vivid dream in which she was part of a satanic ritual. Catherine becomes more and more hysterical until Verney slaps her and knocks her out.Father Michael telephones Verney to tell him Henry is in hospital to try and get Catherine back but Verney refuses. Verney visits a bishop at St. Paul's cathedral who explains that Father Michael was excommunicated because he wanted to create a personification of a god but it was actually the personification of the devil called Astaroth. Verney checks the pages Father Michael has read in a book about Astaroth in the cathedral's vaults.Meanwhile, while David tries to locate Henry, Father Michael uses his power to make Catherine stab Anna and flee Verney's home. She is found on the streets by George and taken to Father Michael and the new born baby. Eveline starts donating her blood to be used in the baptism.
When Verney arrives home, David insists they go and look for Catherine together. Verney and David search Henry's home and find the body of Kollde. Continuing the search, they find Henry weeping and hysterical in a chair. Verney explains they are planning to baptise Catherine and she will become Astaroth. They want Henry to tell them where Catherine has been taken but he won't without the pact. As they drive away, Verney explains to David that the Satanists baptise a child in the blood of her dead mother, bring her up in seclusion as a nun, then baptise her again with blood as the devil.Verney and David arrive at a church where they see a vision of Catherine's mother on the altar. Verney searches the altar for the pact but as he finds it, David grabs it. David is immediately consumed in fire and dies in a pile of ash.Eveline dies providing all her blood for the baptism of Catherine.Verney returns the pact to Henry, who then reveals where Father Michael will have taken Catherine.Father Michael has placed Catherine on an altar and surrounded her with a circle of blood. Verney arrives to see Father Michael sacrifice the baby. He overpowers George with a flint stone which causes Father Michael to pause the baptism. Verney explains that the demons are angry with Michael, although Michael thinks he is safe because of what he read in the book of Astaroth. However, Verney has the flint with the blood of George, one of Michael's disciples, on it which will actually protect Verney. He steps inside the circle of blood surrounding Catherine, throws the flint at Michael knocking him to the ground, and carries Catherine out of the circle. When he looks back, Michael and the circle of blood have disappeared."
Assault on Precinct 13,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074156/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Highway Patrol Officer, two criminals and a station secretary defend a defunct Los Angeles precinct office against a siege by a bloodthirsty street gang. Police ambush and kill several gang members in Los Angeles. Gang members make a pact of blood to strike back at police, and conduct a siege on the police station which is almost abandoned and due to be closed. Staff of the closing precinct and the criminals being held there while in transit must work together to fight off the attacking gang members.—Scott McKenna <smckenna@lcb.state.nv.us> In Los Angeles, the street gangs unite and declare war to the police. Meanwhile, a father stops his car in a suburb and his daughter goes to an ice-cream truck to buy a vanilla ice-cream. She is murdered in cold blood by a member of one gang. The father follows the guy, kills him with many shots and runs to the Precinct 13. The policeman Bishop has just assumed the police station, which is not in operation but waiting to be closed on the next morning. With him, there are two women: the telephone operator and Leigh. A few moments before the arrival of the shocked father, a bus transporting three prisoners had stopped there and the escort policemen requested cells to lock the prisoners while waiting for a doctor for one of them that is ill. Suddenly the precinct is under siege and violent attack of street gangs.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An L.A. street gang declares war on a police station about to be shut down that has given refuge to a man who has witnessed a gang slaying. Because of the shutdown, the phones and electricity have been turned off, and gang members await outside with knives and guns where the precinct has been totally shut off from the outside world.—Humberto Amador The story takes place on a Saturday day and night in Anderson, a crime-infested ghetto in South Central Los Angeles. Members of a local gang, called 'Street Thunder', have recently stolen a large number of automatic rifles and pistols. At 3:10 am, a team of heavily armed LAPD officers ambush and kill six members of the gang. In the morning, the gang's four warlords swear a blood oath of revenge, known as a ""Cholo"", against the police and the citizens of Los Angeles. Each man cuts his arm and bleeds in a glass bowl.That afternoon, CHIP Officer Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) goes out for a drive. Over his CB radio, he is disappointed to learn that his first night as a CHP police lieutenant will be spent supervising the decommissioning of the Anderson precinct, aka Precinct 13.At 5:11 p.m., special agent Starker (Charles Cyphers) arrives at the Los Cruces prison to transport three prisoners to the state prison in Sonora, California. The warden (John J. Fox) introduces him to the convicts: Wells (Tony Burton), a muscular African-American man; Cornell (Peter Frankland), an ill and skinny white man; and Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), a violent, psychotic death row inmate, shackled to a chair in his jail cell. The warden knocks Wilson off the chair without provocation, then leads him outside where Wilson wraps his chains around the Warden's legs and pulls him off his feet, forcing the Starker and the guards to restrain Wilson in gunpoint.Meanwhile, Lawson (Martin West) and his young daughter, Kathy (Kim Richards), drive by the Anderson precinct looking for Kathy's nanny's house. They pass the gang four leaders, who screw silencers onto their automatic weapons and go out looking for people to kill.Later, Bishop arrives at Anderson and meets his skeleton crew: Julie (Nancy Loomis), a switchboard operator; Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), a secretary; and Chaney (Henry Brandon), an elderly police sergeant. Bishop is briefed by the departing police captain that only two shotguns are left in the precinct and he will be relieved at 4 a.m.; the precinct will close at 10 a.m.Meanwhile, on the prison bus, Cornell has a coughing fit so bad that Starker orders the driver to go to the nearest police precinct.At 6:18 p.m., Lawson stops at a phone booth to phone for directions, while Kathy runs over to an ice cream truck. The ice cream driver (Peter Bruni) is distracted by a black car that keeps circling the block. After Kathy skips away with her ice cream, the driver is pulled out of the truck by the white gang leader (Frank Doubleday). Realizing she got the wrong flavor, Kathy comes back to the truck and is shot by the gang leader, who then fatally shoots the driver. Lawson finishes his call and sees Kathy lying by the truck. Cradling Kathy's body, Lawson sees the black car drive away and the driver lives long enough to tell him that the gun is in a holder next to the steering wheel. Lawson grabs it, gets into his car and chases after the gang.Meanwhile, the police bus arrives at Anderson, and a reluctant Bishop allows Starker to use the holding cells, while he calls a doctor.At 7:00 p.m., Lawson chases Kathy's killers into a field until they jump out of their car and run. Lawson kills the white gang leader, then realizes he is out of bullets, and runs to Anderson precinct. Collapsing at the front desk, Lawson is so traumatized that he can only say he is being followed. Ethan Bishop puts Lawson into the Captain's office and tries to call a doctor, but the phones and the lights suddenly go dead. Bishop at first believes it is an outside power failure, but the streetlights remain on. Starker decides to leave; however, when Chaney and Bishop step outside, Chaney is shot dead. Bishop runs back inside, and rushes to the holding cells, but is too late to prevent Starker, the two prison guards and Cornell from being gunned down as they step outside. Napoleon Wilson steals Starker's keys, but Bishop makes Starker give them to him after he gets Wilson and Wells back inside and into the holding cells.Salvos of bullets greet Bishop as he returns to the lobby. When the firing stops, he looks outside and sees everyone is gone. Leigh explains there is no rear exit to the building, and all the surrounding buildings are abandoned. As Bishop gives her his revolver and orders her to watch the windows, the gang's three remaining leaders appear throw the glass bowl of blood at the door and then lay a white sheet with the Street Thunder emblem on the front in front of the building before walking away. Sobbing, Julie pleads with Bishop to give the gang Lawson, but he refuses.The shooting resumes, and Bishop hands Leigh the cell keys, ordering her to free the prisoners. As she opens the cells, a thug breaks down the outside door and shoots her in her right arm. She smashes the man in the face with the key ring and opens the cell. She releases Wells and Wilson. Now unchained, Wilson dispatches another gang member who tries to stab him, and helps Leigh fights her way back to the lobby and barricades the door.During the assault, gang members smash through the windows. Bishop dons a rifle while he tosses Wilson a pump-action shotgun while Wells retrieves a gun from a slain gang member. Together, Bishop, Wilson, Wells and Leigh kill or wound more then a dozen gang members attempting to force their way into the building through the windows until they withdraw. When the fighting is over, they discover Julie is dead. Bishop notices an acetylene tank and exclaims that they could have been blown to pieces.Looking outside, Bishop sees that all the corpses have been removed to make it seem like nothing has happened. When Wells informs them he is leaving, Bishop stands in his way and Wells pulls his gun. Leigh steps between them, telling Wells he will be gunned down if he goes outside, then notices Wells is out of bullets. A quick check shows they have only eight bullets left (three in Bishop's rifle, three in Wilson's shotgun and two in Leigh's pistol).At 8:18 pm, remembering that a tunnel runs from the basement to a manhole in the parking lot, Leigh explains someone could crawl out, and go for help. The two prisoners play a game to decide who goes out and Wells loses. He crawls out, hot-wires a car and drives off. When Wells stops at a phone booth, a gang member sits up in the back seat and shoots him in the head.Out of options, Wilson recommends they retreat to the basement as it is easier to defend when they see the gang members in the distance gathering for a final assault. As they descend the stairs, carrying the still-comatose Lawson with them, Leigh asks Wilson why he did not try to escape and Wilson replies that there are only two things a man never leaves behind, one is a helpless man, but he does not say what the second is.Bishop decides to make a final stand in the basement hallway; he wraps some flares around the acetylene tank, explaining that when the gang attacks, he will shoot the flares to detonate the tank. He and Wilson will use a huge metal sign to shield them from the blast.Meanwhile, two policemen patrolling the neighborhood call for backup when they find a dead telephone repairman hanging from a pole.Back at Precinct 13, the gang attacks by throwing Molotov cocktails through the windows and finally break into the building and eventually head down into the basement, but Wilson and Bishop use clubs to force them back. Leigh shoots a gang member coming in from the sewer entrance. When the hall is full, Bishop shoots the tank with his final bullet and it explodes.Outside the burning police station, when more police officers arrive and secure the station, the surviving gang members retreat. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of dead and badly burned gang members strewn in the hallway, and the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and the comatose Lawson. When a policeman tries to handcuff Wilson, Ethan Bishop pushes him away and says it will be a privilege if Wilson will walk out with him. The two leave the smoking basement."
1900,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074084/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The epic tale of a class struggle in twentieth-century Italy as seen through the eyes of two childhood friends on opposing sides. Set in Italy, the film follows the lives and interactions of two boys/men, one born a bastard of peasant stock, Olmo, the other born to a land owner, Alfredo. The drama spans from 1900 to about 1945, and focuses mainly on the rise of Fascism and the peasants' eventual reaction by supporting Communism, and how these events shape the destinies of the two main characters.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Epic, episodic movie following the lives of two Italian men, a poor peasant and a wealthy landowner, spanning over 40 years detailing their personal conflicts with each other as friends, then enemies, and friends again amid the social upheaval in Italy during the first years of the 20th century.—Anonymous Rural Italy, early 1900s. Two boys, Alfredo and Olmo, are born on the same day - one to the owner of a large estate, the other to one of his labourers. There is a massive divide between the classes in Italy, to the point of antagonism. Despite this, and despite some disagreements along the way, Alfredo and Olmo become best friends. We see them grow up, go to WW1 and their adult lives. Eventually their different upbringings and social standings come back to haunt them, as Italy is plunged into class war - the Socialists (workers) vs the Fascists (supported by the middle- and upper-class). Alfredo and Olmo find themselves on opposite sides.—grantss The film opens on April 25, 1945, the day Italy is liberated from the fascists. The peasants on an estate in Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy are shown attempting to join the partisans and place the owner of the estate, Alfredo Berlinghieri, under arrest. A balding, middle-aged man named Attila and woman named Regina are seen attempting to flee the farm but are attacked by women laborers wielding pitchforks. The narrative moves back to the start of the century.....On January 27, 1901 (the day of the death of renowned composer Giuseppe Verdi), two babies are born on the estate within minutes apart from each other. They are Alfredo Berlinghieri and Olmo Dalcò who come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alfredo is from a family of wealthy landowners led by his abusive but popular grandfather Alfredo the Elder (Burt Lancaster), while Olmo is an illegitimate peasant son of an unmarried teenage peasant girl living off the estate whose grandfather Leo Dalcò (Sterling Hayden) is the foreman and peasant strong man who verbally and spiritually carries a duel of wits with both the peasants as well as his employer, but without ever reaching violence with Elder Alfredo's bidding. While growing up, the young Alfredo (Paolo Pavesi as a child) is somewhat rebellious and despises the falseness of his family, in particular his weak but cynical father Giovanni. Alfredo meets and befriends Olmo (Roberto Maccanti as a child), who is being raised as a socialist. During this time, Leo leads labor strikes against the unfair working conditions on the farm.The two become friends throughout their childhood, despite the social differences of their families. When Alfredo is around age 10, his grandfather, suffering from gout, dementia, and other ailments, commits suicide by hanging himself in the dairy barn. As a result, Alfredo the Younger's father, Giovanni, inherits the plantation.In the mid 1910s, Olmo leaves the plantation and joins a socialist youth movement and later enlists with the Italian army during World War I and goes off to fight on the front lines in northern Italy while Alfredo stays behind to learn how to run his family's large plantation.In 1919, Olmo (Gérard Depardieu as an adult) returns after the war ends and has a warm reunion with Alfredo (Robert De Niro as an adult) and their friendship resumes. However during Olmo's time away, Alfredo's father has hired Attila Mellanchini (Donald Sutherland) as his new foreman following the death of Olmo's own grandfather, Leo a few years earlier. Attila is sadistic man who becomes taken with fascism, especially after the fascists come to power in 1922.Attila eventually incorporates his new belief system in his dealings with the Berlinghieri workers; he treats them cruelly and later cages them in the Berlinghieri compound and accuses them of treason against Fascist Italy. Several are killed by Attila himself. Alfredo's father, Giovanni, eventually dies from an illness and Alfredo inherits the vast estate as its sole heir. As the new padrone (master) of the plantation, Alfredo does little to challenge or halt Attila's evil actions.During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the intimacy and lack thereof in their respective relationships with others is highlighted in their love lives as both Alfredo and Olmo cannot seem to hook up with the right woman to be with. In one encounter, Alfredo and Olmo attempt to have a threesome with a local prostitute only to have her go into an epileptic fit which stops the threesome sexual encounter before it begins.In 1930, Alfredo marries a gorgeous, demure Frenchwoman, named Ada (Dominique Sanda), while Olmo marries Anita (Stefania Sandrelli), a fellow left-wing idealist who, like him, shares in the enthusiasm of the cause of workers' rights in the vein of socialism. Ada, however, sinks into alcoholism when confronted with the reality of the emptiness of her relationship with Alfredo.Anita dies tragically in childbirth, bringing another member into the community; a daughter whom Olmo names after his late wife. As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes with Attila several times as the years go on. Olmo's daughter, Anita the Younger (Anna Henkel-Grönemeyer), grows into a young and resourceful teenager whom is supportive of her father's socialist beliefs.As Olmo takes on his fateful role of leader among the poor farmers and their families, he clashes several times with Attila. The latter, whose psychopathic tendencies have been revealed via the murders of a cat and a small boy (the latter at Alfredo and Ada's wedding and for which Olmo is initially blamed), commits further atrocities. However, he becomes a fresh target of ridicule at the hands of the peasants; led by Olmo, they take turns throwing manure at him after Attila tries to sell Olmo like a slave. Olmo flees to keep from being killed by the fascists, and Attila reacts to the humiliation by tearing up Olmo's house with his black-shirts before caging the peasants on the Berlinghieri compound and indiscriminately shooting them. Alfredo fires Attila, but discovers that Ada has already left him.The film comes full circle when on April 25, 1945 as the padrone, Alfredo is captured by a teenage peasant boy carrying a rifle. Attila is also captured when he and his wife, the equally cruel and sadistic Regina (Laura Betti), try to flee the region. Attila is stabbed (non-fatally) several times by women wielding pitchforks and is imprisoned in the Berlinghieri pig sty. He is later executed by the peasants (while they cut off most of Regina's hair), who have discovered that Attila had raped and killed a young boy (ironically, the son of one of the most fervent supporters of fascism as an antidote to socialism) several years prior in a fit of rage and had also murdered a wealthy landowner's widow, Mrs. Pioppi (Alida Valli), during the winter of 1939 whose husband had been economically ruined by Alfredo, in order to steal her land and home.Alfredo is brought before Olmo's workers tribunal to stand trial. Many workers come forth and accuse Alfredo of letting them suffer in squalor while he (and his social class) profited from their labors and on top of that, he did nothing to stop the sadistic Attila. Alfredo is sentenced to death, but his execution is prevented after Olmo explains that the padrone is already dead even though Alfredo lives... that is, the social system has been overthrown with the end of the war. As soon as the verdict is overturned, however, representatives of the new government, which includes the Communist Party, arrive and call on the peasants to turn in their arms. Olmo convinces the peasants to do so, overcoming their skepticism. Alone with Olmo, Alfredo declares to him: ""The padrone is alive"", indicating the struggle between the working and ruling classes is destined to continue.The film ends with the middle aged Alfredo and Olmo playfully tackling each other as they did in their childhood, then the scene suddenly jumps forward several years to the present day 1976, with the elderly Alfredo and Olmo walking along a railway track. Alfredo lies down in the center of the tracks as his younger self would do as a game while a train would run over the tracks, but Alfredo would emerge unharmed as he would lie perfectly still. Alfredo appears to lay himself across the tracks as a train approaches in a clear attempt at suicide as if he has chosen to end his life at that time. The final shot shows the train traveling over the younger Alfredo lying perfectly still in the center of the tracks."
Murder by Death,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Five famous literary detective characters and their sidekicks are invited to a bizarre mansion to solve an even stranger mystery. Despite not knowing him, the world's most famous detectives can't pass up the offer of a ""dinner and murder"" invitation from wealthy Lionel Twain (Truman Capote). Each has no idea until their arrival at Two Two Twain who else will be in attendance. Those detectives are: amateur sleuths and New York City socialites Dick (David Niven) and Dora Charleston (Dame Maggie Smith), accompanied by their pet terrier, Myron; Belgian detective Monsieur Milo Perrier (James Coco), accompanied by his chauffeur, Marcel (James Cromwell); Shanghainese Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), accompanied by his Japanese adopted son, Willie Wang (Richard Narita); frumpish Brit Miss Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), accompanied by her invalid nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood); and San Francisco gumshoe Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), accompanied by his femme fatale sidekick, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan). The dinner part of the invitation runs into problems due to the non-communication between Twain's blind butler, Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), and Twain's new deaf-mute and non-Anglophone cook, Yetta (Nancy Walker). On the murder side, the guests initially believe Twain will try to kill each of them. However, Twain eventually announces his rationale for the gathering: that one of the people at the dinner table will be murdered before midnight, and that Twain will consider himself the greatest detective if his guests, who are now trapped in the house until dawn, cannot figure out who committed the murder, that person also at the dinner table. If one does figure out who committed the crime, he or she will be the recipient of one million dollars and the exclusive rights to the story. So the guests anxiously await the stroke of midnight, with those still alive after that time trying to figure out motive and the opportunity to murder before the rise of dawn, and before the murderer has the opportunity to strike again on one or all of them.—Huggo Millionnaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites the five most brilliant private eyes to a dinner, and a murder. So, Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers) from China, Dick Charleston (David Niven) from New York City, Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) from England, Milo Perrier (James Coco) from Belgium, and Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) from San Francisco arrive at the remote castle. They are welcomed by Jamesir Bensonmum (Sir Alec Guinness), the blind butler. At nine, a dinner is supposed to be served. The five private eyes and their companionships are in the dining room, wondering what everything is about. Suddenly, Lionel Twain appears and lets the private eyes in on his plan: Exactly at midnight, a murder is going to take place. He offers one million dollars to the one who can solve the murder. Then he disappears. Before long, a problem arises: The butler is found dead, and it's long before midnight. Will the five most brilliant minds of our time be able to see through the elaborate set-up staged by a criminal mastermind?—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) has invited the five greatest detectives to a ""dinner and murder"". How can they resist? Included are a blind butler, a deaf-mute maid, screams, spinning rooms, secret passages, false identities, and more plot turns and twists than are decently allowed.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> A mysterious millionaire named Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) sends invitations to master detectives Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), Milo Perrier (James Coco), Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), and Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lancaster). The invitation reads, ""You are cordially invited to Dinner and a Murder at 22 Lola Lane, Saturday evening 7 P.M.""On Saturday night, the Charlestons are lost in a fog. Dick tries to call his host, but Twain's telephone line has been cut by an unseen culprit.
Sidney Wang and his adopted Japanese son, Willie (Richard Narita), stop to read a map and encounter Dick.In another car, Tess Skeffington (Eileen Brennan) recites Twain's dossier to her employer/paramour, Sam Diamond. The car runs out of gas and Tess is required to hike five miles to the nearest station.In another car, Milo and his personal chauffeur Marcel Cassette (James Cromwell) are trying to find the address and also are having trouble driving through the fog.When Sidney and Willie arrive at Twain's door, they barely miss being struck by a falling gargoyle. They are greeted by Jamessir Bensonmum (Alec Guinness), the blind butler, who takes them to their room, where ""a cozy fire"" is consuming the bed. The Charlestons arrive next, sipping martinis to ease the shock of their close call with a falling gargoyle. Bensonmum leads them to their room, which is covered in dust and cobwebs. In the kitchen, Bensonmum informs Yetta (Nancy Walker), the kitchen maid, of her duties. His effort is wasted, as she is deaf and mute, but he cannot see the note explaining her condition.Bensonmum returns to the living room to find Milo, who complains that Marcel has received a minor injury from a falling gargoyle. Sam is less passive about his gargoyle encounter and threatens Bensonmum at gunpoint. The guests gather in the drawing room for cocktails and deduce that the world's greatest detectives have been brought together for a reason. Sam and Tess enter, followed soon after by Jessica Marbles and her wheelchair-bound nurse, Miss Withers (Estelle Winwood). The group is summoned to the dining room. Bensonmum serves soup from an empty tureen. He apologizes and goes to the kitchen to fire Yetta, still unaware of the futility.After narrowly escaping death from poisoned wine and falling swords, the guests meet their host, whose entrance is accompanied by flashing colored lights. Twain announces that he will prove himself to be the world's greatest criminologist. A murder is to be committed at midnight, and both the killer and the victim are currently at the table. Twain wagers $1 million against their reputations that none of the five detectives will be able to solve the crime. With the push of a button, he seals them inside the house, and then makes a dramatic exit. Yetta storms into the dining room and ""screams,"" although she produces no sound. Sidney, Jessica and Milo go to the kitchen, where they discover the body of Bensonmum, and notice a butcher knife missing from the knife rack. Locked out of the dining room, Milo retrieves the key from Bensonmum, but the body has disappeared and only the butler's clothes remain. They find the dining room deserted, but Twain, watching from the moose head on the wall, assures the detectives that no one has left the dining room and instructs them to leave the room and re-enter. They follow Twain's instructions and find all the guests in place. The sound of gunshots emanates from the kitchen, prompting Dick and Sam to investigate. Bensonmum's body has reappeared, but without clothing.While Dick uses the bathroom, Sam returns to the dining room, which is again deserted. When he opens the bathroom door, Sam sees a cobweb-covered bed occupied by the Charlestons' terrier. Dick reappears when Sam closes the door and reopens it. Sam enters the dining room and tells the other guests of his experience, which leads them to deduce that Twain has ""two of everything"" in the house. Milo leaves the room to demonstrate by knocking three times. Dick returns, followed moments later by Milo, who has been squeezed into Bensonmum's suit.As the clock is about to strike midnight, Dora notices that Yetta has disappeared and there is a knock on the door. Twain stands in the doorway and falls forward, revealing a butcher knife and multiple stab wounds in his back. Dora concludes that Yetta is the culprit, but Sam discovers a case containing Yetta's components, proving the maid to be an automaton robot. Dora then asserts that one of the guests must be the murderer.The guests assemble in the drawing room, where they posit their theories. Dick believes the murder was an elaborate suicide. Sidney suspects Dick, explaining that the Charlestons are destitute and have been borrowing money from Twain at seventeen percent interest. Dick draws attention to Jessica, explaining that Twain, her former fiancee, left her at the altar. Milo suggests patricide, and Tess admits that Twain was her uncle, but he was also Sidney's adoptive father. When Twain realized, after 19 years, that his son was Asian, Sidney was forced to leave home. Wang counters by reminding Milo of Marie Louise Cartier, Milo's poodle, which Twain hunted and killed. Tess divulges that Sam also hated Twain because he had photographs of Sam wearing women's clothing from the night they met in a gay bar, although Sam argues that he was undercover.When they retire to their bedrooms, the Wangs are threatened by a deadly snake. At the same time, the Charlestons are frozen in fear as a scorpion crawls toward them. In their bedroom, Jessica and Miss Withers smell poison gas. In their room, Sam and Tess receive notice of a hidden time bomb ticking down. As the bomb is heard exploding, Milo and Marcel are trapped in their room and are about to be crushed by a descending ceiling.In the drawing room, the very much alive and not-blind Bensonmum crosses the detectives' names off of a list. However, each of the guests appears in the room having miraculously cheated death for various reasons, and offers his or her solution in hopes of winning the $1 million wager. Sidney relies on the old adage, ""the butler did it,"" while Jessica knows Bensonmum to actually be Irving Goldman, Twain's attorney. Dick suggests that Bensonmum is an accountant named Marvin Metzner, but Milo believes him to be Twain's daughter, Rita, whose hatefulness stems from her manly appearance. Sam announces that he and Tess are actors, and Bensonmum is the real Sam Diamond, who created this ruse to prove his superiority to his colleagues.After humoring each of them, the butler removes his mask and reveals himself to be the very much alive Twain himself. He berates the detectives for exploiting their readers with nonsensical surprise endings and other unscrupulous devices. Their reputations will be ruined when the world learns that Twain outsmarted them.As the guests leave, without the $1 million, Sam admits to Tess that he really is Sam Diamond, while Dick explains to his wife that everything they've experienced was fake, including the fog. When Willie asks Wang if there had really been a murder or not, Wang replies: ""Yes. Killed a good weekend!""Alone in his home, Twain pulls off yet another mask to reveal the mute Yetta, who lights up a cigarette and laughs diabolically while rings of cigarette smoke fill the screen.End credits."
The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074806/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A thirteen-year-old girl, who lives with her absentee father, befriends a disabled teenage amateur magician and invites him, gradually, into her tenuous struggle against a predatory local neighbor. In a little seaside town, thirteen year-old Rynn Jacobs is celebrating her birthday alone on a Halloween night. She and her father had arrived from England recently and leased the house for three years from Mrs. Cora Hallet. Out of the blue, Mrs. Hallet's pervert son Frank Hallet visits Rynn and sexually harasses her. Then his mother visits the house and asks for Rynn's father. The girl tells her that he traveled to New York. Mrs. Hallet says she needs her jelly glasses that are stored in the cellar and Rynn asks the impolite woman to go. Later ,Mrs. Hallet returns and opens the cellar door despite Rynn. However, the support of the cellar door hits her head and she dies. Rynn tries to get rid of Mrs. Hallet's car to hide the evidence but she has trouble starting the car so aspiring magician, Mario Podesta, helps her. Rynn immediately trusts Mario and discloses her secret to him. What is Rynn's secret?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Published poet Lester Jacobs has signed a three year lease with wealthy real estate agent Cora Hallet to rent a house in the town of Wells, on the New England coast, the house, which she owns, where he and his thirteen year old daughter, Rynn Jacobs, will live upon moving from England, with the plan being that Rynn will be home schooled. Mrs. Hallet, who has a sense of entitlement in her high standing in town, abuses her landlord position in almost all aspects. One of the worst kept secrets in town among certain circles is that Mrs. Hallet's married son, Frank Hallet, preys on girls much like Rynn, Mrs. Hallet who uses her position to keep Frank out of criminal/legal trouble and who will not tolerate any disparaging remarks about him despite knowing the stories about him are true. Unlike Mrs. Hallet's expectation of seeing Lester out and about in town, Rynn becomes the face of the Jacobs' household to the town, which to some extent works perfectly well for Frank in being able to spend time alone with Rynn without fear of Lester. The way that Lester and Rynn had devised this living situation is a little more difficult than Rynn had anticipated with a few unforeseen circumstances, especially concerning Mrs. Hallet, and thus she takes into her confidence older polio-afflicted teen Mario Podesta, which has its own potential issues in he being the nephew of one of the town's police officers, Ron Miglioriti, in they needing to hide Rynn and Lester's secret from especially the authorities.—Huggo Thirteen-year-old Rynn Jacobs lives in a secluded house located in a quiet seaside community. She and her father have recently rented the house, sparking the curiosity of the townsfolk. Yet, whenever anyone tries to visit, Rynn's father is never around; it appears as if she is all alone. Rynn's resourcefulness is put to the test when several people, including the snobby landlady and her sleazy son, try to find out what Rynn might be hiding.—acidxian Rynn (Jodie Foster) is a 13-year-old girl who lives in a semi-isolated cottage near the ocean. We see her preparing a birthday cake for herself, although there is nobody with her to celebrate. She is unexpectedly visited by a man named Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen), and before letting him in, Rynn lights a clove cigarette and blows some of the smoke around the living room. Rynn is uncomfortable with his visit, and we can sense right away that his intentions are predatory. They have an uncomfortable verbal sparring match; Hallet attempts frighten Rynn, and then invites himself into her house. It is Halloween, and he has arrived ahead of his own children, who are out trick-or-treating. Rynn has no Halloween candy to offer, so she cuts them each a piece of birthday cake. Hallet seems to understand something about Rynn's situation; although he comments on the smell of cigarettes and Rynn says her father is upstairs in his study, Hallet makes a number of bold advances on Rynn and touches her inappropriately before leaving. Rynn takes comfort in her hamster, Gordon. Rynn is also visited by a kind policeman, Officer Miglioriti (Mort Shuman). Miglioriti seems genuinely concerned with Rynn, although she gives him the same runaround about her father being indisposed. Miglioriti seems to be aware of Frank Hallet's pedophilia, although Rynn oddly does not mention to him that Hallet has been acting this way toward her.Rynn's confrontation with Frank is followed up the next day by a visit from his mother, Mrs. Hallet (Alexis Smith). Mrs. Hallet is Rynn's landlady, and her attitude is extremely abrasive. She barges into Rynn's house without asking, and she rearranges furniture in the house as if she lives there. When Rynn's father is not available to speak to her, Mrs. Hallet makes a vague threat about her connections with the school board; she wonders why Rynn is never in school with the other children of the town. It becomes clear that Mrs. Hallet's concerns are not about Rynn's education, but rather the fact that she is in this isolated house alone and her son is making advances toward her. Mrs. Hallet says she wants to collect a case of empty jars that are in Rynn's basement; Rynn refuses to allow her to go into the basement and tells her to come back later for the jars.After this confrontation, Rynn goes to the town and looks up public records at the library, and she discovers that Mrs. Hallet was lying about her connections to the school board. Rynn sees Frank again in town, but Frank is frightened away by the sudden appearance of Miglioriti. The policeman gives her a ride home and they have a friendly conversation; Miglioriti comes to understand that Rynn is much wiser than her actual age. She speaks a number of languages and has a level of cunning and awareness that would normally belong to an adult.When Mrs. Hallet returns to collect the jelly jars, she demands to speak to Rynn's father. Rynn refuses and says her father is out. This time Rynn is blunt with Mrs. Hallet, indicating that she will not be intimidated by the woman and that she knows she is simply protecting her pedophile son. Mrs. Hallet is enraged, especially when Rynn tells her that she knows she lied about the school board. Mrs. Hallet goes to leave and realizes that the jars do not have any lids; Rynn forgot them in the cellar. When she heads toward the cellar, which is accessed by a trap door in the floor, Rynn becomes panicked and screams at Mrs. Hallet to get out. Instead, she pushes her way past Rynn and goes into the cellar. From the basement, we hear her scream and she rushes back upstairs in terror, but she knocks the door loose and it crashes down on her head. Rynn looks down and sees Mrs. Hallet lying on the cellar steps, dead.Rynn attempts to cover up the evidence of Mrs. Hallet's visit; she hides her umbrella and tries to start her car to move it. The car won't start, and it attracts the attention of Mario (Scott Jacoby), a boy who is passing by on a bicycle. Mario is around Rynn's age, and he is on his way to a birthday party where he is to perform magic tricks. Mario is a gentle young man who walks with a cane due to an instance of polio in his childhood. Mario promises to help Rynn later, and he returns later to help her hide the car. Rynn makes him dinner, and when his uncle drops by to check on Rynn, Mario tells him Rynn's father was there but has gone to bed. Rynn is grateful that Mario has helped her keep the illusion going, although she doesn't open up to Mario right away about the reasons for her deceitfulness.Frank Hallet also shows up that night and interrupts their dinner; he is looking for his missing mother. Rynn refuses to discuss it with him, even though he kills her hamster by burning it to death with a cigarette. He also humiliates Mario, until Mario suddenly turns on him by revealing a knife hidden inside his cane. Frank runs off, but it is clear he will return.Rynn then tells Mario her secrets. She allows him to go into the cellar and he sees the corpses of both Mrs. Hallet and Rynn's mother. Rynn explains that her father was terminally ill, and that he was concerned about Rynn's estranged mother showing up to collect her if it became known that he was dead. Rynn and her father conspired to make sure that his death would be as inconspicuous as possible; Rynn's rent is paid for the next three years, and her funds are secured in a safety deposit box in the local bank. Almost every aspect of her existence is accounted for, and the only variable was her mother. Rynn's father gave Rynn a vial of white powder and told her to put it into her mother's tea if she ever showed up looking for her. It was cyanide, and Rynn began to suspect this even before her mother collapsed and died. Afterwards she hid her mother's body in the basement.Mario seems to understand and accept Rynn's situation, and he becomes her co-conspirator. He helps Rynn to bury the bodies outside the house, but catches a serious cold in the process. Later Rynn is visited by Miglioriti again, and he is on the verge of exposing Rynn's lies about her father. Suddenly Rynn's father appears and talks to Miglioriti, who is now embarassed that he ever doubted the man's existence. Miglioriti doesn't know that he is actually talking to Mario, who is wearing a disguise including a rubber mask. Miglioriti leaves, satisfied that Rynn's father will take care of any further problems.Mario's condition worsens, and he is hospitalized for pneumonia. Rynn visits him but he is sleeping and cannot hear her. She now understands that even though she has tried to be entirely self-sufficient, she has come to depend on Mario.When Rynn returns home, she is confronted by Frank Hallet, who has emerged from her own basement, giving her quite a shock. Hallet still suspects that Rynn is responsible for the disappearance of his mother because he has found one of his mother's hairpins, and half of a bright red fingernail in the cellar. Frank seems to not really mind that his mother is gone, and he implies that he will use this information to blackmail Rynn into a sexual relationship with him.Rynn now knows what she must do. She offers to fix them some tea, and she puts cyanide into one of the cups. Before they drink, Frank becomes suspicious and makes Rynn drink the cup that was meant for him. Rynn, however, is too smart for that: she herself had taken the poisoned cup, knowing that Frank would switch them. Frank drinks the tea and Rynn watches as the cyanide kills him."
Burnt Offerings,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074258/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family moves into a large old mansion in the countryside which seems to have a mysterious and sinister power over its new residents. Ben and Marian Rolf rent a grand old country mansion as a summer getaway for themselves, their twelve year old son Davey, and Ben's Aunt Elizabeth. They feel they can't turn down the rent deal offered to them by the house's owners, siblings Roz and Arnold Allardyce, despite some reservations. First amongst those reservations, they are to take care of the house on their own, which Ben feels is too big a job, especially for Marian and the interior housekeeping. In Marian's words, the large size of the house is a ""waste"". And second and perhaps more important amongst those reservations, the Allardyces' aged mother will be staying in her room at the house, the Rolfs who are to provide a tray of food left outside her room three times a day, which Marian vows to take care of on her own, with no other members of the family to go into that isolated wing of the house so as not to disturb Mrs. Allardyce's peace. Upon their arrival at the house for the first day of their stay, they find a note from Roz and Arnold stating that they had to leave on an emergency, only with the necessary keys enclosed with no address or telephone number where they can be reached. As the summer progresses, the family members individually begin to exhibit unusual and unexplainable behavior, and unusual and unexplainable things start happening around the house. The strongest behavior ends up being Marian's total focus on renewing the house into what she says she wants it to be, or so she implies she is doing. These occurrences threaten both the loving family dynamic as well as the individual lives of the four. The answers to what is happening may be who or what lies behind the closed and often locked door of Mrs. Allardyce's bedroom.—Huggo Ben Rolf, his wife Marian and their son David visit a country manor for renting to spend summer vacation. They are welcomed by the weird siblings Roz Allardyce and Arnold Allardyce that offer the mansion for nine hundred-dollar only for the whole summer. The only condition is to feed their mother Ms. Allardyce that lives recluse in the attic three times a day. They move to the house with Ben's Aunt Elizabeth and soon Marian becomes obsessed for Ms. Allardyce and the house. Meanwhile evil things happen to the Rolf family and Ben feels that the house is absorbing their life forces. After the death of Ms. Allardyce, Ben decides to leave the manor but he realizes they are trapped in the real estate. What is happening to the family?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Ben and Marion Rolf and their son, 12-year-old Davey, drive to a remote and rundown Victorian mansion that was advertised for a summer rental. Walker, the handyman, answers their knock at the door and lets them look around. Davey plays outside while Ben and Marion find a greenhouse full of dead flowers. Roz Allardyce, a woman in her late fifties, greets the Rolfs, and the couple informs her that Ben's Aunt Elizabeth will also be joining them for the summer. After Roz and Ben negotiate the oddly low, one-time rental price of $900, they are joined by Roz's wheelchair-bound brother, Arnold. The two siblings rave about how the house is ""practically immortal."" Also, Arnold and Roz tell the Rolfs that their 85-year old mother is living upstairs, and they will have to take food to her every day over the summer. Davey, bleeding, comes inside after being hurt. Everyone except Arnold leave to help Davey clean the cut. When Walker passes by to throw out a dead potted plant, Arnold tells him that the plant isn't dead. Surprisingly, Walker notices a new leaf is growing in the pot.A few days later, the Rolfs come back with seventy-four-year-old Elizabeth to find the mansion's key and a note saying that Arnold and Roz had to leave. Ben is upset that they didn't include a number where to reach them. Marion goes to the upstairs parlor and knocks on Mrs. Allardyce's bedroom door. Getting no answer, she draws back the parlor curtains to let more light in and admires a table full of old photos and a music box. Noticing a tray of dirty dishes, Marion carries them downstairs. Marion tells Ben she didn't see Mrs. Allardyce and then declares that the third floor is off bounds to everybody except her. The old lady will be Marion's responsibility. Elizabeth then declares that all the clocks in the house have stopped working.The next day, Ben and Davey restore a dilapidated pool, and then find the Allardyce family graveyard while exploring the surrounding woods. Ben notices there are no graves more recent than 1890. A week passes and still Mrs. Allardyce doesn't respond to Marion's knocking. Also, her tray is barely touched. Marion opens the music box and a dreamy expression crosses her face as the music plays.Meanwhile, Elizabeth, Davey and Ben are at the pool. Ben dives in and finds a pair of broken glasses that he puts on. Davey jumps in and, although the boy can't swim, Ben lets his son somersault off his shoulders. Suddenly, Ben thrusts Davey down and holds him under the water. Ben doesn't let go until Davey hits him in the face with his scuba mask. During the night, Ben dreams he is a boy and is being driven to his mother's funeral by a skeletal chauffeur with an evil grin.The next morning, Marion goes to the pool where she is shocked to see that it looks brand new. In the living room, Ben apologizes to Davey. That evening, Marion finds Ben by the pool, which she suggests that she polished up to look new. At Marion's cajoling, Ben jumps in and, a minute later, she strips down and joins him. They embrace, but Marion quickly pushes him away and gets out. Ben follows and tries to make love to his wife on the front lawn, but when Marion sees lights on in the old lady's room, she runs away.Going into the parlor, Marion opens the music box and falls asleep. The next morning in the kitchen, Elizabeth complains to Marion that the summer vacation is wearing her out. Elizabeth also notices the new gray growing in Marion's hair. Then, instead of taking a nap, Elizabeth brings Mrs. Allardyce a picture she has painted of the house. Elizabeth can barely climb the stairs without collapsing. Responding to Elizabeth's knocking on the parlor door, Marion says that Mrs. Allaradyce is asleep. Out front, Ben sees a model T hearse drive up that is being driven by the grinning chauffeur from his nightmare. Ben covers his face and, when he looks again, the hearse has disappeared.At midnight, all the clocks reset by themselves and chime the hour. Waking up, Ben smells gas coming from a heater in Davey's room. Ben kicks the locked door down and carries Davey out to a hallway window. After turning off the gas, Ben smashes out a stuck bedroom window with a baseball bat. In the morning, Elizabeth confesses to Marion that she was in Davey's room, but did not touch the gas. Marion demands to know what else Elizabeth did, as someone locked the door and closed the window. When Elizabeth wonders if Mrs. Allardyce did it, Marion explodes. Later, Ben finds Elizabeth crying in her room and looking twenty years older. She wants to leave the house, but when Ben asks her to come down so Marion can apologize, she says she will later.In the parlor, Ben finds Marion, wearing an antique broach and shawl, who insists Elizabeth had something to do with Davey's accident. When Ben asks why he can't meet the old lady, Marion says that Mrs. Allaradyce is sleeping. Meanwhile, Elizabeth sits up in bed, and a loud crack of breaking bones is heard.At dinner, Ben asks Marion if she would leave the house if he asked her too. She says he's being ridiculous. Davey yells for help and Ben and Marion find Elizabeth writhing in pain. Ben runs downstairs to phone for help, but the line is busy. Marion then tries the phone and comes back saying that the doctor is on the way. Ben asks Marion to wait downstairs, but instead she goes to the parlor, opens the music box and eats Mrs. Allardyce's food. Sitting with Elizabeth, Ben hears a car coming, which he sees out the window is the model T hearse. Elizabeth's bedroom door bangs open and the grinning chauffeur thrusts a coffin at them. Meanwhile, Marion goes into the greenhouse where the flowers are in full bloom.After Elizabeth's funeral, Ben and Davey find Marion dressed in Victorian attire. Marion says she couldn't go to the funeral because she couldn't leave Mrs. Allardyce alone. Although Marion has made a candlelight dinner, she storms out when Ben says he's not hungry. Ben follows her and insists on meeting the old lady. Marion claims she can't open the door as Mrs. Allardyce has the only key. Ben tells her they're leaving in the morning and, although Marion says she can't leave the old lady alone, he claims that in any event he and Davey are going. That night, Ben is awakened by the sound of bricks, tiles and siding that are falling off the house. Ben grabs Davey, runs to the car, and drives off. However, a tree falls, blocking his path. Unable to lift the tree, Ben tries to ram it out of the way with the car, but hits his head on the steering wheel. Marion climbs into the car and drives them back to the house. When Ben looks at her, he sees the chauffeur grinning back at him.A doctor comes and says that Ben needs to go to a hospital. When Davey asks Marion if they are going home, she says his father is better off staying put. The next day, a comatose Ben sits by the pool in a wheelchair. Davey jumps in the pool, which begins to churn with giant waves. Marion sees her imperiled son from inside his bedroom, but can't open the window. Ben tries to move, but only falls out of the chair. Marion runs downstairs and smashes a window to get out of the house. She runs to the pool, dives in and rescues Davey. She hugs her husband and son and says they are leaving today.Although Marion gets in the car with her family, she quickly gets out, insisting she has to give Mrs. Allardyce their phone number. When Marion doesn't return, Ben goes after her. Finding Mrs. Allardyce's door unlocked, Ben looks in to see the back of a white haired woman in a wheelchair. He asks where Marion is. Not getting an answer, he swings the chair around, and discovers that the old woman is Marion. Ben crashes through the bedroom window and lands on the car's windshield below. Davey yells for his Mom, but the chimney collapses, killing him.Later the Allardyce siblings return. The house looks entirely new and the flowers are all blooming. Arnold says that their mother has been restored to her full glory. In the parlor there are four new pictures: Ben, Marion, Davey and Elizabeth... the latest victims of the Allardyce siblings and the house."
"Alice, Sweet Alice",1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076150/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1961, a divorced Catholic couple's life is turned upside-down when one of their two adolescent daughters is suspected of her younger sister's brutal murder during her First Holy Communion and a series of subsequent stabbings. Alice Spages is a withdrawn 12-year-old girl who lives with her younger sister Karen and their mother Catherine. Karen gets most of their mother's attention, and Alice is often left out. When Karen is found brutally murdered in a church before her First Holy Communion, Alice is thrust into the spotlight of suspicion, but is a 12-year-old girl really capable of such savagery? As more people die at the hands of a merciless killer, Alice's family and the police don't know what to believe.—Anonymous Alice Spages is a problematic 12-year-old rebel who lives with her younger sister Karen and their divorced mother Catherine, who fawns over Karen and neglects Alice. During Karen's First Communion, she is strangled by a masked woman dressed in a St. Michael's yellow coat and wearing a creepy mask. Alice takes her place in line wearing her veil, which she claims she found on the floor, and becomes the police's prime suspect. When Catherine's sister Annie is stabbed in the leg several times, she accuses Alice and gets her sent to have a psychological evaluation over the protests of her parents and their friend Father Tom, but Alice's father Dominick sees evidence that will prove her innocence.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil New Jersey, 1961. Alice Spages (Paula E. Sheppard) is a 12-year old girl who lives with her mother, Catherine (Linda Miller), and her younger 10-year-old sister, Karen (Brooke Shields). Their father, Dominic (Niles McMaster), is divorced from Catherine, and has recently re-married. Catherine and the girls live in a humble apartment, and their lives are very much centered on their Catholic parish. Both Alice and Karen go to the small Catholic school associated with their church, and all of the students wear church-issued yellow rain slickers as part of their uniforms. Karen is just about to make her first holy communion, but Alice seems to be jealous of the attention that Karen is getting because of it. Alice appears to have some major emotional problems.In the opening scene, Alice, Catherine and Karen are visiting the young priest Father Tom (Rudolph Willrich) at the rectory, discussing Karen's upcoming first Holy Communion. Alice startles the rectory's housekeeper, Mrs. Tredoni (Mildred Clinton), by wearing a bizarre translucent mask, and she terrorizes Karen by stealing her doll and luring her to an abandoned building. While inside the building, Alice frightens Karen with the mask and briefly locks her in a room alone, threatening to never return her doll if she tells their mother about the incident. In the family's apartment, Alice takes Karen's communion veil and models it herself in a mirror; Karen causes a commotion over it and Catherine has to intervene.Things go from bad to worse on the day of Karen's communion. As the parishioners sit in the pews waiting for the children to enter the sanctuary, Catherine and her younger sister Annie (Jane Lowry) notice that Alice is not with them. Annie sends her daughter Angela (Kathy Rich) to look for Alice. Before Karen can join the rest of the girls who are dressed in their white communion dresses and veils, she is attacked by a figure in one of the school's yellow rain slickers, wearing the same translucent mask that Alice wears. The figure strangles Karen and then stows her body in a hollow bench, setting it on fire. Just before burning the body, the killer snatches the small cross that Karen wears around her neck, ripping the pendant from her body. Alice then appears among the younger girls, in Karen's place and wearing her veil, awaiting holy communion. Annie is outraged and urges Catherine to put a stop to it immediately. Shortly after, a nun notices the smoke and discovers Karen's body, her screams summoning the rest of the congregation. Annie sees Karen's body and melodramatically tells Catherine that her daughter is dead. Catherine breaks down crying. Alice slips Karen's veil into her pocket.Dominic returns for Karen's funeral and Catherine weeps when she sees him. The domineering Annie imposes herself on Catherine and Alice, insisting that she will stay with them to help Catherine with anything she needs. Alice is resentful of Annie's presence, and wants to stay home with her mother instead of going back to school. Annie's obvious dislike for the girl gives way to accusations about Karen's murder; Annie points out the fact that Alice's whereabouts during the murder are unaccounted for. Catherine seems to be unwilling to admit that Alice acts strangely, insisting that nobody understands Alice like she does. She has to smooth over a confrontation between Annie and Alice, sending Alice on an errand to defuse the argument.Catherine has Alice take the rent check to the family's landlord, Mr. Alphonso (Alphonso DeNoble), who lives in one of the lower apartments of the building. Alphonso is a grotesque man, extremely obese and living in an apartment full of kittens, with old music playing regularly in the background of his apartment; we see him feeding the kittens, referring to himself as ""mommy"", and then eating some of the moist cat food himself. Alphonso has repeatedly made jabs at Alice regarding Karen's death; he aligns himself with Alice's Aunt Annie, saying that Alice must have had something to do with Karen's murder. He also tells Alice that he knows about the odd shrine she has in the basement of the building, where she keeps various objects that she has either found or stolen, including the mask and Karen's missing doll. He tells Alice that Karen will return from the dead to collect her doll. When he makes inappropriate advances toward Alice and begins to touch her in a lewd manner, Alice, in retaliation, throttles one of the kittens and strangles it to death and yelling ""you never do that again!"", upsetting Alphonso and allowing her to escape.Meanwhile, the detectives investigating Karen's murder summon Alice's school records from the parish. When Dominic visits the police station to discuss Karen's case, he becomes hostile when Detective Brennan (Tom Signorelli) suggests that he would like to question Alice about the murder. He phones the rectory to talk to Father Tom, with whom he is apparently familiar; at first his phone call is intercepted by Mrs. Tredoni, who is fiercely protective of the priests and the elderly monsignor who reside there. Tom picks up an extension and talks to Dominic, asking if they can meet in person. Dominic seems unaware of Alice's emotional problems, which have resulted in a number of questionable incidents at school. Father Tom tells him that Alice has a knack for causing trouble and making it seem like an accident.Alice goes into the basement to her shrine, where she keeps her strange items, one of them being a jar full of large cockroaches, which she keeps alive by feeding them. She also still has Karen's doll. Alice puts on her mask.Upstairs, the mysterious figure wearing the yellow rain slicker and mask is creeping around the hallways. Annie goes to leave the apartment and she is attacked by the figure. The killer stands on the landing and slashes at Annie's legs and feet was she walks down the stairs, seriously wounding her with a kitchen knife. Before the killer can administer the death blow, Annie's screams summon Mr. Alphonso, who sees the killer's outfit and immediately identifies it as Alice. As the masked raincoat figure flees, Annie, who is hysterical and terrified, drags herself out into the street in the pouring rain, where Catherine finds her. Dominic and Father Tom happen to pull up at the same time, in Father Tom's car. Tom and Catherine rush Annie to the hospital, while Dominic goes into the building to look for the person who attacked Annie. In the basement, he finds Alice at her shrine, terrified; she claims she saw Karen, apparently believing what Alphonso told her about Karen returning to claim her doll. Dominic comforts her; like Catherine, Dominic doesn't believe that Alice could be a killer.At the hospital, Catherine tries to get Annie to recant her story about being attacked by ""Alice"", but Detective Spina shows up to question Annie and she becomes hysterical, screaming that Alice was the one who stabbed her. They bring Alice into the police station to question her, giving her a lie detector test from Detective Cranston (Ted Tinling). Although Alice does not implicate herself, she gives a number of strange responses; one of the things that the lie detector machine reveals is that Alice sincerely believes that Karen is the one who attacked Aunt Annie. Alice resents being questioned, even lashing out at the lie detector machine, deliberately throwing it on the floor when they leave her alone with it.Although the police cannot charge Alice with either Karen's murder or Annie's slashing, they still feel she may be responsible for one or both, and they order her to have a psychological evaluation at the Sara Reed Children's Hospital. Catherine and Dominic are furious, but try to make the best of it. They visit Alice at the hospital together, discussing the case with the doctor who examines her, Dr. Whitman (Louisa Horton). Dr. Whitman's evaluation seems especially damning, suggesting that Alice is schizophrenic and possibly dangerous. Whitman refuses to allow Alice to be released.Dominic and Catherine have a quiet moment back at Catherine's apartment, when Catherine gets a strange phone call consisting of nothing but breathing; we see the caller is wearing the translucent mask. When the caller hangs up, Catherine assumes it was Annie; since Annie identified Alice as her attacker, Catherine vowed to disown Annie forever. Discussing the recent tragic events of their lives, Dominic and Catherine both agree that Alice could not have been responsible for all that's happened. Dominic suggests that perhaps Angela was the one who attacked Annie, which could explain why Alice thought she saw Karen, since they all wear the same yellow raincoat. Catherine, however, points out that Angela is an overweight young girl, and Karen was very petite, so it would be unlikely for Alice to confuse them. They wind up holding each other and beginning to make love, but are interrupted by a phone call from Dominic's wife, which breaks the mood.Dominic returns to his hotel in time to receive a phone call from a sobbing voice; the caller identifies herself as Angela, saying that she ran away from home and needs Dominic to help her. She asks him to come to the abandoned building, the same one where Alice scared Karen at the beginning of the movie. When Dominic arrives, he sees the figure in the yellow raincoat and mask off in the distance. When he follows her into the building, she attacks him with the kitchen knife, stabbing him in the shoulder. Still unsure of who it is, Dominic follows her up a staircase, where the figure surprises him and bludgeons him repeatedly with a brick.With Dominic unconscious, the figure binds him with a cord and rolls him over to a loading door; the drop over the precipice is three or four stories to the ground. Dominic regains consciousness and realizes he is about to fall to his death. The killer removes the mask to reveal Mrs. Tredoni underneath. She rants about Dominic's relationship with Catherine, revealing that she knows that Alice was conceived before Dominic and Catherine were married. Dominic screams for help, but the area is too desolate for anybody to hear him. He uses his teeth to grab the crucifix that Mrs. Tredoni wears, the same one that she pulled from Karen's body the day she killed her. Mrs. Tredoni notices it and uses the brick to try and smash in Dominic's teeth. He refuses to give up the cross, swallowing it instead. Mrs. Tredoni, now furious, pushes him over the ledge and he falls to his death.Mrs. Tredoni then goes to the church, where a group of children are being instructed on how to make their first confession. Father Tom is the one who is going to hear the children, but he goes into the confessional to find that Mrs. Tredoni is already in there, changing out of the costume she wears to impersonate Alice. She pretends she is seeking to make a confession, and claims she feels guilty about having thoughts regarding the Monsignor; she says that he is in such poor health that she sometimes wishes he would pass away. Father Tom tells her she is a good woman, and that she doesn't need to come to confession about this since her thoughts are not sinful. He praises her for the care she has given himself and the other priests, and she is ecstatic when he calls her a friend.The next day, Catherine becomes worried when she does not hear from Dominic, and she goes to the rectory to look for him; she reasons that since he has been borrowing Father Tom's car, he may be there. She is greeted by Mrs. Tredoni, who tries to get rid of her but finally allows her in to wait for Father Tom. Mrs. Tredoni is gutting fish for that evening's dinner, and she brings Catherine into the kitchen after preparing coffee for her. Catherine is uneasy, when Mrs. Tredoni reveals that she also had a daughter who died on the day of her first holy communion, Mrs. Tredoni seizes the kitchen knife and brandishes it toward Catherine while calling her a whore for having her own child out of wedlock. Father Tom returns and interrupts their conversation, telling Catherine that Dominic's body has been discovered. Catherine weeps in frustration and horror.Dominic's murder suggests that Alice is no longer a suspect, and Catherine is able to take her home. After they return, the figure in the yellow rain slicker and mask enters Alphonso's apartment while he is sleeping, and places the jar of roaches from Alice's secret shrine on his chest. Removing the mask, the figure reveals itself to be Alice herself. Catherine catches her leaving Alphonso's apartment, but Alice explains that she was only saying hello to him after returning from the hospital. Catherine praises her for being kind to him, and they leave to go to mass.Outside, Detective Spina is watching the building as protection for Alice and Catherine. When they leave the building, Mrs. Tredoni slips in the back through the basement, wearing the yellow rain slicker and mask. She goes up to Catherine's apartment, apparently planning on murdering the first person she sees, but she finds the door locked. As she knocks on Catherine's door, Alphonso awakens and reacts in horror when the roaches begin to crawl over him. He starts screaming and alerts Spina that something is wrong. Mrs. Tredoni hears it too, and she panics that he is drawing attention to the scene too soon. She runs back down the stairs, but Alphonso emerges and sees her running past his apartment. Thinking her to be Alice, he grabs her and starts to manhandle her, so she pulls out the kitchen knife and stabs him in the chest several times. He stumbles back into his apartment and dies. Spina arrives at Alphonso's room, too late to help him. When Mrs. Tredoni tries to escape through the basement, Spina smashes down the front door and sees her. In her panic, she has forgotten to put the mask back on, and he easily identifies her.Still wearing the yellow slicker, Mrs. Tredoni returns to the church and enters the sanctuary during service, making her way to where Alice and Catherine are sitting. Outside, the police arrive and discuss the best way to apprehend Mrs. Tredoni. Father Tom warns them not to try and confront her, as she is too close to Alice and her mother. Tom believes he can convince Mrs. Tredoni to come peacefully, since she adores him.During communion, Alice, Catherine, and Mrs. Tredoni all come up to the front side by side. Father Tom gives Catherine the wafer, but skips Alice. He also skips Mrs. Tredoni, instead leaning toward her and quietly asking her to go with the police. Mrs. Tredoni becomes indignant and asks why he will not give her communion; becoming furious, she shouts ""But you give it to the whore!"", pointing at Catherine. In a rage, Mrs. Tredoni pulls out the knife and stabs Father Tom through the throat. The congregation reacts in horror. Mrs. Tredoni clutches Father Tom to her as he dies, his blood pouring over the yellow rain slicker. Alice remains curiously detached from what is happening. In the confusion, a few policemen run into the church and arrest Mrs. Tredoni, while Alice has claimed Mrs. Tredoni's bag. Alice, still having not received communion, walks out of the church and pulls out the knife briefly, fondling the handle and smiling to herself (insinuating that Alice might one day adopt Mrs. Tredoni's murderous killing spree herself)."
Eaten Alive,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074455/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychotic redneck, who owns a dilapidated hotel in rural East Texas, kills various people who upset him or his business, and he feeds their bodies to a large crocodile that he keeps as a pet in the swamp beside his hotel. Judd runs the Starlight Hotel out in some sort of swampy place and is unfortunately a few slices short of a loaf. He has a crocodile conveniently placed on the other side of the hotel's front porch railing. The croc will eat just about anything, as the hapless guests of the hotel find out soon enough. A reformed hooker, an unlucky family, and the father and sister of the hooker all suffer various rates of attrition as Judd tries to implement damage control.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> After refusing a request from frisky customer named Buck (Robert Englund) who wants anal sex, the naive and inexperienced prostitute Clara Wood (Roberta Collins) is evicted from the town brothel by the madam, Miss Hattie (Carolyn Jones). Clara makes her way across the local swamp to a decrepit hotel, called the Starlight Hotel, to check into a room for the night where she encounters the scruffy and mentally disturbed proprietor Judd (Neville Brand) and his pet crocodile in the swamp beside the front porch. Upon realizing Clara was a prostitute, Judd attacks her while ranting and raving. When Clara tries to defend herself, Judd stabs her with a pitchfork and feeds her to the crocodile.Some days later, a fractious couple, the outgoing Faye (Marilyn Burns) and her mentally disturbed husband Roy (William Finley), along with their young daughter Angie (Kyle Richards) arrive at the hotel to check in since they are driving across country. They soon experience the trauma of the Angie's persistently barking and overly curious pet dog being eaten by the crocodile. Faye and Roy take their daughter to their room to try and try to calm her down.The insane Roy decides to shoot the crocodile with a shotgun for eating their dog, but Judd intervenes. During the struggle, Roy shoots Judd in his right leg, but it is revealed that Judd's right leg is a wooden prosthetic which he apparently lost years earlier when it was bitten off by his pet crocodile. Judd angrily stabs Roy with a scythe before he is attacked and devoured by the huge crocodile which breaks through the porch railing and swallows Roy whole.After getting Angie to sleep, Faye goes into the bathroom for a bath, however she is interrupted by Judd who begins to beat her. Angie wakes up and runs from the hotel. However, Angie gets trapped underneath the hotel by Judd, who proceeds to tie up Faye in a vacant room where he spends the rest of the movie sexually fondling her while Angie remains trapped under the floorboards of the hotel.That evening, Harvey Wood (Mel Ferrer) and his daughter Libby arrive at the Starlight Hotel seeking information on the whereabouts of Clara, Harvey's daughter who had run away from home several months earlier. Judd calmly denies having ever seen Clara when he is shown a photo of her. Never less, Harvey and Libby check into separate rooms and then leave to try and locate her at Miss Hattie's brothel.Accompanied by Sheriff Martin (Stuart Whitman), Harvey and Libby question Miss Hattie, who lies to them by denying ever seeing Clara (apparently still angry over Clara upsetting her business). Harvey returns to the hotel while Libby stays in town to eat dinner with Sheriff Martin. When Harvey hears Angie's crying underneath the floorboards of the porch, he begins to investigate and is attacked by Judd who stabs him in the neck with his scythe. Judd then drags his dead body to the swamp to be eaten by the crocodile.While Sheriff Martin and Libby are at the local bar having dinner and drinks, Martin kicks out Buck and his sluttish girlfriend Lynette (Janus Blythe) after a fight nearly breaks out between Buck and another local redneck barfly. The pair venture to the hotel, much to the annoyance of Judd who had already warned Buck to stay away from his land. While in their room to have sex, they hear Angie's cries for help. Buck goes to investigate and is pushed off the porch and into the swamp by Judd, where he is quickly eaten alive by Judd's crocodile. Lynette hears the commotion, and goes outside only to be chased by Judd and his scythe into the nearby swamps. She manages to get to a road where she flags down a passing car and gets away.At the same time, Libby arrives back at the hotel and goes up to her room. Judd arrives back also, and opens up the gate for the crocodile to get in under the house so it can eat Angie. Meanwhile, Libby discovers Faye tied up in the room. After freeing her, the two women attempt to leave, however Judd chases them back upstairs where he wounds Faye with the scythe. Libby escapes out a window and begins to help Angie out of the swamp she has managed to get into to evade the crocodile. Judd throws the severely wounded Faye off a balcony and then he attempts to push Angie back into the swamp while struggling with Libby. But at the last second, Faye arrives and pushes Judd over the fence into the swamp, where he is devoured by his pet crocodile. Sheriff Martin arrives at the hotel minutes later to arrest Judd after being alerted by Lynette only to find the bloodied but alive Faye, and the shaken but unharmed Libby and Angie. All that is left of Judd is his prosthetic wooden leg floating in the swamp beside the hotel."
The Message,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074896/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"This epic historical drama chronicles the life and times of Prophet Muhammad and serves as an introduction to early Islamic history. In the 7th century, Mohammed, Peace Be Upon Him, is visited by Angel Gabriel who urges him to lead the people of Mecca and worship God. But they're exiled in Medina before returning to Mecca to take up arms against their oppressors and liberate their city in the name of God (Allah).—Anonymous The message that transformed a pagan Arab society to a civilized society is the main theme of the movie. The hardships that Mohammed, Peace Be Upon Him, like his predecessor Prophets faced along with his followers, followed by an exile, formation of a state based on values is the main plot of the movie. This is an excellent and a true depiction of the Islamic era set in the 6th century AD. To all interested in understanding a great way of life -Islam.—Masoud Abdul Rahiman Handsomely-mounted historical epic concerns the birth of the
Islamic faith and the story of the prophet Mohammed -- who, in
accordance with the tenants of Islam, is never to be depicted (as this is against certain Islamic schools of thought). In Mecca in the 7th century, Mohammed is visited by a
vision of the Angel Gabriel, who urges him to lead the people of
Mecca to cast aside the 300 idols of Kaaba and instead worship the
one true God, speaking out against the corrupt political and military
leaders who rule Mecca. With the help of his uncle, a brave warrior
named Hamza (Anthony Quinn), Mohammed and his followers return
to Mecca to liberate the city in the name of God. The Message
(originally screened in the U.S. as Mohammed, Messenger of God)
proved to be highly controversial during its production and initial
release. Unfounded rumors had it that Mohammed would not only be
depicted in the film, but that he was to be played by Charlton Heston
or Peter O'Toole. This resulted in protests by some Muslim, until director Moustapha Akkad hired a staff of respected Islamic clerics as technical advisors. The Message was shot in two
versions, one in English and one in Arabic (entitled Al-Ris-Alah), with
different actors taking over some of the roles due to language
requirements."

Pierce(The Legend Of Boggy Creek), and based on one of America's most baffling murder cases, this horrifying suspense thriller is a shocking experience you'll never forget. In the end of World War II, in Texarkana, a serial-killer begins a crime spree, assaulting and killing young couples. The famous Captain J.D. Morales brings his men and together with the local police force, with the efficient Deputy Norman Ramsey, organize patrols, but the killer attacks every fourteen days.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sunday, March 3, 1946, in the small town of Texarkana, Arkansas, Sammy and Linda Mae are out parking in a car. The car hood pops open and a man wearing a hood over his face takes something from the engine. Sammy realizes that someone is out there and fruitlessly tries starting the car as the hooded man breaks the drivers side car window with a pipe and pulls Sammy out. Linda Mae screams, and the man goes for her as well.Linda Mae is found lying severely wounded on the side of the road the following morning and both she and Sammy are taken to a nearby hospital. A doctor tells Deputy Ramsey and Sheriff Barker that Linda Mae was ""bitten"" and ""literally chewed"" on different parts of her body by the assailant. Police Chief Sullivan asks about the Lovers Lane Case and he tells the other officers to warn people about parking on lonely roads. Ramsey states his belief that the mysterious person will strike again.On March 24, Howard and his girlfriend, Emma Lou, go out driving in the rain. After hearing gunshots, Ramey, patrolling in his car, finds Howard's parked car, but no one around. Ramsey hears more gunshots and in the woods he finds Howard and Emma Lou, both dead, having been shot several times. The hooded killer gets in the parked car and drives away.Since the killer, now known as ""The Phantom"" seems to have no motive and the townspeople begin to dread sundown. A few days later, Ramsey goes to the nearby train station to meet Captain Morales, a famous criminal investigator and Texas Ranger who arrives in Texarkana to find the killer. Morales has the officers set up a curfew for the entire town. Many people are on the case, including a few associates of the FBI whom also arrive in town to assist. But a number of criminals and crazy people come forward admitting to the murders, while a horde of other citizens are demanding protection.Ramsey tells Morales that on April 14, twenty-one more days after the second attack, the killer may strike again. Morales sets up decoys (cops posing as couples in unmarked parked cars). That very night at the local Junior and High Schools Prom, many people are leaving under the watchful eyes of the police officers nearby. Peggy gets her trombone and leaves with her boyfriend Roy. Roy suggests parking at their favorite spot, despite Peggy's wariness over the recent murders. After making out, the two of them nod off and wake up in their car at 2:40 in the morning. As Roy starts the car and begins to drive away, the Phantom suddenly appears and jumps on their car, grabs Roy and causes both of them to fall out. The Phantom whacks Roy on the head with a pistol and chases Peggy down, and ties her to a tree. A dazed Roy gets up and tries to run away, but the killer shoots him dead. The killer gets Peggy's trombone, attaches a knife to the end, and ""plays"" the instrument, stabbing Peggy in the back a few times, killing her.The next day, Morales is upset that the Phantom was able to kill again with all the law officers out looking for him. In a nearby diner, Morales, Ramsey and the group talk to Dr. Kress, who says that the Phantom is apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and will probably not get caught. He also says that the killings are like a game of the Phantom. Morales asks the doctor if the killer is insane, in which Dr. Kress replies ""oh, yes!"" At a nearby table, an unseen man, (wearing the killer's boots and slacks) stands up and walks out of the diner unnoticed after he has apparently heard everything the officers were talking about.Back at the station, Morales talks to a man named Johnson, who says that he was held at gunpoint by a man claiming to have killed five people. Morales and Ramsey get a call about an armed man. They spot him speeding away from a store and chase him down. The man, Eddie, is arrested after they find that he is driving a stolen car. Johnson identifies him as the man with the gun. Under interrogation, Eddie says that he is the Phantom, but Morales does not believe him and correctly suspects that Eddie is just another nutcase who wants to confess to being the killer in order to gain publicity and fame for it.On Friday, May 3, Helen drives away after grocery shopping and is unknowingly followed by the unseen killer who is identified by his familiar boots. While she is at home in a remote farmhouse, her husband, Floyd, in the living room, is sitting in a armchair reading a newspaper when the Phantom walks up to the window and shoots him twice with a silenced pistol. Helen only hears the breaking glass and enters the living room to see Floyd fall out of his chair to the floor dead with two bullet wounds in the back of his head and neck. Helen runs to a phone to call the police when the killer bursts into the house through the front door and shoots Helen twice in the face. While the Phantom enters the living room to look at Floyd's dead body, Helen, despite being shot in her right cheek and shot through her open mouth, manages to crawl out of the house through the back door and stumbles into a cornfield. The Phantom follows her out with a pick ax. After a cat-and-mouse game of hiding in the cornfield, Helen gets to a nearby house and bangs on the door and windows yelling for help. A concerned farmer, armed with a shotgun, comes out to help her in. The killer, seeing the man with a gun, angrily flees.Another few weeks later, Ramsey and Morales get a call about an abandoned car that fits the description of the car Ramsey saw that rainy night. They find the car and they get some shotguns from their police car and run off into the woods to look for the Phantom. They find the Phantom walking around an old quarry, walking around with the hood still on him. Morales and Ramsey chase the Phantom through the woods and to railroad tracks where the Phantom jumps over the tracks and a moving train gets between them. Morales fires under the moving train and hits the killer in his left leg. The Phantom manages to stumble away into the woods on the other side of the tracks.Over the next few days, police officers and Bloodhound dogs search the woods and the nearby swamps, but the wounded killer is not found. Afterwards, the killings stop, but the fear continues on to this day. The voice-over narrator explains that no one ever found out what happened to the Phantom.In the final scene, during the Christmas season of 1976, the film 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown' premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.The voice-over narrator details the fates of each of the main characters:Captain J.D. Morales never stopped looking for the Phantom Killer.

Massacre at Central High,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074875/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A high-school transfer student pushed to the edge by a trio of brutal bullies resorts to murder to reclaim the school from oppression, and later turns against the students wanting to fill the vacuum of their oppressors. David is the new kid at Central High. The only person he knows is Mark, who runs with the local toughs led by Bruce. Mark and David share a bond from years before when David came to Mark's aid when he was being beaten by school bullies. David keeps his distance, preferring not to join the ""club."" He tries to convince the other students not to be pushed around, and intervenes once too often on their behalf. When he directly becomes a victim of Bruce's gang, David orchestrates a plan that causes an attrition problem among the members of the clique. Mark worries for his safety, although he and David were once friends.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> The film explores schoolhouse monarchy, failed rebellion, extreme revenge, star-crossed love, corruption by power, social liberation, and creative acts of violence.—Rob Sanders <wfsp49b@prodigy.com> David is a transfer student to Malibu Central High School. Upon arriving, he sees three bullies, named Bruce, Craig, and Paul, who order Spoony, a semi-skinhead and radical, to wash off a swastika he painted on his locker. The bullies inform Spoony that no forms of protest are permitted at Central High. Soon afterward, David meets Mark, an old friend who he once helped out of a jam at their previous school in Los Angeles. Mark tells David that the school can be like a country club for him if he becomes friends with Bruce, Craig, and Paul, the bullies who rule the school student body and are from wealthy and powerful backgrounds.Over the next few days, David becomes more and more alienated by the abrasive trio as he watches their daily routine. During gym class, they mock the slow-witted, fat Oscar who is unable to keep up with the other students. Later in the locker room, they hit Oscar with towels. David, at Mark's insistence, does not intervene.In the school library, the bullies taunt Arthur, the nerdish student librarian, and dump books all over him. David helps Arthur up after the bullies leave and offers his help to take them on. But Arthur tells David to stay out of it for he says, ""we fight and lose our own battles"".Later that day, David also witnesses the bullies wreck poor Rodney's car after he parks in their place in the school parking lot. David offers to help Rodney fix his car. Rodney agrees, but again tells David to stay out of Bruce, Craig, and Paul's path for he doesn't want them to be his enemies.Meanwhile, Mark meets with Bruce, Craig, and Paul in Paul's van after school where he tells them about David. But to Mark's worry, the three bullies tell him that they do not want to be friends with David and they do not want to associate themselves, nor interact and nor want anything to do with David. Mark tries to tell them that David is a good guy who can be a great friend and ally to them, but the bullies tell Mark that David looks like a trouble maker. They sternly warn Mark to tell David to stay out of their path. Mark begins to worry about his friend, but he tells the bullies that he will straighten David out.David's only other friend at the school is Teresa, who happens to be Mark's girlfriend. After Teresa and Mark quarrel over David hanging around her, she walks away wanting some space. After classes are let out for the day, the bullies spot Spoony's two girlfriends, Mary and Jane, and decide to rape them just for kicks. When Teresa catches them trying to assault the two girls, they spot her and throw her into a vacant classroom. David sees this and charges into the classroom. He single handedly beats up all three bullies before the rapes are accomplished. While Teresa is grateful to David for saving her, Mary and Jane do not thank him and tell David that he is now a marked man having crossed Craig, Bruce, and Paul.Humiliated by this latest encounter with David, the bullies approach Mark and tell him that he only has one more chance to talk to David to mind his own business. At nightfall, they drive down the Pacific Coast Highway where they find David's car. Venturing down to the beach to find David, Mark sees him with Teresa skinny dipping in the ocean. Filled with anger and jealousy, Mark goes back to the bullies in Paul's van and lies to them by saying that he tried to talk to David, but he wouldn't listen. The three bullies decide to take matters into their own hands.One evening, David is repairing Rodney's car when the bullies appear and kick the jack out and it lands on top of David, in which one of the wheels crushes his left leg. After several weeks in the hospital, David returns to school, now limping from a leg cast under trousers. But worse for David, he can no longer jog which is the one outlet for his anger. Most of the students avoid and snub David for attempting to make a stand against the bullies. Arthur tells David a great big ""I told you so"" about wanting to take on Craig, Bruce, and Paul. Even Mark is mean and nasty towards David for his flirtation with Teresa. When Mark confronts Teresa later and tells her that he saw her and David that night on the beach, she tells him about how David saved her from being raped earlier that day. She also tells Mark that although she really wanted to have sex with David that night on the beach, he refused to make love to her out of loyalty to Mark. Mark feels guilty over it realizing that he inadvertently got back at David for nothing.But David, having turned psychotic from this latest encounter, secretly plots to kill the three bullies in the same manner he believes they tried to kill him: by making it look like an accident. David begins his lethal plan of revenge when he breaks a cable on one hand glider to one of the bullies: Bruce. During the bullies Saturday hand gliding excursion, Bruce loses control of his hand glider when the cord for the steering breaks, and it rams into power lines, electrocuting him.Craig is the next victim when David intercepts a letter from the janitor to Craig about the school swimming pool being cleaned. That evening, Craig, a championship swimmer in training for the next Olympics, arrives at the school for his private practice sessions when David turns out the lights to the pool area. He tricks Craig into diving into the empty swimming pool.Paul is the final victim when David attacks him the following day in his van and rolls it down a cliff where it hits the rocks and explodes, killing Paul instantly. Mark arrives on the scene and discovers that David is responsible for Paul's death as well as Craig's and Bruce's as well. David challenges Mark to stop him, but Mark loves David too much to fight him. David, however, despite knowing that Mark knows the truth, agrees to let him live out of his love for Teresa.For a time, everyone at the school is grateful to David and is on friendly terms now that the three bullies are gone from their lives. But soon, they all tries to enlist the help of their hero and savior David so they can obtain power. From Arthur taking charge of the geeks, Oscar with the fat guys, to Rodney with the jocks, and Spoony with the punks, they take on one another for power. Soon, fights and arguments break out all over the school as Oscar, Arthur, Rodney, and Spoony quarrel with one another over territory rights. David, disgusted at the fighting and that the oppressed have become the new oppressors, plots to get rid of all the students.A few days later, David commences ""the massacre at central high"". Arthur is killed when David switches his hearing aid with another one that produces high decibel sonic pulses, which blow Arthurs eardrums out. Oscar is next when he opens his locker and a pipe bomb that David had placed earlier, explodes, killing him and several of his fat boy members. The students panic as more pipe bombs go off, killing and wounded many students. Rodney attempts to flee from the chaos in the parking lot by getting into his car and upon starting it, it explodes, killing him and a number of other jocks and other students with him. Only Spoony manages to escape and hides out in the wilderness with his two girlfriends, Mary and Jane. But David follows them and kills them as well by blowing up a face of a cliff and crushing the three of them in their tent under an avalanche of rocks.Mark, aware that David is behind all the carnage, tells Teresa that they must try to stop David before he kills more people for he has clearly been driven to the edge by everything that has happened. Mark gets a gun and with Teresa they go after David. They arrive at David's house and confront him in his workshop where he is constructing more pipe bombs. David challenges Mark to shoot him and put and end to his killing spree that he is now addicted to since he cannot jog anymore. But Mark can't do it. David then subdues Mark and locks him and Teresa in his workshop and goes to the school, where a student-alumni dance is taking place. David hides a large bomb in the basement of the school and plots to blow up the dance with all the remaining students and teachers inside the gym.Mark and Teresa manage to break out of David's workshop room and head over to the school. Realizing that the only way to stop David is by playing on his last sympathies he has towards them, they enter the gym where they party is being held and begin to dance. David sees them and tries to get them to leave the building before the bomb goes off. The refuse and dance, saying that if David really wants to kill everyone in the school, he will have to kill them too. Realizing that they will not leave and that both Mark and Teresa are sorrowfully willing to sacrifice their lives for him, David rushes (not very fast because of his limp) to the basement and retrieves the bomb. He takes it outside where it explodes killing him, and blasting out all the windows in the school and gym. Mark and Teresa agree to tell the police that the missing Spoony had planted the bomb and that David had given his life to save everyone."

Stay Hungry,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075268/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"So-called 'special agent' infiltrates into the gym, which is targeted by a dirty business fraud. A syndicate wants to buy a whole district to rebuild it. They've bought every house except the small gym ""Olympic"", where Mr. Austria Joe Santo prepares for the Mr. Universum championships a month ahead. The rich sunny-boy Craig Blake is brought in by the syndicate as a dummy to buy the gym. But then he starts to like the people and falls in love with Joe's friend Mary Tate.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a young Southern man born of a wealthy family in Birmingham, Alabama, but left lonely and idle after his parents died in a plane crash. He is content to spend his time fishing, hunting and puttering around his large family mansion, inhabited only by himself and an elderly butler named William (Scatman Crothers). Craig's ""job"" is a sinecure working at a shady investment firm run by a slick con artist named Jabo (Joe Spinell) and he does very little actual work. But since Craig has to have his name ""on paper"" somehow as an employee, he is asked by Jabo to personally transact the purchasing of a small gym that the real estate firm is buying in order to clear space for an office high-rise.Craig initially approaches the gym, called Olympic Spa, representing himself as a businessman looking to buy it, and acts relatively impersonal with its staff, one of whom includes trainer Franklin (Robert Englund), although he is strangely fascinated with the world he discovers there (reflecting the expansion of physical exercise to the mainstream which occurred in the 1970s). But Craig's primary social life is centered around the upscale country club he attends.Later, the audience is introduced to the ritzy country club crowd, including the WASP-y Lester (Ed Begley, Jr.) and the roguish rake Halsey (John David Carson). Craig Blake spends his time at this club with his friends playing tennis and shooting poker dice, and flirting with the upper-class women of all ages - one of whom asks Craig to find an ""authentic"" musical guest for an upcoming party at the club.As Craig moves forward with his business deal, he falls in love with the gym after visiting it several times - he is immediately taken by the pretty receptionist Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) and the free-spirited, friendly Austrian bodybuilder Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who aspires to win the Mr. Universe title. He cannot bring himself to sell out his newfound friends at the gym for the sake of his job, and so he evades the inquiries of his friend and co-worker Hal Foss as to his progress in the purchasing deal. All the while, he grows closer to Mary Tate and Joe Santo - who initially appear to be a couple. However, Mary Tate latches onto Craig romantically - and Santo gives Craig his blessing for this unorthodox relationship, claiming that he needs to keep himself challenged both in the gym and in his romantic life in order to succeed.Mary Tate and Craig begin a passionate and exciting relationship. But trouble erupts when he tries to integrate Mary Tate into his country-club scene. This tension comes to a head at a party at the country club, which features Joe Santo as a musical guest, performing bluegrass songs on the violin with a small country group. Craig, with Mary Tate as his guest (dressed inappropriately in a garish and revealing pink dress), is enthusiastic about Joe Santo's upcoming musical performance for the night. But Craig's friends, particularly Halsey, mock Santo as a ""freak"" and an outcast. When Halsey suggest that Santo disrobe and show the crowd his ""tits,"" Craig throws a glass of Scotch in his face and tells Halsey that Santo could ""crush him like an eggshell."" A fight nearly breaks out between the two, but is broken up. Meanwhile a bitter Halsey and his friend Packman formulate a plan to embarrass Santo.When Santo's musical act is finally put on stage, the crowd seems enthusiastic about the music, though the hostess of the party dismisses it as a ""racket."" However, Halsey and Packman drunkenly bellow at Santo and heckle the band. Santo notices it, but stoically continues playing. However, when Halsey screams ""let's hear it for Muscle Beach symphony orchestra!"" Santo is unable to continue playing, puts down his violin and leaves the party. Meanwhile a frustrated Craig tries to convince Mary Tate to see him for who he really is, and not for his snobbish friends and ritzy surroundings.The Mr. Universe contest is approaching fast and Santo is training hard. But Jabo attempts to bribe the owner of the gym, Thor Eriksen (R.G. Armstrong), when he realizes that Craig will not purchase the building as he was supposed to. He plies Eriksen and his assistant Newton with drugs, booze and hookers, and on the day of the contest, they are busy with acts of debauchery as Santo is readying to take the stage - hoping to beat his rival Dougie Stewart (played by fellow bodybuilder Ken Waller in a memorable cameo). While Thor is drunk and distracted with the prostitutes, Newton secretly stashes the prize money inside his handbag, and then leaves the gym with the prostitutes when they are finished - stealing the money and fleeing. Meanwhile, Joe Santo and Dougie Stewart pose together on stage, to the theme song from the film 'Exodus' and the enthusiastic applause of the crowd.Meanwhile, Craig visits at the gym and engages in an intense physical fight, dodging weights and gym equipment thrown by the drunken and drug-crazed Eriksen. He finds Mary Tate at the gym, who had just moments earlier been assaulted by Eriksen in an amyl nitrite fueled rage.When the contestants at the Mr. Universe show discover that the prize money has been stolen, they run after Joe Santo, who himself is actually running to try to meet Mary Tate. The chase results in the wave of bodybuilders pouring out into the streets of Birmingham, to the amazed crowd of onlookers which sees them. The bodybuilders take advantage of this unexpected attention to put on an impromptu posing routine for the crowd, and the members of the crowd join in, imitating the athletes' poses and enjoying themselves - an embracing of the bodybuilding lifestyle by 'normal' people which arguably represents the real-life 1970s boom of personal fitness.The film ends with Craig sarcastically deriding Jabo and his former bosses at the real-estate firm, and deciding to go into the gym business with Joe Santo. A voice-over by his uncle Albert says, ""you may not have been the Blake that we anticipated, but you are definitely Craig Blake - an identity that no one will dare challenge."" Craig has finally ""found himself"" and discovered a true place in the sun, and true friendships, and he mocks his former boss Jabo with an exaggerated bodybuilding pose - acting as a final burning of the bridge between his old life and his new one. The final shot of the film shows Craig moving out of his family's mansion, passing on all of his old family memorabilia to his loyal butler William, and leaving behind his old self once and for all... on the way to a new and exciting future."

Lonnie tries to be friendly towards Duane/Abdulla, but the young and angry black Muslim refuses to talk to or confide in Lonnie either about what is bothering him.As the men work, they dance to disco music, but the radio show is interrupted by a news bulletin announcing the threat of a ""pop bottle bomber,"" who fashions soda bottles into bombs and blows up small businesses. Meanwhile, Irwin, who just smoked a marijuana cigarette, informs his father, ""Mr. B,"" that he wants to join his ""exploited brothers"" washing cars, but Irwin slips, goes through the car wash, and gets a hot wax treatment.When the radio promises concert tickets to the first caller to correctly identify a song, T.C. rushes to the telephone booth, but he does not have a dime to make the call. As he screams in frustration, a Mercedes automobile arrives with a boy vomiting out the window. The mother (Lorraine Gary) tells Chuco to wash the car, as she drags the boy to the ladies' room.

As he counts the cash, Duane enters with a revolver, demanding the money, but Lonnie refuses, explaining that he will not allow Duane to go to prison for such a small sum. Duane is unable to shoot Lonnie and cries that he is unable to deal with life's pressures.

Squirm,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075261/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A storm causes some power lines to break and touch the ground, drawing millions of man-eating worms out of the earth, and into town where they quickly start munching on the locals. In Fly Creek, a storm knocks down the power lines, transforming worms in mutant creatures. Mick travels from New York to meet his girlfriend Geri Sanders and stays at her home with her mother Naomi Sanders and her sister Alma Sanders. On the arrival, Mick has a friction with Sheriff Jim Reston and with Geri's neighbor Roger Grimes that woos her. Soon they find that Fly Creek is infested of carnivorous worms that are devouring the inhabitants, but Sheriff Reston believes it is a prank of Mick.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil As a violent storm hammers the sleepy fishing town of Fly Creek, Georgia, a sudden gust of wind topples a massive overhead power line, plunging the entire area to darkness. As a result, an uncontrollable power surge of thousands of volts electrocutes the subterranean colonies of local worms, giving birth to an unstoppable army of ravenous slimy earthworms hungry for the succulent human flesh. Now, it's nature's time to take revenge on the human species, as wave after wave of crawling predators devour everything in their path. Is there an escape from the plague of the killer worms?—Nick Riganas At the beginning of the film, we learn from one of the characters that earthworms can be called to the surface with electricity, but somehow it turns them into vicious flesh-eaters. Sure enough, a storm that night causes some power lines to break and touch the ground, drawing millions of man-eating worms out of the earth, and into town where they quickly start munching on the locals.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> On the early morning hours on September 29, 1975, in Fly Creek, a small town near the coast in Georgia, a powerful electrical storm rages one night. The high winds topple large high-voltage power lines, and the wires drag and snake along the wet, muddy ground.The next morning, Geri Sanders (Patricia Pearcy) awaits the arrival of her new beau, Mick (Don Scardino), a city boy she met at an antique show while vacationing in New York City. Mick arrives on a bus that is forced to turn back due to a large tree that the storm has knocked down across the road. Instead, Mick chooses to walk through the woods, where Geri is amused to find him sunken into a mud hole.Geri lives with her mother, Mrs. Sanders, and her younger sister, Alma. Alma is jealous of the attention Mick gives Geri, and tries her hardest to appear more cultured and stylish, since she thinks Mick will respond to this being from the city. Also jealous of Geri's relationship with Mick is Roger Grimes (R.A. Dow), a slightly backwards neighbor who adores Geri. Roger has loaned Geri his father's truck to go and fetch Mick, and there is an immediate problem: Roger's father is a ""worm farmer"", collecting thousands of worms to sell as bait. The crated worms, which were in the back of the truck, are now missing, the crates empty. Mr. Grimes blames Roger, but Roger knows he loaned the truck to Geri. Roger blames Mick, the interloper who has designs on Geri.The electricity is still out in the area; Mrs. Sanders asks Geri and Mick to fetch a large block of ice for the refrigerator, and while they are in town, Mick stops into a diner. When he orders an ""egg cream"", the waitress has no idea what he wants, but she does her best to prepare the drink the way he describes it. Mick is shocked when he finds a worm in the drink, spilling it all over the counter. The waitress is furious, and Mick scolds her for serving him a drink with a worm in it; however, the worm has disappeared. The local redneck Sheriff overhears the outburst and makes a thinly veiled threat to Mick for ""being disruptive"". The locals obviously distrust Mick because he is from the city.Back at home, Mrs. Sanders is clearly spooked by the storm and the subsequent damage. She remains aloof and seemingly in her own world, and Geri admits that she has been that way ever since Geri's father passed away months earlier. The water service has been interrupted, too, and the shower does not work.Geri takes Mick to visit the local antiques dealer, Mr. Beardsley, but he is nowhere to be found, his home mysteriously abandoned. Mick and Geri are shocked to find a skeleton in the flower garden behind his home. They run and fetch the Sheriff, but when they return with him, the skeleton is gone. The Sheriff is furious, thinking Mick is trying to make a fool out of him, and scolding Geri for being involved in a prank.Later, Mick and Geri go fishing with Roger, and while he is unaware, they discover the missing skeleton in the back of his truck. Mick and Geri don't say anything about it to him. While they are out on the boat, one of the large sandworms they use for bait bites Mick on the arm. Geri explains that the worms in the area bite with sharp, pincer-like jaws, but the wound on Mick's arm is quite bloody. Geri admits she's never seen a worm bite like that, but Roger says he has. He tells Mick and Geri that when he was a child, his father used Roger's electric train transformer in an experiment to see if they could jolt worms out of wet soil with electricity. The experiment worked, but the worms were extremely volatile when they emerged, biting half of Roger's thumb off.Mick has Roger take him back to shore and leaves Geri alone with him on the boat so that he can examine the skeleton. While he is in the truck, Alma appears and startles him. Together they remove the skull from the skeleton and take it to the local dentist's office, where they break in. Mick is convinced the skull belongs to Beardsley himself and that he has been murdered, and he confirms this through Beardsley's dental records. How he was reduced to a skeleton, however, remains a mystery, and furthermore why Roger had took the skeleton and hid it in the back of his truck.Meanwhile, back on the boat, Geri and Roger are alone and Roger makes a pass at Geri. When she rebuffs him, Roger is furious and they struggle. Geri knocks him over right onto the worms, which have overturned their small container and have slithered across the floor of the boat. Geri is horrified when Roger turns over, the worms attached to his face, and she sees them burrowing under his skin. They both fall out of the boat and into the water, where Roger runs off screaming into the woods, leaving Geri alone. Geri returns home in a panic and tries not to alert the fragile Mrs. Sanders that anything is wrong. In an attempt to shower off the dirt from the lake, Geri discovers that the water is still not working; as she fiddles with the knobs, she does not see that directly above her, worms have begun to emerge from the showerhead. They dangle from the large nozzle openings, then retreat mysteriously.Mick and Alma return home and Geri finds out that the skull belongs to Mr. Beardsley. Geri is horrified and upset; she also tells them what happened to Roger. The insane Mrs. Sanders appears suddenly and starts to realize something is wrong, but nobody will tell her anything out of fear of upsetting her.Mick goes to the Grimes farm to see what happened to Roger, and he finds the body of Mr. Grimes. Thinking the old man had a heart attack, Mick puts his ear to Grime's shirt and hears a strange sound. Pulling the shirt open, he is horrified to see thousands of worms eating Grimes from the inside out.When Mick returns to Geri, they deduce that Beardsley must have been killed by worms during the storm. They realize that Roger seems to have discovered the skeleton and taken it, mistaking it for one of Beardsley's antiques. They make one last attempt to convince the Sheriff, who is eating a spaghetti dinner with his girlfriend at a local restaurant. Skeptic, he angrily sends them away, threatening to arrest them.Mick and Geri return home for dinner, when a large tree suddenly topples, crashing through the ceiling of the dining room. Nobody is hurt, but the side of the house is now ripped open and exposed. Mick goes around to the base of the tree and finds the upended root covered in worms. When he goes to get gasoline to burn them, he returns to find them gone. He deduces that what is driving the worms back is the light; it is still daylight, and light seems to keep the worms at bay. With the damage to the house, Mick goes off to find plywood to board up the openings; he knows that once the sun goes down, the worms will be free to attack once again. Geri sends him in the direction of an old mill that was torn down, but when he goes there he is attacked by Roger, who is now demented and behaving like an animal. He hurls Mick into a ditch and knocks him unconscious, leaving him for the worms that he knows will come.Back at the house, Alma attempts to take a shower but also finds the water is still off. She does not realize the pipes are full of worms. Unlike Geri, she leaves the faucet open, and after she leaves, worms begin falling out of the showerhead. Eventually the showerhead breaks off completely, and a steady stream of worms gushes into the bathroom, which is now filling up with the things.Roger, still with worms in his face, lurks outside the house in the falling darkness, while Mrs. Sanders begins to behave strangely, indicating that she's losing her grip on reality. When she sends Geri into the kitchen for something, Roger appears and grabs her. Mrs. Sanders and Alma aren't aware that he's in the house, and Mrs. Sanders mentions that she hears water running in the bathroom. Alma remembers she left the faucet on, and goes upstairs. But when she opens the bathroom door, a sea of worms pours out of the room into the hallway.Other residents of Fly Creek are attacked by millions of worms. The Sheriff and his girlfriend, who are having sex in an empty jail cell, are consumed by a flood of worms, as are the patrons of the local bar.Mick regains consciousness and finds himself surrounded by pools of worms. He saves himself by making a torch out of his shirt and fending them off with the light. When he goes back to the house, he finds worms pouring all around the place, covering the floor. They shy away from Mick's torch, allowing him to enter the house, where he finds the body of what used to be Mrs. Sanders, covered in writhing worms. Going upstairs in search of Alma and Geri, Mick is attacked by Roger, who emerges from the attic. He has kidnapped Geri and tied her up, keeping her hostage in the attic room. Mick drops his torch in the struggle; no longer able to fend off the worms, he cannot go back downstairs, and by now the entire downstairs of the house is literally engulfed in a sea of worms that almost reach the ceiling. When Roger tries to push him into the worms, Mick manages to throw him in instead, and the worms pull Roger underneath of them.Mick unties Geri and they attempt to climb out of an upstairs window into a tree. Roger, however, has emerged from the sea of worms, crawling like a worm himself. He attacks Mick, who beats him to death with a flashlight. Mick and Geri escape into the tree.The next morning, they awaken in the tree branch to find the sun has risen and driven the worms away. A representative from the electric company tells them the power is back on and the towers have been repaired; he remarks that the town seems deserted. Inside the house, a large steamer trunk opens and Alma emerges, still alive; she apparently managed to get inside before the worms engulfed her. Mick and Geri are ecstatic that she has survived, and they run inside to greet her."

But all that accomplishes is to get the killer after him.—Alfred Jingle George Caldwell is an overworked author, taking the ""Silver Streak"" from Los Angeles to Chicago.

Then, out of the blue, George catches a glimpse of a murdered man outside his window, and even though no one believes him, the unsuspecting traveller finds himself entangled in a dangerous conspiracy. But, before long, bullets start flying, and now, George is framed for murder. Under those circumstances, is there more to lovely Hilly than meets the eye? Above all, can Caldwell get to the bottom of this intricate mystery and clear his name?—Nick Riganas George Caldwell is taking a slow restful trip to Chicago on the Silver Streak. Or so he thinks. He's involved in a love affair, a murder, is thrown from the train, wanted by the police, and joins forces with a car thief to re-board the train to save his love.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) is a divorced and mild-mannered book editor that wants to relax and take a train to Chicago for the next 2 days so he can ""be bored for a while"". Shortly after getting on the train, he meets a friendly vitamin salesman named Bob Sweet (Ned Beatty). Not long afterward, a woman named Hilly Burns (Jill Clayburgh) wants to have dinner with him. He accidentally barged into her compartment next door to his while she was disrobing. The two of them share over 2 bottles of champagne together and stay in the diner until closing. Hilly is working as a secretary for a Professor Schreiner, a semi-reclusive history professor that is about to give a speech at a university.Briefly we see a small group of thugs beating up a bearded man. George and Hilly retire for the night and make love. Just as she is caressing him, he sees a man fall from the roof of his window off the train. George reacts in horror and Hilly believes he drank too much and hallucinating.George wakes up the next day and finds a book and shows Hilly the photo on the back cover of it, who was the bearded man he saw murdered last night. Hilly says that's Professor Schreiner and still refuses to believe George. She tells him where his compartment is so George can see himself that he's okay.George passes by Bob Sweet in the dining area, who wants to have breakfast with him, but George says he'll be right back to join him. He knocks on the door of Professor Schreiner's compartment and a sinister looking 60-ish man with a cigarette in his mouth (Ray Walston) answers the door. George says he wants to see the professor and the man tells him he's sticking his nose where it doesn't belong and that he and Hilly are in trouble. George refuses to comply and tries to let himself in. The man tells Reace (Richard Kiel, Jaws in the James Bond movies), a thuggish seven foot tall man that doesn't speak, to get rid of George and without hesitation, Reace opens a door and throws George off the train.George is somewhere in Arizona or New Mexico and frustrated at having been thrown off the train being stuck in the middle of a desert. He finds a farm in the middle of the desert and meets an eccentric, but very warm and friendly old woman named Rita Babtree (Lucille Benson). She takes George to her single engine crop duster airplane and gives him the thrill of his life a ride in the plane to the next town. He was going to give the local sheriff information about the incident he's witnessed, but by the time they arrive at the train depot, the train is already taking off. George runs to the train and the convention crowd in the back catch him and get him on. They are now approaching the Rocky Mountains on their journey.George is back on the train. It is now lunchtime and he sees Hilly in the dining compartment with an elegant looking man having lunch with her. Bob Sweet encounters George telling him he wanted to have George join him for breakfast, but now it's lunch. George confesses he was ""squeezing tits"", which he did when he was at Rita's farm milking a cow and Bob jokes with him about being a horny devil. He tells George that man Hilly is having lunch with is Roger Devereau (Patrick McGoohan), a millionaire art dealer in Chicago.George is now back in his compartment, then opens the door to Hilly's and she tells him she was worried about him, embraces him, and that what he witnessed was a hallucination. Devereau comes into Hilly's compartment and introduces himself to George apologizing about the incident with him being thrown off the train. Edgar Whiney, the sinister looking man George encountered at Professor Schreiner's compartment is surprised to see George and blames Reace for throwing George off. Then a bearded man (Stefan Gierasch) comes into the compartment telling Deverau the papers have been found. He introduces himself as Professor Schreiner. He tells them he is tired from the stress of the searching for the missing papers and will rest and have a scotch. George apologizes for intruding into their business affairs and goes back into his compartment. Whiney snickers and Devereau slaps Hilly across the face afterwards.George is in the bar and getting drunk. Bob Sweet comes back in acting like he assumes George is having woman problems. George tells him about what has happened since last night, Bob keeps asking him questions about the people he's dealt with, George is perplexed as to why Bob is asking him all these questions and tells him Schreiner was met just a little while ago and wanted to have a scotch and lie down. It turns out Bob Sweet is actually Stevens, a federal agent.Stevens tells George he's been working on a case for the past 2 years tailing Roger Devereau to get him arrested. In actuality, Schreiner despises Devereau and wants nothing to do with him and a health food nut that doesn't touch alcohol and that the man claiming to be Schreiner is an imposter. He assures George that Schreiner has been murdered and he didn't hallucinate. Stevens takes George to a storage compartment that Schreiner was probably confronted at, then the top of the train. Stevens walks over to an area that's above George's compartment and finds a piece of torn clothing. George realizes he was right. Stevens knows Devereau murdered Schreiner over something, because Schreiner was going to give a speech about some letters that were going to prove Devereau's art in his gallery were forgeries. George realizes that ""Rembrandt letters"" were mentioned by the imposter earlier. George and Stevens go back into his compartment and gets a book he saw earlier with actual manuscripts Rembrant himself wrote over 300 years ago. Stevens is amazed at what he found and that the letters will bring down Deverau's art gallery business declaring him a fraud. He also mentions Devereau had a plane crash in Cologne, Germany two years before killing over 100 people to cover up an art scandal. He tells George to push a button for the porter and to have the train stop in Dodge City to have Devereau arrested. A knock is on the door, Stevens answers, then everything goes dark and shots fired. Stevens has been shot and knows George was the intended target because of his knowledge and to take his gun. He dies from the wounds.The porter (Scatman Crothers) comes to George's compartment and outraged George shot Stevens. George storms out and tells him he didn't do it. Whiney sees George and surprised he's not dead. Reace sees George, shoots at him, then tries to tail him. Reace looks for him in the storage compartment, then at the top of the train. George confronts him and shoots him off. Shortly afterwards, George encounters a railway signal, bumping into it, holding on, then falling off once again.George is now off the train once again in Colorado and gets a ride to the sheriff's office in a small town. He meets a fat hayseed Sheriff named Chaunsey (Clifton James). George is rattled and tries to tell Chauncey his story, because the sheriff has never dealt with a murder before. Chanuncey is befuddled by the story, but then gets a phone call. It turns out a federal agent is on the phone wanting George for murder and Chaunsey is surprised and finds George a bit nutty. Chauncey confronts George and pulls a gun on him. George pulls the gun from the sheriff declaring him for being incompetent and that he's trying to save a life. His deputy pulls up in a police vehicle and George hijacks it pointing a gun at Chauncey and the deputy.George is in the police vehicle driving and a handcuffed man in the backseat gets up and startles him. The man is Grover Muldoon (Richard Pryor), a slick and charming car thief impressed at the way George handled the situation. George tells Grover what he's accused of, but Grover wants to be dropped off and doesn't ""deal with the big M"". But they stay together. Grover takes the wheel knowing they will be setting up roadblocks on the Kansas state line and crashes into the cars escaping the police.Hilly is on the train in her compartment and Devereau is questioning her about her involvement with George and she swears they just met, but Devereau assures her, they will take care of her in the meantime until they see George again.George and Grover are at a used car lot attempting to steal a Jaguar. A night watchman pulls a gun on Grover for attempting to steal it, then George tackles the man to the ground knocking him out. Grover assures him they'll make it in time to Kansas City in the early morning to get George back on the Silver Streak. The entire time driving George is worried if Hilly is still alive.George and Grover arrive at the train terminal in Kansas City. They discover federal agents are at the ticket counter and George is on the front cover of a newspaper wanted for murder. In the movie's most famous and hilarious scene ever, Grover takes George under his wing and purchases a hat, radio, and brown shoe polish from a shoe shiner. Grover's intention is to make George pass as a black man. He's having trouble as George is having difficulty with the rhythm of the blues music and dancing very much like a white man. George is now wearing Grover's purple sport jacket, the shoeshiner's hat, brown shoe polish on his face, and sunglasses. He comes out of the men's room looking and acting downright ridiculous and Grover hopes no Muslims are there to see them. Grover is asked by one of the agents if he's seen the white man wanted and Grover replies, ""No, but if I see any, I'll let you know"". George makes it past them and on the train.George goes into his compartment to discover all his personal effects are gone. Grover tells George to give him some cash for him to wear a porter's uniform. George is getting fed up with giving up his money for disguises, but does it anyway. He rinses his face off, then finds Hilly in his compartment. George is knocked out cold, then wakes up a little while later. Hilly comforts him and tells him that she had no choice but to accept Devereau's plan that Schreiner was killed or else she was going to be killed, too. George had the Rembrandt letters in his jacket pocket and they were taken. The two embrace and are just glad to be back together. Edgar Whiney comes into his compartment pulls out a gun and tells George and Hilly Devereau wants to see them.George and Hilly meet with Devereau in his compartment to join him for breakfast. Devereau is reviewing the letters and loves their historical authenticity, then gives them to Whiney to put in a safe. He tells George that Professor Schreiner actually killed himself and jumped off the train and that they were actually going to kill him later, but because he refused to cooperate and give them the Rembrandt letters, it messed up their plans. Johnson, the man who played the false Professor Schreiner, comes in the compartment now without glasses, a beard, and foreign accent. It turns out he's an employee of Devereau's and another dangerous man. He tells Devereau they will land in Rockdale within 1 1/2 hours, which is where they plan to get off at instead of Chicago, then leaves. Devereau now very calmly tells George and Hilly that there will be a new scenario that they kill each other in 45 minutes. The porter arrives with toast, marmalade, and coffee. It turns out Grover is playing the role of a porter. Grover jokes around with and annoys Devereau about how ""we aims to please"" and ""ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine"", then pretends to accidentally pour coffee in Devereau's lap with Devereau calling Grover ""an ignorant nigger"". Grover pulls a gun on him threatening him, then George pulls Devereau's gun from his jacket. George now declares to Devereau that man he had shot was a federal agent and they've been tailing him for the past 2 years. He tells Devereau to go back to the safe and get the Rembrandt letters. George points a gun at Whiney to get the letters out, but Johnson shoots at George and Grover. George and Grover leave the train. This is the third time George has left the train.George and Grover land in a pond right off the train and apprehended by local authorities. Devereau is now burning the Rembrandt letters in his compartment and Johnson gets back on the train after making a phone call. Their plan is to make the remainder of their trip to Rockdale with no further delays and to get off quietly.George and Grover are brought to the local police station, but not handcuffed. The local chief (Len Birman) tells George that he knows he's innocent of murder, but he was put on the newspaper for his own protection and that they've been trying to pick him up. Grover pretends he's all shaken up from what's happened and wants to go home. George is given a gun to help the authorities out and save Hilly. They plan to stop the train off at an undisclosed location before Rockdale and get everybody off so they can arrest Devereau.The train stops and all passengers are let off at Harris Mill Junction. Devereau and his men refuse to cooperate and shoot at the chief and his crew. Grover joins George in the gunfight. Whiney gets shot and Devereau refuses to let him get back on the train. Devereau has Hilly and makes the engineer get the train going at full speed. George and Grover get back on. While Devereau is trying to fight off the police helicopter crew, George kills Johnson and rescues Hilly. Devereau kills the engineer who tries to escape, then puts a heavy toolbox on the pedal. George disconnects a rear car from the train and he, Grover, Hilly, and the porter are now safe. Devereau is shot by the police twice in the helicopter, then decapitated by an oncoming train.The Silver Streak is now a runaway train and all folks at the terminal are ordered to evacuate the area. The train crashes through a cement wall destroying a gift shop, and much of the station. Grover drives away in a stolen Triumph sports car that was on display in the lobby and George and Hilly walk off and want to find a park to stay in."

Morgan and his friends are on a hunting trip on a remote Canadian island when they are attacked by a swarm of giant wasps. Looking for help, Morgan stumbles across a barn inhabited by an enormous killer chicken. After doing some exploring, they discover the entire island is crawling with animals that have somehow grown to giant size. The most dangerous of all of these, however, are the rats, who are mobilizing to do battle with the human intruders.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, Morgan (Marjo Gortner), a professional football player, and his friend Brian (Jon Cypher), are on a ferry heading to an island for a few days' rest. Morgan remembers his father saying that someday nature will rebel against man for what man has done to it.Meeting up with their teammate, Davis (Chuck Courtney), they all go deer hunting on horseback. Morgan corners a deer, then lets it go. Davis rides after it. Deep in the forest, Davis' horse spooks and throws him to the ground. He hears a loud buzzing noise and looks up to see wasps the size of buzzards. Morgan and Brian find Davis' swollen, dead body, and Brian stays with the corpse while Morgan rides to a farmhouse to ask for help. Mrs. Skinner (Ida Lupino), a farmer in her late fifties, sees him coming and runs into her house. Morgan knocks on the door, but gets no answer. Hearing a loud flapping sound, Morgan goes into the barn and sees six-foot tall chickens. The rooster attacks and Morgan kills it with a pitchfork.Appearing in the kitchen window, Mrs. Skinner tells him he had no right to go into the barn. Morgan explains his friend is dead and he needs a phone. She says she does not have a phone, but asks him in to look at some holes in the wall. She thinks rats may have gotten in and eaten the chicken feed. Morgan sees a bowl containing a paste-like substance. Mrs. Skinner explains that it comes from the ground and makes animals gigantic. He watches a wasp eat the food and tells Mrs. Skinner that it is dangerous, but she says God gave it to her and Mr. Skinner because they are good people. She tells him that Mr. Skinner is in the city to sell it and make them rich.Morgan and Brian leave the island. Afraid people will think they are crazy, they decide to let the coroner figure out what killed Davis.On the night ferry, Mr. Skinner asks a ferryman if anyone has seen anything really big on the island. Meanwhile, Mrs. Skinner hears glass breaking in the kitchen and finds some canning jars overturned. As she cleans up the mess, two-foot-long worms bite her hand.As Mr. Skinner drives home, he gets a flat tire. When he gets out to fix it, a pack of giant rats rush out and eat him alive.The next day, Brian tells Morgan the coroner's conclusion that Davis had to have been stung by over two hundred wasps to account for the amount of toxin he had in his body. Morgan insists that they go back.On the island, Rita (Belinda Balaski), a pregnant woman, and her boyfriend, Thomas (Tom Stovall), have gotten their recreational vehicle stuck in the mud. Jack Bensington (Ralph Meeker), a businessman, and Lorna Scott (Pamela Franklin), a bacteriologist, drive by, and although Rita tries to flag them down, Bensington is too busy to stop.At the farm, Bensington and Lorna find the giant chickens torn to pieces, but Bensington thinks the chickens are fakes. They meet Mrs. Skinner and are told Mr. Skinner has yet to return. She then shows them a white fluid oozing from a rock. Mrs. Skinner explains that nothing will eat the fluid unless it is mixed with food, and it does not affect adult animals, only their offspring.Morgan and Brian spot Rita and Thomas while driving on the island, and the couple tells Morgan about seeing rats the size of horses. Morgan wants the two to come with him, but they want to stay with the RV and ask Morgan to pick them up on the way back. When Morgan and Davis get to the farm, they see Bensington fighting off giant wasps with a shovel. After they shoot and kill some of the wasps, Bensington tells them to leave, saying he owns the fluid; however, Mrs. Skinner says no one owns it until Mr. Skinner says they do. Morgan explains he is only there to destroy the wasps' nest. Davis and Morgan find the nest and blow it up with a homemade bomb. Mrs. Skinner runs up and tells them Lorena has fallen down a rat hole.Taking his shotgun, Morgan goes down the hole, but it caves in before he can rescue Lorna. Brian finds another rat hole and asks Bensington to go in with him, but Bensington calls him a fool. Morgan fights off three rats, but runs out of shotgun shells. Another giant rat attacks, and Brian appears, shooting it in the head. As they come out of the tunnel, Rita and Thomas run up to say rats are attacking their RV. Bensington wants to drive right through the rats, but Morgan tells everyone to stay put. Scouting out the situation, Morgan and Brian find a pack of rats ripping the RV into pieces.Returning to the farm, Morgan discovers a fence that runs across the island with water on both sides. Brian says the fence will not hold the rats, but Morgan gets a generator to electrify it. Brian then points out that rats swim, but Morgan thinks they cannot as they have grown too big.At the farm, Bensington scoops the fluid into all the containers he can find. Lorena asks him to help Rita, who is in pain, but Bensington ignores her, saying the fluid has stopped running and is drying up. The fence electrocutes some rats, and the remainder jumps into the water and drowns. Brian is ecstatic until Morgan says that not all the rats went into the water. They then realize the rats have short-circuited the fence with a tree. Before they can escape, the rats attack. Morgan fights a rat barehanded until he grabs a shotgun and kills it. He then watches in horror as rats devour Brian. Morgan jumps into the jeep and takes off.When Morgan gets back to the farm, Bensington asks if Brian ran off. Morgan goes berserk and smashes all the containers of the fluid. As the rats approach, everyone runs into the house except for Bensington, who tries to salvage some of the fluid. The rats tear him apart. After a prolonged attack, the rats pull back, just out of shotgun range. Thomas believes a white rat is the leader.During the lull in the siege, Lorna helps Morgan make bombs from black powder and gasoline. They kiss, and although she wants to make love, Morgan insists they wait until they get back to the mainland.The rats renew the attack. Throwing a bomb, Morgan clears a path to the jeep. As he and Thomas jump in and speed away, the rats swarm the house, chewing through the wood. Mrs. Skinner kills a rat with a meat cleaver, but not before it tears her throat out. Lorena and Rita barricade themselves in the bedroom. Rita goes into labor and Lorna delivers the baby.Meanwhile, Morgan and Thomas blow up a dam. Outracing the floodwaters, they rush to the house, fight their way back in and lead everyone upstairs to a small balcony. The flood hits and drowns all the rats except the white one. Out of ammunition, Morgan clubs the white rat to death with his rifle. When the waters recede, Thomas and Morgan pile the rats up and burn them. A few open jars of the fluid float downstream and go into a pond where cows are drinking. The cows are then milked and the milk is brought to a grade school where children drink it."

The medium Madam Blanche Tyler is engaged by the elderly millionaire Julia Rainbird who believes she is a spiritualist. After a séance, Blanche discovers that Julia is tormented by her past, when she forced her sister and unmarried mother Harriet to deliver her baby for adoption to avoid a family scandal. Julia promises the small fortune of ten thousand-dollars to Blanche if she finds her nephew and heir of her fortune using her physic powers. Blanche and her boyfriend George Lumley, who is an unemployed actor working as cab driver, investigate the whereabouts of Julia's nephew. Meanwhile, the greedy jeweler Arthur Adamson kidnaps wealthy people with his girlfriend Fran and requests diamonds for the ransom. When George's investigations conclude that Arthur Adamson might be the heir of Julia Rainbird, the reckless Blanche gets in trouble with the kidnappers.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Wealthy and aged Julia Rainbird wants to bequeath her vast fortune to her only presumed living heir, her illegitimate nephew, who was given away as a baby and as such whose whereabouts and identity she does not know. Rather than go to a private investigator to locate him, a P.I. who would use public means to do his work, Julia instead enlists the more discreet services of her psychic, Madame Blanche, to locate her nephew, with a payment of $10,000 upon delivery. What Julia is unaware of is that Madame Blanche - really Blanche Tyler - is a charlatan, who uses basic information of her targets often uncovered by her actor/taxi driving boyfriend, George Lumley, to perpetrate the scam. Blanche and George feel this $10,000 is their meal ticket, despite having only scant leads as to the identity and whereabouts of the nephew. Their initial leads indicate that the nephew may in fact be dead... or perhaps not. In reality, the nephew is Arthur Adamson, a jeweler, who, along with his secret associate/girlfriend Fran, have amassed their own small fortune through the theft of gems, largely through kidnapping the gem owners, with the said gems being the ransom paid. Arthur grew up as Edward Shoebridge, the adopted son of friends of the Rainbird's chauffeur. Along with another associate, Edward killed his parents in a house fire twenty-five years ago, and faked his own death in the process, although he had never been declared legally dead since there was no conclusive evidence of such. He assumed his current identity after the fire.

Blanche's falsetto ""trance"" voice becomes a deep growl as she channels her spirit guide, Henry, who indicates a reluctant presence in the room. Julia believes it is her deceased sister, Harriet, who gave birth to an illegitimate son over 40 years earlier. His estrangement from the Rainbirds weighs heavily on Julia's conscience. She offers Blanche $10,000 to locate the missing heir, as a private investigator might draw attention to this family embarrassment. Blanche walks calmly to an awaiting taxi, driven by her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern). Once inside, she tells him that, with the help of Henry, she has secured a lucrative assignment. George reminds her that she is ""as psychic as a dry salami,"" and is guided by his research, not Henry. She dismisses his comments as jealousy, but asks him to continue his investigation of the Rainbirds. George refuses, until Blanche tells him about the $10,000, which puts him in an amorous mood. When he takes his eyes off the road for a few seconds, the car narrowly misses a tall blonde woman dressed in black clothing and wearing dark sunglasses crossing the road after disembarking from a public bus.The woman (Karen Black) enters a police station with a pistol. She is given a large diamond, then hands the detectives a written note, assuring them that her hostage, Victor Constantine, will be returned unharmed. The detectives lead the woman to a helicopter that has had its radio communications removed. She communicates using hand gestures, and when the pilot doubts that her gun is loaded, she shoots a hole through the pilot's window. After the helicopter lands on a golf course, the woman walks to a wooded area, where her male accomplice waits with Constantine (Nicholas Colasanto). The pilot runs to the woods as the kidnappers, Arthur Adamson (William Devane) and his girlfriend Fran, drive away.Inside the car, Fran complains about her six-inch high heels as she removes her hat and blonde wig, but also assures Arthur that she made no mistakes. Arthur smugly reminds her that the police will be looking for a tall blonde woman. He also indicates that he is planning another kidnapping. After returning home, they clean the secret room in the basement that held Constantine. Fran and Arthur find danger to be an aphrodisiac, and before they retire to the bedroom, Arthur hangs the diamond on the crystal chandelier near the staircase, where it will never be noticed. The next day, Constantine is questioned in his office by FBI Agent Sanger (Martin West) and a few police detectives, but is unable to describe the kidnappers.Meanwhile, Blanche gives a psychic reading to Ida Cookson, a close friend of Julia's. George arrives and walks in the back door during the reading. Blanche wants to contact Michael, the Rainbird's deceased chauffeur, who facilitated the adoption of Harriet's son.

Both later died in a house fire, and the son may have died with them.George finds the graves of the three Shoebridges at the Barlow Creek cemetery, all of whom died in 1950 per the two headstones.. He asks the gravedigger why the son's separate stone looks so much newer than that of his parents, and why there are two graves for three people. The gravedigger refuses to answer George's questions and returns to work.George next visits Mr. Wheeler (Charles Tyner), the engraver, who made the stones for the Shoebridges and finds that Eddie's stone was not made until 1965. Wheeler remembers that it was purchased by a tow-truck driver, and that people blamed Eddie for the death of his parents, especially because he disappears and his grave is empty.At the County Registrar's office, George learns that a mechanic named Joseph P. Maloney (Ed Lauter) applied for Eddie's death certificate, which was denied as there was no proof of death.George parks across the road from Maloney's gas station for several minutes before entering. Maloney is openly suspicious, and when George questions him, Maloney admits nothing and copies George's license plate number as he drives away. Later, Maloney appears at Arthur's jewelry store, greeting the jeweler as ""Eddie."" Arthur leads him to the office, assuming that Maloney once again needs money. Maloney informs Arthur of George's visit, and that he has traced the car to Blanche's address. He offers to kill George and Blanche, just as he killed the Shoebridges at Arthur's request 26 years ago. As Arthur declines the offer, he is called away by a pair of police detectives inquiring about the ransom diamond, of which Arthur admits no knowledge. When he returns to his office, Maloney is gone and the window is open.That night, Arthur and Fran drive to Blanche's home, where they overhear George and Blanche arguing about sex, the search for Eddie Shoebridge, and a large sum of money. Fran suggests that the latter might be the reward offered for Constantine's kidnappers.Later, at the Rainbird home, Blanche reveals all of the information George has gathered, with Henry getting the credit. Julia remembers that Bishop Wood (William Prince), who baptized Harriet's child, might have more information.George attends the bishop's Sunday service, as does Fran, disguised as an older woman. She faints in front of the bishop, while Arthur, disguised as a deacon, sedates him. The kidnapping proceeds without interference. In the car, Arthur expresses his lifelong resentment toward the bishop, while congratulating himself on his brilliant plan. They agree that George's presence was no coincidence, and Arthur decides to have Maloney kill George and Blanche, despite Fran's disapproval.That afternoon, Maloney calls George and Blanche, claiming to have information on Eddie Shoebridge. They are to meet him at a diner in a remote, mountainous area. Blanche insists that they go, ignoring George's reservations. They arrive at the diner and wait inside, while Maloney quietly sabotages Blanche's car outside. After several beers, they decide to leave when Maloney fails to show up. As George navigates the car down the winding mountain road, brake fluid leaks from the rear wheels. Blanche panics as George narrowly misses oncoming vehicles and steep cliffs before running the car off the road, where it lands on its side. Neither is injured, although Blanche is standing on George's face. As they walk back up the road, Maloney drives by, offering a ride. George declines, believing that Maloney sabotaged the car. Maloney drives off but quickly returns with the intent of running over George and Blanche. He swerves to avoid an oncoming car, drives off a cliff, and dies in a fiery wreck.The next day, Fran enters Arthur's jewelry store, posing as a customer. She updates him on the bishop's ransom and delivers the news of Maloney's death, which makes Arthur smile. When he demands that she collaborate on the murder of George and Blanche, she is horrified and leaves.At Maloney's funeral, George forces Mrs. Maloney (Kathleen Helmond) to reveal Arthur's true identity. George informs Blanche, who begins her search for the correct Arthur Adamson without his assistance as he has to take a day-long shift at the taxi company. When she arrives at Adamson's Jewelry Store, Blanche convinces Mrs. Clay (Edith Atwater), the clerk, to give her Arthur's home address, which she includes in a note for George.At the Adamson house, Arthur and Fran are about to remove the bishop for the ransom exchange when Blanche rings the doorbell. Believing she has left, they continue their preparations. The garage door opens where Blanche is out on the street, and she excitedly tells Arthur about his inheritance, until Fran opens a car door and reveals the unconscious bishop. Blanche is trapped, and after a struggle, she is sedated and locked in the secret room. The Adamsons, convinced that Blanche's whereabouts are unknown, carry on without concern.A few hours later, while Arthur and Fran drive home with their new diamond, George arrives at the house searching for Blanche. He enters through a basement window and hides when the Adamsons return. George overhears Arthur's plans to stage Blanche's ""suicide,"" despite protests from Fran. He quietly follows Arthur to the basement, where he finds Blanche pretending to still be unconscious after Arthur leaves to make preparations. When Arthur and Fran return for Blanche, she leaps up and escapes and George locks the two kidnappers inside the hidden room. Thrilled as they are about the reward, George is sure that it would be increased if they can locate the diamonds. Blanche goes into a trance and leads George to the diamond hidden in the chandelier, convincing George that she is truly psychic. As George leaves to phone the police and Julia Rainbird, Blanche winks and smiles at the viewers, thus breaking the fourth wall."

He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when the Native American lived there.Two female hikers are breaking camp when one of them is attacked and killed by a bear. The second woman finds apparent safety within a nearby cabin until the bear tears down a wall to reach her. The National Park's Chief Ranger Michael Kelly (Christopher George) and photographer Allison Corwin (Joan McCall), daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a Ranger to the primitive campsite to find the two female hikers. They discover the woman's mangled body inside the destroyed cabin. Allison stumbles across the remains of the first woman while photographing the search.At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the women were killed by a bear. The Park Supervisor Charley Kittridge (Joe Dorsey) blames Kelly, saying the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by he and Naturalist Arthur Scott (Richard Jaeckel) before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, and decide to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who says all bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest.While searching the mountain, a female Ranger decides to go swimming near a waterfall where she is attacked and killed by the bear. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot Stober to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the Naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear and at least 15 feet tall. Kelly and Stober scoff at the notion.At the busy lowland campground, the grizzly tears down a tent and kills a woman. Kelly once again insists on closing the park, but Kittridge refuses. The attacks are becoming a national news story and to counteract this, Kittridge allows amateur hunters into the forest. Kelly, Stober and Scott, now a team, are disgusted by this development. Later, a lone hunter is chased by the bear but he evades the animal on foot, falling into a river and floating to safety. A Ranger at a fire lookout tower on the mountain is attacked by the grizzly, the animal tearing down the structure and killing the Ranger.Kelly and Kittridge continue to argue over closing the park. Frustrated by the politics of the situation, Scott sneaks away to track the grizzly on his own. On the outskirts of the National Park, a mother and child living in a cabin are attacked by the grizzly. The mother is killed and the child survives, but is severely mutilated. Stunned by this development, Kittridge finally allows Kelly to close the park and ban all hunters.Stober and Kelly now go after the elusive grizzly alone, setting up a trap by hanging a deer carcass from a tree. The grizzly goes for the bait and the men chase the animal through the woods. When they return, they discover the grizzly has tricked them and taken the deer carcass. Tracking on horseback, Scott finds the remains of the carcass and calls Stober and Kelly on the radio. He is going to drag the deer behind his horse and create a trap by leading the grizzly towards them. The grizzly surprises Scott, killing his horse and knocking him unconscious. Scott awakens to find himself alive, but half-buried in the ground. The grizzly immediately returns and kills him.Kelly and Stober discover Scott's body and in despair, decide to return to the helicopter to find the grizzly from the air. They immediately spot the bear in a clearing and quickly land. The grizzly attacks the helicopter, swiping the craft causing Stober to be thrown clear. The grizzly kills Stober and then turns on Kelly, who frantically pulls a bazooka from the helicopter. Before the bear can reach him, Kelly fires the bazooka at the grizzly, killing the animal instantly. For several seconds, Kelly sadly stares at the burning remains of the grizzly and then walks towards Stober's body."

There is only one rule for the race: there are no rules. The race was initiated and is organized by Mike and his twenty year best friend and competitor Steve Smith - Smitty - who will this year have as the seconds in their respective vehicles Samuel Graves, a Boston university tenure track Classics professor who is worried about getting caught which would threaten his tenure, and Italian race car driver Franco Bertollini, who arguably has the opposite sex on his mind more than the race. One hopeful new entrant this year is Jose, the car-less gopher at the garage and the race starter, who not only wants to show his overbearing aspiring actress girlfriend Angie that he has a car - a stipulation she has before she will go on anymore dates with him - but also to get her to Hollywood. What happens during the race will be a combination of skill, perseverance, luck, motivation, priorities and a little improvisation on the run.

Who did it? No-one knows or cares, as they're too busy being distracted by busty Margo Winchester, who hitch-hikes into# town and gets involved with all the local men. It all ends with a series of complicated plot twists that reveal that just about everyone is really someone else. And if it gets too confusing, Russ Meyer helpfully arranges for a one- woman nude Greek chorus to pop up at intervals to explain what's going on.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> A man named Adolf Schwartz (Edward Schaaf), who happens to be Adolf Hitler in hiding, is living in a Bavarian-style castle in northern California.

An argument breaks out with the result that Leonard subdues and rapes the unconscious Margo, after that she accidentally kills him. This is witnessed by Homer, but he covers up the incident because Box's wealthy father would put Margo in jail forever and of course he is horny for the busty woman.

The Cassandra Crossing,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074292/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Passengers on a European train have been exposed to a deadly disease. Nobody will let them off the train. So what happens next? ""Outbreak"" meets ""The Runaway Train"" as a motley group of passengers are quarantined on a train destined to prevent the spread of the disease at the cost of their lives. Government intrigue, international smuggling, and the legend of the Cassandra Crossing add to the suspense.—<hgwells@magicnet.net> Terrorists have planted a deadly virus on a transcontinental train. On board are the glamorous Jennifer Chamberlain (Loren) and her ex-husband, Dr Jonathan Chamberlain (Harris). To save Europe from a deadly epidemic, Colonel Stephen Mackenzie (Lancaster) is called in to handle the crisis. He alone must decide whether to re-route the train over the unstable Cassandra Crossing - where it will plunge into oblivion. When the existence of a strain of plague (vaguely identified as pneumonic) is revealed at the US mission at the International Health Organization, three terrorists seek to blow up the US mission. Two of them are shot, one mortally, by security personnel, but one escapes. The surviving terrorist is hospitalized and quarantined, identified as Swedish. Soon after, Dr. Elena Stradner and US military intelligence Colonel Stephen Mackenzie argue over the nature of the strain, which Stradner suspects is a biological weapon but which Colonel Mackenzie claims was in the process of being destroyed.The third terrorist, Eklund, escapes and stows away on a train bound from Geneva to Stockholm. Stradner believes that the train should be stopped so that the terrorist can be removed and quarantined, but Mackenzie is concerned that all of the passengers on the train might be infected. Mackenzie insists on rerouting the train to a disused railway line which goes to a former Nazi concentration camp in Janov, Poland, where the passengers will be quarantined. However, the line crosses a dangerously unsound steel arch bridge known as the Kasundruv Bridge or the ""Cassandra Crossing"", out of use since 1948 (former railway Zagorz-Solina-Turka-Lviv between Poland and Ukraine). Meanwhile, Eklund infects numerous people (and Iago, a pet basset hound in the cargo area) as he wanders the train as a stowaway; Eklund coughs over a bowl of rice that is to be served to guests, he touches a baby, brushes past numerous people, and finally contains himself in a guest's bathroom, desperate for drinking water. The guests in question, a young hippie couple who enjoy singing, catch him in the bathroom and mistake him for a ""sweaty pervert"", unaware that he is carrying a deadly disease.Mackenzie understands that the Cassandra Crossing bridge might collapse as the train passes over it. The presence of the infected terrorist, and the rerouting of the train, precipitates the second conflict among passengers on the train; they include: Jonathan Chamberlain, a famous neurologist - his ex-wife Jennifer Rispoli-Chamberlain - a former inmate of Janov and Holocaust survivor turned watch salesman Herman Kaplan - Max (the conductor) - an elderly nun who likes romance novels - the hippie couple and their fellow bandmates - and Nicole Dressler, the wife of a German arms dealer. She is embroiled in an affair with her gigolo companion, a much younger man and mountain climber named Robby Navarro. Navarro is secretly a heroin trafficker being pursued by Interpol agent Haley, who is travelling undercover as a priest. Haley is desperate not to have his cover blown; unfortunately for him, he shares a car with a spoiled little schoolgirl named Caterina (spelled ""Katerina"" in the English subtitled version), who suspects him immediately of not really being a priest when she sees an anchor tattoo on his arm from a previous navy career. He calls the little girl ""sweets"" as a nickname, which Caterina's nanny finds charming. Caterina considers him a bizarre sort of priest when he doesn't say his prayers at the dinner table that evening.Jennifer, a successful author, plans to publish a tell-all, unauthorized biography of her rocky marriage and divorce, a book that would greatly embarrass Chamberlain if it were released. Still, the two can't bring themselves to stay mad at each other for long; they kiss, only for things to quickly go sour again as Jennifer makes a catty remark about still going through with her publication. Chamberlain scolds her, telling her that he can never be sure whether or not her behavior is genuine. Jennifer goes to open the window for some fresh air, only to see the train passing through its intended station stop, with police at the station platform. She hurries to warn Chamberlain, who is busy discussing his research (regenerating damaged brain cells in mentally retarded children). Dressler, hearing this, comically tells Navarro, ""there's hope for you yet!"", which Navarro doesn't find amusing. Frustrated by the casual banter, Jennifer tells her ex-husband about the police, anyway. Before Chamberlain can respond, he's told that he has an emergency telephone call coming in for him, which he goes to take.Mackenzie informs Chamberlain of the presence of Eklund, who is found, but when attempts are made to remove him via helicopter, they're unsuccessful because the train enters a tunnel, and Eklund is overweight and bloated, thus a struggle even for four people to try to lift out of the train. Stradner insists that the Iago the basset hound, removed via helicopter in a net, not be dumped overboard into the snowy mountains; the dog is instead brought back to the lab for observation, where it falls into a coma quickly afterwards. Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate. Mackenzie, however, lies to passengers via radio that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to Nuremberg. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a US Army medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a hermetically-sealed coffin. Most of the medical team is not made up of doctors, but rather armed military guards.The elderly nun sadly passes away after suffering from chest pains, and Eklund's coffin is hoisted away, which causes another female passenger to panic at the sight of it. Passengers are stunned by how callous the medical team is, watching as they shove around a pregnant woman and confiscate sentimental items and expensive valuables, including Kaplan's suitcase, which contains things like items that he uses for amateur magic tricks to impress children and customers. The guards also threaten to shoot anyone who attempts to flee the train. They shoot Kaplan, who attempts to escape through a safety hatch after confiding in Max about his Holocaust survival (Max had conducted the train as a young man and remembers a concentration camp being on a nearby route); Kaplan is wounded, but survives. Haley attempts to leave out one of the passenger doors, but is threatened that he'll be shot at too if he flees, convincing him to remain aboard.Kaplan begins to suffer a nervous breakdown upon realizing that they're heading for the concentration camp where he was once imprisoned; he finds the whole process of being sealed into a train by force, held at gunpoint and having his beloved watch collection stolen from him to mirror his own Holocaust experience. Stealing Chamberlain's scalpel, he runs away in terror, planning suicide, but luckily he is stopped. As Chamberlain sedates him, he pleads not to be sent back to the Nazis. Unable to watch his suffering any longer, Jennifer bolts, running from the car in tears. As morning approaches, back at the lab, Stradner is surprised to discover that Iago has awoken from the coma. Meanwhile, MacKenzie wants to discuss the stress tolerance of Cassandra Crossing, suspecting already that the train isn't going to make it. Max suggests as much to Jennifer over morning coffee as the train nears Poland; he notes that the line hasn't been used by trains since 1948, and that the locals all moved out ages ago, fearing that the shoddy construction would collapse. As it's the 1970's, this indicates that the bridge has not been used or tested in over twenty years. Exterior shots of the bridge in cutaway scenes reveal a rickety, rusty structure with multiple loose pieces, missing bolts and random scrap metal all over the tracks, confirming Max's words.MacKenzie begins to feel guilty about sending the passengers to Cassandra Crossing when he analyzes the stress figures for the bridge, as well as his knowledge that the disease came about due to biological warfare research. He urges his superiors to listen to him, but they order him to keep things going as planned. Meanwhile, Navarro develops a severe fever as he's afflicted with the disease. A worried Dressler urges him to seek Chamberlain's help, but he stubbornly refuses. Finally he relents, rolling up his sleeve for an injection. Chamberlain sees the telltale marks of heroin injections on Navarro's arms, and concludes that Navarro is in withdraw, opting not to medicate him until it's over. Jennifer asks the now conscious Kaplan if Cassandra Crossing is really as dangerous to travel on as Max has told her. Kaplan agrees, telling her that no human being wants to be near the bridge anymore. He also suggests that being made to go back over the bridge is God's will, and that God wants him back at the concentration camp to die. He further reveals that it's fitting, because the camp is where his wife and two daughters were killed; he wishes to be with them.Chamberlain learns of the risk of Cassandra Crossing. He also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected, and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie, suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie, acting under orders, has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the U.S has been harboring germ warfare agents in a neutral country. Stradner elatedly reveals that Iago is fully recovering, which offers some hope of survival for the passengers of the train. MacKenzie insists the train continue on its intended journey anyway, as it's beyond his control now.Navarro snaps after being caught by Haley. He takes Dressler hostage, and threatens to shoot every guard aboard the train unless the train is stopped and he gets a helicopter on the roof. Chamberlain suspects Navarro just wants a fix, and shouts at him until he cries, calling him a coward, while Dressler scolds him for using a drug as ""common"" as heroin. Navarro breaks down sobbing, but since he hasn't hurt anybody, he's spared after surrendering his guns. Chamberlain notices that Navarro is recovering, and he's even more surprised to see that the hippie couple, who'd both been almost comatose with fever earlier on, are fully recovered and looking for something to eat. An unnamed infant baby that was sick, as well as Caterina, have both recovered completely, thus further revealing that the disease may not have been as serious as MacKenzie and Stradner thought. Stradner begs MacKenzie to stop the train, noting that if he simply stands by and allows innocent people to be killed, it's almost worse than murdering them. She believes that murder is not his intent, and that he's merely following orders, which still repulses her.Chamberlain rounds up Navarro and Haley to help him in trying to force the guards to stop the train. Navarro coldly snaps at Dressler that his gigolo routine with her was simply to get in and out of various parts of Europe to traffick drugs as her companion without suspicion, and he leaves her in stunned shock. The hippie couple create a diversion for the guards; the female hippie, Susan, undresses out in the open, attracting a leering guard to watch, while Susan's boyfriend, Tom, knocks out the guard and steals his machine gun. Meanwhile Chamberlain tries to convince Captain Scott, the guard leader, that even his own life will be cut short if they don't disobey orders and stop the train. Scott punches Chamberlain in the face. Haley tries to exercise his own authority as a police agent, but is held at gunpoint. Navarro admits to having feelings for Dressler despite his cold exterior, requesting that Jennifer take her to a place on the train where it's safer, while Max, Haley, and a number of other passengers gather together, armed and ready to stop the train on their own. While Navarro climbs to the roof of the train, a shootout ensues. Bobby, a friend of the hippie couple, is able to get one of the machine guns as the guards are subdued.Caterina's nanny is almost killed, but is pulled back by Navarro and rescued before she can be shot at. Navarro reveals that the roof of the train is just as inaccessible as the rest of it for getting to the engine. Chamberlain has another idea, unhooking one portion of the car from the rest of the train, but this horrifies Jennifer, who argues that the remaining military guards and the children, including Caterina, will all be killed if they're left behind. Navarro offers to help by attempting to climb the outside of the train from one shutter to the next so that he can unhook the cars, in the hopes that he can also redeem himself for his past actions by saving his new friends. Haley doubts the altruism of the man's intent, fearing he might just jump off the train and leave the passengers to die as he looks for his next drug fix, but Navarro is eager to help, acquiring Tom's tennis shoes so that he'll have better footwear for climbing across. He says farewell to Dressler, calling her ""baby"" (her usual preferred pet name for him), while Caterina's nanny fears that the little schoolgirl will be killed when the cars are separated. Back at the lab, Stradner reveals that Iago has completely recovered, hoping MacKenzie will finally understand her hope. Instead, the man rudely quips that she should take the dog out for a walk. On the train, Haley enters another shootout, and is stunned to find Mr. Kaplan sitting alone by himself in the abandoned car, having resigned himself to death. Navarro climbs out the window, and Chamberlain wishes him good luck.Navarro makes his way across the shutters nervously, nearly losing his footing, while Stradner and two military officials watch a real-time computer tracker showing the train rapidly approaching Cassandra Crossing. Meanwhile Jennifer finds some cheap booze and a ball of twine, hoping that if Navarro's plan fails, she can light the twine on fire and dislodge the cars with an explosion from a nearby propane tank in the kitchen. Caterina drops her musical chime ball toy in the hallway, and when picking it up, she sees Navarro out the window. She begs the military guard nearby not to hurt him, but the guard shoots Navarro, knocking him from the moving train where he falls to his death on a boulder nearby, much to the horror of Chamberlain, who watches out another window. Caterina cries for her nanny, horrified at Navarro's murder, which disturbs the military guard when he looks over his shoulder and sees how upset the children are. Chamberlain reveals to Jennifer that Navarro didn't make it, thus leaving her plan the only feasible option left. Chamberlain, out of ammunition in his machine gun, orders Jennifer to get all the passengers to second class where it's safe, while he stays behind to execute the plan.Tom and Caterina's nanny are both shot by a military guard, and dragged to safety in another car by Susan, Max and Jennifer while Bobby subdues the guard. A nervous Captain Scott, who doesn't want to kill, orders Chamberlain to come out and face him, but Chamberlain is busy trying to light the piece of twine soaking in booze that Jennifer left behind, as the flame keeps going out. Captain Scott rolls out a canister of tear gas. Chamberlain desperately calls out to Haley to give him a match so he can re-light the twine, while Kaplan sits there frozen in silent shock and gas fills the hallways. In a daze, he gets up and wanders out into the hallway, urged to go to second class where it's safe, while Haley is relieved to discover a frightened Caterina sobbing in the hallway, calling her by her nickname, ""sweets"". Caterina runs into his arms and he attempts to flee with her to safety, but she's shot in the back by Captain Scott, falling to his death, much to Caterina's terror. Luckily, Caterina was taken just far enough by Haley to a safe place that she's able to stay beside Chamberlain, while Kaplan stands near the twine and lights it, committing suicide but also courageously stopping the engine with an explosion at the same time. Jennifer finds Chamberlain and Caterina, but sadly, they are forced to leave Haley's body behind.Stradner and MacKenzie watch silently in surprise when they see that the train tracker has frozen on-screen, indicating that the train has stopped before reaching Cassandra Crossing, when in actuality, the cars are still attached and gliding by without the engine. Luckily, Kaplan has slowed it down enough that Chamberlain can get to the hinge that lodges both sides of the train together, which he struggles to do before it's too late. He's finally able to dislodge the second class car, jumping to his safety. He falls out of the back of the train and rolls down a hill, alive, while Max puts on the emergency brakes for the second class car. The first class car continues on its trajectory over Cassandra Crossing, and as predicted, numerous people are killed as the bridge collapses in a bloody scene, including two of the children whom Caterina had befriended, an elderly lady, some young teenagers, the military guard who murdered Navarro, many crew members for the train, and numerous other people. Stradner shuts her eyes as she and MacKenzie listen to the collapse over the radio, as she believes that nobody survived. When she sarcastically congratulates MacKenzie on ""quarantining"" the passengers for good, telling him that maybe there were survivors, he tells her that the oxygen pumped into the train would have generated an explosion that killed everybody, including the appointed military guards. Stradner, disgusted, is only able to say, ""I see"", finally aware that his goal all along was to have them killed to contain the disease. MacKenzie tries to push a collectivist ideal, arguing that he's a military man whose goal wasn't just to contain the disease itself, but also any knowledge of it. He then threatens Stradner into silence, urging her not to risk her career as a doctor over the lives of the passengers.An exterior shot shows the unfortunate train submerged in the water of the river below Cassandra Crossing, along with large concrete chunks of the ill-fated bridge, steel beams, human corpses, and sentimental objects belonging to the passengers, including Jennifer's advanced reader's copy of her biography. Meanwhile, a number of survivors pour from the train, including Jennifer herself, Caterina, a lesser military guard, Susan, Tom, Max, Bobby, Dressler, the unnamed mother and her baby, and Chamberlain assisting with getting everybody out alive. Sadly, Caterina's nanny does not emerge, implying that she died of her gunshot wounds. A tearful Caterina is hugged by Chamberlain and Jennifer as more unnamed survivors exit the train. Meanwhile, a guilt-ridden MacKenzie shuts off the tracking equipment and alerts his superiors - or rather, promises them - that there are no other survivors. He finds himself on the receiving end of his own disregard for individual human life though when another military official, Major Stack, informs MacKenzie's superiors that both MacKenzie and Stradner are under surveillance to make sure they don't freely speak out about the disaster."
Voyage of the Damned,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075406/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The tragic 1939 voyage of SS St. Louis carrying hundreds of German Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany that seemingly no nation is willing to save from certain doom. In 1939, Germany's Hamburg-America Line announced a voyage from Germany to Cuba. 937 people, the vast majority being Jews, signed up for the opportunity to escape Nazi Germany. Unbeknownst to the passengers, the visas they purchased were from a corrupt Cuban director of immigration, and they were invalid. Upon arrival in Havana, only 28 people were allowed to disembark, while the rest remained on board for weeks as they sailed to Florida, and eventually Canada, searching for safe haven. Sadly the ship returned to Antwerp after more than a month at sea. Forced back under Nazi rule as the low countries fell, it is estimated that approximately 250 of the refugees died in the extermination camps in occupied Poland.—JBentley Based on the true story of a ship carrying hundreds of German-Jewish refugees, which was sent to Havana in 1939 by the Nazis but was denied permission to land anywhere. The ship was eventually obliged to return to Germany, where certain death awaited many of its passengers. Organized by the Nazis in May 1939, nine hundred thirty-seven Jews set sail on the S.S. St. Louis, a luxury ocean liner, from Hamburg to Havana. The passengers are sailing to freedom in Cuba, where their friends and relatives are awaiting their arrival. The passengers have mixed emotions about their voyage: some are happy about freedom, some are sad to leave their German homeland, and some are angry about accepting anything from their Nazi persecutors. Some of the crew, those that sympathize with the Nazi Party, are also angry that the Nazis would allow Jews to sail to freedom and are angry about having to serve their inferior passengers. The ship's Captain, Schroeder, is a non-political man, and does whatever he can to ensure a safe and comfortable voyage for his passengers. Unbeknown to most of the crew, including the Captain, and the passengers all of whom were only issued tourist visas, a wave of antisemitism is sweeping across the western hemisphere, in part fueled by the Nazis. The passengers, as refugees, are obviously intending on staying once landed despite their visas. Thus, the fate of the ship and its passengers is uncertain when it lands in Havana Harbor. Perhaps this outcome was the Nazi plan all along so that the world could no longer object to how the Nazis deal with Jews at home.—Huggo"
Fellini's Casanova,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074291/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Giacomo Casanova uses his sexuality to find his place in life amid eccentric and strange characters. Based on the memoirs of Casanova, Fellini offers his version using rare visual daring and imagination. The film features a breathtaking performance from the sultry Sutherland as the original playboy in his latter days as he travels through Europe engaging in a variety of amorous adventures.—Mr Bongo An episode tale which mostly takes place in 18th century Italy. Giacomo Casanova is a modestly wealthy adventurer who leads a futile existence; his only strengths lie in seduction and sexual performance. His life becomes increasingly meaningless as lovers slip away. The film is loosely based off of the biography by Giacomo Casanova himself, although, like all of Fellini's literary adaptations (post 8 1/2), the film is decorated with a wreathe of absurdity.—Ed Weary, down-and-outGiacomo Casanova, the legendary Venetian seducer, recalls his dense, turbulent life. Left to rot in the impenetrable Piombi prison, incarcerated Giacomo escapes death by the skin of his teeth and abandons his beloved city forever. With his illustrious reputation preceding him, the proud, sophisticated intellectual meanders through the bustling cities of 18th-century Europe searching for inspiration and excitement, only to find himself up against a formidable adversary: the irresistible, almost uncanny attraction between him and all women.—Nick Riganas The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th-century Europe. The organizers of the festival attempt to raise a gigantic bust from the water; this fails, which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced, as he visits one of Venice's islands to copulate with a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him, but is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into alchemy and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees, Anna Maria, who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire for Anna Maria. Back in prison, Casanova escapes through the roof and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the Paris court of Madame d'Urfé. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him (an act that requires the presence of a younger woman in the room, so that Casanova can get aroused). Fortuitously, Casanova encounters his brother, whose girlfriend he entices away. Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl-""the love of his life""-Henriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual theatrical performance for his guests that unsettles some of them; Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette, and she's left a request that Casanova not attempt to follow her. While in London, Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarfs distracts him; he follows them to a frost fair, where he arm-wrestles the giantess-a princess-and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarfs. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in Rome, where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver, Righetto, over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Switzerland he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden, he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in Württemberg, where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Time goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he is made to eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant, Faulkircher, and his lover Vidarol, make him an object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on, during a fervent poetry recital, a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova, who, humiliated and disappointed, goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film, buried under thick layers of ice in the lagoon. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again. They quietly dance with each other."

In the tiny kingdom of Euphrania, the King (Sir Michael Hordern) and his court are most anxious to get Prince Edward (Richard Chamberlain) wed. But Edward wants to marry for love. Meanwhile, young Cinderella (Gemma Craven) finds life drastically altered with her father's death, as she's forced to be a servant in her own house. But a cheery Fairy Godmother (Annette Crosbie) helps her with her impossible tasks, and even gets her to take an evening out at the King's bride-finding ball. But when the magic wears off, and the prince with shoe-in-hand searches for Cinderella and finds her, what is going to happen to Euphrania without the needed marriage alliance to prevent war?—Kathy Li Beautiful version of the classic Cinderella story, as Prince Edward (Richard Chamberlain), heir to the throne of Euphrania, is expected by the King (Sir Michael Hordern) and Queen (Lally Bowers) to choose a wife and settle down. To this end, they plan a court ball to which all the Princesses they can locate will be invited. Meanwhile, young Cinderella (Gemma Craven) has just lost her beloved father. But things go from bad to worse for her, when her selfish Stepmother (Margaret Lockwood) and spoiled stepsisters reduce her to the status of a servant in her own home. Thankfully, however, her Fairy Godmother (Annette Crosbie) is waiting in the wings to see that she goes to the ball and meet the Prince. The rest is up to them.—phillindholm In the European kingdom of Euphrania, the life of a young lass named Cinderella (Gemma Craven) is radically changed upon the death of her loving well-off father, who deeded his entire estate to his second wife, Cinderella's Stepmother (Margaret Lockwood). He did learn that his second wife only married him for his money and her own self-interest, but not before he could change the will before his death. Cinderella's evil Stepmother banishes Cinderella to live and work on her and her spoiled daughters' behalves in the mansion's dungeon kitchen, to the point of Cinderella being enslaved to their duty and beck and call. Meanwhile, the King (Sir Michael Hordern) and Queen (Lally Bowers) of Euphrania want their only son, Prince Edward (Richard Chamberlain), to marry a Princess of their choosing, unlike Edward, who wants to marry for love. The King's want for Edward is even more important when Euphrania is placed in a tenuous geopolitical situation which requires an alliance between Euphrania and its European neighbors, meaning Edward should marry a Princess of one of those countries. The King's advisers recommend holding a ""bride finding ball"" for Edward, who abhors the idea, but goes along with it. In addition to eligible Princesses, Euphranian nobility is also invited. As such, one of Cinderella's new tasks is to help her Stepmother and stepsisters prepare for the ball. In the process, Cinderella learns that the mysterious travelling woman who one day appeared at the kitchen doorstep is really a Fairy Godmother (Annette Crosbie), albeit sometimes a not very adept one with limited powers, who not only has come to help Cinderella with her household chores, but help her attend the ball as well in the guise of a Princess named ""Incognita"". With her limited powers, the Fairy Godmother is only able to keep Cinderella in her Princessly ways until midnight. At the ball, Edward does fall in love at first sight with ""Incognita"", but is unable to learn all he needs about her before she has to run off at midnight, leaving behind only Edward's longing for her and her delicate slipper. In searching for the young woman who fits the slipper, Edward may not place his eyes on a servant girl like Cinderella. Even if he can find Cinderella, a happily ever after may not be that easy with the King and Cinderella's Stepmother in the picture.—Huggo Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl!"

Drive in Massacre,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074434/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two police detectives try to catch a serial killer who is stalking a rural California drive-in theater, randomly killing people with a sword. A opening title card reads that on August 10th, at a rural California drive-in, the horror began. A young couple arrives at a local drive-in to watch the movie playing that is currently playing. They park their car and talk about having a baby. The woman suggests procreating at the drive-in, but the man, Alan, wants to see the beginning of the movie. As Alan reaches out for the speaker to hang upon the car window, he is beheaded by a sword-like machete. The woman screams, but the unseen killer shoves the blade through her neck and she dies a slow death as she opens the car door and falls out onto the ground.The next day, two police detectives, John Kosh and Mike Leary, go to the drive-in to investigate the murders and talk to the grumpy manager, Austin Johnson. Austin tells them about a carnival what was once there before the ""trash heap"" of the drive-in was opened. He says that Germy, the simpleton drive-in cleaner and the man who discovered the bodies, was once a carnival geek. The cops talk with Germy where he tells them that he was once a sword swallower, and he says that the theater owner (who is away in Hawaii on vacation) lets him use his private sword collection. Germy talks about a trouble-maker who is at the drive-in every night looking for kissing couples to spy on. He describes the man and his car to John and Mike, and the officers ask Germy to get the license plate number if the man returns.That night, another young couple, named David and Lori, arrive at the drive-in, and Lori tells David that she is pregnant. David seems happy with the news and the two of them kiss, but Lori is uncomfortable due to the murders on the previous night. While David and Lori are making out, an unseen man is spying on them. Suddenly, another unseen man opens the passenger door and shoves a sword right through David and Lori.The next morning at the police station, John and Mike talk with their police captain who introduces them to a police psychologist who tells them that it may be difficult to find the killer since he does not seem to leave a pattern except for the using the same weapon and using the same location to kill. Afterwords, Germy is brought to the police station where he tells John and Mike that the sword discovered with the two recent murder victims is not from the owner's personal collection. He tells them that Austin also worked at the carnival, but was ""not very good with the blades"", and chased around girls for fun. But he tells them that the mysterious man was at the drive-in that night and gives them the license plate number.John and Mike go to see Orville at his house where the cops press the man about being at the drive-in for the last two nights. While Mike plays the bad cop, John is the sympathetic cop. While Orville admits to being at the drive-in to spy on couples having sex in their cars, he maintains that he did not kill anyone and promises that he will not return to the drive-in. He lets the officers look at his car. When a bloody cloth is found, Orville runs. John and Mike catch up to Orville and arrest him. Orville claims that the blood is from a dog that he ran over the previous night.A little later, the cops are told by a pathologist that the blood on the rag found in Orville's car is really from a canine. Orville is released with a warning not to return to the drive-in. But that evening, Orville returns to the drive-in anyway. Nearby, John and Mike are staking out the place as decoys (with Mike dressed in drag), waiting for Orville to show up and make his move. Nearby in another car, a man, named Jim, tries to kiss the woman that's with him, but she is too much into watching the movie. The man exits the car to go to the concession stand. Germy goes up to the police officers car to talk with them, when he gets pulled away by Austin who tells him to get back to work. Mike gets out of the car to ""answer the call of nature"" and John helps him get out of the car. Nearby, Jim returns to his car, when he sees his girlfriend's severed head fall off her body, and screams for help. Mike and John run back to the scene, but then discover Orville dead in his car too.The next day, Austin is brought into the station where Mike and John talk to him about once being a knife-thrower at the carnival. But Austin is furious at them when they tell him to close down the drive-in until the case is solved, and mocks them for being so close to the killer while he killed another person right under their noses. But after several minutes of interrogation, Austin is free to go since the police do not have anything to hold him on. At the drive-in, Austin tells Germy that he's fired and also tells him to get his things and leave. That evening, Germy goes to a nearby carnival and hears voices talking to or about him.Meanwhile, John and Mike get a phone call that a man is cornered in a small warehouse after killing two people with a machete. In the warehouse, a man has a little girl hostage. She bites his hand and runs away. The man chases after her and talks about cutting the ""poison"" (he means meanness) out of her. John and Mike arrive at the warehouse, run inside, and following gunfire and a pursuit, Mike shoots and kills the man. The girl comes out of hiding and says that the man they killed was her sick father, who had killed her mother and aunt years ago with a machete, but that he broke out of a mental hospital that morning.John and Mike suddenly realize that Austin can leave the projection booth between the reel changes during the movie which could make him the killer since he told them previously that he was inside the booth all night. John and Mike race over the drive-in to pick him up.Meanwhile, Arlene, the drive-in cashier, tries to stop Germy from going to see Austin. Germy says that he owes him money and that he has a gift for the manager. Germy is shown to have the owner's sword collection with him. John and Mike arrive at the drive-in where they see on the big screen where a western movie is being shown, the shadow of Austin being stabbed by a sword. The detectives run inside the projection booth to find Austin dead... hacked to pieces. While Arlene turns on the PA speakers announcing that everyone leave, John and Mike hear a noise in the next room and run in with their guns drawn only to find Germy dead as well.A disclaimer in the final shot says:""The senseless bloodbath that gripped a California Drive-in has spread to other theaters throughout the country. Authorities say there are no clues to the killer's identity and no end to the horror in sight. The killer could strike again. Anywhere... Anytime... Who will be next?""There is a public-address voice-over from the drive in theater manager telling the drive-in theater audience viewing this movie that there is a killer lurking in the theater and not to panic for the police are on their way."

The watchmaker asks a hypothetical question that will change their lives. The Fifth Seal is a study in depersonalization.

He goes on living knowing he is a good person, as he never committed such appalling, sadistic acts on another like his master has done. The rich master has no moral qualms about it at all. He doesn't think what he did was wrong; the slave needed to be punished. You have the choice, whether to be a poor and righteous slave or be a rich and corrupt master.""This hypothetical question changes their lives"
Mikey and Nicky,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074901/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Nicky is on the run from the mob, and he turns to old pal Mikey for help. Nick is desperate, holed up in a cheap hotel, suffering from an ulcer and convinced that a local mobster wants him killed. He calls Mikey, his friend since childhood, but when Mikey arrives, Nick won't let him in: his moods swing. So begins a long night as Mike tries to take care of Nick, calm him down and get him out of town. Their sojourn - on foot and in a city bus - takes them to a bar, a club, toward a movie theater, to the cemetery where Nick's mom is buried, and to Nick's girlfriend's apartment. Tempers fray and the friendship is tested. Meanwhile, a hit man who's getting information from someone is indeed looking for Nick.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> Elaine May crafted a gangster film like no other in the nocturnal odyssey Mikey and Nicky, capitalizing on the chemistry between frequent collaborators John Cassavetes and Peter Falk by casting them together as small-time mobsters whose lifelong relationship has turned sour. Set over the course of one night, this restless drama finds Nicky (Cassavetes) holed up in a hotel after the boss he stole money from puts a hit out on him. Terrified, he calls on Mikey (Falk), the one person he thinks can save him. Scripted to match the live-wire energy of its stars-alongside supporting players Ned Beatty, Joyce Van Patten, and Carol Grace-and inspired by real-life characters from May's own childhood, this unbridled portrait of male friendship turned tragic is an unsung masterpiece of American cinema."

Ode to Billy Joe,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1950s Mississippi, teenager Bobbie Lee Hartley navigates her blossoming hormones as she is courted by Billy Joe McAllister, who is headed for tragedy. At last, we're given the answers to the questions raised by the haunting 1967 Bobbie Gentry song of the same title. Eighteen- year-old Billy Joe McAllister is in love with Bobbie Lee, but her father refuses to allow her to receive gentlemen callers before she's sixteen. In the Mississippi Delta, in a time before the boondocks had seen television and indoor plumbing, a young man's fancy turns constantly to thoughts of love. Billy Joe is no different in this regard and his persistence is making it difficult for Bobbie Lee to maintain her virtue (the dog-earred issues of ""Torrid Romance"" don't help either). Perhaps an indictment of the artificial conventions of society, the film demonstrates the tragic consequences of a young couple's first awkward grapplings with love and sex. As Bobbie Lee says shortly after Billy Joe's lifeless body is dragged from the Tallahatchie River, ""What do I know of love... I'm only a child."" Yet, there seems little doubt that what she feels for the dead boy is love. Could he have loved her so well?—Anonymous Set during the spring and summer of 1953 in rural Mississippi, Billy Joe McAllister (Robby Benson) flirts with Bobbie Lee Hartley (Glynnis O'Connor) as she crosses the Tallahatchie Bridge after the school bus lets her off as she walks on her way to her family's farm along a dirt road. Bobbie Lee reminds him that her father, Glenn (Sandy McPeak), still thinks of her as a child, even though she is 15-years-old and has been wearing a brassiere for two years. A friend since childhood, Billy Joe teases her about ""Benjamin,"" the imaginary friend in whom Bobbie Lee has always confided, and offers himself as a replacement. Bobbie Lee says nothing but is delighted by Billy Joe's attention.That evening, Brother Taylor (Simpson Hemphill), the local Baptist preacher, has dinner with the Hartleys, and Bobbie Lee is asked by her parents to play a hymn on the piano. Later, Billy Joe is at a saloon with some co-workers from the local sawmill where exotic dancer Belinda Wiggs (Frannye Capelle) is giving a performance, but he becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Meanwhile, Bobbie Lee is in her bedroom reading aloud from 'Torrid Romance'.The next morning, Bobbie Lee and her mother, Anna (Joan Hotchkis), pack eggs for market while Glenn loads cans of milk onto his pickup truck. Anna empathizes with her daughter's sexual curiosity and, although she knows her advice is inadequate, reminds Bobbie Lee that ""when the sap rises, a girl has to count to ten."" While driving their wares to market, Glenn and Bobbie Lee are trapped on the bridge by a pickup truck containing three drunken hick boys from Alabama. Glenn's inability to pass or shift into reverse results in a shoving match between the two trucks, which leaves Glenn's vehicle balanced precariously on the edge of the bridge. Bobbie Lee runs to Dewey Barksdale's (James Best) sawmill to get help from James (Terence Goodman), her older brother, who works there. As she returns to the bridge with James and sawmill workers Tom Hargitay (Eddie Talr) and Billy Joe, they are hindered by the Alabama boys, who veer continuously across the narrow road. Glenn is rescued, but his truck is badly damaged, which infuriates James.On Sunday morning, outside the local church, congregants compliment Brother Taylor on his sermon denouncing premarital sex, while Billy Joe tells Bobbie Lee of his intention to call on her that evening. She warns him of her father's strictness, but Billy Joe is undaunted. Toward evening, Bobbie Lee complains to Glenn about the family's need for electricity and indoor plumbing, before introducing the subject of ""gentleman callers."" When he asks her age, she answers, ""32B,"" referring to her bra size. Glenn promises to allow callers in two years, when she is ""34"". Bobbie Lee is exasperated and goes outside for a walk. While complaining aloud about the backward ways of her community, Bobbie Lee encounters Billy Joe. They walk to the side of a pond where they share their first kiss, before falling in.At the sawmill the next day, the teasing that Billy Joe endures from James and Tom reinforces his desire to move to another town. Meanwhile, a mother-daughter discussion of womanhood is interrupted when Glenn surprises his family with a new toilet for the house. The following afternoon, Billy Joe forces his way onto the school bus and makes public his intentions toward Bobbie Lee. She pretends to be embarrassed, but after they get off the bus, Bobbie Lee hints that her father may become more open-minded once the toilet is installed.That Saturday night, Barksdale's sawmill hosts a musical event called the Okolona River Bottom Jamboree. While people dance inside, a group of prostitutes create a makeshift brothel in an adjacent structure. After getting Billy Joe intoxicated on beer, Tom brings him to the brothel. In the parking lot, James discovers the truck belonging to the Alabama boys, and a brawl ensues, resulting in a broken jaw for one of the boys.On Tuesday morning, Trooper Ned (John Roper) and Trooper Bosh (Will Long) appear at the sawmill, along with Billy Joe's father, Dan McAllister (William Hallberg), who is looking for his missing son. Later that afternoon, Bobbie Lee finds Billy Joe by the pond. He has been hiding in the woods for the last three days, ashamed of a sin he committed at the Jamboree. When they both admit to loving each other, he asks her to meet him on the bridge at dusk to consummate their relationship.After dinner, Bobbie Lee finds the rag doll she named ""Benjamin"" and brings it with her to the bridge. When she arrives, Brother Taylor is fishing nearby, and Billy Joe, who is extremely tense, accidentally drops Benjamin into the river; this is witnessed by Brother Taylor. Once the preacher has left, they head to a wooded area, but Billy Joe is unable to perform. He bursts into tears and admits to having intercourse with a man, and must therefore be a homosexual. Bobbie Lee refuses to believe it and wants to resume their lovemaking, but he declines and sends her home. She tries to encourage him with the news that her father will allow gentleman callers. Billy Joe promises that he will do better next time.The next morning, the sheriff and his troopers pull Billy Joe's body from the river. At the funeral service, Brother Taylor professes that at least one among the congregation knows the reason for Billy Joe's suicide. Sometime later, while Bobbie Lee collects eggs in the chicken coup, James informs her that the McAllisters sold their house and have moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi. James falsely believes that his sister is pregnant by Billy Joe, as does almost everyone else in town, and is concerned that her reputation is ruined while Billy Joe becomes a folk hero. The neighbors have stopped speaking to Bobbie Lee's mother, and Glenn's deacon-ship with the church has been terminated after 20 years. James recommends that his sister seek an abortion, but Bobbie Lee says nothing in her own defense.One morning at dawn, Bobbie Lee leaves the farm with her suitcase and encounters Dewey Barksdale on the bridge. When she explains that she is leaving on the next bus, he tells her to stay and defend herself, aware that she is not pregnant. Barksdale admits that he was the man who seduced Billy Joe, and was on his way to tell her family. Bobbie Lee asks Dewey to keep his secret, believing that the truth would ruin both his life and the late Billy Joe's reputation. She is less concerned about herself, admitting that the scandal makes her feel like the heroine in a story from Torrid Romance. Barksdale requests the honor of driving Bobbie Lee to the depot.In a montage set one year later, James is married to his girlfriend Becky Thompson, Glenn has died from influenza, Anna is in mourning, and Bobbie Lee throws flowers off the Tallahatchie Bridge as a tribute to Billy Joe."

Although Anne knows Jonathan sneaks out of the house early in the morning against her orders, she is unaware that he is attending meetings of a secret society of five boys, who refer to each other only by a cardinal number, their rank within the group as assigned by ""The Chief"", number one. The Chief is an arrogant, sadistic pseudo-intellectual who needs to show his power and dominance over the other four in whatever means possible. He largely considers them immature as he spouts off his Nietzschean philosophies, centering on that adults create rules that ultimately disrupt the natural order of life. When the US based merchant ship the Belle docks in port, Anne and Jonathan meet Second Officer Jim Cameron. Jonathan, who is fascinated by the sea, becomes enamored with what Jim represents to him, the natural order the Chief speaks of, specifically of the sea. Anne becomes romantically involved with Jim while he is in town. Their encounters lead to Jim critically evaluating his life and future. As Jonathan believes Jim may be attempting to disrupt that natural order he so admires, Jonathan believes it is his duty to change Jim back to restore that natural order, and if that is not possible, to correct the impending disorder by whatever means necessary.—Huggo"

The California Atoms are in last place with no hope of moving up. But by switching the mule from team mascot to team member, (He can kick 100 yard field goals!) they start winning, and move up in the rankings, Hurrah! The competition isn't so happy.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> Hank Cooper the owner of a football team that's not doing so well and stands to lose the team to Charles Gwynn who lent Cooper the money he needed to keep the team afloat. Cooper makes a bet with Gwynn if the team can win half the games he keeps the team. Which is 7 games which is more than the number of games they have won in the past few years. That's when Gynn makes a different bet. Saying if a team can go from 0 to 7 can probably win their division, and if a team can do that, they can probably win the super bowl. Eventually Cooper learns of a mule named Gus from Yugoslavia that can kick a ball 100 yards away. He brings the mule and Andy, the boy who takes care of him over to be a novelty act but it isn't long that he makes Gus a part of the team. And they start winning. Gynn worried that they just might win tells his guy Wilson to handle it so he hires two ex-cons Spinner and Crankcase to keep Gus from being at any future games or make sure he can't kick.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The California Atoms are a professional football team in Los Angeles, owned by Hank Cooper (Ed Asner) and coached by the inept Coach Venner (Don Knotts). They are by far the worst team in the league and have not won a single game in years. Their cheerleaders are fat and ugly, and even the marching band is awful. Desperate to draw fans in somehow, Cooper wants a great half time show. His secretary, Debbie (Louise 'Liberty' Williams), sees a story in her parents Yugoslavian newspaper about Gus, a mule that can kick a soccer ball through the goal from anywhere on the field.Debbie flies to Yugoslavia and meet with Andy Petrovic (Gary Grimes), the young man who owns the mule, Gus. Andy's older brother is a local soccer star, and their parents idolize the brother and are very critical of Andy since Andy is terrible at soccer. Gus and Andy are hired to come to L.A.Meanwhile, Cooper is a compulsive gambler who owes a lot of money to two mobster bookmakers Charles Gwynn (Harold Gould) and Cal Wilson (Dick Van Patten). When Cooper tells them that he cannot pay them for he is broke, they give him a last chance bet: if the Atoms win the Super Bowl, he owes them nothing, but if they do not win the Super Bowl, the gamblers get the team from him... and implies that they might do him physical harm or worse, kill him.The Atoms are losing their first game, but Gus is a hit at halftime when he shows off his skills by kicking a football the entire lenght of the field. In the 2nd half, Gus is put into the game to kick a field goal. Andy tells the other players to throw the ball to him and Gus will kick a touchdown. (An obvious reference to Garo Yepremian of the 1972 Super Bowl Dolphins who notoriously infuriated Larry Csonka by running off the field yelling ""I kick touchdown""). The other team protests, and the announcers Pepper (Bob Crane) and Johnny Unitas (playing himself) are aghast. However, nowhere in the rule book does it say that players must be human, and the refs allow Gus to kick. With Gus making a field goal on each possession from anywhere in the field, the Atoms win.The Atoms go on to win their next few games thanks to Gus getting field goals every time, and are in first place in their divison. However, one catch is that Gus will only kick when Andy holds the ball and shouts the command: ""oyage"". Debbie has been assigned by her boss to watch over Andy and Gus, since she can speak his Serbian language, and there is an obvious romance budding between them. Gus is an intelligent mule, and it is clear he is trying to push them together.Meanwhile, the gamblers Gwynn and Wilson are getting upset about the team's success. Not wanting the Atoms to win, they hire two incompetent criminals/con artists, Crankcase (Tim Conway) and Spinner (Tom Bosley), to stop Gus from playing in the games. For the next game, Crankcase shows up impersonating a replacement driver with a horse trailer. He gets Andy and Gus lost in the desert so they miss the game. The Atoms lose. Cooper knows the gamblers were behind this, so he hires security guards for Gus and Andy.After a few more victories, Spinner dresses up as a police official and goes to ""review the security"" around Gus. While no one is looking, he spikes Gus's water pail with alcohol. A drunken Gus stumbles around the field and misses his kicks, and even falls on and crushes the football.Still with only two loses, the Atoms make the playoffs. Andy is a celebrity and is on a TV show. His parents appear on the show from Yugoslavia. They are unimpressed since he just holds the ball for Gus to kick. The father keeps saying that his older brother, a pro soccer star in their home country, is the real star.Before the playoff game, Spinner and Crankcase call Andy and tell him that Debbie has been in a car accident and is seriously injured. Andy runs to the hospital where Spinner is impersonating a doctor and he locks Andy up in an empty room. In the meantime, the Atoms are losing, with Gus refusing to kick for anyone but Andy. Andy manages to escape from the hospital and, wearing nothing but his hospital gown, attempts to reach the stadium before the game is over. However, when Debbie dresses up in Andy's uniform and asks Gus to kick for Andy, Gus does kick. The Atoms win with Debbie as holder, although everyone in the stands thinks it's Andy. Andy arrives when the game is over and is very upset. Andy privately confides in Debbie that it is like his father said, that he is nothing... that anyone can hold the ball for Gus to kick.When the Atoms reach the Super Bowl, Spinner and Crankcase steal Gus which is Spinner, in disguise as a Boy Scout Taskmaster bus driver being stuck in the middle of a country road, distracts Andy and Cooper long enough to help him fix his school bus while Crankcase steals Gus from his trailer and replaces him with another mule. Spinner and Crankcase then check into a local motel and lock up Gus with them.On the day of the big final game, Crankcase and Spinner turn on the TV set in their motel room to gloat as they plan to watch the Atoms lose. When Gus sees the Super Bowl starting on TV, he goes wild and kicks the TV set to pieces. In a bizzerk rage, Gus then kicks down the door to escape from his captors. At the Super Bowl, when the mule refuses to kick the football, Andy knows that it is not Gus, so he and Cooper leave the game and take off in a helicopter to search for Gus.In a long and comic chase sequence, Crankcase and Spinner chase Gus into a local supermarket where they attempt to recapure the intelligent mule, only he gives both bumbling thugs the slip. When Spinner tries to lasso Gus, the mule drags Spinner along a shelf and into a lobster tank. Crankcase is disposed of when he jumps on Gus' back, and the mule then runs down a supermarket row and throws Crackcase off his back and into a wedding cake display. Running from the supermarket, Gus is spotted from the air by Andy and Cooper and they land in the supermarket parking lot to collect him. They airlift Gus to the Super Bowl by half-time.With Gus back in the game, the Atoms come back hard, as Gus makes several field goals kicks. With seconds left on the clock, the Atoms are down 12 to 14, with the ball on their own 5 yard line. It will come down to this last field goal attempt. But on this last kick, Gus slips in the mud and misses the football. There is a scramble for the ball, and Gus kicks it to Andy standing off on the side. Andy takes the football and runs 95 yards for the touchdown and wins the game for the Atoms.After the game, Andy is hailed as the hero... thus leaving Gus in the background for the first time. While Coach Venner congagulates Andy, Cooper tells Gus: ""it's okay, everyone misses once"". After Cooper walks off to celebrate with Andy and the rest of the team, Debbie winks at Gus and says: ""I know you did that on purpose"". Gus winks back at her."

The Front,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074554/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1953, a cashier poses as a writer for blacklisted talents to submit their work through, but the injustice around him pushes him to take a stand. In the early 1950s Howard Prince, who works in a restaurant, helps out a black-listed writer friend by selling a TV station a script under his own name. The money is useful in paying off gambling debts, so he takes on three more such clients. Howard is politically pretty innocent, but involvement with Florence - who quits TV in disgust over things - and friendship with the show's ex-star - now himself blacklisted - make him start to think about what is really going on.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In the 50's, in New York City, the screenplay writer Alfred Miller meets his apolitical friend, the cashier of restaurant and smalltime bookmaker Howard Prince and tells him that he can not work anymore since he is blacklisted. Prince offers to sell his scripts to the producer of a TV station using his own name and Alfred offers a 10% commission to Prince. Prince uses the money to pay his debts and improve his life and soon he offers his name to two other blacklisted writers. Meanwhile he dates the TV screenplay editor Florence Barrett. When the veteran actor Hecky Brown is blacklisted and fired by the producer Phil Sussman, the idealistic Florence quits her job. But when Hecky Brown commits suicide, Prince takes a stand against the unjust system.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil It's the 1950s New York. The livelihood of successful television writer Alfred Miller is threatened when he is blacklisted, there no official recourse as the blacklist does not officially exist despite the very real consequences of those in power not hiring those on the blacklist. Such is the case with the producer of Alfred's show, Phil Sussman, who is unwilling to make waves against the network or the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) by retaining Communists or suspected Communists like Alfred. To get around the problem, Alfred, knowing that he cannot just write under a pseudonym, asks his childhood friend, Howard Prince, to be his front in submitting Alfred's scripts for the show under Howard's name. Howard, who works a low paying job as a tavern night cashier, accepts Alfred's offer for a small but still lucrative percentage as he is deep in debt in his side job as a bookie, and figures it's easy money. Initially, it being easy money does seem to be the case as Sussman and the show's script editor, Florence Barrett, love the scripts and don't seem to suspect anything. In fact, Howard wants Alfred to find more blacklisted writers for who to front, and Florence, despite already being in a relationship, seems to be falling for Howard largely due to the quality of his writing. All these items lead to Howard ending up rich and famous. Things begin to get complicated for Howard when the network, without telling him, wants to find out more about him, he a writer they had never heard of before mysteriously landing on their doorstep with these great scripts. An added complication is when Sussman is forced to fire larger than life lead actor Hecky Brown from the show for suspicions of he being a Communist, Hecky whose sole crime in this matter being in the wrong places at the wrong times in chasing after a girl. When Howard is eventually subpoenaed to testify in front of HUAC, he has to decide how best to handle the situation to protect himself, and to protect people like Alfred who he begins to feel are being persecuted for no good reason.—Huggo It's the early 1950s New York City. Unmotivated in life, Howard Prince works as the night cashier in a diner, he squandering whatever little money he earns and more on bad investments, mostly of the gambling kind, he thus in debt to a number of people. He is approached by his childhood friend Alfred Miller, a successful television script writer, who has just been blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), Alfred who had never hid his Communist sympathies since well before the government witch-hunt through HUAC. Knowing that writing under a pseudonym would not work to get writing jobs, Alfred asks Howard to be his writing front i.e. Alfred would write the scripts for the network show for which he was working for producer Phil Sussman, and Howard would submit them under his name for a ten percent cut, Phil none the wiser. Beyond Howard needing to learn how to seem credible as a writer to Phil and others, Alfred sees Howard as the perfect person for this job in this era as someone who HUAC would never investigate in he being overtly non-political. Beyond the money, Howard agrees purely in an act of friendship. But as Howard as Alfred's front becomes entrenched in the world of network television as a success, and now swayed by the money, Howard gets Alfred to convince two of his other blacklisted writing friends to let him act as their fronts for the same percentage cut. In the process, Howard meets two people who would influence him in this work. One is Florence Barrett, the show's story editor, who doesn't much like what the blacklist is doing to the business especially in being ""left"" leaning herself. She and Howard fall for each other, Florence's attraction to him in large part because of his insightful scripts. And two is comedian Hecky Brown, who doesn't know what to do about HUAC as he previously had some connection to left wing activities solely to impress a girl, HUAC who wants him to name names or find out others who HUAC may suspect as Communists, with he blacklisted if he doesn't cooperate. The blacklist is more devastating to actors than writers if only because actors cannot get a front to be them. Howard's relationship with the two will influence what he decides to do when, due solely to his increasing success leading to a covert investigation, he is asked to testify to HUAC.—Huggo Does Hecky himself turn anybody in? I remember he is an alcoholic with a ridiculous excuse for being one, namely that he saw his father drink one shot glass of whiskey every night by gulping it and so grew up thinking there is no way to drink except by gulping, though he consumes more than one glass. (What's your excuse?) And that he is blacklisted---did somebody rat him out in retaliation?"

She and the rest of Hoover's friends get in and roar away, with a deputy already in pursuit, but winds up crashing past the front paneling of a nearby restaurant, disabling his car. At the sheriff's office, an exasperated Harry is overwhelmed with the outrage from concerned parents, as well as Jones. Overwhelmed by the chaos, Harry sends them to wait inside the drunk tank.Soon after, the gang pulls onto a farm to pick up another one of Hoover's pals, Junior Hale, laid up with a broken leg. Soon, another deputy pulls in to block Hoover's path, causing both cars to obliterate the property and the deputy crashes into a mud bath, sinking his car. They later offer to give elderly Mr. Lewis a ride, only to get chased by another deputy onto a field and having Lewis' alarmed wife notify Harry accusing the kids of kidnapping her husband. Hoover continues his antics with the remaining deputies, as the sheriff's office becomes more crowded with other concerned citizens. Later, he and Darlene leave the gang behind, as they think they should temporarily leave the area and lay low in an unoccupied farmhouse, belonging to one of Darlene's friends, outside of town. Harry, now at his wit's end, is forced to enlist the help of Jones and his fellow racing buddies to go after Hoover.The drivers track Hoover and Darlene down at the house and a wild chase ensues through fields, mountain roads, and eventually down a ravine. Harry, who is riding shotgun in one of the cars, suggests he and Hoover talk, but refusing to accept the repercussions, Hoover drives off. Some of the deputies now announce their resignations and Jones becomes clearly impressed with Hoover's driving. As night falls, Hoover and Darlene arrive back in town, where they are greeted by all the citizens and label Hoover a local hero. As they pull into the race track's parking lot, Darlene makes a confession to Hoover saying she only liked him because of the car and disappears into the night. Hoover, feeling used, kicks the passenger door in frustration, with Jones showing up and scolding Hoover for mistreating a lady (meaning Mabel). He tells Hoover to get into the driver's side of the car and they do a series of laps around the track."

The womb instigates a rapid growth rate which causes the child to grow into adulthood within a matter of weeks. All is not well though as the child begins to exhibit some horrific tendencies...—<mr_ons@hotmail.com> Dr. Paul Holliston (Rock Hudson) accidentally strikes a Doberman pinscher with his car, and treats the injured dog in his home laboratory, assisted by Martha Douglas (Diane Ladd), his sister-in-law. Paul discovers that the dog is pregnant, and hopes to save the puppies, if not the mother. He calls his son, Gordon (John Elerick), asking him to bring supplies from the research hospital.Gordon is about to make love to his wife, Helen (Anne Schedeen) , who is pregnant with their first child. This is the first they have heard from Paul since his wife died in an automobile accident.Gordon and Helen deliver the supplies, and are happy to see Paul back at work. Paul is equally happy to see them, and is looking forward to having a grandson. He goes upstairs to change his clothes, and talks wistfully to a photograph of his deceased wife, Nicole. Martha, standing in the doorway, says that Nicole is still with them. Paul reminds her that the accident was his fault, and returns to the lab to find that one of the pups has already died.After Gordon and Helen leave, he considers a new strategy. Within a few hours, the mother is dying and only one fetus remains, but he is able to accelerate its development with a growth hormone called placental lactogen, a finding he records on tape. Soon the puppy, which Paul names Number One, is able to live outside the womb. He keeps her tranquilized in an isolette while he continues to experiment with the growth hormone. In less than three days, Number One is a fully-developed puppy; she is soon full grown and the tranquilizers are discontinued.Paul records the dog's remarkable ability to learn, and determines that she is experiencing no negative side effects. Believing he can rescue miscarried babies, Paul wants to experiment on a human fetus and arranges a meeting with Dr. Jim Wiston (Jack Colvin). When Paul leaves Number One alone in the car, she lets herself out against his orders. She is accosted by a small terrier, which she kills and hides before returning to the car.After Paul convinces Jim to supply him with a twelve-to-fourteen-week-old human fetus, Jim procures a female fetus from a suicide victim, which Paul hopes to grow to five weeks of age. Soon the fetus is aging one month per day; Paul discontinues the hormones, tranquilizes the baby and places her in an isolette. However, she continues to grow and is aging at the rate of two years per day, with old cells dying rapidly as new cells develop. Paul tries several methods to halt the process, and finally succeeds with the addictive drug, methotrexate. As he weans the girl from tranquilizers, Paul educates her subconsciously by playing recorded arithmetic lessons. When she awakens, Paul names the girl Victoria (Barbara Carrera) and tries to communicate with her by reciting equations. Paul is overjoyed when she is able to recite the equations on her own.The next day, Paul convinces Martha to stay with Gordon and Helen, using the excuse that he will be in Denver, Colorado. As Victoria explores the house, she removes a fish from Paul's aquarium and watches it die. Number One, having formed an instant bond with Victoria, hides the fish.Paul records Victoria's progress, noting that she utilizes virtually all of her brain's intellectual capacity, unencumbered by the experiences of childhood. He is also satisfied that she has not become addicted to methotrexate. Paul's only remaining concern is Victoria's slow emotional development, so he has her read the Bible to give her a moral foundation, but she finds the book illogical.Paul tells Victoria how she came to be, and that she was given her name because her survival was a victory. He also tells her that, had he not been able to control her cell growth, she may have lived and died without any awareness, or could have been nothing more than a medical curiosity.One day, Martha, believing that Paul is still in Denver, returns to the house on an errand. With Number One following her menacingly, Martha searches for Paul in the lab, while Victoria hides behind the door with a knife until Martha leaves. Victoria feels isolated and asks Paul to show her ""the outside world,"" so he takes her on a two-week vacation up the California coast.Upon their return, Paul and Victoria visit Gordon and Helen, who are having a party. Paul introduces Victoria as his new assistant, a University of Colorado graduate. Some guests are charmed by Victoria, including a flirtatious computer programmer named Collier (Vincent Baggetta); some aren't, particularly chess champion Frank Riley (Roddy McDowell), whom she humiliates in her first chess game. Helen adores Victoria, but Martha takes an immediate disliking to her.Later that night, after Paul and Victoria consummate their relationship and have sex for the first time, she is at first joyful, then suddenly racked with pain. Upon realizing that her cells are again aging and dying rapidly, Victoria injects herself with methotrexate. The next day, she consults Collier's medical computer for a permanent cure, and learns that she needs the pituitary gland extract from a five to six-month-old fetus.Victoria sits on the beach and ponders her dilemma, but is soon playing with a group of children, until the pain returns and she needs another dose of methotrexate.Later, at a dinner party, Victoria learns that Helen is more than five months pregnant. Martha tells Paul that Victoria is a fraud and one of them has to leave. Victoria overhears and, while Martha is asleep, gives her an injection. Martha leaves for Minneapolis, Minnesota, the next morning, and dies of a heart attack within hours.While Paul travels to Minneapolis, Victoria learns how to perform a cesarean section, destroys Paul's tape-recorded notes, and breaks into the office of Helen's obstetrician, where she selects a victim from his patient files: a prostitute who is six months pregnant. Victoria performs the procedure of removing the prostitute's fetus in Paul's laboratory, but despairs when she discovers that the fetus is dead, until Helen pays a surprise visit.In Minneapolis, Paul learns that Martha's death was caused by a toxic chemical, and, deducing that Victoria is the culprit, contacts Gordon, who is in Seattle, Washington, on business. When they arrive at Paul's home, they call an ambulance upon finding the prostitute, then run to the laboratory, where Victoria has already removed the fetus from Helen's body. Victoria begs for Paul's understanding, but he now sees her as a monster and injects her with a large dose of placental lactogen. She in turn stabs Gordon, who dies trying to save his wife and child.As the ambulance arrives, Victoria drives away, with Paul in pursuit. After a car chase, he runs her off the road, causing her car to crash and burn on the beach. Victoria, who has aged dramatically, escapes the wreck. When Paul tries to drown her, police and paramedics come to her rescue and arrest Paul. The medics discover that she is about to give birth. The baby is delivered and taken away as Victoria dies. Paul, now in custody and taken away in handcuffs to a nearby police car, screams in horror... unable to stop yet another evil monster he has created."

But then robbers steal the magic Borgia ring that made things a bit difficult for Wilby as a lad. Once again he keeps turning into a large woolly dog at awkward moments. Unless he can get the ring back his chances of winning the election don't look good, as mean old Slade soon realises too.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} In this sequel to the 1959 film 'The Shaggy Dog' now set 17 years later, the adult Wilby Daniels (Dean Jones) is now a successful attorney who is married to Betty (Suzanne Pleshette), and they have a 10-year-old son named Brian (Shane Sinutko). Returning to the town of Medfield from a vacation, the family discovers that they have been robbed of almost all their possessions, and Wilby blames the corrupt local district attorney John Slade (Keenan Wynn), who is reputed to have connections with organized crime, particularly with warehouse owner Edward ""Fast Eddie"" Roshak (Vic Tayback). After being robbed a second time later that night (along with their Navy admiral neighbor, Gordon C. Brenner), Wilby vows to run for district attorney to make his town safe again.Meanwhile, the two thugs who had robbed the Daniels', Freddie (Richard Bakalyan) and Dip (Warren Berlinger) (at the behest of John Slade), observe the cursed Borgia ring at the local museum and assume it might fetch a large sum, so they steal it. The ugly ring with a scarab on it can only be pawned off to local bumbling ice cream salesman, Tim (Tim Conway), who is the owner of a large Old English Sheepdog named Elwood. Tim figures he will give the ring to his girlfriend Katrinka (Jo Anne Worley), a local roller derby star and pastry assistant.While dressing himself in preparation for a live television broadcast to announce his candidacy, Wilby hears a report of the Borgia ring being stolen. He freezes in terror, then reveals his former shape-shifting secret to his wife, who is certain his story cannot be true; he warns her that if the Latin inscription on the ring (""In canis corpore transmuto"") [I transmute into the body of a dog] is spoken by anyone aloud he will turn into a shaggy dog. Soon afterward, Wilby is moments before his live television debut as Tim discovers the inscription on the ring and reads it aloud, causing his dog Elwood to disappear - only to reappear moments later as he takes over Wilbys body. Moments before the cameras roll, Brian notices that shaggy hair is growing all over his father, who reacts in horror as he realizes he is turning into a dog. He rushes from the house and cameras in his dog form and briefly confounds Tim, who cant understand why his dog Elwood suddenly can speak. After a few minutes spell wears off, and Wilby is now in his human form again and determined to find the ring as he faces the prospect of being a candidate in the public eye who never knows when he might turn into a dog.Soon, Wilbys fears come true as Katrinka receives the ring and once again the inscription is read, just as Wilby is giving a public address at a ladies garden club (the Daisies). Betty warns him of his shaggy condition a split-second before his canine form would become apparent to all gathered and creates a near riot while trying to escape. Once again, Tim finds Wilby in Elwoods form and is convinced that his talking dog could make millions; when Tim wanders off momentarily, Wilby returns to his human form, leaving a silent Elwood to confound Tim further. Meanwhile, Raymond, an agent (Dick Van Patten) of Wilbys rival, John Slade, gets suspicious and wonders why Wilby keeps disappearing.Desperate to find the ring, the hunt leads to Katrinka, who seems to have lost it in a vat of cherry pie filling intended for a John Slade fundraiser. Offering a reward to whoever finds the ring, Katrinka and her colleagues go into a mad dash to find it, eventually escalating into a large-scale pie fight. In the pandemonium, the ring once again finds itself in the hands of the local thugs who this time attempt to pass it off to an undercover police detective. Once again in the hands of the museum, the inscription is read aloud as a point of reference; in the middle of the police station, Wilby (who had arrived to confirm the ring had been recovered) finds himself turning into Elwood once again. This time, Slades agent puts two and two together when he overhears the museums curator explaining the rings reputed power and how his predecessor (from the first film) told him a story of a young man that turned into a sheepdog years ago. Slade is informed of this weakness in his rival, is dubious at first, and then invites Wilby to his office to test out the theory.Slade invites Wilby to his office and advises him to withdraw his campaign. Wilby refuses and tells Slade that when he is elected, he will have him investigated regarding his criminal connections. Slade then reveals he has his ring. With a reading of the inscription, Slade is thrilled to see Wilby Daniels turn into the shaggy dog right before his eyes and makes a call to the local pound. Wilby escapes hearing Slade repeat the inscription several times, which guarantees that the spell will not wear off, and he will be trapped in a dogs form for some time to come. Slade ignores warnings from Wilby that reciting the incantation too often could cause the spell to transfer to him and keeps reciting the incantation over and over.Wilby eventually disguises himself as a female roller-derby competitor to elude Slade, who as district attorney has the entire police force and animal control at his disposal. Eventually, Wilby is caught and taken to the local dog pound where he is able to understand the other dogs, who band together to help him escape by stealing the dog pound truck.With the help of Brian and Tim (who still thinks his dog Elwood can speak until Wilby tells him the truth about what really happened), Wilby gets evidence that John Slade is connected to organized crime as well as responsible for the break-in at his house to drive Wilby and his family out of town. Wilby and Tim trick Slade into showing up at Roshak's warehouse, and Wilby uses a tape recorder to collect information that confirms Slade's wrongdoings. With the help of his dog friends from the pound, he also manages to retrieve the ring from John Slade, who unfortunately has read the inscription aloud so many times that the curse has now passed onto him, causing him to transform into a bulldog.At the end, Wilby gets elected district attorney, Slade is supposedly jailed (although it is never actually revealed), and Tim gets engaged to Katrinka. Together, they adopt Wilbys dog friends from the pound."

Aces High,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075627/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In World War I, the high casualty rate amongst the rookie pilots of the Royal Flying Corps puts an enormous strain on the survivors. A naive young officer straight from school arrives on the Western front to fight the air war against the Germans. However, the life expectancy of green pilots is not very good.—Orde Saunders <ODS101@York.ac.uk> October 1917. A few years behind him at Eton, Stephen Croft has always idolized John Gresham, who was once his house captain and who is dating his sister. When eligible, Croft enlisted with the Royal Flying Corps after Gresham did an enlistment drive at Eton a year earlier, and now a Second Lieutenant with only four hours of flying experience, pulled some strings for the open position with the 76 Squadron at a temporary field base in France under Gresham, a Major, as commanding officer and squadron leader. When he hears, ""two weeks, that's how long you're lasting now,"" upon his arrival, Croft may not fully comprehend that that is the life expectancy of rookie pilots within the squadron. What Croft lacks in experience and skill, he makes up for in enthusiasm. During his time with the squadron, he will get a different perspective of both the war and Gresham, who not only did not want Croft there, but understands his own failings, he having turned to drink to cope with the horrors of war. While Captain Sinclair, fondly referred to as Uncle as the senior officer, tries to place a certain calm into the group, Gresham is tasked not only with leading the military battles, but holding the squadron together as a cohesive unit, when he too fully understands the feelings of someone like Lieutenant Crawford, who has a debilitating case of fear which he often hides behind mock ailments and a mock sense of arrogance.—Huggo"
The Twelve Tasks of Asterix,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072901/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Asterix and Obelix are tasked by Julius Caesar with accomplishing twelve impossible labors to determine the fate of their indomitable Gaulish village. When Julius Cesar fears, that he will probably never be able to defeat the gaulic village of Asterix and his friends, he has the idea of offering the Gauls a deal: if they are able to solve twelve tasks that he selected, he will hand over the Roman empire to them. If not, they have to submit.—Michael Zink After a group of legionaries is once again beaten up by the gauls, they imagine: ""With such huge strength, they can't be human... they must be gods"". Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a ""fighting technique he learnt in a distant land"". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4. Cross a lake. The problem being that in the middle of the lake is the ""Isle of Pleasure"", a paradise inhabited by beautiful Sirens. Both Asterix and Obelix are enchanted and drawn to the island, but Obelix comes to his senses quickly after discovering that there are no wild boars on the island, has an incandescent argument with the Sirens, and storms off declaring that they can't call it the Isle of Pleasure if they don't serve wild boars, calling Asterix to follow him.5. Survive the hypnotic gaze of Iris, the Egyptian. Iris uses hypnosis to make his clients believe they are animals. He tries to make Asterix act to the phrase, ""I am a wild boar"", but when Asterix constantly breaks his concentration by not paying attention and saying ""You are a wild boar"" instead, Iris gets horribly confused and ends up hypnotising himself and bolting out of the building on all fours.6. Finish a meal by Mannekenpix, the Belgian. The chef is famous for cooking gigantic meals for the Titans - the task was to eat one of his massive three-course meals ""down to the last crumb"". Obelix devours a boar with fries, a flock of geese, several mutton, an omelette made with eight dozen eggs, a whole school of fish, an ox, a cow, veal (""because to separate ze family...zat would not be right!""), a huge mound of caviar (with a single piece of toast), a camel, (and before we start on the main course"") an elephant stuffed with olives. Later on the chef leaves the kitchen crying as everything in his kitchen was eaten, but a slightly disappointed Obelix believes that the huge meals were only appetisers.7. Survive the Cave of the Beast. In a distinctly abstract sequence of the film, the pair must enter a cave that no-one has ever emerged from alive - even Tiddlus has no idea what lurks within it. They encounter, among other sights, tennis played with a skull, bats, and a subway (on parisier stop of Alésia), before meeting the Beast. The lights suddenly go dark and the Beast is not shown on-screen. After they leave the cave, Tiddlus asks out of curiosity what the Beast was actually like - Obelix happily replies that it was ""very tasty"".8. Find Permit A 38 in ""The Place That Sends You Mad"". A mind-numbing multi-storey building founded on bureaucracy and staffed by clinically unhelpful people who direct all their clients to other similarly unhelpful people elsewhere in the building, which is also full of confusing corridors and steep stairs. Obelix goes nearly insane after some time but Asterix eventually beats them at their own game by asking for an imaginary permit in a corridor that nobody knows about, making the staff victims of their own unhelpfulness and sending the place into disarray. Eventually Asterix is given Permit A 38 just to make him leave and stop causing trouble.9. Cross a ravine on an invisible tightrope, over a river full of crocodiles. Eventually the heroic duo decide to give up on the rope and go the easy way round, jumping off and fighting the crocodiles, leaving the bemused creatures dangling on the invisible wire.10. Climb a mountain and answer the Old Man's riddle. After a tough climb of the snowbound peak, the Old Man of the Mountain's challenge is to determine, with eyes blindfolded, which pile of laundry was washed with Olympus, ""the detergent of the gods"". Asterix performs this task easily in a parody of washing detergent advertisements.11. Spend a night on the haunted plains. The plain, haunted by the ghosts of fallen Roman soldiers, is not an easy place to sleep. Obelix tries to fight them, but cannot harm ghosts. Asterix, woken by the commotion, furiously confronts the ghosts and they flee when they realise that the Gauls are not afraid of them.12. Survive the Circus. When the pair wakes up after a night on the plains, they find themselves in Rome, (""either that or these Romans have learnt to build very fast"") with their fellow villagers, who have been brought to fight in the Colosseum. After the gladiators are beaten (with the help of Getafix's potion, of course) the animals are sent in, and the Gauls turn the Circus into a modern day circus.After the Gauls succeed in every task, Caesar agrees that they are gods, gives them control of the Roman Empire, and retires to live with Cleopatra in a little house in the country. Caius Tiddlus takes his reward by retiring to the Isle of Pleasure."
The Swiss Conspiracy,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073774/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A former U.S.Justice Department official is hired as a security consultant for a Zurich based Swiss bank when five of its clients are blackmailed. When a Swiss bank finds that the confidentiality of some of its more vulnerable customers has been compromised it calls in an American investigator, who soon uncovers a web of deceit and blackmail. With old debts being paid off his own health is soon in danger, but at least he starts to gets to know one of the bank's female customers pretty well.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} The banking industry in Switzerland is famous for maintaining secret numbered accounts, offering an ideal place to hide illicit funds of international criminals due to the privacy laws of the Swiss banks. Recently, however, Hurtil Bank, in Zurich, Switzerland, has received anonymous letters threatening to expose the names of depositors unless the bank pays ten million Swiss francs. Additionally, blackmail letters, asking for one million francs each, have been sent to five Hurtil account holders: Denise Abbott (Senta Burger), an attractive European socialite; Robert Hayes (John Saxon), a gangster from Chicago, Illinois; Dwight McGowan (John Ireland), a rich, corrupt businessman from Texas; Mr. Kosta (Curt Lowens) a businessman based in Amsterdam, Holland; and Mr. Rascha, an arms dealer, who was mysteriously murdered in a restaurant after receiving his letter.In an effort to avoid scandal and police involvement, bank president, Johann Hurtil (Ray Milland), hires American David Christopher (David Janssen) to investigate. Christopher, a former U.S. Justice Department official, runs an international consulting firm based in Geneva, Switzerland. During his initial meeting with Hurtil, Christopher is introduced to Denise, who mentions that the criminals must know she does not have a million francs, if they have access to her account.While at the bank, Christopher also encounters Hayes, who recently arrived in Zurich to confront Hurtil and vice-president Franz Benninger (Anton Diffring) about the blackmail. Upon learning Christopher has been entrusted with the case, Hayes is furious since Christopher was responsible for prosecuting him and his mafia associates in the U.S. Later, Christopher is en route to meet Denise at her hotel when Hayes tries to shoot him, but Christopher defends himself and exchanges blows with the gangster. Hayes flees, just before Captain Heinz Frey of the Swiss police arrives on the scene.As manager of Zurich's Federal Bank Detail, Frey is curious about Christopher's business with Hurtil, but the consultant remains guarded about the investigation. During his appointment with Denise that evening, Christopher learns that she had a love affair with Lord James Ashwood, a prominent British politician. If her Swiss account is compromised, Denise fears the romance will be exposed, causing a scandal for Ashwood and his family.Meanwhile, Robert Hayes is murdered by two assassins, and Frey and Christopher discover the body later that night. The following day Christopher's assistant, Connie, provides background profiles on the five account holders and reports that Hurtil and Benninger appear to be clear of any wrongdoing. Next, Christopher interviews McGowan, who states that he was careful not to share his Swiss account with anyone and cannot afford another setback since the U.S. Internal Revenue Service is investigating him for tax evasion.Back at the bank, Hurtil reads Christopher the final instructions from the blackmailers. Christopher and the three remaining blackmailed clients must deliver uncut diamonds worth 14 million francs to a location in Interlaken, Switzerland. Since the situation is more dangerous in the wake of two murders, Hurtil agrees to pay the entire ten million demanded from the bank, and the one million demanded from each of the five account holders.During the meeting, Kosta is present, and Christopher asks the Dutchman why a blackmailer would be interested in him, but Kosta does not have an answer. Later, Christopher succumbs to Denise's charm and spends the night with her. As the investigation continues, he suspects Franz Benninger and his girl friend, Rita Jensen, might be the blackmailers, after Christopher notices the vice-president furtively handing a portfolio to Jensen outside the bank. However, Christopher and Hurtil soon learn Benninger is innocent and can only be blamed for surreptitiously helping Rita access her deceased father's account for which she did not have documentation. With Benninger absolved, Christopher pursues another lead and informs Hurtil that he is flying out of town, but will return tomorrow, in time to comply with the blackmailer's instructions.At the airport, Christopher discloses details about the investigation to Frey, and the policeman grants him 24 hours to settle the case before he alerts Swiss authorities. Arriving back in Zurich the following day, Christopher is given a bag of uncut diamonds from Hurtil, then travels to Interlaken, accompanied by Kosta, Denise, and McGowan. There, the group receives further instructions from the blackmailer to board a steam train, but McGowan says he feels unwell and must return to his hotel. After the train ride up the mountain, Christopher, Kosta, and Denise are told by the conductor to proceed to the ski lift platform where an anonymous telephone caller orders Christopher to take the diamonds to the peak while Kosta and Denise remain below, in plain sight. However, Kosta offers to deliver the ransom instead, stating that he is more valuable to the blackmailers and, therefore, less likely to be killed. Christopher consents, and Kosta departs with the diamonds. Suddenly, Christopher changes his mind and follows Kosta, while pulling Denise onto the chair lift with him.Meanwhile, Frey and his men are en route to Interlaken to provide support for Christopher. During the ride on the ski lift, Christopher confronts Denise, revealing that he flew to London, England, yesterday to interview Lord Ashwood, who disclosed that she has been blackmailing him ever since the politician ended their affair. Christopher declares that Denise's talent as a mistress of wealthy men is the link between Kosta, McGowan, Rascha, and Hayes, and, together, the five of them organized the blackmail. He also blames her for the deaths of Hayes and Rascha.Elsewhere, McGowan does not return to Zurich and instead takes a helicopter to the top of the ski lift where he waits for the arrival of the diamonds. As soon as Kosta reaches the top, McGowan betrays his accomplice, shooting the Dutchman dead. McGowan tries to escape with the diamonds in the helicopter, but Christopher disables the tail rotor with a gunshot, then kills McGowan. After Christopher retrieves the diamonds from the snow, Denise attempts to charm him and acquire the precious stones, but he is no longer deceived by her cunning. When Denise aims a gun at him, Christopher outwits her, just as Frey arrives to apprehend the socialite."

On his deathbed, Carmine Vespucci's mobster father tells him to ""get Proclo"" - Carmine's brother-in-law Gaetano. With ""the hit"" on, Gaetano tells a cab driver to take him where Carmine can't find him. He arrives at The Ritz, a gay bathhouse where he is pursued amorously by ""chubby chaser"" Claude and by entertainer Googie Gomez, who believes him to be a Broadway producer. His guides and protectors through The Ritz are gatekeeper Abe, habitue Chris, and bellhop/go-go boys Tiger and Duff. Squeaky-voiced detective Michael Brick and his employer Carmine do locate Gaetano at the Ritz, as does his wife Vivian, but family secrets come out.—Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu> Slightly rotund Gaetano Proclo of Cleveland, Ohio long ago married Vivian Vespucci of the New York mob-tied Vespuccis - a marriage which has never sat well with Vivian's father, the controlling patriarch of the family. On his deathbed, old man Vespucci demands his son Carmine kill Gaetano, so that Gaetano will not inherit half the family garbage business. Knowing that his brother-in-law is going to have him killed, Gaetano goes on the run, hopping into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the last place the mob would look for him. Where the driver takes him is The Ritz, a male bathhouse. What straight Gaetano doesn't know when he checks into The Ritz is that it is a gay bathhouse, something he does not truly figure out until he is well ensconced within the goings-on at the facility that evening. Like many of the men who want anonymity while at The Ritz, Gaetano signs in under an assumed name, using Carmine's. While Chris, one of the regulars with a penchant for screaming, helps Gaetano navigate the bathhouse, Gaetano tries to steer clear of a few of the other regulars at the facility that evening: Claude Perkins, a chubby-chaser chasing chubby Gaetano, who Gaetano does not want to get too close to for a reason beyond the gay issue; Googie Gomez, the heavily accented Hispanic floor show performer who may or may not be a transvestite, who believes Gaetano is a Broadway producer and thus her ticket to stardom; and Michael Brick, a good-looking but slightly naive private detective hired by Carmine to locate Gaetano, having only a description to work from, and dim Michael cannot even see through Gaetano's obvious fake mustache and toupee. Further complications and misunderstandings ensue when Carmine arrives on the scene. As Carmine and Michael have never met, Michael believes that Gaetano, using Carmine's name, is his boss rather than the man he is supposed to find. The complications grow even further when Vivian arrives on the scene, knowing that her husband is somewhere in the gay facility, with her assuming he is there as a genuine customer.—Huggo Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston) is present with his wife's (Kay Ballard) family at her father's deathbed. Her father has never liked his son-in-law and before he dies, asks his son (Jerry Stiller), to kill him. Since theirs is a mob family, Gaetano takes the threat seriously and he runs, asking the cab driver to take him someplace where the Vespucci's will never find him. The cab driver's answer? The Ritz. The Ritz is a typical 70's gay bath house. Here you meet Chris ( F. Murray Abraham), a regular visitor who's on the prowl for the newest and/or hottest guy he can find. Also there's Claude Perkins (Paul B. Price), a chubby-chaser who takes a shine to Gaetano. Unfortunately for Gaetano, the cab driver was in the employ of his in-laws and so he tells them where he went. They send in Michael Brick (Treat Williams) who speaks with a very high voice. Also here is a really bad performer, Googie Gomez (played by the talented Rita Moreno) who is playing the bath houses for now and hoping to hit it big. She vascillates between looking for a producer that she was told would be in the audience (with whom she has a long and uncomfortable history) and decrying the belief of some that she is a drag queen. The result is a grand chase and a lot of laughs in very 70's style."

Mick's father resents any intrusion of their secluded life, be it a washed-up radio or a mob of idiot bird shooters who kill a number of birds before they are scared off by Fingerbone. Amongst the dead are some pelicans whose chicks are still in the nest. The boy brings them home to care for. His father isn't keen, but permits it. Three pelicans become a lot to feed when they reach maturity, so his father insists on releasing them. Two are never seen again, but one, Mr Percival, keeps coming back. Another intruder is the new primary school teacher, brought by the park ranger. She is concerned about the boy's education, and pushes hard for him to be sent to school, or at least to do schoolwork by correspondence. She means well, but she is resented by the father - he doesn't want anything to change in their reclusive life.—Paul Gerard Kennedy"

Plot: In the 1930's, a notorious secret society known as Spermula - centered around the ""rapture of being"" achieved through a total liberation of the senses - disappeared from ""civilized society."" They were rumored to have developed supernatural powers. Over time they have honed their powers, and put in motion a plan to return from the future and conquer the world that once exiled them. An elite force of commandos - in the guise of several beautiful females - are charged with the task of neutering the male population. This is to be achieved by extracting the male reproductive fluids (orally) - allowing the decadent human race to eventually die off from natural attrition. Ingrid (Dayle Haddon), leading the Spermulan assault, sets about neutralizing the leaders of the community in which they have established the invasion's beachhead ... and then plans to gobble up the rest of the male population in one lavish orgiastic party. Unfortunately, as Ingrid herself has foreseen, members of her cadre begin to succumb to the unfamiliar temptations of the flesh, and develop emotional attachments to their intended victims. Blighted by the curse of emotional love, the invaders are forced to withdraw ... for now. [Note: the English-dubbed ""Spermula"" was significantly re-written in the dubbing, invoking a hokey plot about the planet Spermula about to be destroyed in a giant collision, prompting the decision to invade Earth.]—ocoee96"

To instil a sense of order in the troops, who are more concerned with capturing the opposite sex than the enemy. Captain S. Melly takes over as the new Commanding Officer at an experimental mixed sex air defence base. It's 1940 and England is under heavy bombardment, but the crew seem more interested in each other than the enemy planes above. Captain Melly plans to put a stop to all this, and becomes the target of a campaign to abandon his separatist ideals...—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> Captain S Melly (Kenneth Connor) is put in charge of an experimental mixed-battery during the darkest days of the Second World War. It's a relief for Captain Bull (David Lodge) to greet his relief but Melly isn't prepared for the ball-squeezing Sergeant Major ""Tiger"" Bloomer (Windsor Davies) and the randy antics of Bombardier Ready (Jack Douglas), Sergeant Tilly Willing (Judy Geeson) and Sergeant Len Able (Patrick Mower). Sergeant Tilly Willing leads the women contingent of the battery. Willing and Able are a couple.Forever feigning illness or hiding in their underground ""Snoggery"" (which is what they call the air raid shelter), the troops are happily getting to grips with each other rather than the enemy. Most prominent of the females is Private Alice Easy (Diane Langton) who tries to charm her new commanding officer but only succeeds in propelling her top button into his system! Private Jennifer Ffoukes-Sharpe (Joan Sims) pines for ""Tiger"" while everybody - including little Gunner Shorthouse (Melvyn Hayes) - gets a piece of the action.
Melly orders a fake air raid to test the squad's readiness & they promptly run into air raid shelters. Its only when Sharpe takes pity on Tiger that she orders the troops to get out of the shelter & stand at parade rest.Melly orders Tiger to run the brigade into the ground, but the brigade demonstrates its supreme ineptness and demoralizes Tiger instead. The brigade makes Tiger demonstrate every obstacle on the obstacle course, and then sabotages it, so Tiger ends up falling in the mud pits, or on barbed wires and such.
Melly then decides to take things into his own hands by ordering a surprise inspection of the barracks. All the ladies are at the men's barracks, kissing and smooching. The men have installed a trip fire with an excreta pit to avoid this exact same thing. Melly goes into the excreta pit, twice & manages to injure his bum, without achieving anything concrete with the inspection.Then Melly orders a 12-mile hike but has to borrow battle fatigues from the troops as both his uniforms are covered in excreta. The troops apply some abrasive chemicals to the stitches, so that they come part during the hike, leaving Melly in only his undergarments. The entire battalion laughs its head off. Even Tiger cannot suppress his smile at Melly's condition. Melly was rubbing Tiger the wrong way by forcing him on the 12 mile hikes, even though his feet were not in the best condition for hiking.
Melly charges the entire Brigade and wants to see them in his office for sentencing. Tiger pushes the entire brigade into Melly's office, which ends up squishing him against the wall by a female soldier. Eventually, Melly has to let them off, as he cant even speak in that condition.Melly then orders segregation of the men and the women (by installing barbed wire between the men and women barracks), to stop all the Snoggery that the troops engage in. He orders morning Reveille to wake up the brigade at dawn, as the troops to waking up at their own leisure.
He then orders that all troops to always wear battle trousers (no skirts) ""and that is all"". The women are so angry that they troop out to parade in bare breasts and trousers. Melly orders total segregation of men and women. In desperation, they both start tunneling towards each other's barracks (in parallel tunnels). They still don't end up meeting each other.
Melly then orders a live anti-aircraft gun to be installed at the battalion as the one they had so far was wooden. The anti-aircraft gun gets stuck in the ground where the tunnel was built. Melly is livid & makes the battalion pull the gun out of the tunnel holes.Even after a tip-off to the medical officer, Major Butcher (Julian Holloway) segregation and rigorous training, the unit is still a laggard. An inspection by the cowardly Brigadier (Peter Jones) and Major Carstairs (Peter Butterworth) is the perfect opportunity for the troops to get their revenge on Melly & they do everything to that effect. They put a woman's bloomers up the flagpole. Melle is turned upside down during the gun drill. Then they jam the gun on purpose, and when Melle removes the jam, he is covered in soot. He goes to take a bath, but his soap is replaced with a chemical that turns blue when he comes in contact with air. Then his uniform is replaced with a woman's uniform and Melle has to strut around in a skirt.
But it is interrupted by an airborne attack and Melly's troop finally prove they are real British bulldogs as they shoot down several enemy airplanes."

Two men are riding a motorcycle through the streets of Rome, Italy. It is a week or two before Christmas. Fred (Marc Porel) is at the helm and Tony (Ray Lovelock) is riding pillion. At the same time, two other men on another motorcycle cruise through the streets. This pair of men attempt to rob a woman on the sidewalk by stealing her handbag, but she refuses to let go. They drag her along the street before she rams head first into a lamppost, killing her instantly. Still unable to work the handbag free, the second biker dismounts and viciously begins to beat the dead woman to force her to give up her handbag. Fred and Tony arrive to see the two assailants fleeing. Fred takes off after the two thugs while Tony stays behind to examine the woman. Finding her dead, Tony steals another motorcycle and ride off after the thugs.A long motorcycle chase ensues through the streets as many holiday shoppers jump out of the way. The only fatality is a seeing eye dog the thugs run over, leaving the blind owner hysterical. The chase leads through a café with Fred and his target wrecking the place. Going around the café, Tony, apparently stymied by an approaching traffic jam, rides OVER the cars, damaging several of them. After a game of chicken between the four men, Fred and Tony succeed in herding their quarry at speed into the back of a garbage truck. The first thug is gruesomely impaled in the crash, while the second is propelled through the cab and out into the street, injured but alive. Fred walks over to the second thug, and suddenly breaks his neck, killing him in cold blood.As the police arrive, Fred and Tony show their badges to them and reveal themselves to be officers of a ""special squad"" of police which carry out summary executions of criminals who would get way with crimes through legal technicalities. Fred and Tony report to their boss, known only as the Captain (Adolfo Celi), who knows full well of the excesses of his team. While the Captain plays lip-service to hauling them over the coals over their amoral and vicious tactics to capture or kill criminals, he couldn't care less since more and more thugs and common criminals continue to get away with murder, robbery, rape, and other violent crimes on legal technicalities.When Fred and Tony learn from an informant, named Morandi, about an illicit gambling joint located in the poor side of town, the two vicious officers travel over there one evening and proceed to torch all of the cars parked outside purely for revenge against the owners and the patrons who go there in the first place. Fred and Tony's exploits soon come under scrutiny by a high ranking inspector (Daniele Dublino) who is pressuring the Captain to have the elite, but troublesome team, disbanded. But the Captain soon learns about some things the inspector does in his off-time which leads Fred and Tony to take some action against the inspector.More exploits continue between the two amoral cops, whom are also roommates in a squalid apartment in a dangerous part of the city. When their once-a-week maid arrives one time to clean up the place, they proceed to taunt the poor woman by suggesting they have both had sex with her daughter. Norma (Silvia Dionisio), the attractive secretary to the Captain, is practically the den mother to them whom they like to chat up with during their breaks at the station. When Fred suggests to Norma he should have sex with her, she sarcastically replies that she would prefer a threesome (with Tony) for both of them would give her a few too many orgasms.Another day or two later, Tony and Fred are called to the scene of a hostage situation where the city police commissioner and several of his officials ask for their help to defuse a dangerous complication where three armed men have taken a middle-aged woman hostage in her house and threaten to kill her unless they receive a car outside the house. While Tony plays decoy by driving up to the house in a car, Fred sneaks out back on his motorcycle. When the thugs realize that they are being set up, they fall back into the house where Fred smashes through the back door on his motorcycle and shoots and kills two of the kidnappers. With the lead kidnapper holding the woman as a shield, Tony runs in through the front door and guns the last thug down.Another day later, Tony and Fred stake out the scene of a bank where a robbery of an armored truck will take place. The two cops don silenced pistols and kill all of the robbery gang from the getaway driver, to the lookouts, and the masked robbers themselves before slipping away.In between all of these adventures, Fred and Tony go after a noted crime boss, named Roberto Pasquini (Renato Salvatori), who runs most of the crime in the city. The two cops first worm their way into the apartment of Lena (Flavia Fabiani), Pasquini's niece. Fred makes a half-hearted attempt to question the woman, but cannot resist hitting her in the face. But this appears to rouse the disturbed woman and soon the two of them are having sex in the nearby bedroom where she tells them about Pasquini's hideout.Meanwhile, the corrupt inspector reports the findings of Fred and Tony to Pasquini until he is transfered to another department after his connection to the crime boss becomes suspect.Fred and Tony travel to a river barge where one of Pasquini's gambling casinos are following the tip given to them by Lena.

However, they are saved with the arrival of the Captain who personally arrives and guns down both Pasquini and his henchmen before leaving.

Although Tom tells the sheriff that Carolee was allergic to alcohol, Skerrit won't listen.A few days later, Tom and his rancher friends prevent Crabtree's workers from bulldozing Widow Richie's property. When the foreman tells Tom that the widow's house is located on county property and it is illegal to get in his way, Tom knocks him to the ground and drives the bulldozer off the woman's land.

He gives firm instructions to the person on the other end that he wants hits on two business men. The first one is Hong Lo (Eric Lee), the proprietor or a local karate school, the other being Nathan Adams, a bank vice president.A sedan pulls up to the curb outside a high rise building, and a man carrying a satchel gets out of the car and goes inside the building and up to the roof. He pulls a rifle out of the bag and starts to take aim at Hong Lo, who is walking below nearby on his way into the karate school. The gunman tries to zero in on his target, but before he can get a shot off, he's waylaid by the Black Death Machine (BDM) who grabs his gun. The hitman pulls out a pistol and shoots the BDM, but the bullets have no effect, and the BDM continues his assault. Soon the Asian Death Machine (ADM) and the White Death Machine (WDM) all converge on the gunman hoisting him onto the ledge and then tossing him off the roof and down onto the hood of his illegally-parked car. An aging meter maid in the process of ticketing the car recoils in horror as blood spout from the gunman's mouth.(Note: From here on, the three ""Death Machines"" will be referred to as the DM's. Individually they will be referred to as WDM (White Death Machine), ADM (Asian Death Machine) and BDM (Black Death Machine.).)The phone rings and Mr. Gioretti is awakened as he lays in bed with a woman. He is incredulous at the news of his gunman falling from the building. Later that day, another hit man takes aim at the bank vice president Nathan Adams as he jogs in a park-like setting. As he's preparing to take a shot, a vehicle pulls up about fifty yards behind him. Madame Lee's assistant and her three DM's get out of the car, retrieve a bazooka from the trunk, and soon annihilate the assassin with one well-directed smoky blast.Now at his office, Mr. Gioretti takes a phone call from an associate, George. Mr. Gioretti learns that another one of his hitmen is dead -- this one ""blown up."" He engages in a heated conversation with George, who speaks to him from a phone booth. Mr. Gioretti demands to know who's killing his assassins, but George insists he doesn't know. As George loudly protests his ignorance, a bulldozer appears in the background and starts for the phone booth. After a few moments, George notices the bulldozer and starts to holler for it to stop. The driver of the renegade bulldozer is revealed as the WDM, who steers the vehicle straight for the phone booth and ultimately crushes it. A confused and angry Mr. Gioretti hears George's anguished screams over the phone line.Next, Mr. Gioretti finally receives a phone call from Madame Lee who informs him that she is the one killing his men. She tells him that in this town, if anyone wants someone killed -- they must deal with her. Although he's originally reluctant, Mr. Gioretti agrees to meet with Madame Lee, and he soon arrives in a small propeller-driven airplane at a small dirt airstrip where his driver, Mike, awaits him. They then drive to Madame Lee's mansion, and Mr. Gioretti and Mike have a nasty exchange pertaining to whether Mike should accompany Mr. Gioretti into the house. Mike is disappointed and annoyed when his boss orders him to go to ""Tony's"" to eat dinner. The reprimanded driver Mike peels out in the driveway leaving clouds of dust as Mr. Gioretti watches angrily.Mr. Lu lets Mr. Gioretti into Madame Lee's mansion and tells him to wait. Madame Lee immediately comes down the staircase, and engages Mr. Lee in some acrimonious conversation. They agree that she will supply him with a ""demonstration"" of her professionalism.Meanwhile, the driver Mike goes for dinner at ""Tony's,"" a quaint Italian eatery. As Mike sits alone in front of a large picture window eating his salad, Tony the owner brings him a plate of spaghetti, and goes into a long monologue about the quality of his food. Seconds later, when Mike tries to dig into his meal, he discovers a red Buddha buried beneath the spaghetti, and calls Tony back. Right after Tony apologizes and takes the plate away, the headlights of a huge truck appear through the picture window. It immediately heads for the restaurant, causing diners to scatter. The renegade truck drives right through large picture window and into the restaurant. All the diners rush outside, but Mike gets corralled by the three DM's. Mike fires six shots at the DM's, but to no avail since they seem impervious to bullets. The ADM soon closes in on Mike with a machete as the BDM lurks behind, carrying one large wicker basket.Meanwhile at Madame Lee's, it's now after dinner and a waiter pours more wine for her and Mr. Gioletti. She soon tells Mr. Lu that it's time to bring in her demonstration, and Mr. Lu brings in a large wicker basket and places it on the table. The waiter again freshens Mr. Gioletti's wine as the basket is opened by the confused crime boss. He's shocked to see that Inside is the severed head of his driver, Mike. Mr. Gioletti quickly pulls a revolver out of his pocket and shoots the waiter right through the bottle he's holding. Mr. Lu quickly enters the room and points a revolver at Gioletti, but Madame Lee peevishly waves him off. Mr. Gioretti and Madame Lee then agree that now they're even, and can do business. So Mr. Gioretti now gives her eight by ten photos of the two men he had previously tried to have be killed -- the Karate school owner Hong Lo and the bank vice-president Nathan Adams. Madame Lee comments that she knows that the Karate school guy is using his establishment to front drug money. She also wonders aloud why he would want the bank V.P. killed when they'll immediately be another bureaucrat to replace him. Madame Lee gives the photo of Hong Lo to her assistant who takes it upstairs and gives it to the three DM's. Mr. Lu tells them to leave no witnesses.The scene shifts to Hong Lo's Karate school where a class with about twenty students practice. Young blonde and very serious student Frank Thomas practices along with the others. Soon Hong Lo enters the class holding a small red Buddha and asks if it belongs to anyone. After no response from the class, he says that he'll just keep it. Moments later the class is suddenly disrupted by the three DM's crashing feet-first through the front windows and wreaking mayhem on the class. All the students are beaten and butchered by the relentless DM's who use their fists, feet and knives and swords that they pull off the walls. Hong Lo gets electrocuted by being shoved into a live breaker panel. Frank Thomas has his right hand brutally severed, but survives.Soon two Police detectives, the veteran Lt. Clay Forrester (Ron Ackerman) and his less-experienced partner Jerry Farnham (Edward Blair) arrive on the scene. The younger Farnham becomes nearly overwhelmed by the carnage and is visibly shaken. Other officers stroll around the corpses, checking for signs of life. The detectives rush back to the station, only to be met by the mocking attitude of detective Doyle criticizing Forrester for missing ""human relations"" classes. But then the detectives rush off to the hospital to interview the only living witness, Frank Thomas.At the hospital, the two detectives have a few words with Joe, the uniformed officer who is guarding the door to Frank's room. When they enter, they encounter a young nurse in the room. Under questioning, Frank remembers the red Buddha sent to Hong Lo, and he threatens a hoped revenge against the DM's who killed his entire class and took his hand. On their way out of the hospital, the detectives are stopped by the head nurse, who shows them that a red Buddha has been delivered for Frank.Meanwhile, at Madame Lee's mansion, her assistant Mr. Lu informs the three DM's that they left a witness alive at the Karate School massacre. He tells them that he already sent the survivor a red Buddha, and they should finish the job.At the hospital, the nurse and Frank have a discussion as to whether he should have a hook or a cosmetic hand as a prosthesis. Frank is peevish, and doesn't like either choice. After the nurse leaves, Joe sees an orderly pushing a gurney with a corpse on it down the dimly-lit hallway. The orderly is accompanied by a lab technician. As the gurney passes closely to the guard, the WDM jumps out from beneath the sheet atop the gurney and karate-chops the surprised Joe. The orderly and the lab tech are revealed to be the two other DM's, and they karate-kick Joe. The WDM enters Frank's room, shrieks, and seemingly stabs Frank in the stomach with a large knife. As the three DM's are escaping, Joe shoots the WDM in the back. The WDM gets up and Joe shoots him again, and he rises again. The third shot Joe fires is aimed for the head, and the WDM howls in pain as the bullet grazes his forehead over his right eye.Madame Lee sits and sips red wine in her mansion when Mr. Lu enters and informs her that one of her men has been injured and captured. She is incredulous and becomes angry and slaps Mr. Lu harshly across the face. She approaches the BDM, and goes to slap him too, but he intercepts her arm before she can do so. They exchange nasty glares.At the hospital, Detective Forrester and partner Farnham go in Frank's room, and congratulate themselves on their ingenuity in substituting pillows under the bedsheets instead of Frank, who had been moved to another floor.Madame Lee turns out the lights in her mansion, and ascends the staircase to her private quarters. She is surprised to find the BDM sitting in the room. She angrily informs him that he is not allowed in there, but he just sits and glares at her. He angry expression softens into a sinister smile, and she snuffs out the candle lighting the room.Forrester visits Frank at the hospital, and tells him that they're transferring him to a different facility. Forrester tells Frank that he's spoken with Frank's old boss at the bar, and he wants him back on the job. Frank agrees to go back to bartending. At the police station, Forrester is first hassled by rival detective Doyle, who tells him that the suspect from the attempted homicide at the hospital (WDM) is coming in to be interviewed by him, not Forrester. Captain Green enters and dresses-down Forrester for his slack attention to paperwork and missing his Human Relation classes.Two uniformed officers bring in the WDM, who now has a small white bandage taped on his forehead, and they escort him into an interrogation room. Doyle and his partner Rossi go in to interview him, but their suspect appears to become ill as he slowly lowers his head down onto the table. Doyle gives Rossi the okay to uncuff the suspect, and the WDM immediately goes on a rampage. He karate-kicks Doyle and Rossi, and then goes out into the office area and begins to take down all the officers there, including Forrester, Farnham and Green. One detective tries to shoot the WDM, but the suspect manages to grab his arm and deflect the shots onto another detective. Then Doyle tries to shoot the WDM, but instead hits an office worker who the WDM uses as a shield. The entire place is in mayhem, as the WDM escapes out a window and hijacks a police car that he slams into the wall of the station. He reverses his way out, and makes a three-point-turn, but crashes into another vehicle. Forrester and Farnham run out of the station hoping to recapture the suspect, but he has fled the scene.Next the WDM strolls into a sleazy roadhouse diner, and uses the payphone. He soon sits at a table and the elderly proprietor brings him a cheeseburger and a glass of water for no charge. The old man tells the WDM that he needs to find God and gives him some pamphlets. Next about a dozen bikers converge on the diner and begin to mock the WDM, calling him ""Tarzan"" and asking if he can hear. The ringleader of the gang approaches the WDM, and notices the handcuffs dangling of his wrist. The WDM starts karate-kicking the bikers, but one of them slams him onto a table which crashes onto the floor. But in through the door walk the other two DM's, who proceed to make short work of the bikers by karate-kicking them unconscious. They pick up the WDM off the floor and he recovers and walks out. The old proprietor hands the WDM the religious pamphlets as he leaves, but the WDM throws them atop a fallen biker after he kicks him in the head.Shortly thereafter, Madame Lee plays chess by herself and sips from a wine goblet. He assistant leads in all three of her reunited DM's. She suggests that they continue on with there work since Giordetti has asked her to get Nathan Adams to resign his position at the bank. She says that Giordetti wants it done without violence, and since Adams has a daughter, they should use her as ""leverage.""Nathan Adams's daughter speaks with him over the telephone. Soon Madame Lee's assistant and the three DM's enter her apartment. She screams as the DM's throw her to the floor, and the ADM removes his jacket. Mr. Lu takes out a camera and begins to photograph her.At Nathan Adams's office at the back, his secretary, Kate, buzzes him to let him know that Mr. Lu -- carrying a wicker basket -- is there to see him. The secretary sends Mr. Lu in, and Adams inquires as to what he wants to meet with him about. Mr Lu pulls out some photographs from his basket and tells Adams that ""the others in the photos are not important, but he will recognize his daughter."" Adams becomes angry and refuses to succumb to this ""cheap shakedown."" Adams suspects the Giodetti is behind this plot, and he will not resign his position. Mr Lu pulls a gun on Adams, and smacks him with it telling him to go to the filing cabinet. Mr. Lu handcuffs Adams to the filing cabinet, and goes to the basket he left on the desk. He takes out a big red Buddha with some sticks of dynamite and a timer taped to it. Mr. Lu locks the office door and bids Adams goodbye before exiting through a different door. Adams sees the bomb and begins to yell for Kate to come in and help him, but since the doors are locked, she cannot get it. He yells for her to find the key, and she rummages through her desk drawers to no avail. Kate yells to him that the keys must be in his desk, and he yells for her to go get help, and she frantically exits. Adams watches the ticker on the bomb get closer to the detonation time, and he's relieved when the bomb doesn't explode. A second later, the bomb detonates, showering the street and sidewalk in front of the bank with broken glass and debris.Back at Madame Lee's, Mr. Lu approaches her and gives her a photograph of Nathan Adams. She tosses it into the fireplace, and the two exchange knowing smiles.Frank Thomas walks through the debris at the Karate School crime scene, and he experiences some flashbacks of the three DM's breaking in. Soon Florence Nightingale enters, and they have a discussion, and decide to go back to the bar where Frank works for coffee.At the bar, an exotic dancer shakes her stuff on a small stage. An irate pool-player complains to owner Ned about the price of a one-dollar bottle of beer. Frank and Florence sit and talk at a table, when the dancer Sharon asks Frank for change. Ned sends Frank to get more beer and then he sits down with Florence to discuss Frank. He tells Florence not to give up on Frank. The irate pool-player becomes angrier when he cannot get the jukebox to work, and he starts pounding on it. Ned and Frank tell him to leave the jukebox alone, and the man slams his beer down on the bar and starts a bar fight by cracking a bottle over Ned's head. Soon another pool-player joins in and hits Frank with a pool cue. Florence stares in disbelief as the place is wrecked. The second pool-player punches Frank in the face and throws him atop the bar, where he remains unconscious. The two pool-players leave after throwing a chair through the front window. Florence hovers over Frank, shaking her head sadly.Soon thereafter, Florence and Frank kiss in his apartment. Later he tries to button his shirt with one hand as Florence lays in bed. They seem depressed, discussing changing the past, and how badly Frank wants revenge against the three DM's. Then Frank suggests that they go to a nice motel for a few days. Soon they leave the apartment with Frank carrying a small suitcase.Madame Lee next informs Mr. Lu that Giordetti will soon be arriving at the airstrip. Lu asks Lee if whether Giordetti will need the standard receipt. She says yes, and they had better give him the receipt, before he gives one to them. The three DM's descend the stairs behind her, all zipping up their matching black windbreakers. They all get into a car driven by Mr. Lu.
As Frank and Florence are driving, Frank see the three DM's go by in a car driven by Mr. Lu. Frank tells Florence to get the license plate number, and then kicks her out of the car to call Forrester. She runs to a pay phone at a roadside vegetable stand, and speaks with Forrester, who tells her to stay put. Forrester tells his partner Farnham to put a trace on the license plate number, and meet him at the car. As he's rushing out, Forrester is stopped by Captain Green who angrily wants some paperwork from Forrester, who tells him about the three DM's being spotted and adds ""Screw you!""Mr. Lo drives the three DM's to the airfield where Mike had previously picked up Mr. Gioretti, with Frank trailing him. Lo parks the car and gets out to watch a plane coming in. Frank parks nearby and runs to hide behind some tall grass and watch. The plane lands and taxis back to Mr. Lu's vehicle. Either Mr. Gioretti or a man closely resembling him, alights from the plane and hands Mr. Lu a suitcase, and then gets back into the plane. As the plane taxis away, the three DM's get out of the car and retrieve from the trunk the parts to a bazooka. They assemble it on the shoulder of the WDM, and as the plane taxis toward them, he fires off a shot that explodes the plane. Frank watches from behind the grass as the plane's wreckage burns. Mr. Lu and the three DM's all get back into the car and drive off. Frank runs back to his car and follows.Soon Mr. Lu and the DM's are parking on the street in front of Madame Lee's mansion. Frank has followed them and stealthily watches from behind his car as they enter the house. He runs through a wooded area to get a better viewpoint.Inside the mansion Madame Lee is descending the stairs as the men enter. Mr. Lu tells her that Gioretti has been taken care of. The three DM's begin to climb the stairs, rudely pushing Madame Lee in the process. She gets angry and begins to sneer before telling Mr. Lu that she thinks ""it's time to take care of those three."" Mr. Lu pulls out a pistol and starts up the stairs, just as Frank is making his way through the trees to the mansion. Mr. Lu enters the DM's room, closing the door behind him. From outside, Frank watches and he hears three gunshots. Frank then slowly creeps up to Madame Lee's door, pushes it open and enters, allowing the door to close behind him.Frank slowly walks up the stairs till he's outside the DM's room. He goes to push open that door, when suddenly it flies open and Madame Lee pounces out wielding a machete. She swings it at Frank, who backtracks and stumbles down the stairs with Madame Lee in hot pursuit. She appears to land some hits on Frank as he grunts and yells. At the bottom of the stairs, he falls out through the front door onto the step with Madame Lee right behind him swinging her machete. Just then Forrest, Farnham and Florence pull up in a car and all jump out. As Madame Lee raises the machete high in the air to strike at Frank, Farnham pulls out a gun and shoots Madame Lee in the stomach. She screams and grabs her waist just before blood starts to leak from her mouth. Florence runs up to Frank and he tells her that he's okay. Forrester walks by them into the mansion.Lt. Forrester climbs the stairs in the mansion and arrives at the top landing by the door to the DM's room. He pushes the door open and there dead on the floor with blood dripping from his mouth is Mr. Lu.Three men in stylish suits enter an airport and go up to a ticket agent who hands them their boarding passes, and tells them to enjoy their flight. The three men turn away from the counter to reveal that they are the three Death Machines. The screen freezes with their image."

Pitamber is asked to welcome him and treat him well (An airy bungalow and freedom to roam around with Geeta since he is of a progressive mentality).

For binding together the people of different origins, and different habits, for sharing the fruits of their toll and for living together happily and peacefully, code of conduct had to be evolved, which eventually turned into rules and regulations; and with that Human beings stepped into the realm of Civilization. But there were a number of clans and tribes who stubbornly refused to joins the main current of social evolution. They preferred to stick on to their age old habits and continued to live in their own way. Their life has no other meaning except, existing by any means.

"Kilma, Queen of the Amazons",1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073242/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sailor escapes a mutiny on his ship and finds himself stranded on a jungle island--with a tribe of gorgeous amazon women. Luck is with seaman Dan Robinson as he not only escapes from pirates but is able to make his way to the remote island of the Amazon, ruled by the lovely Kilma. Thanks to his bravery, her longings, and a little push from a matchmaking horse named Furia, the two fall in love. No sooner do the other Amazons find out, a cat fight ensues, and One Eye Jack's band of pirates pop up again.—Ørnås In the 19th century, aboard the Falmouth, a number of sailors mutiny, killing the captain Maxwell - allegedly too harsh in his ways - and knocking out the pilot and other sailors. One-Eye Jack nominates himself the new captain, and after a bit of commemoration of the event with rum, discovers that he can't navigate to Batavia for a career of piracy in the East Indies, because both the captain and the second-in-command are dead, and the navigator, Dan Robinson, had escaped in a paddling boat while the mutineers were commemorating with rum.The sea currents lead the pilot to an uncharted island in the South Pacific, where Robinson sees an Easter Island-type statue, and seeks shelter in a cave in the cliffs overlooking the beach. In the cave, he finds a good-sized cache of weapons, powder, and ammunition, along with the skeleton of a Spanish naval officer and his ship's log. The log isn't terribly helpful on the details, but it does establish that something on the island is fierce and deadly.Robinson gets to see just what that fierce and deadly thing is, when a boat full of Polynesian warriors lands not far from the cave, and its crew is promptly slaughtered by a horde of horse-riding, spear-wielding Amazons.Kilma, their queen, is a tall beauty with long black hair, who next is presiding the vow of a pair of virgins to their age-long creed in the Temple of Eternal Life, ""We shall always fight against men!"" A large bright blueish jewel inside a glass cover has been left them by space-faring gods, with instructions to keep it out of the hands of males at any cost.A few days after, Robinson encounters Kilma when she was wrangling horses, mounting her black stallion Fury [Furia in the Spanish version], and she ends by capturing the man with her lasso. He manages to cut off the rope with his cutlass, but then she attacks him and they fight hand-to-hand. He wins, tries to make his escape on the queen's horse, but Fury, obeying her command, throws the man down instead. The queen orders Fury to kill the man, but Robinson sees a boa constrictor about to drop onto Kilma's shoulders from the tree behind her. Robinson shouts a warning, and risking his own neck, fights and kills the big snake. Kilma is about to cut his throat anyway, while he is unconscious, but Fury breaks up her killing mood, twice. They introduce themselves by name and rank. Kilma warns him that he must disappear or be killed, but Robinson takes time to give Kilma her first kiss before escaping. She's about to go when Fury shoves her forward into a new embrace and kiss.A group of friendly Islanders ""sailed six days and six nights to bring you the tribute"" of their nation, the Foreign Chief tells the Queen, and the tribute is Anoé, their princess, a virgin ""trained in the arts of warfare, and her heart is as hard as rock"". The teenager with a soft face and thin arms is tested by Tuyu, first with spears, then with sword and shield versus a spear, and she's disarmed both times. Next, she must show how brave her heart is, while the Queen throws knives at her while she faces up to a possible injury or death. Walking with naked feet over burning logs is the ultimate test for Anoé to prove how pure her heart is. Satisfied with the results, the Queen awards Anoé with an Amazon necklace.Kilma finds herself inexplicably longing for the stranger, and she searches a new encounter with him. Fury comes alone to Robinson's cave, and makes the man follow him - to his own sailing boat, where the pilot finds fresh fruits inside. The provisions were brought to him by Kilma, who was hiding, and let's herself be captured again by Robinson's arms. She is sad that he he's going away forever, and he tries to talk her into going with him. After a kiss, Kilma plunges into the clear sea waters, and he follows her (underwater cinematography) - but on their return to the beach, there's a committee of seven Amazons, led by Tiyu, who are not pleased that their queen is happy in the company of... a man.Kilma tries to appease Tiyu, telling her that that man is not an enemy, he didn't come to their island with greed in his heart, but by chance. Tiyu wants to play safe, and gives a spear to Kilma, for her to kill the man herself. Seeing that Kilma is not going to do it, Tiyu takes another spear, and throws it at the man. Kilma deviates the flying spear with her own. Tiyu grabs a second spear from one Amazon warrior, and walks to the Queen, forcing her to fight a duel. The Queen loses her weapon, and seems about to be defeated wrestling on the sand, when Robinson picks two flintlock pistols from behind a rock he was sitting against, and steps forward. The six menacing Amazons surround him, and his pistols would only kill two of them, so he stays put. The duel goes on, both women having rearmed themselves with spears. The Queen throws her spear at Tiyu, but she evades the weapon, then Tiyu is about to spear her through the belly when Robinson shoots, and breaks the spear handle in two - to the utter amazement of the Amazons surrounding him, and Tiyu herself. Robinson makes a speech for peace on Earth, but the Amazons' attention is already directed somewhere else, as an Amazon from a viewpoint is calling the alarm with a big conch.One-Eye Jack has been searching for the missing pilot on every island, and happens now upon the right one. Robinson dissuades Kilma to attack the half a dozen pirates that are disembarking right now on another beach, saying that they probably want nothing but a provision of water, and he will talk with them. Tiyu is still not trusting the man, but accepts to go along with his strategy.Jack One-Eye is happy enough, he has the barrels full of water, and his men have recaptured Robinson. He talks the pilot into returning to the ship, and says they'll depart next day at dawn. Robinson sort of agrees, and Jack sends the Professor after him, to keep a watch on him. To be on the safe side - as the timid Professor had been a friend of Robinson, he sends Richard, a young mulatto, after the Professor, to keep an eye on him.Filling up more barrels of water, provides a man with an extra catch: the gold necklace Anoé has lost in her haste to hide when the men were reaching the stream where she had been bathing with another Amazon. Another pirate disputes his right to have it, and Jack administers justice, keeping it to himself. Only now, Robinson must confess that there are some timid women in the island. Jack wishes to add the women, and their gold, to his cargo.The Professor and the other pirate with him happen to find Anoé and her girl friend swimming at the stream, again. This time they chase the girls. The Professor is quickly knocked out, but Richard lasts longer against Anoé, that he too, ends KO. Then, they are roped, and taken prisoners, to the Amazons' village,Elsewhere in the wood, the Queen is attacked by two pirates. She's unhorsed, but Fury refuses to be mounted by one pirate, and attacks him - while Kilma fights the other two pirates. In the end, the three men return to Jack's camp, limping, and badly beaten, complaining that they had been outnumbered - one even mentions ""by one thousand giants"". Hearing this, Robinson laughs, which prompts further menaces from Jack One-Eye if he doesn't lead him to where the women's gold is. He doesn't cooperate, and is whipped by Murdoch on Jack's order, lying belly down on a rock.Kilma and another Amazon approach silently the pirates' camp, and sees the scene. Murdoch, a burly pirate with a yellow shirt, keeps whipping Robinson's back. The queen throws her spear, and seems to miss the target, but when Murdoch straightens up to look at the origin of the throw, the other Amazon throws her spear right through his chest, and he falls to his knees, groaning and dying. Two pirates shoot their flintlock pistols at the escaping Amazons, but they're already on their horses, and the shots are useless. Jack gets really mad at the men who had been beaten by two women, and pretended they were many.At the Amazons' sacred room, Kilma lectures her people on how may have been wrong about all men being evil. Tiyu has heard the Professor, in chains, claiming that Dan Robinson is a loyal person and that he had not betrayed the Amazons, but she is not accepting his statement, nor that of the queen, about men in general, or this one in particular. Reluctantly, she leaves it to the queen to give the orders.At Jack's camp, the situation has changed much: Robinson lays on his back now, limbs apart, roped to four stakes in the ground, under the sun. Jack drops some hot coffee on Robinson's hairy chest. Then, the Amazons charge on their horses against the pirates, who take a bit to react and arm themselves. After throwing their spears with little effect, the Amazons re-charge the pirate camp with swords. Kilma manages to cut Robinson's bonds, but it's on the rump of Tiyu's horse that the ship pilot escapes from the battle field. The Amazons leave only after setting fire to the pirate's stuff.Later, Tiyu is taking care of his wounds - apparently confused about her feelings for him. She tells him that the queen is by the river. He meets with her, and instructs the Amazons to recuperate an old cannon and the weapons and ammunition from the early shipwreck about which he had read the ledger book. His intention is to fortify - in a very short time - the Amazons' headquarters, an old castle. Kilma shows him a lighting stone that has been left by some foreign gods thousand of years before. After talking with the two former companions, who deny being pirates, he asks Kilma to release them from their shackles. The two men clean up and prepare the cannon to shoot.The pirates are coming after the women, but they ambush them at a ravine, retarding the pirates progress inland. Tiyu is displeased by the intimacy of Robinson with Kilma - even if it's only to teach her how to shoot a gun. The cannon shoot proves rather accurate, too. Between blade weapons, arrows, muskets, and flintlock pistols, there is another battle with losses on both sides. The fights are one-on-one or two-women-to-one-pirate killings, more than actual fighting.Tiyu ambushes Jack on her own when he was getting away from the castle, and defeats him. Only to make a deal with him: she'll show him the way into the Amazons' fortress, if he promises not to return to their land again. She tells him that the queen has betrayed the Amazons' oath, and everything has changed since Robinson has arrived on their land. Jack laughs at her reason, and sees behind her words that she is actually in love with Robinson, and jealous of the queen. She stabs at his belly, but he falls back and is not seriously wounded. Hearing the other pirates approaching, Tiyu runs away into the jungle - but wounded, she leaves a trail that the pirates follow to the secret passage.Tiyu makes a last stand against the pirates when they burst into the Amazons' sacred altar room. Jack shoots her down, and she falls dying at the altar. Robinson and the other Amazons arrive shortly after, and another battle takes place. Jack and Robinson fight a desperate duel, and Jacks knocks Robinson down. On trying to get hold of the shining bright stone, he starts a cataclysm that destroys the whole place.Happiness is for the survivors: Robinson with Kilma, Richard with Anoé, and the Professor with two Amazons. No one cares when someone sees a ship in the distance..."

When the attorneys go back to their office, they are met by the two detectives hired to watch over the witnesses.

Satan's Black Wedding,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140533/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man travels to another city for his sister's funeral to try to find out why she killed herself. He discovers that she is actually a vampire and returns from the dead to take revenge on her family. Brother and sister, Mark [Greg Braddock] and Nina [Lisa Milano] Gray, grew up together in
Monterrey, California and used to play around an old, abandoned church
near their home. Even back then, there were stories about the church once
being inhabited by renegade priests and nuns turned devil worshippers and
about children being sacrificed to Satan during Black Masses. Mark has
since grown up and moved to Hollywood to pursue an acting career. Nina
stayed in Monterrey and became a writer. It's been two years since Mark
has visited his sister, and he's now been called back to Monterrey to
attend her funeral. Nina just killed herself by slitting her wrists. Mark
cannot fathom any reason why Nina would off herself like that. At the
funeral, Mark is consoled by the attending priest, Father Dakin [Ray Myles], who
offers him whatever help he might need before returning to Hollywood. What
Mark doesn't know is that Dakin was there when Nina slit her wrists,
that Dakin is actually a 200 year old vampire, and that Nina's death
was the first step in a ritual covenant with a grim purpose that will
eventually involve Mark.Mark decides to stick around Monterrey for another week or so in
order to tie up loose ends, visit Aunt Lilian, and see whether he can
discover what might have been bothering Nina so much that she killed
herself. First stop is Nina's house, where Mark is appalled at the sight
of Nina's bedroom. There is blood everywhere. On top of that, the scene is
being investigated by police lieutenant Steve Scott, who confesses to Mark
that, in his opinion, Nina's death was not a suicide. Not only does the
blood-splattered scene NOT look like the result of a suicide, but Nina is
missing the third finger on her left hand and her body was completely
drained of blood. Lt Scott also tells Mark about a nearby family that was
recently butchered, including two children. Found in their hands were
pieces of a black cloth that the police lab dated as being 200 years old!
Something isn't adding up here.Mark's second stop is to visit Aunt Lilian, currently bedridden with
an undisclosed illness. Lilian admits that she's seen Nina only twice
since Mark left. Nina seemed to be obsessed with her book, Lilian says,
and was regularly visiting the old church, even looking forward to her
visits, which doesn't jive with Mark's memory of how afraid of the church
Nina used to be when she was a child. Nina was almost finished writing the
book, Lilian also says, but Mark can't remember seeing it anywhere in
Nina's house. Meanwhile, back at the church, Nina has reawakened as a
vampire, and Fr Dakin is sending her forth to keep up the second part of
the covenant. Nina must now kill every member of her family. To that end,
Nina kills Aunt Lilian as well as Lilian's housekeeper.After a little rooting around, Mark has found Nina's manuscript
entitled ""High Satanic Rites"" and read it from beginning to end. It talks
about how the Satan-worshipping nuns would cut off the third fingers of
their left hands, the fingers on which they wore rings of celibacy, as a
symbolic gesture of their denouncement of God and acceptance of Satan as
their lord and master. It concludes with a description of the ritual
offering of two children, ages 3 and 5, upon Satan's black altar. Upset by
the vile nature of Nina's writings, Mark pays a visit to Jean Holt, an old
girlfriend and Nina's assistant on the writing project. Jean explains that
she was involved with the writing of the book only at the beginning but
admits that she, too, was becoming concerned about Nina's ability to
describe in lurid detail events that happened over 150 years ago.In consideration of all that he has learned about the old church and
Nina's fascination with it, Mark decides to drive out there. While looking
around in the crypt, he is surprised to see Fr Dakin. Dakin explains that
he often visits the crypt, as he loves it as much as Nina did and, in
fact, he has himself become somewhat of an expert on its history. He tells
Mark how, 150 years ago, Satan appeared to a group of nuns in this very
crypt. Mark is suspicious enough that he asks Lt Scott to check on Fr
Dakin. When Jean discovers a painting of Nina that has suddenly been
altered to make Nina look like a vampire, Jean and Lt Scott both agree
that Mark should leave Monterrey. His curiosity whetted, however, Mark
intends to keep searching for the answer as to what was going on with Nina.In the meantime, while awaiting Aunt Lilian's funeral the next day,
Mark and Jean decide to spend the night at Lilian's cottage (Mark and Jean
have renewed their old relationship). As they relax in front of a fire,
Jean is spooked by Nina's face in a window, but Mark can find nothing
outside. Then Mark gets a telephone call from Lt Scott informing him that
there is no Fr Dakin in northern California. However, there once was a Fr
Daken who was the priest at the old church, but he died 150 years ago! Lt
Scott decides to check out this old church. He makes his way into the
crypt where he finds an empty coffin and is attacked by several
zombie-like vampires and impaled on dozens of stakes.The next day, Mark attends Lilian's funeral, but Jean begs off and
stays behind. In Mark's absence, Jean is attacked and bitten by Nina. When
Mark returns, Jean informs him that Fr Dakin will explain to him
everything about Nina's death and leads him into the crypt of the old
church. There, waiting for him are Nina and Fr Dakin. Dakin informs Mark
that, this very night, Satan intends to rise from hell and perform the
marriage rite that will unite Mark and Nina in unholy wedlock and produce
a horribly deformed child who will rule at Satan's side. Mark wants
nothing to do with this and tries to drive off, but Satan causes his car
to crash. Covered in blood, Mark is wed to his sister. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Redneck Miller,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314567/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"DJ Miller is a Schlitz-swilling, hard-living early morning country music disc jockey in the Southern U.S. His motorcycle, a one-of-a-kind ""chopper,"" is stolen by someone and used to steal a shipment of drugs from Supermac, a blaxploitation refugee usually aided by a hapless duo of criminals, including Preacher. Supermac sends his thugs to follow Miller, and Miller has a few run-ins with Preacher and his nameless sidekick. At first, Miller doesn't seem to take the threat seriously, although Miller's aggravation grows and he refuses to talk about what is happening with his live-in girlfriend (to her chagrin). While Miller enjoys a post-coital moment with Rachel, the wife of one of Miller's good friends, Supermac and his thugs burst in and take Rachel hostage. They threaten to rape Rachel as payback for Miller having sex with Supermac's girlfriend Pearl (Miller had sex with Pearl as ""trade"" for helping her fix a flat tire). Miller reveals that Rachel is not his girlfriend, and Supermac releases her when a struggle ensues. But he manages to take Miller's prized pick-up and chopper. Rachel demands to know whether Miller would have let them rape her, and Miller shrugs that he probably would have if it meant saving his own life. Miller confronts Supermac, and Supermac acknowledges the possibility that someone else may have stolen Miller's chopper to steal the drugs. But Supermac refuses to return the truck and chopper until Miller has gone out on the streets to find the person that has the shipment. Miller is suddenly intimidated by Supermac, so Miller borrows another DJ's car, and scours the streets. Meanwhile, Miller's girlfriend, who ostensibly has left the relationship with Miller because he doesn't tell her what is going on, has been investigating on her own based on her discovery of a zodiac medallion. She quickly suspects it belongs to Miller's chief rival, and her belief is confirmed. On the other side of town, Supermac is back in bed with Pearl, showing some vulnerability and insecurity in asking whether Pearl has any feelings for Miller since they had sex in trade for fixing a tire. Pearl reassures Supermac, and they make love. Still on the streets, and a little drunk from all the Schlitz, Miller soon learns that Preacher was involved in stealing the shipment, and he forces Preacher to reveal that Miller's rival was behind the whole thing. At the same time, Miller's rival is apparently raping Miller's (ex?-)girlfriend. He leaves just as Miller shows up. Miller chases the rival, and they have a knock-down, drag-out fight in a junkyard - even having a pocketknife fight at one point. Miller triumphs, and the rival confesses. Miller locks him in a trunk. During the fight, the rival insinuates that he has killed the girlfriend (saying, ""Nothing can bring her back.""). After the fight, Miller looks for the girlfriend, but she isn't to be found. He gets on the phone to Supermac and tells him where to find the shipment - demanding that his truck and chopper be returned ""un-mo-lested!"" Miller returns home, opens a Schlitz, and sinks into his couch. Suddenly, the girlfriend's arm reaches down from off-screen, and she looks completely unharmed and ready to renew life with Miller. A horn honks, and Miller looks outside to see Supermac waving and leaving the truck and chopper behind. The girlfriend suggests they go for a ride and the movie ends.—chrisdoc"

Leach. #1 test guinea pig I think yes. The ""Rattler"" is secretly the head of an outlaw band have been terrorizing the residents of Peaceful Valley with a crime wave of rustling, killing and robbing. The Federal Government has sent for its best 25 agents to clean up the valley. These 25 are to drift into town and meet at the Dirty Dog Saloon.—Carol Johnson <crj1@cornell.edu> Meanwhile Back At The Ranch was primarily a collaborative effort between Pack Smith and Richard Patterson in 1976. It grew out of Packy's unbounded enthusiasm for B-Westerns and his desire to make a compilation film celebrating the genre. Richard was a young filmmaker, who had recently completed a film on the life and work of Charlie Chaplin and who also had fond memories of the cowboy heroes of his childhood. Richard suggested making an affectionate tribute in the form of one preposterous B-Western made from scenes from a whole bunch of films. Packy worked up a list of 25 stars he felt needed to be included and began gathering together prints of films for each. Together they looked at over 110 films, duplicating scenes that seemed promising without any clear notion of how they would be used. Gradually an archetypal structure suggested itself, and in the end they used scenes from 78 different movies without changing a single line of dialogue. They knew they were on the right track when one of Packy's friends, who was also a B-Western collector, viewed a rough cut of the barroom brawl and said, ""I never knew Hoot Gibson and Tim McCoy made a film together.""
Needless to say the plot doesn't hold water and the backers were concerned that audiences might not get the joke. Pat Buttram's narration was added at the end of the production to help the bewildered, but Pat, of course, did get the joke and only took it to the next level.
The film was selected for a special program of compilation films at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival, but it was never released due to legal and financial problems. There were a handful of 35mm prints made at the time, and one of them was used for making a DVD in 2011.The DVD includes optional subtitles to identify the title and date of almost every clip."

The Secret of Navajo Cave,1976,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075180/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Directed by James T. Flocker, The Legend of Cougar Canyon follows the trail of two young boys travelling through the sacred Navajo land of mysterious Cougar Canyon. Their good intentions are to rescue a lost goat, but the legends and inherent dangers of the haunted canyon are not necessarily sympathetic to their presence. An eagle soaring over Cougar Canyon, Arizona, is a good omen for the canyon's Navajo inhabitants. To the Navajo, the eagle, referred to as ""the sacred one,"" is a god that can prevent natural disasters, particularly lightning, which they fear most. Among the animals the Navajo consider to be evil is the cottontail rabbit, which is believed to consort with the devil because it sometimes makes its home in gravesites. The eagle kills and eats a rabbit, and is, in turn, killed and eaten by a cougar, which now makes the cougar evil. The eagle's death angers the god of wind and rain, resulting in a storm. The canyon has no paved roads, so much of its natural splendor is hidden from the outside world. The canyon's chief predator is the cougar, although it is not necessarily the most feared. A hungry cougar stalks a badger, but the smaller animal succeeds in intimidating and driving the cougar away. Another predator is the hawk, which has remarkable eyesight, and can dive and maneuver at very high speeds. In a confrontation between a hawk and a rattlesnake, the hawk uses its keen perception and speed to overwhelm the snake. Navajo legend contains many creatures considered to be symbols of fear. Some are real, like the bear, while others are mythical, like the giant spider of Spider Rock that carries off children who disobey their parents. Residents of the canyon make their living herding sheep and goats. The breed known as ""Navajo sheep"" is unique to the U.S., and is descended from a breed introduced on the continent by Spanish settlers. Though changing times have affected the lives of other Native Americans, those of the Navajo living in the canyon have changed little since the nineteenth century. The standard Navajo dwelling is the ""hogan,"" a one-room log structure covered in soil that easily blends with the landscape. The Navajo live in harmony with nature, and consider events such as thunder, wind and rain to be gods. As night falls over the canyon, predators emerge, including the cougar, which makes an unsuccessful attack on a wild boar. The ongoing battle between predator and prey demonstrates the concept of ""survival of the fittest."" The earliest known human residents of Cougar Canyon were the Cliff Dwellers, known as the Anasazi, or ""Ancient Ones,"" by the Navajo. They carved cities, called ""pueblos,"" out of the cliffs surrounding the canyon, which protected them from invaders until the early fourteenth century, when the Anasazi were driven out of the canyon. Navajo trader Johnny Guerro arrives at the hogan of the Benally family to take them on their monthly visit to the trading post above the canyon in Chinle, Arizona. They travel eighteen miles in a four-wheel-drive truck over rough terrain before reaching Chinle, where young Steve Benally, Jr., visits with his friend, Walter Hayes, whose parents own the trading post. The next day, Steve rides to the Benally home on horseback, using the ancient Anasazi petroglyphs adorning the canyon walls as landmarks. The boys go camping in a meadow that night, and Steve tells Walter of Mummy Cave, an Anasazi pueblo where 100 Navajo warriors died in battle against Spanish settlers, many years earlier. The Navajo are forbidden from entering the cave because, according to legend, it is haunted by the souls of the dead warriors. The boys are awakened the next morning by the crow of a rooster, and after breakfast, they herd the Benally's sheep and goats up the canyon to a water hole. Steve and Walter leave the herd unattended to visit a raccoon that Steve has befriended. Meanwhile, a cougar appears at the water hole in search of a meal, and the ensuing commotion attracts the boys' attention. They scare off the cougar, round up the herd and return the animals to the corral. However, after taking a head count, they discover that a baby goat is missing and return to the water hole to find it. With the cougar in pursuit, the goat climbs the canyon wall toward Mummy Cave. The boys arrive on the scene and chase the goat around the pueblo. When Walter finally catches the goat in an Anastazi ceremonial pit, he is attacked by the cougar. Steve comes to his friend's rescue and frightens the cougar away. Steve and Walter return the baby goat to the corral, content in the belief that the gods have protected them from the evil spirits in the cave."
