Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker seeks out the ancient Yoda to learn the secrets of the Jedi, secrets Luke will need when the Dark Side of the Force beckons him in a destiny-defining duel with Darth Vader.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> In this sequel to the previous Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope, the opening crawl reveals that after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebels were forced to evacuate their base on the Yavin moon and the dreaded Imperial Fleet of the Galactic Empire has pursued the Rebel Alliance across the galaxy, forcing them to establish a secret base on the remote ice planet Hoth. Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader (David Prowse/voice:James Earl Jones) sends robotic probes in search of the base and its commander and hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).While Luke is patrolling near Echo Base, he sees what looks like a meteor hitting the ground near his location. He reports to Han Solo that he plans to investigate the fallen object but before he can ride his mount to the site, he's knocked unconscious by an indigenous, polar bear-like predator, the wampa. Back at the base, the smuggler-pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) announces his intention to leave the Rebels and pay the debt he owes to the gangster Jabba the Hutt, much to the displeasure of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). After Han discovers that Luke has not returned from patrol and with the temperature dropping rapidly, he delays his departure and leaves the base to search for him on an ostrich-like creature called a tauntaun.Meanwhile, Luke escapes the wampa's lair, using the Force to retrieve his nearby light saber and wounding the beast, but is overcome by the cold outside. He sees an apparition of his late mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), who instructs him to receive training from Jedi Master Yoda (voice:Frank Oz) on the planet Dagobah. Han finds Luke and gives him shelter, using his own tauntaun's carcass to keep Luke warm, until he can build a sturdier shelter. The two are rescued the following morning by a Rebel patrol. Luke is taken to the medical bay to heal from the wounds he received from the Wampa. In his recovery room he's met by Leia, Han and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Han jovially reminds Luke that he's rescued him twice from certain danger.Sometime later, when ground scans detect an object outside the base perimeter at Zone 12, Han and Chewie, investigate, and find an Imperial probe droid that transmits the location of the Rebel base to the Imperial fleet before firing upon Chewie. Han hits the droid with a low-energy blast but the droid activates a self-destruct function and explodes. On the bridge of Darth Vader's massive flagship, the droid's transmission is picked up by Captain Piett, but his superior, fleet Admiral Ozzel, dismisses the message until Vader sees the transmission and realizes it is the Rebel base. He overrules Ozzel and orders the Imperial Fleet to the Hoth system.Later, as the Fleet emerges from hyperspace, Vader is informed by his infantry commander, General Veers, that the Rebels have set up infantry trenches and a powerful energy shield to protect them from the Empire's orbital bombardment. Ordering Veers to launch a surface attack, Vader is furious that Ozzel has clumsily given away the element of surprise by bringing his ship out of light speed too close to the planet, and he communicates this displeasure to Captain Piett as he promotes him to admiral while Ozzel is given Vader's own fatal brand of reprimand.On the surface, the Imperial forces land their ground assault troops, a unit of over a dozen four-legged AT-AT ""walkers"" (along with a few dozen two-legged AT-ST walkers) beyond the energy shield and Luke leads his squadron of flying speeders into battle. Realizing that their blasters cannot damage the heavily armored walkers, Luke devises an attack plan that has his squad using their towing cables to bind the legs of the walkers to trip them, making them more vulnerable. A few walkers are destroyed but the Imperial forces eventually overpower the Rebels and destroy the generator powering the energy shield, capturing the Rebel base. Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and their droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee on board the Millennium Falcon. Luke makes it back to the base after personally destroying one of the walkers and speeds off in his X-Wing fighter with astromech droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).In space, Han discovers that the Falcon's hyper-drive is damaged and it cannot escape the Imperial blockade in space. During the confusion, they enter the nearby Hoth asteroid field, pursued by four Imperial TIE-Fighters; Han Solo pilots the Millennium Falcon deeper into the field, and the four pursuing fighters are destroyed by the flying rocks. Han lands the Falcon inside a crater on one of the larger asteroids to hide and make repairs.Meanwhile, Luke and R2-D2 make a crash landing on the swamp planet of Dagobah. Frustrated at his X-Wing having landed in a bog, Luke makes camp and begins to eat his rations. Luke muses about how the surrounding area seems familiar when he's startled by a strange voice behind him, a wizened, green little creature who acts obnoxiously, demanding to keep a small power lamp of Luke's and criticizes the rations Luke eats. Telling Luke that he knows where to find Yoda, Luke goes to his small house to eat. While there, Luke quickly grows impatient, wanting to meet Yoda immediately. The small creature begins to talk to the spirit of Obi-Wan, saying that Luke is too old to begin Jedi training and that he hasn't learned the patience a Jedi requires. Luke realizes that the creature is Yoda himself. Yoda insists that Luke harbors much anger like his father, Anakin. Obi-Wan assures Yoda that Luke will learn patience and will complete his training. Luke tells Yoda that he is not afraid, to which Yoda gravely replies, ""You will be.""The Star Destroyer 'Avenger' moves through the massive asteroid field, searching for the Millennium Falcon. A group of TIE Bombers moves across the massive asteroid where the Falcon is hiding, and they release high-yield concussion bombs on the surface, trying to scare out the Falcon. The noise awakens Leia, who has fallen asleep in the cockpit.Inside the asteroid cave, Han Solo and Princess Leia argue while repairing the ship, eventually leading to a tender kiss. At the same time, Vader orders the Star Destroyer 'Avenger' to continue searching the asteroid field for the Falcon, despite it's captain's assumptions that the ship was destroyed. Vader later confers with the powerful Galactic Emperor Palpatine, about a new threat to the Empire - Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader suggests that if Luke could be turned, he would become a great ally to the Imperial cause. The Emperor asks, 'Can it be done?'; Vader simply replies, 'He will join us, or die, my Master'.While resting in the Falcon's cockpit, Leia is scared by an ugly creature on the ship's windows. Han, Leia and Chewbacca all venture outside the ship in breathing masks to investigate. Leia notices that the ground has a strange consistency and Han suddenly shoots one of the beasts Leia saw off the ship. As he suspected, they are mynocks, parasitic creatures feeding on the Falcon's power cables. When Chewie tries to shoot one and misses, the whole cave rocks with a loud rumble. Suspicious, Han shoots the ground and the cave becomes more unstable. As they board the ship and race out they see that the mouth of the cave is actually the jaws of a titanic space slug. Han manages to escape as the creature takes another hungry snap at the ship.On the bridge of the Avenger, Darth Vader gathers a small group of intergalactic bounty hunters, the most feared of whom is Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch). Vader promises them a large payoff if they can find the Millennium Falcon.In space once again, the Falcon is again chased by a Star Destroyer, but Han evades pursuit cleverly and stealthily: after soaring into an attack position, he flies directly over the bridge of the star destroyer and hides the Falcon on the massive ship's surface, attaching to it with the Falcon's landing claws. They go undetected while Han figures out an escape plan. He surmises that the fleet will dump their refuse before jumping to hyperspace and they can float away unnoticed. Han checks his navigational log and realizes he's been in the area before and that a planet called Bespin is nearby and that they'll find one of his old smuggling buddies there who will offer them refuge. Unfortunately, their escape is not unanticipated; following just behind him is a smaller ship, Slave I, piloted by Fett who is working out where the Millennium Falcon is likely going. Han's escape plan works and he sets course for Cloud City, a gas mining colony on the nearby gas planet of Bespin, which is run by Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).On Dagobah, Luke undergoes Yoda's rigorous lessons about the metaphysical nature of the Force involving levitating objects, performing acrobatic feats and meditation to promote calm and see possible visions of the future. Yoda brings Luke to an old, gnarled tree that sits atop a cave. Yoda tells his apprentice that the cave is powerful with the dark side of the Force and that Luke must explore it. Somewhat distrusting of his master, Luke takes his light saber with him. Inside the cave, Luke encounters a vision of Darth Vader, whom he fights. Luke cuts off Vader's head with his light saber, but then the mask bursts open, revealing Luke's own face behind it. The cave is another test, one that carries a warning for Luke to control his impulses and anger or he'll end up like Vader himself.Luke has a vision of Han and Leia in danger and agony. Luke wants to rescue them, but Yoda and the ghost of Obi-Wan warn of the dangers of rashly leaving, because Luke is still susceptible to the powerful temptation of the Dark Side. Nevertheless, Luke departs from Dagobah and promises Yoda he will return to complete his training.Upon their arrival at Cloud City, Han's party is welcomed by Lando Calrissian. After agreeing to help Han repair his ship, Lando invites him and the others to a meal. C3PO is distracted from the group when he hears the familiar beeping of an R2 unit. Entering a small room, he is suddenly confronted by an unseen person why he's in the room. A laser blast cuts C3PO down as he babbles to his attackers. Only Chewbacca is suspicious, but he arrives on the scene too late to see what happened.When Han's party enter the dining room, they are captured by Darth Vader, along with Boba Fett who had tracked them to Cloud City. Lando insists he was forced to conspire with the Empire to prevent them from occupying (or likely destroying) the city.In captivity, Han is tortured to lure Luke to the city. Chewbacca is also tortured in his holding cell by an amplified screeching sound. As Vader prepares to wait for Luke to be lured to him by his friends' agony, he tells Lando that the rebels must never leave the city. Lando, disgusted by Vader's treatment of Han and his friends, protests that the deal they struck never included that as a condition any more than handing Han over to Boba Fett. However, when Vader threatens to leave a garrison in the city if Lando keeps complaining, Lando is forced to realize how helpless he is.Vader orders a carbon-freezing chamber prepared to freeze Luke, which will hold him in suspended animation for transport to the Emperor. The process is tested on Han Solo. As Han is lowered into the machine, Leia declares her love for him. He is frozen in carbonite and alive in hibernation and handed over to Fett, who intends to return his quarry to Jabba the Hutt for a large reward.Meanwhile, Luke lands at Cloud City and is lured into the carbon-freezing chamber. Luke meets Vader and a ferocious lightsaber fight ensues. While escorting their prisoners, Vader's Imperial troopers are intercepted by Lando's private security force, who set Lando and the others free. Lando, despite nearly being killed by a furious Chewbacca, insists that there is still a chance to save Han, and along the way they find R2-D2. The group pursues Boba Fett and Han's frozen form through Cloud City, but arrives just as the bounty hunter's ship flies away. After a desperate chase from Imperial troops, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the two droids make their escape on the Millennium Falcon.As the Falcon leaves Cloud City, Luke is trapped on the bottom level of the carbon-freezing room. As he heads down a dark hallway Vader ambushes him, stepping out of a doorway and swinging his light saber down. Vader and Luke's fierce light saber duel brings them to a narrow platform above the city's central air shaft. The Dark Lord corners Luke on a catwalk, threatening him; 'You are beaten! It is useless to resist!' Luke resumes the fight; Vader suddenly cuts an instrument panel apart. As Luke unwittingly glances at it, Vader slashes off Luke's right hand at the wrist, disabling him and sending Luke's light saber tumbling into the huge shaft. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader informs Luke that he does not yet know the truth about his father. Luke claims that Vader killed him. Vader answers:""No, I am your father.""Luke screams in denial. Vader tries to persuade Luke to join him, embrace the Dark Side of the Force, and overthrow the Emperor with him. Luke refuses, lets go, and falls off the platform into the abyss, signifying that he would rather die than join him. In free fall, Luke is sucked into an air vent, shoots out of the underbelly of the floating city, and lands on an antenna hanging beneath. Luke tries to pull himself back into the exhaust pipe, but with only one hand and no strength left, he is unable to pull himself up and the hatches close over his head, trapping him on the weather vane. He pleads for help from Ben, but the old Jedi Knight will not appear. Luke then attempts to reach out to Leia, using the Force.On the Millennium Falcon Leia senses Luke's distress through the Force and orders Lando to pilot them back to Cloud City -- Lando protests immediately but Chewbacca's roar convinces him to do so. As they approach the underside of the city, Lando spots Luke hanging on to the weather vane and opens the Falcon's outer hatch. Luke falls off the weather vane and Lando pulls him in just as the three TIE fighters from the 'Executor' appear, and start a rapid pursuit. As they leave Cloud City, they are pursued by Darth Vader's flagship. R2-D2, who discovered that the hyper-drive was merely deactivated while searching the city's central computer, reactivates it and the Falcon escapes into hyperspace. Aboard the flagship, Admiral Piett fears Vader will kill him for this failure, but the Sith Lord simply walks away silently.In the final scene, the fugitive and defeated rebel fleet has assembled in a point beyond the galaxy to decide their next move. Aboard a Rebel medical frigate, Luke is fitted with an artificial hand as Lando and Chewbacca set out in the Falcon to locate Han Solo with Luke arranging to join them when he is released from medical care. Luke and Leia watch the ship speed off toward the galaxy."
Superman II,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Superman agrees to sacrifice his powers to start a relationship with Lois Lane, unaware that three Kryptonian criminals he inadvertently released are conquering Earth. Picking up where ""Superman: The Movie"" left off, three criminals, General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa, (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) from the planet Krypton are released from the Phantom Zone by a nuclear explosion in space. They descend upon Earth where they could finally rule. Superman, meanwhile, is in love with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), who finds out who he really is. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) escapes from prison and is determined to destroy Superman by joining forces with the three criminals.—Keith Howley <lald@ptdprolog.net> Terrorists have taken over the Eiffel Tower, and threaten to blow it up with a hydrogen bomb. Once again, Superman is there and saves Paris by throwing the bomb into outer space. Unfortunately, the explosion releases the three bad guys,General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa, (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) imprisoned in the first Superman movie. They then move in on Earth, taking it over, but little do they know who they will have to defeat.—ahmetkozan The meta-human heritage of the Last Son Of Krypton is tested as never before when a series of misadventures unlocks in Superman a very human emotion - love. Superman's love for journalist Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) reaches a seemingly impossible peak, but requires the ultimate sacrifice - as the incompatible molecular structure of Kal-El (Superman's birth name) and Lois would gravely complicate the inevitable bearing of children, Kal-El must be purged of his superpower, to live as a mortal. Kal-El, despite the pleas of the spirit of his long-lost mother, willingly agrees, and now a normal human being, consummates his love for Lois - a decision that dooms the Earth as three criminals from Krypton, freed from their extra-dimensional prison, lay waste to the planet in a path of conquest aided by the planet's most arrogant criminal, Lex Luthor, who intends to smoke out Superman for his destruction - unaware as he is of The Man Of Steel's helplessness, a condition that only one last hope can rectify.—Michael Daly A group of terrorists seize the Eiffel Tower & threaten Paris with a hydrogen bomb if the French government does not meet their demands. Superman immediately heads to Paris, where he launches the elevator carrying the bomb into outer space before it can detonate. Unfortunately, when the bomb explodes, it disintegrates the 'Phantom Zone', where 3 Kryptonian criminals, ,General Zod (Terence Stamp), Ursa, (Sarah Douglas), and Non (Jack O'Halloran) who had been imprisoned years before by Jor-El. Immediately, the 3 criminals, led by the psychopathic General Zod, head to Earth with the intention of enslaving the people Superman protects. The Man of Steel, however, is unaware of their arrival, and is forced to sacrifice his powers for a life with Lois Lane. When he finds out about Zod & his companions, Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude to regain his powers and confront the horrible Kryptonian criminals - on his terms. Can Superman defeat the 3 villains who are armed with identical powers to his own?—Derek O'Cain Prior to the destruction of Krypton, the criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non disable a security guard at a crystalline matrix table. The general removes a red spire from the table and destroys it; the thunderclap as the piece is shattered resonates through the city and sets off a trap that ensnares the three brigands. The red spire's destruction is clearly an act of treason, and for this and other crimes they are sentenced by Jor-El and the Krypton council to banishment into the Phantom Zone.On Earth, in the present day, Clark Kent arrives at the Daily Planet for work. He talks to his editor Perry White, who's working on the latest cover story. Kent asks Perry what's going on and Perry tells him a small group of terrorists are holding hostages at the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris and are threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb. Perry had sent his ace reporter, Lois Lane, to Paris on a Concorde jet to get the story. Kent leaves the Planet building, ducks into an alley and transforms into Superman, flying off to Paris.At the Eiffel Tower, Lois is able to sneak past security and stows away on the bottom of the elevator that brings the hostages down from the top. When a French commando team determines the hostages are safe and they believe the terrorists have taken the bomb out of the elevator, they cut the power and destroy the chain drive. The elevator plummets, taking the bomb and Lois with it. Superman arrives and stops the car, helping Lois off. He then flies the car out into space, past the Moon, where it explodes.The Phantom Zone is nearby and cracked by the shockwave. The three criminals are freed, finding themselves with super powers granted by the yellow light of Earth's sun. After attacking human astronauts on the moon and the small town of East Houston, Idaho, the three travel to the White House and force the President of the United States to surrender to Zod (on behalf of the entire planet) during an international television broadcast. When the President warns Zod that Superman will stop them, Zod announces his demand for Superman to come and ""kneel before Zod!""Prior to Zod's arrival, Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent on assignment for the Daily Planet to Niagara Falls. Lois becomes suspicious that Clark is Superman and tries to lure him into revealing his identity by throwing herself into the Niagara River gorge downstream, but Clark manages to save her with subtle use of his powers. That night, Clark accidentally reaches into the room's fireplace to recover his glasses after he trips; when Lois discovers his hand isn't the slightest burnt, Clark is forced to admit he is Superman.Superman takes her to his Fortress of Solitude near the North Pole and shows her the traces of his past stored in the energy crystals of the Fortress, one of which is the green crystal that created the Fortress and opened Superman's contact with his long-deceased parents. Lois misplaces the green crystal under her purse. Superman, talking to a hologram of his mother, Lara, decides to undergo a transformation to make himself human by exposing himself to the red Kryptonian sunlight to become romantically closer to Lois, despite Lara's warnings. The process destroys many of the energy crystals, except the green crystal, lying a considerable distance away. After spending the night together, the two return to populated areas by conventional means.In a remote truck stop, Clark becomes the target of a brash, bullying trucker who beats him up. Clark realizes he's just as vulnerable as a human, shocked by the sight of his own blood. Suddenly, he and Lois see a live broadcast of Zod with the US President, demanding that Superman reveal himself and kneel to Zod. Realizing that humanity cannot fight Zod themselves, Clark decides to return to the Fortress to try to reverse the transformation. His hike to the Fortress is nearly impossible and one he arrives, he admits to his father that he made a grave mistake and that his adopted homeworld is in more danger than ever. As he's ready to give up, he notices the green crystal lying nearby.Lex Luthor, who has managed to escape from jail (with Eve Teschmacher's assistance), has tracked down the Fortress using an alpha wave detector, and infiltrated the Fortress before Superman and Lois arrived, learning from the crystal of Superman's mother of Superman's connection to Jor-El and of General Zod. He traces Zod to Washington, D.C., and offers to lead Zod to Jor-El's son in exchange for control of Australia. Accepting his offer, the three Kryptonians are directed by Luthor to the offices of the Daily Planet where they abduct Lois. Though Zod is initially disappointed, Luthor convinces him that any threat to Lois will bring Superman to her aid.Superman arrives, after having reversed his transformation process, and attempts to fight the three. The battle wages over much of Metropolis with Superman courageously holding his own until Zod realizes Superman cares for the innocent humans and take advantage of this weakness. To protect Metropolis, Superman flies off in retreat. Zod declares his victory but Luthor scoffs until he reveals that he knows the location of the Fortress of Solitude. Zod, Ursa, and Non fly to the Arctic, taking Luthor and Lois with them.At the Fortress, Superman attempts to lay one last trap to stop Zod but fails and stops his fight with the three when they threaten to kill Lois. Knowing that the three Kryptonians pose a threat to the entire world, Luthor listens as Superman tells him to try and trick them all into the crystal chamber that will transform them into humans. Zod catches on and forces Superman to enter the chamber himself. Luthor himself initiates the process by placing the green crystal in the remaining control panel. While Superman is in the transformation chamber, the rest of the Fortress is bathed in red light. Zod demands that Superman kneel to him and take his hand. Superman slowly crushes Zod's hand in his and flings him into a pit. Luthor realizes that Superman had reversed the power of the chamber to protect him and transform the criminals. Non, unable to fly, falls into the pit and Lois punches Ursa, who suffers the same fate as her comrades.Superman returns Luthor to the authorities, despite the criminal's pleas that he was in on his plan. Superman returns Lois to her home. At the Daily Planet the following day, Superman (as Clark) kisses Lois, using his telepathic abilities to wipe Lois' mind of all the events surrounding Zod's arrival on Earth including her knowledge that Clark and Superman are the same person. At the truck stop where he was beaten up by the bullying driver, Clark takes revenge on the bullying truck driver who assaulted him.Superman restores the damage done by Zod, and as he replaces the flag on top of the White House, promises the President to never again abandon his duty."
9 to 5,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080319/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three female employees of a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot find a way to turn the tables on him. Meet Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman). The biggest ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" boss on the planet. He thrills in taking advantage of his head female office staff; humiliating, downplaying, and condescending against them whenever conveniently possible, particularly his top assistant Violet (Lily Tomlin). Long-exhausted over his gruesome bullishness, Violet, alongside co-workers Doralee (Dolly Parton) and Judy (Jane Fonda) comprise comical methods of ""doing him in"", when a freak incident occurs. They then manage to kidnap Hart and trap him in his own house, while assuming control of his department, and productivity leaps. But just how long can they keep him tied up?—Peanutlee <oprlvr@yahoo.com> On the first day of the secretary Judy Bernly at the Consolidated Companies, the senior office supervisor Violet Newstead is in charge to introduce her to the coworkers. Judy was a housewife that has never worked but after her recent divorce, she is forced to find a job. Violet explains that their boss Franklin Hart Jr. is a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot and his secretary Doralee Rhodes is his mistress. When Violet develops a method to increase the profit of the company, the opportunist Franklin backstabs Violet and presents the wok as if he had made it. Later the chauvinist Franklin does not promote Violet. He also spreads rumors about Doralee and mistreats Judy. When Violet accidentally put rat poison in Franklin's coffee, he has an accident with his chair, hits his head on the floor, loses consciousness and drops his coffee on the floor. He goes to the hospital and Violet and her friends believe he had died. When Franklin returns to the office, his snitch learns what happened and he blackmails the secretaries that kidnap him. Now Violet administrates the office with Judy and Doralee and they discover that Franklin is stealing Consolidated Companies. How can they prove?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film centers on the friendship between three women who work in the offices of a large corporation known as Consolidated Industries. Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is a naïve new employee whose husband Dick (Lawrence Pressman) recently left her for his secretary. On her first day, Judy meets Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin), the supervisor of her department, and a longtime employee. Violet trains Judy and introduces her to the department executive, Franklin Hart, Jr. (Dabney Coleman), who immediately reveals himself to be arrogant and sexist. Judy soon learns that despite the fact that Violet has worked there for over 10 years, she has been passed over consistently for promotion and in fact has seniority over Hart. Violet also introduces Judy to the staff, including mail room clerk Eddie (Ray Vitte), alcoholic secretary Margaret Foster (Peggy Pope), and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant and his eyes and ears in the office, eavesdropping on private conversations.The third woman in the trio is Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton), Hart's personal secretary. Despite the fact that Doralee is happily married to a construction worker and part-time country-western singer named Dwayne (Jeffrey Douglas Thomas), and Hart is also married to a sweet but oblivious woman named Missy (Marian Mercer), Hart continually makes inappropriate advances toward Doralee, pushing her patience and tolerance to the limit. Hart has also been lying to his colleagues that he's been sleeping with Doralee, causing office gossip to go wild. As a result, the other women in the office treat her rudely and initially Judy shuns Doralee's attempts to be friendly.Some time passes, and Violet is once again passed over for an important promotion, even though her ideas are good enough that Hart passes one off as his own and takes all the credit for it. When Violet protests to Hart that he passed her over for a promotion because she is a woman, Hart bluntly tells her that the company would rather have a man in the position, and Violet becomes enraged, storming off on her own, but not before she reveals to Doralee that her affair with Hart is common knowledge. Doralee, who has been confused and upset about the way she's treated by her coworkers, snaps, and also rages at Hart, threatening to use her gun on him the next time he makes an indecent proposal.Angry and upset by Doralee's outburst, Hart takes it out by firing Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini), a dedicated employee (due to an infraction overheard by Roz, who had been eavesdropping in the ladies' room). After witnessing the incident, Judy joins Violet and Doralee in storming out of the office.The three women converge at a local bar to drown their sorrows, when Violet discovers a marijuana cigarette that her son left in her purse as a gift. They return to Doralee's house and smoke it together, prompting each of them to have a detailed fantasy about how they would take down Hart if they had the chance.Judy imagines a scenario where she's a great white hunter who hunts down Hart in the office with a shotgun.Doralee's fantasy is of her as a cowgirl who turns the tables on Hart and sexually harasses him before hog-tying him and roasting him alive on a spit.Violet envisions a fairy tale where she is a Snow White-type character who poisons Hart's coffee and sends him falling to his death from his office window, which suddenly releases scores of oppressed ""prisoners"" chained to their desks.Things take a sudden bizarre turn the next day when each of the women's fantasies comes true in some odd respect: Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee, having mistaken a box of rat poison for artificial sweetener. Before Hart can drink it, he falls from his unstable chair and knocks himself unconscious on his credenza desk in his office. Doralee finds him, summons an ambulance, and accompanies him to the hospital.At first the women have no clue what happened to Mr. Hart, but then Violet finds the rat poison, realizes what she did, and they all assume the reason Hart blacked out was because he drank the poisoned coffee. At the hospital, Hart, who has regained consciousness, leaves on his own without being seen -- the penny-pinching Hart saying that the hospital and doctors want to charge him a small fortune for nothing -- and the three women mistake a dead police witness for their boss, steal the dead body (to prevent an autopsy), stash it in the trunk of Violet's car, and drive off. After they get into a minor car accident, they discover they've stolen the wrong body, so they smuggle it back into the hospital. After shaking off a suspicious police officer, the three women dispose of the body by taking it back to the hospital and leaving it in a wheelchair in a restroom.The next day, they discover that Hart wasn't harmed at all, but their discussion about the incident is overheard by Roz. At the end of the day, Hart tries to use the information to blackmail Doralee into having an actual tryst with him. Doralee loses her temper and hog-ties Hart with telephone wires when he threatens to call the police (just like in her fantasy), and Judy fires on Hart with Doralee's pistol when he persuades her to untie him after promising he won't carry out his threat (similar to her fantasy).With Hart's wife away on a lengthy cruise, the women decide to kidnap Hart and imprison him in his own home until they can somehow get him to cooperate and forget the whole incident. But the cold and misogynist Hart refuses to listen to them and vows to blackmail them. Looking for a way to keep him quiet, Violet discovers that Hart has been embezzling money from Consolidated by illegally selling inventory from a company-owned warehouse and keeping the profits. The women plan on using the information to blackmail Hart to keep him from calling the police.After purchasing a series of items, including a skydiving harness, chains, dog collars, and a remote-controlled garage-door opener to keep Hart confined in his own house, the women return to work after the weekend as usual while Violet sends for an order of the warehouse inventories as proof of Hart's embezzlement scheme. The three women work together to make Hart's absence in the office as inconspicuous as possible.After a few weeks of the ruse working, Judy learns from the head office in New York City that, because of a computer system change, the office will not send them the invoices for between four to six weeks. Violet and Judy are crestfallen but Doralee thinks they can continue the subterfuge for that long.From there, the trio work to make several changes around the office, with Doralee able to forge Hart's signature on several memos: flexible work hours, equal pay for male and female employees, a job-sharing program, and even an onsite daycare center for employees with children. The trio learns that Hart's so hated around the office (by male and female employees alike) that the only person to question his absence is Roz, whom Violet sends away to Europe for a immersive multi-week training program to learn French. Hart's archaic and oppressive rules are done away with, employee morale improves greatly and productivity improves as well.One night, Hart almost escapes when he finds a nail file in the bathroom that his captors overlooked and tries cutting his restraints. Using the restraining system they'd installed in Hart's bedroom, Judy is able to render him helpless while he hangs from the ceiling. Judy is further surprised when her ex-husband, Dick, shows up at Hart's house after following her there and asks to reconcile with her. But when Hart makes a noise, Judy is forced to restrain him, and seeing the captive Hart tied up, her ex-husband mistakenly assumes that Judy is having an affair with her boss and leaves, claiming that they are now over and will never get back together.Later, Hart is accidentally freed when Missy returns early from her cruise, and for three days, he quietly buys back all the items he sold and puts them back in the Consolidated warehouse. Doralee only learns about Missy's return when Missy calls her to thank her for her sending her flowers in Hart's name, which is why she returned from her vacation early. Doralee hurries to Hart's house to find the freed Hart now holding Judy captive.After taking them to the office to meet with Violet, Hart plays his final card, boasting that women never can defeat him and that he'll see them all sent to jail. Just then a sudden visit from the reclusive and ruthless Chair of the Board, Russell Tinsworthy (Sterling Hayden), interrupts him. To the cold and unfeeling Hart's chagrin, he finally sees that Violet, Judy, and Doralee have made some radical changes in the office during his captivity, and the sudden surge in productivity has caught Tinsworthy's attention. Where Hart had bristled at the changes in the office -- job-sharing, flexible hours, new, disabled employees working alongside veteran ones, a drying-out program for alcoholic workers (Margaret Foster's no longer an alcoholic, thanks to the company's alcohol rehab program, and Maria's back with the company on a part-time basis and sharing her workload with another employee) -- Tinsworthy congratulates Hart for the increased morale.Since the women did all of it under the false approval of Hart, they can take no credit for it, but fate seems to be on their side: Tinsworthy ""rewards"" Hart for his good work by immediately removing him from his position and sending him to work on a special project in Brazil, much to the amusement and delight of Violet, Doralee, and Judy, as now they are free from Hart, who will never try to destroy them without destroying his own career.In the final scene, Roz returns from her training and is stunned to discover Violet, Judy, and Doralee celebrating in Hart's office.In a postscript at the end, it is revealed that Violet took Hart's place as vice president of Consolidated, Judy married the Xerox technician and quit the company, Doralee also quit the company and moved back to her Tennessee hometown, where she became a country music singer (just like the actress that played her), and Hart was kidnapped by natives during a trip in the Amazon and was never seen or heard from again."
Stir Crazy,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081562/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set up and wrongfully accused, two best friends are sent to prison for a crime they didn't commit. However, no prison cell can keep them locked in a cage. Skip and Harry are framed for a bank robbery and end up in a southwestern prison. The two eastern boys are having difficulty adjusting to the new life until the warden finds that Skip has a natural talent for riding broncos, and the inter-prison rodeo is coming up soon.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> When Skip and Harry decide that they've had enough of New York City, they decide to head to the blue skies and sunshine of California. Taking a job as promoters in a bank, they get falsely accused of bank robbery and are sent to a tough jail where they form unlikely friendships and find themselves in the prison rodeo. To start afresh, down-on-their-luck best friends, aspiring playwright Skip Donahue and would-be actor Harry Monroe, leave bustling New York City for sunny Arizona. Instead, they end up in court, and then behind bars for a crime they didn't commit. Having no chance of reducing their sentence, fate smiles upon the unfortunate duo when one of them discovers an unexpected talent as a rider taming bucking broncos. As the intense rivalry between prison wardens brings the natural-born cowboy into the spotlight for the annual inter-prison rodeo tournament, Skip and Harry devise a daring escape plan to walk as free men once more. But is luck on their side?—Nick Riganas Writer Skip Donahue (Gene Wilder) and actor Harry Monroe (Richard Pryor) are fired from their jobs in New York, and leave for Hollywood to find a new way to make a living. Along the way, they take odd jobs to make ends meet. In one such job, Skip and Harry dress up as two woodpeckers, performing a song and dance routine as part of a promotion for a bank. Harry and Skip remove their costumes to take a break, and two men who have been watching steal the costumes and perform the routine as though they were Harry and Skip. The men then use the costumes to rob the bank, and in the confusion Harry and Skip are immediately arrested, whisked through a absurd speedy trial and handed 125-year jail sentences. Their court-appointed lawyer, Len Garber (Joel Brooks), advises them to wait until he can appeal their case.Life in a maximum-security prison proves difficult for both Skip and Harry. After a failed attempt at faking insanity, they make friends with Jesus Ramirez (Miguel Ángel Suárez), a real bank robber, and Rory Schultebrand (Georg Stanford Brown), a gay man who killed his stepfather. Rory takes an immediate fancy to Harry, much to Harry's chagrin. Having been there a while, Jesus and Rory inform Skip and Harry of the numerous goings-on in the prison, as well as the other members and who to watch out for, such as Jack Graham (Jonathan Banks), who runs the cell block, and is in charge of the contraband that comes in; and ax murderer Blade (Charles Weldon), who runs the ""third-world"" side of the cell block. The most feared inmate, however, is Grossberger (Erland Van Lidth), a convicted mass murderer of incredible size and strength who refuses to speak and is feared by the inmates and guards alike. Seeing something ""kind"" in Grossberger, the naive Skip attempts to talk with him, unsuccessfully.After being in prison for three months, Skip and Harry are brought to see Warden Walter Beatty (Barry Corbin) and Deputy Warden Wilson (Craig T. Nelson), the head guard. They wish to run a ""test"" with Harry and Skip on a mechanical bull in the warden's office. To everyone's surprise, Skip rides the bull at full power, so Beatty selects him to compete in the prison's annual rodeo competition.Out in the yard, Jesus and Rory inform Harry and Skip of the truth behind the rodeo: it's really a crooked operation run by Beatty and Warden Henry Sampson (Nicolas Coster), who heads the neighboring prison. The money from the rodeo, which is supposed to go to the prisoners, really ends up in the wardens' pockets. Knowing that Skip will be selected as the prison's new ""champion"", Jesus and Rory hatch a plan for escape. In order for it to work, Skip must refuse to participate in the rodeo: the longer he holds out, the better chance he has at ""striking a deal"" with the warden. After Skip refuses to participate, the angry warden orders Deputy Wilson to ""straighten him out"", which Wilson is only too happy to do.Prison life soon becomes more difficult than ever for Harry and Skip as Wilson and the guards attempt to break them down. First they are put on hard labor detail and deprived of both water and sleep. When this fails, the guards lock Skip up, overnight, hanging by his wrists and ankles. Skip awakens the next morning to discover that his bad back is cured. Wilson then puts Skip in solitary confinement; Skip asks for an extra day. Being returned to his cell, Skip discovers that he and Harry have a new cell mate: Grossberger, whom they quickly befriend.Harry and Skip are visited by Garber, along with his cousin Meredith (JoBeth Williams), who is fighting to prove their innocence. Skip takes an immediate liking to Meredith, who informs him she never gets personally involved with clients.Meanwhile, Warden Beatty is furious at Wilson for not breaking Harry and Skip yet, and decides to handle things himself. Soon afterward, Harry is sent to the prison's hospital ward for appendicitis. A prisoner in the neighboring bed (Franklyn Ajaye) tells Harry of the horrors of the ward: he himself was admitted for a hernia operation, and the doctor castrated him in the process. As soon as Harry sees the doctor (Alvin Ing), he runs screaming from the ward.Skip meets with Warden Beatty to make a deal. In exchange for Skip's participation in the rodeo, Skip requests his own crew (Harry, Jesus, Rory, and Grossberger), along with a much bigger jail cell, all according to the plan. Warden Beatty agrees, telling Deputy Wilson to have an inmate guard watch them at all times. Willson assigns Graham and Blade to the task, who anxiously voice their resentment: Graham, who resents being ""pushed aside"" for Skip, and Blade, who regard the group as ""brown-noses"". Wilson tells Graham of his own agenda: Skip will not leave the rodeo alive.Training Skip and Harry for the rodeo, Graham ensures that their lives - especially Harry's - are made difficult. While practicing for the rodeo, Skip, Harry, Jesus, Rory and Grossberger acquire the numerous tools they require for their escape, using the prison's metal shop to transform them into seemingly everyday items. In their new large jail cell, the quintet have numerous comforts: books, a television, a radio, and a guitar, among other things. While relaxing in their cell, Grossberger breaks his silence when he sings ""Birmingham Jail"" during an awkward moment.Meanwhile, Meredith has gotten a job as a waitress in a country western strip club, so she may search for possible suspects. When she meets the real crooks - recognized by a tattoo on one of their hands that a witness (Tracy Lee Rowe) saw on one of them - Meredith calls Len Garber, and the police.The rodeo begins, and Skip, Harry, Jesus, Rory and Grossberger all perform their tasks flawlessly, arousing no suspicions, in spite of Wilson and Graham's attempt to kill Skip: Graham spikes a horse Skip is riding, but Skip manages to stay on the horse and dismount, unhurt. Graham then puts a lock on the gate, trapping Skip inside with an out-of control bull, but Grossberger breaks the lock off, allowing Skip out through the chute with the bull. During every major event when everyone is distracted, one of them slips out through a secret opening, taking them through air vents to either a restroom, where Jesus' wife Teresa (Karmin Murcelo) waits to provide them disguises, or through a vent to a hollow pushcart, manned by Jesus' brother Ramon (Henry Kingi). Once through, they put on their disguises and re-enter the grounds as customers.Skip is set to compete against reigning champion Caesar Geronimo (Joe Massengale) to swipe the prize: a bag of money (in reality the wardens' side bet) from the horns of a large, Brahman bull. Skip asks Caesar if he's tired of being his warden's stooge, suggesting that they give the money to the prisoners, even offering to help Caesar win if he chooses to do so. Both contestants play hard, but Caesar is the winner, grabbing the bag. Inspired by Skip's words, Caesar throws the bag over the fence to the inmates, much to the shock and outrage of wardens Beatty and Sampson. Skip prepares his own escape through the secret opening, but Graham shows up, suspicious. Grossberger knocks Graham out and Skip makes his escape into the waiting pushcart. He's herded off into the waiting camper, and the group drives off.Arriving at a secret meeting spot, Jesus and Rory quickly make introductions, then bid Harry and Skip farewell as they all pile into a waiting car, heading off to Mexico. Harry and Skip hop in the other waiting car, only to be stopped by another car containing Len Garber and Meredith. She tells Harry and Skip that, thanks to her work, the police have captured the real crooks, who have confessed to the bank robbery that wrongly convicted them. Harry and Skip, ecstatic, decide to resume their original plans of heading to Hollywood. Skip asks Meredith to go with him, and Meredith, on a whim, says ""yes""."

Drowning his sorrows after that botched mission during World War II, the traumatized ex-fighter pilot with a neurotic fear of flying, Ted Striker, still has not got over his old flame and flight attendant, Elaine Dickinson. Determined to win her back, Ted boards a domestic flight from Los Angeles to Chicago, only to come face-to-face with a severe case of in-flight food poisoning that is threatening everyone's lives. Now, with most of the passengers and the entire cockpit crew down with the food-borne illness, Striker has no other choice but to confront his inner demons and take over the control of the ungovernable aircraft with the help of a gruff air-traffic controller and his former commander. Can Ted Striker land the airplane and save the passengers?—Nick Riganas Ted Striker just got dumped by his long-time girlfriend Elaine Dickinson, who works as a stewardess at Trans American Airlines. In his wish to get her back, he follows her aboard the plane, although he has had a deep aversion against anything winged since he lost several men in the war. During flight, he tries to contact her again and again, but as the crew and many passengers get seriously ill due to a bad fish meal, he has no chance to get to her. In fact, Ted Striker seems to be the only healthy person aboard that has piloting experience. Now, it is up to him to get the bird down in Chicago safely, before the poisoning starts causing casualties. But Ted Striker's aversion really is a serious psychosis, which breaks open and needs to be cured - right now.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is a traumatized war veteran turned taxi driver. Because of his neurotic fear of flying and his drinking problem - he splashes beverages anywhere but into his mouth - Ted has been unable to hold down a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty), now a stewardess at Trans American Airlines, breaks off her relationship with him before her rostered flight from Los Angeles to Chicago. In order to regain her love, Ted overcomes his fear of flying, abandons his taxicab and buys a ticket on the same flight. However, once on board, Elaine continues to reject him, causing to drive several other passengers to suicide by accident as he reminisces with sorrow and regret.After the in-flight meal is served, many of the passengers fall sick, and Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) quickly discovers that the fish served during meal service gave the passengers food poisoning. The stewards discover that the entire flight crew, including Captain Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) and Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), have all come down with food poisoning, leaving no one aboard to fly the airplane. Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the airplane's autopilot, a large blow-up dummy named ""Otto"", which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the airplane. Elaine realizes that Striker is their only chance, and he is convinced to fly the airplane, though he still feels his trauma will prevent him from landing the airplane safely.After hearing Striker's name on the radio, McCroskey sends for Striker's former commander, Captain Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) - now serving as a commercial pilot - to help talk him down. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and land the plane safely, despite the landing gear shearing off, with only minor injuries to some passengers. Impressed by Striker's display of courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. The lovers watch as Otto takes control of the evacuated airplane and takes off after inflating a female companion."

When her husband dies on their wedding night, Judy decides to join the United States Army. She realizes that she has never been independent in her entire life. What looks like a bad decision at first, turns out not so bad at all. That is, until her superior officer makes sexual advances on her. She has been transferred to NATO headquarters in Europe and (re)meets the Frenchman Henri Tremont. Judy and Henri decide to marry, but will they?—Berend Meijer <bmeijer@euronet.nl> Twenty-eight year old Judy Benjamin, a stereotypical Jewish princess from Philadelphia, has the skills only for one thing in life, namely being married to a professional man which will allow them to hire a maid while she attends to serving her husband. As such, Judy has never been alone, always having had a boy/man in her life to do things for her. That life is more important than the choice of the husband in a romantic sense. People that know Judy, including her parents, have that similar view of and for her. All Judy's dreams come true with what will be her second marriage, this time to lawyer Yale Goodman. That dream bubble quickly pops when Yale dies of a heart attack on their wedding night. At a total loss of what to do with no man in her life, Judy is sold on the idea by a recruiter, Sgt. Jim Ballard, to join the army, Ballard marketing army life as something akin to a country club. Judy quickly finds that the six week basic training is nothing as Ballard mentioned, including that she cannot just quit because she doesn't like it. She is ill-equipped to basic training, which is made all the more difficult with the antagonism some of her fellow recruits have toward her. But what's probably worst is the mutual hatred between her and her squad leader, Captain Doreen Lewis, who wants to make Judy's life as miserable as possible just because of who she is. What skills Judy is able to pick up while in the army may not prepare her for everything army and life may throw at her, but those skills may prepare her for those things she finds important for herself, including in a relationship with French doctor Henrí Trémont, the first man she may truly believe is the entire package as a husband.—Huggo"

It is about October of 1947. Thirteen year old Loretta Webb and her younger brother Herman are riding on a mule and sled down to the mining camp in Van Lear, Kentucky to pick up the yearly gifts at the company store. Her father, Ted Webb, a hardworking coal miner, tells them they're ""giving the company their money back"". A young man in a soldier uniform newly discharged from the Army is placing bets on driving his jeep up a heap of coal slag. His name is Doolittle Lynn. He and Loretta exchange brief glimpses and flirts with each other. Doolittle wins the bet and gets his jeep to the top.Ted and his family arrive home with the gifts and we get a glimpse of mountain life with this poor, but decent and happy family of nine living in a log cabin in near abject poverty.

He and Loretta leave early, walk through the woods to her house, see a glimpse of the mine in town, and exchange their likeness for each other. Doolittle declares he wants to get out of the community and how the war changed him for the better on how he can live a more fulfilling life. Loretta doesn't seem to understand, with her very limited view of the world and probably never having been more than a few hours away from her home in her lifetime. Doolittle kisses her goodnight and says he will bring his jeep the next day to pick her upThe next day, Doolittle brings his jeep up to the Webb household and Loretta gets in and rides with him, without her mother's consent.

Loretta announces she's going to have a baby.Around April of 1948, Loretta and her father bid their farewells at the Van Lear train station with Ted declaring he'll see her again, but ""never see his little girl again"".It's about January 1959 (should be about 1956, due to the age of the kids) The Lynn family is living in a run-down, but comfortable home in rural Washington with her children Betty Sue, Jack Benny, Ernest Ray, and Cissy, all of them between 4 and 8 years old. Loretta is now a mature woman keeping house and competent cook, making up jars of apple butter and managing her kids. Doolittle is working as a logger. The family all sits down to dinner and they discuss their day.

She feels he is up to something and it turns out Doolittle wants her to audition to sing on stage the next Saturday. Loretta is scared half to death of doing such a thing, but Doolittle won't take no for an answer. The next Saturday, Loretta sings Patsy Cline's ""There He Goes"" and ends up loving what she did on stage and does another one.The Lynn family drives to a recording studio in Bellingham and Loretta records a song she's written called ""Honky Tonk Girl"". After a few flubs, she has now cut her first record.Doolittle takes a picture of Loretta in their home using a bedspread as a backdrop and an aluminum pot top as a flash. Then Doolittle stays up all night typing letters and sending copies of her records to recording studios.The next morning, on February 22, 1959, Loretta is cooking breakfast for her kids. She hears her name being called outside and thinks her father is approaching, but in actuality, it's her neighbor informing them of a family emergency. Her father has just died. The family drives all the way back to Kentucky for the wake at the family home. Doolittle and several other men are outside the cabin drinking moonshine and standing around a burning barrel.At her father's burial, Loretta declares to Doolittle she wants to be a singer. They begin their months long tour all over the south visiting the disk jockeys of the places Doolittle sent records to. The first station they visit is from a dj claiming he played her record and liked it, but she found it in the pile and reprimanded him for lying. After months on the road of sleeping in their car and subsisting on bologna sandwiches, crackers, and Cokes, they meet with record promoter, Hugh Cherry. Loretta says the word ""horny"" on the radio and did not know that was considered dirty and the manager declares he will never play another record of hers. However, Hugh finds out just now she is #14 on the country charts and it will be played.Loretta and Doolittle travel all night, pull over to the side of the road, and make out. The next morning, she wakes up with their car parked in front of the Grand Ole Opry and excited.Sometime in 1960, Loretta plays on The Grand Ole Opry for the first time. She is introduced by country singer Ernest Tubb (as himself). Country legends Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl are also on stage greeting her. She feels out of place and that she has not done enough to earn the spot, but does perform. Her husband Doolittle hangs out at a bar with a patron teasing him that he doesn't do or need to do anything and she'll be bringing home all the money now. Doolittle punches him. Loretta leaves that nightAbout September of 1961, Loretta is at the Ernest Tubb music shop singing Patsy Cline's ""I Fall to Pieces"" as a tribute to her. By this time, Loretta has spent the last year making repeated appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. She receives word from Patsy's husband, Charlie Dick, that Patsy wants to meet her. Patsy has been in the hospital recovering from a near fatal car accident. Loretta at first is intimidated by Patsy's outspoken and brassy personality, but the two become friends almost immediately.For the next several months or so, Loretta and Patsy make tours together on the Grand Ole Opry, at county fairs, and the like. Doolittle is becoming increasingly annoyed with Loretta's more independent nature, fast success, and influence from Patsy, especially trying on makeup for the first time. Loretta catches Doolittle drunk and making out with another woman in a car when their tour bus is about to leave.One day, Loretta and Patsy are out shopping in downtown Nashville, with Doolittle and Charlie dozing in the car while waiting. Doolittle has had enough and demands Loretta remove her makeup and she sasses him again. Doolittle slaps her for it and she breaks his fingers with her purse and they drive away.That night, Loretta is at their home suffering a migraine headache. Doolittle comes home and tells her he needs to get back out and work and do something he's good at, but Loretta assures him that it's because of him that she got where she's at. And he also declares to her there is a price to pay when you get there. Doolittle surprises Loretta with a wedding band she has for the first time after 14 years of marriage. Doolittle gets a job as an auto mechanic.In early March of 1963, Loretta announces to Patsy she's pregnant again and doesn't want to have the child (this was another timeline error, as the twin girls, Peggy and Patsy, were born August 6, 1964, almost a year and a half after Patsy's death). Patsy shows Loretta a box of maternity dresses and Loretta soon leaves. Patsy promises to call her first thing Monday morning after returning home from a benefit concert in Kansas City.On the morning of March 5, 1963, Loretta Lynn and Doolittle are in bed listening to Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"" and the disk jockey announces Patsy was killed in a plane crash earlier. Loretta breaks down with Doolittle comforting her and she feels she has nobody to talk to now.Loretta has her twin girls, Peggy and Patsy, but doesn't know which one is which.Over the next 5 years, Loretta is making endless concert tours throughout the country staying in her bus and nights in hotels. Also during this time, she and Doolittle have bought a ranch in Tennessee called Hurricane Mills with Doolittle as caretaker of ranch and raising the twin girls. At her last concert tour, a fan tries to rip her hair out. She is traveling on the bus that night exhausted, unable to sleep, and suffering a migraine.Loretta comes home sometime in 1969 for some rest and relaxation after months on the road. Doolittle points to a car their son Jack Benny wrecked (an error, it was a 1971 or 1972 Ford) She asks Doolittle to start accompanying her to her concerts to be her guardian and caretaker. He reluctantly agrees. Just as they are going to sleep, a phone call is made to their house from a lonely fan wanting to talk to Loretta and Doolittle says she is not home yet, but to quit crying and that he'll give Loretta the message.Loretta and Doolittle are touring together once again, but she's on the edge of burnout, due to her unable to memorize the words of Shel Silverstein's ""One's on the Way"". At another appearance, Loretta has woke up with her tour bus parked. She has not yet learned the words of the song. She pleads with Doolittle that she can't do the concert, but he feels she should just go out and perform. She comes onstage, but instead of singing, opens up her personal life on stage about how her concert appearances, fame, and all have been overwhelming and exhausting for her, but that she appreciates her fans caring about her. She collapses and has a nervous breakdown and Doolittle carries her out.Months pass by and Loretta spends her life resting away at the ranch. Doolittle takes Loretta out not too far from the ranch one morning and shows her a little house he wants to build. They have an argument about where the window should go and Loretta doesn't like the way he kept the house a secret from her. But they make upAfter about a year of recovery, and in 1970, Loretta is back on stage once again and sings her signature hit ""Coal Miner's Daughter"".Coal Miner's Daughter opens with Loretta Webb (Sissy Spacek) riding a mule to the coal mine to meet her Daddy when he completes his shift. As the opening credits continue, the film shows some coal miners deep in a Kentucky coal mine where one yells ""fire in the hole,"" which is followed by an explosion. Then the film switches to Doolittle Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones), who is dressed in his Army uniform, driving a jeep with a blonde girl sitting next to him. Doolittle talks to several of the miners in front of the company store bragging about his beat-up jeep. He cons them into betting he can't climb a heap of red dog (a hill of mining trash) in his jeep. Ted Webb (Levon Helm), Loretty, as he calls her, and Herman, a younger brother, enter the company store where Ted asks the storekeeper if his Sears Roebuck order has arrived. While the storekeeper fetches Ted's order, Doolittle coaxes his jeep up the trash heap and wins the bet. When the Webbs return home to their rundown cabin in Butcher Holler, we meet Loretta's mother, Clary (Phyllis Boyens), and the rest of the Webb brood: eight children who range in age from infancy to age thirteen.
Meanwhile Doolittle hikes up the mountain to see his moonshine making friend, Lee Dollarhide (William Sanderson). Doo, as Lee calls him, had worked for Lee selling moonshine to the miners before he went into the Army. Lee admits to the rumors that he steals from the moonshiners over at Greasy Creek when his own supply runs low. He offers to go fifty-fifty if Doo will help him with his moonshine business. Lee reminds his friend that men born in the mountains of eastern Kentucky have three choices: ""coal mine, moonshine or movin' on down the line."" Back at the Webb cabin, Daddy Webb presents the children with the shoes he had ordered from Sears Roebuck (in the summer they went barefooted, but in the winter they get shoes). On this occasion Loretta receives a dress in addition to shoes; she gets something extra, Ted explains, because she's gettin to be a woman. The first time in the film that Loretta sings she takes her youngest sibling out onto the porch and sings the traditional mountain song, ""In the Pines,"" a cappella. While she's out there, Lee starts another run on Greasy Creek and is shot by one of his moonshine competitors. Soon Doo and his Pa lead Lee's mule with his body draped over it past the Webb home. Doo's Pa is glad his son wasn't working for Lee or he would likely be draped over the mule beside his friend.
The scene changes to a community gathering where several of the youngsters are playing musical chairs while a string band plays. After the game there is a pie auction, for which Doo volunteers to be the auctioneer. When it comes time to auction Loretta's chocolate pie, Doo and another young man compete to be the highest bidder. Doo finally wins for $5. While the crowd square dances, Doo tries a bite of Loretta's pie and immediately spits it out. She had put salt instead of sugar in her pie by mistake. Later, he offers her a ride in his jeep, but she won't accept. So, he walks her home. During the walk Doo talks about how much he learned about the outside world while he was in the Army. It made him realize he doesn't want to be a coal miner. When they get to her cabin, he kisses her good night (it was her first kiss). As he's leaving he promises to bring his jeep up to her cabin and take her for a ride, but she doesn't think he can get it up the holler. The next morning, true to his word, Doo drives his jeep up the holler to take Loretta for a ride - a wild ride. When Doo almost plunges the jeep off an embankment, he kisses Loretta. She is breathless partly from the kiss, but also from the wild ride. Doo tells her, ""That's the way youre supposed to feel when youre in love."" When she returns home after dark, her Daddy whips her like she was a little girl and tells her to stay away from Doo. Later, when Loretta and her father go to a shallow mine for coal for the family to burn, he talks to her about her relationship with Doo; she's not even fourteen and he's a wild grown-up. He begs his ""shinin' pride"" not to throw her young years away, but she loves Doo and they want to get married. Back at the cabin while the family is listening to the Grand Ole Opry on their battery-powered radio, Ted encourages his wife, Clary, to do her squaw dance. Ted sings along with Bill Monroe's ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" while Clary dances. While everybody is watching and listening, Doo knocks on the door, but they don't hear him, so he comes in anyway. Once they realize he's in the cabin, Clary stops dancing and goes into another room and Ted turns off the radio and leaves the cabin. Once Loretta and Doo are alone, he shows her the money he had saved from his Army paychecks. He reminds her that the next day is their anniversary (he doesn't say anniversary of what), so he thinks it would be good time to get married. Loretta likes the idea, but tells him to ask her Daddy, who tells him to ask Clary, who tells him to ask Ted - back and forth. Finally, Doo waits until they are in bed and goes into their bedroom to ask them both at the same time. Ted asks him to promise two things: don't hit her and don't take her far away from home. Doo promises. The next day at their wedding there are two ladies sitting in the pews of the rustic church. Ted finally walks in the back door, stands there long enough to answer ""I do"" when the preacher asks who gives this woman to be married to this man, and then leaves. They don't have wedding rings to exchange. At the motel on their wedding night, it is freezing. Loretta puts her night gown on over her other clothes, partly because she's so cold but also because she's afraid of sex. Doo forces himself on her, which frightens and disgusts her. The next morning she won't go into the adjoining restaurant because she's sure people will stare and know what they've been doing. Doo tells her she better get used to it. When she says, ""I ain't gonna get used to you gettin' on me and sweatin' like an ol' pig,"" Doo breaks one of the promises he had made her Daddy; he slaps her. Doo goes to work at the coal mine while Loretta tries to learn how to be a house wife. Doo loses his patience with her lousy cooking, her lack of house cleaning and her innocence about how to love her man, so he gives her a book, ""Sex for Newlyweds."" In the following scene, Loretta trudges up the holler towards her folks' cabin; Doo has thrown her out. When her Daddy says, ""I believe married life's makin' you fat, girl,"" her mother immediately realizes her daughter is pregnant. Loretta goes to the doctor and sure enough, before her fourteenth birthday, she is pregnant. When she leaves the doctor's office, she sees a girl flirting with Doo so she picks up a stick and runs her off. Doo tells Loretta he's leaving Kentucky. He's going to Washington (state) to find a job; he refuses to be buried alive in the coal mine. He plans to send for her as soon as he saves enough money. She reminds him of his promise not to take her far away from home. Well, he says, she'll just have to choose which is more important: being her Daddy's daughter or his wife. He gives her a ride home and on the way she tells him she's going to have a baby. He laughs and says, ""You know, you might have found something that you know how to do."" Months later Loretta receives a letter from Doo with enough money for the trip to Washington. The film skips ahead to Loretta's life in Washington. She's now the seventeen-year-old mother of four. Doo, who is now known as ""Mooney"" because of his moonshine days back in Kentucky, works as a logger. One night Loretta sings the children to sleep with a song about the sinking of the Titanic. Mooney listens intently. Afterwards, he asks what she'd like for her anniversary present. She reminds him she still doesnt have a wedding ring. Mooney goes to the local pawn shop to look for an anniversary present. He comes home late that evening drunk with a guitar for her gift. Even though she can't play it, he bought her a guitar because he likes the way she sings. While she sits on the front porch washing clothes in a decrepit washing machine, she picks out the chords and sings ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?"" As she improves, she makes her kids sit and listen and also sings while Mooney washes the supper dishes.
Mooney suggests they get a babysitter and go honky-tonkin'. On Saturday night they go to the local Grange Hall. Mooney seems to have something on his mind and Loretta thinks he must be going to finally give her a ring. Instead, Mooney talks to the bandleader about auditioning Loretta to sing with his band. When she realizes what her husband is doing, she runs to the bathroom. He follows and finally talks her into the audition. The next week Loretta is introduced as the new girl singer of the Westerneers. At first, she sings ""There He Goes,"" a song popularized by Patsy Cline, very timidly, but quickly loses her inhibitions and performs the song so well that the audience applauds lustily. While she is gardening one day, she makes up her first original song, ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl."" Mooney wants Loretta to cut a record, so they go to a small local recording studio. After she flubs a take, Mooney places the kids in the studio so she can sing to them like she does at home. After a few bars, the recording engineer stops the session to get more and better pickers because ""that little lady sings her hind end off."" Back home, Mooney takes a publicity photo with their bedspread as the backdrop. After work, he stays up all night addressing envelopes with Loretta's photo and her record to country DJs. Mooney and Loretta don't have a telephone, so a neighbor comes to tell Loretta she has a long distance emergency phone call - her Daddy has died. Back in Kentucky for the funeral, friends and family sing ""Amazing Grace"" at the wake. It took Loretta quite a while to recover from her Daddy's death. Mooney finally convinces her if she wants to be a singer they have to see DJs in person to make certain they play her record. Grandma keeps the kids while they travel from station to station in eastern Kentucky. One of them claims to have received her record, played it and it flopped, but they find the envelope they sent unopened. She rants so vociferously, the DJ relents and plays it. On an interview segment a DJ tells her she has to pay her dues before she can sing on the Opry. Despite all the obstacles, ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl"" becomes a hit. After an all-night drive, Loretta wakes to find they're parked in front of the Ryman Auditorium, the home of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She's in awe. On her first appearance on the Opry, Ernest Tubb (himself) opens the show by singing ""Walkin' the Floor Over You."" Loretta is scared; she doesn't think she belongs on such a prestigious stage; she hasn't suffered enough to be this far this fast. (The film shows a glimpse of two country music legends, Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff, in the wings of the theater.) Tubb introduces Loretta who sings ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl."" After her performance, Tubb invites her to return the following week. After Loretta appeared on the Opry seventeen straight weeks, she sings ""I Fall to Pieces"" at Ernest Tubb's Record Shop in downtown Nashville. During an instrumental break, she dedicates the song to Patsy Cline, who made it a hit. She tells the listening audience that Patsy is in the hospital recovering from a car wreck. Afterward, Charlie Dick (Bob Hannah), Patsy's husband, meets them outside and tells Loretta that Patsy (Beverly DAngelo) would like to meet her. Loretta accompanies Charlie to the hospital and she and Patsy become bosom buddies. When Patsy returns to the Opry, she sings ""Sweet Dreams"" while Loretta watches from the wings. Later on Patsy's tour bus on the way to an appearance at a fair, Patsy sings a little of Kitty Wells' hit ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels."" In the pouring rain, Patsy and Loretta sing a duet of ""Back in Baby's Arms"" while each holds an umbrella. After the show Loretta catches Mooney in the back seat of a car with a carnival floozie. She drags him out and threatens that she better never catch him with trash like that again. Later, on the bus she writes the song ""You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)"" about that incident. After a shopping trip with Patsy, Mooney and Loretta fight over her use of makeup (he doesn't like it and never has). Loretta hits his hand with her purse and then drives away with Charlie and Patsy. When Mooney comes home late, his hand is all bandaged. He's decided to get a job (he feels like a kept man and that was a serious male ego problem in the country community if not in the nation at large). She offers to quit if her being the bread winner is going to cause them to split. During their conversation, he finally gives her a wedding ring. Mooney gets a job as a mechanic in a garage where we hear Loretta sing ""You Ain't Woman Enough"" over the radio. Loretta visits Patsy and tells her she's pregnant again, but she doesn't want this baby. Patsy cheers her up by promising to give her the biggest baby shower in Nashville. Then Patsy gives her a box of her old maternity clothes. Patsy is leaving for a benefit performance in Kansas City, but she promises to call when she returns on Monday and they'll go shopping. Loretta wakes on Monday morning to the sounds of Patsy's voice singing ""Sweet Dreams"" on the radio. The announcer speaks over her singing and says, ""You're listening to a tribute to the late Patsy Cline, tragically killed early this morning in a plane crash near Dyersburg, Tennessee."" In the next scene, Loretta has given birth to twin girls that she names Peggy and Patsy (of course, Patsy is named after Patsy Cline). Back on stage at the Opry, Loretta sings ""You're Lookin' at Country."" As the song continues, she tours, writes songs on her tour bus, and signs autographs. The Opry announcer introduces her as having twenty-one No. 1 records. While she sings ""Sweet Dreams,"" Mooney drives his jeep up to their mansion in Hurricane Hills, Tennessee and later bathes the twins. While she sings ""You Ain't Woman Enough"" we see her touring again and spending lonely nights in hotel rooms. When the Opry announcer introduces her as the first lady of country music, she sings ""Your Squaw Is on the Warpath,"" while Mooney and the twins watch on TV. Her relentless schedule finally catches up with her. She's having throbbing headaches and medicine doesn't help. She wants Mooney on the road with her to take care of her. Out on the road again, Loretta sings ""Lovin' Country Style."" Later, she can't remember the lyrics to a new song, ""One's on the Way,"" so one of her band members feeds the lyrics to her, but they soon give up and switch to the more familiar ""You Ain't Woman Enough."" At her next concert, she doesn't want to go on, but Doo convinces her not to let her fans down. When she goes on stage, she doesn't come in after the band plays the introduction for her first song. Instead, she talks to the audience - her friends and fans and tells them that Patsy told her, ""you got to run your own life,"" but she feels like her life is running her. As she walks off the stage she collapses into her husband's arms (she suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by physical exhaustion and marital stress - her marriage miraculously survived).
After her recuperation back at their ranch, she returns to the Opry and sings ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" which is her very autobiographical song. That song segues into the closing credits which recaps scenes from the film. Further into the closing credits, we hear excerpts from ""One's on the Way,"" ""I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,"" ""You Ain't Woman Enough,"" ""You're Lookin' at Country,"" ""Fist City,"" ""Your Squaw Is On the Warpath,"" and ""Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)."""
Smokey and the Bandit II,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081529/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Bandit goes on another cross-country run, transporting an elephant from Florida to Texas. And, once again, Sheriff Buford T. Justice is on his tail. It's been a few years since Cletus and the Bandit made their famous 28-hour run to Texas for a few cases of Coors. Bandit is now a washed-up has-been living in the past, until Big Enos and Little Enos make him another offer: Transport a live Elephant across country in 3 days or less.—Afterburner <aburner@erols.com> Big Enos Burdett (Pat McCormick) is attempting to be elected as Governor of Texas against other candidate, John Coen (David Huddleson). After a figurative and literal ""mudslinging"" between the two, they are both confronted by the outgoing governor, and given a thorough tongue lashing. As Burdett is leaving the office he overhears the governor yelling at an assistant to take responsibility of transporting a crate of unknown content from Miami to the Republican Party convention in Dallas. Burdett then schemes to pick up the crate and deliver it to the convention. He enlists the help of Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus (Jerry Reed) to carry out the task.The early parts of the film feature Cledus attempting to convince the Bandit to ""do it one last time."" Unfortunately, in the time since their previous challenge in the original 'Smokey and the Bandit' film, the Bandit has split from his love-interest ""Frog"" (Sally Field) and become an alcoholic. The Bandit is said to be ""the only man in the world to drink up a Trans Am,"". Cledus seeks the help of Frog to encourage the Bandit to sober up and regain his fitness, since Big Enos has raised the stakes of the game to $400,000. Frog abandons her second attempt at wedding Buford T. Justice's son Junior (Mike Henry) to help. She is initially persuaded more by the money than her love for Bandit. She buys him a 1980 Turbo Trans Am ""Son of Trigger""... powered by the Turbo 301, by trading in Junior's car.The middle sections of the film feature a madcap race across the United States as the trio once again tries to outrun and outwit Sheriff Justice (Jackie Gleason) and Junior. The team discovers that their cargo is in quarantine for three weeks, and they need to get it to Dallas in three days. When they break into the quarantine area to steal the crate, the mysterious cargo turns out to be an elephant (the mascot of the Republican Party) who they named Charlotte after Snowman remarked that she reminded him of his Aunt Charlotte and even smelled like her, too. When Cledus opens the crate containing the elephant, Charlotte races out, nearly trampling Frog. The Bandit saves the day by doing a backflip onto the elephant's back and riding the elephant out of the quarantine shed. Noticing a splinter was stuck in her foot, the Bandit removes it, and the elephant takes a shine to Bandit. On their way to Dallas, Cledus fears Charlotte is in poor health. They find an Italian doctor, played by Dom DeLuise, in the back of an ambulance stopped at the same gas station as they are. When the doctor, a gynecologist by trade, finds out it is an elephant he has to look at, he freaks out and nearly runs away. As the doctor attempts to refuse helping them, he sees his driver speed away in the ambulance, leaving him stranded. After the Bandit and Cledus bribe him with large amounts of money he gives in and agrees to ride in the truck with the elephant and examine her. Charlotte is later discovered to be pregnant, and eventually gives birth later in the film.As they try to make the Burdett's deadline, the doctor pleads with the Bandit for some time off the road so Charlotte can rest off of her feet. He reluctantly gives in twice, the first time wrapped up by Charlotte, the second time agrees on his own, Frog citing Bandit's desire to regain his lost fame of the past. She grows closer to him as she did in the past film. While at a restaurant, she sees him scribbling on a napkin a picture of Charlotte cradled by suspended netting in order to keep her off of her feet. She becomes furious and leaves. The Bandit follows and she says he does not care about the elephant and when he likes himself again would she then consider seeing him again.He later makes his drawing a reality, in a near drunken stupor. The doctor agrees the idea will work and agrees to press on. Unable to stop the Bandit and Cledus, Justice enlists the help of his two brothers, Reginald Van Justice from Canada, and Gaylord Justice (both also played by Jackie Gleason), from another part of Texas. Justice lures the Bandit into a valley, with a line of Mounties on one hill side, Texas Rangers on the other. Bandit orders Cledus to continue delivering Charlotte to Dallas. Cledus later returns, with a convoy of trucks to help destroy all of the police cars. Charlotte and the doctor watch the action from afar. After the mass destruction of police cars, only Buford, Gaylord, and Reginald come out relatively unscathed. Bandit and Cledus escape the valley by driving across a bridge of tractor trailers. As the Justice's follow, a trailer pulls out resulting in their cars falling down and being destroyed. However, Buford's car is still operable, though folded up in the middle and missing its doors and roof. Justice and Junior are cut off by a farm tractor, and they drive off the road, hitting an embankment by a pond, throwing Junior into the pond. When asked what he was thinking about, Buford simply says, ""Retiring.""The movie closes with Bandit informing Frog he liked himself again, that he didn't want to spend the rest of his life without her. When she asks about Burdett's bet, he informs her he blew it, and said they could still get there nonetheless, late though. He shows her Charlotte and her baby in circus-like chariots. Frog is overjoyed. Bandit asks Charlotte if it is OK to marry Frog, to which Charlotte responds loudly. They drive away with Charlotte and her baby in tow... and Buford still pursuing them in a bus."
The Blue Lagoon,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080453/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the Victorian period, two children are shipwrecked on a tropical island in the South Pacific. With no adults to guide them, the two make a simple life together, unaware that sexual maturity will eventually intervene. On a journey to San Francisco, Richard, his father and cousin Emmeline find themselves on a ship about to explode. Rushed to a lifeboat with Paddy Button, the two children escape while their father (and uncle) are on another lifeboat. In the chaos following, the lifeboats are separated. Paddy, Richard and Emmeline find themselves with no food and no water stuck in the middle of nowhere. After some time, the three come across an uncharted island, where Paddy quickly teaches the children fishing, hunting and building. After maybe a month or two, Paddy gets very drunk off a barrel of rum found on the island when they first arrive, and drowns in the middle of the night. Now alone and very scared, Richard and Emmeline move location and rebuild their island home. Years later, the children grow into teenagers and have developed a very real home on their island paradise. But hormones and feelings between the two strain their friendship, until Richard, who is still very determined to reach San Francisco, is unhappy with Emmeline when a ship passes by the island and she does not light the signal fire. Throwing her out of the home they had built together, Emmeline attempts to survive on her own but is hurt after stepping on a stonefish. After Richard finds her deathly sick, he realizes how he really feels for her and manages to save her from certain doom. Nature runs its course, and their friendship turns into love as the couple learn about the facts of life, when Emmeline has a baby and does not know the reason. Then for the first time in years, a ship led by Richard's father shows up on the horizon and sees the couple playing with their baby ashore.—Bree Pearson Two young children are the sole survivors of a shipwreck in a time when sailing was the only way of travel. They are stranded on a tropical island, a real paradise. Together, Richard and Emmeline have to survive, which is quite easy as there are no dangerous animals on the island. Years later, the two teenagers are living in a self-constructed hut, strange emotions start influencing their relationship. Although they had no grown-ups to educate them for all that time, the behaviour of the two always stayed in a very civilized way. Nature takes its course, and Emmeline gets pregnant, totally unaware of the fact that a child is growing inside her. On the night their boy is born, Richard finds out about the origins of the drums they hear from time to time from the forbidden side of the island.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> It is the Victorian era in the South Pacific. Two young children, cousins Richard and Emmeline Lestrange are sailing with Richard's father, Arthur, to San Francisco. When the ship suddenly catches fire, the ship's cook, Paddy Button, gathers the children in a lifeboat and rows away from the wreck. However they are separated from the children's father, who has escaped on a separate dinghy, and drift out to sea. They arrive on the shores of a lush, tropical island. Paddy assumes responsibility for the children and, over an indeterminable amount of time, teaches them how to find food and build shelter, though he can't deter them from taking their shirts off and running about half naked.One day he discovers a stone altar covered in blood and the remains of what appear to be a human sacrifice. He warns the children to stay away from that place, telling them it's 'the law' and that the boogeyman lives there. He also tells them to never eat a certain scarlet berry that Emmeline finds, presumably to keep them from eating anything uncertain. He calls them 'never-wake-up berries'.One day, Paddy discovers a barrel of rum or whiskey washed ashore from the sunken ship. The children wake up in the morning and take the rowboat out to where they see Paddy lying in the sand. Thinking he's merely asleep, they flip him over to see that he's died in a drunken binge. Emmeline begs him to take her away. They pack up everything they have and row around to the other side of the island where they find a new stretch of beach to settle on.Richard and Emmeline mature into strong teenagers (Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields), spending their days diving for pearls and fish, gathering food, or maintaining their tree house.Richard and Emmeline soon start developing both physically and emotionally in ways they can't explain. Growing up as children, they are generally ignorant to the changes. Emmeline experiences her first menstrual period while swimming and calls out to Richard, afraid at first. When he arrives and asks what's wrong, she yells at him, embarrassed, and tells him to go away. Richard finds himself becoming physically attracted to Emmeline but she, though often fearful of being left alone, doesn't reciprocate. One day, ever-curious Emmeline wanders to the forbidden side of the island and finds a Moai-like stone idol there with the tell-tale stain of blood. Thinking instead that the place is holy, she prays and later tells Richard that she thinks Paddy was wrong and that the 'boogeyman', who bleeds like Jesus, is actually God.They speak often of being rescued and going to 'San Frisco' to see Richard's father, but when a ship passes by the island for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire they had set up. Richard emerges from foraging in time to see the ship depart and angrily confronts Emmeline. She tells him that the island is their home now and that they should stay, to Richard's disbelief. They insult each other and Emmeline reveals that she knows what happens when Richard goes off alone which leads him to throw a coconut at her. She throws one back, hitting him on the head.After building a makeshift hut for herself near the water, Emmeline steps on a stone-fish. Richard discovers her deathly ill in her hut and she begs him to take her to God, despite the law. Fearing for her life, Richard does so and places her on the stone altar, reciting what little he remembers of his prayers. Emmeline eventually recovers and, after she regains her ability to walk, goes swimming with Richard in the lagoon. Afterwards, they sit naked together and share some fruit as well as their first kiss. They lie down with each other, expressing their love for each other, and discover sexual intercourse and passionate love. Putting all their past arguing aside, they spend most of every waking moment with each other, playing in the water or making love. However, Emmeline soon becomes pregnant. Though this is clear to the viewer through Emmeline's hunger cravings and her ability to feel the baby, she and Richard are unsure of her physical changes and have no knowledge of childbirth, attributing it all, at first, to Emmeline merely getting fatter.One night, Emmeline goes missing and Richard looks through the jungle for her. Following the sound of drums, he comes upon the altar where 'God' stood. There, he witnesses a native tribe performing a human sacrifice. Richard flees as the victim is killed and hears Emmeline's cries, following them in time to help her give birth to a baby boy whom they name Paddy.They bring the baby back to their home and try to feed him. Frustrated by the baby's crying and that he won't take solid foods or juice, Emmeline takes him in her arms to see that he instinctively suckles at her breast. Richard tells Emmeline what he witnessed the night she gave birth and assures her that if any of the natives come to find them he will stick them with his spear like a fish. But the natives never come to their side of the island. As the baby grows, they teach him how to swim and play. As they all play together in wet mud near the shore, a ship led by Richard's father approaches the island and sees them there. As they are completely covered in mud, Arthur does not recognize them. Paddy points to the ship but when Richard and Emmeline see it, they resign all previous intentions of leaving the island with silent glances and retreat with Paddy into the forest.Richard is seen taking the rowboat alone out to the small island where Paddy Button died. He approaches the beach and sees the old man's skeleton lying in the sand, bleached white from the sun. Richard tentatively touches his ribs, matching them to Paddy's, and looks at the bones in his hands. A morbid understanding comes to him and it's implied that he has a better grasp on his own body as well as death.One morning, the young family takes the rowboat to visit their original home site and to collect food and other supplies. Richard goes to harvest bananas while Emmeline and the baby explore near shore and Emmeline fails to notice young Paddy collecting scarlet berries and putting them in his pocket. The two of them go back to the boat to wait for Richard but the tide takes them out when Emmeline falls asleep. She is awakened by the sound of Paddy pushing one of the oars into the water and tries to fetch it with the other. When she can't, she calls out to Richard who starts to swim to the boat, followed closely by a shark. Just before he reaches the boat, Emmeline throws the last oar at the shark, hitting it and giving Richard enough time to get out of the water.

They learn the Archdiocese will stop supporting the school and will sell the place to the Education Authority.

Are the Blues Brothers destined for glory?—Nick Riganas The film opens with several aerial shots of the factories and oil refineries around Chicago at night as the images pan overhead to a prison.We next see a prisoner being roused and escorted by two guards through Joliet Prison in Illinois. Is he on his way to the gallows? No, he's up for ""standard parole"". His personal items are returned to him, including a broken watch and prophylactics. The prisoner is released -- it is Jake (John Belushi). He meets his brother Elwood (Dan Akroyd) outside the prison gate. These are the Blues Brothers. Elwood has shown up in a used Plymouth police car after having traded in their old Cadillac for a microphone. Demonstrating the power of the car, with its cop tires, cop suspension, and 440 cubic-inch power plant, Elwood convinces Jake that this is the new Bluesmobile.They go see the ""Penguin"", Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), the head nun at the Catholic orphanage they grew up in in downtown Chicago. She explains that they need $5,000 to pay property taxes, or else the orphanage will be closed by the local Archbishop. Aghast at Jake and Elwood's casual swearing, she beats them with a yardstick and throws them out of her office saying she'll pray for their souls and not to return until they've ""redeemed"" themselves.Jake and Elwood meet up with their old friend and father figure Curtis (Cab Calloway), a handyman who operates the orphanage who advises them to ""get yourself to church"". They go to a Baptist church, where Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown) delivers an uplifting sermon. Jake ""sees the light"" realizing that he must put the Blues Brothers Band back together in order to raise the $5,000. Now they are on a mission from God.That evening during a drive about how to get their old band back together, Elwood runs a red light and the Bluesmobile gets pulled over by a local state trooper police car. The two State Troopers Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Mount (Steven Williams) ask for Elwood's driver's license and registration. Through SCMODS (State County Municipal Offender Database System), the officers learn that Elwood has numerous outstanding traffic tickets and moving violations. The police intend to impound the car, but Elwood takes off, leading to a car chase. Another State trooper car driven by Trooper La Fong (director John Landis) and a ""charming Trooper"" (Stephen Bishop) joins in on the chase. The Blues Brothers get away (destroying a shopping mall in the process by driving through it), but now the Illinois authorities are searching for them. Both Troopers Daniel and Mount vow to catch or kill the Blues Brothers.Jake and Elwood park their car in a run-down part of the Loop of downtown Chicago where they walk to a fleabag hotel where Elwood is staying. A mystery woman (Carrie Fisher) attempts to kill Jake by firing a rocket launcher at him, but the Blues Brothers duck and the rockets miss. The woman drives away in a red Cadillac. Unfazed, Jake and Elwood enter the hotel (populated by homeless transients). Elwood asks the manager Floyd if there were any phone calls. The manager says no calls but a man named Burton Mercer (John Candy), a local corrections and parole officer, visited looking for Elwood. Jake and Elwood then go to Elwood's small room that sits right near the local L-train line where Jake falls asleep in Elwood's bed.The next morning, the mystery woman arrives at the fleabag hotel just as Troopers Daniel and Mount show up along with Burton Mercer who ID's the correct home address of Elwood. The unknown woman then blows up the entire hotel building with a bomb, but Jake and Elwood walk away from the rubble (as do the cops who were just about to apprehend them).Trying to find their old band members, who have since taken other jobs, they visit a boarding house where one of the members had previously stayed. The landlady doesn't remember where he went, but at the last minute she finds a business card with ""Murph and the Magic Tones"" on it.That evening, Jake and Elwood find Murph and the Magic Tones playing at a Holiday Inn Hotel lounge whom makes up of keyboardist/lead vocalist Murphy Dunne, guitarist Steve Cropper, guitarist Donald 'Duck' Dunn, drummer Willy Hall, and sax player Tom Malone.

The brothers behave offensively while eating a meal, tossing food and offering to buy women. Promising that they'll be back to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day at this restaurant until he joins them, Mr. Fabulous reluctantly agrees.The next day, while tooling around in the Bluesmobile, the guys get stuck in a traffic jam. Some Neo-Nazis are protesting on a stone bridge. Proclaiming ""I hate Illinois Nazis"", Elwood uses the Bluesmobile to force the Nazis to jump off the bridge. The humiliated lead Nazi (Henry Gibson) vows to find those guys and brutally kill them... further adding to the Blues Brothers ever growing list of enemies.Jake and Elwood arrive in a seedy area of Maxwell Street where they park their car and see John Lee Hooker as he plays outside a soul food restaurant. Inside the restaurant, the brothers meet Matt 'Guitar' Murphy, as well as 'Blue Lou' Marini to ask them to rejoin their band. Matt's wife (Aretha Franklin) sings ""Think"", warning Matt to think about it before leaving the restaurant they own. Matt and Lou quit, and the band is complete.Meanwhile, the mystery woman that is hounding Jake and Elwood is revealed to work and own a local beauty salon. After the salon closes for the night, she reads up in a book on how to operate a flame thrower.The next morning, the band's first stop is Ray's Music Exchange in Calumet City. The proprietor Ray (Ray Charles) shows off the action in a keyboard, singing ""Shake A Tail Feather"". The band buys $1,400 worth of instruments, on an I.O.U.While driving aimlessly that evening, the Blues Brother's first gig is at Bob's Country Bunker, where the Good Old Boys are scheduled to play. Passing themselves off as the Good Old Boys, the Blues Brothers manage to play both types of music (Country and Western). They earn $200, but drink $300 worth of beer. They skip out on paying. Now Jake and Elwood have yet another set of enemies, that of the bar owner Bob (Jeff Morris) and Tucker McElroy (Charles Napier) the lead singer of the late-arriving Good Old Boys. They get away when the pursuing truck is T-boned by State Troopers Daniel and Mount who have spotted the Bluesmobile. Daniel and Mount place Bob, Tucker, and the Good Old Boys under arrest for speeding and damaging their police car as Mount deadpans, ""boys, you are in big trouble"".In a sauna the next day, Jake and Elwood have a business meeting with promoter Maury Sline (Steve Lawrence) who agrees to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom for them tomorrow night.The word goes out on the streets -- Jake and Elwood swipe an enormous air-raid siren, strap it to the roof of the Bluesmobile, and use it as a loudspeaker to make announcements throughout the city about the upcoming concert. They run out of gas. The local gas station is also out of gas. Elwood flirts with a chic lady (Twiggy) while waiting for the tanker truck to arrive.The Blues Brothers Band play their concert at the Palace Hotel, beginning with Curtis as an opening act sings ""Minnie The Moocher"" as they wait for Jake and Elwood to arrive. Having heard about the concert, the authorities lead by Jake's parole officer, Burton Mercer, along with Troopers Daniel and Mount, stake out the joint, planning to apprehend them after the show. Bob, Tucker and the Good Old Boys, having just made bail, also see the advertisement and show up at the concert vowing to kill both Jake and Elwood.Jake and Elwood sneak past the cops and join the band. The crowd is unmoved at first but are soon cheering. The band plays so well that backstage a producer for a major record company offers them $10,000 cash as an advance on their first recording session. Jake and Elwood accept the offer and keep $5,000, asking the producer to send $1,400 to Ray's Music Exchange and to give the rest to the band. The brothers take off through a trap door in the stage while the band continues vamping.The mystery woman confronts them in an underground tunnel, firing an automatic M-16 rifle at them. It is revealed here that the mystery woman is Jake's former fiancee whom he abandoned at her wedding several years ago and she wants to personally kill Jake for her humiliation. Pleading for his life, Jake removes his sunglasses for the first (and only) time in the film. She melts, smiles ""oh, Jake"", and kisses him. He pushes her to the ground, saying ""let's go"".The police begin realizing the brothers are making their escape. Jake and Elwood are in the Bluesmobile with 106 miles to get to Chicago, a full tank of gas, a half pack of cigarettes, at night, and they're wearing sunglasses. An epic and climatic car chase begins as the Blues Brothers head towards Chicago to pay the taxes. Bob, Tucker and the Good Old Boys join in on the chase, but Elwood had earlier sabotaged their trailer by spraying super glue to the gas/accelerator peddle which causes Tucker to loose control of the trailer and crashes it into a nearby pond.In the morning, numerous police cars tumble off an embankment, and one (driven by Troopers Daniel, Mount and Burton) ends up in a truck. As they approach the city, all city police authorities are alerted and ""the use of excessive force is approved"" in their apprehension. The chase continues in Chicago, reaching speeds of 110 mph on Lower Wacker Drive. Dozens of police cars continue to pile up. Hearing chatter on the police radios, the Nazis spot the Bluesmobile and give chase. The Bluesmobile stops at the edge of a highway overpass under construction, but the car with the lead Nazi tumble over the edge. Jake and Elwood arrive at Daley Plaza just in time, as their car literally falls apart.The police buildup continues absurdly, with National Guard units, helicopters, and SWAT teams getting involved. Jake and Elwood hastily make their way to the Cook County Assessor's Office, barring doors and sabotaging an elevator on the way. Hundreds of troops are in pursuit. In the assessor's office they grab the clerk (a cameo by Steven Spielberg) and give him the money to pay the taxes. The moment the tax receipt is handed to them they are handcuffed, surrounded by countless troops with pointed firearms.The film closes with the Blues Brothers and their Band playing their next concert in prison, beginning with ""Jailhouse Rock""."

But things in the Jarrett household are not all right. Although stating he is unsure why he decides to do so, Conrad restarts his psychiatric therapy outside of the hospital with a Dr. Berger.

Will the psychiatrist succeed in helping Conrad?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On the surface this film tells the disintegration of an upper-middle class family in Lake Forest, Illinois, following the death of the older son in a boating accident. In fact, in depth, it tells of the profound perverse narcissism of the mother, Beth, who seeks success only in the social norm of appearances and their approval by hiding behind her mother status, and who, by being blind to the psychology and feelings of her family, has installed coldness of heart, superficiality of feelings and absence of empathy as the standard way of life, in her home. As she refuses to question herself and respond to the need for love around her, finally her husband Calvin will ask her to leave. The story is mainly told through the younger son, Conrad, who suffers badly from the consequences of his mother's attitude and atmosphere in the family, by responding with guilt, depression and a suicide attempt, because, as a teenager, he does not have yet the tools to decipher this artificial superficiality and make the connections, until he is helped by a committed Dr Berger and finds his way out with his father."

Then, Mr Hallorann, the facility's ageing chef, chats with Danny about rare psychic gifts. The mysterious employee also warns the boy about the cavernous hotel's abandoned rooms. Room 237, especially, is off-limits. That's all very well, but Jack is gradually losing his mind. After all, strange occurrences and blood-chilling visions have trapped the family in a silent gargantuan prison hammered by endless snowstorms. And now, incessant voices inside Jack's head demand sacrifice. However, is Jack capable of murder?—Nick Riganas Built in 1907, the posh, grand and secluded Overlook Hotel, located in the mountains of Colorado, closes for the winter months as it was never designed as a ski resort, that seclusion and isolation which has always been its attraction for its upscale guests and which makes it largely inaccessible in the snowy winter. Having recently moved from Vermont to Boulder with his wife Wendy and their adolescent son Danny, former schoolteacher Jack Torrance has just accepted the five month job as the Overlook's winter caretaker in wanting uninterrupted solitude to start his new career as a writer. In accepting the job, Jack was not deterred in knowing of the incident ten years ago when the then hotel GM Charles Grady, acting as that season's winter caretaker, developed a severe case of cabin fever and ended up gruesomely killing his wife and two daughters before killing himself. Beyond a recent undiagnosed collapse experienced by Danny which may be an issue if it happens again at the hotel, Wendy is looking forward to this five month getaway. While Danny indirectly states he doesn't want to go, Wendy is not concerned about his emotional well being in this new situation as he, out of circumstance, has often been on his own without other children around, which has long ago led to him creating an imaginary friend named Tony who lives in Danny's mouth. When the Torrances arrive at the Overlook on October 30th, its last day of operation before they take over for the winter, Danny learns that there is someone at the hotel who knows his secret abilities in association to Tony's true nature. After the regular staff leaves for the winter and as winter truly sets in, the isolation of the resort begins to show itself. The question becomes which of the often battling powers in this isolation will ultimately come out on top: Wendy's mortal fortitude, Danny's secret ability which he learns is called the shining, or the hotel's associated secrets which are slowly overtaking Jack.—Huggo A novelist - Jack Torrance takes a job interview as winter caretaker of the isolated, old, huge and beautiful Overlook Hotel. Jack brings his wife - Wendy and his son Danny. It happens that Danny, has a mysterious power known as ""The Shining"". Danny meets Hallorann - the hotel cook in their first day arriving at the Overlook, who warns him about the hotel and the sinister Room 237. As the days go by, Danny has visions, meanwhile Jack starts driving into insanity, turning more and more aggressive, at the point that Danny and Wendy gets convinced that Jack might try to do something bad.—Film Geek Guy Former teacher and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) interviews for a caretaker job at the Overlook Hotel in an effort to rebuild his life after his volatile temper lost him his teaching position. The hotel manager, Mr. Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson), warns Jack that he and his family will be snowbound through most of the winter and of the potential risk for cabin fever. He drives the point home by recounting a season when the caretaker, Charles Grady, went crazy and brutaly killed his wife, his two girls (Lisa BurnsandLouise Burns), and finally himself. Given his own desperation and the opportunity to pursue his true passion, writing, Jack acknowledges the warning, but accepts the job.Meanwhile, Jack's son Danny (Danny Lloyd) has a seizure while talking to his imaginary friend Tony about the Overlook Hotel. He has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel, an image which is revisited several times throughout the film.Upon Danny's arrival at the hotel, head chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) recognizes that Danny is telepathic, and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. He explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as ""shining."" He also counsels Danny about the hotel, hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace, ""as if someone burned toast,"" which only people who can ""shine"" will perceive. Danny questions Dick about what went on in the hotel, and about Room 237 in particular as Danny can sense that Dick is especially afraid of that room. Though he strives to assure Danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just ""like pictures in a book"" and can't hurt him, Dick sternly warns Danny to stay out of that room.Jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. He has writer's block, sleeps too little, and is irritable. Danny has visions of the two murdered Grady girls, but tells no one. He continues to wonder about Room 237.While the weather is still relatively warm, Jack's wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and Danny walk through a maze of tall hedges, making a game out of it, stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes.One day, a ball rolls toward Danny as he plays with his toys. It appears to have come from the open door of Room 237, which Danny enters. At that moment, Wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of Jack's screams in the lounge. He tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop Danny and her to pieces. As a disconcerted Wendy promises that ""Everything's gonna be okay,"" Danny appears at the other end of the room, looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. His sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. He does not answer when Wendy asks what happened. She angrily accuses Jack of hurting Danny and takes the child back to their suite.Jack is furious about the accusation. He storms around the hotel, making his way to the Gold Ballroom. Sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar, his head in his hands, Jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. When he looks up he discovers a bartender (Joe Turkel), who serves him a drink. Jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name, Lloyd. In the course of telling his troubles to Lloyd, Jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated Danny's shoulder, the same accident Wendy mentioned to Danny's pediatrician earlier. Notably, Jack states that the injury happened three years ago, while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician, Wendy said that Jack, who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident, has currently been sober for only five months.A frantic Wendy enters, finding Jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate Danny's claim that ""a crazy woman"" attacked him in the bathtub of Room 237. Jack, who acts a bit tipsy, grudgingly agrees to go have a look.As Jack approaches the door to Room 237, Danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. Dick, back at his home in Florida, stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal Danny is sending.Jack cautiously enters Room 237. The bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. He watches lustfully as a young, beautiful, naked woman (Lia Beldam) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. The two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. Jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. He recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman (Billie Gibson); a walking corpse with rotten, sagging skin. She cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. Stunned, Jack staggers out of the room, locking the door after him.When he reports back to Wendy, Jack denies anything amiss in Room 237. Wendy suggests they take Danny to a doctor. Jack becomes irate, lecturing Wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. Insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers, he storms out, returning to the Gold Room, which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. Lloyd serves him a drink and Jack strolls through the crowd. He doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him, spilling advocaat on his jacket. The butler convinces Jack to come into the bathroom to clean up.The butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady (Philip Stone). Jack remembers the story Mr. Ullman told him about a former caretaker named Grady murdering his family and confronts Grady with the information. Grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that Jack has ""always been the caretaker."" Jack is confused, but seems to accept Grady's story. Grady goes on to tell Jack that Danny has ""a great talent"" and is using it to bring an ""outside party"" into the situation, referring to Dick Halloran with a racial slur. Grady advises Jack on how to ""correct"" Danny, and how to deal with Wendy if she interferes.Back in Florida, Dick has had no luck contacting the people at the Overlook Hotel. Worried about Danny, he books the next flight to Colorado.At the Overlook, Wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for Jack, intent on leaving the hotel with Danny whether or not Jack agrees to come. Entering the lounge, she spots Jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. She reads what Jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."" She realizes that Jack has gone mad.Jack approaches from behind and asks sarcastically, ""How do you like it?"" Wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. A confrontation ensues as Jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with Danny, while Wendy retreats, brandishing the bat. She screams at Jack not to hurt her, and he swears that he will not; instead, he intends to kill her. Wendy hits Jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs, causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase, injuring his ankle in the process.Wendy drags Jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside, just as he regains consciousness. Jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio, as well as the snow cat, stranding them all there. She goes outside to check on the snow cat, and confirms what he told her.A few hours later, Jack is roused from a nap by the sound of Delbert Grady's voice. Grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in Jack, but Jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. The pantry door then suddenly unlocks.Wendy has fallen asleep in her room. Danny is in a trance, carrying a knife and muttering ""redrum"" repeatedly. He takes Wendy's lipstick and writes ""REDRUM"" on the bathroom door. He begins shouting ""REDRUM,"" which wakes Wendy. She clutches him to her, then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. Reversed, it reads: ""MURDER."" At that instant, banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway.The sound is Jack swinging an axe at the locked door. Wendy grabs Danny and locks them in the bathroom. She opens a tiny, snow banked window and pushes Danny out; he slides safely to the ground. She tries to get out the same window, but cannot fit. She tells Danny to run and hide.Meanwhile, Jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out ""Wendy, I'm home!"" Jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. Wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as Jack begins chopping into the door. After chopping away one of the panels, he sticks his head through and screams ""Heeeere's JOHNNY!"" (a reference toThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)). Jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. Wendy slashes at him with a knife, cutting Jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. Jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. He stalks out.The snow cat driver is Dick. Inside the hotel, he calls out, but gets no reply. Jack, hiding behind a pillar, leaps out and swings the axe into Dick's chest, killing him. Danny, hiding in a kitchen cabinet, screams, revealing his location. He clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside.Meanwhile, Wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for Danny. The hotel has sprung to life and now even Wendy encounters its ghosts, sights that shock and horrify her. At the same time, axe-wielding Jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows Danny into the hedge maze.Danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for Jack to follow. He carefully retraces his steps, walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction, then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. When Jack arrives, he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly, giving him no clue as to which direction Danny took. He chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. Danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance.Wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as Danny emerges from the maze. Relieved, she flings down the knife and embraces him. Jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. Danny and Wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that Dick used to get to the hotel. Jack, hopelessly lost in the maze, freezes to death.Right before the end credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. An old recording of ""Midnight, the Stars and You"" echoes in the empty hallway. In the center of one picture is a young Jack. The caption reads, ""Overlook Hotel, July 4th Ball, 1921."""

Enos (Rex Everhart), a friendly truck driver from the diner, agrees to give Annie a lift halfway to the camp. During the drive, he warns her about the camp, informing her that a young boy drowned in Crystal Lake in 1957, one year before the double murders occurred. After Enos lets her out, Annie walks on.

Instead she finds a middle-aged woman who introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhees (Betsy Palmer), an ""old friend of the Christys"". Alice hysterically tries to tell her about the murders. Mrs. Voorhees expresses horror at the sight of Brenda's body, but she soon reveals herself to be the mother of the boy who drowned in the lake in 1957.Talking mostly to herself, she blames her son Jason's drowning on the fact that two counselors were having sex and were unaware of Jason's struggling in the lake. She tells Alice that today happens to be Jason's birthday, which Alice beings to worry on where Steve is. Mrs. Voorhees suddenly turns violent and pulls out her bowie knife (thus revealing the bowie knife as well as her class ring on her left ring finger confirming that Mrs. Voorhees is the killer), rushing at Alice, but Alice uses a fireplace poker and temporally knocks Mrs. Voorhees unconscious.

Brubaker,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080474/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The new warden of a small prison farm in Arkansas tries to clean it up of corruption after initially posing as an inmate. When the new warden comes in disguised as an inmate, he sees firsthand all the corruption and scams the guards and prison officials are running. When he reveals himself and starts to implement reforms to stop the corruption, the local business community, who had been benefiting from the scams, fights back, and the corrupt prison system starts making political trouble for the new warden.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> Henry Brubaker is the new warden at Wakefield prison. He makes his entrance as a prisoner in order to get a convict's-eye-view of the real state of the institution. To his horror he finds all manner of abuse and corruption which, after disclosing his real identity, he sets out to correct.—Rob Hartill Newly appointed Arkansas State Wakefield Prison warden Henry Brubaker (Robert Redford) poses as a prisoner and arrives at the penitentiary with other incoming convicts by bus. Brubaker is processed along with the rest of the new inmates. The convicts find there are not enough beds to go around, the food is barely edible, the showers do not work, rapes in the barracks are an everyday occurrence, and inmates are whipped for no reason. At the infirmary, inmates give blood in exchange for money and they pay the cooks for better sandwiches. Brubaker finds a maggot crawling in his food. Later, inmate Larry Lee Bullen (David Keith) is told he has a phone call, but he is taken away and beaten.On sanitation detail, the hurt Bullen and Brubaker clean a foul-smelling stable outside Death Row until another inmate, named Walter (Morgan Freeman), takes Bullen hostage and threatens to kill him unless he speaks to the warden. Brubaker calms the agitated Walter, and reveals that he is the new warden. At first, Walter doesn't believe him, but then he lists his demands, including yellow-painted walls, a picture window, a shag rug, some liquor and a television like the one for the trusties, the corrupt convict-guards that rule the prison. When Walter shows Brubaker where to put the window, Brubaker locks him back in his cell.Trusty Dickie Coombes (Yaphet Kotto) escorts Brubaker to Warden Renfro's (Lee Richardson) office, where Brubaker informs the startled Renfro that he is out of a job. As Brubaker addresses the prison, conveying the new rules, governors assistant, Lillian Gray (Jane Alexander), the Prison Board Chairman John Deach (Murray Hamilton), and a police officer arrive to swear him in. Deach tells Brubaker that he wants to be kept informed about the prison at all times, while Lillian warns the new warden to proceed with caution.Sometime later, Brubaker watches Death Row prisoners adjust to the sunlight when they are let out of their cells, and gives an order for the men to receive fresh air once a day. Not long after, Brubaker learns that a barracks roof has caved in from the rain and rescues the wounded men, but he has trouble getting ambulances to come to the prison.At the infirmary, he discovers that the doctor charges inmates for medical services; although the doctor insists that it has been done for years, Brubaker immediately fires him. In the kitchens, Brubaker tells a trusty in charge that three hundred cases of chili were delivered to the prison to feed fifty trusties. He calculates that the shipment averages about twenty cans a day for each trusty, although other inmates dont have enough to eat.Meanwhile, when lumberyard owner C. P. 'Woody' Woodward (M. Emmet Walsh) visits Brubaker, the warden asks him to rebuild the barracks roof his company once built at no cost, but Woody refuses. Brubaker replies that the prison will no longer supply free labor to Woody's company. As Woody leaves, he warns Brubaker that he will pay a price for his unwillingness to cooperate with the surrounding community.Later, Brubaker reports to Lillian that prison labor is responsible for construction projects in town, and food meant for the inmates has been given to the police department. Soon, the meals improve. Brubaker discovers a cabin inhabited by Huey Rauch (Tim McIntire), a trusty, and his waitress girlfriend on the prison grounds, surrounded by storage sheds stocked with food stolen from the prison kitchens. After firing bureaucrat Willets (Ronald C. Frazier) for allowing the theft, Brubaker sets up an inmate council, headed by three trusties, Dickie, Eddie Caldwell (Everett McGill) and Floyd Birdwell (Joe Spinell) to handle the purchase orders. When Brubaker meets Lillian for drinks and reminds her that the prison needs a real doctor, she asks him to attend a Prison Board meeting to hear a guest warden speak about prison reform.Meanwhile, the trusties become angrier as Brubaker removes their perks. During an inmate council meeting, an inmate named Abraham (Richard Ward) interrupts the meeting to tell Brubaker that he knows where murdered inmates are buried, but later, the trusties Caldwell and Birdwell torture Abraham. At the board meeting, it becomes clear to Brubaker that everyone is making money from the prison and the board members are not interested in bettering the lives of murderers and rapists. As Brubaker walks out of the meeting, Lillian threatens that he will be out of a job if he does not play politics with the board.In the morning, Brubaker sees Abraham's dead body hanging from a flagpole and Dickie warns him that his reforms are resulting in more killings. Although Abraham never had a chance to reveal where to find the graves, Brubaker orders inmates to dig for bodies while the trusties watch.Later, Brubaker meets with Lillian and Prison Board member Senator Hite (John McMartin), who offers to fix the prison boiler and build new barracks if Brubaker stops looking for bodies. When Brubaker reflects that he is being asked to cover up multiple murders, Hite warns that Brubaker could end up in prison for grave robbing. Lillian advises Brubaker to concentrate on the inmates that are alive, but the warden insists that justice will not be served unless the bodies are found. After much digging, coffins are unearthed. Soon, Rauch loses his influence over the other trusties and leaves.When Brubaker learns that Rauch killed Abraham, he forms a posse and searches for him in town. Rauch shoots Bullen dead and Brubaker returns fire, wounding Rauch. At a Prison Board hearing, outside doctors claim that the remains found on the Wakefield Prison grounds make it hard to determine the exact causes of the deaths. When Brubaker is asked his opinion, he tells the board that the state would save money if it shot convicts after their trials instead of incarcerating them at Wakefield. Lillian follows Brubaker out the door and asks him to compromise, but he argues that the Prison Boards position condones murder, and he cannot go along with it. Lillian claims that she is on Brubakers side but he disagrees.When the new warden, Rory Poke, arrives to replace Brubaker and addresses the prison, Dickie tells the former warden that he was right about prison reform. As Brubaker leaves Wakefield Prison, Dickie begins clapping which signals to the other inmates to drop formation and clap for Brubaker in a show of respect."
Little Darlings,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081060/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two fifteen year-old girls from different sides of the tracks compete to see who will be the first to lose their virginity while at a summer camp. Fifteen year olds Ferris Whitney and Angel Bright meet when they attend the same summer camp and are assigned the bunks next to each other in the same cabin. It's hate at first sight as they are seemingly polar opposites: romantic and literate Ferris comes from a wealthy and thus privileged background, while streetwise and chain-smoking Angel is from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks. But they share one similarity: they are both virgins, the only ones of their age in their cabin. Due to pressure from their cabin mates, most specifically the aggressive Cinder Carlson, the two enter into a bet on who will lose their virginity first and by the end of the summer. Ferris, who initially seems more interested in the pursuit of the opposite sex, quickly sets her sights on Gary Callahan, the much older coach at the camp. But Angel finds her own target, namely Randy Adams, an equally streetwise boy attending the camp across the lake. The process becomes a bonding exercise for the two girls, who take divergent paths to their end goal and in dealing with the aftermath of the alleged big events.—Huggo A group of teenage girls from Atlanta, Georgia go to summer camp, an, unbeknownst to the adults, two of them made a bet as to which one will lose her virginity first, with all the girls in camp betting money on the contest. The girls involved in the contest are opposites and rivals: cynical, suspicious and streetwise poor girl Angel Bright (Kristy McNichol) and naive, prissy and romantic rich girl Ferris Whitney (Tatum O'Neal). The rest of the girls divide into two teams, each rooting for or egging on either Ferris or Angel. The two girls the choose guys they want to lose their virginity with. Angel targets Randy Adams (Matt Dillon), a boy from the camp across the lake, and Ferris attempts to seduce Gary Callahan (Armand Assante), the (much older) camp counselor.The girls engage in typical teenage camp behavior, like food fights and singing around a campfire. Both girls discover that sex is not what they thought it would be. Ferris thinks of sex as love and romance and wine and flowers and poetry. She imagines herself swept off her feet by Gary. When she lies about making love with him, Gary gets in trouble for having sex with a fifteen-year-old. She discovers that physical sex can have disagreeable consequences. Her attitude is now more grounded in reality; she has become more like Angel. Meanwhile, Angel approaches the same issue from the other side and learns the opposite lesson. She views the contest as a purely biological action, ""no big deal"" and ""nothing"", as her mother told her. But when she attempts making love with Randy in a boathouse, she becomes confused by scary feelings she did not know she had. She behaves defensively, like she doesn't want this. Now also confused, Randy is discouraged by her recalcitrance and leaves her behind.Angel sees that sex is more than just a mechanical function she can cynically turn on or off. This involves feelings and caring and love. Sex is important, and something she deeply wants. As Randy leaves, she tearfully protests ""But I like you!"" She meets Randy a few days later with a much improved attitude - one closer to Ferris'. This time she pays attention, not to condoms and clothing, but to Randy and her feelings about him. As the novel described this, ""All her fear and resistance melted as they kiss. Soon, she didn't know who was touching whom, only that this was wonderful and right and fine."" Angel has sex in the boathouse, but doesn't tell the other girls. Ferris remains a virgin and lies about an evening of romantic passion (""We had chilled Chablis; the darkness enveloped us"").Eventually, Ferris discovers that sex is not just a fantasy of poetry and flowers and moonlight or something from a novel, that the biological aspect is not necessarily romantic, and Angel discovers that biological sex involves powerful emotions that touch her deeply and transform her soul. Neither girl is quite ready for the emotional aspect that sex brings; When Randy seeks her out, Angel admits that while she likes him, she is not ready for that kind of a relationship (he says they can start over, but Angel observes that it's too late and wouldn't be enough), and Ferris apologizes to Gary. Together, the girls talk with the Camp Director and confess the situation, saving Gary's job. Angel and Ferris, the two outsiders, discover they are more alike than different, and as they return home to their parents, they become best friends."

Using information gleaned clandestinely as to Marino's thoughts on the case, Kate's late teenage son, inventor Peter Miller, uses his inventing and analytical skills to insert himself into the investigation, he coming to Liz's side in believing she the closest to discovering the truth especially as the blonde murderer knows that Liz saw her and thus the murderer may be coming after Liz as her next victim.—Huggo Sensual images of a couple, a man and a woman, making love in the shower.

She tells off her son Peter ""Pete"" Miller (Keith Gordon) because he doesn't want to go to the museum with her: he prefers to stay home working on an improved computer which can count binary numbers up to 20 digits.

Kate says she isn't sure whether putting his own marriage with Mike at risk would be worthwhile.Later, Kate is at the museum. A man sits next to her. She leaves a glove for him. They follow each other around the museum. She loses his sight, so she has an expression which says ""obviously, he wasn't serious about me"", but when he turns around he's there, staring at him.

She has to go to the flat again, but when she gets to the right floor, another blond woman - probably using a wig - with dark sunglasses stabs her with a straight razor. Kate is left for dead, all bloodied. Another couple of people has called the lift: they are discussing the convenience of buying the shares of a particular company. He runs away, but Elizabeth ""Liz"" Blake (Nancy Allen) stares at him. When she looks inside the lift, Kate is still alive. They try to reach out for each other's hand, while the doors of the lift are slowly closing down. In the last second, Liz stares up and in the reflection of the mirror she sees the blonde-wigged woman who is about to cut her hand as well. She backs up. A cleaning lady (Amalie Collier) appears, and she shouts when she looks at Liz with the razor menacingly held by her hand.Elliott finds an answering machine left for a man (William Finlay) saying that there is a woman trying to het out of his body.

The man, Ted (Norman Evans), is from out of the city, and Marino tells Liz that she is the only interested person in finding Ted.When Liz leaves, Pete is also stuck with a man he doesn't love at all - his true father died during the 'Nam war. He tries to investigate the case as well. In his blue moped, he follows Liz all over the city. He arranges a camera to be hidden inside the box at the back of the bike. While he watches Liz, the mysterious man has phoned Elliott again, threatening her.

She leaves a bit distraught. She jumps onto a taxi but realises that somebody is following her. She asks the young taxi driver (Bill Randolph) to lose the follower. The taxi driver wants to meet her for dinner. The taxi driver tries to help Liz: she opens the door of the taxi when the blonde lady is following Liz. Liz runs to the underground, but when she tries to leave another blonde transsexual or travesty scares her off. Liz approaches some black men (Robert Lee Rush, Anthony Boyd Scriven, Robert McDuffie and Frederick Sanders) who are listening to the radio, but one of them, called Sonny, threatens her as the train arrives.Liz tells the police officer (Samm-Art Williams), who ends up thinking she is making it all up, because he can't see any gang threatening to ""cut her up"", and Liz's claims that a blonde is following her leave the officer even more convinced that she's mad. In the next station, the police officer leaves. When the doors close, the gang appears again, just causing a nuisance to all passengers. Liz runs from them and closes one door behind. At that moment, the blonde woman puts a hand on her mouth and wants to slash her with another straight razor. Fortunately, Pete saves Liz using an anti-rape spray of his invention. Liz invites him over. Pete sleeps at Liz's, and she promises that he won't tell anyone that he's not studying French with at his friend Paul's. Liz tells him that she knows that the blonde woman left the doctor's office, but she can't explain how she knows it. As Marino can't get a register order like that, he suggests her to enter Elliott's office and check the doctor's agenda.Dr. Levy (David Margulies) tells Elliott that one of her patients Bobby / Bobbi (William Finlay) has stopped seeing him because he didn't approve of his sex change. Elliott tells Levy that Bobbi must be the murderer of the lady in the lift, and they also comment on the missing razor. Later, Liz pretends to be a new patient of dr Elliott. She tells him about an erotic dream of her, but also admits that she's a prostitute, although she sometimes makes love to men for pleasure. She gets naked trying to seduce him. During all this time, Pete is watching with some lens. Liz checks the address book of dr Elliott and she thinks that the name she's looking for is Chris Clemens. Pete tries to to tell her that the blonde woman is inside the office - he's seen it - but a blonde woman has attacked him, so when he finally can cry out to Liz the blonde woman is already prepared to slash her with a Straight Razor.At that moment, the blonde woman who is holding Pete down shoots Bobbi.The wig falls off. The blonde woman is a wounded man. It's the doctor Robert Elliott.Some time later, Levy, Marino, Pete and Liz are sitting down. Levy explains that Elliott had a double personality: he was the masculine doctor but he was also a patient who wanted to have a sex change performed, and giving Bobbi as his name, he visited doctor Levy. Levy says that Elliott represent Bobbi, but that when Bobbi decided to go for the sex change surgery, that pushed him to act. Levy said that every time that doctor Elliott felt attracted by a woman her alter-ego killed that woman. The blonde woman who attacked Pete was police officer Betty Luke (Susanna Clemm), who was in charge of following Liz. Marino pushed her to enter dr Elliott's address book because he didn't have any proofs against him.Liz explains to Pete how a sex change operation takes place. He replies, sitting confortably at a restaurant with her, that he may change the subject of his investigation, and use himself as the subject of that sex change, instead of investigating about computers.Meanwhile, back at a madhouse, a nurse (Anneka di Lorenzo) walks in to give Dr Elliott the medicine he must take. He looks defenseless and sleepy, but he jumps and strangles her. All the loose madmen cheer. Pete invites her to sleep at his home, saying that his step-father won't mind.Naked in the shower, Liz feels some danger. Somebody dressed as a nurse approaches, and she knows it. She doesn't have anything to defend herself in the bathroom, except for something in the medicine cabinet. However, suddenly, the razor is at Liz's neck. The same blonde woman cuts Liz's neck.Terrified, Liz wakes up in a bedroom at Pete's. He tries to calm her down.FADE TO BLACK"

Raging Bull,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081398/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life of boxerJake LaMotta, whose violence and temper that led him to the top in the ring destroyed his life outside of it. WhenJake LaMottasteps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter. But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone.—alfiehitchie The story of middleweight boxing championJake LaMotta, famously dubbed, ""The Raging Bull"" and ""The Bronx Bull"". Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" chronicles two decades of his life, and how the violence inside the ring was only an extension of his violence and temper outside of it.—Liam Alexander The life of Bronx-basedJake LaMottaduring his professional middleweight boxing career from 1941 to the mid-1950s, and his immediate post-boxing life is dramatized. Managed for most of his boxing career by his brother Joey LaMotta, Jake has the goal not only of getting the title fight at almost any cost - the one thing he unwilling to do to demonstrate that he is the best and in his ""my way or the high way"" mentality is to be knocked out, even if it is for a longer term benefit - but also to have the most fame possible, which means the improbable fantasy of becoming a heavyweight. While not managed by them, much of his career is affected by his and Joey's mafia connections. Despite his boxing prowess, Jake, to reach his own personal goals, has to overcome his disagreements with what the mafia wants and his own brutish behavior, which spills over into his personal life. That personal life shown largely is during the time of what is his second marriage, to Vickie LaMotta, a girl he spotted in the neighborhood. Their relationship is punctuated by jealousy and paranoia on Jake's side, he who becomes to believe that Vickie is sleeping with every man to who she pays any attention, those feelings by Jake which leads to emotional and physical abuse.—Huggo Loosely based on the life and career of boxer Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro in an Oscar-winning performance), this Martin Scorsese classic focuses on Jake's rage and violence that makes him virtually unstoppable in the ring. The same anger also drives Jake to beat his wife and his brother Joey, and sends Jake down a self-destructive spiral of paranoia and rage. In 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine.In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves (Floyd Anderson), where Jake suffered his first loss (Jake had knocked out Reeves in the later rounds, but under Ohio state boxing rules, the results take into account the points in the first 10 rounds of the match). Jake's brother, Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci), discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Jake is a middleweight, but wants to fight the heavy weight champ Joe Louis (Coley Wallace) and knows that he will never get a shot at that title.Some time thereafter, Jake spots a fifteen-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her (goes on dates with her, even though Salvy was interested in her), even though he is already married (to Irma LaMotta (Lori Anne Flax).. Irma and Jake don't get along and have screaming matches all day along in their apartment).In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the Army the following week. By 1945 (after defeating a few more opponents), Jake marries Vickie.Soon, JOe also gets married and both Jake and Joe have kids with their wives.
Jake constantly worries about Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro (Kevin Mahon), Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro (in the ring) in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox (Eddie Mustafa Muhammad), after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan (Louis Raftis).A year later in 1950, Jake asks Joey if he fought with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey had an affair with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake directly asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joey's house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of Joey's wife Lenora (Theresa Saldana) and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious.After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille (Johnny Turner) in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake's career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.By 1956, Jake and his family have moved to Miami. After he stays out all night at his new nightclub there, Vickie tells him she wants a divorce (which she has been planning since his retirement) as well as full custody of their kids. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. He is later arrested for introducing under-age girls to men in his club. He tries and fails to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt instead of selling the belt itself. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon Joey, who forgives him but is elusive.Again in 1964, Jake now recites the ""I could have been a contender"" scene from the 1954 film On the Waterfront, where Terry Malloy complains that his brother should have been there for him but is also keen enough to give himself some slack. After a stagehand informs him that the auditorium where he is about to perform is crowded, Jake starts to chant ""I'm the boss"" while shadowboxing."
American Gigolo,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080365/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Los Angeles male escort, who mostly caters to an older female clientèle, is accused of a murder which he did not commit. Julian makes a lucrative living as an escort to older women in the Los Angeles area. He begins a relationship with Michelle, a local politician's wife, without expecting any pay. One of his clients is murdered and Detective Sunday begins pumping him for details on his different clients, something he is reluctant to do considering the nature of his work. Julian begins to suspect he's being framed. Meanwhile Michelle begins to fall in love with him.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Julian Kaye is a high end Los Angeles based male prostitute, his clientele comprised almost solely of older well appointed women. He does well financially with all the material trappings of wealth. He got his start working for Anne, who largely taught him the ropes of the business. While she still procures some of his clients on a 60/40 split, Julian drums up most of his own business on a 100 percent take, that business either by word of mouth or prowling the upscale hotel bars for lonely foreign female tourists, he fluent in six languages to be able to make those contacts. Despite Anne's objections to him going freelance, he went this route to have some control in what he still sees as a somewhat personal matter of with who he sleeps. He does not do gay business and stays away from quick tricks and kink, which is why he is so peeved upon finding the kink wants of clients the Rheimans, this job which he does as last minute replacement as a favor for a pimp acquaintance named Leon. It is during one of his cruises through a hotel bar that Julian meets Michelle Stratton. Despite she not being the potential client he thought she was as she is a married local waiting for a friend as opposed to a lonely foreign tourist, she nonetheless searches him out later for sex. They begin a relationship, for her he being someone to fill the physical and emotional void in her own marriage to her largely absent husband. Julian later discovers that her husband is Senator Charles Stratton, with the emotional void in their marriage being that he treats her more as a political prop than a wife. Julian's life starts to go sour when Judy Rheiman is found viciously murdered during what appears to be one of those rough sex acts the Rheimans requested from him. A suspect in the murder, Julian admits to one of the investigators, LAPD Vice Detective Joe Sunday, that he did have rough sex with Judy Rheiman in a previous encounter, but that he was with another client at the time of the murder. As discretion is part and parcel of the business, Julian's wealthy client, Lisa Williams, fails to corroborate his alibi, while Julian slowly begins to believe that someone is trying to frame him. With news spreading as to Julian's involvement in the murder, he becomes an untouchable property. While Julian goes on a desperate search for who is framing him and why so as to save not only his livelihood but his life, Michelle, who is beginning to have true feelings for him, has to decide how far she will go to help him at the risk of her own standing in the community, with Julian conversely having to decide how much he is willing to have her risk of her life to help him.—Huggo Julian Kay (Richard Gere) is a gigolo ; a young man who makes a living as a wealthy ladies' escort. His official pimp/employer, Anne (Nina Van Pallandt) realizes that he is her star prostitute despite not being faithful to her. A small 'chauffeur' gig is planned for the next day, but Julian looks more interested in getting a higher percentage of the profits than in the practical contact details. After bargaining some more, Julian leaves and refuses to suntan with other two girls (Michele Drake and Linda Horn). We learn that Anne has been carefully preparing a highly-paid job with a Swedish woman who is about to arrive in Los Angeles.Julian trains at home to keep fit when a gay pimp, Leon James (Bill Duke) calls to ask him to act as a sub for an urgent gig to be played the next day in Palm Springs, some 110 miles // -2 hrs drive from LA. Julian, reluctant, finally accepts for 90% of the fees agreed with client. Leon chokes but has no other choice than greedy Julian... Julian does his chauffeur gig for a rich widow. He looks forward to meet the lady again for more and so reports to Anne afterwards. Sometimes Julian tries to find his own clients, so he makes a pass at Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton), who is sitting alone at a high-end restaurant. In the ensuing conversation, Michelle sees Julian for what he is, although he claims to be only hired as a guide, a translator or a chauffeur. No deal is closed that night, and Julian leaves alone.Later in Palm Springs, Tom Rheiman (Tom Stewart) wants Julian to beat his wife Judy (Patricia ""Patti"" Carr) while making love to her from behind. Although Julian does not like that kind of jobs (S&M and bondage), he's already been paid, and he's already there, so it's understood that he complies.Two nights after that, Julian learns in the papers that Judy Rheiman was assaulted and killed in Palm Springs . Later, he goes with Lisa Williams (K Callan) at Sotheby's Parke-Bernet to choose the bric-a-brac needed to redecorate her mansion. They have fun and laugh together. There is then an incident when Julian pretends to be gay in front of a casual, embarrassing acquaintance of Lisa (Faye Michael Nuell) and he almost breaks a valuable porcelain into pieces in the attempt to get quickly rid of the lady. Right after that, Julian and Lisa leave the place laughing.Michelle appears at Julian's apartment. Many people know who he is and where he lives, so she only had to ask. At first, he says to her that he doesn't work in his own apartment, but she talks to him and they end up going to bed together. Afterwards, Michelle talks about how her marriage to politician Charles Stratton (Brian Davies) is void of love or emotion. He advises her to start thinking about herself, because it looks that the only reason for the marriage to stay together is because it would be damaging to Stratton's political career.The next day, LAPD Detective Sunday (Hector Elizondo) arrives at Julian's apartment in L.A. to question him about the death of Judy Rheiman in Palm Springs. She was killed, and Julian says (quite arrogantly), that she was with Lisa Williams choosing the decorations at the time of the crime. Detective Sunday leaves without arresting Julian, but warns him not to leave town for he may return to ask more questions.Julian keeps on seeing his clients. For example, Mrs Laudner takes him to a political party where the main guest is Stratton. He greets him and his wife, pretending not knowing her (and vice-versa). When Julian inquires about gossips concerning the Strattons, Mrs Laudner says that Michelle is very sad. As Michelle keeps on meeting Julian whenever she can, something which gets noticed by her husband, Julian starts being followed by a political aide of Stratton. Julian decides to face the beat and talk to Stratton directly. Charles Stratton tries to buy him up with $5,000 to stop seeing his wife, which Julian refuses, as he has started to feel really interested in Michelle. Stratton warns him about the good graces of his small HiSo supports to end soon, if he persists to see Michelle.Another day or two later, Sunday follows Julian to his usual shoeshine parlor. He says there were handcuff marks over previous handcuff bruises on Judy's wrists, meaning Julian lied when he said he never handcuffed her during the gig done for Leon. Since Lisa Williams had said to the detectives that Julian left her at 7:00 pm in the evening, not later, and basically denying that they had a sexual relationship together, Sunday states there was enough time for Julian to drive to Palm Springs back and forth plus commit the crime... Julian has to go to the police station for a line-up, but the witness is not sure about him being the person who went to Judy Rheiman's home earlier that day. Julian feeds a protestation from a fellow inmate obliged to participate in the line-up. Later, Sunday and Lt. Curtis (David Cryer) talk with Julian again at the LAPD. Sunday laughs at the situation, because in his previous visit Julian had given him some advice to be more attractive to ladies and he is trying to improve his overall appearance. Julian stays free after the key witness could not formally identify him during the line-up.Julian starts to get worried. He needs an alibi for the night of the crime. Next, he goes to the Williams' house, but Lisa doesn't want to acknowledge that she ever met him: the police has been to her home with a restraining order against Julian. Mr. Williams (Richard Derr) also appears, and he coldly dismisses Julian saying that on the night of the crime Lisa was with him all the time.Julian meets Leon at a gay disco and asks him to give him an alibi, what he finally seems to agree. Leon even suggests that Rheiman is the real culprit, as he is a 'freak'.The police search Julian's apartment during his absence, leaving it in a total mess.Later, Julian meets Michelle in a botanical park; she must leave for two months in Europe on her husband's orders, until the polls are over. Julian states the news are hard to stand.Once back home, Julian recognizes Leon's blonde boyfriend (Gordon Haight) leaving quickly the garage in his vintage Porsche 911. Julian gets really paranoid and he creates havoc in his apartment to find the jewels who have been said stolen at the Rheimans' in Palm Springs and are still missing. He finally finds them hidden in his luxurious car - a car he had to tear to pieces in order the find the jewels. He grabs the plastic pouch and decides to leave quickly for downtown, where he rents a plain Ford Pinto to pursue his quest for help.Julian calls Anne for help and accepts a short notice rendez-vous at the Perino's. Calling Jill (Jessica Potter) at his reception, he learns that the police are sitting there waiting for him and that Michelle tried to meet him urgently.
Showing dirty and jacketless at the Perino's, he is told off by the maître d'hôtel (Harris Weingart) because of his untidy look. There, Anne does not want to know anything about him: Julian forgot about picking the European lady at the airport, destroying a big deal arranged months ago. Anne gets really mad at him, and she does not want to work with him again nor help him through. As she has always been disappointed with Julian, who got clients on his own, and worked for other bosses sometimes now it's her opportunity to let him go. Julian, who had told Jill about the place he would be, notices Michelle at a table near. They meet shortly in the restroom and Julian requests from Michelle that she forgets everything about him, since he is framed and lost.Julian stalks Leon in the red light zones, but to no avail. He waits until the dawn near his home and finally sees him arriving along with his blonde BF. He shows up at Leon's flat, is granted access while his blonde boy hides then leaves discreetly; Julian argues again about the alibi he needs now. But Leon states that some things from the Rheiman's house, linked to the murder, have appeared at Julian's apartment and have being seized by the police ; that the 'bitch' from Palm Springs reviewed definitely her eyewitness report about Julian having been seen at the Rheimans house... So that Julian is obviously the ideal culprit and thus will fall alone.Julian throws the jewels pouch at Leon who ignores the thing. Julian tries to explain the case: blonde boy may have killed Judy Rheiman during a hardcore gig, then the husband arranged with Leon to frame him. Leon does not say anything. Julian offers to work for Leon the way he wants, to break in new boys, do any tricks... As this doesn't work, he offers to pay Leon a lot of money, but Leon says that the person who's framing him will always rise the bet higher than him. As an answer to Julian's ""why me?"" question, Leon reveals he was precisely the lonesome, self-centered and toe-crushing guy ideal for the role. Leon then asks Julian to leave while he greets the blonde boy from the balcony. In an ensuing rage, Julian runs after him, pushes him so Leon ends up falling down the balcony; but he is grabbed at the latest moment by Julian who holds tight Leon's legs - but his feet slip out of his boots and he falls many floors below. Julian stays stunned in Leon's apartment, all his hopes to escape the frame being lost.
Since a maid who happened to be around testified that Julian tried to pull Leon to safety, he goes to jail on the sole charge of Judy Rheiman's murder.There is a lot of media interest on Julian's case, as his profession has been disclosed. Michelle visits Julian in jail to inform him that she is willing to give up everything to be with him. Feeling that all has been lost, Julian asks Michelle not to see him again. However, Michelle pays for Julian's defense who changes his old-time lawyer (Peter Turgeon) for a new one (William Dozier).However, Julian will not be freed until Michelle finally faces Lt Curtis. The detective already knows that she's paying for Julian's defense lawyer. She says that doing so, she wants to show Julian's innocence, because she was with her that night of the crime. In the final scene, Michelle has already revealed her secret, and media immediately has set camp in front of the Strattons', so she cannot go back anyway. Although they are still talking through a glass, it's implied that Julian will soon be freed and that they will be together."

The Fog,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080749/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An unearthly fog rolls into a small coastal town exactly 100 years after a ship mysteriously sank in its waters. Against the backdrop of spine-chilling stories of drowned mariners and a 100-year-old shipwreck lying on the bottom of the sea, the peaceful coastal town of Antonio Bay, California is making preparations to celebrate its centennial. However--as strange supernatural occurrences blemish the festivities--a dense fog starts to shroud the seaside town, leading to unaccountable disappearances. A century ago, a hideous crime was committed by the town's elders. Now, the restless dead have returned for revenge. Is there something evil lurking in the fog?—Nick Riganas Strange things begin to occur as a tiny California coastal town prepares to commemorate its centenary. Inanimate objects spring eerily to life; Rev. Malone (Holbrook) stumbles upon a dark secret about the town's founding; radio announcer Stevie (Barbeau) witnesses a mystical fire; and hitchhiker Elizabeth (Curtis) discovers the mutilated corpse of a fisherman. Then a mysterious iridescent fog descends upon the village, and more people start to die. As the centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay, California approaches, paranormal activity begins to occur at midnight. 100 years ago, the wealthy leper Blake bought the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane and sailed with his people to form a leper colony. However, while sailing through a thick fog, they were deliberately misguided by a campfire onshore, steering the course of the ship toward the light and crashing it against the rocks. While the town's residents prepare to celebrate, the victims of this heinous crime that the town's founders committed rise from the sea to claim retribution. Under cover of the ominous glowing fog, they carry out their vicious attacks, searching for what is rightly theirs.—Tim Kretschmann <Tim.K@VirComm.com> The centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay, California has arrived, though the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town's residents. A conspiracy led by the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a terrible shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that it would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use the fortune to build the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a thick fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the campfire onshore. Now the ominous glowing fog that led them to their doom has returned, bringing with it the ghosts of the crew as they seek revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay.—Derek O'Cain Taking place in a Northern California fishing town called Antonio Bay, the town is about to celebrate its centennial on April 21, 1980, and are having a celebration led by Kathy Williams (Janet Leigh). However, the centennial is also marked by ominous events, including the appearance of a glowing fog that spreads over land and sea.In the first scene, on the night before the town's celebration, a group of children seated around a campfire on a beach, are entertained by a ghost story, told by 'old' Mr. Machen (John Houseman) (exactly at the stroke of midnight), the resident elderly fisherman. The story being told is indicative of the history of the town's formation, which is being discovered at that exact moment by the local priest, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), when he finds the diary of his grandfather (who was also the town's priest).The diary later reveals a dark secret unknown to the current inhabitants where, in 1880, six of the founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank and plundered the Elizabeth Dane, a clipper ship owned by Blake, a wealthy man with leprosy who wanted to establish a colony near Antonio Bay. The six conspirators lit a fire on the beach near treacherous rocks, and the crew of the clipper, deceived by the false beacon, crashed into them. Everyone aboard the ship perished. The six conspirators were motivated both by greed and disgust at the notion of having a leper colony nearby. Antonio Bay and its church were then founded with the gold plundered from the ship.The mysterious fog contains the vengeful ghosts of Blake and the clipper's crew, who have come back on the 100th anniversary of the shipwreck and the founding of the town to apparently take the lives of six people (symbolic substitutes for the six conspirators). This same night, three local fishermen, Al Williams, Tommy Wallace and Dick Baxter, are gruesomely murdered by supernatural attackers after the fog covers their boat. Just before their deaths, Al and Tommy are standing on the deck of the boat and can see a ghostly looking ship pulling along side theirs, through the dense, but glowing fog.At the same time, Nick Castle (Tom Atkins) drives down a country road and picks up a hitchhiker named Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis) who claims to be on her way to Vancouver. While the two drive towards town, the radio and headlights of the car start to fail, as the windows of the truck are blown out. At the same time, various odd phenomena begin to happen around the sleeping town (chairs move, television sets turn themselves on, gas stations seemingly come to life). A short time later, Nick and Elizabeth have arrived at Nick's coastal home and are relaxing when a heavy knock is heard at the door. Making his way to open the glass, front door, Nick sees an odd light shining outside, illuminating a shadowy figure. The clock strikes 1 a.m., and it's face suddenly cracks, just as Nick opens the door, only to see there is no one there, and the fog has dissipated.The following morning, while in her bungalow next to the beach, the local radio DJ Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) is lying in bed when her young son, Andy, returns to the house showing her a broken plank of wood he has discovered. It reads ""DANE"". Intrigued by the piece, Stevie keeps it and takes it with her to the lighthouse, where she is preparing for her next show and listening to various promotional tapes for her station. Stevie sets the plank on top of the tape player that is playing the promotional spots, and while she is momentarily distracted, the plank begins to seep water. The water spreads and causes the tape player to short. Suddenly, Blake's voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, the words ""6 Must Die"" appear on the plank, and the plank bursts into flames. A shocked Stevie immediately extinguishes the fire. Afterwards, Stevie checks the plank only to find that it once again reads ""DANE"".Meanwhile, Nick and Elizabeth charter a boat and embarch on a search for the missing fishing boat, called the Sea Grass. Soon, they find the boat where the fishermen were killed. After looking around the deserted boat, they go below decks, and Elizabeth finds the eyeless corpse of Dick Baxter, the youngest of the three fishermen. They then take Baxter's body to the local coroner's office to be examined by Dr. Phibes. Phibes, who is perplexed by the body's advanced state of decomposition, takes Nick aside to ask him about the circumstances of the body's discovery and leaves Elizabeth alone in the autopsy room with Baxter's corpse. The body becomes momentarily re-animated by a ghost. It rises from the steel autopsy table, grabs a scalpel, and walks over to Elizabeth. As Baxter's corpse moves closer to Elizabeth, she screams, and the body drops to the floor, lifeless once again. Elizabeth's screams bring Nick and Phibes rushing back into the autopsy room, where they see that the corpse has scratched the number ""3"" into the floor with the scalpel.Back in Antonio Bay town center, the town's celebration begins. At the same time, Dan (Charles Cypress), the local weatherman, and Stevie talk over the phone. Stevie expresses her apprehension about the strange glowing fog that is moving toward the town. Dan then hears a knock at the weather station's door and leaves Stevie on the phone while he goes to answer it. Dan is killed when he opens the door and one of the ghosts impales him through the throat with a hook, and Stevie listens in horror.Just when the ghosts of the fog cut the phone lines as well as sabotage the power for the entire town, Stevie begins her radio broadcast and begs someone to get to her house and save her son when she sees the fog roll up to the house. Nick and Elizabeth hear this over Nick's truck radio and go to help. Back at Stevie's house, a strange knock comes at the door. The elderly babysitter goes to answer it and tells Andy to go to his room. When she opens the door, the ghosts come out of the fog and impale her on their swords and hooks. The ghosts then go after Andy. Nick arrives just in time and takes Andy in his car. A minute of tension begins when Elizabeth, driving Nick's truck, attempts to flee with him, but gets stuck in a road pothole as the fog surrounds the truck and the ghosts slowly emerge towards them. At the last second, Elizabeth managed to free the truck from the pothole and drive in reverse, away from the ghosts and out of the fog.As the celebration in town comes to an end, Kathy and her assistant drive home in the same car. When they turn on the radio, they hear Stevie repeatedly telling people to stay away from the fog as it is dangerous. When the fog appears, they drive away from it. They then hear Stevie saying the only safe place is the church, which they go to. Nick, Elizabeth and Andy hear the same message and they also go to the church. They all meet in the church as well as Father Malone, and they hide in the small backroom. While they are in the room, Kathy and Father Malone find some of the stolen gold, which has been melted into a cross. Blake's ghost and his crew begin to break into the room. Knowing he is the offspring of the last conspirator, Father Malone confronts the ghosts with the golden cross in an attempt to sacrifice himself and save everyone else.Back at the lighthouse, the fog closes in and several of the ghosts attempt to attack Stevie. She climbs onto the roof with the ghosts in hot pursuit, trapping her. The ghosts slowly close in on her and get ready to attack. Back in the church, Blake's ghost grabs the golden cross. The golden cross begins to glow and the church rumbles as the light emanating from the cross becomes brighter and brighter. Only seconds before Blake's ghost and the cross disappear in a flash and a thunder, Nick manages to pull Father Malone away from the cross. With Blake's ghost, the other ghosts also suddenly disappear. At the lighthouse, Stevie gets down from the roof and makes it back to safety. The fog suddenly disappears and most of the town's people are saved.Stevie begins her radio broadcast and warns most of the ships at the ocean to look across the water into the darkness for the fog. Later that night when Father Malone is alone in the church, he asks himself ""Why not me, Blake?"". At that moment, the fog suddenly reappears inside the church along with Blake and his crew. Blake swings his sword at Father Malone's head, decapitating him as the screen cuts to black."
Altered States,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080360/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psycho-physiologist experiments with drugs and a sensory-deprivation tank and has visions he believes are genetic memories. In the late 1960s, just for a lark, graduate student Eddie Jessup, known for being unconventional, brilliant and slightly mad, conducts experiments with an isolation chamber, using himself as the subject. His experiences in the chamber cause him to hallucinate, much of the imagery being religious-based although he's not religious. Seven years later, he is a respected full professor in the Harvard Medical School. Believing he has lost his edge and fallen into an unwanted state of respectability, Eddie decides to resume his work with sensory deprivation, this time using hallucinogens, specifically untested ones used in mystical Mexican rituals, to enhance the isolation-take experience. After initial tests, he claims he entered an alternate physical and mental state. Although unbelieving of Eddie's claims, his colleagues Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish, as well as Eddie's wife Emily, herself a respected academic, are concerned for Eddie's well being. However, if Eddie's claims are indeed true, he could do irreparable harm to himself and others around him, especially if his altered states are uncontrollable.—Huggo Respected scientist and psychology professor Edward Jessup decides to combine his experiments in sensory deprivation tanks with powerful hallucinogenic drugs, convinced it may help him unlock different states of consciousness.

Cruising,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080569/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A police detective goes undercover in the underground S&M gay subculture of New York City to catch a serial killer who is preying on gay men. A serial killer brutally slays gay men in New York's S&M bars. The young police officer, Steve Burns, goes undercover to find the murderer. Working almost completely isolated from his department, he has to learn and practice the complex rules and signals of this little society. But the work starts changing him.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> West Village, Manhattan. A string of sadistic murders terrorises the regulars of the neighbourhood's underground S&M clubs. As a result, lured by the promise of rapid promotion, novice patrolman Steve Burns unwisely enters the shady world of an unspoken subculture. But some doors are best left closed. And with the sadistic serial killer still on the loose, Burns soon realises he has bitten off more than he can chew; in this dangerous alien underworld, ill-advised one-night stands lead to agonising death. Now, the high-stakes cat-and-mouse game threatens everything Steve holds dear, including his soul. When cruising for a killer, can one emerge unscathed?—Nick Riganas A severed human arm is found floating in the Hudson River, and Detective Lefransky (Randy Jurgensen) from the New York Police Deparment orders forensic scientist, Dr. Rifkin (Barton Heyman), to match the arm to a torso found earlier.That evening, in a predominantly gay neighborhood in Manhattan, patrolman DiSimone (Joe Spinell) and his partner, Desher (Mike Starr), order two transvestite prostitutes into their police car and sexually harass them. Nearby, a man (Richard Cox) wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket enters a gay nightclub filled with homosexual men dancing, kissing, and publicly performing acts of sadomasochism. A patron named Loren Lukas (Arnaldo Santana) approaches the man in sunglasses and propositions him for sex; soon after, they leave the nightclub and get a room at the St. James Hotel, where the man in sunglasses ties Lukas's hands and feet together, sings the words, ""I'm here, you're here, we're here,"" and stabs him to death. The murder tells the dead Lukas, ""you made me do that"".At the forensics lab, Rifkin examines Lukas's body and informs Captain Edelson (Paul Sorvino) that the killer's DNA cannot be determined from ejaculate found inside the body's rectum because the semen contains no sperm (indicating that the killer is sterile). Later, Edelson questions DaVinci (Gene Davis), one of the two transvestite prostitutes stopped by DiSimone and Desher, and shows him mug shots of potential suspects. DaVinci provides information, then tells Edelson that patrolman DiSimone forced him to perform oral sex the other night, but Edelson refuses to believe him.Later that day, Steve Burns (Al Pacino), a young policeman, reports to Edelson's office where he is briefed on Lukas's killing as well as the murder of Paul Vincent, a gay college professor. Edelson believes the same killer committed each crime, and asks Steve to investigate the case undercover, posing as a homosexual, because he looks like the two victims.In bed with his girlfriend, Nancy (Karen Allen), Steve tells her that he must go away for a while and cannot talk about his assignment. He only tells Nancy that although his ""deep undercover"" job is potentially dangerous, it will allow him to skip patrol duties and become a detective.In a predominantly gay area of the West Village, Steve moves into an apartment and meets his neighbor, a young homosexual man named Ted Bailey (Don Scardino). Steve introduces himself as ""John Forbes,"" and joins Ted at a café, where they eat lunch and discuss the recent killings in the neighborhood. At night, Steve visits gay bars and observes the large crowds of gay men that frequent each one late at night. Slowly acclimating to the scene, he lifts weights at home and applies makeup before going out.One night, the killer meets Eric Rossman (Larry Atlas) in a park, and they head to the woods to have sex; however, they become separated, and the killer taunts Rossman with the same song he sang before Lukas's murder. The killer then sneaks up on Rossman and stabs him to death. ""You made me do that"" says the killer.Emotionally disturbed by the investigation, Steve sleeps with Nancy at her apartment and tells her he does not want to lose her. Later, Steve attends a ""Precinct Night"" at a gay club, where patrons dress up as policemen (one the patrons is DiSimone), but Steve is kicked out by the bouncer for not wearing the proper costume (Steve wears his black leather jacket and black jeans). Outside the club, a young man named Skip Lee (Jay Acovone) propositions Steve for sex, but Burns rejects him. When he returns to Nancy's apartment and makes love to her, Steve continues to hear sounds from the gay nightclub in his mind.Sometime later, fashion designer Martino Perry (Steve Inwood) visits an adult bookstore and follows the killer into a peep show booth. As they watch an adult film together, Perry lowers to his knees to go down on him, and the killer grabs a knife and stabs Perry in the back.At the police station, the Chief of Detectives (Allan Miller) visits after hearing about this latest murder and orders Edelson to solve the murders before the upcoming Democratic National Convention.At a nightclub, Steve asks a bartender about Skip Lee, the young man who recently propositioned him, and learns that Lee has a bad reputation for being violent.Detective Lefransky finds DaVinci, the transvestite, on the street, and DaVinci tells him that Lee works at The Iron Horse, a steakhouse. There, Lefransky and Detective Schrieber (Ed O'Neil) obtain a steak knife used by patrons. Examining the knife, Rifkin determines that it might match the killer's weapon. Soon after, Steve finds Lee at a club, takes him to a motel room, and asks Lee to tie him up, while policemen listen to the interaction on a surveillance device. Shortly after, police burst into the motel room and arrest Burns and Lee. Though Lee appears to be innocent, they force him to provide a semen sample; however, it contains sperm and therefore does not match the killer's.At her apartment, Nancy asks Steve why he no longer seems attracted to her, and he blames the undercover work. At Nancy's suggestion, they agree to break up for a while. Steve then meets Edelson and tells him he can no longer handle the job, but Edelson insists he needs Steve to continue the investigation and gives him a yearbook from Columbia University. In the yearbook, Edelson has marked the names of Paul Vincent's former students, believing one of them might be the killer. Burns recognizes one of the students, Stuart Richards, and finds his address.Steve locates Richards' apartment and begins staking it out. Steve follows Richards and breaks into his apartment one day when he is out. Inside, he finds a box of letters Richards has written to his father, Jack, but never mailed. In the letters, Richards describes his dark thoughts. When he returns home, Richards realizes someone has broken in and spots Steve outside his window on the fire escape ladder. Richards then walks to the nearby park and imagines he sees his father sitting on a bench. Recalling the murders he has committed, Richards apologizes to his father, who seems to disapprove of his son. Before leaving, Richards hears his father say, ""You know what you have to do.""Steve returns to his apartment building and knocks on Ted's door, but Ted's roommate/lover, Gregory Milanese (James Remar), answers. Assuming Ted and Burns are having an affair, Gregory threatens him with a knife after they have a physical altercation.Steve later waits outside Richards's apartment until Richards emerges and heads to the park. They meet at a bench and Steve invites Richards back to his apartment, but Richards suggests they go to the nearby tunnel instead. Steve agrees, and inside the tunnel, takes his pants off. Ordering Richards to do the same, Steve watches as Richards slips a knife from his boot. Wielding his own knife, Steve stabs Richards in the gut and places him under arrest.At the hospital, Edelson tells Richards that the police matched his fingerprint to a quarter used at the peep show at the time of Perry's killing, and promises to reduce his sentence if he confesses to all of the murders. As Burns leaves, Edelson welcomes him to the detective division. Meanwhile, detectives collect evidence from Richards's apartment and learn that his father died ten years ago.Some time later, patrolman DiSimone briefs Edelson inside Ted Bailey's apartment, where Ted's body has been found, stabbed to death, and Edelson realizes that Steve Burns lived next door while working under cover. He also comes to realize that DiSimone knows all about DaVinci when the policeman makes a slip about the transvestite.In the final scene, Nancy finds Steve at her apartment, and he tells her he is moving back in with her. While she waits for him to shave off his beard that he grew during his undercover work, Nancy finds a leather jacket, police hat, and a pair of sunglasses left behind by Steve and tries them on. Unbeknownst to her, it's the same outfit Richards wore when he committed the murders."

Also on the carrier is Warren Lasky, a systems analyst for one of the corporations that designed and built the ship; he is to observe the Nimitz on its maneuvers.One of the ship's sonar crew notices a large and unusual storm approaching the Nimitz. When Yelland orders the ship's course to be changed, the storm follows - just as a Corsair reports it cannot land on the ship due to damage to the plane's tail hook. Yelland orders alert just before the storm overtakes them and swallows them. The Nimitz emerges from the storm unharmed and is able to land the stray Corsair that went through as well. Yelland orders reports from all stations and the ship appears to be in perfect order. The radio operator of the boat receives strange broadcasts from Hawaii; they sound like classic radio from the pre-World War II era, leaving everyone puzzled. A photo reconnaissance aircraft is sent up to take photos of Pearl Harbor, and when it returns the photos prompt Yelland to bring up the ship's Wing Commander, Richard Owens, who is also a World War II history expert; he compares the shots to several from a book he has and he determines that they are nearly identical and that fleet in Pearl at the present moment was sunk by the Japanese Imperial Air Force nearly 40 years before.The ship's radar operator reports the presence of a small boat several hundred miles from the Nimitz. Yelland has two F14s launched to investigate. The nearby boat is a yacht, the personal boat of a popular United States Senator, Samuel Chapman and his personal assistant, Laurel Scott, whom are enjoying a day in the sun. They spot the two F14s as they pass over the boat, unable to comprehend the speed of the jets. The F14s then receive word of another pair of radar contacts and when they're spotted, one pilot excitedly reports that the two contacts are World War II era Japanese ""Zero"" planes.A few minutes later, the Zeros fly over Chapman's boat. The Zeros suddenly execute sharp turns and open fire on the boat. Chapman, Scott and the yacht's other crewman all abandon ship, which explodes when the Zeros make another pass and again open fire. The pilots also strafe the survivors in the water, killing the crew member. The F14 pilots witness the attack but are given sharp orders not to engage the Zeros. At the urging of Yelland's XO, Dan Thurmond, the captain orders the F14 pilots to make a supersonic run over the Zeros in an attempt to frighten them off. The Zeros open fire on the Tomcats, and when radar shows the Zeros are on a course toward the Nimitz, Yellend orders the American pilots to open fire; both Zeros are easily downed: one pilot uses his plane's cannons, the other launches a missile. A helicopter is dispatched from the Nimitz to pick up Chapman, Scott and one of the Zero pilots who survived.Back on board the Nimitz the three survivors are sequestered belowdecks. Chapman, angry at being held against his will, is identified by Commander Owens. Owens determines that the storm that swallowed the Nimitz hours before has displaced the carrier in time and deposited them in the Pacific Ocean on December 6, 1941, one day before the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.Owens also shares the story of Chapman himself; just prior to the Japanese attack, Chapman and Scott were both declared lost at sea under unsolved circumstances. Chapman himself was considered to be a strong contender to beat Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency of the United States. By interfering with the attack on Chapman's yacht, the presence of the Nimitz has altered history and Chapman's survival may severely disrupt the space-time continuum. Yelland is, of course, opposed to simply executing the Senator and orders him held until they can figure out how best to deal with the disruption they've started.Another, larger question arises: should the Nimitz, presumably unable to return to its own time, and with armaments and aircraft two generations more advanced than anything in 1941, engage the Japanese fleet and air force and prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor? Dan Thurmond believes so while Lasky is torn by the idea, stating that this type of interference in history could have very serious consequences. Yelland grapples with the idea himself and determines that the Nimitz, bound by its loyalty to engage all enemies no matter the place or time, will participate in the battle.Meanwhile, the Japanese prisoner converses with Lt. Kajima, a Japanese-speaking member of the Nimitz' crew, and demands access to a radio to contact his own superiors. At one point, Chapman's Golden Retriever escapes from the room where his master is being held and runs into the room holding the Japanese pilot. The pilot is able to disarm a marine guard and seize his rifle, opening fire and killing a few crew members. He reiterates his demands through the translator and holds several people hostage, including Owens and Lasky. Owens is ordered by Yelland to tell the pilot that they are from the future, citing his knowledge of the names of the ships of the Japanese Imperial fleet nearby. The pilot is temporarily overwhelmed by the news and is distracted long enough for marines to move in and kill him.Yelland's intention of stopping the destruction of the American fleet at Pearl remains unchanged. As a safety precaution and the method best determined to restore the space-time continuum to normality, Chapman and Scott will be left on a nearby deserted island while the attack takes place. A helicopter takes them out, with Owens, to the island. Scott and Owens both jump out onto the sand, however Chapman seizes a flare pistol and demands to be flown back to Hawaii. A crew member tries to take the pistol, which goes off, causing the chopper to explode, killing Chapman and the crew. Owens and Scott are stranded.Back on the Nimitz, Yelland addresses his crew, telling them that they will engage the Japanese Air Force as they attack Pearl Harbor. However, just after the Nimitz' strike phalanx is launched, the same sort of storm that propelled the Nimitz through time appears again. Yelland aborts the counterattack and the ship is consumed again and delivered to the same spot and the same date and time where it was initially displaced. The aerial armada emerges from the storm intact and its aircraft safely land on the carrier.The Nimitz returns to Pearl Harbor and Lasky is met at the pier. The door of a nearby limousine opens and Scott's dog, still on the Nimitz when it was sent back into the future, excitedly runs to the limo and jumps inside. Lasky gets in the limo and sees both Laurel Scott and Commander Owens, both aged nearly 40 years. Owens tells Lasky that they ""have a lot to talk about."""

The Island,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080934/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A journalist takes his son with him to investigate pirate activity off the coast of Florida. But he gets stranded on a mysterious island--where he might not be alone. In New York City, journalist Blair Maynard convinces his editor to travel to Florida to investigate the mysterious disappearance of ships in the Bermuda Triangle area. Maynard is divorced, and his ex-wife sends their son Justin to stay with him while she is travelling with her boyfriend. Maynard brings Justin with him and promises to go to Walt Disney World with him. However, he tells Justin that they will travel to the Bermuda Triangle, but their plane crashes in an island. Maynard rents the boat of the local Dr. Brazil to fish barracuda with his son, but they are attacked by pirates and Maynard kills one of them in self-defense. They are captured and find that they are trapped in an island with pirates under the command of John David Nau. Maynard is forced to be the substitute for the husband of the widow Beth and Justin is brainwashed and converted into a pirate. Now Maynard tries to find a way off of the pirate island.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil David Warner leads a band of modern day pirates who raid yachts and sailboats of people on vacation out in the Caribbean. Sir Michael Caine is a reporter who goes out there with his son to investigate the mystery of the disappearing boats. He runs across Warner and his band of raiders and they decide to induct them into their tribe.—Humberto Amador A deep sea fishing boat docks for the night near a seemingly deserted, uncharted island. As the cabin boy, Manuel, serves drinks, a pirate appears and kills the men in gory fashion by axing them to death.Sometime later in New York City, reporter Blair Maynard (Michael Caine), a British-born journalist, convinces his editor to let him investigate the latest vessel missing in the ""Bermuda Triangle,"" claiming that 600 boats have vanished in that area in the last three years. In his office, Maynard is surprised to find his former wife has left their 10-year-old son, Justin (Jeffery Frank), with him for the weekend. Maynard cajoles the reluctant boy into traveling to Florida, promising a trip to Disneyland. However, when Maynard prioritizes the investigation first, Justin accuses him of backing out on another promise.Maynard and Justin arrive in Miami where Justin manipulates his father into taking him to a local purchasing a handgun for him. They stop at a local gun shop where the owner Mr. Baxter (William Schilling) demonstrates a Walther PPK semi-automatic pistol and after testing it at the gun shop's firing range, allows Mr. Maynard into buying it for Justin.Elsewhere, two sailboats stop near the island as night falls. During the night, pirates climb out of the water and attack the boats, killing everyone except for a young girl.The next day, Maynard and Justin visit the Miami docks and learn of the two additional missing boats, which set sail from the island of Navidad. A sailor theorizes that drug smuggling is involved and explains it is common in that part of the ocean. Maynard hires a rickety cargo plane to fly to Navidad, but the plane's wheels do not descend and they crash land. The pilot, Maynard, and Justin escape just before the plane explodes.Later, Justin wanders the beach as Maynard is directed to Windsor (Frank Middlemass), who rents boats. Windsor refuses Maynard's request to take him to the area, but changes his mind upon meeting Justin. The boy is excited to deep sea fish and catches a barracuda. As they head further out and near the island, they see a girl floating near a life raft. Justin reaches for her, but the girl (the same one the pirates captured) pulls him into the water and attempts to drown him. As Maynard moves to rescue his son, a pirate boards the boat and attacks. Maynard shoots and kills the pirate, but the body falls into Maynard, knocking him unconscious as he hits his head on a jagged nail.Maynard regains consciousness on the island at night where he and Justin are prisoners of a band of pirates. The pirates have, amazingly, remained undetected since the establishment of their pirate enclave by the notorious French buccaneer L'Olonnais in 1671. The pirates have a constitution of sorts, called the Covenant, and have a cruel but workable society. They raise any children they capture to ensure the survival of the colony, but kill anyone over the age of thirteen years. When the pirates' leader, Jean-David Nau (David Warner), learns Maynard's name, he declares Maynard's ancestors killed the pirate Blackbeard back in 1714 and therefore, the boy has ""good blood."" They take Justin away, informing Maynard that the boy is no longer his son. Beth (Angela Punch McGregor), the dead pirate's widow, demands Maynard's death, but Nau determines that she needs a man who can impregnate her, and Maynard is sentenced to that task. Meanwhile, Justin's eyes are pried open with twigs to keep him awake as the pirates rename him ""Tubar"" and brainwash the boy to reject his father and embrace their way of life.Several days later, Justin practices target shooting with Manuel, the former cabin boy who is now Nau's protégé. A gourd is placed in Maynard's hand and Justin shoots it, claiming he could have killed his father if he wanted to. Maynard claims people are searching for them, but Justin rejects his father and insists he is the pirate Tubar. Maynard is shackled and lead about by a chain, but glimpses the combination lock's packaging and gets the code.Late at night, as Beth sleeps, he unlocks his chains and sneaks outside. He sees Justin in another hut, being instructed in the pirates' history. Maynard runs to the beach and dives into the ocean to swim away, but is stung by a large jellyfish and forced to swim ashore. Beth finds him just before the others rush to the beach, and she claims they were bathing. The other pirates do not believe her, so they pull the jellyfish from the ocean and rub the stingers over her nude body as punishment.The next day, as Maynard works alongside Beth, he sees Windsor arrive in a boat. Beth chases Maynard as he runs to warn Windsor, but quickly learns the man is colluding with the pirates. A schooner approaches the island and, as the pirates prepare for battle, Windsor admits he reported Maynard and Justin as lost at sea, and reveals the pirates are an ""anthropologist's dream,"" having preserved their culture by living apart from the world for hundreds of years. However, the pirates' inbreeding has created numerous problems. They need Justin to carry on their leadership, and since Beth is the only fertile woman on the island, they require Maynard's genes to replenish their line.The pirates take Maynard and Justin with them and sail for the schooner. They board the ship, and the gory slaughter begins as the pirates kill all of the young crew and steal anything of value, except for the large supply of cocaine being smuggled inside. Maynard spots a flare gun and places it among Beth's loot. When one of the ship's occupants climbs a mast to escape, Nau hands Justin a gun and orders him to shoot. Justin kills the man before the pirates leave the schooner, blowing it up behind them.At the pirate camp back on the island, Beth finds the flare gun and tosses it aside, but Windsor takes it. Later, in the hut, Beth informs Maynard that she is pregnant. Maynard asks to be set free, but she declines, drags him outside, and demands that they be married. After the wedding vows, Nau declares that he is taking Justin as his son, instead of Manuel, as originally planned. Manuel is furious and leaves camp.Later, as Beth bathes, Manuel frees Maynard and offers to help him leave if he takes Justin with him to warn the outside world about the island. Maynard sneaks to the campfire where everyone is asleep, gags his son, and carries him to Manuel's boat, but when he sets Justin down, the boy runs screaming for Nau. Maynard sets sail, but Manuel had sabotaged the boat by drilling holes in the bottom and filling them with molasses and it sinks, forcing Maynard to swim back to shore.The next morning, Justin asks to lead the hunt for his father, and Nau agrees. As the others search the island, Nau and Windsor observe a US Coast Guard ship arriving offshore to investigate the multitude of cocaine packets floating free from the schooner's wreckage. As Windsor heads to intercept them, he discovers that Maynard spilled gunpowder across the deserted camp. Windsor grabs an ax, but Beth shoots him dead, allowing Maynard to light the gunpowder and destroy the camp along with some of the pirate women, but Beth survives. Seeing the explosion, the Coast Guard sends a boat to investigate, but the pirates attack the men killing them all.Maynard swims toward the Coast Guard ship as Nau, Justin, Manuel and the little girl don Coast Guard life vests and pretend to be the returning landing party. At the ship, a dozen or so pirates hidden in the boat climb aboard and quickly kill all of the crew in a matter of minutes. An officer relays a ""May Day"" message before he is shot dead. As the rest of the pirates from the island row out to the captured Coast Guard ship and begin to loot and other toss supplies from the ship into their boats, Maynard sneaks on board. He attempts to radio for help only to find the radio destroyed.Now driven mad with frustration and rage, Maynard climbs to the upper deck, discovers a .50 caliber heavy machine gun hidden under a tarp, and opens fire on the pirates scattered on the stern of the Coast Guard ship, ruthlessly slaughtering all of them in a hail of bullets. Nau, Justin, and Manuel hide on the aft deck as the rest of the pirates on deck and in their boats are all gunned down. When the machine gun is empty, Nau orders Justin to kill his father, but he cannot, so Manuel reaches for Justin's gun. As the boys struggle, Manuel is killed. Nau takes the gun and pulls Justin inside the ship, but Maynard finds a flare gun and follows where a climatic cat-and-mouse chase begins.As Nau shoots out the lights and binds Justin with ropes, Maynard fires a flare and sees Justin's location. The boy calls for his father as Nau attacks with a knife, and Maynard shoots a flare at the pirate leader, killing him at last. Maynard rushes to his son as a Coast Guard rescue helicopter arrives on the scene as night begins to fall and the pilot radios the ship's location and of the island as the end credits roll."

Raise the Titanic,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081400/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Once they said God himself couldn't sink her. Then they said no man on Earth could reach her. But an underwater research agency, headed by Admiral James Sandecker, is assigned the job of finding the doomed ship in her North Atlantic grave. A group of Americans are interested in raising the ill-fated ocean liner Titanic from its watery grave. One of them finds out the Russians also have plans to do so. Why all the interest? A rare mineral on board could be used to power a sound beam that will knock any missile out of the air while entering US airspace.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> Join the underwater race to salvage the Titanic and its vital defense cargo. Adapted fromClive Cussler's international bestseller, the story follows the exploits of American special agent Dirk Pitt as he sets out to recover a vital, rare material from the Titanic which could make the US impregnable to atomic attack. The ship is down too deep for divers and the only solution is to raise it. The incredible project must be managed in absolute secrecy because of deadly interference from a rival nation. The Titanic is finally, and majestically, brought to the surface, but the mineral is missing. The American military has a experimental defense system that requires an extremely rare mineral in order to work. Investigations prove that the only known source of it is in the Soviet Union, but it is known that around the turn of the century a miner exported some of it. Hopes are dashed when it is learned that he transported it aboard the Titanic. But perhaps the ship can be salvaged.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> The film opens on the fictional island of Svardlov in the far North Sea above the Soviet Union in the year 1982 where an American spy breaks into an old mine where he discovers the frozen body of a US Army sergeant and mining expert, named Jake Hobart. Next to the frozen corpse is a newspaper from 1912, as well as some mining tools from the early part of the 20th century. Using a radiation meter, the spy discovers that what he seeks: an extremely rare mineral named byzanium, was there in the mine but had been mined out leaving only radioactive traces. He is then chased and shot by Soviet forces but rescued at the last moment by Dirk Pitt (Richard Jordan), a former U.S. Navy officer and a clandestine CIA operator.Back in Washington DC, it is explained by government scientist Gene Seagram (David Selby) and the head of The National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA, a NASA-like agency for sea exploration) Admiral James Sandecker (Jason Robards) that the mineral their man was trying to find is needed to fuel a powerful new defense system, code-named ""The Sicilian Project"". This system, using laser technology, would be able to destroy any incoming nuclear missiles during an attack and ""make nuclear war obsolete"".The CIA and Pitt soon find out that boxes of the raw mineral were loaded onto the Belfast-built RMS Titanic by an American, named Brewster, in April 1912. A search is then conducted in the North Atlantic to locate the sunken ocean liner. The search team is aided by one of the Titanic's last survivors John Bigalow (Alec Guinness), who was a teenage seaman on board, who explains he was also the last person to see Brewster alive. Just minutes before the Titanic foundered, Bigalow said he locked the man inside the ship's vault containing the boxes of mineral, his last words being ""thank God for Southby!"" At this point it is decided that the only way to get a hold of the byzanium is to literally ""raise the Titanic"" from the ocean floor. Pitt comes up with a salvage plan that Sandecker presents to the president. The President signs off on the plan and Pitt is put in charge of the operation.At this time the Soviet KGB station chief in Washington D.C., Andre Prevlov (Bo Brundin), is receiving bits of information on the project and leaks them to a reporter, Dana Archibald (Anne Archer), who is also Seagram's lover as well as a former girlfriend of Pitt's. The story blows the project's secret cover and Sandecker must hold a press conference to explain why the ship is being raised. Questions are raised about byzanium, but are not answered.After a lengthy search, the Titanic is located and the search team, with help from the U.S. Navy, begins the dangerous job of raising the ship from the seabed. One of the submersibles, Starfish, experiences a cabin flood and implodes. Another submersible, the Deep Quest, is attempting to clear debris from one of the upper decks when it suddenly tears free of its supports, crashes through the skylight above the main staircase and becomes jammed. Pitt decides they must attempt to raise the ship before the Deep Quest crew suffocates.Eventually, the rusting Titanic is brought to the surface by using explosives to break the hull loose from the bottom suction and compressed air tanks to fill buoyancy aids. During the ascent, the Deep Quest safely breaks away from the ship.When Prevlov, who has been aboard a nearby Soviet spy ship, sees the Titanic, he arranges a fake distress call to draw the American naval escorts away from the operation. He then meets with Sandecker, Pitt and Seagram aboard their vessel. He tells them that his government knows all about the mineral and challenges them for both salvage of the Titanic as well as ownership of ore, claiming it was illegally taken from Russian soil. Prevlov says that if there is to be a ""superior weapon"" made from the mineral, then ""Russia must have it!"" Sandecker tells Prevlov they knew he was coming and what he would threaten them with. Pitt then escorts him to the deck where U.S. fighter jets and a nuclear attack submarine have arrived to protect the Titanic from their attempted piracy. Prevlov leaves in defeat.The ship is then towed into New York City harbor and moored at the old White Star Line dock, its original intended destination. The arrival is greeted with much fanfare including huge cheering crowds, the international media, escorting ships, and aircraft. On entering the watertight vault, the salvage team discovers the mummified remains of the American, Mr. Brewster, but no mineral. Instead, they find only boxes of gravel. As they contemplate their probable failure, Sandecker tells Pitt and Seagram that in addition to powering the defensive system, they were actually thinking of a way to weaponize the byzanium and create a super bomb, which went against everything the scientist believed in. As Pitt listens, he goes through the belongings of the dead Brewster found in the vault and finds an un-mailed postcard. He then realizes that there was a clue in those final words, ""Thank God for Southby"". The postcard shows a church and graveyard in the small village of Southby on the English coast, the place Brewster had arranged a fake burial for the frozen miner Jake Hobart prior to sailing back to the United States on the Titanic.In the final scene, Pitt and Seagram travel to England and go alone to the small graveyard just three miles from Southampton and find the grave of Jake Hobart. Through their radiation detectors, they discover that the byzanium had indeed been buried there after all... and has been there for the past 70 years by Brewster while apparently evading Russian spies that killed off his entire team. Aparently Brewster buried the byzanium ore in an empty coffin and used the late Jake Hobart's name as a cover. After thinking about it, Seagram and Pitt decide to leave the mineral in the grave because they agree its existence would destabilize the status quo that maintains the peace between the West and the Soviet Union."
Prom Night,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081383/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"At a high school senior prom, a masked killer stalks four teenagers who were responsible for the accidental death of a classmate six years previously.

While going to school, the siblings Kim, Alex and Robin stop nearby the building since Kim needs to return home. Robin flees from Alex and runs to the building, and the quartet frightens her and she falls off the window, immediately dying. They promise to each other to keep secret about what have just happened to Robin. Six years later, on the prom night, the serial-killer Leonard Murch, who is the suspect of murdering Robin, escapes from the mental institution where he is interned and the police is afraid that he returns to town to seek revenge. When Murch is captured by the police in another town, Lt. McBride feels relieved and resolve to enjoy the prom.

Young Kim and her two twin siblings, Alex and Robin, walk by and see the children playing. Kim and Alex leave, but Robin lingers, hoping to join the game. But upon entering the building, the four kids gang up on her, chanting ""kill!"" until Robin has nowhere to go. Backing up into a window, Robin crashes through and falls out of a second floor to her death below. One of the kids, Nick, wants to get help, but Wendy convinces all of them that the best thing to do is tell no one and never tell anyone about what happened. Wendy, Nick, Jude, and Kelly swear to keep quiet. As they leave the building and ride away on their bicycles, an unseen person sees them ride off. Later that evening, Robin's father, Mr. Hammond (Leslie Nielsen) and the police are at the scene. They have surmised that Robin was the victim of a sexual attack by a homicidal maniac. They think they know who is responsible and the cops go off to question a suspect.Six years later.The now grown-up Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Alex (Michael Tough) are visiting their sister's grave with their parents. A little later, an unseen person with a creaky voice is telephoning each member of the guilty party one by one telling them, ""I'll see you at the prom!"" The timid Kelly is upset, while Jude and Wendy think that it's a prank.Meanwhile, Nick's father, Detective McBride (George Touliatos), is unsettled because a psycho killer named Leonard Murch has escaped from a local clinic hospital. Murch was an ex-convict and known sex offender/pedophile who the police (mistakenly) suspected was responsible for Robin's death. That night when McBride and his men approached Murch at his apartment for questioning, he climbed out a back window of his apartment and fled before they could ask him any questions. Murch led the police on a high speed car chase through the town which ended when his car slid off the road resulting in it getting wrecked and exploding in a mass of flames. Murch suffered horrible burns all over his body and has been residing in the asylum for the criminal insane after he was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial for Robin's murder. McBride suspects that Murch may want to head back to the town where it happened to look for more victims. When the police discover the dead body of a nurse that Murch took as a hostage during his escape from the hospital, McBride and the asylum psychiatrist Dr. Fairchild believe that Murch may have returned to the town for revenge against everyone.In town, it is revealed that Nick is Kim's latest boyfriend. Wendy is Nick's ex-girlfriend, and she is certainly not happy that the new couple are going to their senior prom together. Wendy tries to assure Kim that the relationship will not last by telling her ""It's not who you go with. It's who takes you home"". Later, the school bully and misfit Lou (David Mucci), is messing with Kim in the cafeteria wearing a mouth-less ski mask. Alex steps in to defend his sister, and he holds his own against Lou's two pals until Lou sucker punches him in the back. Brought before the principal, whom is Mr. Hammond, he suspends Lou for fighting. As Lou leaves the school grounds, Wendy tries to talk to him. When Nick and Kim are walking around, Nick tries to tell her about that fateful day, but is he not able to.Meanwhile, Wendy makes devious plans to break up Kim and Nick, and she tells Lou that she doesn't want anyone hurt. Lou tells her that he will take care of it. Nearby, Jude is picked up for a ride home by Slick, an outcast student who drives a Chevy van, whom he asks her to the prom and she accepts. In the girls locker room after tennis practice, Wendy finds her school photograph torn from the yearbook and hanging on the front of her locker. When Kim and her friend, Kelly, are alone, they hear a loud noise in the locker room and they see that a mirror has been smashed. After checking around the locker room, the return to see that a fragment of the mirror is gone. Jude and Kelly both find their yearbook photographs inside their lockers, as does Nick.That night, Lou picks up Wendy to take her to the prom. Mr. Hammond is the chaperone and Alex is the DJ for the disco music. Everyone is having a good time dancing and listening to the music and watch Kim and Nick do their well-choreographed dance on the dance floor before everyone. Detective McBride secretly arrives at the dance to oversee it and to make sure that nothing bad happens.Kelly and her boyfriend, Drew, leave the gymnasium for a part of the school in a locker room where they begin to make out. Kelly decides that she cannot go any further, and an irate Drew goes elsewhere telling Kelly that he knows ""plenty who will"". After Drew walks out on Kelly, an unidentified figure donning the ski mask and wearing all-black clothing stealthily approaches the tearful Kelly and kills her by slitting her throat with a mirror shard.Jude and Slick decide to sneak out of the festivities in the gym for some intimate time as well. Outside, Jude and Slick are in the back of his van enjoying the privacy. After spending a bit of time outside the van, they hear noises and thinking that someone is nearby spying on them, go back inside the vehicle to smoke some marijuana. After a minute, the back doors open and the masked killer stabs Jude's neck with the mirror shard. The murderer then leaps in after Slick who fights back and pushes the killer out of his van and starts it up to run the killer over. The killer leaps out of the way and grabs onto Slick as he is trying to drive away. After wildly spinning around, the killer jumps free and the van with Slick inside goes over a cliff and explodes.The killer returns to the school, now wielding a felling axe and follows Wendy out of the gym to the ladies room where she is putting on makeup. The lights are turned off and the killer attacks her. Wendy gets away and a long chase through the school begins as Wendy tries to outrun her axe-wielding pursuer. The chase leads through the darkened halls, classrooms, and the workshop area. Wendy almost gets away, but in due time the killer finds her when she screams to the discovery of Kelly's body in a linen closet and she is axed to her death.Back inside the prom, McBride is told by another police officer that Murch has been caught and was several miles away from the town.

"Oh, God! Book II",1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081268/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"God asks a young girl to help spread his word and influence with a slogan. Second ""Oh, God!"" movie has God appearing before eleven-year-old Tracy Richards to ask for her help to spread his word and influence over the world which she suggests the slogan ""Think God"". Naturaly, Tracy's divorced parents Paula and Don think Tracy's just crazy and plot to halt her ""heaven-sent"" mission to spread God's word.—matt-282 Young Tracy Richards (Louanne) and her neighbor, Shingo (John Louie), shoot basketballs until Tracy's divorced father, Don Richards (David Birney), arrives in his red Jeep to take her on an outing. Don's ex-wife and Tracy's mother Paula (Suzanne Pleshette), tells Don to have Tracy back at a regular time.As father and daughter eat Chinese food, Don complains about the plot from a science-fiction movie they saw, but Tracy talks about the importance of believing in supernatural things. As Don leaves to make a phone call, Tracy opens a fortune cookie that reads: "" Meet me in the lounge. - God."" A second fortune cookie says, ""I mean you, Tracy. - God.""In the lounge, a man's voice beckons her through a red lacquer door, introduces himself as God, and asks for help. At first, Tracy thinks her father is playing tricks, but when other people cannot hear God's voice, she is convinced. God also says he was impressed when she talked about the importance of believing things that cannot be seen. Then, the voice goes silent.On the ride home, Tracy says she had a daydream although vague on the details, but Don, an advertising art director, assures her that it happens to people all the time. He then leaves her in the parked car while retrieving work from his office. This time, God appears in the backseat as an elderly man (George Burns) wearing a gray jacket, black-rimmed glasses, and a red shirt. When Tracy said she expected a deity to wear a crown and a flowing robe, God tells her she has confused him with the actor Charlton Heston. God complains that people do not believe in him anymore, so Tracy suggests that he needs an advertising slogan to spread his message. He asks her to create one that children will understand. Later, Don gives Tracy some pointers on ways to devise a slogan.Back at home, Tracy asks Rosa (Alma Beltran), the housekeeper, if she talks to God. Rosa admits to praying everyday, but says that Tracy's imagination is running wild when Tracy confesses to her experience with God. Later, Tracy tells Shingo about her adventure with God, but he does not believe her either. When Tracy angrily throws a basketball at the hoop and makes a perfect shot, Shingo wonders if she is telling the truth.At school, Tracy's teacher, Miss Hudson, accuses her of being inattentive in class and not turning in her homework, but Tracy is unable to explain her lack of interest. Back at home, Tracy studies television commercials obsessively, trying to figure out an appropriate slogan for God. As she watches The Johnny Carson Show, God appears on the television, and then, suddenly materializes in Tracy's living room. After listening to Tracy's material, God gives the girl another week to create a winning slogan. He encourages her to bounce ideas off of Shingo, with whom she and he eventually come up with ""Think God.""At a local McDonalds the next day, Tracy presents the slogan to God, he tells her the next step is to spread the word. Tracy is worried that the extra responsibility will make her fall farther behind in her schoolwork, but God is persuasive. Tracy rallies her schoolmates, who post signs and leave chalk messages all over town. However, Paula Richards confronts her daughter after receiving a letter from Miss Hudson. When Tracy explains that God has visited her, Paula does not believe her. Tracy is pressured to catch up on her schoolwork, while Shingo enlists his cousins to help spread the word.Later, Tracy complains to God that spreading his slogan has gotten her in trouble with both her parents and friends, and he soothes her by finishing her math homework.Another time later, Don and Paula question their daughter, but Tracy sticks to her story about God. Don wants Tracy to see a psychiatrist or a minister, but Paula wants to handle Tracy's situation by herself without outside interference. The parents decide to watch Tracy's behavior for a few more days.Back at school, the principal, Mr. Benson, arranges a meeting with the Richards because Tracy refuses to stop her God campaign. When Paula tells her daughter that she will be expelled from school if she continues, Tracy says she will stop on the condition that God agrees to the plan. When the school psychologist learns that Tracy's relationship with God started in a Chinese restaurant with a fortune cookie, the principal suspends Tracy and the psychologist tells the parents their daughter needs professional help.Meanwhile, Tracy's school friends picket in front of the school for Tracy's return. Soon, Don and Paula take Tracy to see Dr. Jerome Newell (Anthony Holland) who examines Tracy and puts her through a series of psychosis tests. After the tests are done, Dr. Newell tells Don and Paula that he theorizes (wrongly) that Tracy has created a ""fantasy father figure"" as a substitute for her real father, whom she sees on a limited basis since her parents' divorce. Dr. Newell concludes that there is nothing medically wrong with Tracy, but she is suffering from a psychosis. He suggests that she enter a mental treatment facility in Santa Barbara, California. Before Tracy is taken away to be admitted, she searches for God in several churches and even a synagogue, but cannot find him.Tracy decides to run away, and Shingo helps her hide at his grandparents' house. Later, Tracy runs away to Union Train Station after Shingo warns her that he had to reveal her whereabouts when Don confronted and threatened him. There, God finally appears and convinces Tracy that running away is not the answer, and drives her home in a motorcycle sidecar. Two policemen see the motorcycle (with no one riding it) and chase after it, but God manages to loose the policemen. When Tracy's parents find their daughter in bed, Tracy explains that God brought her home.Meanwhile, the news reports that Tracy's slogan has spread internationally. In court, a judge asks that a panel of psychiatrists convene to determine Tracy's mental health. Based on their findings, the judge says he will rule on whether or not Tracy goes back to school. As the doctors' panel rules that Tracy can start treatment, God arrives and introduces himself as Dr. Stevens, a psychiatrist. Demonstrating his supernatural power, God makes a chandelier disappear and reappear, and turns day into night. He then turns to leave and vanishes; only the door opens and closes by itself. The panel is left speechless, so the Richards take their daughter home.Tracy and her family celebrate at the Chinese restaurant. Tracy receives a message from the fortune cookies and goes to the lounge. There, God thanks her and her friends for their wonderful campaign. Although Tracy is sad she may never see God again, he promises to call on her if he needs help with a big problem."
The Competition,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080556/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Paul Dietrich, at almost 30 years old, is a fading piano prodigy. Heidi Schoonover is a talented young pianist with a promising future. When Paul hears of an upcoming competition that could make his career, he dedicates himself to winning. The movie centers on a piano competition whose winner is assured of success. It is Paul's last chance to compete, but newcomer Heidi may be a better pianist. Can romance be far away? Will she take a dive despite the pressure to win from her teacher, Greta, or will she condemn Paul to obscurity?—Reid Gagle Paul Dietrich (Richard Dreyfuss) sits in a budget hotel room ahead of a wake-up call from the front desk, preparing for a piano competition in Cincinnati. He showers and changes into a formal suit to perform at a small event in a cramped auditorium. After he places third, he feels there is no point in competing further: he tells his parents that he has applied for a teaching position in the public school system. His father Stan (Philip Sterling) has continued to work against doctor's orders to support Paul's career, but Stan feels Paul has a talent he needs to continue to develop. Paul visits the school where he would teach, and sees his friend Gary (Howard Osias) trying to teach a class of beginners how to play octaves, and the experience discourages him. Returning home, his mother (Gloria Strook) is shocked when he tells her that he wants to take one last shot at competing before he attends the interview for the job.Meanwhile, world-class pianist turned teacher Greta Vandemann (Lee Remick) introduces her protégé Heidi Joan Schoonover (Amy Irving) to the idea of entering her first piano competition: the Arabella Hillman Competition in San Francisco, offering a $20,000 grand prize, two years of concert bookings (including a Carnegie Hall recital) and a medal. Since Heidi has never hinted that she is ready to start competing, Greta has submitted an audition tape in which she has imitated Heidi's style, and the ruse has earned Heidi a spot among 12 semifinalists.On the plane to San Francisco, Heidi works on a concerto by studying the fingering on her seat tray. Paul drives to the competition from Chicago and takes a room in a budget motel for the week. At the Soviet Consulate, aides are escorting a Russian piano teacher, Madame Gorshev (Bea Silvern) and her student Tatiana Boronova (Vicki Kriegler)--who is a semifinalist-- to their private suite on the grounds. The woman is edgy but tries to put Tatiana, who speaks no English, at ease.At the concert hall entrance, Heidi meets hunky semifinalist Girolamo ""Jerry"" DiSalvo (Joseph Cali) from the Bronx. He tries to attach himself to her, and when she politely declines, he tags along with the next semifinalist to arrive: Mitzi (Elaine Welton Hill), telling her he discovered his piano talent while at the house of corrections. Inside the building, Heidi is pleased to see Paul, with whom she had played a piano duet at Tanglewood years before, but Paul seems to show little interest in her. Paul excuses himself to use the restroom and spends a few seconds there reminding himself--addressing his image in the mirror--that the girl everybody called Joanie might eat into his concentration on the competition. The pianists rehearse for the semifinals. Mark Landau (Adam Stern) from Canada boots Mitzi from a rehearsal room in the concert hall and tunes the piano with his own supplies before he practices. Michael Humphries (Ty Henderson), a former Delaware resident living in Italy, has a piano in a swank hotel room and practices in the nude. At the consulate, Tatiana is frustrated while rehearsing a difficult passage in her concerto and storms away while her teacher scolds her. On the day of the semifinals, Heidi greets Paul again and, when he ignores her, she says that he should show some familiarity with her since they did play together and attended each others recitals. He responds by discussing the competition, and she leaves disappointed.Paul plays brilliantly at the semifinal, while Mitzi attempts to distract the judges from her piano playing with her choice of dress, to Michael's amusement. Tatiana manages a smooth performance with her teacher and consulate aides seated in the audience. Principal conductor Andrew Erskine (Sam Wanamaker) announces that Tatiana, Paul, Michael, Jerry, Mark and Heidi have become the finalists.Erskine has the finalists select their order of play from random slips of paper and instructs them to choose from one of four pianos available to play their selected concerto. When he leaves, Paul asks for everybody's number and finds that not only has he drawn the last spot, but he and Jerry are planning to play the same Saint-Saens concerto. Paul convinces Jerry to swap numbers so Paul will play second and relinquish Saint-Saens to Jerry in favor of Beethoven's 5th piano concerto, ""The Emperor."" Jerry shows Heidi a newspaper article in which he told the press he was in trouble as a kid, including an untrue reference to reform school. Mrs. DiSalvo (Delia Salvi) yells at Jerry for not earning respect with his playing, but he explains that Tatiana is getting the most publicity and he wants to be visible, too .At the hotel, Greta surprises Heidi by showing up in the lobby to help her through the finals; Greta's own teacher has loaned them her private residence in San Francisco for the duration of their stay. As they settle in, Greta explains to Heidi that modern concert pianists must start performing younger than before, and she wants to protect her student. Later, while Heidi is selecting her piano at the concert hall, she finds that her favorite is not properly tuned, but when Paul enters early, she accepts the secretary's assurance that it will be ready for the event. Paul is rude to the secretary while he selects his instrument, but is more receptive to Heidi's presence and explains to her that he feels the need to keep blinders on while he competes. She tells him she thinks it is nice that Paul's parents have traveled to San Francisco to see him in the finals. She also confesses that every time she sees him, she wants to either cry or smack him around. Though this admission stirs Paul, he leaves without settling their conflict.During the rehearsal with the orchestra, Paul brings up an issue with Erskine about the concerto, and says he thinks there is a better approach to the rondo portion, which he has figured out while studying it. Erskine is miffed--he has conducted the piece 200 times, while Paul has played it six times-- and calls Paul out to prove his point. Paul astounds the orchestra with simple instructions to the strings and a call for more emphasis at one portion, and then he conducts them through the segment. Erskine concedes, calls for a break and leaves, and the orchestra members acknowledge Paul with applause.As Tatiana and Madame Gorshev go on an outing, the teacher asks the consulate car driver to pull over next to a music shop; she gets out but glances about nervously, then suddenly runs to an approaching vehicle and jumps in as it pulls off. The aides must restrain and eventually sedate a hysterical Tatiana, and chaos ensues back in the consulate at the apparent defection. The state department representative involves Erskine in the situation, as Tatiana cannot compete for at least a week. The staff picks up the finalists' expenses during the delay in the finals, but an enraged Paul says that time means more to him than to the others. Paul sees his parents off on a courtesy shuttle to the airport, but not before he talks seriously with his mother about the job and the fact that his father is certain to die soon if he doesn't stop exerting himself.Greta has Heidi working on Prokofiev's second piano concerto, saying she should have another piece handy because her career may call for it. Paul arrives at the apartment, and Heidi dishes out some of the aloofness Paul had given her. He apologizes for being rude, offering to do anything she would like. She asks Paul for a driving lesson, since her practicing has taken up the time she would have spent learning how to drive. Greta is not pleased with the new relationship. Paul turns out to be a patient and calm driving instructor, and Heidi is amazed that he could be so cold behind the piano; he says it is the same person. They stop for dinner, make an awkward attempt at dancing and realize that they do not have ordinary lives, but they begin to warm to each other. The night ends in Paul's hotel room where Heidi intends for them to be close without getting involved in sex. Paul confesses that he hated the prospect of ending up like Gary, teaching disinterested children, while Heidi tells Paul that she originally was a cellist, but the cello tickled her nose. She advises him to let his parents love him by supporting his career. They end up in each others arms making love.The state department rep visits Erskine at the conductor's apartment, and is surprised to find Mitzi there. Erskine helps him arrange for a secret meeting for Madame Gorshev to explain to Tatiana why she left her and avoid any bad publicity for either country.Heidi and Paul rehearse her concerto as a duet in the apartment, but Heidi plays a joke on Paul and turns it into a two-person rendition of everyman's piano composition, ""Heart and Soul."" Greta returns and, after Paul leaves, she admonishes Heidi for not using competitive edge to distance herself from her opposition. She also reminds Heidi that there is always somebody in the business like Paul, and a relationship like the one they have can be an emotional drain. Heidi disagrees, but learns that Greta speaks from experience, though she refuses to elaborate. Meanwhile, Paul calls his friend Gary and asks him to withdraw the job application, saying he doesn't want to hedge his bets by having something to fall back upon.At the press reception for the finalists, camera crews swarm around Tatiana as she rejoins the competition. Paul is furious and tears out of the hotel in his car with Heidi. They stop at the wharf and Paul tells Heidi that the contest has become a vehicle for Tatiana and nobody else has a chance of winning. As they walk along the dock, three French sailors ogle Heidi and a frustrated Paul picks a fight with them; Heidi makes an excuse for his behavior using her limited command of French and saves them both. He storms off and she follows, hollering at him for not watching out for her. Paul shuts down, saying that they have no relationship and nothing other than the competition matters to him; an upset Heidi leaves in a cab.At the finals, Mark Landau performs and Paul plays his last competitive concerto with Erskine leading the orchestra under Paul's vision of the rondo. Heidi watches from the audience in a heartsick daze, confounding Greta. Tatiana finishes the evening with a tense performance.Later that evening, Heidi considers pulling out of the finals, as it means so much to Paul that he wins. Greta tries to refocus her student by telling her that she will be older and more desperate to win like Paul someday, and a man would not pull out of an event for her. Heidi thinks Paul can play better than she can, but Greta will not discuss her chances of winning against Paul.The next morning, Paul visits the apartment to apologize, only to find that Heidi has left and Greta does not know where she is. She tells Paul he has done well in getting rid of the only competitor he truly has. He leaves and finds Heidi watching an acting troupe outside the concert hall and tells her not to pull out thinking she is doing him any favors because he is not afraid of her. He then realizes what he is doing is alienating them both, and he confesses that now he realizes how important she is, compared to the competition. They decide to consider themselves a corporation in which either of them can win.Michael performs, and then Paul supports Heidi from backstage as she prepares for her performance. Onstage she begins her Mozart concerto only to find that an important key on the piano she selected has gone bad and she stops seconds into the performance. Erskine tells her not to panic while they get another piano. She decides to change concerti and play the Prokofiev, which Erskine rejects until Greta appears. With Paul lending his support they spar for her right to change concerti, and when Greta loses her temper and makes a mildly insulting remark to Erskine the tension breaks and he relents. As Heidi begins again with the Prokofiev, Paul realizes that she is far more talented, and he listens in amazement as she performs the difficult piece unrehearsed and with feeling and precision. Paul goes for a walk outside the concert hall to clear his mind, and he returns to join Greta backstage. Jerry plays his Saint-Saens to finish the event.The judges decide the winners with little delay; Michael Humphries earns the bronze medal and $2500, and when Paul becomes the $5000 silver medalist, he and Heidi lock eyes but neither can see their true emotions. Erskine then announces the winner of the competition is Heidi. Greta disappears out the stage door and has a private moment of unbridled exultation.Backstage Heidi gets Paul alone and begins discussing their corporation and plans, but then she realizes that he is not sharing her enthusiasm. He tells her levelly that she is going to have a great launching of her career as a world-class pianist. When she tries to bring up his position of power as a silver medalist he scoffs, telling her to revel in her victory and that some things cannot be shared. He admits he had never considered that she could play better than he could, and that he is not sure he can handle their relationship in that way. He tells her he plans to join the party at Michael's apartment after he calls his parents, but she tells him she knows he will walk out on her. He leaves, calls his mother and tells her the results were fair, then checks out of the motel.At the party, Heidi sulks away from the others, and Greta comes over to tell her that she will eventually find the perfect man, encouraging her to go to the dance floor and join who is available. She again attempts to dance but feels empty until she looks up and sees Paul has arrived. After a few silent, awkward moments, they reconnect and begin to dance together."
Wholly Moses!,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081751/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An all-star comedy cast hams it up in this hilarious Biblical spoof. Harvey and Zoey, two tourists travelling through Israel, discover an ancient scroll describing the life of Herschel, the man who was almost Moses. Herschel receives the command from God to free his people from Egyptian slavery, but Moses keeps blundering by and taking all the credit. Several other biblical stories, such as Lot and his wife, David and Goliath, and the miracles of Jesus, are also parodied in this story of the life of a man trying to follow the path to God, but somehow always seeming to lose his way.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>"
The Last Flight of Noah's Ark,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081031/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a plane carrying various animals makes a forced landing on a desert island, the only chance to escape is to convert the plane into a boat. When Noah Dugan agrees to fly missionary Bernadette Lafleur and her cargo of animals to a remote island, its only because he is on the run from a couple of bookies. What neither of them know is that two of Miss Lafleur's young students have stowed away with the animals & Miss Lafleur's transistor radio has interfered with the plane's instruments and they're all now miles off course. After a forced landing on a remote island, Dugan, Bernadette, Bobby and Julie discover that they are not alone. Together with two Japanese soldiers who have been stranded on the island since WWII, they must turn the plane into a seaworthy boat if they are ever to make it home. When Bobby and Julie insist that they cannot leave the animals behind, the converted plane truly becomes a second Noah's Ark—April M. Cheek <Aravis2713@aol.com> Pilot Noah Dugan is sleeping when two creditors burst in and threaten him. They tell him he has 24 hours to come up with $5,000 and a week to come up with an unspecified remainder. They rough him up and leave.Dugan goes out looking for work, but nobody will hire him. In desperation, he goes to a friend, Stoney, who tells him about a cargo run. Dugan asks what kind of plane. Stoney is evasive at first, then finally shows him the plane -- an old B-29 into which animals are being loaded. Dugan refuses, saying animals and planes don't mix. Trying to convince Dugan to fly the run, Stoney introduces him to Bernadette LaFleur, a missionary with an orphanage who is taking the animals to a remote tropical island, where she plans to show the natives how to raise them. Bernadette asks how soon they can leave. Dugan says never, and tells her to get her money back from Stoney -- fast. Stoney says the money is gone. Bernadette threatens to take the matter to the police if necessary.Dugan finally tells Stoney he'll take the run if he gets a certified check for $3,000 in Honolulu. As Dugan explores the plane, Petey, a duck belonging to Julie, one of the orphans, escapes to the back of the plane. Dugan goes after him and ends up dropping out the back. Seeing the plane's condition, Dugan heads off, but stops short when he sees the creditors drive up. Saying he'll fly the cargo run, Dugan asks Stoney to stall them.The kids load the rest of the animals, among them a bull, Brutus. Dugan has trouble getting Brutus on the plane until Bobby, another of the kids, coaxes him on board. Dugan has the kids leave, while Julie and Bobby stay behind to say goodbye to Petey and Brutus, respectively. Evading the creditors, Dugan packs his bags. Bernadette says goodbye to Julie and Bobby and she and Dugan head for the plane. Once on board, Dugan starts the engines. Uneasy about how Dugan will treat the animals, Bobby sneaks on board. Julie follows him.As Dugan takes off, he lights a cigar while Bernadette plays classical music in a tape player. Dugan complains about the music, and Bernadette, who he calls ""Bernie,"" says she'll let stop playing the music if he stops smoking. Dugan reluctantly agrees, then discovers that the plane's autopilot isn't working. Bernie offers to help, but Dugan is doubtful since her experience is limited to a few hours flying a Cessna. As soon as she takes control, however, the plane pitches nose down. Just then, Petey comes out, followed by the kids. Dugan goes back with the kids to check on the animals, but is knocked unconscious when Brutus kicks him.The kids report the problem to Bernie, but just then Dugan returns. He settles in to fly the plane through the rest of the night while the kids sleep in the back. The next morning, Bernie and Dugan see the sunrise off the left wing, not behind them as expected. Dugan checks the instruments, which indicate that they're still on the heading he wanted to fly. When he removes Bernie's tape player, however, he discovers that the player had affected the compass and they're now off course. He says they'll have to go as far as they can before they run out of fuel. Bernie asks if they can turn back, but Dugan says they've gone too far.As the engines begin to flame out, Bobby spots an island off to the left. The engines die out completely just before they reach the island, forcing Dugan to ditch in the water, with the plane coming to a sudden stop on the beach. Dugan and Bernie build a corral out of the vegetation and move the animals from the plane into the corral. Meanwhile, two Japanese sailors, who noticed the plane when it crashed, begin making plans to intercept the new arrivals.As Bobby leads Brutus to the corral, he suddenly runs off. Bobby and Julie chase after him, finally catching up to him near a river. When they make their way back, they see the Japanese sailors' hut and tell Dugan and Bernie. Dugan says the hut must have been a World War II military outpost. Bernie says the sailors look like they're still dressed for the war. Dugan says they may not have heard that it ended. Bernie suggests going down and talking to them, but Dugan vetoes the idea, saying they should go back to the plane instead.Back in the plane, the group sees the two sailors come out. The sailors demand that the group surrender, but both their rifles malfunction and a grenade that one of them throws turns out to be a dud. Dugan, Bernie, Bobby, and Julie chase them back into the underbrush. Bernie says she still wants to make friends with them, but Dugan still doesn't trust them.As Julie and Bobby prepare for bed, Julie says that Dugan was brave, but Bobby says he still doesn't like him. Bernie goes to relieve Dugan, apologizing for her behavior. Dugan also apologizes. Bernie says she'd like for them to try to get along better.The next morning, Bernie is nowhere to be found, so Dugan goes after her while the kids go swimming. Bernie makes her way to the sailors' camp, finding it empty. As she explores their hut, they return. She tells them that World War II is over. They settle down and prepare a meal, which they share with her. Meanwhile, Dugan comes across the compound. When he overhears Bernie saying, ""No more, I've had enough,"" and hears the soldiers laughing, he charges the hut, breaking a wall and upsetting the meal. The soldiers attack Dugan, but Bernie shouts at them to stop. She introduces her friends to Dugan as Commander Hiro and Cleveland from the Japanese Navy. Cleveland, who is fluent in English, says that his mom visited the United States in 1924 and her favorite city was Cleveland, his namesake. Bernie says the sailors have been stranded on the island for 35 years.As Bernie and Dugan make their way back to the plane, he lectures her for leaving. Later that night, while the kids are sleeping, he tries to apologize to her. When she doesn't listen, he asks more forcefully and they go outside to talk. Meanwhile, not having actually fallen asleep, Bobby and Julie sneak to the front of the plane and overhear them talking. Dugan tells Bernie he cares about her and they share a kiss. Bobby asks Julie how Bernie can like Dugan, and she says Dugan is really nice. Bobby remains unconvinced.The next day, the sailors see the group attempting to drag a rubber fuel tank from the plane. Cleveland says the tank will make a lousy raft, and Hiro comes up with an idea to use the plane as a boat. Bobby likes the idea, but Dugan has his doubts. Cleveland asks him if he plans to stay until someone finds him, and he says he will, even if it's a couple of days or weeks. Cleveland then asks him, ""How about 35 years?""With the sailors' help, Dugan, Bernie, Bobby, and Julie change the plane into a boat. Bernie works on a sail, but when she asks for a large piece of cloth to put in the center, the sailors offer their Japanese flag. Bernie adds the flag at the top.Bobby and Julie start to load the animals, but Dugan says they can't bring them on board. This angers Bobby, who says that Julie kept saying that Dugan was nice, but his refusal to board the animals now proves otherwise. Julie gets upset, and Dugan finally relents, allowing the animals to be loaded. Walking around to the other side of the plane, Dugan sees Bernie painting the name ""Noah's Ark"" on the side and tells her he hates the name ""Noah,"" but says that otherwise the name is fine.As the group prepares to depart the island, they can't find any sign of Cleveland or Hiro. When they can't wait any longer, they launch the boat, but just as they get into the water Cleveland and Hiro appear on the beach. They jump in the water and swim toward the boat. Dugan asks Cleveland and Hiro why they were late. Just then, they see several explosions on the hillside -- following orders they were given during the war, the sailors made sure they left nothing when they departed.The group sails toward Hawaii. As they sail, Bernie gets an idea about sending a message. Dugan ties a note to Petey and sends him off, but the duck heads in the wrong direction. Cleveland suggests they try fishing, but he and Hiro are unable to catch anything. Meanwhile, Brutus refuses to eat. Bobby tries to give him some milk, but Dugan stops him, saying the milk is their food supply and he doesn't want it being used to feed the animals. Annoyed, Bobby takes his milk ration and gives it to Brutus.That night, Bobby gets an idea to use a lantern to draw fish -- something he and a friend would do at the orphanage. The light draws the fish, but it also draws a shark, which scares the fish away. Using the last of their caught fish, Dugan, Hiro, and Cleveland go after the shark, but it gets away. Wanting to get a closer look, Bobby gets too close to the edge, slips, and falls in the water. Dugan jumps in after him and barely manages to get him back on board before the shark returns. As Dugan jumps on board, Bernie fires a gun at the shark, killing it. Bobby thanks Dugan for saving his life, but Dugan berates him, saying he nearly got both of them killed. Dugan orders Cleveland to take Bobby downstairs and get him changed.Below deck, Dugan asks the rest of the group to leave him and Bobby alone. He apologizes to Bobby. Bobby also apologizes for his behavior, and they agree to be friends.The next day, a storm hits, destroying part of the wooden decks on the boat but leaving it otherwise intact. After the storm clears, Brutus, who has fallen down, is lying on his side. Bobby asks if Brutus can be saved, but Bernie says there's nothing that can be done. Dugan pulls out a gun to put Brutus out of his misery, but Bobby refuses to let him be shot. Dugan asks Bobby what his dad would have done. Bobby says his dad left him at the orphanage and didn't care. Dugan says that now Bobby is surrounded by people who *do* care. Hiro takes the gun from Dugan, sits down next to Bobby, and gently talks to him in Japanese. Resigned to Brutus' fate, Bobby says a tearful goodbye to him, then nods to Hiro.As Hiro prepares to shoot Brutus, the group hears a whistle from a Coast Guard cutter, which has located them. As the cutter tows them toward shore, Brutus is shown to have fully recovered, while Dugan marries Bernie and they hug the kids."

She must choose between him and her current boyfriend, between Chicago and New York, and between research and administration.—David Metzler Chicago-based college mathematics professor Kate Gunzinger is at a complicated stage of her life. She has just moved in with her boyfriend, Homer, a builder, the move more out of a sense of ""why not"" than a compelling reason to do so. Their relationship is based on giving the other a total sense of freedom, which includes not being emotionally invested in the other's life. She has an interview for a job in New York City, which is more administrative than research, the balance which she could tolerate more than prefer. If she gets offered the job, she will not truly consider Homer in whether to accept it or not. Her widowed father Jacob is getting remarried in New York City at the same time as her interview, although she isn't sure if she will attend the wedding regardless since she doesn't like Emma, her new stepmother to be. At the last minute, Kate decides to attend the wedding. There, she not only gets a better sense of Emma not only as a woman but as her father's new wife, but also meets Emma's son, ex-Cleveland Indian Ben Lewin, who had to quit the game due to injuries. Despite Ben having a wife and daughter back home in Akron, the two embark on a more than casual relationship. Her short time with Ben that weekend gives Kate a better perspective on what is missing in her life, regardless of if there is a long term future for the two of them.—Huggo"
The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080731/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Fu's age-regressing elixir vitae is spilled by a hapless flunky, Fu Manchu sends his lackeys to round up supplies for a fresh batch of elixir, including a precious jewel, which prompts a team of agents to track him down. Fu Manchu's (Peter Sellers') 168th birthday celebration is dampened when a hapless flunky spills Fu's age-regressing elixir vitae. Fu sends his lackeys to round up ingredients for a new batch of elixir, starting with the Star of Leningrad diamond, nabbed from a Soviet exhibition in Washington, D.C. The F.B.I. sends Agents Joe Capone (Sid Caesar) and Pete Williams (Steve Franken) to England to confer with Sir Dennis Nayland Smith (Peter Sellers), an expert on Fu. Nayland suspects Fu will kidnap King George V (Rene Aranda) and Queen Mary (Grace Coyle) and demand the George V diamond as ransom. Scotland Yard recruits Alice Rage (Dame Helen Mirren) to stand-in for the Queen. Fu nabs the ""fake"" Queen; Rage becomes enamored of Fu and aids him in his quest for the George V diamond.—Dennis Lewis <dsl@sprynet.com> In 1933, in a castle located high in the Himalayas, master criminal, Dr. Fu Manchu (Peter Sellers), celebrates his birthday by demanding a vial of ""elixir vitae,"" a fountain-of-youth potion responsible for his 168 years of life. When a follower (Burt Kwouk) presents the elixir, his clothing catches fire from the candles on the birthday cake, so he douses the flames with the elixir. Fu Manchu orders the follower tortured and killed, then announces to his other bandit followers, the Dacoits, that they must carry out several international robberies to gather the precious ingredients for more elixir.In America, a Dacoit is sent to a Washington, D.C., museum, where he observes the Star of Leningrad diamond, and learns that Czar Nicolai presented an identical canary diamond to his cousin, King George V, that is on display in London. At night, the Dacoit steals the jewel.In London, FBI agent Giuseppe ""Joe"" Capone (Sid Ceasar) and his assistant, Pete Williams (Steve Franken), visit Commissioner Roger Avery (David Tomlinson) and his nephew and assistant, detective inspector Robert Townsend (Simon Williams), at Scotland Yard to discuss the case. When Commissioner Avery is shown a clue, he immediately recognizes it as belonging to the Si-Fan, the dangerous, secret Asian crime organization headed by Fu Manchu. The FBI agents ask to speak to Inspector Nayland Smith (Peter Sellers in a dual role), an authority on the Si-Fan, but learn that he is retired.When the Scotland Yard police and the FBI special agents journey to Smith's country home to coax him out of retirement, the retired Inspector examines the evidence and corroborates that the robbery is the work of the Si-Fan. Although Joe Capone believes that Fu Manchu died in 1890, Smith claims that the criminal is alive and well. Just before Smith's retirement, Fu Manchu was responsible for three unrelated diamond robberies. Smith explains that all three jewels represented key ingredients of the elixir vitae that Fu Manchu needs to maintain eternal youth.Later, Smith agrees to work on the case when he deduces that Fu Manchu is assembling a fresh batch of elixir, and will strike next to obtain the George V canary diamond displayed in the Tower of London. There, museum director Sir Nules Thudd assures Commissioner Avery that the jewel is safe behind bars, guarded by a sophisticated alarm system with several guards standing duty. Meanwhile, as Fu Manchu's strength diminishes, he receives electric jolts to his heart that temporarily restore his vitality.At lunch, Smith shares his theory that Fu Manchu will kidnap the royal couple and demand the jewel as ransom instead of stealing the diamond outright. He proposes that Scotland Yard plant decoys to outsmart Fu Manchu. The agents hold auditions to recruit the royal doubles from within their ranks to foil the predicted kidnapping, and Constable Alice Rage (Helen Mirren) is chosen to assume the role of Queen Mary. When Alice, impersonating the Queen, makes a speech at the Botanical Society, she and surrounding officials fall unconscious after breathing the vapors of a deadly plant strategically left by Dacoits. However, the kidnapping plot fails when the kidnappers are unable to move the ""Queen"" because Smith has handcuffed her to a railing.Soon, King George informs Commissioner Avery that the royal couple plans to attend the theater, so the police alter their strategy. With binoculars, Smith sees several Dacoits waiting to strike, but warns the FBI to wait. When the royal couple appears at their box seats, five sets of identically dressed impostors join them as the national anthem plays. As a result of the confusion, the royal couple is saved and the Dacoits are arrested.Later, Fu Manchu disguises himself as Charles Rotten, an antique dealer that the Queen is scheduled to visit. When Rotten shows Alice some new tapestries, the undercover agent is kidnapped. She is transferred to a secret location in back of a Chinese restaurant, where she informs Fu Manchu and the Dacoits of her real identity. Before she places them under arrest, Fu Manchu serves Alice a glass of rare and addictive wine. Soon, villain and policewoman are singing a music hall duet when a restaurant worker informs Fu Manchu that Nules Thudd is dining at the establishment. Fu Manchu instructs the Dacoits to have Nules tortured by Dr. Arnold Wretch, an obesity specialist.Meanwhile, Alice agrees to play the saxophone as Fu Manchu offers her a lifetime of luxury if she becomes his consort. For treatment, Wretch orders Nules to walk on stilts in a park, where Fu Manchu tempts him with a Chinese banquet. Alice, pretending to be an aristocrat hosting the party, introduces Nules to Fu Manchu disguised as chef Fu. Fu suggests that Nules can enjoy the banquet in return for Fu being allowed to look at the King George V diamond. After Fu Manchu has stolen the diamond and the Crown Jewels of England, he informs Nayland Smith by phone that he has gathered all the elixir ingredients and mayhem will follow.In pursuit of Fu Manchu, Smith and the other agents travel to the retired Inspector's home, which transforms into a hot air balloon that transports them to Nepal. Meanwhile, Alice has joined Fu Manchu at his castle, where he discovers his freshly made elixir is defective. When the Dacoits surround and shoot at Smith's cottage after it lands, Smith demands to see Fu Manchu.At the castle, Smith confesses that the police planted a fake jewel and agrees to surrender the real George V diamond if Fu Manchu will return the Crown Jewels. When the other police officers arrive at the castle, Smith admits that he saved their lives by giving the real diamond to Fu Manchu. Drinking the improved elixir vitae shaves years off of Fu Manchu's life. Alice distributes the missing Crown Jewels to the British officers and the FBI agents receive the Star of Leningrad diamond. For Smith, Fu Manchu has prepared a small bottle of elixir vitae but warns him not drink it until he returns to England. Fu Manchu also suggests that ingesting the elixir will expose Smith to forces he will not be able to resist. When Smith asks for a clue to prepare him for what might happen, the lights dim and Fu Manchu transforms into an Asian Elvis Presley and launches into a rock and roll song ""Rock A Fu"" with the Dacoits singing backup."

Also one of the Knights is going to Vietnam, so he is making the best of his last day. And another member is having problems with his girlfriend.—rcs0411@yahoo.com During the opening credits, the voice of deejay Surf Sam (Dave Sebastian Williams) of radio station KBLA announces that Halloween night 1965 is hours away, and that Tubby's Drive-In, the Hollywood Knights' hangout, is closing for good that evening. An egg hits the name of director Floyd Mutrux.The leader of the Knights, Newbomb Turk (Robert Wuhl), pulls a dead body prank on an elderly woman with one of his friends hiding under the tarp cover of the 1965 El Camino he borrowed from his older brother.Sally (Fran Drescher) and her friends are tanning (some topless) by the pool, and Newbomb catches some instant photos with his camera before they discover him and drive him off.Officer Bimbeaux (Gailard Sartain) and Officer Clark (Sandy Helberg) meet with the police chief. He warns the officers not to aggravate the situation about the drive-in on its last evening of business. He then notices that the Knights have tagged the side of the patrol car with spray paint.The Beverly Hills Residents Association meets at the home of Jacqueline Friedman (Leigh French). Bimbeaux and Clark stand by in the kitchen, arguing loudly about popular music. The doorbell brings Jacqueline and her secret lover Nevans (Richard Schaal) onto the porch where a flaming bag of dog poop awaits them, and the Knights moon them from their car as they speed off.At nightfall, three of the Knights: Wheatly (Randy Gornel), Shorty (Glenn Withrow) and Simpson (P.R. Paul) meet Newbomb at Tubby's Drive-In restaurant and ask whether it is a good idea to borrow the El Camino. Simpson promises he will bring his custom rail job car later.In the patrol car, Clark asks Bimbeaux if he would look good in a mustache, and sings about Lawrence of Arabia. Bimbeaux argues the movie soundtrack has no lyrics.The Knights drive to Watts with their four club pledges, order them to strip naked and retrieve the four tires in the trunk. For initiation, they must request a song from the KBLA deejay and return to Tubby's Drive-In by 2:00 am in the morning. Surf Sam turns over the broadcast to Doctor J (Humble Harvey Miller).Back in Hollywood, the Knights hide in a tree to wait for Sally and the girls to arrive at their secret spot to change into other, more sexy clothes for the pep rally. As they remove their bras, Newbomb loses his balance and gives them away; the girls flee as the cops arrive. Bimbeaux reads off the Knights.At Smitty's Auto Shop located right next door to Tubby's Drive-In, fellow Knight Duke (Tony Danza) and his girlfriend Suzie Q (Michelle Pfeiffer), a car hop waitress at Tubby's, discuss her upcoming screen test and her job as a carhop. She needs a flexible schedule to pursue her acting career. Duke complains that men making wisecracks about her disturb him, and she argues that she is the one who must tolerate it.Meanwhile, the Iron Box Twins, Brenda and Shirley Weintraub (Joyce Heiser, Roberta Wallach), arrive at the drive-in for burgers, and when the song ""Volare"" plays on the radio the girls pull off to avoid Newbomb, who tends to do a farting version of the song. Jimmy Shine (Gary Graham) discusses his deployment to Vietnam with Duke and Smitty (James Jeter), their mentor. Moosie (Moosie Drier), a youngster with a penchant for skateboards, arrives. The officers yell at him for carrying cigarettes, but he then hops a ride with some of the girls in their convertible. Sally cruises off with a college-aged man to Newbomb's disappointmentWhile driving down a road in Hollywood, Newbomb shows the girls the pictures he took of them at the pool. He parks the El Camino by a fire hydrant outside the high school to go to the pep rally and ignores warnings from his friends. At the rally, Jacqueline brings her husband Jack (Garry Goodrow) onstage with local weatherman Thorny Thornwell (Will Thornbury). The band enters the gym, and a banner is unfurled which reads, ""Beat the Panthers,"" with graffiti (""shit out of the"") added in the middle, tagged by the Knights.Elsewhere, the overweight and slow-witted Dudley Laywicker (Stuart Pankin) and his overbearing mother (Mina Kolb) drive to the rally for Dudley to receive his honor student check for $500 to cover his first year of college tuition. He is wearing his band uniform and balks when his mother suggests stopping at a restaurant because he says the staff teases him when he arrives in uniform. She ignores him.Jacqueline is making out in a car with Nevans when Dudley arrives and asks for her opinion of which magic trick he should use for the evening's talent contest. Nevans hides on the floor of the back seat, but Dudley spots Nevans' trousers. As Jacqueline tries to make an excuse, Dudley accidentally hits the car horn, which jams on. Jacqueline shoos him away. Newbomb and the Knights startle Dudley into a pseudo asthmatic fit. Dudley begs for his puffer inhaler, asking them not to hurt him as he might be a bleeder. Newbomb borrows parts of his uniform.Back at the rally, one of the Beverly Hills cheerleaders innocently forgets her underpants and flashes the crowd during a cheer.The officers spot the El Camino at the fire hydrant and call to have it impounded. Some of the Knights in hiding egg the cops and sing the Lawrence of Arabia tune Clark had sung earlier.Jack Friedman announces that Dudley is coming onstage for his scholarship check, but Newbomb takes the stage in Dudley's uniform and launches into his farting rendition of ""Volare,"" escaping by outrunning security. The other Knights tell Newbomb that Bimbeaux towed the El Camino. They speed out, leaving behind Dudley to retrieve his discarded clothes. The officers mistakenly think Dudley is the perpetrator until the faculty and school photographer arrive and straighten everything out.Meanwhile, two of the pledges in Watts are hiding in the bushes outside a couple's home (and realize they are making love) while the other two borrow makeshift outfits from white sheets on the clothesline. The corner of a pillowcase stands up on one pledge's head, and the husband spots it and grabs his shotgun, thinking he sees the KKK. The boys flee, finally arriving across from the record store but unable to figure out how to get to the deejay.Newbomb returns to Tubby's Drive In in his parents station wagon, labeled as the ""pie wagon"" (his parents own and work at a local bakery and their station wagon is their vehicle used to make deliveries). He hides under it when his older brother (Demetre Phillips) arrives looking for the El Camino and tells the Knights if anything happens to the car, he will strangle Newbomb. The others cover for Newbomb and he fakes indifference when the coast is clear.In the women's restroom, the Iron Box Twins discuss a rumor about the Friedmans' daughter until they find that Newbomb has hidden in a stall and tape-recorded them.Surfer dude Tarzan (Gary Prendergast) arrives at Tubby's with his two hot blonde girlfriends Jane (Carol Ann Williams) and Cheetah (Debra Feuer). Newbomb drives them around the neighborhood in their custom Woody, tries to score a feel and gets a milkshake dumped on him. At the same time, Simpson and Wheatly race another souped-up car, and when they lose, they discuss whether the Knights will stay together once some of the members go to Vietnam or college. Wheatly says Simpson can cruise with him and the Knights will not ever break up.A catering van pulls up at the high school dance, and the Knights convince them to hand over the punch they are delivering. Newbomb tells the caterers to detour the van through the hibiscus gardens because the area will soon be dug out for the Newbomb Turk Memorial Library. The Knights, in a tribute to Tubby's, spike the punch by urinating in it. Moosie warns people going into the dance but, when Bimbeaux and Clark catch him with a cigarette, he tells them to enjoy the punch. At the punch bowl, Jacqueline and Nevans discuss the strange beverage and summon the officers. Bimbeaux tries the punch and asks for seconds. The caterers, anxious to be finished for the night, decide to drive through the bushes as Newbomb said, and the underbrush wrecks the delivery van. The faculty members and Jacqueline are furious that the Knights are involved again.Jane and Cheetah join in another plot and flash Dudley so they can borrow his clothes again. Newbomb and the other Knights again ambush Dudley to take his clothes. Dudley asks Newbomb to be careful with the rented magician's cape when he goes to the talent contest. Beside the stage, Shorty switches out the PA system and replays the recording of the bathroom conversation by the Iron Box Twins for the audience, to the embarrassment of the twins and Jack, who is the emcee.Simpson assures Dudley that he will be back shortly in his rail job and to stay put while he is missing his clothes (and with them, his glasses and puffer). Jack Friedman announces the next talent contestant, Mr. Sasha Dabinski, the One-Armed Violinist. Dabinski is actually Wheatly, with Newbomb accompanying him at the piano; hiding one arm inside the waistband of the pants, Wheatly holds the violin with his chin, rasps a solo with his free hand, then grabs the bow at his crotch.Jacqueline and Nevans leave the usual confines of his car to make out on a trampoline, only to meet up with Dudley, who is stumbling around in the dark without his glasses and accidentally locks them out of their car. Nearby, Sally brushes off her college boyfriend, Dark, in favor of Newbomb, and they head to the pie wagon.Some of the Knights, as well as Dudley, Tarzan, at least one of the Tubby's car hops, and several other people are now at Sally's house in a wild party where several of them strip off their clothing and jump into the backyard swimming pool. In the garage, as Newbomb and Sally get ready to make love in his car, Newbomb is unable to hold out long enough and premature ejaculates. She whines at him for being immature, but he is relieved.At Smitty's Auto Shop, Smitty, Duke and his co-workers they reveal a special custom car to Jimmy Shine as a going away present. Their guest, custom car man Tony Nancy, and the men show Jimmy a tape deck inside playing the Mamas and the Papas 'California Dreaming' as Jimmy thinks about his deployment the next day.The time is now 1:00 am in the morning. Back in South-Central Watts, two local thieves strip tires from a parked car just as the four pledges (now wearing dresses stolen from another homeowner's clothesline) pass by with their tires from the Knights' car, and the homeowners give chase... mistakenly thinking that the four teens stole their tires.Back at the shop, Smitty is discussing his time in the war, when he and a man known as Grease modified a jeep engine and buzzed General MacArthur during a parade. Grease later died in a drunken crash. As they reflect on the tragedies of war, Jimmy Shine says he wants the new car to go to the club if anything happens to him in Vietnam, but the other men tell him not to worry.Back in Watts, the pledges decide to take their chances with a group of four Do-Wop street corner singers, hoping they can give the song dedication to the deejay. The pledges are running out of time to return to Beverly Hills. The singers ask the pledges if they are familiar with marijuana and agree to take on the task after the boys share a toke.Back at Tubby's, officers Bimbeaux and Clark receive an upbraiding by the captain on their radio. Still, Bimbeaux cannot resist teasing Newbomb about the impounded El Camino, and Newbomb decides to get even when the officer uses the restroom. Shorty fixes the restroom doorknob with his handy screwdriver, and Tarzan gets a potato for the tailpipe of the patrol car. While Clark waits in the car, he draws a fake mustache on his face using a marker. Bimbeaux goes into the bathroom. The toilet, stopped up with toilet paper, floods the floor when he flushes. Outside Newbomb dumps cans of garbage in front of the door. When Bimbeaux is trapped in the bathroom and calls for help, Clark shoots out the doorknob with his service pistol, and Bimbeaux slides on the trash when he comes out, ruining his uniform.Simpson arrives with his rail job (having hooked up with one of the Tubby's car hops). Dudley jumps in front of the patrol car when the officers attempt to give chase, as if seized by epilepsy, then jumps up and escapes the cops by hopping a ride in the rail job. When the officers try again to pursue, they hit another car.Returning to the drive-in at closing time at 2:00 am, Jimmy Shine gives Dudley his Knights jacket to watch until he returns from Vietnam. When the Knights suggest picking up the pledges they left in Watts, at first Dudley panics, then he takes a final drag on his puffer and discards it, ready to go.Duke and Suzie talk at last. She says she cares more about him than her screen test. Duke confesses that he was worried if she became an actor he would not be good enough for her, but she says she loves him and they reconcile with a kiss.The street corner singers meet Doctor J on KBLA just in time, and he announces the request on the radio as the four pledges arrive at Tubby's parking lot, the requested song plays to end the Halloween broadcast, and they earn their Knights jackets. Jimmy Shine leaves to have a farewell late-night dinner with his family before he departs for Vietnam and he hugs Smitty, who has been like a father to him.Newbomb tells Sally that he wants to keep in touch with her after graduation when she will be attending UCLA.Dudley calls his mother from a payphone to tell her he will be late because he has an assignation with a girl and is going to get laid, and she faints.Some distance away, Jacqueline and Nevans are still experiencing aftereffects from the spiked punch, but are in Nevans' car parked outside her home. She assures him that her husband is too drunk to wake up. When the cops give chase to the Knights, the patrol car crashes into Nevans' car and Jack appears, catching the two with their clothes in disarray as Newbomb, Dudley, Simpson and the Knights moon them all.In the final scene, Tubby's Drive In shuts off their lights for the last time as the end credits roll."

He meets Elise and they fall in love, which does not make her manager, William Fawcett Robinson, rather happy. Will their love survive Robinson's disapproval? Will Richard be able to remain in 1912?—Kathy Chelsen In 1972, college theater student Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) celebrates the success of his first play. During the celebration, he is approached by an elderly woman who places an antique pocket watch into his hand and pleads ""Come back to me.""

Feeling stressed from writing his play, he decides to take a break and travels out of town to the Grand Hotel. While looking at a display in the hotel's museum, Richard becomes entranced by a strangely captivating photograph of a mysterious, beautiful young woman. With the help of Arthur Biehl (Bill Irwin), an old man who has been at the hotel since 1910, Richard discovers that she is Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour), a famous early 20th-century stage actress.

Richard becomes obsessed with traveling back to 1912 and meeting Elise, who he has fallen in love. He seeks out Professor Finney, who believes that he briefly traveled through time through the power of self-hypnosis. To accomplish this process, one must remove all things from sight that are related to the current time. Finney warns Richard that such a process would leave one very weak physically, possibly dangerously so. Back in his hotel room, Richard dresses himself in an early 20th-century suit, and attempts to will himself into 1912 using tape-recorded suggestions. The attempt fails because he lacks real conviction, but after finding an old guest book from 1912 containing his signature, Richard realizes that he will eventually succeed.Richard again hypnotizes himself (without the benefit of a modern tape recorder) and allows his absolute faith in his eventual success to become the tipping point or trigger for the journey back through time. He slowly falls asleep and awakens to the sound of whinnying horses in the year 1912. Richard looks all over the hotel for Elise, even meeting Arthur Biehl as a little boy, but has no luck finding Elise. Finally, he stumbles upon Elise walking by a tree near the lake. She seems to swoon slightly when seeing him, but then suddenly asks upon meeting him ""Is it you?"" McKenna's overbearing manager, William Fawcett Robinson (Christopher Plummer), abruptly intervenes and sends Richard away. Richard stubbornly continues to pursue Elise until she agrees to accompany him on a stroll through the surrounding idyllic landscape. Richard ultimately asks why Elise wondered aloud ""Is it you?"" and she replies that Robinson somehow knows that she will meet a man who will change her life forever, and that she should be afraid. Richard then shows Elise the same pocket watch which she will eventually give him 60 years in the future.Upon returning to the hotel, Elisa invites Richard to her play. He attends the comical-farce and she, in an almost trance-like state, recites an impromptu monologue dedicated to him. During intermission, he finds her posing formally for a photograph. Upon spotting Richard, Elise breaks into a radiant smile and veritably glows with soft affection. Just then, the camera's flash goes off and forever captures that wonderous moment in time. We now know that this picture is the same one that Richard will see 68 years later on a wall near the lobby at the Grand Hotel. He later receives a letter from Robinson asking to meet him immediately and saying that it is a matter of life and death. Robinson wants Richard to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. Richard thinks Robinson is in love with Elise, but Robinson states that he is obsessed with her being a star and has no romantic interest in her. When Richard professes his love for her, Robinson has him bound and locked inside the stables. Robinson then informs Elise that Richard has left her and isn't the one, though she doesn't believe him and professes her love for Richard.Richard wakes up the next morning and escapes his constraints. He discovers that the acting troupe has already left for Denver, though Elise has returned to the hotel to find him. Richard then goes out to the hotel's capricious deck and begins giving into despair, but presently perceives Elise calling his name and running towards him. They return to his room together and it is there that Elise becomes truly intimate with a man for the very first time in her life. Later that evening, she asks Richard to marry him and he readily accepts. She then informs him that the first thing she will do for him is to buy him a new suit (the suit Richard has been wearing the entire time in 1912 is about 10 to 15 years out of style). Richard begins to show his true love how wonderful the suit is on account of its many pockets. He is alarmed when he reaches into one and finds a shiny modern Lincoln penny with the mint date of 1979. This modern item breaks his hypnotic suggestion, and Richard feels himself rushing backwards from 1912 as though through a tunnel, and Elise screams his name in horror as he is pulled inexorably back to the present.Richard wakes up in the same room he just left, although now it is 68 years later. He is very weak and physically and emotionally exhausted from his trip through time and from the devastating unexpected return. He scrambles desperately back to his own suite and attempts to hypnotize himself again, without success. After wandering around the hotel property and sitting interminably at the places where he spent time with Elise, Richard eventually retires to his room and remains there unmoving for days until discovered by Arthur and the hotel manager; they send for a doctor and paramedics. Richard suddenly smiles and sees himself drifting above his body and is drawn to a light shining through the nearby window, where he is reunited forever with Elise."
Tom Horn,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080031/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ex-army scout is hired by ranchers to kill cattle rustlers but he gets into trouble with the corrupt local officials when he's suspected of killing a boy. A renowned former army scout is hired by ranchers to hunt down rustlers but finds himself on trial for the murder of a boy when he carries out his job too well. Tom Horn finds that the simple skills he knows are of no help in dealing with the ambitions of ranchers and corrupt officials as progress marches over him and the old west.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> The film opens with the following text: ""Based on a true story. He grew up in the violence of the Old West. He became a cowboy, rode shotgun for the stage lines, was an agent for the Pinkertons and fought with the Rough Riders under Teddy Roosevelt. He made his reputation as a cavalry scout by capturing Geronimo in the bloody Apache wars. In 1901, he drifted into Wyoming Territory.""In 1900 Wyoming, cowboy Tom Horn (Steve McQueen) boards his horse at a stable and visits the local saloon for a whiskey. There, he insults the locals, toasting a picture of Indian Chief Geronimo instead of an up-and-coming boxer named ""Gentleman"" Jim Corbett (Steve Oliver). When Corbett beats him, Tom takes refuge in the barn with his horse. A rancher named John Coble (Richard Farnsworth) finds Tom after witnessing the fight, and offers him shelter and a job after he recovers from his injuries.Riding to Coble's ranch, they stop at Brown's Hole to water the horses. There, one horse rustler fires his gun at Coble's feet, and orders him to dance. Tom pulls his rifle and shoots the cowboy in the foot. As the wounded rustler vows revenge, Coble explains the incident is typical of conflicts in the area, and soon hires Tom to ward off cattle rustlers.Later, at a Cattlemen's Association picnic, Coble introduces Tom as a legendary tracker and interpreter of the Apache wars. During the lobster meal, U.S. Marshal Joe Belle (Billy Green Bush) takes Tom aside and says Tom can conduct business by bringing rustlers to trial or by shooting them. Afterward, schoolteacher Glendolene Kimmel (Linda Evans) teases Tom about eating lobster for the first time. She reveals that she is originally from Hawaii, but has always been attracted to the West. Meanwhile, Joe sees Tom as a threat to his reputation as the town's top lawman, and as a rival for Glendolene's affection. Coble soothes Joe's worries by reminding him that Tom is there to do the dirty work, so that Joe can concentrate on his political aspirations.Later, Tom tracks down four rustlers and starts a gunfight. He shoots two men dead and kills a third from a distance. He then spares the life of the last rustler, but orders him to spread the word about Tom's deeds. Back at the Coble ranch, Tom ropes wild horses, and breaks a horse to present to Glendolene. When he gives her a riding lesson, he wonders aloud how he fits into her adventures, and they kiss.One day, Tom confronts a rustler, Lee, at his cabin after warning him to cease his stealing. Lee responds by killing Tom's horse, and Tom, in turn, fires several bullets into Lee's body. Afterward, he sets fire to the man's cabin. Later, another rustler opens fire on Tom as he does his errands in town. After Tom kills the man in self-defense, townspeople come out to view the carnage. As Marshal Belle inspects the body, Tom retreats to a nearby hotel to dress his wound.After the town shooting, the cattlemen meet and warn Coble the newspaper will soon report that they are backing Tom. Marshal Belle tells Coble it is time to fire Tom before a scandal erupts.One day in town, several cowboys inform Tom that 15-year-old Jimmy Nolt has been killed by the same gun that Tom carries. Soon after, Glendolene tells Tom that he is being framed. He walks to the saloon, asks for a whiskey, and reads the newspaper account of Nolt's death. At his office, Marshal Belle invites newspaper reporter, Charlie Ohnhouse (Drummond Barclay), to hide and record the confession he plans to force from Tom. The marshal then invites Tom to his office to discuss the contents of a letter he received from Montana. He tells Tom of a job offer in Montana to police cattle rustlers, then compliments Tom's way with a rifle, adding that the shooter killed Jimmy from a distance of 213 feet. Tom says his rifle is not capable of making such a clean shot, but Joe disagrees. Tom replies if he did make the shot it would be the best of his career, and his dirtiest trick. Marshal Belle does not get the confession he anticipated, and Tom leaves. Later, Sheriff Sam Creedmore and his deputy, Earl Proctor, arrest Tom for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.When reporters ask Coble if the Cattlemen's Association hired Tom, and if they plan to pay for his defense, Coble does not respond. In private, Coble warns Tom not to break out of jail because people will assume he is guilty. In his jail cell, Tom recalls romancing Glendolene in an outdoor tub, but is interrupted by a stranger on a horse, who shoots at him. Tom returns fire, kills the man, and finishes him off with the butt of his rifle.In the present, Tom asks the sheriff to return his Indian charms, and learns that members of the National Guard are stationed outside to prevent his escape. Coble brings Tom a suit to wear for trial, hires an attorney for his defense, and warns him to remain as closed-mouthed as possible around the prosecuting attorney, Walter Stoll. If Stoll wins a conviction, he will be considered a hero and it will ensure his re-election. Coble apologizes, adding that he did not realize the cattlemen would go to such extremes to remove Tom. Tom says that no matter what happens, he knows Coble is his friend.When the entire town shows up for Tom's trial, the first witness, reporter Ohnhouse, perjures himself on the stand, claiming that Tom bragged to Marshal Belle about killing Jimmy. Then, Stoll questions Tom, who refuses to admit or deny the charge, and leaves. The next morning at the jailhouse, Tom knocks deputy Earl unconscious when he stoops to get a closer look at Tom's Indian charms. Tom steals the key, beats a deputy, and steals his gun. He runs from town on foot, but is quickly beaten and captured. Later, Tom is sentenced to death by hanging for Jimmy's murder.As Tom waits for his execution, he remembers happier times, riding with Glendolene on the plains. She criticizes his way of life, and warns that eventually society will pass judgment. She admits that she no longer wants to be a part of his world, and says goodbye. As Tom remembers sleeping with Glendolene under the stars, he is called to his execution. He stops along the way to congratulate Marshal Belle on his engagement to Glendolene. As the town watches, Sam places the noose around Tom's neck. The cowboy delivers one last insult to deputies before the trap is sprung, and he falls to his death. His Indian charms clatter as they hit the ground beneath him.The film ends with another text:""The story is done... I am proud to say that he was my friend, always faithful and just. I am convinced, and I re-assert it to be true, that Tom Horn was guiltless of the crime for which he died. [Signed] John C. Coble. March 1, 1904, Bosler, Wyoming."""

Breaker Morant,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080310/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three Australian lieutenants are court martialed for executing prisoners as a way of deflecting attention from war crimes committed by their superior officers. During the Boer War, three Australian lieutenants are on trial for shooting Boer prisoners. Though they acted under orders, they are being used as scapegoats by the General Staff, who hopes to distance themselves from the irregular practices of the war. The trial does not progress as smoothly as expected by the General Staff, as the defence puts up a strong fight in the courtroom.—Kasper Sevaj <kaspsev@dorit.ihi.ku.dk> Late 1901, South Africa. Lieutenants Harry ""Breaker"" Morant, Peter Handcock and George Witton are senior officers of the Bushveldt Carbineers, part of the Australian Army under the command of the British Army in the Boer War. The Carbineers' reason for being is largely to battle the loose collection of Boer guerrillas who are not part of the Boer army, but who are fighting against the British military regardless. The three are facing a collective court martial, for Morant allegedly ordering, as the officer in charge, the execution of six Boer prisoners, Witton allegedly killing one of those six before they were to be executed, and Handcock's alleged associated killing of a German missionary, Reverend Daniel Heese. Morant and Witton admit to their killings, but Morant, an ex-pat Brit with a poetic streak, claims that it was on an order issued indirectly by Lord Kitchener through his friend and former commanding officer, now deceased Captain Simon Hunt, and Witton, the young somewhat naive officer, claims he killed in self-defense as the prisoner charged him. And the charge against Handcock, the brash cocky one, is all circumstantial as there are no eyewitnesses. In reality, all charges were issued by Kitchener, using the three as scapegoats in a measure of political expediency to end the war, not caring that convictions could and probably will lead to sentences of execution. The British military stacking the decks against the three is further demonstrated by prosecutor Captain Alfred Taylor having six weeks to prepare, while defense attorney Major J.F. Thomas only having one day, in addition to Thomas having no trial experience, let alone no court martial experience. Regardless, a defiant Thomas vows to find out the truth and to defend his clients to the best of his abilities, which is better than most expect.—Huggo Brilliant depiction of a little known war and the brutality of war. The ending is quite superb. Mateship as shown by the two condemned soldiers walking to their execution with their hands held together is a fine end to the film. Great acting by a stellar cast of Australian actors—marchionniphilip South Africa, 1901. The British war against the Boers has deteriorated into bitter guerilla warfare. A unit of the Bushveladt Carbineers, made up mainly of Australians, is ordered by the British High Command to fight the Boer on it's terms and take no prisoners; an order which will prove fatal to a man they call 'The Breaker' - Lieutenant Harry Morant."
The Stunt Man,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081568/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fugitive stumbles onto a movie set just when they need a new stunt man, takes the job as a way to hide out and falls for the leading lady while facing off with his manipulative director. While on the run from the police, Steve Railsback hides in a group of moviemakers where he pretends to be a stunt man. Both aided and endangered by the director (Peter O'Toole) he avoids both the police and sudden death as a stuntman. The mixture of real danger and fantasy of the movie is an interesting twist for the viewer as the two blend in individual scenes.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Cameron is a Vietnam War veteran on the run from the police. While on the run, Cameron gets involved in an incident which is witnessed by Eli Cross, the enigmatic and ego-maniacal director upon whose WWI anti-war movie on-location set Cameron has inadvertently stumbled. Based on what he saw, Eli offers Cameron a job as the stunt double for the movie's lead character played by actor Raymond Bailey, the job offer despite Cameron never having done stunt work. Eli figures that the offer will solve both his and Cameron's short term problems. Cameron ends up being a daredevil of a stunt man, whose combined moxie and inexperience may jeopardize his safety and that of those around him. Yet Eli keeps him around. Cameron begins a relationship with the movie's lead actress, Nina Franklin. As Cameron gets to know those on set, especially Nina and Eli, he thinks he's figured out why Eli is keeping him around. Cameron, who by this time has opened up to Nina about his war experiences - which has resurfaced because of this movie - and his associated crime, shares his unseemly thoughts with her about Eli, her long time friend. Cameron ultimately believes that Eli will do anything required to get the shot that he wants.—Huggo Cameron is an ex-soldier on the run. He stumbles onto a movie location at a beach resort, and megalomaniacal director Eli Cross compels him to take the job of a stunt man, to replace one who earlier drowned in a dangerous stunt. While Cameron needs the cover offerred by the job and begins to fall in love with actress Nina Franklin, he worries that the fate intended for him by Eli is the same as the fate sufferred by his predecessor.—Reid Gagle Cameron (Steve Railsback), a Vietnam vet who's wanted for attempted murder, is caught by the police but escapes. Crossing a bridge, he dodges an antique car that seems to be trying to run him down; when he turns around, the car has disappeared. While he wonders whether it went into the river, a helicopter flies close to the bridge and a man inside looks intently at Cameron. Later, Cameron is attracted to a movie shoot -- a World War I battle scene -- on the beach. After the scene, he notices an old woman who walks through the set greeting the actors, then falls in the water. Cameron dives in to rescue her and is horrified when she pulls off her face -- a mask. She's not an old woman, but the movie's leading lady, Nina Franklin (Barbara Hershey), testing the costume and make-up for the scenes set late in her character's life.The director, Eli Cross (Peter O'Toole), descends from the sky on his camera crane. This is his second entrance from on high; Eli is the same man who stared at Cameron from the helicopter. He offers Cameron a job, explaining that their last stunt man just ran a car off a bridge. They haven't found the body, and Eli can't afford the production delays that will result if the police get involved. The local police chief is aware of the accident on the bridge and Eli has to do some fast talking to convince him that Cameron is Burt, the stunt man who went off the bridge into the river. (Eli claims divers pulled him out of the car, and Cameron is convincingly damp, having just pulled Nina out of the ocean.) Cameron's job is to pretend to be Burt and do his stunts -- a role within a role that allows both Eli and Cameron to avoid entanglements with the police.Cameron is rechristened ""Lucky."" Denise (Sharon Farrell), the film's hair stylist, dyes his hair and makes a pass at him. Ostensibly the color change is to make him resemble the blond leading man, Raymond Bailey (Adam Roarke) -- Lucky is Ray's stunt double -- but of course it also, conveniently, makes him harder to recognize. There's a running theme about how the movies are all about making things look like what they're not. When Cameron is convinced Eli's selling him out by showing the cops the film shot when Burt ran off the bridge -- because Cameron's in it -- Eli reassures him by telling him that the original King Kong from the 1933 movie ""was just 3 foot 6 inches tall -- he only came up toFay Wray's belly button. If God could do the tricks that we can do, he'd be a happy man."" ""How tall was King Kong?"" becomes their catchphrase.Lucky learns stunt work under the tutelage of Chuck (Charles Bail), the stunt coordinator; there's some cool detail about how stunts are pulled off. (To film part of the wing-walking scene, they tether the plane to the ground and fly in circles at an altitude of about 6 feet.) There's an elaborate scene where Lucky, standing in for the leading man, is chased up and down the sloping red roofs of a large building (in real life, the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego, California), shot at, and falls through a skylight into a bordello. Lucky is thrilled to learn he'll be paid $600 for the scene. At the same time, Lucky/Cameron's getting involved with Nina -- who, it turns out, once had a romance with Eli and still admires him tremendously. Eli admits to her that he's jealous of Lucky.The last shoot at the current location involves Lucky's most difficult stunt, driving a Duesenberg off a bridge and escaping under water -- the same scene Burt was shooting when he died. Lucky believes Eli is trying to kill him, and will use the stunt to make it look like an accident. It's plausible; killing Lucky would get him out of Nina's life and remove the most unreliable witness to the cover-up of Burt's death.In the wee hours of the morning before the shoot, Lucky and Nina have a heart-to-heart in the set shop and Lucky finally tells his story. He'd planned to open an ice cream shop with a friend when he got home from Vietnam, but the friend backed out -- he didn't want Cameron around because, Cameron realized, the friend was the guy Cameron's girlfriend had left him for. Cameron took out his fury one night on the ice cream shop (which he reenacts by trashing the set shop). When a cop turned up to see what was going on, Cameron threw a big tub of ice cream at him and fled. The cop was knocked out and spent several hours with his head in the ice cream, which didn't kill him but resulted in frostbite damage to his nose and ear and an attempted murder charge for Cameron, who's been on the run ever since. After Nina stops laughing, the couple plans to escape together: Nina hides in the trunk of the stunt car, which Cameron will drive away in the morning instead of driving off the bridge.Unbeknownst to Lucky, Chuck has planted an explosive in one of the Duesenberg's front tires to make the car's tumble off the bridge look more realistic. Lucky panics everyone by starting the scene too early. (He's in the Duesenberg with the windows rolled up and mistakes a question about the on-board camera for his cue.) The car goes into the water when Chuck triggers the exploding tire, and Lucky scrambles to reach Nina in the trunk -- until he happens to look up out of the sinking car's rear window to see Nina with Eli on the bridge. Lucky emerges, gasping, from the river and notices that there were divers in the water with him all the time. Nina tells him that she was found in the trunk hours before the shoot, and Eli told her that Lucky had changed his mind and decided to do the stunt. Lucky, of course, had done no such thing, but Nina's so pleased that he and Eli have made up that he doesn't set her straight. Eli, descending as usual from heaven on his crane, explains that he wouldn't let Lucky run off thinking that Eli was trying to kill him (and not incidentally leaving the film incomplete). The best way to convince Lucky of Eli's good will, Eli felt, was to make sure Lucky got through the stunt in one piece. Lucky, though furious -- not for the first time -- at Eli's high-handed manipulations, is amused in spite of himself and giddy with relief at surviving. As the movie ends, Cameron and Eli are bickering over Cameron's pay for the stunt and planning to catch a plane to the production's next location."

Where the Buffalo Roam,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081748/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Semi-biographical film based on the experiences of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. The deranged adventures of Gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson and his attorney Oscar Acosta, referred to in the movie as ""Laslow"". Thompson attempts to cover the Super Bowl and the 1972 Presidential election in his typical drug-crazed state, but is continually and comically sidetracked by his even more twisted friend Laslow. Allegedly based on actual events.—John Rumpelein <usviking@imageek.york.cuny.edu> Dr. Hunter Thompson, who is better known as the character in the Doonesbury Comic Strips Zonker's Uncle Duke, shows what earned his reputation for Gonzo Journalism, a sort of sideways way of looking at the news, including such things as giving away superbowl tickets so that he can review it from his hotel room while bouncing a football of the walls. A sort of latter-day cousin to stream-of-consciousness writing.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The film opens in the mountain cabin of one Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Bill Murray), gonzo journalist extraordinaire. He is holed up with his dog Bronco and a plethora of alcohol and drugs, struggling with a looming deadline to produce a magazine article about his eccentric former attorney, Carl Lazlo, Esq. (Peter Boyle). When his fax machine begins beeping with a call from his publisher, he angrily shoots it with one of his many guns (in this case, a .45 revolver); he then ""get[s] a grip"" and sits down to his typewriter. His voice-over narration reflects what he writes, as it does throughout the film.Fade to 1968, early in Thompson's career. He is holed up on an upper-story hospital room with a loud stereo, a pack of drugs and alcohol, and a nubile student nurse (Sunny Johnson). A nurse explains to a doctor that he arrived there claiming to have been chased by Richard Nixon and attacked by a swarm of bats. At this point, Lazlo, a wild-haired, mustachioed liberal attorney, arrives. Finding Thompson's room barricaded from the inside, he calmly walks through the neighboring (and occupied) room and, after helping himself to some of the patients' pills, climbs out onto the balcony and bursts into Thompson's room from the window. This sends Thompson's drugged-out companion into a nearly-catatonic state (she believes Lazlo to be a giant bat), but Lazlo remains calm as he offers his legal advice to Thompson and eats some food. (Lazlo eating some of Thompson's food is a running theme of the film and suggests that he [Lazlo] is not above sponging off those around him.) As the hospital staff begins to break down the door, Thompson and Lazlo unhurriedly escape and miraculously get down to Lazlo's car and escape just as the doctors and nurses break in.On the road, Thompson simultaneously drives and types Lazlo's running commentary about the sorry state of America's legal system, vis-a-vis their treatment of teenagers on drug charges. They arrive at the courthouse where Lazlo is about to go before a judge to defend a large group of kids who, in various combinations, have all been arrested for possession of marijuana. He insists on taking all the cases to bench trial, which serves only to irritate the judge and district attorney; all the defendants receive very harsh penalties. After one such outrage, when a teenager is given five years for possession of a joint, Lazlo reacts violently and ends up throwing the district attorney over the judge's bench. As the court is hurriedly cleared and Thompson struggles to snap pictures, Lazlo screams at him to ""tell the world"" what happened.Back at BLAST Magazine headquarters, Thompson's beleagured publisher Marty (Bruno Kirby) paces back and forth waiting for Thompson to deliver his story. Presently Thompson arrives, but teases Marty for a while before finally giving up the story in exchange for the cheque. Thompson's voice-over comes back in as we see Lazlo languishing in a jail cell with one of his defendants.Los Angeles, 1972; in voice-over, Thompson explains that Lazlo quit the legal system and dropped out of sight, and as the 60s ended many counterculturalists, in Thompson's words, ""got off the boat,"" but not everyone did, including Lazlo, Nixon, and himself. Now a successful and popular writer, Thompson is in town covering Super Bowl VI (this is an error, as the 1972 Super Bowl was actually held in New Orleans). He arrives at his hotel in a hallucinogenic state, mildly assaulting his driver before remembering where he is and what he is doing. At the front desk, he terrorizes the clerk by ordering large amounts of electronic equipment and food (including 16 grapefruit), and proceeds to turn his room into a slightly grotesque piece of modern art, complete with toilet paper and variously-placed fruit. When the hotel staff comes to quiet him down (as requested by a professional gambler [Leonard Gaines] who ""needs a super rest"" for the game), they are sucked into his world and willingly take the marijuana and alcohol he provides.The next morning, Thompson is sitting in the hotel restaurant, eating a huge breakfast and listening to his tape recorder. His recording from when he awoke says that he did so to find that the hotel employees had broken in, drank all his liquor, did all his drugs, and stole his dinner. At the entrance, the aforementioned gambler is speaking on the phone with an associate, bemoaning his sleepless night; just then Lazlo appears wearing a Nixon mask, which prompts the gambler to give up on the game and go home to escape the ""nuthouse."" Lazlo sits down at Thompson's table, gives him the mask as a present, and then persuades him to give up on the Super Bowl story and go with him to some unknown destination. Outside, Thompson gives his tickets, press pass, and room key to two random guys, and they set off.On the road, Lazlo talks about where he has been the past four years; namely, becoming enlightened. He now is actively trying to promote world revolution, and he does this with a small band of weirdos by smuggling weapons to revolutionaries in impoverished countries. At the ranch, Thompson quickly sees the futility of what Lazlo is doing but comes with him anyway to a rendezvous at a isolated airfield, where Lazlo's group will load up a plane with guns and fly it away. At the airstrip, however, a police helicopter arrives and begins to descend; Lazlo and his group escape in the loaded plane, but Thompson refuses to follow, and the police follow the copter.Later in 1972, Thompson is covering the presidential campaign, but takes some time to appear at a university for a Q&A with the students. The hall is packed and he is very late, and needs to be coaxed quite a bit by the event coordinator to even go on at all, but eventually goes out and wows the crowd with his eccentric views and answers. One student asks about Lazlo and puts forth the idea that he never really existed; Thompson responds that he was real, but he was now believed dead.Back on the campaign trail, he gets on the press plane that follows Richard Nixon (referred to only as ""the candidate"") around. He stands out starkly from the rest of the buttoned-down reporters, dressed in Bermuda shorts, a loud Hawaiian shirt, and a maroon sports jacket. Onboard, he frightens the young reporter next to him (Michael Cornelison) by producing an enormous hunting knife to slice his grapefruit (""They never search me""), then by speaking into his tape recorder about being divebombed by poisonous ravens on his way to catch the plane. Just then, the candidate's aide Dooley (Mark Metcalf) comes in and throws Thompson off the plane, demanding that he fly on the ""zoo"" plane with the technicians.The zoo plane is considerably different than the straight-laced reporter plane; the people are all hippies and drugs and alcohol flow freely (even amongst the crew). Also onboard this flight, though, is another reporter, Harris from the Post (Rene Auberjonois), due to overcrowding on the other plane. He sits down next to Thompson and tries to settle down to work, but the loud noise and constant physical distress drive him to distraction. That is, until Thompson produces some ""headache pills,"" his blue ones; Harris takes two, and within an hour he is in the grip of Thompson's powerful hallucinogens. By the time the plane lands, Thompson has switched their clothes and infiltrates the reporter entourage by posing as Harris.As he washes up in the bathroom, Thompson gets a surprise visitor: Nixon himself (Richard M. Dixon, but voiced by Brian Cummings) comes in to relieve himself. Thompson launches into a tirade that the country is divided into the ""Screwheads"" and the ""Doomed,"" who live in fear of the Screwheads. He asks Nixon what the country is doing for the Doomed, to which Nixon replies, ""Fuck the doomed!""Back aboard the reporter plane, on which Thompson has reappeared disguised as Harris, he suddenly spots none other than Lazlo walking across the tarmac, wearing a three-piece white suit. Realizing that the appearance of Lazlo will destroy his chance of continuing on the campaign trail, he hurriedly invites the same young reporter that he terrorized before (who does not recognize him in his disguise) to sit in his row and tell Lazlo that the seat between them is taken. He does so when Lazlo boards, but Lazlo ignores him and sits down next to Thompson. He begins telling him, in an increasingly excited and loud voice, about his new plan: to buy land in the middle of the desert and build a socialist paradise. At this point Dooley arrives and, fed up with Thompson, promptly throws him off the plane for good; when he insults Lazlo, Thompson punches him in the face and the two escape while Thompson holds the reporters and Secret Service at bay with a fire extinguisher (he gets a good shot in on Nixon when the candidate pokes his head out of his door for a moment). On the runway, Thompson watches as the plane takes off and tells Lazlo that he won't help him with his project, because Lazlo is ""insane, a raving maniac.""Back in the present at his ranch, Thompson finishes the story and sits down next to his dog to read him the end. Reading, he speaks of how Lazlo and Nixon were both gone (the latter being eaten by white cannibals on an island near Tijuana), and that he, Thompson, got out because, through it all, it never got weird enough for him."
The Gong Show Movie,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080808/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A week in the life of ""The Gong Show"" host and creator Chuck Barris who lives through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown and other comical characters involved in his life and work on the TV show. The Gong Show Movie is a 1980 film that shows a fictional week in the life of Chuck Barris as the host and creator of The Gong Show, through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a Roman Catholic priest and three nuns lip-synching Tom Lehrer's song ""The Vatican Rag"", the uncensored version of Jaye P. Morgan's infamous breast-baring incident and a man blowing out a candle with flatulence.—Wikipedia A homeless man (Brian O'Mullin) performs a spontaneous song and dance routine for Chuck Barris, host and star of the television talent contest ""The Gong Show,"" who is stopping at local Winchell's Donuts on his way to work. Barris dismisses the man's showmanship and spills coffee on his own shirt.At the television studio, Barris ignores an elderly violin player (Jack Bernardi), the singing group Satisfaction, a trumpet-playing comedian (Harvey Alpert), and dozens of other acts that accost him. When Barris arrives at his office, Buddy Didlo (James B. Douglas), network vice president of programs, says that the show's ratings have dropped slightly, making Barris ineligible for a raise. However, Barris carries on, auditioning 68 acts, which include strippers, folk singers, comedians, body-part playing musicians, street poets and human spiders. Later in the steam room, Barris' friend, Bernie (Harvey Lembeck), says that Barris looks tired and should pay more attention to his health.The next day, Barris tapes five ""Gong Show"" episodes. One act, Melvin Presar, a chicken-clucking singer, has a heart attack after being called on stage for several encores. At the hospital, Barris tells his girlfriend, Red (Robin Altman), that he feels guilty about making Melvin sick. However, Melvin is so happy to see Barris, he pulls off his oxygen mask and auditions his new act as a budding gingko tree. Barris leaves before Melvin finishes, but Dr. Jerry Queasley (David Sheiner), Melvin's doctor, auditions his ""singing chef"" act, which ends with Barris drenched in a bowlful of batter. As Barris and Red leave the hospital, Melvin performs until he is dragged back to his room.Red warns Barris to quit the show while he still has his sanity. She suggests he hire a substitute host, but Barris tells her the job beats working in a bank. To unwind, Barris plays guitar and sings with a group of friends called The Hollywood Cowboys. One night, the disgruntled sons of a failed contestant with plans for revenge approach Barris as he returns home. He persuades them to create an act instead of killing him. They later appear on the show and are eliminated by the same judge, who gonged their mother.Later, Didlo announces that ratings have improved, but too many television stations are canceling the show because of its offensive content. At a meeting at Matteo's restaurant to discuss the situation, Barris and Red are seated at a special table in the kitchen, as a cook auditions his singing act. When Didlo arrives, he complains that ""The Gong Show"" has turned into ""The Goon Show."" As Barris leaves for the men's room, Didlo follows, citing Barris' various offenses. Barris promises to behave, but then he pees on a man in the adjacent urinal after he is recognized.The next morning, Red fixes Barris breakfast in bed. However, Didlo barges in and insists that Barris sign a statement, agreeing to produce a tasteful show. Afterward, Barris meets with ""Gong Show"" judge, Jaye P. Morgan, who pledges to put an end to her double entendres. When Barris arrives late to work, multiple acts are waiting to audition and his secretary, Mabel, is worried that he looks tired. Nevertheless, Barris sits through auditions, reminding contestants to stay upbeat even if they are ""gonged.""Later, Red worries that Barris is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and sends him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Betsy Nolan (Cloyce Morrow), but the doctor determines that Barris is only suffering from exhaustion. He admits he is tired of the show and being known as a buffoon. He wants to do something meaningful. Dr. Betsy urges him to take time off and Red agrees. However, Barris cannot bring himself to stop, and suggests that he and Red end their relationship instead. As she walks out, he stares at photographs on the wall, documenting their love. Barris phones Mabel to announce that he is taking a hiatus and does not know when he will return.The next day, after buying a one-way ticket to Morocco, Barris walks aimlessly through the Moroccan desert until a helicopter appears and lands. A cloaked figure disembarks from the helicopter and approaches. It is Didlo with good news: the affiliate stations want Barris back, and so does Red. The whole entourage of the Gong Show appears to sing Barris ""Don't Get Up"".In the final scene, Barris returns to ""The Gong Show"" and receives a standing ovation. The audience is treated to acts like The Vatican Four, The Siamese Connection, Count Banjola, the Unknown Comic doing his impression of an Eskimo urinating, and the show goes on."
Motel Hell,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081184/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A seemingly friendly farmer and his sister kidnap unsuspecting travelers and bury them alive, using them to create the ""special meat"" they are famous for. Farmer Vincent kidnaps unsuspecting travelers and buries them in his garden. Unfortunately for his victims, they are not dead. He feeds his victims to prepare them for his roadside stand. His motto is ""It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent Fritters"". The film is gory, but it is also a parody of slasher films like The Last House on the Left.—Scott Lane <rslane@ix.netcom.com> Farmer Vincent and his younger sister Ida kidnap unsuspecting travelers and bury them alive in his field with their vocal cords slit to prevent them from screaming for help. Their family motto is ""It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent Fritters"". They fatten up their victims to prepare them for sale as a secret ingredient in their famous smoked meat. But the latest crop of them break free, seeking revenge on their captors. This film is a parody of slasher films. An elderly motel owner, famous for his smoked meat, kidnaps people by setting traps on roads and sometimes by luring people to visit his motel with fake advertisements of orgies and swinger parties. He is aided by his younger sister, while his naive sheriff younger brother is unaware of what is really going on. Things are going smoothly until a young woman falls in love with the motel owner, which causes a rift between him and his sister.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com Farmer and motel manager Vincent Smith has been providing smoked meat for more than 30 years to his neighbors and running the Motel Hello with his younger sister, Ida. Both of them have a secret ingredient in their meat that their clients appreciate a lot. What they do not know is that Vincent and Ida use human flesh to give that delicious taste to their meat. Vincent hunts down travelers using traps on the road, then Ida cuts their vocal cords so that they cannot scream for help and they bury them up to their necks in his secret garden, and every now and then he harvests some of his victims to prepare their meat. His naive younger brother, Bruce, is the local sheriff and does not suspect any of the murderous activities of his older siblings. When Vincent shoots the tire of a motorcycle on the road, he puts the rider, Boris Tulinski, in his garden and brings his wounded girlfriend, Terry, to the motel. He learns that the girl has no family and decides to take care of her in the motel. Terry becomes attracted by Vincent despite the crush of Bruce on her. When Vincent tells Terry that he will teach her how to prepare his smoked meat, Ida becomes jealous and tries to kill Terry. Bruce decides to protect Terry and soon finds out about the hidden secrets down on the farm.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Farmer Vincent Smith (Rory Calhoun) and his younger overweight sister Ida (Nancy Parsons) live on a farm with a motel attached to it in an unnamed Deep South state. It's called 'Motel Hello', but the O on the sign constantly flicks on and off (hence the opening title of 'Motel Hell'). Vincent makes smoked meats said to be the most delicious in the surrounding area. Vincent's secret is human flesh, and Vincent has the areas around his isolated motel strewn with various booby traps to catch victims. The victims are placed in a 'secret garden' where they are buried up to their necks and have their vocal cords cut so they cannot scream; Vincent keeps them in the ground, feeding them special food, until they are ready and then kills them. Ida helps, and seems to enjoy it, whereas Vincent seems rather calm and certain in his belief he's not doing anything wrong. Vincent even refers to the people he's captured as ""animals.""The movie opens with Vincent going out one night and shooting out the tires of a motorcycle a couple is riding on: The male (Bo) is placed in the garden, but Vincent takes a shine to the young female (Terry) and brings her to the motel to help her recover from her injuries, much to Ida's displeasure. The next morning, Vincent's naïve and mild-mannered younger brother Sheriff Bruce (Paul Linke), who, unlike Ida, is not aware of his brother's secret, arrives, and Vincent tells Terry that her boyfriend died in the accident and that he buried him: a trip to the graveyard shows a crude grave marker placed there by Vincent. Terry, having nowhere else to go, decides to stay at the motel.Most of the film consists of Vincent (with Ida's help) capturing more victims for his garden. One of the first on-screen victims is a local health inspector for Vincent's pigs who spies the hidden garden by chance, goes to investigate, and then becomes part of it. The next evening, a van full of drugged-up band members are driving past the area of the motel in which Vincent blows their tires out by laying out spikes in the road and captures them. At the same time, Vincent uses his folksy charm to woo Terry, much to Bruce's dislike, who tries to woo her himself without much success.Another night later, Vincent captures more victims by placing a pack of cardboard cows on the road. When a car containing two women pass by, one gets out and when she goes to move the cows, Vincent gases her. The other woman gets in the driver's seat and plows through the cardboard cows and attempts to flee. Vincent chases after her in his pickup truck in which a long car chase ensues. The woman in the car apparently faints from the stress of her terror in which her car goes off the road and into a nearby pond where she drowns. Meanwhile, Bruce attemps again to woo Terry by taking her to a spot overlooking a local drive-in theater where they attempt to watch a movie on the big screen only when Bruce overhears the other woman over his police car's CB radio attemping to call for help for she is being chased. Bruce tries to start up the car, but it gets stuck in the mud. Bruce ends up falling into a mud puddle attemping to push his car free.That same night, the mud-covered Bruce drops Terry off back at the motel where he questions Vincent and Ida about the mysterious chatter over the CB's and Vincent suggests that it was just teenage kids playing a prank. After Bruce leaves, a pair of swingers show up at the motel with a false ad that the motel is a swinger's paradise which is titled 'Vincent's Motel'. After putting Terry to bed, Vincent and Ida enter the couple's motel room where they gas both of them and add them to their back garden.The next day Vincent suggests he may teach Terry how to smoke meat. Terry is willing to tour Vincent's smokehouse in the back and adds: ""Don't worry. I have a cast-iron stomach"". Ida finds out about this and, jealous of Terry's hold over Vincent, attempts to drown her in the nearby pond (by luring her out there to play on inner tubes), but Vincent comes in time and saves her. This proves to be a catalyst for Terry, who tries to seduce Vincent (he stops her, claiming it would not be proper until they were married) and she then agrees to marry him.A few days later, Bruce, while 'walking the beat' in the nearby town, learns from the local preacher Reverend Billy (Wolfman Jack) about Vincent's upcoming marriage to Terry. Unhappy that he's ""lost"" Terry, Bruce drives down to the motel once he hears the news and bursts into Terry's bathroom to protest Terry's choice (and during his rant to slander his brother claims his brother has 'syphilis of the brain', which might explain Vincent's calmness towards murder and cannibalism), but Vincent appears and chases his brother off with a shotgun. Having decided to have the wedding tomorrow, Vincent, Terry, and Ida share a glass of champagne, but Ida drugs the champagne to knock Terry out so she and Vincent can prepare some of the garden victims (presumably for the wedding feast tomorrow).Meanwhile, Bruce, still angry over losing Terry, starts doing some detective work on a few strange things he's noticed and starts to feel that something is not quite right at his brother's farm. After looking around, Bruce finds a pond near the motel which is filled with dozens of abandoned cars from the various passerbys that Vincent has captured.Vincent and Ida kill three of the band members (by hypnotising them, then tying nooses around their necks, attaching the rope to a tractor, and driving the tractor to break their necks) and pull them out of the ground to take to Vincent's meat processing plant. However, doing so seems to loosen the dirt around Bo, as he begins to try to escape. Bruce sneaks back to the motel to try to rescue Terry, but Ida returns to the motel for a snack and overhears Bruce trying to get Terry to leave. Ida ambushes Bruce when he leaves the room and knocks him out, and then takes Terry at gunpoint to the meat processing plant. Meanwhile, Bo escapes and frees the other victims in the garden.Vincent, upset that his 'love' found out his secret the way she did, sends Ida back to the motel to fetch his brother, but the victims, having escaped (and in a nod to zombie films, have staggered around groaning and hissing due to their cut vocal cords), ambush her and knock her out.Terry tries to escape the meat processing plant, but the door is locked and Vincent sadly knocks Terry out with gas, and then ties her to a conveyor belt, apparently planning to kill her too. He is interrupted by Bo, who crashes into the meat plant via an overhead window and brawls with Vincent, but he is weak from being trapped in the garden for so long and Vincent strangles him.Bruce awakens, finds one of his brother's shotguns, and goes to the meat packing building/smokehouse himself, but finds that his brother has armed himself with a giant chainsaw (and placed a pig's head over his own as a gruesome mask). Vincent manages to disarm his brother, but Bruce grabs his own chainsaw and proceeds to have a violent duel with Vincent (later parodied in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2'), in the process turning on the conveyor belt Terry is tied to, sending her slowly towards a meat cutting blade. Despite suffering several wounds, Bruce drives the chainsaw into his Vincent's side for a mortal wound. Bruce frees Terry and then returns with her to his wounded brother, who gasps his final words, leaving the farm and 'secret garden' to Bruce, and then lamenting that his whole life was a lie and he was the biggest hypocrite of all (""My... meat... I... I... used... preservatives!"") before he dies.Bruce and Terry go to the secret garden and find Ida buried in it as revenge... head first! (Of the victims there is no sign of them. They seem to have wandered off somewhere, presumably getting help.. but who knows?)In the final scene, Bruce and Terry then head past the motel, while Bruce comments on how he had no idea what was going on and was glad he'd run away when he was eleven. Terry suggests they just burn the motel, claiming it's evil. The sign saying MOTEL HELLO finally fully shorts out, permanently darkening the O and leaving the title: MOTEL HELL as the end credits role."

When a normal American family moves into a beautiful old English house in a wooded area, strange, paranormal appearances befall them in this interesting twist to the well-known haunted-house tale. Their daughter Jan sees, and daughter Ellie hears, the voice of a young teenage girl who mysteriously disappeared during a total solar eclipse decades before...—Michael Ducharme <ducharme@escape.ca> The musician Paul Curtis travels to the countryside with his wife, the writer of child books Helen Curtis, his teenage daughter Jan Curtis and his young daughter Ellie Curtis, to visit an isolated house in the woods owned by Mrs. Aylwood. He rents the house and his daughters, who are sensitive girls, see something strange in the woods and in the house. Soon Jan learns that Mrs. Aylwood's daughter Karen has gone missing thirty years ago while playing blindfolded in the church with her friends John Keller, Tom Colley and Mary Fleming. Further, it seems that she is trying to contact Ellie and her while strange things happen.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The Curtis family looks for a house to rent in England while their patriarch Paul, a music composer, conducts an opera. The family is shown a secluded manor house owned by the eccentric Mrs. Aylwood, who lives in a small cottage on the property, set on the edge of a forest. While investigating the manor, youngest daughter Ellie Curtis is drawn to a bedroom overlooking the woods. Jan, the eldest daughter, looks out a window in the adjoining bedroom, and sees a blue glow in the forest as the window shatters. Mrs. Aylwood believes Jan is ""sensitive"" to signs, and decides to rent to the family.Jan feels that something horrible happened on the property and believes that someone is watching them from the woods, but her mother, Helen, dismisses the girl's concerns. However, the real estate agent reveals that Jan reminds Mrs. Aylwood of her daughter, who mysteriously disappeared many years ago. As the family moves into the manor, Jan carries a large mirror to the living room, and knocks over a telephone. After retrieving the phone, Jan looks back at the mirror, but does not see her own reflection. The glass cracks, revealing the image of a blindfolded girl wearing a white dress, and the mirror shatters.The next day, the girls visit a farm with puppies for sale, where they meet local teenager, Mike Fleming. In the barn, Ellie picks out a puppy while Jan and Mike talk. In a trance, Ellie writes ""Nerak"" on a foggy window, insisting it is the puppy's name. Mike's mother, Mary Fleming, approaches the barn and becomes upset upon seeing the name, which from the outside reads as ""Karen.""Later, at the manor, Jan waits inside while Ellie plays with puppy Nerak at the edge of the woods. After their parents leave for town, Ellie disappears and Jan finds her sister following Nerak. As they reach a pond, blue light flashes over the water and Jan sees a circle of blue beneath the surface. Another flash of blue light knocks Jan into the pond and a branch traps her beneath the surface. Mrs. Aylwood arrives and saves Jan from drowning.At Mrs. Aylwood's cottage, the girls learn that 17-year-old Karen Aylwood disappeared almost 30 years ago on the night of an eclipse. When Mrs. Aylwood discovered Karen was not in her room, she thought her daughter went to the pond, but Karen was not there either. The church bell rang and Mrs. Aylwood ran there, too, arriving just as a blue light struck the building. Three of Karen's friends, John Keller, Tom Colley, and Mary Pierce, ran screaming from the church as it caught fire. Mrs. Aylwood raced inside to save Karen, but she was not there. Karen's body was never found and the other teenagers did not know what happened, saying only that Karen was blindfolded as part of a game. Mrs. Aylwood admits that she hears whispers in the wind, and believes Karen is still in the woods.Another day or two later, the Curtis family attends a local motorbike race in which Mike Fleming competes, and Jan climbs onto a rock for a better view. Ellie plays with Nerak on a nearby sand-pile, but suddenly demands that her sister join her. A collision on the track starts a chain reaction and, as Jan reaches Ellie, a motorbike crashes onto the rock where she just stood. Ellie insists that Nerak wanted Jan to move.When Mike drives Jan home, she tells him about Karen's disappearance. She wonders aloud if Karen was murdered and still haunts the area. Jan mentions Karen's three friends, and a surprised Mike admits that his mother's maiden name is ""Pierce"" and that Tom Colley is a hermit living in the woods. Mike confronts his mother, who claims the teenagers were playing a game designed by John Keller when a summer storm arose and lightning struck, setting the church on fire. While three of the friends escaped, Mary believes that Karen ran away because it is the only logical explanation. Later, at the manor, Ellie shows Jan a viewer with which they can watch the eclipse that Saturday.The girls go horseback riding with Mike, but their horses spook and run off in two different directions. Mike chases Ellie, who is saved from death when a flash of blue light causes a truck driver to swerve off the road. Meanwhile, Jan's horse runs to the church, bucks her off, and runs away. Inside the church, a blue light flashes on a coffin and Jan sees the image of a blindfolded girl. She closes her eyes for a moment and the girl is gone, but a man appears. He chases her outside until she runs into Mike. As the man escapes, Mike realizes the stranger was Tom Colley. Jan leads Mike inside the church and a wind suddenly blows, shattering stained glass windows, and two disc-shaped shards, one bearing a solar image, fall into overlapping circles.That night, Tom visits John Keller's mansion and claims that he saw Karen alive in the church. Although Keller orders the hermit to remain silent on the subject, Tom wonders if Karen is back from the grave to haunt them. When Jan attends a carnival with Mike, she sees images of Karen, blindfolded, in the house of mirrors and mouthing ""help me"".Feeling Karen is trapped somewhere, Jan vows to discover what happened that fateful night. She visits Keller, but he refuses to speak. Jan finds Tom's shack and, once convinced that she is not Karen's ghost, Tom reveals that they were initiating Karen into their secret society on the night she disappeared. John blindfolded Karen and they encircled her, holding hands as they performed their ritual. In the middle of the ceremony, lightning struck and the bell fell. As Tom ran outside, he looked back but did not see Karen; she was already gone.Later, at Mrs. Aylwood's cottage, the old woman hears Ellie humming and brings out Karen's music box, which plays the same tune. As Jan shares the information gleaned from her conversation with Tom, a trance-like Ellie states that they must help Karen very soon. Mrs. Alywood believes Karen is speaking to them, but Ellie insists it is not Karen, and they must open the door. Ellie faints as her mother arrives. Despite the girls' protests, Helen insists on leaving, but the car stops working as they drive across a bridge. Jan forces them out of the car and off the bridge before lightning strikes and the vehicle falls into a ravine.The next day, Jan examines the eclipse viewer and realizes overlapping circles represent a solar eclipse. Jan telephones Mike and asks him to bring John Keller, Tom Colley, and his mother to the church before the eclipse so they can repeat the ceremony. Mrs. Aylwood learns of the plan and worries for Jan's safety.Inside the church, Jan takes Karen's place within the circle and orders Keller to repeat the ritual. Ellie enters, possessed by 'the Watcher'; a being from another dimension who exchanged places with Karen by mistake. The Watcher (speaking through Ellie) reveals that 30 years ago, the magnetic pull of the eclipse transferred their positions, but they can reverse the process with the same ceremony. Light and wind surround Jan, lifting her into the air, but Mike breaks the circle, grabs her, and they fall to safety as the eclipse occurs. Suddenly, Karen appears (having not aged a single day since time moves more slowly in the Watcher's dimension) and removes her blindfold as Mrs. Aylwood enters the church to welcome her daughter back home."

She picks out a bottle of wine from the pantry and it reminds her of the liquor bottle her mother held the night of the tragedy. After dinner, Willy burns his mother's letter.That night, Lacey has a nightmare of being bound to a bed and gagged, and wakes in a sweat. She asks her husband for help. Lacey and Jake visit Dr. Warren (John Carradine), who hypnotizes her to be able to understand her trauma. She revisits the memories she has suppressed, but at the point where Willy kills her mother's lover, Lacey's voice becomes a series of guttural demonic sounds. Dr. Warren brings her out of her trance, and recommends that she visit her childhood home to confront her fear.After Lacey and Jake leave on their journey, Willy's nerves are rattled and he paints the mirror in the barn black. Later, Aunt Helen discovers that Willy has also painted the mirrors in house black. When she asks him why, he cannot give her an answer.A ""for sale"" sign is posted at Lacey's former house so the couple introduce themselves as home buyers to the three children in the house -- Jane (Jane Pratt), Susan (Lucinda Ziesing) and Timmy (David Swim). The house is bright and cheerful. Lacey enters the master bedroom, which is empty except for a mirror, casting the reflection of her mother's lover whose face is covered in a black stocking. However, no one is in the room with her, and she hurls a chair, smashing the mirror. Jake makes apologies to the children, and the couple leaves with the mirror frame and shards of broken glass.At home, Jake glues the mirror back together and hangs it on a kitchen wall. However, one shard of glass has been left behind, and the lover's evil spirit is released. The invisible spirit attacks Susan and forces her to gouge herself in the throat with a pair of scissors. Timmy's neck is snapped when he climbs in the bathroom window to surprise her. As Jane picks up the glass shard, it radiates a powerful energy and burns her hand. She staggers to the bathroom, releasing it in the sink and notices her sister's bloody body in the bathtub and brother's head jammed in the window. She washes the blood off her hands only to have the medicine cabinet door swing open and knock her unconscious. When the water hits the mirror shard it explodes and the spirit is apparently gone.When Lacey tells Dr. Warren about her visit, he assures her that now that she has smashed the mirror she has rid herself of the ghosts from the past. However, in the barn, Willy picks up a paper bag filled with mirror fragments and lets its contents fall to the ground. The energy from the fragments disturbs the reception on his radio. While his back is turned, the invisible evil spirit approaches with a pitchfork but Lacey appears and pushes Willy out of the way before he is hurt. Willy takes a pale of water and throws it over the mirror fragments, which burn. (It is revealed here to the viewers that water is the only way of stopping the evil spirit.)Jake suggests that Lacey take their son, Kevin (Raymond Boyton), fishing to calm her nerves. As mother and son leave, a shard from the haunted kitchen mirror pops off and attaches to the sole of Kevin's shoe. At the lake, the reflection from the shard causes the spirit to impale one picnicker in the throat with a barbecue skewer while in his car. When his girl friend climbs into the front seat, the spirit pushes her so that she is also impaled by the skewer.At the farm, Jake picks up a shard of mirror on the kitchen floor and can barely place it back in the mirror because of its energy. However, it is enough to convince Jake that Lacey released the lover's spirit when she broke the mirror. The family summons Father Reilly to the house, and as the priest places his hand on the kitchen mirror, it glows red and the lights in the room go out. When a scream is heard from the barn, Jake and Father Reilly investigate and find Uncle Ernest pinned to the ceiling with a pitchfork, and Aunt Helen strangled with a garden hose.Back at the house, Jake tries to call the sheriff, but the spirit cuts the phone line. Jake taps Lacey's shoulder to get her attention as she fixes dinner, and she spins around, wearing a shard of mirror on her eye like a monocle. As she snarls, ""get away,"" the shard's reflection burns Jake's face. Afterward, Lacey is about to attack Willy, but Father Reilly holds up a crucifix, and the evil spirit uses several kitchen knifes to attack Fathe Reilly. As blood pours from his head, the priest dislodges the evil shard from Lacey's eye. Father Reilly collapses and disposes of the mirror shard in the kitchen sink filled with water and the shard burs. Willy (speaking for the first time) screams out ""Lacey!""The evil mirror's spell over Lacey is broken, but with the evil spirit still haunting the mirror, and Jake and Willy cover it with a tablecloth and dispose of it down the well, which the water makes the mirror explode.Some time later, Lacey, Willy and Kevin visit Helen's grave, expressing relief that the farm has been sold and that they can leave it behind. Kevin jumps up and down to show his excitement and dislodges the single surviving mirror shard from the sole of his shoe. As Lacey, Willy and Kevin leave the cemetery, the shard glows red unnoticed in the grass..."

Dummar, who claimed to have received a will naming him an heir to the fortune ofHoward Hughes. This movie tells the possibly true story ofMelvin E. Dummar. Melvin is a nice guy, but he is a total loser: unlucky, impractical and can't keep a job. One night, however, he helps an old man who has had a motorcycle accident in the desert.

This life does wreak havoc on his marriage to Lynda Dummar, the two who live in a trailer park in the Nevada desert with their daughter, Darcy. Their possessions are routinely repossessed as Melvin has no concept of repayment of debt, always spending on those things he wants whenever they solely have the down payment. Their marriage is also not helped by Lynda's larger focus on wanting to be a dancer in whatever means rather than be wife and mother. These issues lead to an up and down marriage for the two, with Darcy often thrown between parents at a whim. One day, while Melvin is managing a gas station, he receives anonymously what looks to be the handwritten last will and testament forHoward Hughes, no other will which has been discovered following his death. Melvin received this document as years earlier, he picked up who he thought was solely a drifter in need in the middle of the night in the desert, that drifter who claimed to be Hughes, which at the time Melvin thought was just the rambling of a crazy old man. This will bequeaths Hughes' estate to a handful of people, with Melvin's share being $156 million. Melvin's actions following receipt of the will and public reaction as the story hits the media further affect Melvin's life as the authenticity of the will is questioned.—Huggo When luckless dreamerMelvin E.

At night, Melvin Dummar (Paul Le Mat), a magnesium plant worker, stops by the side of the highway to urinate. There, he sees Howard huddled and shivering on the ground. He helps the man into his pickup truck, and says he should see a doctor. Howard refuses medical attention, although blood trickles from his ear. Howard asks Melvin to take him to Las Vegas, Nevada. Melvin makes small talk, saying he applied to work the graveyard shift at McDonnell Douglas, Northrup Corporation, and Hughes Aircraft Company, but was rejected. Howard says he might have helped Melvin get a job, and reveals that he is Howard Hughes, but Melvin does not believe him. Melvin sings an original song he wrote titled 'Santa's Souped Up Sleigh'. He teaches Howard the words, and then wants Howard to sing a favorite song, but he refuses. After being prodded, Howard hums 'Bye Bye Blackbird', and then sings the words.When they arrive in Las Vegas, Howard asks to be dropped off in a hotel parking lot. Before he leaves, he asks Melvin for money. When Melvin gives him the spare change in his pocket, Howard eyes Melvin as if to commit his face to memory, then says goodbye. After Melvin leaves, Howard tosses the change on the ground.Melvin returns to his trailer home, and makes love to his wife, Lynda (Mary Streenburgh). Later, she awakens and sees their motorcycle being repossessed. Lynda grabs their daughter, Darcy (Elizabeth Cheshire), and some personal items, and leaves Melvin.

The couple has a quickie wedding in Las Vegas, and relocate to Glendale, California, where Melvin gets a job as a milk deliveryman. Months later, Lynda gives birth to a baby boy.While the family watches the 'Easy Street' game show on television, Lynda tells Melvin that their car has been repossessed. Melvin is not too worried, but Lynda becomes a contestant on 'Easy Street' to win money and prizes for her family. On the show, she tap dances to the tune of 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction' and receives a check for $500.

One day, Bonnie receives a telephone call informing her that Melvin is one of 16 beneficiaries named in an alleged Howard Hughes will. Television reporters show up at the gas station, and interview Bonnie and her children while Melvin hides. Later, Melvin agrees to hold a press conference, and the media interviews anybody who knows Melvin.In a courtroom at the Las Vegas Clark County Courthouse, Melvin tells lawyers he gave the will to the church because he was afraid. The attorneys strongly suggest that Melvin's story about Howard is a lie, and Judge Keith Hayes (Dabney Coleman) says he will throw Melvin in prison if he tries to commit fraud. Under oath, Melvin claims he is telling the truth. After the hearing, Melvin's lawyer thinks he has a chance to inherit money, but Melvin thinks that most of the inheritance will be siphoned away by the federal and state government. He is not angry though. He is happy to have the memory of Howard singing his Christmas song.The movie closes with a flashback scene of Melvin recalling Howard asking to drive his truck. Melvin lets Howard take the wheel. As Melvin drops off to sleep, Howard drives and sings 'Bye Bye Blackbird'."

She doesn't really need to know why she has received these powers, although many others do. Some want to know the scientific reason for her powers. Others don't want her help believing it is the work of the devil. And others, like Cal Carpenter, a man with who she begins a relationship, ultimately believes she is the resurrection of Christ.

In 1890 Wyoming, James Averill is the Sheriff of Johnson County, which is largely inhabited by foreign immigrants. The wealthy cattle owners view the immigrant farmers as a nuisance and hindrance to them enlarging their own land.

Jim is returning by train from St. Louis bringing with him a beautiful new horse and carriage for his girlfriend. The train chugs through the magnificent wilderness, its engine adorned with large deer antlers.In Johnson County, local gunslinger, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken) who works for the Stockgrowers Association (the local organization of rich cattle ranchers), and dresses in fancy Eastern clothes, just like Jim, shoots an immigrant farmer named Michael Kovac in the chest because Kovac had killed a steer to feed his starving family.

Nate rides by a huge group of immigrants forging their way into the wilderness and shouts at them to go back where they belong.Jim's train arrives at the end of the line in Casper, Wyoming, where he and many immigrants disembark. Jim has a conversation with Cully the Irish station master (Richard Masur) who tells Jim how a citizen can't get an even break.

Billy Irvine, Jim's friend from Harvard, is the only member of the association who has moral qualms about the murders, but he is always so drunk no one pays him any attention.

Canton slaps him in the face for being a traitor to his class by siding with the poor but Jim hits him even harder and leaves.Jim heads off to Johnson County driving the horse and carriage. He sees the same poor immigrant woman who's husband was beaten in Casper and her young children pulling a cart to which is tied her husband's body. Jim offers to help her get the money back she paid for land. She says ""we farm our land."" That night, Canton hires even more gunfighters and mercenaries with the promise of $5 a day and $50 for each murder.In Johnson County, Nate has qualms about killing a young married man whom he prevents from killing a steer.

Jim goes to the hotel in which he lives. The hotel is run by John Bridges (Jeff Bridges). It is Sunday and the immigrants are in town. During a cock fight in the bar, Jim tells JB about the death list. Bridges is incredulous. Jim repeats Billy's phrase, ""in principle everything can be done."" Jim intervenes in a dispute between a big immigrant with a bandage on his head and a dapper little immigrant in a white suit with a boater hat. The little guy says that the big guy trespassed on his land so ""I take him by foot and my wife hit him on head with rock."" Everyone, including Jim, laughs at the argument. Jim breaks up the brewing fight.Jim goes to his girlfriend's place. She is the pretty young French brothel owner named Ella Watson (Isabel Huppert). The two go into Ella's room for passionate sex.

Later on, Jim and the head of the chamber of commerce, Mr. Eggleston (Brad Dourif) go to the army fort to ask for help in opposing the Association and its gunslingers. The cavalry men are playing baseball and the captain hurts his leg. As he sits the game out, he tells Averill that his orders are not to interfere in the activities of the Association. The captain gives Jim a copy of the death list -- Jim notices that Ella's name is on it.Jim returns to the brothel and tells Ella that her name is on the death list. He fights with Nate, who claims to know nothing about the list and points out that he has asked Ella to be his wife. Nate says: ""Jim ain't your friend Ella. He ain't nobody's friend.""Nate takes Ella to his cabin. He shares the cabin with Nick Ray (Mickey Rourke) a young protégé of Nate's. Nick has invited Fred (Geoffrey Lewis) a dirty trapper to spend the night at the cabin. Nate shows Ella his big surprise: ""Wallpaper."" He has papered the interior of the cabin with what looks like pages from the Police Gazette to impress Ella. Ella says that the wallpaper is beautiful as Nate quickly tries to tidy the place up for his future bride.Back in Casper, Cully sees the train carrying the cattlemen and gunslingers heading off towards Johnson County without making the regular stop in Casper. He tries to telegraph Jim but the wires have been cut. Cully rides off on horseback to try to warn Jim about the danger.Frank Canton stops the train outside Sweetwater and the forces unload, meeting up with other members of the Association. Billy is drunk as usual but seems concerned that death warrants be issued. Canton assures him that the President himself has approved the murders. The cattlemen and gunslingers ride off into a cloud of dust. Billy utters the last lines of the first half of the film: ""What are we?""INTERMISSIONCully is found sleeping in the open country by the gunslingers. One of them questions what he's doing so far away from the train station when he should be there working. Cully tries to escape, but is shot down in a hail of bullets before he can warn anyone of Canton's thugs.At the cabin, the Trapper Fred shows Nate, Ella and Nick how you can keep a wolf from biting you by grabbing its tongue. Ella leaves in her carriage and returns to town, where the immigrants are having a meeting at the Heaven's Gate roller rink. Jim reads the death list to the immigrants and they realize that the whole community are included in Canton's plan. There is a hail of shouting and arguments and calls to raise a militia and fight the Association members.When Ella returns to the whorehouse, she finds the Association's men are inside. She sends John to get Jim then enters the whorehouse and tries to conduct regular business with the men. They viciously rape Ella. Jim arrives and sneaks on to the roof, seeing all the other prostitutes lying horrifically beaten upstairs. He slits the throat of their lookout before bursting into the house and shooting all but one of the gunslingers who attacked Ella. The gunslinger gets away by crashing through a nearby window. Nate arrives shortly after and realizes the type of people he has been working for.Nate goes to the Association encampment and shoots the remaining rapist who got away right in front of Canton and Billy. He threatens Canton and demands that the proper warrants are issued before any action regarding the death list is carried out. Canton says he has the full authority of the government of the United States in his actions, dropping the titles of people he knows high up. When Nick challenges Canton about his ability to kill a man, Canton shows his own resolve by shooting a young immigrant prisoner through the head.Jim once again tries to convince Ella to leave, but she still won't. Jim says goodbye to Ella. He is having a last drink with JB when the mayor and his people arrive and say they want Jim to turn the immigrants on the death list over to the Association. Jim quits as sheriff.Trapper Fred leaves Nate's cabin to have his yearly bath when he meets the gunslingers, hiding at the riverbank. Canton says Fred and the other occupants of the cabin have one minute to gather their things and get out before they attack Nate. Fred comes out with his stuff and is immediately shot down. Ella comes to the rescue on her cart and shoots one of the gunslingers, but is forced to flee on horseback when her carriage is wrecked. The gunslingers continue to attack the cabin, shooting hundreds of rounds, killing Nick. Nate shoots back, but the cabin is set on fire. Nate pens a last note to Ella. He comes out shooting in a daring last stand but is quickly killed.Back at the roller rink the immigrants decide whether to fight. They learn that Averill has quit, but Mr. Eggleston gives a speech about the rights of poor people, inspiring the townsfolk to take up arms. Ella runs in and says ""they're here!"", then goes to see Jim who appears indifferent to the news that Nate has died. He knew this day would come and, from his window, Averill watches on as Ella joins the immigrants who leave on their carriages to attack the Association head-on.An immigrant carriage plunges off of a bridge and an entire family is drowned while the husband howls. The immigrants, led by Ella and JB, ride around the Association's encampment, forming a circle. The gunslingers return fire and a chaotic battle ensues. Through clouds of dust and gun smoke, the Association kill off many of the immigrants. As bullets fly, a drunken Billy sees defeat and begins to reminisce about his time in Paris. He is shot dead by Ella. Canton escapes to get help, leaving the gunslingers under the command of former Civil War major Wolcott (Ronnie Walker). After many losses, both sides withdraw from the battle.Averill, who has now changed his mind, goes to join the surviving immigrants. He finds that Ella has returned to Nate's cabin and has found Nate's note: ""Goodbye Ella and Jim, if I never see you again. Nathan D. Champion"" Jim tells Ella to go back to her place and wait for him. He then goes to the immigrant encampment and devises a plan of attack, which he had learned from the Romans. That night, the immigrants use the remnants of their horse-drawn carts and logs from the surrounding forest to build mobile barricades whilst the Association men only hear their singing.In the morning, Jim rides around the field of battle and issues commands to the immigrants, who push their wheeled barricades towards the Association encampment. The bullets from the Association shooters are mostly unable to penetrate the logs. Recognizing Jim's plan of attack, Major Wolcott says ""Goddamn Romans!"" Pushing closer and surrounding the encampment, the immigrants use sticks of dynamite to penetrate the Association's defense. Some immigrants are caught by gunfire and one man's legs are crushed by the wheels of the barricade. He is shot by his wife who later shoots herself. Canton escapes to gather more forces. It looks like the immigrants are about to win. Wolcott is killed. Suddenly, Canton arrives with the cavalry and the American flag bravely flying (and clearly focused on) to arrest the remaining Association members. But as Averill remarks, they are being rescued instead of arrested. With Johnson County having fallen into anarchy, the order is given to pull out of the battle. The battlefield looks like Brady photographs of Civil War battlefields with hundreds of dead bodies and dead horses littering the scene.Back at JB's cabin, Jim and Ella are dressed in their Sunday best and prepare to leave Johnson County. They say goodbye to JB who is wounded from the battle. Just as they are about to get into a carriage, Association men begin shooting at them from nearby bushes and kill Ella and JB in a hail of bullets. Jim shoots and kills Canton but it is too late to save Ella and he can only weep over her body.1903, Newport, Rhode Island.Jim, now an aging man dressed in an elegant sailing outfit, watches a sunset from the deck of a steam yacht. Down below we see a pampered-looking woman sleeping on the sofa. She is the girl Jim danced with at the Harvard graduation. She wakes only to say ""I'd like a cigarette"" and idly lays there as a wordless Jim lights one. There are no more words spoken as Jim dwells on his lost love and the genocide of his townspeople. Averill returns to the deck and stares out at the water as the story closes."

During their time together, the volcano erupts and most of the island's population are wiped out. Tiny and all of Hank's workers are killed in town when a tidal wave crashes onto them. Sam takes Mona and two of his girls, Delores and Marsha, and escapes by car, while Hank and Kay rescue Nikki and some others at the stables by helicopter. The only survivors are those at Shelby's hotel, overlooking a disaster that will surely come straight for them, as the volcano is spewing fireballs. A fireball lands at the hotel - Conti is blinded in the explosion, to Fendly's horror. Some of the hotel guests panic and try to escape by stealing the helicopter, but it soon crashes, killing all those inside.Hank insists that everyone must evacuate the hotel and journey to a safe side of the island to await rescue. However, Spangler convinces the majority of the guests to stay, including mistress Iolani. Shelby bids a farewell to Nikki, who insists on staying with her husband. After one final attempt to persuade others to join them, Hank and Kay leave the hotel with Shelby, Brian, Rene and Rose, Fendly and Conti, Sam, Mona and the girls, plus a few more guests. At the hotel, Nikki stumbles upon her husband's affair with Iolani, but now it is too late for her to follow the others though Spangler expels her from the hotel.Trucks carrying survivors manage to travel as far as a mountainside gorge which a rockslide has blocked the road. Everyone must cross the gorge on foot. Conti is guided by Fendly, and the two become friends. From there, the party comes upon a rickety wooden bridge over a river of molten lava. Hank crosses first to see if it is safe. The others go in pairs. Two native children, whose father died crossing the gorge, are afraid and run away. Rose, who had stopped to rest with Rene because of her weak heart, dies after telling her husband to find the children.After an explosion beneath the bridge causes Sam and Marsha to fall to their deaths into the lava, Rene hoists a child onto his back and recreates his old tightrope act in getting the child safely across. Hank guides the second child to safety. The survivors take refuge in a cavern, during which time the volcano fully explodes and fireballs streak across the sky. Spangler gets his comeuppance when one huge fireball arcs directly towards the hotel; when it hits, the hotel explodes, killing him, Nikki, Iolani and all those who had unfortunately chosen to stay. The survivors (fearing they're the only ones left on the island) continue on toward a beach to wait for rescue."

"Those Lips, Those Eyes",1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081625/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Stagestruck adolescent learns about love the hard way while interning in Cleveland summer stock during the early '50's. Cleveland 1951. Pre-med student Artie Shoemaker dreams not so much of a medical career but a life in the theater, against the wishes of his working class parents. Despite having no experience in the theater whatsoever, he is hired as the props man at the Kempton Hills Park Theater, an open air venue that is part of the summer stock circuit. The resident leading man at Kempton Hills is Harry Crystal who, along with some of the other more experienced company members, is working toward more lucrative and higher profile acting jobs. For most, including Harry, the goal is back to Broadway. For some, that Broadway dream is more a delusion than a true possibility. Despite being a bit of a divo, which grates on many of the other crew members, Harry takes inexperienced Artie under his wing both in terms of guiding him through his current position in props, as well as a general life in the theater. Part of that general life includes romantic couplings, the person who Artie ultimately chooses, and she too chooses in return, is the lead dancer named Ramona. Artie's experiences with both Harry and Ramona over the course of the summer stock season shows him if he really wants a life in the theater and if Ramona truly is someone who will be part of his future as he initially envisioned.—Huggo The Kempton Hills Park summer theatre in Ohio is in full swing in the summer of 1951, and Harry Crystal {Frank Langella} is applying his makeup and getting into costume for the evening's production of ""The Red Mill."" As he prepares to put on his hat, he plucks a love note from it, slipped inside by an admiring member of the dance troupe. During a musical number, he chats with the dancer who sent the note, then as she takes the stage, he slips the note to another dancer.Also watching the action onstage rather than off is Artie Shoemaker [Thomas Hulce], and he has stars in his eyes. A job opening for a prop man has come up, and Artie has promised Mr. D'Angeli [Anthony Mannino] that he'll let him know for sure the next day if he'll accept the position. At home, his kid brother can't believe that Artie would take a job for which he isn't qualified. Besides, Artie is starting summer school to take his second--and last--shot at passing pre-med comparative anatomy before he might actually need to think about another career instead of becoming a doctor as his parents hope, but Artie thinks the morning course won't interfere with the rest of his day.On the first day of anatomy class, the students are introduced to the fish which will be their guide to learning anatomy, and receive a hefty first night of homework. Still Artie accepts the job, D'Angeli gives him the tour of the backstage storage and happily hands the duties over. Unfortunately Artie's first attempt at furniture building is a disaster, so D'Angeli tells Artie to gather the hand props for the actors to use during rehearsal.The backstage crew, run by jock Cooky [Marshall Colt] let Artie join them while they watch the rehearsal and gawk at the dancers warming up nearby. The directer, Sherman Sprat [George Morfogen] stops the script reading the minute one of the actors produces Artie's prop pencil and calls Artie to task. The prop list said a pencil, Artie explains, but Sprat says he doesn't want a ""pencil"" but a PENCIL. Artie is clueless, and he follows Sprat back to the prop room where the director verbally rips apart all of Artie's work. Harry steps in and manages to win the new kid a reprieve from being fired, then gives him a crash course in Stagecraft 101. First, there are 3,500 people who need to see the props, Harry advises, so a pencil should be an oversized dime store version or even a ball bat with a point on it, just as long as it is big. Harry goes over some other pointers (use ginger ale for champagne, put water in ashtrays to douse cigarettes onstage), then assures Artie that he is qualified enough for the job since he doesn't know what he's doing.Artie meets a dancer, Ramona [Glynnis O'Connor] when she comes to him looking for a lost part of her costume. He mentions that he has seen her hanging with Cooky, but she tells him to not believe everything he sees. During the performance, the stagehands pull a trick on Harry when Artie is occupied with other props, and glue a wine bottle and glass to a table before it's brought onstage. Artie finds the crime, but he can't clue Harry in on time. Harry still covers the joke up by ripping the items from their places to finish the scene, then smiles at a panicked Artie back in the dressing room, telling him the actors and crew are always at odds. After the show, Harry asks Artie if he has picked up a dancer, since it's a known fact that they all boff, but Artie goes home alone and sits with his brother in the kitchen. Before he can crack his anatomy book, the phone rings and Harry tells him to come to Caruso's, the local bar; Cooky and Ramona have broken up, so at Harry's urging, Artie strikes up a conversation with herCooky is steamiing mad and picks on Harry for wanting the public phone in the bar to be kept open for an incoming call he is expecting. Harry's agent, Mickey Bellinger {Kevin McCarthy], should be calling soon to come see Harry in the show and possibly send him to a bigger gig in New York, but Cooky snidely notes that the phone calls from Harry's agents over the years never seem to come. Harry calmly responds by asking Cooky and the guys what their dreams are, then he starts talking passionately about the great actors he has seen and admired. Suddenly he clutches his chest, and the others watch with concern as he quotes Shakespeare in what may be his dying words. . .until he pops back to life and flips Cooky the bird.Artie and Ramona have left the bar and he drives them to a make-out spot behind his fraternity house, but she backs out, apologizing that she just feels too old for such things, but there may be a better time later. The next morning Artie falls into a sleepy stupor at anatomy class and can't respond to a basic question from the teacher. At his father's job, Artie sorts delivery tickets and tells the old man (Jerry Stiller) his class is a breeze. How can he breeze by classes without opening a book, his dad asks. Artie says that when he finds he can't handle both jobs, he will quit. Meanwhile, his brother is receiving help with Latin, and his tutor Dr. Fuldauer [Herbert Berghof] has taken a job at Kempton Hills as a night watchman after learning about Artie's theatre job. While the dancers rehearse, Spratt insults Ramona as she works to perfect a step that is troubling her, remarking on her being from New York and supposedly above the summer stock crew. She braves the verbal assault, and the rehearsal continues.During the performance of ""Rose Marie,"" Harry hides behind some scenery and breaks out a screwdriver while Cooky and the crew aren't looking; when it's time to move the set they hook up tow ropes to the hardware, and when they pull they fall flat on their backs because the screws have been loosened. Just before Harry takes the stage for his song, he hands Cooky the tool and then taunts the guys at every opportunity while onstage. After the show, Artie presents Ramona with a giant paper flower to cheer her up, and they spy Dr. Fuldauer sitting in a prop throne reciting his own favorite Shakespeare lines.Fibby Geyer [Joseph Mayer], an aging actor whose career is on the downswing, comes to Harry's dressing room and asks for a loan so he can go to Cleveland to audition for a role in a radio soap. Harry happily writes him a check, then locks himself in his room for a self-pity party rather than join the others at Caruso's that night. Artie and Ramona take a walk outside the bar, and Ramona confesses that she doesn't care enough to allow Sprat to get under her skin. Artie is smitten with her, and she asks when he can find them a place where she can make him a ""man of the theatre.""The next day everybody is waiting for Harry to appear so rehearsal can start, and Sprat is furious. Artie finds Harry at Caruso's by the pay phone, having found Bellinger in the office and determined to get a callback. Harry angrily tells Artie that he has already wasted precious time in his career having served in the Army, and he doesn't want to wind up like Fibby or living out his best years doing road show tours. Artie begs him to not get himself canned, and Harry realizes the kid has gotten lucky: he passes Artie the key to his place to flop after ""strike night"" when the entire crew takes down the sets for the ending production and build for the new one to open the following night.At the set striking, Artie helps the crew with abundant enthusiasm, knowing Ramona is waiting in his dad's truck for him outside, so he is shocked when his folks come to see him and find out what will keep him away from home all night. Harry again comes to the rescue, sweet talking Artie's mother. Dad, however, spots Ramona in the truck as they leave.The couple enter Harry's place, and when he glances at the mail on the kitchen table, Artie is surprised that Harry has somebody else living with him named Harold Krebs. Ramona sets him straight, telling him that Harry obviously changed his name for stage purposes and is taken aback to see how shocked he is by the revelation. Ramona undresses. As they prepare to make love, the phone rings: it's Bellinger, who plans to come to Thursday's show.Harry rehearses with the pianist, nervous about the pending visit, but Artie assures him that he will do well. As he leaves the theatre, his father pulls up in the truck and tells Artie to get in: he has gotten a letter from the dean that Artie is flunking out, and Artie confesses that he has dropped the course to get his parents a refund. He wants to go to New York to write plays instead, quitting school with one year left. He feels he understands people, and that is all he'll need. His dad is beside himself but tells Artie he hopes his son wins the Nobel Prize: he'll need it if he doesn't finish school first.Harry is congenial to everybody on Thursday night, stopping to greet Dr. Fuldauer a, whose granddaughter has visited backstage. At the performance of ""Vagabond King,"" Harry waits to spot his agent and becomes more depressed as the show goes on. Bellinger arrives at the last minute, and Harry spots him while his character is kissing the female lead, rejuvenating the end of his performance. As Harry prepares to find his entrance onstage for his big solo, there is none, so he takes a shortcut. Sprat yells at D'Angeli and the crew for not having an entrance, and Artie grabs a utility knife to cut a makeshift hole for the dancers to enter the stage, telling Sherman he's a prick.Backstage after the show, Bellinger tells Harry he will have second lead in a Shubert tour of ""Student Prince."" Harry asks him about a role back in town, but Mickey says there is nothing this season for him. He is, however, interested in meeting the lead dancer: Ramona. After Bellinger leaves, Harry goes on a rampage. Fuldauer is showing his granddaughter a cape, and Harry yanks it from her as he yells that nobody should be hanging around the backstage when somebody is trying to give a decent performance. Back in the dressing room, Harry sulks until Artie arrives, disheartened and disillusioned about his mentor. Harry puts on a flippant attitude and Artie leaves. He waits for Ramona in the truck, and she comes out in a daze, telling him she met with Bellinger and he has promised her a part in a Cole Porter show on Broadway. When he asks if the agent made a pass at her, since she was gone for a while, she says yes, but that he was just a sweet old man looking for a little life. He yells at her about the fact that he was going to quit school and go to New York to be with her, and she blurts out that she is a married woman and thought he really knew that already.Heartbroken, Artie returns home and tells his dad that he will quit the theatre at the end of the season. The next day, he refuses to even look at Ramona and is cool toward Harry, but when he realizes that Harry has moved on and will accept the new part Bellinger offered, he wonders about everything he has witnessed. Harry tells Artie that even Barrymore didn't do well every night, and he will keep trying. In fact, he has a new agent lined up already who can get him into places Bellinger can't. Artie is hooked on the theatre, Harry says, and if he quits now he will regret it the rest of his life.Onstage, while Harry sings, Artie stands backstage next to another dancer. They lock eyes as Harry brings another summer stock production to its conclusion."

They were last seen departing from the remote Columbian town of Leticia, which sits deep in the jungle on the border points between Brazil and Peru, to document the existence of cannibal tribes in the jungle. NYU's noted anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is assigned the task by the university to find out what happened to the conceited and over-confident film crew.In the jungles of South America, a group of Columbian soldiers, led by a balding Negro lieutenant, are on patrol when they stumble upon a group of natives engaged in a spot of cannibalism; eating human remains.

The Yacumo is in possession of a cigarette lighter, which Monroe confirms belonged to Faye Daniels. Monroe is assigned a guide, a Venezuelan named Chaco (Ricardo Fuentes), who explains to Monroe that a tattoo borne by the prisoner indicates that he is the son of a shaman and that the Yacumo are not really cannibals. The conclusion drawn by Chaco is that they were this far out from their village near Leticia, where they were probably indulging in a religious ceremony meant to chase evil spirits out of the jungle...white evil spirits.Monroe, Chaco, and another young guide named Miguel, with their Yacumo prisoner in tow, head off into the jungle, crossing a few streams, encountering the badly decomposed remains of Felipe, the guide of the Yates team, near their former campsite. A day or so later, the search party comes across a strange and savage ritualistic punishment for adultery where a Yacumo man hauls his bound wife to a riverbed where he sexually violates her with a phallic dildo and bludgeons her to death with it. Monroe, Chaco, and Miguel soon reach the Yacumo village, where they are met with fear and suspicion. After demonstrating their good intentions by releasing their captive, they are allowed to stay for the night.The next morning, Monroe, Chaco and Miguel set off on the next stage of their journey, deeper still into the jungle, towards the ultimate goal of the Yates team: to meet the feared Yamamomo tribe, also known as the Tree People, a Stone Age tribe that has had little or no contact with the outside world and still lives in the Stone Age. The Yamamomo are constantly at war with a rival tribe called the Shamatari, also known as the Swamp People. Monroe and his two guides see the Shamatari driving Yamamomo warriors out of their high-up trees by setting fires under them, after which the resulting smoke makes the tribesmen fall to the ground. Soon, they stumble upon a skirmish between some Shamatari and Yamamomo warriors. Monroe and his two guides intervene by shooting several Shamatari warriors, forcing the rest to flee and establishing themselves as allies to the Yamamomo. The Yamamomo tribesmen permit Monroe and his guides to stay, but treat them with fear and suspicion as did the Yacumo, which confirms to Chaco that the Yates team did something to stir up trouble. Despite the language barrier, Monroe becomes determined to find out from the Yamamomo what happened to the Yates team.The following day, Monroe gains the trust of the Yamamomo by stripping off his clothes and bathing in a nearby stream. A group of carefree Yamamomo women arrive to bathe with him and playfully splash around in the water, while Chaco and Miguel watch from the riverbank. After a few minutes, the Yamamomo women lead Monroe and his guides away from the river, into the jungle, and to a clearing, where they are introduced to a bizarre totemic shrine: the skeletal remains of the Yates team with their four skulls arranged in a ghoulish manner, confirming that the film crew is dead and that the Yamamomo have been trying to exercise the jungle of their spirits.Seeing the crew's film cameras and the silver canisters of film untouched by the Yamamomo, Monroe decides to use another psychological manipulation to gain access to the film reels. Monroe manages to manipulate the Yamamomo chief by showing him a cassette recorder, which plays the sounds of the Yacumo and other tribes chanting. The chief accepts the recorder as a gift and allows Monroe, Chaco and Miguel to partake in a ritualistic cannibal feast by eating part of the dead body of a Yamamomo criminal recently executed. The Yamamomo chief then allows Monroe to leave with the film canisters.Several weeks later, Monroe arrives back in New York, where he gives a TV interview about his experiences in the jungle and the death of the Yates team and states that the film reels recovered may prove the answer of what brought on the deaths of the Yates crew. Monroe meets with three NYU board executives, two men and a woman, who want him to review the film in preparation for a TV documentary to be shown as Yates's final work in the Amazon.Monroe is shown the Yates footage at an office, where the female executive introduces Monroe to Yates's style of filmmaking by showing him extracts from a film he made in Africa a year earlier entitled ""The Last Road to Hell"", showing archive films of firing-squad executions. At this point, Monroe sits down in the editing room to watch the raw footage of the last days of the Yates team. The Yates team is shown departing their hotel in Leticia to travel by plane several miles away to a point in order to hike into the Green Inferno and make contact with the legendary cannibal tribes. Monroe watches the arrogant and superficial film crew of Yates, Anders, Faye, Mark, and their guide Felipe hike into the jungle, traversing the same streams Monroe and his group crossed months later, and them bragging to the camera about the natural beauty of the jungle while they commit various and unforgivable atrocities against various kinds of wildlife. In one repugnant scene, Felipe and Anders catch a large river turtle; they haul it ashore at their camp, and proceed to hack it apart before cooking and eating it while the camera is still rolling. Later, they shoot at various birds and small mammals in the jungle for no reason, but then Felipe screams out when a venomous snake bites his foot. Anders and Mark, in desperation, hack off Felipe's leg in a vain bid to save him, but Felipe goes into shock and dies from the snake's venom, thus revealing how he died. Yates tells his team that they must continue on.Taking a break from watching the footage, Monroe then embarks on interviewing some of the Yates team's family members, some of whom tell Monroe little about the death of their relatives and a few of whom scorn them for the trouble they would stir up. As Monroe begins to realize with growing horror about what really happened to the Yates team months earlier, he proceeds to view the rest of the film: after the death of Felipe, Yates, Faye, Anders, and Mark head further into the jungle and finally make contact with warriors of the Yacumo tribe. For no clear reason, they shoot at the natives and then, upon entering their village, proceed to humiliate the natives by killing their livestock and burning their village to the ground, in which they intend to use the killing to stage a mock-up of a Yamamomo raid on their village. Several natives flee for their lives, while a few others are killed or burned alive by the sadistic Yates team. Then Yates, aroused by his murderous actions, has sex with Faye in full view of the frightened and bewildered natives while Andres secretly films it. In the film's most gratuitous scene, the team happens upon a ritualistic forced abortion and the clubbing death of the mother-to-be.Monroe tells the female executive, who also viewed the footage, against broadcasting it as he attempts to persuade the executives to abandon their plans to air the footage. But his requests fall on deaf ears, as the executives want callous sensationalism that the public needs to thrive on with the brutal footage, which will bring ratings to their company.The next day, Monroe's anxiety has turned into anger when he meets again with the three executives and tells them that he has viewed the final reel of the film and says that it is ""offensive, dishonest, and inhuman"". He leads the executives into a screening room to view the final reel: in it, Yates speaks to the camera, where it is days after their massacre of the Yacumo tribe; they are in a different part of the jungle, for the vegetation is different and there is no sign of the feared Yamamomo tribe. Suddenly, the group happens upon a young Yamamomo woman. Triumphantly and inexplicably, the men attack her, taking turns raping her while rolling in the mud of a nearby clearing; while one man holds her down, the other rapes her, and the third gleefully films the action. Faye tries to protest, but is held back by Anders. As Yates takes his turn to rape the terrified young woman, a Yamamomo warrior crouches in the grass yards away, watching the savage film crew's atrocities. The film then cuts to a riverside clearing, where the mud-covered Yates team find the same Yamamomo woman dead and vertically impaled to the ground with a 12-foot wooden pole exiting out of her mouth. Yates looks overjoyed and is told to look concerned for the camera. The epitome of hypocrisy, Yates talks about the profound disrespect the Yamamomos have for their women and that the woman was killed as a form of sexual punishment (it is not clear whether the woman was killed by her own people for being sexually violated by the Yates team, or if the Yates team killed the woman themselves in order to rig up this latest spectacular footage for their viewers back home). As a result of their actions, the vengeful Yamamomo emerge for a final 10-minute violent confrontation. In the jungle, the group is surrounded by dozens of Yamamomo warriors throwing spears and shooting arrows at them. Anders fights them by rashly shooting at several of them, while Yates (deranged to the end) continues filming, saying the footage is beautiful. Anders is felled by a spear as Yates continues filming. Anders' dead body is dragged away by the Yamamomo, where they castrate him, behead him and hack him apart before cooking his remains and eating them. Faye is next; she is grabbed by several Yamamomo warriors, where she is stripped, gang raped, and also beheaded and mutilated by the vengeful warriors. It is not long before Yates and Mark pay the price for their own indiscretions when the warriors spot Yates still filming them and attack. Yates is attacked and falls to the ground, his camera still rolling as it drops from his hands, capturing his own death in horrifying close-up. In a fitting touch of irony, the last thing which his dying eyes see is the same camera lens which he and his crew used to capture the images of death and mayhem...which, in fact, they were all responsible for.Back in the screening room, Monroe looks at the three executives, who look on with silent shock and disgust. Finally agreeing with Monroe's assessment at last, one of them orders that the film be destroyed and not shown. As Monroe walks out of the building and into the hostile concrete jungle of New York, he looks around at the people on the streets and mutters to himself, ""I wonder who the real cannibals are."""

Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, a ""changeling"", and took him to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure. Richard returned several years later with the impostor, now grown at age 18 and ""cured"" of his illness where they inherited the vast fortune and continued as if nothing had happened.Now, the ghost of the real Joseph haunts the house, making great efforts to persuade John to investigate his murder, and give him some form of justice.

Harold (Bob Hoskins), a prosperous English gangster, is about to close a lucrative new deal when bombs start showing up in very inconvenient places. A mysterious syndicate is trying to muscle in on his action, and Harold wants to know who they are. He finds out soon enough, and bloody mayhem ensues.—Marty Cassady <martyc@bev.net> Mobster Harold Shand (Hoskins) is the all powerful boss of the London underworld, who beneath a gentrified veneer is all snarl and menace. On one fateful Good Friday, the day Harold is to close a crucial deal with an American organised crime group, Shand finds his empire suddenly under attack. Somebody has killed two of his henchman, tried to murder his mother and blown his favourite pub to smithereens. And somebody's going to pay. A shady character, Colin (Paul Freeman -Raiders of the Lost Ark), carrying a suitcase of money pockets a couple handfuls of cash before making the delivery. In a country farmhouse the three men dividing the money in the case are attacked by gunmen. Outside a pub Colin's accomplices are abducted and killed. Colin is later murdered at a swimming pool.The leading gangster in the London underworld (Harold Shand - Bob Hoskins in his breakout movie role) is forming an alliance with a group of rich, shady Americans to fund the very profitable London docklands development of the 1980s.On Good Friday while Shand's mother attends church, her waiting driver is killed when her car explodes. The news of this is an outrage to Shand who is shocked at the declining code of conduct among the underworld. This decline parallels the decline of his empire throughout the film. He is given 24 hours to fix the situation or the Americans will walk away from the deal.Shand is further unnerved at the news of his friend Colin's murder as well as the discovery of a bomb (which fails to detonate) at his casino. He covers up Colin's murder, the car bomb, and the later explosion of a restaurant where he is about to dine. He frantically rounds up and coerces informants and underworld bosses in an attempt to discover who is behind these events and what they want. He is brutal but he believes his behavior is within civilized boundaries.Throughout he laments the decline of neighborhoods, respect for the church, respect for his power, England's economy, and honor among thieves. At the same time he professes to be appreciative of history, of what has been great about England, and is driven to build great things on the site of now idle dockyards.Shand finds out that the bombings are caused by the IRA in revenge for Colin's having stolen the relatively small sum of 5,000. We also learn that the three men from the farmhouse at the beginning were also IRA. The IRA has connected Shand to Colin even though Colin was moonlighting as a courier without Shand's knowledge. Shand's top man tells him there is no fighting the IRA as they don't care about money (""they're fanatics"") and that even if you kill them dozens more will always be ready to take their place. The IRA is taking over his empire and there is nothing he can do about it.In a last attempt to end the fight Shand meets with the IRA under pretense of paying them off with 60,000 but he murders them instead. However, the Americans walk away from the deal anyway, dismissing Shand as a gangster. Shand lectures them on how they have no guts or vision and that he will deal with the Germans instead and not be stopped by them. But Shand is abducted by the IRA as he leaves the meeting and his downfall is complete."

Cutshaw accepts an offer to give Kane his saint's medallion. Kane later notes about the curative properties of ""shock therapy"" and inspects Cutshaw's medallion and grips the chain.Fell wakes Kane from another nightmare and questions him about his dreams. Kane says that they are another man's nightmares, explaining that another man described the dreams to him and now he gets them as well. Fell asks who the man was, and Kane responds that it was his brother, who is a ""murderer"". Kane asks if Fell has heard of Vincent ""Killer"" Kane, a guerrilla soldier personally responsible for killing dozens of enemies. Kane says ""Killer"" Kane was his brother, but is now dead. Fell leaves, but as he closes Kane's door his jovial demeanor breaks suddenly into sobs.Later, Cutshaw talks with another patient about Kane. Cutshaw suspects that Kane is crazy himself. He asserts that psychiatrists often go crazy and have the highest suicide rate of any profession. Cutshaw goes to talk with Kane again, angrily denying the existence of a purpose or divine plan. Kane, who believes that the existence of a God is far more likely than humanity having emerged from ""random chance"", tries to argue that deeds of pure self-sacrifice are proof of human goodness, which can only be explained by divine purpose. Cutshaw demands that Kane recall one concrete example of pure self-sacrifice from his personal experience, but Kane cannot.Cutshaw convinces Kane to take him to a church service. Cutshaw interrupts the service with several outbursts. Looking at an altar boy, Kane momentarily sees a Vietnamese boy, but he dispels the illusion with difficulty. Back at the castle, Cutshaw thanks Kane and asks him to send him a sign as proof of an afterlife should Kane die first. Kane promises to try.Another patient named Lt. Reno (Jason Miller), who is staging a production of Hamlet using dogs as actors, gives a long speech to Kane asserting that Hamlet had to pretend to be crazy in order to stay sane. As he leaves, he meets with Cutshaw, who asks if ""they bought it"". The director responds, ""Hell, I bought it"".A new patient is scheduled to arrive at the castle and Kane goes to meet him. Kane instantly recognizes the soldier, triggering a flashback. In the jungles of Vietnam, the soldier stumbles upon Kane, who is kneeling on the ground and muttering that he cut a boy's head off with a wire, but the boy ""kept on talking"". Insisting that they need to leave, the soldier advances on Kane, whom he sees is holding a severed head in his hands. Kane screams and the flashback ends. In the castle, Kane collapses unconscious.Fell explains to the staff that Kane really is Vincent ""Killer"" Kane, and had suffered a breakdown in Vietnam. When Fell, who is actually Kane's brother Hudson, was dispatched back to America, Kane received the dispatch by accident. Kane came to believe that he was really his psychiatrist brother in order to escape from his guilt. He returned to America, subconsciously hoping to heal people to make up for his ""murders"". Realizing Kane's mental state, the Army psychiatric staff maintained the charade and sent him to Fell's hospital under the pretext of being its commanding officer. In reality, Fell has been the commanding officer all along. Kane awakens and remembers nothing of the incident.Cutshaw escapes the castle and visits a local bar. A biker gang recognizes Cutshaw and begins brutalizing him. A waitress contacts Kane, who arrives at the bar to retrieve him. The gang brutalize and tries to rape Cutshaw. However, Kane snaps and kills most of the bikers with his bare hands.Back at the castle, Cutshaw visits Kane, who has wrapped himself in a blanket. Dreamy and distant, Kane disjointedly mumbles to Cutshaw about God and proof of human goodness before passing out. As Cutshaw leaves, Kane's hand emerges from his blankets and drops a bloody knife. Cutshaw soon notices a spot of blood on his shoe. Returning to Kane's office, Cutshaw discovers that Kane has sacrificed his own life to directly provide the concrete example of human goodness which he was unable to demonstrate earlier.Some time later, Cutshaw has returned to uniform and visits the now-abandoned castle. He sits in Kane's office and reads a note written to him by Kane. Kane writes that he hopes his death will ""shock"" Cutshaw back into sanity, but at any rate, he now has his one example of pure self-sacrifice. Cutshaw returns to his car and discovers that a saint's medallion has miraculously appeared on the seat. He turns it over to confirm whether it was the one he gave to Kane and silently rejoices at what he sees."
Maniac,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081114/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychopathic man goes on a killing and mutilation spree in New York City. Frank Zito misses his mother, who was killed in a car accident years before. She was abusive to him, and made money selling her body, but Frank still misses her. He tries to keep her from leaving him, and reform her evil ways, by killing young women and putting their scalps on mannequins which he displays around his apartment. Photographer Anna D'Antoni takes a picture of him in the park, and he pursues and befriends her. Is she the one he has been looking for or just another mother wannabe?—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> A young couple are lying on a beach, being watched by an unseen man lurking on the dunes. The woman asks the man to fetch some wood for their fire. While he is gone, the unseen man approaches the woman and suddenly slits her throat with a razor. After gathering some driftwood from the surf, the guy returns to the campfire where the killer attacks him from behind and wraps wire around his neck and pulls, practically decapitating him.Sometime later, the killer, Frank Zito (Joe Spinell) sits up in his bed screaming. He lives in a small, one-room apartment which is full of bizarre paintings and artwork. There is a framed picture of a woman in a corner of the room decorated with candles and trinkets. There are a few mannequins in the apartment, one of which, wearing the beach girl's clothes and bloody scalp, is lying on the bed beside him. Frank takes off his pajama top and examines some old scars on his chest. He dresses, puts on a heavy winter coat, cloves, takes a gym bag, and leaves into the cold winter night of New York City.Somewhere in downtown Manhattan, Frank passes by a seedy hotel where two prostitutes are standing outside and one of them asks him if he would like a date. The two of them go inside and Frank checks into a room. In the room, Frank asks the woman if she ever modeled and tells her to show him some poses like the models in the fashion magazines. After she dances a little bit, the hooker and Frank kiss, and she relaxes him after he stops. When they resume kissing, Frank suddenly becomes angry and begins choking her until she is dead. He gets sick and throws up in the nearby bathroom and begins crying and asking ""why did you make me do that?"" In a very gory and nauseating sequence, Frank pulls out a utility razor and, very slowly and carefully, scalps the woman.Frank then goes home to his seedy apartment building somewhere in the Brooklyn region of New York. He is carrying a new mannequin to his basement apartment, and tells a passing tenant coming from the building that he is Christmas shopping. In his small one-room apartment, Frank wraps the plastic folding off the new mannequin, puts on the hooker's bloody clothes, and nails the bloody scalp to the mannequin's head, while hearing his own voice telling him that beautiful women whose beauty are crimes punishable by death. Frank pauses and looks at a newspaper headline detailing about the murdered couple at the beach.Sometime later, Frank dresses up to go out again, this time as a hunter. He disassembles a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun in a violin case, with some buckshot shells and the utility razor. He puts on his gloves, winter coat, and he tells the mannequins in the room that he will ""be right back"".Driving around the nighttime Brooklyn and the Queens area in his beat-up Buick Electra, Frank spots a couple outside a local disco getting into a car and driving off. The man (Tom Savini) and woman park in a lot beside the Brooklyn side of the Verrazano Bridge overlooking the narrows towards Staten Island. The woman from the disco wants to go home, but her pick-up date wants her to stay and view the sight. Frank pulls up near the couple's car, gets out and begins to spy on them as they climb into the back seat to make out with each other. The disco woman stops when she sees Frank by the car window. Upset, she asks the disco man to drive her home. The man climbs in the front seat, starts the car and turns on the headlights and Frank is standing right in front of them. He jumps on the hood of the car, and fires the shotgun through the windshield at the man literally blowing his head apart. The woman ducks in the back seat of the car as Frank approaches, points his shotgun at the woman and fires.Later, Frank is back in his room with another mannequin made to look like the murdered disco woman as he watches a TV news report about the latest double murder. Frank begins talking to himself and the other mannequins. He mentions stopping the fancy girls and he says they must stop or ""they'll take you away from me"". Frank then goes to bed and cries himself to sleep.In Central Park the next day, Frank is walking around when he stops a little girl riding on a bicycle near a playground who accidentally rides into him. He sees a woman (Caroline Munro) in the distance snapping a photo of him beside the little girl. Frank follows the woman, pauses to take a sneak peak at her bag and sees her name and address. The woman is Anna D'Antoni. Frank then walks off.Later that night, two nurses are leaving the Roosevelt Hospital after their shift and one of them mentions about a killer being on the loose. One of the nurses is picked up by her boyfriend, leaving the other nurse alone outside the hospital. Frank, standing nearby from across the street, begins to follow the nurse. She soon realizes that he is following her and she ducks into a nearby subway station. She gets through the gate, but when she arrives on the platform, the train leaves without her. Seeing Frank approaching, she runs and into a nearby restroom and hides in a stall. Frank walks inside, looks around, and after a minute of tense silence, leaves. The nurse comes out of hiding, looks around the empty and silent bathroom and calms down a bit. Happy that she is okay, the nurse walks to a sink to wash the sweat off her face but when she looks back up, Frank appears standing behind her and stabs her in the back with a bayonet, killing her. Frank washes the blood off the blade. Frank now has another mannequin resembling the nurse as he decorates up the figure while he is play-acting as a hairdresser.Some days later, Anna is in her darkroom of her apartment developing the photographs she took of Frank when the doorbell rings. Frank is at the door and tells her that he's the man whom she took his photograph in the park. Anna lets him in and they begin to talk about Anna's work as a photographer. He notes that all her models are women, and she tells him that she hopes to sell some of her photographs of the models. Frank tells her that she should keep them to preserve their beauty (it is implied, but never fully explained, that Anna might be a lesbian or bisexual due to her appearance and nature of her photography work). Frank asks Anna out to dinner, and she accepts. During dinner, Frank shows Anna a small photo of his mother in which he tells her that he and his mother lived in Queens until she died several years ago in an automobile accident. Anna reveals that she is from Italy but has done photography work mostly in England. Frank asks Anna if she would like to go out with him again and she invites him to an art gallery show for her photographs on Thursday.Another few days later, Frank arrives at a studio where Anna is taking photos of three models at a photography session. After taking a break, Frank gives Anna a teddy bear as a gift and she introduces him to one of the models named Rita. Anna and Rita go back to shooting, and Frank eyes the two women casually talking and holding hands together (again implying, but not fully revealing, that Anna and Rita's friendship is more then that). Frank impulsively steals a gold necklace that Rita set aside and leaves.Later that evening, Rita arrives home at her West End Avenue apartment, looks through her mail, and begins to run bathtub water to take a bath. Rita answers a buzzing at the front door and it is Frank who returns her necklace (claiming that he found it at the studio). With Rita distracted for a second, Frank slyly pushes in the door's lock, and leaves. Rita goes into the bathroom to take her bath. A little later, Rita is making tea for herself when she is grabbed by Frank who jumps out of a closet. When Rita wakes up, she finds herself gagged and tied to her bed. Frank then rambles at Rita saying that her hair is different, but he knew he could find her. He begins talking to her about abuse and leaving him, implying that he is talking to his mother. He tells Rita that he is going to keep her so she will never go away again. Frank then pulls out a switchblade knife and after a minute, stabs Rita in the chest, killing her. Frank then begins to scalp her as well and adds her hair and bathrobe as another trophy to his growing number of mannequins he keeps in his apartment. In his apartment, Frank sits in front of the woman's picture, which is his late mother, and talks about hiding in the closet when his mother said so.Some days later, Frank calls Anna and invites her to a show and picks her up. Anna thanks Frank for sending flowers and attending Rita's funeral. Frank drives Anna to a cemetery and says that he wants to put a reef of flowers on his mother's grave which she died on Christmas Day. At the cemetery, Frank lays the reef beside the headstone of his mother, Carmen Zito, and begins to cry. He says that Rita knew about him and he suddenly grabs Anna by the neck. Anna hits him and runs, and Frank chases her through the cemetery. Anna wounds Frank by jumping out from behind a gravestone and hits him in his left arm with a shovel and flees out of the cemetery. Frank screams out in pain and calls out ""Mother!"" Frank then begins to hear voices in his head and the voice of a young Frank. He is pleading with his mother not to lock him up in the closet. It is fully revealed here that Frank was abused and neglected by his own mother, leading him to go on this killing spree. Frank returns to his mother's grave and kneels at the headstone crying again until suddenly the rotting corpse of his mother bursts out of the ground and grabs him (shades of the movie 'Carrie'). But it was all just a hallucination, and Frank sits back alone at the grave and cries some more.Frank goes home to his apartment and lies on his bed with his wounded arm crying over his mother. As he looks around the room, the mannequins suddenly turn into the bloodied murdered women they represent and they all approach Frank with weapons they pick up off his table. In the most goriest and horrific scene, the mannequins/zombies attack him, one stabbing him in the stomach with the bayonet, one chops off his right arm with a machete, and two of them literally rip off his head from his body in a ghastly flow of blood and gore, splattering all over everything.The next morning, a police car arrives outside the apartment building where Frank lives. Two plainclothes police officers, having obviously been called upon by Anna, get out, pull out guns, and burst into Frank's apartment. They find Frank lifeless on his bed (with only a knife in his bloody stomach), with all the mannequins standing around the room. Apparently the whole supernatural event was nothing but Frank's horrible nightmare which resulted in him committing suicide. The two cops leave the room, and Frank continues to lie motionless on his bed... then his eyes open..."
Alligator,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080354/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pet baby alligator is flushed down a toilet and survives in the city sewers. Twelve years later, it grows to an enormous size thanks to a diet of discarded laboratory dogs injected with growth hormones. Now, humans have entered the menu. Ramon the alligator is flushed down the toilet as a baby and grows into a gargantuan monster by eating the corpses of laboratory animals that have undergone dubious hormone experiments, thus providing all the ecological and social subtext that one could possibly wish for, even if one doesn't normally go for films about giant alligators eating people left, right, and center--which is the inevitable and tragic result of Ramon's decision that the outside world looks rather more interesting than the sewers..—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> A teenage girl's pet baby alligator is flushed down the toilet by her animal-phobic father and it ends up in the city's sewers. Fast forward 12 years, and the alligator survives by feeding on carcasses thrown in the sewer that were used as test subjects for an experimental growth hormone and for anabolic formulas. Because of the effects of the hormones, the alligator has grown massively huge, with a thick skin and an insatiable appetite, and it begins devouring sewer workers that it encounters in the sewer.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com A baby alligator is flushed into the sewers. It survives for years undetected by feasting on dead animals that were exposed to growth formulas and unwary humans who have ventured into the sewers. After years of non-stop eating, the young alligator has transformed into a monstrous 36-foot-long creature with an insatiable appetite. Now it's up to a world-weary detective and a herpetologist to stop the beast from going on a rampage. The film opens with a little girl attending an alligator stunt show with her parents on a vacation in Florida. The crowd watches as people perform daredevil interactions with the gators until one of them gets taken by surprise and is mauled by one of them. The crowd responds with lurid fascination, and the proprietors of the attraction are selling baby alligators to the patrons. The little girl buys one and takes it home with her to Chicago, where she places it in an aquarium and names it Ramon. Her friendship with Ramon is short-lived, however, when her father flushes Ramon down the toilet in a fit of rage about something. Ramon emerges in the Chicago sewers intact.The film flashes forward 12 years later), where we meet a Chicago police detective named David Madison (Robert Forster), who is a cop trying to make good again after a bungled operation that left his partner dead. Human body parts start showing up in the city's water filtration systems, and Madison takes a young rookie down into the sewer to investigate for signs of foul play. While they are down there, they get attacked by the culprit: an enormous alligator is living in the sewers, presumably Ramon, now grown to a monstrous length of 36 feet. Madison escapes but his partner is killed by the gator, leading to more suspicion and the possible ruination of his career.He enlists the aid of Marisa Kendall (Robin Riker), a zoologist specializing in reptiles; she happens to be the little girl from the introduction, the one who was so interested in alligators and whose father flushed her pet down the toilet. At first she is skeptical and refuses to believe that an alligator could survive in the sewers of Chicago, but another victim disappears in the sewers, and his camera is turned up with photographic evidence of the monster.Madison links the mysterious activity in the sewer to a pharmaceutical company performing experiments with hormones. The company has been injecting dogs with serum intended to accelerate their growth. When finished with their specimens, mostly dogs that have been acquired by illegal means and killed in the process, they give the carcasses to a shady character who dumps them into the sewer. Hence, the alligator has been feeding on these dead dogs for years, consuming the growth hormones within them, and therefore growing to gigantic proportions.Eventually, the alligator, disturbed by all the sudden activity in its area of the sewer, emerges from underground and rampages through the city. Many people are attacked, and although Madison has been lambasted by the police force, he is out to get the alligator for revenge.The city makes numerous attempts to stop the gator, including a pompous big-game hunter they enlist to kill it. The plan backfires when the gator ambushes the hunter in an alley and eats him. In an ironic turn of events, the owner of the pharmaceutical company finds a black-tie event at his mansion interrupted by a visit from the monstrous gator, which attacks a number of his party guests and kills him in his own limousine.Finally Madison and Marisa enact a plan when the alligator makes its way back to the sewer; Madison follows him down there with a bomb, and Marisa stays topside to make sure Madison's exit manhole stays clear. Madison is almost killed when a woman stops her car right on top of the manhole and blocks his exit, but they manage to get him out in the nick of time. Ramon is blown to smithereens when the bomb goes off, but we see another baby alligator emerge in the sewer from a drainpipe, presumably flushed down there by another unfriendly owner."

Humanoids from the Deep,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080904/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Humanoid sea creatures start killing a fishing town's residents, and raping their women. It's up to the townsfolk and a visiting biologist to fight back and fend them off. Scientific experiments backfire and produce horrific mutations: half man, half fish, which terrorize a small fishing village by killing the men and raping the women.—Concorde - New Horizons (with permission). Tensions run high in the seaside community of Noyo when a controversial new cannery promises to revitalize the traditional fishing economy with new jobs, new industry, and a scientifically augmented salmon population. As antagonism intensifies, a series of attacks by mysterious sea monsters threatens all the people in the town.—mrosesteed In the Pacific Northwestern town of Noyo, many fisherman have their livelihood endangered due to a new salmon cannery being built which many of the townspeople support. Hank Slattery (Vic Morrow) and several others are for the cannery because it will make life more prosperous for them. Slattery is a racist and takes out his biased aggression on a local fisherman Johnny Eagle (Anthony Penya) who is against the cannery and wants to remain an independent businessman.In a fishing boat, a group of fisherman catch what appears to be some kind of monster in the netting of their boat. The young son of one of the fishermen falls into the water and is dragged under the surface by something unseen. Another fisherman prepares a flare gun, but he slips and shoots it accidentally into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy, causing the vessel to burst into flames and then explode; everybody onboard is killed. The explosion is witnessed by Jim Hill (Doug McClure) and his wife Carol, who begin to wonder what is going on here, especially when Carol's dog goes missing during the following night and the two of them find its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach.The next day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach.

Drake has come to conduct a scientific study of the local fish life and notices an unusual amount of chemicals has created mutations, large fish-like creatures that actually are in the process of mating with the female population of humans in the town.A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. It turns out that the murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experimentation with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon. The salmon escaped from the laboratory facilities into the ocean during a storm, and were then eaten by other, larger fish who proceeded to mutate into the brutally depraved humanoids who have begun to terrorize the village.At the climax, the humanoids show up in droves, relentlessly murdering the men and raping every woman they can grab at the annual salmon fest carnival. As a result, many of the conflicts that divide the people are overcome in the effort to band together to fight the monsters. Luckily, Jim devises a plan to stop the marauding beasts.

Saturn 3,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079285/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two lovers stationed at a remote base in the asteroid fields of Saturn are intruded upon by a retentive technocrat from Earth and his charge: a malevolent eight foot robot. Two lovers stationed at a remote base in the asteroid fields of Saturn are intruded upon by a retentive technocrat from Earth and his charge: a malevolent eight-foot robot. Remember, in space, no one can hear you scream.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In the distant future, single man and woman scientific team living on one of Saturn's moons to grow food for the starving Earth, have their isolation shattered when a deranged killer, masquerading as a visiting technology expert, arrives at their lonely outpost to take over their work and build a lethal creation: a super-intelligent eight-foot robot which later takes a murderous mind of its own. In the future, Earth is overcrowded and the population relies on distant bases to be fed. In the Saturn 3 station, Major Adam (Kirk Douglas) and the scientist Alex (Farrah Fawcett), who is also his lover and has never been on Earth, have been researching hydroponics for three years in the base alone with their dog Sally. Meanwhile, psychotic Captain Benson (Harvey Keitel) fails the mental test required to travel to Saturn 3 and kills his replacement, Captain James (Douglas Lambert), taking his place in the mission of assembling and programming the Demi-God series robot Hector to replace one of the scientists in Saturn 3. Upon arrival, the mentally disturbed Captain Benson becomes sexually obsessed for Alex. Then he uses an interface to link his brain to program Hector, but incapable to control his emotions, he transfers his homicidal tendency and insanity to Hector. Now Major Adam and Alex are trapped in the station with a dangerous psychopathic robot.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film opens at a space station in the vicinity of the planet Saturn. An announcer is paging Captain James (Douglas Lambert) as the ship he is piloting is leaving in just a few minutes. We see James enter a locker room where he starts to put on his spacesuit and we see another figure in a spacesuit lurking in the corner wearing a helmet so we can't see his face. James addresses the figure as Benson (Harvey Keitel). Benson has apparently just failed a mental stability exam and James is replacing him on this mission. Before James is finished putting on his suit, however, Benson straps himself down and opens the airlock venting the locker room. James is killed and his body flushed out into space. Benson closes the door and then takes James's place on the mission.Benson flies the ship through the rings of Saturn and lands it on a moon at the Saturn 3 experimental food station. It is a remote and isolated underground facility crewed by just two scientists: the older Adam (played by a 64 year-oldKirk Douglas) and the beautiful young Alex (played by a 33 year-oldFarrah Fawcett). Despite their age difference the two are happy as lovers.Adam and Alex escort Benson inside the facility. Despite their warm greeting, Benson seems cold. He tells them they are behind schedule on developing the new food sources that the over-populated Earth desperately needs. He has brought a new robot - HECTOR - that he will assemble and program to help speed the project. Once Hector is operational he will be so effective that one of the scientists will no longer be needed.When Alex and Benson are alone, he makes it clear that he is interested in having sex with her. She tells him she is exclusively with Adam and Benson responds that on Earth it is considered inhospitable to refuse his request. Alex, who was born in space and has never visited Earth, though she is curious about it, points out that they are not on Earth and continues to ignore his advances. He, in turn, tells her that Adam is ""obsolete.""Alex escorts Benson to his quarters where he tells her he will take a ""blue dreamer"" and get some sleep. Alex tells him she does not know what a ""blue dreamer"" is and Benson gives her a blue pill and suggests that she try it.Alex shows the pill to Adam who dismisses it is a sleeping/hypnotic drug used to keep people from going crazy in the isolation of space duty. Despite her negative reaction to Benson, the fact that he is from Earth and his description of the effect of the ""blue dreamer"" raises her interest. Reluctantly Adam agrees to try the drug with her one night (A scene was apparently filmed that shows their dream sequence, but it was cut from the final film. A still from this segment, however, showing Fawcett in a sexy, futuristic outfit, was widely circulated when the movie came out).Benson assembles the robot which stands 8-foot high and is extremely powerful. Benson can program the robot by connecting his own brain directly to it by a data port surgically implanted in the back of Benson's neck. Adam sees this and it concerns him as he believes that if Benson cannot control his thinking, improper thoughts will be encoded into Hector's brain. Later as we watch Benson training Hector we see him give Alex a lustful stare and Hector does the same.Lust is not the only thing that is transferred to Hector, but also Benson's propensity toward murder. After the robot is operational Alex finds that her dog, Sally, as been killed by being ripped asunder. The robot then grabs Alex and lifts her by her wrists into the air. Her screams attract Benson and Adam. She is able to persuade Hector to release her, but the robot then attacks Benson by dropping a piece of equipment on top of him. Adam at first wants to leave the trapped Benson for the robot to finish off, but then has a change of heart and rescues him. They all retreat to the safety of the communication room. There Adam waits till Hector needs to recharge and when the robot plugs in, he overloads it with high voltage causing it to collapse. Adam then orders Benson to disassemble the robot, pack it up and leave.Benson disassembles the robot, but Hector's brain is still active and during the night Hector commands the other simpler robots in the lab to reassemble him.The next morning, Benson storms into Alex and Adam's bedroom telling them he is leaving and taking Alex with him. A fight ignites between Benson and Adam. Adam gets the better of Benson nearly choking him, till Alex pulls him off. Benson then takes this opportunity to hit Adam over the head and drag Alex, clad only in a short, baby-doll nightie down the corridor toward his spaceship.He doesn't get far, though, as the reassembled Hector attacks him in the hallway. Alex escapes as Hector drags Benson's battered body away.Alex and Adam decide their best course of action is to try and escape the station in Benson's ship. Hector blocks their way until they set a trap for him in the lab by removing the supports beneath a section of the floor. Hector is toppled through the floor into the hydroponic pond below the lab. While he climbs out Alex and Adam don spacesuits and head out toward the ship. Hector is able to remotely detonate it before they can get on board, however.Back inside they hear Benson's voice directing them to come to him in the lab. When they arrive the find that the voice is really Hector's, who can duplicate any of their voices perfectly. Benson is apparently dead as Hector is now wearing his decapitated head as a hat.Hector knocks both Alex and Adam out and when Adam awakes back in his quarters he realizes that he has been fitted with a communications port on the back of his neck and that Hector has been probing his mind.Hector, using Benson's voice, announces that he is now running things and giving assignments. He orders Adam and Alex to come to the lab to clean it up. Adam sends Alex along and stops on the way to secret two explosive canisters and a detonator under his jacket. When he reaches the lab he challenges Hector for control of the station. When the robot comes after him he pushes both Hector and himself through the hole in the floor into the pond and detonates the charges killing himself and destroying the robot.In the final scene we see Alex on board a shuttle as it approaches Earth. She looks out the window knowing she is finally getting a chance to satisfy her curiosity about humanity's home planet."
Terror Train,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081617/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three years after a prank went terribly awry, the six college students responsible are targeted by a masked killer at a New Year's Eve party aboard a moving train. A college fraternity prank goes wrong and a student ends up in the mental asylum. Three years later, it's graduation time, and the members of the fraternity decide to have a costume party aboard a train trip to celebrate their graduation. Unknowingly to them, a killer has slipped aboard, killing them off one by one, disguised in the costumes of the victims.—Humberto Amador The college students Doc, Michelle ""Mitchy"", Mo, Alana, Edward ""Ed"" and Jackson plot a prank for their college mate Kenny Hampson; however the joke goes wrong and Kenny ends up in a mental institution. Years later, Doc and Mo decide to celebrate their graduation with a costume party and a magician aboard of a train. In the embarkation platform, Ed is murdered by a killer that wears his costume of Groucho Marx. Then he kills Jackson and wears his costume of The Swamp Thing. The conductor Carne discovers his body, but who might be the masked killer?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A large group of college students are at a bonfire for the New Year's Eve celebration. All of the pledges are wearing beanies, and one socially awkward taciturn pledge named Kenny (Derek McKinnon) is sent by the fraternity president Doc (Hart Bochner) and his friends up to a room in the frat house where a sorority sister named Alana (Jamie Lee Curtis) is waiting in the doorway. Alana walks inside the bedroom and stands behind the canopy in the dark room. Kenny undresses to his underwear, sits in bed, and realizes that he is sitting beside a bloated and rotting corpse. Kenny screams in terror and he stands up on the bed and is caught up in the canopy. Alana seems repulsed as Doc and a group of other students rush in and laugh at Kenny.Three years later.A large group of college kids are exiting a bus at a train station. They have a toast celebrating four great years at college as they prepare to board a charted old train for a New Year's Eve costume party. Carne (Ben Johnson), the lead conductor, has the students board the train while he organizes the route with the dispatcher. Carne helps a magician (David Copperfield) and his assistant carry their luggage on board, as a three-person band board the train for the excursion.Nearby, Ed (Howard Busgang) a prankster student and one of the ones involved in the prank against Kenny, walks around with a sword through his stomach. The other students laugh and think its another one of his practical jokes, but he falls down after the people walk away and board the train. An unseen person takes Ed's Groucho Marx costume and rolls his dead body under the train tracks. The train leaves and the lights at the deserted station are turned off. The killer is wearing Ed's costume as he moves around the train.Meanwhile, Mitchy (Sandee Currie) another one of the students involved in the prank against Kenny, is talking to Alana who is graduating early and hopes they will keep in touch.In the back of the train, the magician is talking to his blond assistant about the rowdy college kids and complaining about having to perform his illusions in front of them.In the lounge car, Doc is celebrating with his fellow frat brothers when one of them asks about the now abolished ""hog night"" and he mentions that something bad happened. Alana enters and tells them that they ""put a kid in the hospital"" who had a nervous breakdown due to Doc's prank three years ago. Alana then goes to her boyfriend Mo, also involved in the prank against Kenny, where they retire for some alone time.A little later, Mitchy sees 'Ed' and he follows her towards the sleeping berths. He nearly grabs her when Jackson, another of the students involved in the prank against Kenny, appears. Jackson is very inebriated and he offers 'Ed' a drink. In the nearby lavatory, the killer grabs Jackson, lifts up his mask for a second to let him see his face, and slams Jackson's head into the mirror. The killer then changes out of his Groucho Marx costume and leaves the lavatory.Meanwhile, Alana becomes angry when learning that the train party was Doc's idea after Mo told her that it was his. Two of the sorority sisters, Pet and Merry, show up where Pet thinks that her boyfriend, Ed, missed the train, and Alana argues with Mo about learning that Doc had set him up again. Carne, the conductor, shows Doc and Mitchy a car trick he learned form the magician (it is only a gag), and the couple waits for the occupied bathroom. After a few minutes, they leave to find another one.Later, the magician performs his show before the students and afterwards, the rock band appears to play. Alana talks with the geek class president (who was a pledge in the opening scene). Meanwhile, Doc asks Mo where Jackson and Ed are. Mo does not know and when he asks where did he find the magician, Doc says that he did not hire a magician for the party and wonders who did.Alana tells Carne that someone may have been left behind, but Carne tells her that the train platform was empty when he viewed it prior to the train leaving. Mitchy hears this and tells them that she saw Ed earlier on the train. Frustrated at being unable to find their boyfriends Jackson and Ed, Merry and Pet approach Doc and Mo who offer to take them to ""consulting rooms"" as they are both med students.Carne goes off to have a talk with Walter, the engineer of the train, and the stoker, nicknamed Shovels, to ask for the time to reach their destination. Carne then tries his card gag on Charlie, the brake master, who does not understand the joke.Afterwards, Carne then goes to the locked door of the lavatory and knocks on it, asking if there is anyone inside for it has been locked for some time. He unlocks it with his master key and finds a dead Jackson lying on the floor, with blood everywhere. Carne checks and sees that his neck must have been slashed and he quietly locks it again. Carne then tells Walter and Charlie what he found saying ""there's a boy dead back there"". After looking at a map of the area, they agree that the closest way out is straight ahead as the train is moving though rural and unpopulated wooded areas.Back in the showroom car, Mitchy mentions to Alana on the dance floor that she is leaving to be with Doc, and the magician, after looking at Alana, leaves in the same direction at Mitchy.Charlie arrives at the locked door to the lavatory and tells some girls passing by that it is out of order. Carne opens the door for him and the blood is gone and 'Jackson', wearing his alligator costume, is down on the floor moving. Carne thinks it was a practical joke and Mitchy walks by and leads 'Jackson' away.In Doc and Mo's room, Merry points out Kenny's photo in a yearbook. When Mo mentions about Kenny having a nervous breakdown, Doc yells at Mo not to talk about it, and Pet motions for Doc to keep quiet. Doc and Merry leave Mo alone with Pet.At the same time, Mitchy is with the killer still wearing Jackson's alligator costume, unaware of who it really is. Mitchy beckons him to join her in a berth bed as Merry and Doc walk by. Mitchy leans down and asks 'Jackson' to have her way with her. The killer takes off a glove and lays a hand on Mitchy's chest. She looks down and sees that it is Jackson's severed hand. She tries to scream, but the killer puts his real hand over her mouth.A little later, the magician approaches Alana and asks if she enjoyed his show, and he tries to woo her with more illusions such as the cigarette-through-a-quarter trick, and a levitating rose. Doc sees this and interrupts the conversation to tell Alana that Mo is waiting for her. Doc, for some reason, is not friendly towards the magician.Meanwhile, Carne finds one of Mitchy's shoes on the floor in the sleeping quarters and then finds Mitchy dead with her throat slit in one of the beds. He runs into Alana and asks her whose shoe he has. She goes to get Mo, but he ignores the knocking at his door for a rambunctious Pet is there with him. Carne gets Alana alone in the conductor car and tells her that Mitchy is dead and he shows her the body.The magician puts on a second show where he asks Merry to volunteer for some of his illusions. Doc continues acting in a rude tone around the magician and outright expresses skepticism to the show. After a few minutes, Doc sees Mo hanging his head out of apparent boredom and follows suit. When the magic show ends, Mo does not move or talk, and when Doc hits him, he falls over. Doc takes a closer look at Mo and sees that he is not breathing. Doc's screams for help are ignored by the crowd as they cheer for the magician and his assistant. Doc carries Mo through the train to Carne and Alana and they discover a large stab wound on his chest. Mo is dead.Finally aware that there may be a maniac killer on board the train, Carne checks the lavatory and discovers a bloodied rag that the killer used to clean up the mess after killing Jackson. Carne runs up to the engine room only to find Walter and Shovels both gone (only finding a bloody engineer's cap). Carne and Charlie pull the emergency breaks and, after a tense minute, stops the train. Carne leads the students off the train as he has the chief porter and several of his men look around the train for the killer. Outside, Carne has everyone take off their masks to get a look at all of them as the class president takes a roll call to see who is present.Alana suggests to Doc that the killer might be Kenny wanting to get back at all those involved in the prank against him three years earlier. She tells Doc that after the practical joke with the corpse, Kenny was taken away and when she went to the hospital psych ward later that night to visit him to apologize for the prank, the hospital staff would not let her see Kenny for he was being kept in isolation because they told her that Kenny had accidentally killed someone before when he was younger (either his mother or a female relative in a car accident). Apparently the site of the rotting female dead body triggered a total relapse of Kenny's mental breakdown and he is now getting revenge against all of those involved in the prank against him. Doc thinks that with Ed, Jackson, Mo, and Mitchy dead, they are the only two ones left involved in the prank and they might be next.Doc takes Alana to a room on the train and locks the doors. He shows her a yearbook and she sees that Kenny used to be a magician in high school. Alana wants to tell Carne about Kenny, but Doc refuses to let her leave. She gets out of the room and runs when a figure wielding an ax approaches her. But it is only Charlie the break master who tells her to go back outside with the others.Alone in the room, Doc checks every inch of the room from the lockers to the above berths. He sits down and then realizes that he forgot to check under the seats. He stands up and is grabbed by someone under his seat. He tries to escape, but a hand grabs his shoulder. He looks at the hand which has painted black fingernails and Mitchy's class ring. He settles down believing that Mitchy is joking with him. But the killer pulls out a knife and puts it to his neck and slashes his throat.Carne takes the students back onto the train and has them all packed into the dining room car to sort out who the killer is. With no phone or radio and no roads around, they will have to travel to their destination to find help. Meanwhile, the magician's assistant arrives back in the showroom car and tells him about a killer lurking among them, and he scolds her for wondering around and going outside.As Carne has Charlie restart the train and as it gets underway again, Alana runs up to him and tells him that she thinks the killer is the magician. They go to get Doc, and Carne enters the dark cabin room to find it splattered with blood and he finds Doc with his head cut off in one of the berths.Carne assembles a small group of train porters who arm themselves with fire axes and crowbars. They quietly enter the magician's showroom car where they herd his assistant and all of the students out, and lock the door. The chief porter takes Alana to a compartment and offers to look after her while she rests. Having assembled all of the students into the tightly packed dining room car, Carne and his men enter the showroom car, but the magician is nowhere to be found.In the rooms compartment, the chief porter is sitting dead in a chair... having been stabbed with one of the magician's swords. The killer is now wearing Mitchy's black robe and old man's mask costume and, taking the ax off the dead porter, quietly enters Alana's room and swings the ax at the covers, but it is only an inflatable doll. Alana, anticipating the killer would do just that, jumps out of a closet and stabs the killer in the shoulder with a sword. But the killer gets back up and chases her to the conductors car, but loses his ax when he swings and misses Alana and it flies out a window. Deprived of his weapon, the killer and Alana struggle with him trying to choke Alana. Alana sprays the killer with a fire extinguisher and takes refuge in a caged area with a desk. She locks herself in, and the killer arms himself with a crowbar and knocks out all the lights in the compartment and attempts to pry the lock. But Alana stabs him in the face with a letter opener, kicks the door open and runs out. The killer chases Alana and, during another struggle, falls between the train cars. Carne and his men arrive and leads the wounded and shaken Alana away, unaware that the killer is holding onto the side of the train car.Later, as dawn begins to break, Alana sits alone in the back of the train in the show room and upon looking at the magician's folder and paperwork, finds the magician dead in a box, impaled with his swords. Alana screams, and runs out past the students and goes forward to the conductors compartment at the front of the train to find Carne and sees Charlie sitting at his desk. She tells him that the magician is dead and doesn't know who the killer is anymore. But the figure grabs her hands and she looks up and sees a masked person wearing Charlie's uniform. The killer had obviously killed Charlie, removed his uniform, and threw his body off the train for the side car door is slightly open. Alana asks the killer who he is, and he removes his mask, revealing a pasty white-faced Kenny (complete with a wound to his left cheek where she stabbed him earlier). Kenny then takes off his cap, revealing.... flowing blond hair (a short subliminal montage reveals that Kenny was half the time in disguise as the magician's female assistant). Kenny takes off the blond wig, removes his false teeth and wipes off his lipstick and white powder makeup. Alana tries to apologize to Kenny for her involvement in the prank, but he tells her that he always had a crush on her. He tells her to kiss him for he feels that Alana owes him just that for the past three years, and she reluctantly obeys. Suddenly, Kenny has a similar eerie reaction as the memory of the practical joke with the corpse comes right back to him. Alana backs away and Carne enters from the engine room with a shovel and sees Kenny reacting to his encounter with Alana. Carne hits Kenny with the shovel, and he falls out of the moving train though the open side door while it is passing a bridge. Kenny falls hundreds of feet and lands (presumably dead) in an icy river far below as the train continues moving on."

She tells what happened and Peter invites her to go to Dunwich with him. Meanwhile in Dunwich there are weird deaths and Peter and Mary meet the psychiatrist Gerry and his friend Sandra to find out the grave of Father Thomas to close the gates of Hell before All Saints Day; otherwise the dead will raise and destroy the living. Will they succeed in their intent?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In New York City, reporter Peter Bell, following a lead, believes there's a story to be had regarding a seance that went awry. Although that specific story does not materialize, he does find another concerning the young woman, Mary Woodhouse, at the center of that seance incident, she who, during the seance, saw a vision of a priest who hung himself in a cemetery in a place called Dunwich. Theresa, the medium conducting the seance, informs Peter and Mary that her vision, according to the Book of Enoch, has opened a portal to hell for the dead to emerge, which, if not closed by All Saints Day a few days away, will overtake humanity, meaning its destruction by the evil dead. By the time Peter and Mary arrive in Dunwich, which they discover is in Massachusetts, they find that that destruction has begun, which some of the locals attribute to witchcraft, the talk of which which has pervaded the region for centuries, or to a young man named Bob.

We have this story seen through the eyes of two sorts of teams with the journalist Peter Bell and Mary, a girl who experienced a vision of the mentioned priest, in one hand and Gerry, a psychiatrist, and Sandra, one of his patients, in the other hand. With these four characters we are going to see a story that begins just with unusual and inexplicable things happening like the broke of a mirror without any logical explanation.

The police, led by Sergeant Clay, interrogate Theresa, but fail to heed her warnings of an imminent evil. Outside the apartment building, Peter Bell (Chirstopher George), a local journalist, tries to gain entry to the premises but is turned away. The following day, Mary is buried in a local cemetery on Long Island overlooking Manhattan and Peter visits her grave site. The gravediggers (Perry Pirkanen and Michael Gaunt) leave Mary's half-covered coffin at the end of their work shift and leave. Soon, Peter hears muffled screams as he reluctantly leaves the graveyard. Using a pickaxe, he frees the screaming woman from her premature burial, but with the pickaxe coming dangerously close to her head as it smashes through the casket lid.Peter and Mary visit Theresa where she warns them that according to the ancient book of Enoch, the events Mary has witnessed in her visions presage the euroption of the living dead into our world. The death of Father Thomas, a marked priest, has somehow opened a door through which the living dead can enter and the invasion will commence on All Saints Day, just a few days away.In Dunwich, Bob (Giovanni Lombardo Radice), a lonely youth with a bad reputation, wonders into a desolate, empty house. He finds a rubber doll which inflates itself. But before he can use it, the sight of a rotting babys corpse scares him away. At Junie's Lounge, the barman discusses recent events with two local men, Mr. Ross (Venantino Venanini) and Mike. Strange events have been occurring the last few days, and Mr. Ross is inclined to blame Bob. When a mirror shatters and the wall cracks inexplicably, the men leave, despite the bartender's offer of free drinks. Across town, Gerry (Carlo De Mejo), a psychiatrist, is in consultation with Sandra (Janet Agren), a neurotic patient, when Emily Robbins (Antonella Interlenghi), his 19-year-old girlfriend and personal assistant, arrives. She tells Gerry that she's on her way to meet Bob, whom she has been trying to help. After Emily leaves, Sandras pet cat, whom she has been holding through her session, suddenly scratches her badly on her hand, and huddles in a corner. That evening, Emily visits Bob at a disused garage, but unearthly groans scare him away. Emily is left alone when she faces the supernatural apparition of Father Thomas who smothers her with a maggott-covered hand.A short distance away, Rose Kelvin (Daniela Doria) and Tommy Fisher (Michele Soavi), a teenage couple, are making out in Tommys jeep near the vicinity when they too face the ghostly image of Father Thomas outside the jeep. With a powerful, mesmerizing stare, Father Thomas makes Rose's eyeballs bleed and she meets a ghastly fate by vomiting her entire guts out while Tommy watches, and he is immediately killed by getting his head ripped open by an unseen ghoul. The next morning, there is no sign of Rose or Tommy, while Emily's body is found at the garage. The local pathologist Dr. Joe Thompson (director Lucio Fulci), cannot make a clear assumption to how Emily died except from a heart attack caused by shear fright. After Dr. Thompson leaves the scene, Sheriff Russell finds a small puddle of black, worm-infested fluid nearby. Mr. Robbins tells the sheriff and Gerry of his suspicious about Bob. Meanwhile, Peter and Mary leave New York and embark upon their search for the town of Dunwich, as seen in Mary's vision.As All Saints Day approaches, the people of Dunwich suffer further ghostly visitation in advance of the Hellish outpouring.

The apparition of the dead Emily pays a nocturnal visit to her little brother John-John (Luca Paisner). At Sandra's house, the corpse of Mrs. Holden appears without explination on her kitchen floor. Sandra calls Gerry for help, and he tries to cling onto the possibility of a rational explination. But as soon as Gerry arrives, the body has disappeared as mysterious as it appeared. Investing noises upstairs in Sandra's house, the doctor and patient witness broken glass fly from a shattered window into the wall opposite. The wall bleeds before their eyes, forcing them to flee the house. Meanwhile, Bob has taken refuge at the Ross household in the garage. When Mr. Ross's teenage daughter finds him and tries to comfort him after he tries to explain whats going on outside, the rabid patriarch enters, and mistakenly assuming that Bob is trying to seduce his daughter. The vicious Mr. Ross kills Bob in a horrific way by impaling his head on a drilling lathe.The following morning, Peter and Mary follow a bland village priest's directions to the shunned village of Dunwich. Arriving at the graveyard, they begin searching for Father Thomas' tomb. Gerry and Sandra also arrive after following a trail there, and the two couples exchange stories about their recent events. They begin to become acquainted at Gerry's office when a sudden violent storm blasts through the window, showering the four with maggots.

Everybody believes that Marina is the target, but the Police Officer investigating the case, Chief Inspector Dermot Craddock (Edward Fox) isn't sure, so he asks Miss Jane Marple, his aunt, to investigate.—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> An American company arrives in Miss Jane Marple's (Dame Angela Lansbury) small hometown to make a movie. Among the cast is famous actress Marina Rudd (Dame Elizabeth Taylor).

At a reception, however, the secretary of the village organizing committee, Heather Babcock (Maureen Bennett), dies from a poisoned cocktail. The drink was Marina's, who had given it to Heather after she spilled her first one. There is already considerable tension between many of the characters, so there are many possible suspects. Jason Rudd (Rock Hudson), Marina's husband and the director of the movie, is having an affair with Production Assistant Ella Zielinsky (Geraldine Chaplin). Lola Brewster (Kim Novak)--Marina's hated rival and friend of Producer Martin N. Fenn (Tony Curtis)--arrives, having been given a small part in the movie. Miss Jane Marple (Dame Angela Lansbury) and her nephew, Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Dermot Craddock (Edward Fox), work together to solve the puzzle.—garykmcd Set in the fictional English village of St. Mary Mead, home of Miss Jane Marple (Angela Lansbury), in 1953. The movie opens with a black-and-white scene from a movie being played at the local community house titled 'Meeting at Midnight' where a detective in the movie assembles a group of people together at a quait country mansion to root out them for the murder of the wealthy owner. The film breaks which depresses the local audience, until Miss Marple reveals, according to her natural skill of observation, who the murderer in the movie is.Meanwhile, a big Hollywood production company arrives to film a costume movie about Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I with two famous movie stars, Marina Rudd (Elizabeth Taylor) and Lola Brewster (Kim Novak). Marina and Lola are old rivals who hate each other. Marina, who is making a much heralded comeback after a prolonged ""illness"" and retirement, when she, in reality, has had a nervous breakdown, and her husband, Jason Rudd (Rock Hudson), who is directing the movie they are making, arrive with their entourage. When she learns that Lola will be in the movie as well, she becomes enraged and vents her anger.Lola and her husband, Martin N. ""Marty"" Fenn (Tony Curtis), who is producing the movie they are making, then arrive at the gathering. Excitement runs high in St. Mary Mead, as the locals have been invited to a reception held by the movie company in a manor house, Gossington Hall, to meet the celebrities. Lola and Marina come face to face at the reception and exchange some potent and comical insults, nasty one-liners, as they smile and pose for the cameras. The two square off in a series of hilarious and cleverly written and performed cat-fights throughout the movie.After her initial exchange with Lola at the reception, she is cornered by a gushing, devoted fan, Heather Babcock (Maureen Bennett), who bores her with a long and detailed story about having actually met Marina in person during World War II. After recounting the meeting they had all those years ago, when she arose from her sickbed to go and meet the glamorous star, Babcock drinks a cocktail that was made for Marina and quickly dies from poisoning. The incident is unfortunate for Marina's mental state, and she is beside herself. Everyone is certain Heather was the intended murder victim. Once filming begins on the movie, Marina discovers that apart from threatening notes made up of newspaper clippings, her cup of coffee on the set has also been spiked with poison, sending her into fits of terror.A police detective from Scotland Yard arrives to investigate the case. Inspector Dermot Craddock (Bernard Fox) is baffled as he tries to uncover who is behind the attempt on the life of the actress and the subsequent murder of the innocent woman. The suspected are Ella Zielinsky (Geraldine Chaplin), Jason's production assistant who is secretly having an affair with him and would like Marina out of the way, and the hot-headed actress Lola Brewster. Inspector Craddock even suspects Marty Fenn may have have something to do with the attempt on Marina's life since he is Lola's blindly loyal husband.Inspector Craddock then meets with Marina who tells him about reciving the death threats against her in the form of two notes delivered recently and claims not to know who is behind them. When Inspector Craddock questions Jason about the notes, he clearly acts somewhat suprised as if hearing about it for the first time, and he calmly tells the inspector that he wanted to keep the threats on his wife a secret as not to bring on bad publicity for the Hollywood studio.Inspector Craddock asks his aunt, the renowned amateur detective Miss Jane Marple, who injured her foot at the reception and is confined to her home, for assistance. The main suspect, Ella Zielinsky, is later killed by a lethal nose spray after going to a pay phone in the village, where she called the murderer and threatened to expose them.At the climax, Miss Marple, now back on her feet, visits Gossington Hall, where Marina and Jason are staying, and views where Heather Babcock's death occurred. Working from information received from her cleaning woman, Cherry Baker (Wendy Morgan), who was working as a waitress the day of the murder, the determined elderly sleuth begins to piece together the events of the fatal reception and solves the mystery: Marina herself is the murderer.In the film's denouement, Miss Marple explains to Jason Rudd and Inspector Craddock about the two murders that have occurred. Heather Babcock's story was Marina's initial motive. Ten years earlier, Miss Babcock suffered from German measles; a rather harmless disease to most adults, but problematic for a pregnant woman. Heather Babcock innocently infected Marina when she met her during World War II during a stage performance. Marina was about a month pregnant at the time; the disease caused her child to be born with mental retardation. Upon hearing the unknowing Heather cheerfully tell this story, Marina was overcome with rage and poisoned Heather without thinking. She then spread the idea that she was the intended victim in order to throw off suspicion from herself, delivering death threats and poisoning her own coffee at the studio. Ella, who made phone calls to various suspects from the town's pay phone, accidentally guessed correctly, apparently prompting Marina to murder her as well. Miss Marple also deducts that Jason Rudd knew about Marina's murderous secret after Inspector Craddock told him the other day about the death threat notes that Marina received. Jason saw right through the charade as he realized that Marina fabricated everything because she never told him about the death threat notes, and thus decided to protect her.Jason, Marina's devoted husband, confesses to Miss Marple that he actually administered a dosage of poison just last night to save her from prosecution. However, when they enter Marina's room, they see that Marina is now dead. However, Marina didn't touch the hot chocolate Jason made for her and rather poisoned herself. As Marina is now dead, she will not be brought to justice. On that note, both Miss Marple and Inspector Craddock depart from Gossington Hall as the end credits role."
Atlantic City,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080388/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a corrupt city, a small-time gangster and the estranged wife of a pot dealer find themselves thrown together in an escapade of love, money, drugs and danger. Atlantic City is a place where people go to realize their dreams, the promise of the future manifested by the demolition of the old crumbling buildings to be replaced by new hotels and casinos. Someone who recently came to Atlantic City for that promise is native Moose Javian (Saskatchewan) Sally Matthews, who currently works as a waitress at a hotel oyster bar, but who is training to be a black jack croupier and wants to be more cultured, such as learning French, in order to work at the casinos in Monte Carlo. Another dreamer who came to Atlantic City decades ago is Lou Pascal, who has long worked as a numbers runner and who claims to have been a cellmate and thus implied confidante ofBugsy Siegel. Although Lou still dresses to the standard to which he is accustomed, his dream long died as he only works penny ante stuff for Fred, most of his current income from being the kept man of widowed recluse, Grace Pinza. Grace too came to Atlantic City to fulfill her dreams - most specifically to participate in aBetty Grablelookalike contest - and ended up staying, marrying a player named Cookie Pinza. Sally, Lou and Grace all live in the same soon to be demolished apartment building - Sally and Lou who are next door neighbors - although Sally knows neither of her neighbors. Lou, however, secretly spies Sally through their respective apartment windows as she goes through a daily ritual. The dreams of this collective are potentially affected - largely dashed or reawakened - with the arrival into Atlantic City of Dave Matthews, Sally's estranged, deadbeat husband, and his very pregnant new ageist girlfriend Chrissie, who happens to be Sally's younger sister. It is the unknown to Sally that Dave and Chrissie bring with them that affects those dreams, namely a large cache of cocaine stolen from criminal sources.—Huggo Dreams. Becoming an Atlantic City croupier will help Sally realize her dream of going to Monte Carlo, a symbol of the glamorous life that has been evading her since escaping from Saskatchewan a decade ago. Lou dreams that he was a great mobster in the old days. Grace came to Atlantic City for aBetty Grablelook-alike contest and stayed to become the wife of a mobster. A brief visit to Atlantic City by Sally's estranged husband will change the course of the lives of Sally and Lou.—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> The opening close-up shot shows a knife slicing lemons. The camera pans out to Sally (Susan Sarandon) washing herself with the lemon juice in front of the window at her kitchen sink in an apartment building in Atlantic City. She is listening to the operatic soprano aria Casta Diva from Norma. From the next apartment, an older man, Lou (Burt Lancaster), is spying on Sally as she bathes.We then cut to a phone booth. A young long-haired man goes in, pretending to make a call, then grabs something in tin foil. This is Dave. Another, tough looking guy with bleach blond hair goes in the same phone booth, obviously to get what was in the tin foil, but can't find it.We then see Dave hitchhiking with a young pregnant woman, Chrissie. They are both dressed like gypsies or hippies. in the background are the marshes of New Jersey and industrial smoke stacks. The two hippies walk through Atlantic City's boardwalk and go into a casino where they find Sally, who works in one of the casino's seafood restaurants. We learn the hippies are Sally's estranged husband, Dave, and her sister, Chrissie. The two had run off together. Sally says she's not going to let them stay with her, but relents.Lou passes them as they enter Sally's apartment. He goes downstairs to Grace's apartment, a woman about his own age who lives in an apartment with girlish pink decor. We find that Lou does errands for her for cash and that they have a combative co-dependent relationship.Back upstairs, Dave tries to kiss his estranged wife, Sally, who gives him the cold shoulder, telling him he ruined her chances of making a life in Las Vegas. He leaves angrily, but sees her purse and steals her wallet from it on the way out.Lou argues with Grace over five dollars. She tells him to steal it. Calling him king of the crooks. He takes the abuse calmly. He takes Grace's dog Peppie for grooming, and while there he asks the proprietress if she has any bets. We see Lou make his rounds as a small-time bookie.Sally is taking classes to be a blackjack dealer. We learn that she is taking French classes and her dream is to go to Monte Carlo and work there as a blackjack dealer.Lou brings the money he has gathered from bets to a man with organized crime connections, Fred O'Reilly, at a bar. Coincidentally, Dave is there to meet with Fred too, hoping to sell the drugs he stole from the phone booth pick-up. Lou watches Dave walk in the back with Fred. Dave shows Fred a plastic bag of white powdered heroin. Fred takes a sniff and says it's very nice. White Christmas. Fred tells Dave to get a leisure suit and lose the hippy look. Dave wants an advance. While Fred takes a piss, he tells Dave he can't do business with him. He gives Dave a card with a number on it, presumably a place he can sell the dope.
Dave chases Lou down on the Atlantic City boardwalk as he walks back to the apartment building. Dave offers Lou $100 to use his apartment for an hour.Lou returns Peppie the poodle to Grace, then leaves with Dave who asks to borrow Grace's scale. The two go downstairs and Dave cuts the white powder with baby laxative on Lou's kitchen table. Dave tells Lou he just turned $2,000 into $4,000. Dave asks Lou to walk him around, but Lou says he can't leave Grace. Dave has Chrissie go into Grace's apartment to rub her feet so that Lou will be free to show him around. As they walk the boardwalk, Lou tells Dave he knew Bugsy Siegel and that he killed people in the past when he worked for the people who worked for the people. He said he would swim in the ocean and come out feeling clean again.Lou and Dave go to a hotel. Dave says he wants Lou to go to room 307 and exchange the drugs for money. Lou asks why Dave isn't coming and Dave says he isn't dressed for it. While Lou is upstairs exchanging the drugs for money, and Dave is walking around. A car pulls up with Fred from the bar and the blond man from the phone booth from whence Dave stole the drugs. The blond man chases Dave into an elevated garage. A chase ensues ending when the blond man captures Dave and stabs him in the chest.Lou stops in a bathroom after collecting $4,000 for the drugs. He bumps into an old friend, Buddy O'Brian, who is now a bathroom attendant. They reminisce about a farcical mass rubber-buying job and Lou tells him he lives too much in the past. As Lou walks home he sees Dave being carried on a gurney into an ambulance.The police come into Sally's hotel and give her back her wallet. She asks where they found it and realizes something has happened to Dave and that it was he who stole her wallet. Sally rushes to the hospital and watches as they pull the blanket over the motionless Dave. When they tell her she can claim the body, she says she doesn't want it and storms out, past Robert Goulet singing a song about Atlantic City surrounded by chorus girls. He's at the hospital doing a benefit. After attempting to call Dave's parents, Sally walks past Lou who is at the hospital as well. He introduces himself as her neighbor and says he's sorry about Dave.
Lou helps her call Dave's parents, when she can't handle the call, Lou talks to them for her. After they get back to the apartment building they each go to their respective apartments. Lou again spies on Sally as she bathes topless at the kitchen sink, spreading lemon juice on her arms and bare chest.Lou goes downstairs to Grace's and sends Chrissie back upstairs. Lou puts on an old jazz record and climbs into bed with Grace who protests, ""Lou, whats got into you?"" But doesn't resists too much.The next morning, Lou follows Dave's procedure for cutting the drugs in his kitchen while whistling. He arranges for Dave's body to be sent to Dave's parents. He then goes back to the same client from the previous day and gets another $4,000. He visits O'Brian the bathroom attendant and gives him a large tip and tells him to visit a tailor.Lou takes Sally out to dinner. Hes wearing a new suit and pretends to be more wealthy than he is. Sally has to go to work on a house she and some friends are fixing up. Lou takes her. While there, Lou tells more of his history with Grace. That he's protected her for 40 years, since she was a teenager. But she got married along the way. Sally asks if Lou loves Grace. But Lou says he watches Sally. He then tells her, he's been watching her through her window, he then describes in loving detail her bathing ritual involving lemons and soap. Rather than being creeped out, Sally is touched and aroused. She takes off her blouse. And Lou delicately begins to run his hands over her. Presumably they make love (off-camera).As they return to their apartment building, they are accosted by the blond gangster who stabbed Dave. He rips Sally's clothes and breaks her radio and rifles through her purse, looking for the drugs or any proceeds. Lou is held back by one of the blond gangster's associates. As they come up the stairs Grace angrily confronts Lou and Sally, saying men had been ransacking the place. She is especially annoyed by Lou's new suit. ""What the hell are you wearing?"" She berates Lou and tells Sally in the old days his nickname was numb nuts.Sally's apartment has been ransacked. Lou, who has slipped into his own apartment, begins packing a suitcase. And with shaking hands gathers the remaining dope and a gun.Grace tells Sally it's not the first time Lou has run. He ran when her husband, Cookie, was killed, ""so he'll run away now"". Sally confronts Chrissie. She admits that Dave and she came to Atlantic City to sell some dope to get money for the baby. She tells Sally Dave went out with Lou the day before. Grace says, ""they took my scale."" She goes and angrily knocks and his door and sees that he's gone. Sally realizes Lou has been spending the drug money to romance her.Lou visits the client at the hotel and sells him the rest of the dope, except for a last $1,000 worth, since that's all the money the client has. He tells the client to tell Fred to leave the women alone, that what those hoods are looking for he's got.Sally goes to her blackjack dealing class, but is told the manager wants to see her. He says he can't afford to have people with connections like hers working in the casino. He fires her. Sally finds Lou playing blackjack in the casino. As she walks up to him, the blond gangster and his associate are asking him where the money is and they ask him to go outside. Lou won't leave the table. Sally yells at him saying he's playing with Dave's money. He tells her to sit down. She throws a fit. As Sally creates a scene and is forcibly thrown out by security, Lou slips out and gets in a cab.Sally manages to follow him to the bus station and tricks a bus driver into thinking he's her father and she needs to get him off the bus so he can get his medication. She demands that Lou give her the money. As they walk away from the station, the blond gangster and his associate corner them in an alley. The blond gangster holds a switchblade in Sally's face.Lou shoots both gangsters and he and Sally flee in their car. Lou is proud of himself and laughs about killing them."" I protected you"", he says. She tells him to put the gun down.They go to a hotel and order champagne. Their reverie is broken when they turn on the TV and see a news bulletin about the murders. But the news flash doesn't indicate that they are suspects. So they relax.We then see Grace and Chrissie connecting. Grace tells how she came during the war to Atlantic City for a Betty Grable look-alike contest, but the boardwalk was full of Betty Grable look-alikes. She offers to buy Chrissie a ticket home to Saskatchewan. Lou asks Sally to come with him to Florida where he has friends. She is leaning towards doing it. Then a police sketch of Lou is shown on the TV and Sally realizes it wouldn't work.In the morning Lou takes the telephone in the bathroom and calls Grace and admits the murders. He says he wishes Grace could be there. He is strangely proud and we realize he had never actually killed anyone before, contrary to what he had told Dave earlier on the boardwalk.While he's on the phone, Sally gets up and goes through his wallet. She takes most of the money. Lou peeks out the bathroom door and sees her doing this, but doesn't say anything. She makes up a story about wanting to get pizza, saying shell bring some back. As she's walking out the door, he tells her don't forget to ditch the car, indicating he knows she isn't coming back. She drives away, listing to a radio program about the wines of France.Lou asks for a taxi back to Atlantic City, looks at the paper the man was reading about the murders and tells the man that he did it. Grace sells the last $1,000 worth of dope to the client at the hotel, as she walks away, Lou takes her arm. They walk down the boardwalk together with smiles on their faces. The camera pans up to a wrecking ball slamming into a hole in a hotel being demolished as the end credits rolll."
Used Cars,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081698/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the owner of a struggling used car lot is killed, it's up to the lot's hot-shot salesman to save the property from falling into the hands of the owner's ruthless brother and used-car rival. Used car salesman Rudy Russo (Kurt Russell) needs money to run for State Senate, so he approaches his boss Luke (Jack Warden). Luke agrees to front him the $10,000 he needs, but then encounters an ""accident"" orchestrated by his brother Roy also played by Warden, who runs the car lot across the street. Roy is hoping to claim title to his brother's property because Roy's paying off the mayor to put the new interstate through the area. After Luke disappears, it's all out war between the competing car shops, and no nasty trick is off limits as Rudy and his gang fight to keep Roy from taking Luke's property. Then Luke's daughter shows up.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> The New Deal Used Car lot in Arizona is in danger of being taken over by the Roy L Fuchs car dealership across the roadway where they do business. Both dealerships are run by twin brothers, Roy L Fuchs and Luke Fuchs (both played by Jack Warden). However, Roy L's dealership is easily the more lucrative than his brother's, which deals in often junked used cars.One of New Deal's most prominent salesmen is Ruddy Russo (Kurt Russell), a young man who never shies away from making a deal, and also is planning to run for a seat on the State Senate. Along with Ruddy, there's Jeff (Garrit Graham), a superstitious fellow, and Jim (Frank McRae), the mechanic who is easily excitable.Recently, Luke has been having problems with his heart, much to the delight of his other brother. Roy L sends one of his mechanics over to the lot under the guise of an 'interested party,' and gets Luke to give him a test drive. However, Roy L's mechanic takes Luke on a wild ride during which Luke has a heart attack and dies.Ruddy, Jeff, and Jim try to cover this up by burying Luke in an old Edsel in a service pit out back. When Roy L and his lawyer Sam (Joe Flaherty) show up looking for Luke, Rudy explains that Luke drove to Florida in the Edsel. Roy L believes that Ruddy is lying, but Sam explains that there's no way to disprove this claim.Ruddy goes through with the first of several advertising stunts. Taking his camera crew out to a packed football stadium, they intend to hijack the signal for the football game to tell of their car lot. Things don't go as planned, when Jeff begins cursing on camera that the car he's standing by is red (he's superstitious about the color), and the woman they hired for the commercial ends up getting her dress ripped off on public television. The technique works, as the stunt makes newspaper headlines, and brings all sorts of people out to see the New Deal car lot.Roy L counters this with a little stunt of his own, but in the war to win customers, Rudy does one better, and steals away Luke's customers, by setting up a gaggle of strippers to entice vehicle buyers from Roy's lot. Roy counters this with purchasing airtime to decry New Deal's business tactics.It is then that Rudy plans to really up the stakes, and wants to try and interrupt the broadcast for the President's State of the Union address. Matters are further complicated when a woman shows up claiming to be Luke's daughter, Barbara Jane Fuchs (Deborah Harmon). Rudy attempts to get rid of her, but finds that he slowly is growing to like her.Rudy eventually distracts her during the night of the broadcast, by taking her to dinner, and then to his place. Jeff and Jim do the commercial, with Jeff hopped up on drugs as a cowboy named 'Martial Lucky,' who shoots out and blows up several of Roy L Fuch's vehicles for the commercial.After the broadcast, Roy L drives immediately to the New Deal lot and angrily picks a fight with Jeff for destroying his cars. As they fight, Roy L notices a picture of the service pit in an old picture, and remembers how Rudy and the others were filling it in. Roy L rushes out back, and after digging down a ways, finds the roof of his brother's old Edsel. Shortly after this, Jim contacts Rudy to come to the lot right away. Rudy does not explain to Barbara why he has to go, leaving her curious.In the morning, the police arrive at the lot along with Roy L and his lawyer. Rudy makes up the lie that Luke came back the night before, and went to get some breakfast. During the night, Rudy, Jeff and Jim exhumed the Edsel, and have moved it out of the pit area. Jim has poured gasoline on the vehicle, and sends it off with the accelerator on. As everyone's attention is drawn to the car, they watch as it speeds out of control towards a power transformers, that erupts in a fireball, destroying Luke's body.Roy turns to Rudy, and assumes that since Luke is dead, the lot is now his. However, Rudy explains how Luke's daughter returned, and she's staying with him. It is just then that Barbara shows up after listening to a message on Rudy's answering machine and finding out about Luke's death. Barbara fires Rudy, Jeff and Jim.Barbara then assumes control of her father's lot, but knows very little about advertising. Roy L gains access to the script for her commercial, and hires a man to doctor up her commercial. In place of her saying 'style of cars,' the word 'mile' is substituted for 'style,' making it as though Barbara has committed a case of false advertising.Rudy meanwhile, is still short the money he needs to run for the senate seat. However, during a football game, Jeff's superstitious nature causes Rudy to win a bet he made on the night's football game, and the next day, he meets with the party chairmen, named Tucker (Dub Taylor). However, on their way to their destination, the car passes by the New Deal lot, which has been closed by court order. Tucker explains that a 'concerned citizen' reported the lot after the commercial mentioned a 'mile of cars,' and that the trial is scheduled for the same day. Rudy immediately grabs back his money, and bolts from the car, heading towards the courthouse.Rudy makes it in time for the trial to start. As Barbara is questioned if she does indeed have a mile of cars on her lot, Rudy mimes in the back of the room to lie and say 'yes.' Barbara does so, to which Roy's attorney claims he can prove she is lying. Rudy mawkishly yells from the back of the room, ""Why don't you see for yourself, Judge?"" This buys Barbara some time, as the Judge decides to come by the car lot the next day.After the trial, Rudy uses all his campaign funds to purchase over 250 cars from a person he knows. Using the town's driver's education class, he sets out with all 250 cars headed towards the lot.Rudy has the drivers ramp their vehicles up to 70 mph, but hits a snag when a cop ends up hitting one of the vehicles, leaving them without a 'safety margin' for error. After the incident, Rudy sends Jim up ahead to scout for any other possible issues. Jim eventually finds a police roadblock, and Rudy has his drivers take their vehicles off road.Meanwhile, Roy L has heard of the cars, and drives out to try and intercept Rudy. A fight breaks out between the two, leading to Rudy winning, and the cars continuing to the lot. Eventually, they arrive, and fill the lot to capacity, just as the Judge arrives.It soon becomes apparent that Jim has not arrived. Rudy radios Jeff, who is sitting along the side of a road. Jeff explains that some water washed off the blue paint on his car...revealing it as a red Fire Chief's car...and per Jeff's stigma, he can't drive a red car! Rudy attempts to convince Jeff that there is actually 'gray primer' underneath the red paint, and tells him that he is the key to helping them keep the lot.Jeff manages to overcome his fear, and makes it to the lot just in time to help save the lot. Roy L curses out the judge, who then decides to see Roy in court for his outburst.The film then ends with Barbara, Rudy, Jim and Jeff presiding over their saved car lot."

He suggests that they hire mercenaries to protect the planet. Lacking valuable resources, they can only offer food and shelter in payment. Unable to go himself, Zed offers his ship, which has an artificial intelligence navigation and tactical computer named Nell, for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed but cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad (Richard Thomas), a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission.Shad's first stop is the Hephaestus space station, which repairs androids. Expecting to find weapons, Shad instead finds only two humans among the androids: Doctor Hephaestus (Sam Jaffe), whose life support has turned him into a cyborg, and his beautiful daughter Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel). The doctor attempts to force Shad to mate with his daughter. Shad doesn't want to abandon his people, and escapes, with Nanelia following in her own ship. Although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two separate to look for more mercenaries. Shad comes across Space Cowboy (George Peppard), a spacegoing truck driver from Earth who is ambushed by Space Jackers while delivering a shipment of laser guns to the planet Umateal. Shad fights off the Jackers, thus saving Cowboy's life twice over; they arrive at Umateal just before they watch Sador destroy the planet with his weapon. Lacking the fuel to carry the weapons back home, Cowboy offers to deliver them to Akir. Shad talks Cowboy into sharing his gunslinging experience with the Akira.Later, Shad meets a set of five alien clones who share a group consciousness named Nestor. They admit their life is incredibly dull, since their whole race shares one mind. In order to be entertained, they have sent five members to join Shad's cause. Nestor does not require payment, saying they are completely self-sufficient. Next, Shad recruits Gelt (Robert Vaughn), a wealthy assassin who is so well known he cannot show his face on any civilized planet. Gelt offers his services in trade for the ability to live peacefully hiding among the Akira. Gelt's ship is highly maneuverable and well armed. On his way back to Akir, Shad is approached by Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning), of the Valkyrie warriors. She is a headstrong woman looking to prove herself in battle. She pilots a small, but extremely fast ship with enhanced firepower. Shad finds her annoying and wishes she would go away, but she tags along.While waiting for Shad's return, Nanelia is captured by a reptilian slaver named Cayman. Cayman possesses a powerful ship with an eclectic crew of aliens. She quickly recruits Cayman to their cause when he learns that they are looking for mercenaries to fight against Sador. The only payment Cayman wants is Sador's head, since Sador's forces had destroyed Cayman's homeworld years ago. The fleet of seven ships return to Akir. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the heroes are greeted with caution by the natives, who are not used to violent species. Eventually, Sador returns, but his armada of attack fighters is intercepted by Shad and his hired warriors. In the opening battle, Gelt skillfully destroys several of Sador's ships but is mortally wounded when his ship crashes. Meanwhile, Cowboy and the Akiran natives, armed with his laser guns, fight off Sador's invading ground forces.Sador survives an assassination attempt by one of the captured Nestors and launches all of his ships in retaliation against the planet. The Akira ground troops, lead by Cowboy, defeat Sador's army, but Zed is killed in the fighting. There is another huge space battle and the mercenaries' ships are destroyed one by one. However, the mercenaries are successful in destroying all of Sador's star fighters and the Stellar Converter, leaving only Sador's flagship. Piloting Nell, Shad and Nanelia are captured by the flagship in a tractor beam. The pair escape in a lifepod after Shad orders Nell to activate the ship's self-destruct program. Sador's flagship is destroyed in the explosion. As Shad and Nanelia return to Akir, Nanelia despairs over the deaths of their friends. Shad tells her that the Akira believe that no one is truly dead when they have been dearly loved and remembered by the living. The Akira will remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries and honor them forever."

Outside, the freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn, and despite Ashland's best efforts, collides with the cruise ship, sinking it.The next morning, a handful of survivors, including Marshall, his wife Margaret (Sally Ann Howes), their children Robin and Ben, a young officer named Nick (Nick Mancuso), his love interest Lori (Victoria Burgoyne), the ship's stand up comic Jackie (Saul Rubinek), and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan (Kate Reid), are adrift on a large piece of wreckage.

Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is lifted and swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers the thrashing comic into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost.Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck.Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a disembodied voice speaking to him in German, telling him: ""This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!""

The only one who objects to this detour to the island (which Julie explains has only a few permanent residents, and only sees tourists a few months out of the year) is Carol, whose tarot cards convince her that something bad will happen if they go to the island.

Later, Michael is assaulted by the Ghouls and left paralyzed. John breaks the news to Michael's wife, Maria. After interrogating a member of the Ghouls while wielding a flamethrower, John learns the address of the gang's clubhouse.Arriving at the hideout with a rifle, John finds the three men who mugged Michael partying with prostitutes. As the women flee, John kills one of the men and beats the other two then drags their bodies to the basement and leaves them to be eaten by rats. When Detective James Dalton arrives, he learns that one Ghoul survived.Meanwhile, mob boss Gino Pontivini, the owner of the dock and meat packing plant where John works, is informed that Congress is suspicious of the rapid increase in beef prices. Although an investigation is imminent unless Pontivini lowers his prices, he is reluctant to give up his lucrative racket.Following up on the Ghoul case, Dalton arrests Candy, one of the prostitutes, and she gives him John Eastland's description. Visiting Michael in the hospital, John tells his friend that he avenged the attackers and confesses that the experience reminded him of Vietnam, where he felt no difference between right and wrong. John assures Michael that he has come up with a plan to provide financial support for Maria and their children.Later, John kidnaps Pontivini and hangs him above a meat grinder, threatening to reclaim the money he took in by exploiting men like Michael. Pontivini gives John his house keys and the combination to his safe. When John is attacked by a guard dog at the Pontivini mansion, he returns to the warehouse and lowers the gangster into the grinder.Meanwhile, Dalton visits the surviving Ghoul in the hospital and finds him unable to communicate, then takes Dr. Megan Stewart on a date. At the same time, a Times Square prostitute is abducted and tortured by two men. On the local news, the announcer reports Pontivini's murder and reads a note from ""The Exterminator,"" who takes responsibility for the mobster's death and states that more vigilante justice will follow. Concerned that the Exterminator's actions will make the government look weak as elections near, two CIA agents plan to kill him.Some time later, John is approached by the Times Square prostitute and he takes her to a hotel. When he sees her scars, she tells him about the Chicken Pimp, who punished her for refusing to participate in his child prostitution ring. John promises the girl that she will not be hurt again.

When Dalton arrives at the scene, he learns that the pedophile client was a well known and respected New Jersey Senator.Back at his office, Dalton receives an autopsy of the recently deceased Ghoul and a phone message from CIA Agent Shaw. Before he can respond to Shaw, Megan calls. Dalton tells her that the Exterminator suspect is a former soldier based on Candy's identification of his army-issue M-16 rifle. A footprint at the meat packing plant has been traced to hunting boots sold by a mail-order company and the police have isolated veterans from their clientele records.At a jazz concert in Battery Park, Dalton learns that Megan was an anti-war protester and reveals that he is a Vietnam veteran. Meanwhile, an elderly woman is mugged in Central Park by the Ghouls and John gives chase on a stolen motorcycle. He shoots one of the Ghouls dead at a stop light. When the others attempt to run him over, John shoots the driver and the car explodes and careens off a bridge. At the crime scene, Shaw introduces himself to Dalton and complains that the detective has been uncooperative. When Dalton demands to know why the CIA is involved with his case, Shaw warns that the Exterminator could be working with a foreign government to destabilize the United States during an election, but Dalton rebuffs him and calls Megan.While Dalton and Megan make love in a spare hospital room, John visits Michael and tells him that Maria has taken the money. He offers to disconnect his friend from his life support system and Michael agrees with two blinks of his eyes. An alarm sounds from Michael's room and Dalton sees John enter the elevator. When Megan tells him that Michael's respirator wire was cut, Dalton deduces that John is the Exterminator.Back at the police station, Dalton orders his associate to find a name on the list of suspects who was in the same battalion as Michael. Meanwhile, John tells Maria that Michael has died and when the police storm his apartment, they find it empty. Returning home on the stolen motorcycle, John notices the police. He calls his apartment from a pay phone and instructs Dalton to meet him in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He threatens to kill Dalton if he is not alone. Unknown to Dalton, the CIA is recording the call. Dalton arrives at the yard and follows John onto a ship. Although John holds Dalton at gunpoint, he fires over his shoulder and tells him that he only wanted the detective to know how victims feel. John surrenders his gun, but as Dalton approaches him, the detective is shot in the chest by a sniper and falls into John's arms. John tries to help him, but Dalton urges him to escape. When John climbs over the ship's rail, he is shot by the sniper and plunges into the ocean. Dalton aims at the sniper, but is shot again and killed.

He takes her locket as a trophy to another one of his many killings.Some time later, Alex is with his working-class friend Ricky (Giovanni Lombardo Radice), both of whom work in a local mechanic garage which is closing up for the evening. Alex is planning to go 'boogying' at a local disco and Ricky is tagging along. Suddenly, a large Cadillac vehicle pulls into the underground garage which contains a young, well-dressed yuppie couple named Tom (Cristian Borromeo) and his girlfriend Lisa (Annie Belle) where they ask for assistance for their car's motor is making strange sounds. Alex refuses to help them saying that the garage is closed, and continues to refuse assistance even after Tom offers him money. But the slow-witted Ricky decides to help the couple and upon checking under the hood, finds a loose wire on the alternator and fixes it. Grateful, Tom tells Alex and Ricky that they are driving to a friend's house in New Jersey for a party, and Alex asks them if he and Ricky could tag along, and Tom agrees. Before closing up the garage for the night, Alex stops by his locker which is filled with various knives he uses to kill people. Alex picks out just one; a straight-edged razor, before closing up and getting into Tom and Lisa's car with Ricky for the drive to New Jersey.A little later, the four arrive at a large villa situated next to a large, dark, empty park where they are welcomed by the home's owner Gloria (Lorraine De Selle), and are introduced to her friends Glenda (Marie Claude Joseph), and Howard (Gabriele Di Giulio). But minutes after Alex and Ricky's arrival, there are signs of tension as it becomes obvious that the rich people are looking for kicks, as are Alex and Ricky. It first starts when Ricky is forced to make a fool of himself when Gloria asks him to do a striptease to some disco music, while he is further humiliated by forced to drink some hard liquor with each move he makes. But Alex stops Ricky before he can take it all off.While Tom, Howard, and Glenda play a card game of poker with Ricky, which is obviously rigged, Lisa begins sexually teasing Alex with her come-ons, and goes further to invite him to an upstairs bathroom to shower with her, only to push him away. As Alex grows more frustrated and angry, he later sees that the hosts are cheating at playing cards with Ricky. Finally, Alex pulls out the razor he has, and a fight breaks out between him and Howard. Alex throws Howard outside the back door where he endures a vicious beating and thrown into the backyard swimming pool, and further urinated upon by the laughing Alex, who drags Howard back inside and ties him to a piano leg, while he proclaims that he is running the party now.At this point, the movie descends into an unrelenting catalogue of abuse and humiliation as Alex and Ricky further beat on their hosts-turned-hostages with Alex slashing Tom's face with the razor, and beating his face into the poker table. Ricky holds the others at bay with a wine bottle and Alex corners Gloria and sexually fondles her. Lisa runs to an upstairs bedroom where she tries to escape, but Alex catches her and proceeds to rape her.Afterwards, Alex further humiliates Lisa and Glenda when the front doorbell rings. Forcing Gloria to answer, the visitor is revealed to be Cindy (Brigitte Petronio), a local teenage girl asking Gloria for what is going on with the party since the loud music is gone and most of the lights in the house are turned off. Alex grabs Cindy, while Gloria takes advantage of this to try to escape. Ricky, still holding the broken wine bottle, runs after her. Ricky finally catches up with Gloria on the perimeter of the grounds where she appeals to the dangerous, but dull-witted man, to let her go. Appealing to the woman's sensitive nature, Ricky shows Gloria that he means her no harm by throwing away the wine bottle. For no clear reason, Gloria responds to his suttle nature by stripping off her clothes and seducing him!Meanwhile back at the house, Alex cuts Cindy's blouse off with the razor while singing. Ricky takes Gloria back to the house where she makes him promise not to let Alex hurt her. Alex then forces Cindy to strip off her clothes, and proceeds to savagely slash her nude body with his razor over and over again. At this point, Ricky makes the astonishing observation that things are getting a little out of hand and attempts to stop Alex. Upset at being ""betrayed"" by his friend, Alex turns against Ricky and slashes his abdomen wide open, and then breaks down at what a mess he made of Ricky.Taking advantage of this distraction, the blooded and battered Tom runs into the nearby study and pulls out a 9mm pistol out from a desk drawer... and the tables are instantly turned. Tom shoots Alex a few times, and includes a fatal wound to his groin which throws Alex back out the glass back door and into the back yard. Gloria and the other women untie Howard, and the five hosts descend upon the fatally wounded Alex lying on the ground.It immediately becomes apparent to Alex (and the viewers) that this whole thing was a set up by the hosts to lure Alex and Ricky to their house to kill them. Tom removes the locket Alex is wearing and reveals the reason for all this: the woman that Alex raped and murdered in the opening scene was Tom's older sister and Tom wanted revenge, so he and Lisa wanted to lure them to Gloria's house and taunt them so they can kill them and make it look like self defense. Tom kicks the fatally wounded Alex into the backyard swimming pool as he and the rest of his friends, with the exception of Gloria, take turns shooting Alex, who trashes weakly in the water, before a final shot to the head by Howard finishes him for good.Returning to the house, Howard wants to shoot Ricky still lying wounded on the floor, but Gloria stops him saying they they will instead turn him into the police. Meanwhile, Glenda tends to the wounded Cindy. Tom and Lisa go into the study where they talk about this plan of revenge they had and if they went too far for it to work. Tom says that despite some mistakes and inconsistencies, that it worked out for the best, and then picks up the phone to call the police."

Leslie apparently spends her life dazed and heavily medicated, while Dr. Gould is hostile toward the sheriff for no good reason. She accompanies him to the site of the abandoned bus, where she finds Tommy's things on board. When Hart departs, Joyce goes to walk home when she spots a figure standing in a nearby cemetery. She recognizes it as Tommy, just as it disappears among the gravestones. She rushes up into the cemetery, where she stumbles across the horribly mutilated body of the bus driver; he seems to have been burned from within his clothes, his flesh horribly charred and disfigured. Suddenly Tommy appears behind Joyce, his fingernails black. Relieved, she sweeps him into a reassuring hug, suddenly screaming in agony as her flesh begins to char. Tommy's hands are roasting Joyce alive, and her burnt body falls beside that of the bus driver.The five children have been transformed into smiling zombies by the cloud of radioactive vapors, intent on burning alive anybody who comes into their path. They move through the town, visiting their parents and families, most of whom are caricatures of bad parenting. Little Janet Shore's parents are swingers who don't even know or care where their daughter is. Paul MacKenzie's sister is a slutty blonde who is more interested in bedding the dopey town deputy. Cathy Freemont is pregnant with her third child, yet she still gives in to smoking in times of stress. John Freemont (Martin Shakar) joins the sheriff in the hunt for the children, trying to keep from Cathy that their daughter Jenny is among the missing children.John and Sherrif Hart find charred bodies all over the town of Ravensback, the handiwork of the children. Nobody suspects that the children are behind the deaths, and everybody makes the mistake of hugging the kids when they come across them. John and Hart make the connection about the killer children and John rushes home to protect Cathy and the youngest Freemont child, Clarkie, who escaped the cloud of poisonous gas because he was at home that day with a cold. Along the way, they encounter Janet Shore, who is dazed like the other zombies, but apparently still human--her fingernails are normal. They take her along in the back of Hart's squad car.Meanwhile at the Freemont house, the zombified Jenny attempts to return home, and Cathy joyfully rushes out to greet her, but John intervenes and Jenny scorches his hand before he can get away from her.John and Hart barricade the house and start firing on the children, who have congregated in the yard outside the house. Bullets have no effect on the zombies, which get back up and continue to walk around. While the adults are distracted, one of the killer children sneaks into an upstairs window of the house and fries Clarkie to death. It then tries to kill Cathy, but John attacks it with a sword, slashing out and chopping off its hands. It instantly dies, howling in pain.Armed with a machete, John hunts the children, cornering them in a barn, until he has hacked most of them to death. Unfortunately, he forgets about Janet Shore, whose fingernails have changed to black. She chars Hart to death, lurching at him out of the back seat of his car. John hacks Janet to death in retaliation.John is distracted by the cries of Cathy from inside of the house--the baby is being born. As the sun rises, the sounds of Cathy giving birth to her child fill the house. The baby is born and all seems well, until John notices it nursing at Cathy's breast, its fingernails black."

Shy, lonely Eric Binford delivers film cassettes and film-related supplies in Los Angeles for a living. But he really exists only to watch movies and immense himself in fantasies about cinematic characters and stars. Frequently bullied and betrayed, Eric comforts himself by pretending to be one of the many tough heroes and villains who have captivated him from the silver screen. However, his sanity takes a turn for the worse and he launches grotesque murders all patterned after characters and incidents from his beloved movies. He becomes known as the Celluloid Killer, one of the most horrifying murderers the city has ever known.—matt-282 Eric Binford lives for, and if he could have it his way 'in', the movies. He works at a Hollywood 35mm print depot as a delivery boy, but spends all of his free time watching classic films and collecting Hollywood memorabilia. Endlessly tormented by his colleagues, Eric drifts further and further into a dream world wherein he embodies the silver screen characters he so deeply worships. However, when the teasing pushes him too far, he snaps and literally goes into character, donning the outfits of his big screen idols and slowly but surely killing off his tormentors in violent and outrageous recreations of his favorite films. In Los Angeles, Eric Binford is a lonely and outcast cinephile that loves Marilyn Monroe. He is orphan and lives with his crippled Aunt Stella Binford. Eric works in a company of logistics for studios and is bullied by his boss and two co-workers. When he meets Marilyn O'Connor that looks like Marilyn Monroe in a cafeteria, he gives a ride to her and invites Marilyn to go to the movie theater with him. However, she misses the date and a hooker rejects his money to have sex with him and mocks him. When he arrives home, his aunt damages his projector and he pushes her wheelchair down the stairs and assumes the identity of Arthur ""Cody"" Jarrett from ""White Heat"". Then he proceeds his crime spree assuming the identity of villains in movies and killing those who had treated him bad.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Aunt Stella Binford (Eve Brent Ashe) finds her deceased dance partner's son, Eric Binford (Dennis Christopher), asleep in his bedroom while an old movie blares on the small television. As she wakes him, she complains that he wastes his time watching movies all day and night. Stella is full of regrets that Eric's father broke up her dance team, and that her career was cut short by a car accident that left her legs paralyzed when Eric's babysitter called her away from a party to care for the sickly four-year-old. As they eat breakfast, Stella pushes a stack of Eric's VHS movies off the table, and rages that he should fill his mind with knowledge instead of entertainment. Impersonating James Cagney, the cynical Eric informs Stella she talks too much and that someday she is going to eat her words.At Continental Film Services, a movie rental company, Morty Berger (Norman Burton), the hostile and boorish boss, shouts at Eric for being late, and asks him to make a delivery.At a city police station, LAPD Captain M.L. Gallagher (James Luisi) meets with psychiatrist Dr. Jerry Moriarty (Tim Thomerson) to discuss Moriarty's employment at the station. The cynical and racist Gallagher (whom he annoys Moriarty through the movie by referring him as ""Irish"") is openly skeptical that Moriarty's program to rehabilitate juvenile offenders will work, and reminds Moriarity that he has only six months to produce results. Anna Oshenbull (Gwynne Gilford), a more friendly police uniformed officer, shows Moriarty to the basement, where a former drunk tank is his new office.As he leaves to make a delivery, Eric bets his co-workers, Richie (Mickey Rourke) and Bart (Hennen Chambers), $20 each that they cannot figure out Rick's full name in the movie Casablanca (1942). Eric says once he loses the bet, he will pay them $50.After making the film delivery to a local studio, Eric stops at a diner for lunch where he becomes fascinated by an aspiring Australian-accented platinum blonde model named Marilyn O'Connor (Linda Kerridge), sitting in a booth with her friend, Stacy (Marcie Barkin). Eric imagines Marilyn O'Connor made up to look like Marilyn Monroe, singing 'Happy Birthday'. He attempts to impress her with his knowledge of movie trivia, and Marilyn asks him to give her a ride back to work. He leaves her at a skate shop in Venice, California where Marilyn works, and they make plans to see a picture at a Westwood movie theater.Eric arrives home and Stella is impressed when he cleans his room and dresses smartly for his date. Mimicking his best Cary Grant voice, Eric informs Stella his date's name is Marilyn Monroe, and he asks her for some movie money. She agrees in exchange for a back-rub after his return.Eric waits in front of Ship's Diner and then moves on to the theater but Marilyn never shows.At a local restaurant, Marilyn is having dinner with Joey (Peter Horton), a former boyfriend-turned-film producer, who is trying to get her to return to modeling in film, but Marilyn refuses to go along with Joey's so-called ""casting couch"" routine and walks out on him. Just then, she remembers her date with Eric and races off to meet Eric at Ship's Diner.Tired of waiting, Eric returns home, and screens a print of Kiss of Death (1947) in the study. Stella knocks on the door, but he ignores her. However, she then opens the door with her key, and delivers an ultimatum. If he does not find something to do besides wasting his time watching movies, he can find himself another place to live. When he informs her she is missing the best part of the movie, where actor Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo pushes an invalid in a wheelchair down the stairs, she knocks the projector to the floor. Stella then apologizes, but complains that Eric's bedroom is a mess. He replies that she has ruined his movie like she ruins everything, and reenacts the scene from the movie, pushing Stella in her wheelchair down the outdoor staircase, killing her. Afterward, Eric sinks to the bathroom floor, vomiting.A few days later, Eric attends Stella's funeral dressed up as Udo. At home, Eric burns her health food books in the fireplace.The following evening, Eric applies theatrical makeup and dresses as Bela Lugosi in Dracula (1931) and watches a horror film, Night of the Living Dead (1968), at a Midnight matinee. Afterwards, he breaks into Marilyn's house and bursts in on Marilyn in the shower while looking for an autograph in a scene straight out of Psycho (1960). He escapes.Back on the street, Eric sees and chases after a prostitute (the same one who had insulted Eric to his face on the night of what was supposed to be his huge date), who becomes impaled on a fence. Eric proceeds to drink her blood to mimic being a vampire.At work, Eric attempts to collect the money on the Casablanca bet, but Richie reneges and bullies him. Later that evening, dressed as Hopalong Cassidy, Eric confronts Richie at a carnival off the Venice boardwalk, shooting and killing him. At the police station the next day, Eric and Bart leave after their interrogations with the police and Dr. Moriarty. Soon after, the hostile Gallagher orders Moriarty not to interfere with his criminal investigation of the cowboy and Dracula killings.On the street, Eric gets a ride home with an important yet sleazy producer named Gary Bially (Morgan Paull). As they share a marijuana cigarette, Eric pitches a movie idea, and Gary's enthusiasm causes Eric to go home to inform Stella that they will never have to worry about money again as soon as Gary buys his screenplay. He then remembers that Stella is dead. Eric later spends his time buying movie stills, taking photographs at Grauman's Chinese Theater, and watching movies at home. He masturbates to images of Marilyn Monroe and then apologizes to her.Another day or two later, the hostile Morty fires Eric for insubordination and stealing the company scooter without permission. When Eric wants to retrieve his rare movie posters, Morty refuses to allow him into the building. At night, Eric returns dressed as ""The Mummy"", and frightens Morty into having a fatal heart attack.Another day later, while at a local appliance store, Eric sees a television broadcast on one of the many television sets where Gary takes credit for his movie idea during a television interview. When Eric phones Gary to remind him that the idea came from him, Gary denies knowing Eric, and claims not to accept outside material. Eric dresses as James Cagney, playing Cody Jarrett in White Heat (1949), somehow tracks down Gary at a hair salon and sprays him dead with machine gun bullets, in broad daylight. Thus, revealing his identity in the process.Meanwhile, at the Venice boardwalk, Marilyn sees an advertisement posted by a photographer looking for a Marilyn Monroe lookalike, and pursues the job. Police later deem Eric as the prime suspect and search his home, while Gallagher argues with Moriarty that Eric is dangerous. Although Eric has moved out, police confiscate his Polaroid instant snapshots and other items he has left behind.That evening, when Stacy drops Marilyn at the photography studio, Eric is the photographer, dressed as Laurence Olivier from The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Marilyn changes into the showgirl costume, and they drink champagne and dance on an elaborate set. Marilyn says she knows Eric's true identity. Meanwhile, Moriarty and Anna answer a radio call, and discover Eric's photography studio. Along the way, it's revealed by Anna that Stella was actually Eric's mother, not his aunt.At the studio, Eric pulls out a semi-automatic pistol and shoots Moriarty in the leg as he enters the studio, while holding the rookie Anna at bay who hesitates to draw her sidearm. Moriarty attempts reasoning with Eric, who is completely insane and hostile at this point. However, Eric runs away, denying he is Eric.Eric and Marilyn soon head to Hollywood's Chinese Theater. Moriarty follows them inside the theater and urges Eric to release Marilyn, but doing his Cagney impression, Eric refuses to surrender her. While Eric and Marilyn climb to the roof and lock the door behind them, a police SWAT team arrives and surrounds the theater. A marksman ignores Gallagher's orders and shoots Eric in the chest. With a crowd gathering, Gallagher orders Moriarty and Anne removed from the area after they advise him to attempt to talk down Eric from the roof without using lethal force. The angry and now-deranged Gallagher orders his men to shoot-to-kill when they see Eric again.On the roof, Eric pushes Marilyn into the staircase and locks the roof door. He climbs the awning, takes a bow, and taunts the police down on the street to shoot him again.... and the police snipers on the ground respond by shooting him multiple times. With the little strength he has left, Eric climbs back on the ledge and reenacts Cagney dying scene at the end of White Heat (1949). As more shots ring out, Eric plummets to his apparent death on the pavement below."

He is eventually framed for murder and is unsuccessfully executed by many different methods. The policeman Dave Speed is assigned to a mission in an ex-Indian reservation near a military shooting range. Casually, Dave is doing an investigation on the spot. A nuclear missile explodes. The radiation gives him superpowers. Dave is able to move object with the mind force, to discover mysterious crimes and to jump with no problem from a skyscraper. His friends cannot understand those transformations.—Tognacci Sebastiano <seblog@maya.dei.unipd.it> The story starts as a retrospective, as police officer Dave Speed (Terence Hill) faces his fourth execution attempt (this time by the electric chair) for the alleged murder of his superior and friend, Sergeant Willy Dunlop (Ernest Borgnine). While taking his last walk once more, Dave reminisces about how this all got started.Coming fresh from the police academy, Dave is sent to deliver a parking ticket to the member of a tiny Indian village in the Florida Everglades. Unbeknownst to him, the U.S. government and NASA are preparing to conduct a secret radiation experiment in the town by firing a nuclear missile loaded with red plutonium into the village (which had long since been evacuated). Dave, the only person in the village, is hit by the radiation but does not die, and returns to civilization. His tale of having been close to the explosion is marvel led at by most, but dismissed by Dunlop.As time passes, Dave discovers that he has picked up a wide range of superpowers, including super reflexes and speed, endurance, telekinesis, precognition, hypnotism, and the ability to survive a window drop from the 23rd story of a building unscathed. What is more puzzling is that sometimes his powers suddenly fail to work whenever he sees the color red. But his powers, even with their limitation, come as an advantage when counterfeit money is found throughout the city. The masterminds behind this scheme are a local businessman named Torpedo (Marc Lawrence) and his mistress Rosy Labouche (Joanne Dru), a former actress on whom Dunlop has a serious crush. Right now, however, Dave is less a danger to them than an old retired magician named Silvius (Herbie Goldstein), who had inadvertently discovered how Torpedo transports his counterfeit money and now finds himself chased by Torpedo's henchmen. As it turns out, Silvius had also gained superpowers the same way Dave did, and reveals his secret to the young policeman as he flees the city: Whenever he sees the color he saw at the explosion, his power is nullified for as long as he observes it.Dave reveals his secret to Dunlop and Evelyn, who are less than ecstatic about it. While Dunlop points out that Dave's precognitive abilities, which helped uncover Torpedo's scam, is unlikely to be admitted as evidence in court, Evelyn is not overjoyed at having a too-perfect man in the house. One night, Dave and Dunlop proceed to Torpedo's clubhouse, where Dave has Dunlop dance with Rosie (with some hypnotic encouragement) while he poses as a corrupt cop who wants a share of the winnings. By using his hypnotic powers on Torpedo, he gets the gangster to blab out the location of his printing facility: the fishing trawler Barracuda. But in the meantime, Dunlop inadvertently tells Rosie about Dave's powers and weaknesses in order to impress her.Once the information is obtained, Dave and Dunlop proceed out to sea to find the Barracuda. Going aboard alone, Dunlop finds the printing press and the latest stash of money, but is knocked out by Torpedo's men, who lock him into a freezer and then sink the trawler to destroy the evidence. Upon his return to police headquarters, Dave is arrested following a trumped-up accusation by Rosie, who also makes sure that he keeps seeing something red to prevent his escape from prison, though she could not do so during the first three execution attempts.Despite Rosie's last-ditch attempt to ensure Dave's demise by having a bouquet of red roses left in the execution chamber, Dave finally manages to escape prison and jumps into the sea, where he promptly swims to the Barracuda. Once he finds Dunlop aboard, alive but frozen stiff, he uses a borrowed piece of bubblegum to create a balloon, and both men rise out of the ocean and float back to the city. Having heard of Dave's escape, Torpedo and Rosie prepare to flee with Evelyn as their hostage. Dave manages to intercept them by jumping onto their amphibian aircraft and redirecting it to an airfield where the police are waiting. Finally convinced of the validity of Dave's powers, Dunlop over-confidently jumps off the balloon while Dave races to save him with Rosie's red feather boa wrapped around his legs. At the last instant, he manages to catch Dunlop (though in the process they wind up plunging through the earth and straight up to China), and both return safe and sound to prepare for Dave's and Evelyn's wedding. However, Evelyn, still reluctant to have a super-powered husband, has decided to have the last word in the matter by having her hair dyed red."

So two men are sent to Washington to try and stop it.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1982, a shady transaction is occurring between an East German scientist, Dr Krause, and a group of Americans involving a substance known as MM88. MM88 is a deadly virus, created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes, creating a pandemic initially known as the ""Italian Flu"".Within seven months, virtually all of the world's population has died off.

The British nuclear submarine HMS Nereid joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempts to make landfall near Palmer Station.Several years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new home, it is discovered that an earthquake will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States nuclear arsenal.The Soviets have their own version of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station.

""At this point in time, life still matters,"" the captain replies, telling Yoshizumi to stay where he is: He might be safe.Washington is hit by a bomb, and the screen fills with the atomic bomb exploding.

Upon reaching Tierra del Fuego in 1988, he finds survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed vaccine.

Ogami fends off the attack of the first, breaking the samurai's sword and splitting his head. The second attacker jumps over the first, with the first still clasping Ogami's blade. Ogami pulls off a handrail from the cart and a blade comes out, transforming it into a spear. Ogami then uses the spear to impale the second attacker. As the first is dying, he reminds Ogami that he is marked for death.As Ogami and Daigoro sit by a roadside fire and eat their evening meal, Ogami remembers how he offered the infant Daigoro the life-death choice: either Ogami's sword (which would mean that Daigoro would join him on his mission of vengeance against the Shogun) or Daigoro's ball (which would mean that Daigoro would be killed, so that he could be with his mother in heaven). Daigoro chooses the sword. The next day, the Shogun's officials bring Ogami the Shogun's orders: either swear eternal loyalty or commit suicide with Daigoro. Ogami decides to fight his way to freedom with Daigoro, only to have his path blocked by the Shogun and his men. The Shogun challenges Ogami to fight Kurando (the Shogun's son) in a duel; if Ogami wins, he wins his freedom. Ogami accepts, and eventually cuts off Kurando's head.Ogami and Daigoro journey on, never stopping in one place for very long as the Shogun's ninjas are always following them. As they wander, Daigoro recalls how Lord Bizen (Taketoshi Naito) and his men were given orders to kill him. Even though Bizen's men are wearing chain mail beneath their robes, Ogami's skill and blade are too powerful. Ogami lures Lord Bizen into the middle of a stream and uses an underwater sword-slash technique to kill him.

Daigoro goes in search of water for his father, finally bringing it back in his mouth, then takes some food offerings from a roadside shrine, leaving his jacket in honorable exchange.The Supreme Ninja meets with Lord Kurogawa to report her failure but Lord Kurogawa has another plan: to strike at Ogami through Daigoro.Later that night, Daigoro is lured outside the hut by the sound of a woman singing. Waking up to find Daigoro gone, Ogami searches for his son. He finds Daigoro is a prisoner of Lord Kurogawa and the Supreme Ninja. Daigoro is tied up and suspended over a deep well. Kurogawa demands that Ogami surrender or he will drop Daigoro down the well. Ogami refuses, so Kurogawa and his men attack. Kurogawa lets go of the rope suspending Daigoro over the well, but Ogami manages to stamp his foot down on the rope and kill Kurogawa (and his two ninjas) at the same time. Ignoring the Supreme Ninja, who has not moved throughout the fight, Ogami carefully pulls Daigoro up to safety. Instead of killing the Supreme Ninja, Ogami walks away with Daigoro.Ogami and Daigoro board a ship which is carrying the 'Masters of Death' to their rendezvous with Lord Kiru. Also on board is the Supreme Ninja. During the night, the remaining rebels start a fire on board the ship. In the ensuing inferno, the 'Masters of Death' tell Ogami that they recognize him, but that they will not attack him as long as he makes no move against them. Ogami agrees to their terms and they leave him. The companionway is blocked by flames, so he cuts through the deck planking. Ogami then puts Daigoro in his cart and throws them both overboard to safety. The Supreme Ninja attacks Ogami from underwater but he overpowers her. Getting Daigoro, himself and the Supreme Ninja to shore and to the shelter of a fisherman's hut, he strips all three of them naked and gathers them close together, telling the Supreme Ninja that they must share their body heat or die. The Supreme Ninja doesn't understand why he would save her and realizes she cannot kill Ogami or his son. The next day, Ogami and Daigoro leave her there, knowing that she will have to return to the Shogun, report her failure and commit suicide.The 'Masters of Death' escort Lord Kiru and his entourage through a desert area, where they are attacked by a rebel force concealed under the sand. The 'Masters of Death' then fight off and kill all of the rebels. Lord Kiru is taken to safety. However, they haven't gone far before they see Daigoro standing in their way. He points to Ogami, who is waiting. The 'Masters of Death' finally face off against Ogami, but one by one they are cut down and killed. Ogami then chases after Lord Kiru's procession, driving off the guards. Lord Kiru protests that he is the Shogun's brother, but Ogami tells Kiru that the ""Shogun means nothing"" to him. Ogami then kills Lord Kiru with his sword.As he and his father walk away from the carnage, Daigoro looks back one last time and says via voice-over, ""I guess I wish it was different ... but a wish is only a wish""."

Meanwhile, BIM's marketing employee introduces a holographic triangular BIM sticker for people wear on their bodies.
The next day, Alphie and Bibi go to BIM's office, because Boogalow wants to be their agent. Bibi is excited, but Alfie doesn't trust Boogalow, and doesn't want to sign a contract unless they have a lawyer look at it. While they wait, another client's singers and dancers stage a production number (""Showbiznes""). Boogalow and his lawyers, James Clark and Clark James (Michael Logan and Clem Davies) offer the pair separate contracts. Alphie hallucinates a musical number (""The Apple"") where Boogaloo is Satan (which he actually is) and Dandi seduces Bibi into biting an apple. Alphie fails to stop Bibi signing her contract, but he refuses to sign his. Boogalow immediately changes Bibi's look and plans a concert tour for her (""How to Be a Master""). She moves into the residence, has an affair with Dandi, and becomes a star (""Speed""). In the outside world, it is now mandatory that everyone wear a visible BIM sticker, and stop for an hour a day to exercise to the BIM song, with the police enforcing the laws being BIM employees (""BIM"" reprise).
Alphie keeps trying to reach Bibi. He's broke, but hopes to sell his new song, ""Where Has Love Gone?"", until a producer tells him it's out of style. Alphie's landlady (Miriam Margolyes) encourages him to go after Bibi. BIM's enforcers beat him up, and the landlady nurses him with chicken soup. Meanwhile, Bibi feels trapped in her new life and wishes she could leave BIM (""Cry for Me""). Alphie goes back to Boogalow's home, where the ongoing party is in full swing. Pandi drugs and seduces him (""Coming""), but early the next morning he runs away. An old hippie (Joss Ackland) finds Alphie and gives him shelter in a cave with a large group of other hippies.
Pandi regrets her involvement with BIM, and helps Bibi escape and go back to Alphie (""I Found Me""). They marry, have a baby, and live with the hippies (""Child of Love""). After a year, Boogalow and the BIM police find them, tell Bibi she owes $10 million for violating her contract, and try to arrest everyone. Alphie says ""Mr. Topps"" will save them, then a glowing Cadillac appears in the sky and God, aka Mr. Topps (also Joss Ackland), comes down to stop Boogalow. Alphie, Bibi and child, joined by Pandi and the hippies, walk into the sky, and Topps tells Boogalow that he will take the hippies to a new planet (""Love: The Universal Melody"" reprise)."

""Shakespeare revised and corrected by Castellano & Pipolo is like the Bible read and commented on by Pannella: a contradiction. The film barely holds up in the first part, then it loses the pieces along the way. In any case, sensational collections at the cinema.""
""Out of modesty it is good to omit the name of Shakespeare from this modern version of 'The Taming of the Shrew' bent to the needs of the character that Celentano animates with some gimmicks. But the film is shot with the left hand.""
This is the first movie with collaboration of Adriano Celentano and Ornella Muti."

Sister Virginia de Leyva becomes the new Mother Superior at the convent of Monza. Said convent turns out to be a veritable hotbed of sinful carnality and depravity. Debauched priest Don Arrigone and lecherous womanizer Giampaolo Osio plot to seduce sister Virginia. But will their wicked and lustful actions continue to go unnoticed?—Woodyanders Much to the disappointment of the holy sisterhood, young, pious Sister Virginia de Leyva lands the position of Mother Superior at the Santa Margherita convent in Monza, northern Italy. As the beautiful servant of God incites envy, a lascivious maniac and a depraved priest set their sights on breaking the abbess' will by humiliation and sexual abuse. And, little by little, Sister Virginia starts having impure thoughts and lustful visions. Is Sister Virginia's faith compromised? Can the nun of Monza fend off the unholy invitations of the flesh?—Nick Riganas The 'Nun of Monza' is the notorious story of Sister Virginia Maria de Leyva, first told in 'I Promessi Sposi' or 'The Betrothed' by Alessandro Manzoni in 1840. It is based in part on actual events that occurred in the 1630s in Spanish-occupied Italy, in which the Sister bore Gianpaolo Osio two children, and he committed several murders in a vain attempt to hide the truth. In this Bruno Mattei retelling of the story, Sister Virginia Maria (Zora Kerova) is sent to the convent of Monza, where she quickly becomes the target of the lecherous fugitive, Gianpaolo Osio, with the aid of his compatriot, the corrupt priest, Don Paolo Arrigone.
But the pious Sister Virginia is also the Lady of Monza, mistress of the de Leyva estates upon the death of her father. Consequently, the Sisters elect her to be their Mother Superior when old Sister Imbersaga dies, and she selects the devious lesbian, Sister Benedetta (Paola Montenero), as her assistant.
To protect his affair with Sister Candida, Father Arrigone blackmails Sister Benedetta into arranging a liaison between Virginia and Osio. The two are conveniently 'discovered' by Arrigone and Candida, and they allow Osio to rape Virginia as Benedetta watches and masturbates.
Osio continues to press his desire for the now-compromised Sister Virginia, deluding her into thinking he truly cares for her, and that theirs is a spiritual union. Eventually Virginia turns up pregnant, while Osio is imprisoned for murdering a maid. The baby, however, is born dead, and an ambitious novitiate, Margherita and Osio (who is somehow no longer in prison) toss the body into the river, after which they make love.
Sister Virginia repents of her sin, and commits Margherita to a penitence cell after she threatens the Mother Superior with exposure, supposedly to prepare herself for her vows of sisterhood. But Margherita doesnt relent in her threats against the convent, so the ruthless Osio is brought in to murder her.
But its too late - the older nuns have called an inquisitor to the convent to purge it of the heretics. Osio escapes, but the three nuns, Virginia, Benedetta and Candida are imprisoned for life."

At home, he has taken it upon himself to become the next true Santa; he sleeps in a Santa costume, and his apartment is resplendent all year round with Christmas toys and décor. From the roof of his building, he uses binoculars to spy on neighborhood children to see if they have been 'bad or good' (two children are doing household chores and playing with their doll, the third child, Moss Garcia, is shown rifling through a Penthouse magazine and cutting out a nude photograph). Harry runs back home and writes Moss' name in his ""Bad Boys & Girls"" book.On his way home from work, Harry peeps into the window of a local bar and sees co-worker Frank Stoller, whom earlier that day had phoned-in sick and Harry had relieved on the assembly line. Harry becomes angry that Frank lied to him about being sick just to avoid not going to work. Harry rushes home, hums a Christmas tune, and breaks one of his male dollhouse figures.The following morning Harry phones his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and cancels his plans to come over for Thanksgiving dinner with Phil and his family.One month later on Christmas Eve, the Company Christmas party for Jolly Dreams is in full swing. Harry watches the owner of Jolly Dreams making a televised announcement that, if production increases sufficiently, the company will be able to donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital. Just then, Harry is greeted by one of his co-workers, named Ben, who thanks him for taking Frank's place at the warehouse on the assembly line. Frank then introduces Harry to newcomer employee George.At home, Harry realizes that people generally consider him a ""schmuck"" and is constantly exploited by others. He then has a nervous breakdown, and he is now convinced that he truly is Santa Claus. Down in his basement workshop, he begins smelting toy soldiers (with swords at attention) and small axes.Alone after-hours, Harry gets a brilliant idea. He steals company toys, wraps them, loads them into his van, and later drops them off at the hospital. He then leaves a bagful of dirt at bad-boy Moss Garcia's doorstep. Sometime later, Harry passes by a local community center where a party is being held. Two men outside see Harry in his Santa costume and mistake him for the Santa that was supposed to show up for the children. They pull him inside where Harry has fun mingling with the other attendees and giving toy soldiers to the children also there. He soon leaves, but announces to the children to be good or they will not get any presents for next year.At around midnight, Harry passes by a local church where he murders three teenage parishioners who happen to taunt him at the bottom steps of the church.

Several street-corner Santas are brought in for questioning as well as police line-up for the witnesses to the three murders outside the church.On Christmas morning, Phil begins to suspect something is seriously wrong with his brother and argues with his wife Jackie. Their children are preoccupied with watching the Laurel and Hardy version of Babes in Toyland on TV, and do not seem to mind playing with their damaged and sub-par toys.At the closed warehouse, Harry gains entrance and activates the assembly lines, breaking even-more toys in the process.That night he drives off, and his van becomes stuck in the snow on a beautifully decorated street with plenty of lights, sending him further into a delusional state. By now his costume is dirty and disheveled. He eventually finds himself on the wrong side of his brother's neighborhood. When he offers to give a toy soldier to a group of needy children, the children's parents happen by and threaten Harry. One father attacks him with a switchblade knife, before the children come to Harry's defense and allow him to get away. This does not stop a large torch-bearing mob from chasing him. Nevertheless, he manages to drive his van out of the sludge and arrives at his brother's house.Phil quickly realizes that his brother is the homicidal Santa he has heard announced on the news. Harry tries to justify his actions to his brother, but Phil proceeds to choke him unconscious. Phil loads Harry into the front seat of the van, whereupon Harry comes-to, cold-cocks him, and again drives off.

Paul Godard (Jacques Dutronc) is shaving while a woman sings opera next door. A chambermaid collects a tray. Godard makes a phone call.He asks for Denise Rimbaud. She is not there and there is no message. He asks to be put through to a video studio while telling the opera woman to shut up, which she does for all of 20 seconds. He tells the video studio he'll be there in an hour, and leaves the hotel room to a corridor, where a bell boy, carrying another guest's luggage is apparently star-struck and tries to commandeer an irritated M. Godard, who, brushing him off goes out in the lobby and down the main escalator with the opera singer still audible in full voice. The bell boy rushes ahead.Out to the car park, the bell boy gives his leaving guests their suitcases and rushes after Godard as he gets in his car. He tells Godard he is wonderful and apologises for the ""other night"" (saying he was drunk). He then announces he loves him and wants to be buggered by him and tries to kiss him as he pulls off. Now the bell-boy is angry in an obsessed sad-fan kind of way and denounces this as ""The Devils City"" as we cut to a scene of a young-ish lady riding a bike through a countryside B-road. This is Denise.We hear bells (cattle type) as we watch the woman cycle in varying speeds and durations of freeze-frame and video slow motion and we get the caption:-1 (i.e. minus one) : SAUVE QUI PEUT [slow motion] as translated by the subtitle.[But a point worth noting, that Sauve qui peut actually means every man for himself or literally save himself who can so I have no idea why this has been translated it seems as slow motion. and is also the UK title of the film, where in every other language it is translated more directly.]
And so we continue with the cyclist. And piano music, which is used repeatedly throughout the film and often stops abruptly.A new caption:0: LA VIE. The subtitle says RUN FOR YOUR LIFE but as we know, la vie means the life.A tracking right shot with piano & synth music. Green fields, a river, it is kind of a POV of the cycling woman looking left. We cut to a shot from behind her, still cycling, uphill, and the music abruptly stops to allow the sound of 4 cyclists overtaking her, the music resumes while a 5th, trailing cyclist passes. Back to the previous tracking shot.Next Denise is in a café writing some notes and the music once again stops abruptly. She has a think and her coffee arrives.All we hear is chatter, but she asks the waitress what is the music she can hear. This is an important point, and is repeated several times throughout the film by several different characters, asking where the music is coming from when there is none (certainly we as an audience cannot hear any, but this also seems to be backed up by the reaction of characters too.) The waitress has no idea what she's on about and cannot hear any music, and calls for her colleague Frederique (although he never comes and this mini plot strand is never concluded).Meanwhile, we cut to two women also in the café, who are sitting with an unrelated single smoking man on the same table, and we are (presumably along with Denise) overhearing their conversation: ""They had a daughter who married a schoolteacher And their 3rd son, who was called Andre, was a bit simple. Yes I remember, Then he had a car crash when he was with Taugus wife that was quite a scandal Yes, he married one of the Bioux cousins An odd girl.""As we cut back to Denise we overhear more: His parents were against it Then he left. Do you know whats become of him? No, I heard nothing more. I wonder whats become of him Didnt he go off to Risoux? As far as I know, hes still in France He is.Its hard to tell whether Denise here is passive, or is actually listening in as we are.She thanks the waitress, and asks after a M. Piaget, as she was meant to meet him there. The waitress says he has been by, but went to take photos of the football match, which isnt far. So we cut to a very short journey with a short snippet of music of her cycling presumably to the match (although the journey seems to bear no resemblance to as described by the waitress).Cut to the match and music abruptly stops. Its not a football match it seems, more a collection of disparate people, adults and kids, doing disparate odd things. There is indeed a guy taking photos though. He comes over when our cyclist arrives.Fancy meeting you here he says, so she obviously was not meant to meet him in the café.A new caption1: LIMAGINAIRE (The Imaginary)
(it actually is literally translated as the imagination I think)Piaget asks her if shes working on a novel, that in her letter she had said she was working on writing about how things really are.She says You mock the heritage system, yet now you act just like your father. He has taken over his business. He says It was awful. Thats what the revolution is all about. Its alright now. At least I have the countryside so the countryside represents freedom, liberty.Cut to the odd game, with some more freeze-frame shit going on. Its a very odd game where they seem to be trying to catch a ball with wooden sheets on planks.As she leaves, he tells her to call at the shop later, when hes spoken to Madeleine. Freeze-framing stops. Another shot of cycling down a road, again with the cowbell sound.Next we are at a farm, a woman is explaining to Denise how the silo of grain for the cattle works.She asks if she can make a phone call from here, and the new woman says yes. Then she shows her how she can get a good licking from a cow, straight out of the blue! Our woman has no real expression on her reaction, she just looks down with her eyes, but doesnt seem particularly embarrassed.Next the phone call Denise is whispering Youll have to get Duras for me. She is on the phone to Paul.During the conversation, we cut to a scene with Paul in it, in the TV video studio (editing suite), but keep the same audio (which now has the piano track too), in editing grammar this normally means simultaneous action, but as she is speaking to Paul on the phone then obviously not. She continues and says she took back her key because she is finished / starting anew, and she is selling her flat.Someone in the room asks her name, and tells her shes put her case in her room, and tells her where it is.Continuing to explain things to Paul (quite calmly and amicably) Ive dragged it out for two years. You should congratulate me. People say they want someone to lean on, I wanted someone to lean with. Weve never been together, never leaned on each other, never leaned together, something seemed to stop us. Its not a tragedy.Cut to Paul in the video studio, now he is on the phone! He asks the address and takes it down and says this doesnt mean we should stop. Not knowing someone makes it more interesting, even passionate. And he promises hell do something with the flat, but not now because of his daughter Cecile and his ex-wife. When she doesnt seem pleased, he suggests she talks it over with Yvette, and hands the phone to someone called Yvette in the editing suite. Yvette talks briefly its always the last time until the next and bids her farewell.Cut to horses grazing. Cowbells in the distance. Denise getting dressed in her new room. Its morning. Lights a fag. Starts making notes and reads back out loud what she has written Something in the body and in the mind arches its back against routine and void..La vie. A quicker gesture. An arm. An arm moving up and down off beat. A slower step forward.We cut to cycling shot, I think the same as the last one, on a bend in the road.A gust of air. A startled gasp. A wrong move.Cut to a type-setter setting type. This is Piagets shop a publication of some sort or a printing house. Madeleine is there. Denise is there. She talks briefly with Piaget about a job there.As she cycles off there is a woman with fur, smartly dressed city type, walking down the rural road.Cycling through a forest she passes as accordion player, a plough and arrives in a centre. A man is bullying Giorgiana, telling her to choose. A man pulls up in an F1 car. Giorgiana gets hit and still wont choose. A man in an orange suit walks along. A train goes past. The F1 man leaves. The bullying man leaves on his motorbike. Another train goes past as we cut to:Football training. Paul is there to pick up his daughter Cecile. A new caption:2. FEARPaul talks to the football coach about his daughter in a paedo way.He picks up Cecile.MAUGARITE DURAS is playing on the stereo. I think, or it might just be VO.A scene where he is picking something up in a school from a teacher. Ridiculous but where he says he is to pick up Duras, and calls out her name.He is asked to say a few words to the class. Among the things he says is I make films to keep myself busy.He is driving again with Cecile in the back and (presumably) Duras narrating..Edit suite. Denise answers the phone and switches off the suite and leaves the building, where she (in video slo-mo) embraces Paul with romantic music. Then a heated argument about Duras.A café. Ceciles birthday. Cecile is talking about the history of blackbirds. Paul takes over. It is from a Kundera book. Humans can do what they want and the earth doesnt give a shit, but when blackbirds start following humans into cities thats when the world order changes. He is with his ex-wife. They do not get on, and she just wants her cheque.
Paul says he thinks Denise wants him to keep the flat in case she comes back.A scene of cars.Paul meets Denise at a bar. love couldnt survive without bits of work.Cut to the woman with furs, at the same bar. She is listening to a bloke tell her a joke (we dont cut back to him). At the end, she asks, what is that music?Paul tries to go with Denise, they have a little scuffle as he tries to stop her going.A queue outside a cinema an angry cinema-goer is shouting that there is no sound!The camera lands on a couple, a blonde woman asking a bloke if he wants to go to the cinema. She took her pants off for him to touch her. Hes not interested. Im trying to create a meaningful relationship between us, dont you see? as if this woman is foregrounding/verbalising the cinematic/narrative devices usually hidden in the subtext of a film.Freeze frame of traffic.Cut to close up of blonde making sex noises. This is Isabelle. VO is possibly more Duras?3. LE COMMERCE (The Business)Paul arrives by Isabelles bedside. Gives her some money, kisses her and leaves. She smokes a fag. Next she is in a supermarket, then carpark. In her car she is chased down by two guys and with freeze-frame action they hold her in a car and make her repeat that no-one is independent.Only the banks are independentThey smack her bottom.Were not killers. We dont want all your money only halfA flat. Two women. One shouts out of a window. She asks the other one what she does for a living. She says she is an illustrator.In the same flat, Isabelle is telling Helene its not her turn to wash up. Helene arrives, saying shes such a pain your sister.Isabelle makes a call about the ad for the flat. Her flatmate asks whats that music? There is no music.Isabelles sister needs money. 20-30K. To go sailing. Did a failed robbery/ Her friends are in jail.
Isabelle hasnt got it and shes leaving anyway. Sister says shes not asking about it, she wanted to ask about being a prossie. Isabelle gives her the low-down. She says she wants half the money and its a deal.A man with glasses in a bed with an orange headboard. He is on the phone. Reads paper and a knock at the door. Claudia sent me is the voice as we see a shot of shoppers down below.He is on another phone call, a business call, and Isabelle strips. Meanwhile a voice-over.
Asleep in their rags... On the grass. By the beach. Others were sitting on the stone benches. Sharing a pathetic bottle. The gulls wheeled madly above. Mindlessly. Old ladies of seventy or more sat on the benches......and spoke of selling the inheritance left ages ago by their husbands...And stupidly managed, believe meIn short. There was peace in the airAnd we walked a bit. Then lay on the grass in silence. It simply felt good. Being together. I bought sandwiches. Crisps and some beer. And we ate on the sand. Then I held Cass and we slept for an hour or so. It was even better than making love. Floating in sleep without the tension of desire. We drove back and I cooked dinner. Then I asked Cass if she'd like to live with me. She paused. Then looked at me and said no.A hundred
That's how it goes
Well, think it over
Yes, ask for M. Person
20-15-51, room 510Ye gods, she's showing her arse to the whole town
Isabelle asks Enjoying the view? but is kurtly told to shut up, and That'll do, you can get dressed.She asks if his name is really M. Person, and he says it is. When she remarks that it is unusal, he replies Isn't it normal for a person to be called Person?
Look, I burned myselfP as in Person

You'll really do anything?Yes, as long as it doesn't hurtI'd never do thatWhat's your name?IsabelleIsabelle, go out into the corridor. Then come back in thirty seconds, all right? You're our daughter. You're back from England. We're in town. You come and see us at the hotel. Then you say: ''Hello, Daddy''. Then kiss your Mummy.She goes out to the corridor, where she is recognized immediately by a passing woman, by Marie-Luce who she was at school with. Although this is a huge coincidence, neither party seem to make much of it. They have a brief and bizarre exchange, lasting probably exactly 30 seconds, in which Marie-Luce offers Isabelle a job.I might have something. I deal with people who are looking for people
Isabelle is interested, and she gives her an address to meet at in one hour. She then knocks on the hotel room door to begin the charade.
Oh look! It's Isabelle! What a surprise! Hasn't she grown? Look, she's got tits now. Show Mummy your tits.
Shot of the back of a lorry with breeze-blocks on.
And what an arse she's got. Show that too. Now you show your arse to your daughter. It's bigger than yours. Now, Mummy, show your bush to your daughter. There! Look at our daughter's lovely bush. A pretty little red bush... Like the colour of autumn

You always mess things upYou're patheticThat's not trueRed car arrives in carpark. Its Isabelle arriving at her new job interview. Cut to man working on a stienbeck. Isabelle is shown in.She is told by the man she will have to travel. Once a month she will get a ticket by post, she goes and comes back. When she asks where she will go; It depends. Caracas, Beirut, New York, Paris even. When she asks what she will do; Nothing. Just travel. Go to a hotel, stay a couple of days and come back. Marie Luce adds And you'll get 5,000 dollars when you leave and 5,000 dollars when you get back
And she will start on the 10th or 15th.Cut to Isabelle in a shopping place. She enters a flat and announces that Claudia sent her, and a bloke sternly and disinterestedly says only Put your coat there. Sit down. Jerk me a little.
A voice from another room shouts through, asking what she is like. She is told to continue undressing as she points out that she has to use the phone first.
Cut to an office, a businessman is at his desk on the phone making a business call. There is a second woman standing naked in this room.Till tomorrowSo what's her arse like?Nothing specialHe tells his inferior to take his trousers off, too
He makes another business call. Hello, I'd like to call Montreal, Canada, please

Borderline,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080465/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On the U.S.-Mexican border, border cop Jeb Maynard is hunting for a human smuggler responsible for Jeb's partner's murder. Jeb Maynard is a patrolman guarding the U.S.-Mexican border, whose partner and buddy Scooter has just been murdered. Maynard knows that a smuggler of illegal aliens is responsible for Scooter's death, but the feds insist that drug dealers committed the crime. If this villainous smuggler is going to be caught, Maynard is going to have to do the dirty work himself.—alfiehitchie The film follows a United States Border Patrol Agent in Charge, Jeb Maynard (Bronson), who is forced to track down the killers of a young Mexican boy and his colleague and friend, a veteran Senior Patrol Agent, ""Scooter"" Jackson, portrayed by (Wilford Brimley). Jeb Maynard is the Patrol Agent in Charge of the ""fictional"" Otay Border Patrol Station, located in the hills east of San Diego, CA. Otay Station is a composite of the actual El Cajon, CA and Brown Field, CA Border Patrol Stations. He is helped by the young boy's mother, Elena Morales, (Karmin Murcelo) and a rookie Border Patrol Agent, Jimmy Fantes, (Kirby).Senior Patrol Agent Jackson and the young boy are murdered by Hotchkiss, a ruthless alien smuggler, also called ""the Marine"" by the aliens, portrayed by (Ed Harris). The murders take place when a truckload of illegal aliens being smuggled by Hotchkiss is stopped by Senior Patrol Agent Jackson while on routine road patrol. The truck has boxes of tomatoes on top of a hidden roof on the back of the truck. Under the roof is a hidden compartment containing the load of illegal aliens. Hotchkiss shoots ""Scooter"" from a concealed position in the back of the truck with a sawed-off shotgun at close range. The Mexican boy is badly wounded by stray buck shot so Hotchkiss finishes him off with another blast from his shotgun. Hotchkiss drags the bodies into the bushes along the side of the road and conceals the Border Patrol sedan in the same bushes. The other alien smuggler driving the truck with Hotchkiss becomes very nervous about the murders so Hotchkiss later kills him to keep him silent after they drop off the load of illegal aliens at a local fruit ranch, owned by well to do fruit farmer Carl Richards, and used as a front to smuggle aliens. Hotchkiss later abandons the truck used to smuggle the aliens along a rural road. Hotchkiss leaves the body of the other alien smuggler who was driving the truck the night of the murders, along with the truck, and conceals some small bags of marijuana in the truck to make it appear to be a drug smuggler's vehicle. Other Border Patrol Agents find the bodies of Agent ""Scooter"" Jackson and the boy, and the Border Patrol car later in the morning. Agent Fantes finds some fresh tomatoes near the bodies. Agent Maynard notices some boot prints in the dirt among all the other foot prints at the crime scene. These particular prints were made by a pair of military style boots with some odd markings in the soles. One of a veteran Border Patrol Agent's professional skills is ""sign-cutting."" ""Sign-cutting"" is the skill to examine, analyze, and interpret tracks and marks made in the ground. Patrol Agents use this skill to track groups of illegal aliens crossing the border. Maynard has Fantes take the tomatoes to the Agriculture department of a nearby university for analysis. The F.B.I. is called to investigate. The F.B.I. has primary juridiction investigating the murder of any federal agents. A couple of days later the abandoned truck is found with the drugs. The F.B.I. agents investigating the murders wrongly conclude that Agent ""Scooter"" Jackson stopped some drug smugglers that night and was shot because of it. Hotchkiss is running a sophisticated and highly profitable alien smuggling operation between Mexico and the United States. Maynard and Fantes start checking the trails in the hills that the smugglers use to bring in illegal aliens and drugs. They find the same military boot prints along a trail where a Border Patrol electronic ground sensor has been dug up and disabled. Hotchkiss is a former U.S. Marine who had been trained on such equipment while in the Marine Corps. He discovered the sensor and disabled it on a prior smuggling run.Jeb Maynard thinks that ""Scooter"" Jackson was murdered by alien smugglers and tries to convince the F.B.I. that the marijuana in the truck was merely a ruse. The F.B.I. does not believe him. After ""Scooter"" Jackson's funeral with full honors, Jeb tells his boss, I&NS Commissioner Malcolm Wallace, about his suspicions. Commissioner Wallace cautions Jeb to proceed carefully in the matter. So Jeb begins his own investigation of the murders with the assistance of Patrol Agent Jimmy Fantes. Maynard had found a piece of paper with a San Diego address on it in the murdered Mexican boy's clothes. Maynard goes to the address and finds the boy's mother, Elena Morales, working at a well to do family's home as their nanny. Maynard takes Elena to the morgue so she can identify her son's remains. Maynard then asks for her help in finding her son's killers. Elena is brave and she agrees. Maynard goes undercover posing as the woman's cousin. They cross into Mexico and she introduces him to an alien smuggler in Tijuana, Mexico who brought her over the border when she last crossed. This smuggler is Hotchkiss's partner in Mexico. Maynard's physical features are such that he can pass for Mexican. Elena tells the smuggler that her cousin is simple minded and doesn't talk much. Jeb Maynard cannot speak Spanish well enough to pass as a native Mexican. Elena pays the smuggler with money Jeb gave her.They are smuggled across the U.S.-Mexican border and through the hills east of San Diego into the United States along with a group of thirty illegal aliens. Maynard hears the smuggler guiding the group talking about ""the Marine"" who runs things"" to Elena. But then the group is ambushed by bandits who want to rob the group. Jeb and Elena escape unharmed. Jeb and Elena walk back towards the suburbs of San Diego. Jeb gets Elena home and thanks her for her help. He tell Elena that she should stop by his office the following week and he will try to help her straighten out her immigration status in the United States.Maynard gets home, cleans up, and tries to get some sleep. Jimmy Fantes stops by Maynard's home to report to him that the agriculture report came back on the tomatoes found at the crime scene. These particular tomatoes were treated with a particular new brand of pesticide. Fantes checked with the local office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and only a few large farms in the local area use that brand of pesticide. Maynard and Fantes meet later at the Border Patrol station to plan their next move. They put on their Border Patrol uniforms and drive in Jeb's Border Patrol S.U.V. to check the local fruit farms that use that pesticide. They finally end up at Carl Richards's large fruit ranch. Jeb knows of Richards's reputation for hiring illegal aliens for poor wages to harvest his fruit. Hotchkiss is in the main ranch house when Maynard and Fantes arrive. Hotchkiss stays inside the house and Richards goes outside to speak to the Border Patrol Agents. While talking to Richards, Jeb Maynard notices the same style military boot prints in the dirt near the main house that he detected at the crime scene.Jeb Maynard and Jim Fantes set up a surveillance of the Richards Ranch with the assistance of Border Patrol Agents Lambert and Monroe. While using binoculars they see Hotchkiss wearing his combat boots and camouflage marine field jacket departing the house with other smugglers, including the Mexican smuggler who was guiding the group that Jeb and Elena had infiltrated. Maynard has found ""the Marine"". Hotchkiss is planning a large alien smuggling run soon that will bring hundreds of illegal aliens into the U.S. in one evening. Then he plans on shutting down operations for a while until things cool off.From what he witnesses on the surveillance of the ranch over the following days Jeb Maynard deduces Hotchkiss's plans. Maynard get all his agents together at the station and plans an operation for the following evening. The Border Patrol is going to raid the Richards Ranch. Jeb Maynard and his Border Patrol Agents raid the ranch in the late evening/early morning capturing all the illegal aliens and the smugglers bringing them into the ranch's main barn. At dawn Hotchkiss arrives at the ranch with the last load of illegal aliens. As the Patrol Agents attempt to arrest him Hotchkiss pulls out a model MAC-10 nine millimeter machine pistol and fires a burst at the agents. The agents take cover and Hotchkiss jumps in a car and speeds away. Jeb Maynard pursues him in a Border Patrol four wheel drive truck. Hotchkiss attempts to lose Maynard on an old dirt road. The road dead ends and Hotchkiss runs on foot into the surrounding trees and bushes. Maynard draws his Smith and Wesson Model 28 .357 Magnum revolver from its holster and starts tracking Hotchkiss through the forest. Hotchkiss cirlces around back to the vehicles thinking he has given Maynard the slip. Just as Hotchkiss is about to get back in his car Maynard emerges from the treeline with his revolver pointed at Hotchkiss and says, ""the end of the road."" Hotchkiss wheels about and starts firing his MAC-10 machine pistol at Maynard. Maynard is a better shot and kills Hotchkiss with a single shot from his .357 Magnum.The film ends with Maynard and Fantes watching Richards leaving the United States Court House in San Diego, CA after he has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for alien smuggling. Fantes laments that Richards will probably go right back to smuggling aliens within a month of his release from prison. Jeb Maynard responds by saying, It's okay kid, we'll be there waiting for him."

Thus, instead of doctors creating a monster, the monsters are already there as the species of the future - but one of them is suspected by the doctors of being a human being. That is Golem in reverse.—Polish Cinema Database <http://info.fuw.edu.pl/Filmy/> Set in a dystopian, post apocalyptic future, the movie opens with shots of a mass of white rats interspersed with masked doctors hovering over their new creation, a man. Next we see two men, identical in appearance, under interrogation in a police station. Both claim to know nothing about the death of a neighbour. One man, remembering nothing of himself except for his work as an engraver, is released while the other is carried away, dead. On release the protagonist picks up his coat, but complains as it does not fit so cannot be his original coat. The protagonist leaves the building and looks up at the windows, as the panes open and close in unison. On his return to his apartment he encounters a crazy young man and on the stairs of his apartment watches as a prostitute accepts a blind man and his brother as clients. At the top of the stairs a figure in the darkness offers him a handful of grain.Two doctors are admonished by an official for letting the copy of the original, now dead, man leave. His name is/was Pernat. The living Pernat now sits in his dank room engraving an image of the hanged man from the tarot. The grain is on the desk and some of the seeds are sprouting. Pernat leaves the building and meets the prostitute on the stairs, she is the sister of the crazy young man. She mentions that there is something different about him and that he is missing his glasses. In a basement store he asks for potatoes from the shop assistant, she is mending plastic dolls with straw. Her father enters and insists on being given money to retrieve a book from the pawn brokers. She has no money but Pernat takes a few bills of his own and stuffs them into the head of a doll, for the father to find. Pernat accompanies the father onto the street and is dragged into a nearby cinema/church by the father, who insists he must confess his clay dreams. A short instructional film, tells the audience that happiness is their obligation and that the medical profession can help achieve this. We see layers of a plastic substance being pealed away to reveal the head of a man. At this Pernat runs to the toilet and in a cubicle peals away a thin layers of skin from his own face. Outside he meets a man, the superintendent, and Pernat helps him carry a stove. The crazy young man, the superintendent's son, appears, yelling, and his sister is called upon to calm him down. His sister is the prostitute. The superintendent asks Pernat to fix his watch as its hands are moving backwards.The doctors return to the screen to tell us that their aim is to create a better human species and Pernat is their experiment. They agree to let him remain in the community.While working in his blackened room Pernat is joined, at the window, by a worker come to check his stove. There is no large stove in his attic room but the smoke must be coming from somewhere? On the stairs again and Pernat meets the superintendent and his daughter to be told that there are now two Pernats registered at this address. Pernat goes back to the store to ask the shop assistant to take a walk with him. She won't go as she needs to earn money so her father can retrieve his book. Pernat lends her the money and when the father finds out,he is surprised that Pernat would simply lend money, he assumed his daughter had prostituted herself. He sees that Pernat is kind-hearted and says his book would be of help to him. They go together to retrieve it.The doctors decide to put Pernat through a series of tests. At the dentist, Pernat has a checkup where his eyes are diagnosed with cataracts. He is knocked out and wakes up in the dark being fed by another. Later, Pernat sits at his desk and the superintendent is bothering him. The grain has now all sprouted but the superintendent opens a packet of pigeon poison and drops it on the sprouts. The superintendent takes his arm and chest measurements then asks to see his ID card. Pernat has lost his card and returns to the police station to find it. Pernat does not appear to know his own name. The policeman tells him that although they talked for several hours previously his name is not on the register and that he should leave. On his return home Pernat encounters the young man, railing crazy thoughts. He gives Pernat a vial of blood to give to his father, the superintendent.
The shop assistant's father comes to Pernats apartment with his book. It seems the engraving that Pernat has been working on fits as a cover for the book. The book holds the answer as to why man was created, but for Pernat only, and he offers the book to Pernat but when he declares Pernat a fool he takes it away again.The doctors discuss how individuality threatens society and that an increase in Pernat's consciousness will make him rebel. The prostitute, Rozyna, throws herself at Pernat and he offers to take her to the cinema. They travel up a long metro escalator to find a number of television sets with a rock band playing on the screen. They continue up the escalators and Pernat finds himself watching the lead guitarist, alone on a small stage, being filmed for TV. Rozyna has gone and the people around havent seen her and are not interested. Pernat returns down the escalators to look for Rozyna but only finds a man lying at the foot of one of the escalators. In a bare room Pernat tries to convince the shop assistant to go away with him but she is happy and will not leave. Outside Pernats room, at the top of the stairs, a man in the shadow now gives Pernat a set of clothes.The establishment declares that the experiment is not working and tell the doctors that Pernat is to be dealt with. Pernat goes to the superintendent, Mr Holtrum, to return his watch and the vial of blood from his son, but Mr Holtrum has been murdered. An engraving chisel, previously used by Pernat, sticks out of his neck. At the police station Pernat is accused of murder and when he insists the vial of blood is that of the son, Pernat is told that Mr Holtrum had no son. In his prison cell Pernat meets another criminal, who admits to a sex killing and notes that he is for the chop. Pernat offers him his piece of bread but he declines as he must have an empty stomach. As he says this he is undressing and a scar can be seen running down his chest. The criminal describes how he slit open the chest of the girl with all the dolls - his victim was Miriam, the shop assistant.Pernat is released and returns to the repository to pick up his items and rips the numbered tag from the coat. The coat check man remembers Pernat from last time and admits that he was given the wrong coat, but he won't return Pernat's original items to him. Pernat looks again at the building as he leaves but now there are no window panes and the ground is covered in litter. Pernat goes back to his room and on the stairs is Rozyna, playing with dolls as a child would. Pernat crushes the skull of the doll in her hands. The top of the stairs is no longer in shadow and his door is open. The floor is covered with white rats and the room has been trashed yet some of the grains have grown into wheat. Pernat takes a wheat stork and leaves the room. Now, in the light, he notices a rat come out from behind a boarded up door opposite his room. He breaks through to another trashed room with a large oven on the opposite wall. It contains the charred corpse of a man. Pernat lays the wheat stork, the numbered coat tag and the coat on the body. A band begins to play in the street outside and he runs down the stairs then outside to catch up with the band. Pernat picks up a stick and some rubbish to use as a cymbol and joins the band as they disappear around the corner. The film ends with an official announcement saying that the public should not believe the rumours about a post nuclear, biological, humanity reconstruction programme. A man shouts from a podium. His face hangs on a large poster behind him. He holds a coat tag similar to the one we have just seen. This man looks a lot like Pernat, but with glasses."

In exchange for an early release from a French prison, they are being set up as a lesbian dance act the Flamingo Club in Las Palmas, where Cecile is secretly tasked with looking out for any activities that may have to do with human trafficking.Meanwhile, erotic film star Adriana Rinaldi (Susan Hemingway) is abducted from her palatial home, sexually assaulted, hypnotized with a fire opal gem and then sold as the willing sex slave of a millionaire.The Spanish version opens with the hypnosis of a girl named Estrella, preparing her to become the sex slave of one Aristobulas Farquas.As the girls begin rehearsing at the Flamingo Club, they are unwittingly being sized up for abduction by the white slavers, led by Irina Forbes (Joëlle Le Quément) wielder of the irresistibly hypnotic fire opal. That evening Cecile spots a recording star, Joanne Simon (Taylor in the English version), being held as a sex slave at a house she was ordered to watch. Leaving Brigitte to look after Senator Connolly -- who is investigating the white slave trade for the U.S. -- Cecile returns to her room to find a body in her closet, which the nonplussed artistic director Milton has removed. Cecile has accepted an invitation to join the Forbes at their home for a threesome, but the Forbes are on to her -- aware that she is working for the police -- and snatch her as she leaves the club the next day. She awakens to find herself in the Forbes' dungeon, where Estrella Shelby lies chained to a wall, gibbering about being reunited with Aristobulas Farquas.When the kidnappers come for Estrella, they fail to notice that Cecile has exchanged clothes with her, and she manages to escape before they can load her into the waiting helicopter. Fortunately, the ubiquitous Milton witnesses the kidnapping, and has followed Cecile to the Forbes' lair. He rescues her from the pursuing helicopter, and leaves her in the care of a group of cave-dwelling hippies.The kidnappers next go after Brigitte, snatching her from Senator Connolly's hotel room. Meanwhile, Milton meets up with Mr. Morales, owner of the home where Joanne Simon is being held, to give him the incriminating photos that Cecile took earlier. Morales orders him to kill Cecile -- unaware that Milton is also a government agent who, coincidentally, is in love with Cecile.Connolly is told by the Spanish consul that the Forbes are actually double agents collaborating with the government while meeting the demands of their overseers, an all-powerful international terrorism organization. We learn, however, that the consul and his cronies are actually behind the kidnappings, and operating on the orders of a group called ""Central"", have Connolly assassinated.The kidnappers lure Cecile back to the Flamingo Club in order to rescue Brigitte. She arrives in time to see Brigitte die, turns to confront the Forbes, and is promptly hypnotized by Irina's fire opal. Meanwhile, ""Central"" continues to clean up loose ends, murdering Morales, his son and the unfortunate Joanne Simon.While Irina is torturing Cecile, Milton turns to his hippie friends -- the only people who can be trusted -- and mounts a rescue in which the Forbes are killed and Cecile is saved. They wisely decide to flee the country..."

Now her ex-husband goes to a lawyer because he wants to sue the government for keeping him away from his children.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> In 1960's Buffalo, New York, divorced Thomas Hacklin, Jr. is an honest, hard working working class stiff who adores his two young children, Andy and Junie, more than anything in the world. His ex-wife Ruthie has custody of the children, but Tom has all the access he wants to them. Tom doesn't like Ruthie's new boyfriend, Jack Scolese, and Jack spending time with his children, but he isn't quite sure what it is about Jack he doesn't like. Indeed, Jack is a low level mobster trying to make his way up, which he attempts to do by masterminding a major daytime bank robbery. It doesn't go quite the way Jack envisions as his mob bosses provide him no support in the matter. So Tom is not happy when he learns of the robbery, Jack's arrest and the fact that Ruthie has married him. Sam Marzetta of the Buffalo PD and Jason Reid of the Justice Department convince Jack to testify against his mob bosses in return for protection for him and his new family in the witness relocation program. So one day when Tom routinely goes to pick up his children from Ruthie's, he finds that all three have vanished without a trace. He eventually does learn that the authorities have in a sense taken away his children. With the help and advice from his new girlfriend and eventual second wife Ali, Tom uses whatever means possible - including legal and political - to find his children. The police won't even talk to him until he starts legal proceedings to sue them and the government. But when these proper channels don't seem to be getting him anywhere, he decides he needs to take matters into his own hands, which isn't easy as the authorities do whatever they can to hide Jack, Ruthie and kids from Tom, while the mob does whatever it can, including using Tom, to find Jack.—Huggo"

Nirmala admonishes Chander for smoking, in front of everybody in the house. Manju continues to make snide comments at Inder. Inder gets back at her at the monthly health check-up by saying that she has high BP and needs an injection (with a long needle) to get better.. Manju screams and runs away..
Manju gets Inder scolded for yelling inside the house (she whispers in front of Inder, prompting him to shout). In response, Inder takes Manju's shoes and puts mud prints all over the dining floor. Manju is caught and is asked to clean the floor as per the rules. But then Inder steps up and admits to his prank and Nirmala makes him clean the floor.Inder (Rakesh Roshan), a young doctor, slowly grows close to Manju. Together they hatch a plan to bring the family together for some fun. Manju reaches out to Jagan and pretends to share his love in music and learns about the interests of others.. Dwarka likes fertilizers, Sunder and Chander play cards (at the office), Bari Bhabhi likes dancing and so on..
She then reaches out to everyone and engages them in their favorite activities when Nirmala is away from home for her social work.. Slowly the house members learn about each other hobbies and interests and get closer themselves. For example Dwarka turns out to be a tabla master..
Inder wants to marry Manju and formally proposes to her. Manju tries to get closer to Nirmala but she rebuffs her every attempt..Manju also attracts the attention of Dwaraka Prasad, who was a fun loving fellow himself. He feels relieved with the presence of the playful Manju after living for a long time under the controlling behavior of his wife. Manju gradually gains the trust of everyone in the house except Nirmala. Dwarka talks to Nirmala about Manju for Inder, but Nirmala refuses saying that Manju is too selfish and can only take care of herself and not others..One day, Manju performs a small play highlighting the tyranny of Nirmala over other family members. Nirmala was not believed to be at the house, but she accidentally sees it. She gets hurt as everyone thinks of her as a dictator, though she does everything for the well being of the family. Moreover, the fact that everyone felt free with Manju, an outsider, but not with her, hurts her more.
Manju tries to apologize, but Nirmala wouldn't talk to her. All family members except Dwarka (coz he is not allowed to travel), Nirmala and Manju go to attend a wedding.Dwaraka Prasad, seeing her adamant, gets emotionally upset and rants at her, which leads to him having a heart attack. Nirmala gets tensed as everyone except Manju left home for some wedding.
Manju acts timely and saves Dwaraka Prasad (she yells at the heart specialist Dr Gokhale and remind him his oath, when he tries to act pricey and busy and refuses to attend to Swarka). Manju organizes all medicines and a nurse and even informs the family members who return from the wedding. Manju works day and night to take care of Dwarka.
At last, Nirmala understands Manju's character and she too approves of her. As soon as the family members return, Manju leaves for the station without saying goodbye. Nirmala takes Inder and stops Manju at the station and accepts her as part of the family.
In the end, Manju and Inder get married."

Things in his life become complicated when his brother and a number of fellow smugglers are murdered by a rival smuggler from France, known as the Marsigliese, whom is determined to become drug kinpin of Italy and wipe out all competion. Luca must join forces with rival Naples smugglers, a powerful Italian Mafia, as well as the local police to track down the French sadist when he abducts Luca's wife.—Matt Patay Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assasins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (think Sonny Corlone's death scene in 'The Godfather'), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino. That night, Luca breaks into Scherino's house, but gets spotted and severely beaten up by Scherino's henchmen. However, Scherino spares Luca's life and instead has him thrown out of the house. He tells Luca that he's got it all wrong: he had no part in Mickey's killing.After Luca recovers from his injuries thanks to a local doctor named Charlie (Giordano Falzoni) who treats injuries for large bribes of cash, Luca meets with an informant who gives him a tip to who ordered the hit on Mickey. Traveling to a derelict fishing boat in the marina where a hood is making a drug pick-up, Luca tortures him for information about his boss, whom Luca learns is a Frenchman called Francois Jacios, aka: The Marsigliese. Luca calls Perlante, who tells him more about the vicious gangster, and who is muscling into Italian organized crime to deal in hard drugs. At his hideout in Naples, the Marsigliese (Marcel Bozzufi) is meeting Ingrid, a German drug courier from Frankfurt wanting to sell him some heroin. When the Marsigliese sees that the heroin is 'cut', he has her face horribly burned by a blowtorch while he watches with sadistic satisfaction.Over the course of one day, the Marsigliese orders a series of shootings of all the rival Mafia Dons all over Naples as part of his plan to become the sole kingpin of Naples. Perlante barely escapes an attempt on his life when his right-hand man Alfredo (Giulio Farnese) triggers a bomb which has been hidden under Perlante's bed, killing Alfredo and Perlante's mistress. Perlante calls Luca and tells him about the series of hits. He sets up a meeting between them and the Marsigliese at the local soccer stadium where the Frenchman discusses merging their criminal concerns. Afterwards, Luca meets with his fellow smugglers and persuades them not to accept the Marsigliese demands for the inflow of drugs into their community would only escalate the number of addicts and drug-overdoses, plus they would not receive any profits since the Marsigliese would keep most of the money for himself and his close associates.In response to the Mafia killings, the Naples police chief (Fabio Jovine) orders Captain Tarantino (Venantino Verantini) to conduct a massive sweep of the Neapolitan bay area to clean it up of crime. The dragnet has many smugglers arrested. Luca is saved from a police raid on his house by, of all people, Scherino, who suggests they form an alliance to defeat the Marsiglise. They meet that night at Perlante's house to discuss their plans with him. But Luca soon smells the tell-tale odor of the Marsiglieses personal 'parfum' in the room. Luca realizes that Perlante is in league with the Marsgliese just as the gangster and his henchmen burst into the room and kill all of Scherino's henchmen as well as mortally wound Scherino himself. Luca's split-second reflexes of diving out a glass window and running away from the house ensures his escape. The mortally wounded Scherino manages to shoot off one shot from his gun at the treaterous Perlante, hitting him in the neck, before he drops dead himself.The Marsigliese abducts Luca's wife, Adale, and again insists that Luca should turn over the smuggling network over to his drug operation. To help Luca make up his mind, the sound of Adale being beaten and gang-raped are relayed to Luca over the phone. Luca agrees to the Marsigliese demands. In desperation, Luca calls upon the elderly Don Morrone (Guido Alberti), the leader of the old-guard Italian Mafia who has been reading the news throughout the movie of the numerous killings. Morrone is more then happy to come out of semi-retirement to deal with the French sadist. Morrone relays his plans to his various middle-aged associates who swing back into action for their cause.The following morning, at a meeting between Luca and the Marsigliese in a local open square where the handover to Adele is taking place, Luca sees that it is indeed a set up to have him killed. Then Don Morrone and his men, using a series of hit-and-run attacks, appear and blast away all of the Marsigliese's henchmen. Luca then chases the crazed Marsigliese through the deserted streets and allyways where after the Frenchman runs down an alley which is a dead end, Luca catches up to him and shoots the Marsigliese dead who lands on a pile of garbage bags. Across down, the police raid the Marsigliese hideout where they find the tramatized Adele and a large stash of cocaine and heroin, while the rest of the Marsigliese henchmen surrender.The final scene has Captain Tarantino meeting with Don Morrone and his housekeeper at a wharf marketplace where the policeman thanks the elderly Mafia don for his tip leading to the discovery of the Marsigliese hideout and drug shipment seizure. But when Tarantino asks Morrone about the murder of the Marsigliese and his men, Morrone claims to know nothing about it, and also not to know Luca Di Angelo. From Tarantino's sarcastic tone of voice, he knows that Morrone is lying. But out of sympathy, the policeman lets Morrone go without arresting him."

Randhir the losing engineer and ex-lover of Sheetal (Parveen Babi) swears revenge and leaves.As the three friends celebrate Vinod's success, Seema leaves for a pilgrimage. Ashok hears that his father has died. He rushes to his funeral also to find out that his entire wealth is debt-ridden and he is left with nothing. As he is still recovering, he gets a letter from Seema breaking off their relationship stating that she was interested in him as a rich man and since he is now poor, she is not interested anymore. Heartbroken, Ashok leaves town.Six years pass by. Vinod has completely focused on building the train, completely ignoring his wife and son. On the day of the train's inauguration, she comes to fetch him for their anniversary party. He refuses to go since the next day is the day of the train's inaugural journey. Heartbroken, she puts her son, Raju, on the train to go to her mother, and leaves Vinod. Iftekhar, their boss, asks Vinod to go to Mumbai by flight for the arrival of the train. Vinod refuses saying that he needs to be in the control room. So his assistant and friend, Rakesh (Vinod Mehra) goes instead.The train starts from New Delhi where a lot of the characters board the train. Prem Nath is a devout Hindu priest. Om Shiv Puri is a royal king, Raja Mam Mohan, traveling with his wife Padmini. Ranjeet is a smuggler fleeing with stolen diamonds and his girlfriend Raziya. Sujeet Kumar is an undercover police officer dressed as a Christian priest and following Ranjeet the smuggler. Asrani is an ex-Army Colonel P.K. Bhandari. Keshto Mukherjee and Paintail are traveling without tickets hiding in train's lavatories. Simi Grewal is a school teacher, taking a group of students on a visit to Mumbai. Neetu Singh is fleeing home to escape a forced marriage. Ravi (Jeetendra) is a small-time thief who tries to befriend Neetu Singh in order to steal her jewelry. Seema is traveling to Mumbai with her cousin (Navin Nischol), who is a doctor. Rakesh's pregnant wife is traveling to Mumbai with her mother. Ashok also quietly boards the train so that he can be a part of his friend Vinod's success and is shocked to see Seema. he sees her with her cousin and mistakes him as her husband. He snaps at her before she can say anything, but befriends Raju after recognizing him.Unknown to all of them, Randhir (the engineer who swore revenge) has put a bomb in the engine at the Mathura Railway station and disengaged the vacuum brakes so that even guard wouldn't be able to stop the train. The bomb was timed to explode halfway through the journey. He hopes to sabotage the train and thereby destroy Vinod's reputation without a scant thought to the lives of the passengers. Meanwhile Ashok leaves the train as he does not wanted to travel with Seema in the train. He meets Randheer in a bar where Randheer tells him that he has fulfilled his and Ashok's revenge. (He was misunderstood that Ashok must be seeking revenge from Seema for her betrayal). Knowing this Ashok immediately leaves to catch the train before explosion time so that he can save his friend's train and save passengers. He manages to catch the train at Kota Railway station, but was unfortunately late.Halfway, the bomb explodes killing the drivers Jeevan Lal and Dango, and destroying the brakes and accelerator. Ashok goes outside the train and goes to the engine compartment and saves the guard (Osman Ali) and brings him back. Vinod, who is desperately trying to save their lives, talks to them through All India Radio and asks them to go to the engine compartment and apply the emergency brakes.The radio broadcast completely panics all passengers and the train cooks come running to find out what happened. In their haste, they leave the cooking gas on. The news also panics all the relatives who are waiting at Mumbai and they besiege Vinod. Sheetal also comes to him and shouts at him asking him to save their son, Raju.Ashok, Ravi and the guard climb on top of the train and try to reach the engine. Meanwhile, Rakesh's wife enters labor and Seema's doctor cousin attends to her, asking for some hot water. A cook lights a match to heat up some water in the kitchen. The open gas explodes killing the guard Osman Ali, the cook and several passengers and half the train starts burning. Ashok and Ravi barely make it back and with the help of some passengers put up some gaps between the burning compartments and the passengers.
Vinod tries another effort by sending a helicopter and trying to get someone to land on the engine compartment. Randhir sabotages this mission by volunteering to go on the helicopter. He drops on to the engine compartment but does nothing leading Ashok and his superiors to believe he is dead.Meanwhile Ashok finds out why Seema left him. She had lost her leg on the way back from the pilgrimage. She didn't want to be a burden on him in his poverty and decided to go away. They patch up. Ravi and Neetu also fall in love. Sheetal also comes back to Vinod and apologizes for her behavior. She gives him courage for his last attempt to save the train.Rakesh, who is in Mumbai, tries to build a steep incline quickly which will reduce the speed of the train once it reaches Mumbai and may yet stop the train but he is running out of time as the train is speeding towards Mumbai and is just hours from reaching it.
Vinod tries one last effort by getting an engine to drive along the Super fast train. He asks Ashok and Ravi to come up top and throws a rope saying that he will come over to the train and stop the train himself. Ranjeet tries to escape by using the same rope to the other train knowing that he will be arrested in Mumbai. Asrani tries to stop but Ranjeet throws him off the train. Ashok fights Ranjeet who falls off the train. Vinod comes over to the train.He says that he has brought fireproof suits and some dynamite(just in case). They will wear fireproof suits and go to the engine and apply the emergency brakes. Vinod, Ashok and Ravi go through the fire to the engine where they find Randhir. Randhir tries to kill Vinod but falls off the train in the scuffle.They reach the engine to find that the drivers are dead and all systems have failed. Ashok comes up with an idea of blasting the couplings of the compartments from the engine. Vinod disagrees saying that passenger compartments will derail if blasted off at this speed, but then remembers the incline being built by Rakesh. They send Ravi back to warn the passengers and to ask everyone to tie themselves to their seat.Vinod asks Rakesh over wireless to clear the incline area even though it isn't completely ready and then Ashok and he set up the dynamite charges on the couplings. As the train starts climbing the incline, they blast the dynamite and jump off the slowing engine. The engine blasts through Mumbai station and stops on the road. But the passenger compartment slows down and comes to a complete halt. All passengers get off safely. Vinod and Ashok happily come walking they're hurt but alive.
Everyone connects with their relatives and the film ends as a tribute to the soul of India."

Rude Boy,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081441/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young British punk and roadie for The Clash navigates life in socially torn 1970s England. Rude Boy is a semi-documentary, part character study, part 'rockumentary', featuring a British punk band, The Clash. The script includes the story of a fictional fan juxtposed with actual public events of the day, including political demonstrations and Clash concerts. Filmed over a period of years, the written dialog takes on the appearance of improvisation.—Edmund Nasjleti <ena375@map.com> Rude Boy is part documentary and part short film centering on punk band, The Clash and one of their ""roadies""(he's really more of a tag along as he is somewhat lazy and doesnt appear to have any technical knowledge on setting up or fixing sound or music equipment.) by the name of Ray Gange, who is actually one of the writers and directors of the film. The film takes place between the bands release of their explosive debut album and its follow up, the very underrated, ""Give 'Em Enough Rope""(an album that has largly been cast aside solely because of its more radio friendly production brought about by Sandy Pearlman who was seen as unfit to work with a a punk band because he had previously worked with bands such as Blue Oyster Cult.)
Ray the roadie plays the foil by being somewhat dim and spouting off knee jerk conservative statements to which the rest of the band, in particular, Joe Strummer, can respond and react to. The film captures the tension on the streets of London in the late 70s as economic disaster seems to loom overhead and many begin to look for scapegoats in the form of non white immigrants. The conservative political group, the National Front takes this cue to fan the fires of race war in the streets and groups like The Clash both observed and addressed these issues in their music at a time when no other bands would outside of the punk music scene. The film features live footage from some very legendary shows such as the rock against racism rally held in Victoria Park and attended by over 100,000 people. The Clash is seen on camera at its peak and the film offers some rare opportunities to see the band in a more candid setting than on stage or in a planned interview. a must see for fans of punk rock and really music in general."

He was recruited by Shakaal, to assassinate Shiv, by holding Rakesh's wife hostage.Rakesh confesses that he deliberately missed Shiv on the two previous instances, hoping it would buy him time to rescue his wife.

The trio seek the aid of a homeless cripple, Abdul (Mazhar Khan) and manage to find and destroy Shakaal's contraband warehouse in the city. Finding that Abdul was providing Ravi and Vijay with information, Shakaal has his men kill him. Enraged with the destruction of his warehouses, Shakaal kidnaps Sheetal and has her brought to his island.Vijay, Ravi and Rakesh fume, knowing that Sheetal will almost certainly be killed and that they have no clue about the location of Shakaal's island. At this point, Jagmohan (Mac Mohan), another of Shakaal's aides who has been mercilessly crippled by him, offers his help to the group to gain entry to Shakaal's hideout.
Posing as a musical troupe (a familiar stratagem in many Bollywood films), Vijay and Ravi (with Renu, Chacha/Uncle and Sunita) enter the island and perform for Shakaal. Shakaal, however, reveals that Jagmohan was sent by him to trap them. Jagmohan's fracture was a lie. Their cover is blown and they are captured.An elaborate sequence ensues as the three men escape. The trio and the widow avoid the booby traps (Vijay is dropped into a tank with the crocodiles and Ravi+Rakesh are in a poison gas filled enclosure fighting 2 of Shakaals men who have gas masks on) and the henchmen ultimately capture Shakaal and finally end his ignominious existence. Shakaal, with his dying breath, sets his island hideout to blow up, but the heroes escape via helicopter to safety."

Jagdish (Mohan Gokhale) is Anirudh's assistant at home & office. Anirudh has a dark and lonely existence for the most part. He is fiercely independent and even doesn't allow Jagdish to do all his chores.
One day, while on his way to the doctor, he hears a lovely song and ends up mesmerized at the singer's door instead of the doctor that he was looking for.The voice belongs to Kavita Prasad (Shabana Azmi), a young woman recently widowed after three years of marriage. Kavita, too, prefers a secluded existence. Her childhood friend Manju (Sudha Chopra), is the only friend she has.
Manju throws a small party where Kavita and Anirudh meet again. He recognizes her from her voice. During the conversation, he mentions that the school is looking for volunteers to read, sing, teach handicrafts and spend time with the children. Kavita is reluctant, but she is urged by Manju and her husband Suresh to strongly consider it. Manju takes Kavita to the school when it holds a stall for Diwali candles made by students. Kavita sees that the students are talented and run the entire stall by themselves, without any help. They make beautiful candles.
Kavita decides to volunteer.On day one Anirudh warns Kavita not to see blind kids as ""poor souls"".. he says the kids need help and not charity. Kavita takes some time to adjust to the sightless lives of the kids and to adjust to their sensitivities.As Kavita spends more time at the school, she begins forming a friendship with Anirudh. The friendship grows stronger over time. But their personalities and feelings are different. Anirudh is of strong character. He firmly believes that the blind need help but not pity or charity. (When once, in his office, Kavita attempts to assist him with coffee, he gets enraged at the thought of his guest offering to overcome his obvious difficulty with hospitality.)
Kavita helps the kids start playing blind cricket, using a special ball that makes rattles. The school prepares for their annual function and Kavita helps the student prepare a skit based on the Mahabharata. Kavita reveals to Anirudh that her husband died 3 yrs ago.
The kids also love Kavita and get very close to her. A student names Paplu is infatuated with Kavita and is not able to express his complex feelings for her. Paplu is jealous of a fellow student Rampyare who is a favorite of Kavita. Paplu is not blind, but Rampyare is. Paplu picks up a fight with Rampyare, and he closes his eyes to make the contest equal. But when Kavita finds them fighting, she slaps Paplu only and takes care of Rampyare.
Anirudh starts frequently visiting Kavita at her house and spends time with her. Still, Anirudh has deep rooted inferiority complex against anyone who looks at him with a sense of pity or charity. He loses his temper frequently at such instances.Manju notices that Kavita is now happy and looks forward to life. Eventually Kavita proposes to Anirudh, despite his feeling that Kavita is doing favors to him and to the school. Anirudh accepts her proposal.
Anirudh finds that Paplu has told his uncle that he wants to become blind. He believes that he is mistreated because he can see. Kavita realizes her mistake and takes care of Paplu. Anirudh and Kavita get engaged.Kavita, recently bereaved, looks to the school (and Anirudh) as a way towards an ideal, one of sacrificial service. Anirudh gets wind of this (when Suresh mentions this at their engagement party) and assumes Kavita is simply seeking to fill the void in her life with this form of service. He assumes she accepted the proposal, not out of love, but as a sacrifice towards a way out of her dark life. During this time, Anirudh's fellow blind friend Dubey (Om Puri) laments that his recently deceased wife was not happy in their marriage. Dubey says that he was independent before marriage, but got dependent on her with time and became useless.Anirudh is shaken, confused, and disturbed by all this. He breaks off the engagement (but does not mention the reason to Kavita). She accepts his decision.
Kavita, now a salaried employee of the school, continues to help the children. The initial coldness between her and Anirudh gives way to friction and eventually, over a series of events at the school, brings up the feelings they were not able to discuss before. Kavita is given the charge to prepare the school for a handicraft expo. She decides to bring in outside consultants without asking Anirudh, which annoys him. Anirudh feels that blind children should be self sustainable, without any help from a sighted person. Kavita feels that some guidance from anyone is not wrong at all.
Kavita later admonishes Anirudh for not procuring any new book for the library in the last 2 yrs. Anirudh retorts that no new braille books have been published in the last 3 yrs. Anirudh then scolds Kavita for not learning braille herself.
The situation spirals downward and one of them must leave the school. Anirudh wants Kavita to stop coming to school. Anirudh calls her an ""outsider"". But Kavita refuses to leave as she feels this is her school as well. Later, she finds that Anirudh has asked for a transfer to Kanpur. Kavita admits defeat and decides to leave the school as the school needs him more than her.Manju finds out that Anirudh has broken up the engagement and speaks to him. She makes Anirudh realize that even Kavita has a complex that she was somehow betraying her first husband by loving Anirudh, and so she created a story that her love is motivated by a higher calling of sacrifice.
The movie ends with Anirudh and Kavita being touched by the depth of their feelings for one another and finally seeing a way out."

The woman's name was Nagi Lahanya (Smita Patil). She was married tribal woman.
Lahanya Bhiku (Om Puri) is her husband, who has been arrested for her murder. Bhiku is brought from jail to cremate his wife's body.Bhaskar Kulkarni (Naseeruddin Shah) is a lawyer appointed by the court to defend Bhiku, as Bhiku cannot afford a lawyer on his own. Dushane (Amrish Puri) is the public prosecutor. Bhiku doesn't say a single word in court. Bhiku's father (Nana Palsikar) and sister (Bhagyashree Kotnis) attend the court proceedings, as the sister manages Bhiku's baby boy.Bhaskar meets Bhiku in lock up, but even then Bhiku doesn't say a single word. Bhaskar assumes that Bhiku has murdered his wife and suspects that she was having an affair.At night, Bhiku is shown to be in intense pain in lock-up.
Bhasker is junior to Dushane and also his student. Bhaskar is worried that his career will be impacted when he loses the case. Dushane encourages Bhaskar to fight the case without worrying about the outcome. Dushane plays bridge with Dr Vasant M. Patil (Arvind Deshpande) and Bhonsle (Mohan Agashe), chairman, Zilla Parishad. The group includes MLA Ganpatrao & the DSP.
Dr Patil did the Post Mortem on Nagi.More (Achyut Potdar), is a forest contractor in the area where Nagi's dead body was found. Bhiku's father and sister work for More in the same forest, cutting trees.
Bhaskar tries to make inquires in a local newspaper about the news of Nagi's death, but the editor Samant refuses to share any details and asks Bhaskar to leave. Bhaskar is being followed.Through Bhiku's nightmares we learn that Nagi was being lured by More, with promise of biscuits and new clothes. Bhiku was angry with Nagi as he knew More was going to touch her body one day. Bhiku was madly in love with Nagi.
Bhaskar travels to Bhiku's home to find more information and meets his father and sister. Even the family refuses to speak to Bhaskar.
A social worker (Mahesh Elkunchwar) sees Bhaskar trying to talk to the family in their village. The social worker introduces himself to Bhaskar and tries to understand Bhaskar view on the case. Bhaskar explains the work done so far, and the fact that nobody is willing to share anything. The Social worker says that he came to the village after Nagi's death.That night, Bhaskar finds Samant thrashed and bleeding on the road. More updates Dushane about the thrashing delivered to Samant.
Bhaskar gets increasingly frustrated that nobody will speak to him about this case. Bhaskar is attacked at his house that night.
Bhaskar meets Dr Patil the next day, who asks him to meet at 9 pm. Bhaskar visits Bhiku's village to meet his father and sister again. But he finds the father drunk.
At 9 pm, Bhaskar finds Samant coming out of Dr Patil's clinic. But he is told that Dr Patil is not in his clinic and has gone outside. That night Bhaskar is stabbed in the arm in a desolate street.Bhaskar pleads the court for police protection, but Dushane objects saying that there is no proof to link the attack on Bhaskar to the Bhiku case. Bhaskar argues that justice is the responsibility of the court, and court orders to provide Police protection to Bhaskar.
That night, while the policeman slept outside Bhaskar's house, an unknown person tried to speak to Bhaskar, but Bhaskar was afraid and did not open the door to let the person in.The trial begins. Dushane contends that Bhiku tried to sell Nagi into prostitution to fulfill his desire for booze. When Nagi resisted, he killed her.
Dushane produces a witness who says that he saw Bhiku looking down the well, where Nagi's body was later found. The witness says that Bhiku was drunk, and he walked away from the well.Bhaskar is followed by an unknown person on the beach, when the policeman was looking elsewhere. Bhaskar runs away and takes refuge in a private house near the beach.
Bhaskar reaches out to Dushane and narrates the incident, and Dushane connects him to the DSP. The DSP says that the unknown person was a policeman who was simply approaching Bhaskar for a matchstick.In the trial, Dushane produces many witnesses who say that Bhiku was in their debt, and he always offered to send Nagi to them to settle his debts.
That night, the social worker meets Bhaskar in secret. He says that Nagi was raped and murdered by More, Bhonsle, Dr Patil and the DSP. Bhiku was opposing More and Bhonsle and this was their plan to suppress his self-respect. But there is no proof.Bhaskar meets Bhiku in lock-up again. He beseeches him to speak up. Bhiku is still silent.
In court, Dr Patil testifies that there were no signs of rape on Nagi. There were scratch marks on the shoulders and the abdominal area, but Patil says that the marks were from Nagi being dragged on the ground. Bhaskar contends that Dr Patil did not conduct a full and thorough investigation into the cause of Nagi's death.
Bhiku remembers mentally how Nagi was called to More's house at night. Bhiku followed her and heard her screams and tried to rescue her, but he was drunk and was easily subdued by More's men.Bhaskar cross-examines one of More's men. The person breaks down during cross questioning and even Dushane is not able to save him. The person admits that on 24th Dec 1978, there was a party at More's bungalow. Bhiku came there that night and created a ruckus.
But before Bhaskar could get the full story, Dushane asks the court to be adjourned since it is already 5 pm.That night, the social worker visits Bhiku's family, but he is abducted in front of the family as a clear warning.
Next day Bhonsle reaches out to Bhaskar and offers him a large case in Bombay. Bhaskar refuses the opportunity. Bhonsle indicates that the social worker has now been killed.
Bhiku's father dies in the jungle. Bhiku is allowed to attend his father's funeral. Bhiku's sister is now without any protection.
At the funeral, Bhiku murders his own sister with an ax. He screams in anguish. He did this to prevent his sister's rape.
Bhaskar is adamant to fight Bhiku's case. Dushane tells Bhaskar that if he dies in the pursuit of justice, Dushane will treat it as an accident and not as connected to Bhiku's case."

Van a casa de un hombre que consideran de confianza, pero hay un invitado presente, otro hombre marroquí con bigote, que al Muertes le da muy mala espina. En cuanto la venta está hecha, ese hombre se va. El Jato conduce el cuatrolatas por una serpenteante carretera sin asfaltar, y en ese momento son objeto de una emboscada. El marroquí que había sido testigo de la venta les ha seguido, y ahora, con todos sus compinches armados, la valentía de El Muertes a la hora de enfrentarse a ellos no servirá de nada. Los dos amigos se quedan tirados, sólamente con una maleta desvencijada: ni dinero, ni chocolate, ni coche y una botella a medias. Bebiendo de una botella de alcohol que les han dejado, Jato anima a su compañero diciéndole ""Bebe, que aquí estuvo la legión!""Jato llama a Magda (Paloma Gil), su novia, para pedirle dinero y ayuda. Sin embargo, están de suerte. En cuanto llegan a la ciudad más cercana, encuentran por casualidad al marroquí que les robó en la calle, él solito. Lo siguen hasta unos váteres públicos. El Jato le da una paliza, así que el hombre acaba devolviéndoles todo, el chocolate, el dinero y todo. Magda ha pedido 2.000 pesetas a su madre, teóricamente para comprarse un bañador e ir a la sierra madrileña a casa de su amiga Lola. La madre, Magdalena, (Encarna Paso), se pone echa una furia, diciéndole que no hace nada, que su habitación está hecha una pocilga, que es mucho dinero. El padre, Ramón, (Agustín González), no le da importancia al asunto; dice que (probablemente), sólo es un bañador, y no hay que montar tanto escándalo por nada, pero la madre dice que él tiene la sangre de horchata y que sólo se preocupa de ver la tele.Al final, Jato y Muertes han pasado el chocolate a través de unas aduanas vetustas y abarrotadas en el fondo oculto de una maleta. Afuera, Magda los está esperando, y se preocupa porque si sus padres llaman a casa de Lola se enterarán de que no está con ella. El novio de Magda le dice que algún día tendrá que irse de casa de sus padres para vivir con él. Ya en Madrid, parece que Jato y Muertes consiguieron el dinero y el chocolate, pero no un coche, así que Muertes roba uno para los tres. Muertes dice que él es un padrino. Un hombre gordo y su mujer aparecen gritando ""ladrón, ladrón"". Muertes les grita por la ventanilla ""viaja en metro, gordo"", pero María, la mujer, piensa que ha llamado cabrón a su marido.En casa, la madre de Madga se ha dado cuenta de que ella faltaba y dice en casa que se les estropeó el coche. La madre estaba preocupadísima, y ya había llamado a un primo suyo, Antonio, que era comisario. Le echan la bronca a Magda, pero no parece que ella haga mucho caso. En una fiesta, Magda ve como la gente se besa, toma drogas, fuma... Jato apoda ""Garbanzo"" a Magda. Ellos van a casa de la ""Marquesa"", una mujer supuestamente lesbiana, mientras Muertes va a meterse un pico porque siente que el síndrome de abstinencia se acerca. Jato le dice de manera desagradable a Magda que espere por él en la calle o en el pub de la esquina; como ella no quiere quedarse sola, ve como una gorda mujer mayor paga a Jato en efectivo, una parte por el chocolate, y otra por echarle un polvo. Mientras, Muertes va a comprar su pico, pero le debe tanto dinero a su camello que éste no quiere fiarle más. Desesperado, Muertes le saca una navaja, con lo que el camello accede a darle la dosis del día. Muertes corre a un váter a inyectarse la droga en vena.Una sabelotodo, hija de un diplomático, dice que el costo es bueno. Magda tiene que irse a casa - quizás empieza a darse cuenta de que las promesas de Jato de vivir en una casa con ella no son muy plausibles. Están con el hijo de un conde (Pedro Velázquez) que no tiene un duro. Ésta es la primera vez que Magda fuma costo, y tose constantemente. La hija del diplomático y el hijo del conde se ríen de ella, pero Magda quiere hacerse la mayor, y ser una más de la pandilla. Magda se siente sóla en el mundo, sin familia ni amigos. En cambio Muertes y Jato no tienen nada que perder, y hacen bandera de ser proletarios de Vallecas.Muertes ha montado una orgía para un hombre homosexual llamado Abelardo, y lo graba diciendo cosas como ""no me llames Abelardo, llámame Juanita"" mientras follaba, y amenaza con darle la cinta a los directivos de la empresa Fátima S.A. El tal Abelardo le suelta 20.000 pesetas por su silencio. Muertes le da la cinta ""para que se excite él solito"", y le amenaza por si va por ahí contando sus experiencias con él y le espanta al resto de clientes volverá a destrozarle la vida.Cuando Magda vuelve a casa, sus padres están esperando por ella. Ramón le suelta una bofetada nada más entrar, y Magdalena le chilla y le llama golfa. Magda quiere irse de casa, pero Ramón le recuerda que es menor de edad. Magdalena se desespera, y no quiere que se vaya. Magda necesita aire. Ahora, Magdalena intenta negociar con ella. Magda llora y dice que todo le da asco. Ramón le dice que se lo piense hasta el día siguiente, porque si ellos no han sabido ser mejores padres es porque no han sabido hacerlo mejor.Jato y Muertes vuelven a casa de Jato. La señora Carmen (María Álvarez) es la típica mujer de pueblo que ha trabajado duramente toda su vida para no salir de pobre nunca; hay más niños, que están durmiendo en la chavola todos juntos. Jato odia al padre, que duerme satisfecho y roncando tranquilamente. Jato da dinero a su madre, pero le dice que no le dé ni una peseta al padre. La señora Carmen ha dicho a Muertes que él sabe más de la vida que Jato, así que tiene que cuidar de él, y a su hijo Jato le dice que no sabe lo que harían sin el dinero que él les da.En el institiuto, Magda se aburre. Muertes roba otro coche y van a recoger a Magda al instituto. Jato se acerca al parque del Retiro y les vende costo a los clientes de un kiosquero que también vende droga bajo cuerda.Una reunión de ""marujas"": se quejan de que sus maridos no cumplen con ellas en la cama, pero que con los porros se lo pasan muy bien. Muertes vuelve a ver a una de esas marujas, Anabel (Elisenda Ribas) y le ofrece 10,000 por un polvo. Muertes ya está desvistiéndose en la habitación de la dueña cuando otra mujer (Carmen Lozano) entra: ha sacado su número de un jarrón, entonces le ha tocado a ella tirárselo, porque la dueña invita. Muertes tiene que aceptar el trato, pero exclama ""Esto se avisa!"". Mientras, Jato y Magda están fumando un porro delante de una hoguera, mandan a la mierda todo lo que hay en sus vidas que no les gusta, y hacen el amor soñando con cuando puedan vivir juntos.Jato y Muertes siguen con sus trapicheos, conduciendo a lo loco. Su contacto se llama Eric. Ellos pensaban que le robarían todo, pero el asunto les ha salido terriblemente mal. Muertes acaba herido, pero su gran problema es que ahora no tiene para pincharse y el mono se acerca. Lo que se le ocurre hacer es decirle a Magda que se haga pasar por virgen con el Sapo (José Lifante) un farmacéutico que se pirra por las menores. Magda va a pedir pastillas anticonceptivas al Sapo, además cinco unidades de morfina. Como ella le ha dicho que no importa el precio, inmediatamente el farmacéutico echa el cierre a la farmacia, le regala las pastillas anticonceptivas porque ""le van a hacer falta"", y se lleva a Magda a la trastienda. El farmacéutico se llama Favio y se abalanza sobre ella. Esta vez es Magda quien tiene sexo mientras Jato se queda afuera mirando.Muertes está bien ya. Muertes les propone que se unan con él tomando paco. Para él, el riesgo de morirse es poco importante, porque la droga es el paraíso. El Holandés (Félix Navarro), que era su contacto, murió, así que la gente empieza a pensar que Muertes está quemado. Desesperado, Muertes propone que Jato haga el transporte en su nombre, ya que es de confianza. Convence a Jato y Magda porque así ganarán dinero y podrán pagar la entrada de su casita. Jato quiere dejar a Magda al margen. Muertes recuerda a Jato los días en que la señora Carmen besó la mano de Muertes, porque él les había llevado de comer después de pasar dos días sin comer nada.Magda y Jato están en su casita del campo esperando el golpe de Marbella. Sale la noticia de la muerte del Holandés en el periódico, y Magda pregunta a Jato si fue él o fue Muertes quien lo mató. Magda le dice a Jato que Muertes los arrastrará a los dos a la cárcel, pero Magda le dice que Jato ya le ha devuelto el favor mil veces. Magda quería haberse acostado sólo con Jato en su vida, pero después de lo de Favio, no hay razón para que ella no se prostituya siempre. Se les quema el besugo que están cocinando y tienen que comer de lata... otra vez.El golpe se dará a las 12:45 de la noche. Jato va a un yate donde están Ivonne (Anne Marie Rosier) y Pierre (Jacques Poisier). Resulta que la mercancía estaba oculta en un jarrón con flores en su habitación de hotel. El francés habla por teléfono con Muertes. Ivonne quiere tirarse a Jato, lo que pone celosa a Magda. Muertes y Magda se emborrachan en su habitación de hotel para celebrar el éxito del negocio. Durante la fiesta, Muertes, insiste en inyectar a Magda con el caballo que acaban de comprar.Cuando Jato llega, ya es de día, y es demasiado tarde. Muertes y Magda están, cada uno en su cama, pasando el subidón; él le dice que no es nada, pero Jato está desesperado: ni siquiera consigue hacer despertar a Magda. Jato no es capaz de acuchillar a Muertes, pero le dice que no quiere verlo nunca más. Muertes se va de su propia habitación de hotel.Un mes después, Magda está hablando con sus amigas (Inés Lao, Isabel Marín, María Fernández y Mercedes Valdeita) de irse a una comuna hippy y de otras cosas de chicas de la época mientras se fuman unos porritos. Ella no puede dejar de rascarse la heridita del pinchazo nerviosamente. En ese momento entra Muertes, vestido de traje y con una chica del brazo, como un chulo, dándose aires. Le dice a Magda que cuando ellos quieran les dará su parte del negocio, pero ella le dice que Jato es terco y no quiere volver a verlo, pero que ella lo llamará al día siguiente.Jato y Magda vuelven a necesitar más dinero. Magda propone falsificar la firma de su padre en un cheque. Jato podría ir a Zaragoza a cobrar unos cheques que le deben a un contacto por la fuerza, pero eso a Magda le da miedo. Magda visita en persona a Muertes y de paso, le pide una dosis. Muertes le dice a su casera, doña Paula (Carmela Compani), que necesitará media hora más, y él mismo pincha a Magda. Ella, influida por la droga, le dice que tendrá que darle la pasta al día siguiente de todas formas. Por su parte, Jato registra las pertenencias de su padre mientras él sigue roncando.Cuando vuelve a Madrid, Jato busca a Magda, pero nadie la ha visto. Muertes es detenido llevando un maletín donde probablemente lleva más droga. Los dos policías (Héctor Rojkin y Ramón Gómez) lo interrogan. En realidad, lo saben casi todo: que estuvo en el golpe en Marbella, que tuvo algo que ver con la muerte del Holandés. Le dicen que Jato anda diciendo por ahí que es un hijo de puta, y le amenazan con dejarlo encerrado hasta que le venga el síndrome de abstinencia. Doña Paula es quien dice a Magda que lo detuvieron el día anterior. Magda entra en la habitación para ver si encuentra drogas, pero se desespera porque no encuentra nada.Se lo dice a Jato. Tienen una bronca, porque él no quiere volver a hablar con él. Magda le dice que Muertes siempre les ayudó a los dos cuando lo necesitaron. Mientras, el susodicho, encerrado en una celda, empieza a sentir el síndrome de abstinencia.Magda está en una discoteca, bailando. Decide llamar a su padre, Ramón, y le pide que hable con el tío Antonio, el comisario. Ramón parece acceder; lo hará al día siguiente desde la oficina, y le dice que tanto él como Magdalena quieren que vuelvan. También le da dinero. Mientras, Muertes está cada vez peor.Jato ve como pegan el tirón a unas señoras desde una moto. Jato recuerda de repente algo que dijo Magda: que Muertes también ayudó a Magda. Magda consiguió dinero de parte del Sapo, y fue a comprar droga al pub donde conoció al hijo del conde y a la hija del diplomático. El camello reconoce a Jato que Magda acaba de comprarle droga. Jato encuentra a la chica y le rompe la jeringuilla; Magda es la primera que piensa que Muertes acabará cantando. En ese momento, Muertes se golpea la cabeza contra la pared; el policía que está de guardia piensa que se ha vueltio loco por las drogas y entra en la celda. Muertes le roba la pistola y dice que el final de esta historia lo marca él, y que se lo diga al comisario. Se pegó un tiró en el corazón, por eso cuando llama Ramón, ya es demasiado tarde.Magda recibe la noticia por teléfono, y cuelga el teléfono antes de que su padre le ofrezca volver a casa. Ella y Jato van al depósito a identificiar el cadáver.El comisario (Antonio Reigosa) le dice a Jato que ha cerrado las diligencias contra él y la investigación de todo el asunto: con la muerte de Muertes ya ha tenido suficiente escarmiento.Parece que Magda va a volver a su casa. Jato se va en su moto a Zaragoza, a cobrar esos cheques. Se prometen llamarse.--escrito por KrystelClaire"

Therefore, he has a difficult relationship with his wife Marisa, his secretary/lover Claudia and his maid Teresa.During a business trip to America, his friend Arturo shows him how he solved the same problems. At Arturo's home, Enrico is astonished in seeing Caterina, a female-looking robotic maid that does all domestic chores better than a human because it doesn't need to sleep or feed. The only thing that puzzles Enrico is that the robot keeps calling Arturo by phone at regular intervals, as if to show concern like a human mate.Returning home from the trip, Enrico has again arguments with Claudia, Teresa and Marisa: he ignores Claudia's complaints (she would have him leave his wife and be with her in the public), he disapproves of Marisa having a job and a social life, and demands that Teresa perform extra activities on her evening off.Enrico resolves to break the relationship with the three women and to buy a Caterina robot for domestic duties, determined to live alone and not having to answer to anyone. At first, although spending is significant, everything seems to be going well, although Catherine shows strange (almost human) reactions and gives some strange sign of unrest during a visit from Marisa.Enrico believes that he has solved all of his problems, and starts looking for a female companion that does not demand so much as his former ones. He invites home the young and beautiful Elisabetta, whom he met at Marisa's store. The girl becomes uneasy at the sight of Caterina (as Enrico's ex-wife had been), especially after the robot seems to reject her as it did with Marisa.When Enrico and Elisabetta are about to spend the night together, Caterina loses control, plays havoc with the house and even tries to kill its master. Elisabetta panics, runs away and disappears from Enrico's life.The intervention of the engineer who built the robot is of little help: Caterina, in fact, is such a sophisticated machine that it acquired almost total autonomy from its original setting. In front of the engineer it pretends to behave, in order not to be removed and replaced, but as soon as the technician goes away, she starts imposing conditions on Enrico: she will serve him devoutly and without complaining if he will give her the respect and dedication owed to a real woman.So, when an American girl phones Enrico asking to be hosted at his home, the man vehemently answers no, in fear of a possible retaliation from the robot. The film ends with Enrico having dinner alone, duly served by Caterina in a room where she has closed all the doors like in a jail."

Bona,1980,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082093/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A female movie fan idolizes a movie bit-player who becomes her obsession. Her unrequited love for him leads to a nightmarish end. BONA loves Gardo. Gardo loves Gardo. Gardo loves going to bed with almost any woman he can attract. Once - apparently in the absence of anyone better - he even takes Bona to bed, but by the next morning, the matter seems to have slipped his mind.Bona is a grave-looking woman who drops out of school to pursue her crush on the narcissistic Gardo by moving in with him, more as a servant than anything else. Gardo, in the estimation of Bona's enraged father, is either a second- or third-rate actor in Philippine action movies.Bona (Nora Aunor) and Gardo (Philip Salvador) are the central figures in ''Bona,'' a film from the Philippines directed by Lino Brocka, whose publicity describes him as a prolific film maker and likens him to Rainer Werner Fassbinder.Prolific he may be, but, while technically unobjectionable, ''Bona,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, fails to shed much light on the wellsprings of Bona's obsessive love for Gardo. A young woman's attraction and devotion to a sleazily handsome actor are understandable, and so at first it not surprising that Bona is willing to fetch water so that Gardo can have warm baths; that she scrubs his floors and mends his clothes and cooks for him in the house they share in a poor neighborhood.But right from the start, it is also clear that Gardo is not exactly a flawless jewel of humanity: he is beaten up by the relatives of one of his women; he is a drunk; he brings home an assortment of other women; he disappears for extended periods; he leaves it to Bona to arrange an abortion for one of his lovers, and finally - after Bona has been essentially disowned by her family - Gardo informs her that he is selling the house they share and going off with another woman.About five minutes of Gardo would be enough to make most people explode. But it takes Bona about 90 minutes. And since she seems reasonably intelligent and sensitive and is alert from the outset to Gardo's slights, the writing and direction of ''Bona'' must be faulted for failing to supply dramatically valid explanations for her patience.''Bona'' is chiefly interesting as an example of Philippine film making and for its glimpses of life in the neighborhood where Bona and Gardo live.Philippine Glimpses"
