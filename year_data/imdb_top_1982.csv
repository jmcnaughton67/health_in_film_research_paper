Even if this means Elliott will lose an unexpected but dear friend.—Nick Riganas While visiting Earth one night to collect plants, a group of alien botanists is discovered and disturbed by an approaching human task force. Because of the more than hasty take-off, one of them is left behind. He finds himself all alone on a very strange planet. Fortunately, he soon finds a friend and emotional companion in Elliot, a lonely 10-year-old boy whose parents have gotten divorced. While E.T. slowly gets acquainted with Elliot's brother, Michael, sister, Gertie, and the customs of Earth, members of the task force work day and night to track down his whereabouts from outer space. The wish to go home again is strong in him, and after being able to communicate with Elliot and the others, he starts building an improvised device to send a message home for his people to come and pick him up. But before long, he gets seriously sick, and because of his special connection to Elliott. he suffers, too. The situation gets critical when the task force finally intervenes. By then, all help may already be too late, and there's no spaceship in sight.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> A group of aliens visit Earth to collect plants and one of them is left behind. He is found by a 10-year-old boy named Elliott. Soon they begin to communicate and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on Earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship. E.T. wants to go home, but if Elliott helps him, he'll lose a friend.—Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> In a forested area overlooking a sprawling suburban neighborhood, an alien spacecraft has landed. The creatures aboard have come to observe and collect specimens. One of them wanders some distance away, when strange lights and sounds cause him to hide. The group of men are led by one who has a jingling set of keys attached to a belt loop. Scared, the creature takes of running, with the men in pursuit. The creature attempts to get back to his spaceship, but it leaves without him. Eventually, it makes its way down an embankment into the suburban housing development below.In one house, a young boy named Elliot is sent out to pick up a pizza being delivered for his brother Michael and his friends. Elliot is about to return inside when a strange noise in the backyard catches his ears. Elliot traces the noise to a gardening shed in the backyard. Elliot throws a baseball into the shed, and is scared when something in the shed throws it back out. Elliot rushes inside to tell everyone, and they all come out to investigate, but find nothing in the shed, except for some strange prints, which Michael assumes must belong to some type of coyote from the nearby woods.Later that evening, Elliot hears some noise outside in the backyard, and goes outside. He encounters a strange creature that scares the both of them. The creature quickly leaves the backyard and through a nearby gate that leads into the woods.The next day, Elliot goes out on his bike to the forest, taking a bag of Reese Pieces with him, hoping to find the creature he saw. He soon sees the man with the keys on his belt loop, and quickly leaves the forested area.That evening, Elliot gets into an argument with his family, when it seems that no one will believe him. Elliot claims that his Dad would believe him. As their Mother has just been through a messy divorce, this causes her feelings to be hurt, with Michael angrily chastising his brother for being cruel.Later that evening, Elliot stays outside, where this time, the creature comes right up to him, and returns some of the Reeses Pieces that were in the forest. Elliot then lures the creature into the house and up to his room. When he finally sees the creature in full, it is a strange brown-colored being that is like nothing he's ever seen before. The creature has a gentle nature and seems as curious about Elliott as the boy is about it.Elliot fakes having a fever the next day to stay home from school. During the day, he acclimates himself to the creature, and tells him his name, as well as shows him different things around the house. Later that evening, Elliot shows the creature to Michael and their younger sister Gertie, who both promise not to tell anyone about him.They soon surmise that this thing must in some way be an alien, and get him to try and explain where he's from. Instead, the creature displays its powers, which cause several spheres to levitate and rotate like the planets in the solar system. Gertie also gives the alien a potted plant with dying flowers, which the alien revives, bringing them into full bloom.Elliot has the creature hide in his closet the next day, as everyone heads off to school. While everyone is away, the alien gets out and into the fridge, raiding the food and drinking several beers, before watching TV. Unknown to Elliot, the alien has formed a mental bond with him, and these feelings carry on over to his science class, where Elliot finds himself setting loose a number of frogs for a dissection project and causing chaos. Elliott also feels a surge of emotion that prompts him to kiss a blonde girl in his class.After Elliot returns home that evening, he finds that Gertie has helped teach the alien to talk, and Elliot then decides to name the alien E.T. E.T. then attempts to explain that he intends to build a machine to communicate with his home planet, so they can come to get him.Later that evening, Elliot and Michael go through the garage looking for items to use. Michael notes that E.T. doesn't look so good, to which Elliot explains that ""they are fine."" Unknown to the two of them, a van monitoring outside has picked up their conversation.On Halloween, Elliot and Michael dress E.T. up in a sheet, passing him off to their mother as Gertie dressed up as a ghost. Gertie has already left with Elliot's bicycle, and gone to a specific point above the suburban area. Once the three meet her there, Gertie trades places with E.T., as both Elliot and E.T. head off to assemble and activate the communications machine he has assembled. As they travel through the forest, with E.T. perched in a basket on the handlebars, Elliott's bike suddenly starts racing down a steep hill toward a cliff. Elliott panics, thinking they'll die, but the bike flies safely over the precipice, the little alien having used an unknown ability to make the bike take off and land safely. E.T assembles and activates his crude machine and it begins to send a signal out into space. Elliott is exhausted and falls asleep, with the alien watching over him.Elliot wakes up the next day in the woods, with no sign of E.T. He returns home where his Mother has been afraid something had happened to him. Elliot pleads with Michael to find E.T. Michael first goes to the forest, but eventually finds E.T., pale pink in color and barely breathing near a storm drain.Getting him home, Michael and the others show E.T. to their mother. E.T. has taken on a pasty white look, and is shallowly breathing. Elliot explains that both he and E.T. are sick and perhaps dying. Their mother panics and demands they leave E.T. and get out of the house immediately, but they are soon set upon by persons in space suits, and then government men who quickly seal off the house and set up a medical unit to examine and help Elliot and E.T.It is here that the man with the keys on his belt loop (who we will call ""Keys"") returns to the picture. Keys explains to Elliot that they have found the machine in the forest, and wants to know how to save E.T. Keys tells Elliott that he's had the same kind of childlike wonder about alien beings and that finding E.T. is a lifelong dream come true. Elliot weakly explains that E.T. needs to go home, but as they talk, E.T. soon detaches himself from Elliot, and finally succumbs to the illness, leaving Elliott to recover. Michael realizes this when the plants E.T. had revived begin to wilt and die.The medical team attempts to revive E.T., but he eventually dies. Before they take E.T. away, Keys allows Elliot some time alone with E.T.. Elliot then explains that E.T. must be dead, because he can't feel anything anymore. Elliot then tells E.T. that he loves him, and turns away. As he does so, he sees the flowers that were dying before are returning to life. Elliot goes back to the container where E.T. is, and finds him alive, and explains that his planet's people will be returning to get him. Elliot manages to hide the fact that E.T. is alive, and then hatches a plan with Michael to get him to the forest.Michael has his friends take Elliot's bike and theirs to a playground at the top of a nearby hill. Meanwhile, Michael and Elliot steal the van with E.T.'s container, and make their way to the playground. Meeting Michael's friends there, they then take E.T. and head for the forest. The government agents then give chase. As they race away, they see a roadblock ahead, armed agents waiting around the cars. Just as it seems they'll all be captured, E.T. levitates all the kids' bikes and they fly off toward the woods.As they land, and night settles, E.T.'s ship lands. Elliot's mother and Gertie show up shortly afterward, and Gertie and Michael say their goodbyes, before it's Elliot's turn. E.T. asks Elliot to come with him, but Elliot says he has to stay. E.T. gives his new friend a hug, and then lights his finger and points it at Elliot's head, telling Elliot that he'll ""be right here.""Gertie gives E.T. the plant she initially gave him, and he goes into the enormous ship, which soon lifts off leaving a rainbow behind, as everyone stares off into the sky."
Tootsie,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Michael Dorsey, an unsuccessful actor, disguises himself as a woman in order to get a role on a trashy hospital soap. Michael Dorsey is an unemployed actor with an impossible reputation. In order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/'lover,' a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection.—Bryan Kuniyoshi New York actor Michael Dorsey is a talented perfectionist who is so hard on himself and others that his agent can no longer find work for him. After a soap opera audition goes poorly, Michael reinvents himself as actress Dorothy Michaels and wins the part. What was supposed to be a short-lived role turns into a long-term contract, but when Michael falls for his castmate Julie, complications develop that could wreck everything.—Jwelch5742 Michael Dorsey is desperate; he can't find a job. That is, until he gets a female role in a soap opera and becomes very famous. Of course, nobody knows that this new television star is a man... But, after a while, he falls in love with the leading actress of the series, and here is the big problem: how can he express his feelings, since she thinks that Michael is a woman?—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Michael Dorsey is renowned in the entertainment field for being a good but difficult and temperamental actor. He is informed by his agent, George Fields, that no one will hire him because of his bad reputation. In his personal life, Michael is a bit of a cad who treats women poorly, especially his long term friend and fellow actor Sandy Lester, a doormat of a woman who already has self-esteem issues. Both to prove George wrong and to raise money to finance a play written by his roommate Jeff Slater so that he and Sandy can star in it, Michael, incognito as female Dorothy Michaels, auditions for a role in Southwest General, a daytime serial. The role is of Emily Kimberley, the tough, no-nonsense administrator of the hospital. As Dorothy, Michael injects into his audition his own sensibilities, which lands him the short term role. As Michael progresses in the role, only George and Jeff know Dorothy's true identity. As Dorothy, Michael continues to play the role as he himself would, often ad libbing. He detests his director, Ron Carlisle, for the way he treats him and women in general (much the way Michael treated women himself), including Ron's girlfriend, lead Southwest General actress Julie Nichols. Dorothy treats Julie with care and respect, and begins to fall in love with her. However, two men fall for Dorothy, namely Southwest General's long time Lothario lead actor John Van Horn, and Julie's father Les. Michael has to find a way to let Julie know his feelings as a man without ruining their friendship. Worse problems arise for Michael when Dorothy's no-exit clause contract on Southwest General is extended, meaning Michael may have to pretend to be Dorothy for much longer than he was originally intending.—Huggo Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is an actor living and working in New York City. Most of his work seems to be on the stage; he is adept at disguises, and has a tendency to tailor his own look at the audition based on what he thinks the director wants. However, he is also very stubborn and willful; for instance, he has one confrontation with a director over whether his character can get up and move center stage for a death scene. Michael storms off the stage and quits the play, even though apparently they are well into rehearsals.Michael lives with his best friend Jeff Slater (Bill Murray), an eccentric playwright, and both men earn a living by waiting tables in a restaurant. As the film opens, Jeff and Michael's many friends and associates throw him a surprise birthday party, during which Michael's inability to connect with women becomes obvious. He has the tendency to lie, even about trivial things, to the point where the women see through him and avoid him. When Michael's potential love connection leaves the party with another man, Michael decides to console his neurotic friend Sandy Lester (Teri Garr) by walking her home. Sandy is nervous about an audition that she has the following day for a TV soap opera called ""Southwest General"", Michael coaches her and agrees to walk her to the audition the next day.When they get to the studio, the director refuses to even allow Sandy to read; he says she isn't intimidating enough. When Michael tries to talk to a secretary to get hold of a friend of his in the cast, he finds out his friend has left the cast to do a Broadway play--a role that Michael's agent, George Fields (director Sydney Pollack), had promised for Michael himself. Michael becomes furious and goes straight to George's office and barges in. George humors him at first but then explains to Michael that his reputation as a troublemaker has made him impossible to employ. Even directors who have hired Michael for TV commercials have found themselves over-budget due to Michael's inability to take direction. Michael questions George about Jeff's play that he's writing; Michael has sent George a copy of it, and George dismisses it as a pointless play that nobody will see. Michael becomes resolved; he will raise the $8,000 it will take to produce Jeff's play. George disagrees and tells Michael nobody will hire him.The next thing we see is Michael, walking down a busy New York street... in disguise as a woman. He goes to the audition for ""Southwest General"" and gives them the bogus name ""Dorothy Michaels"", name dropping George as ""her"" agent. Dorothy meets the show's producer, Rita Marshall (Doris Beack), who takes her in to meet Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman), the show's director. Ron sees Dorothy and immediately dismisses her, just as he must have done to Sandy. He tells Dorothy she's not right for the part, but Dorothy presses the issue and asks why. When Ron tells her she's not intimidating enough, Dorothy questions his intentions and becomes visibly angry and loud, scolding Ron and even Rita about wanting to portray powerful women in a negative, unattractive light. Rita seems to take what Dorothy said to heart, and follows her when she storms out, asking her to come back in for a reading. Ron is put off by Dorothy's outburst, but Rita smooths it over by flattering him, telling him Dorothy was impressed with the way he communicated the part to her. Dorothy's audition is impressive, and although Ron says there is something about her that doesn't sit right with him, Rita decides to hire her for the role.Still dressed as Dorothy, Michael goes to the Russian Tea Room, where he knows George will be having lunch, and intercepts him, inviting himself to George's table and discreetly revealing to George that he is Michael Dorsey in disguise. George is horrified, and even more shocked that Michael managed to land a job as Dorothy. When a couple of New York producers approach George in passing, Michael pinches George under the table to emphasize how well he fits the role. After they leave, Michael borrows $1,000 from George and goes shopping for a new wardrobe.Back home, Michael has a discussion with Jeff about his strange new gig as Dorothy. He plans on simply doing the soap opera for the next few weeks until he raises the money to do Jeff's play, which is intended as a vehicle for Michael and Sandy. Michael and Jeff both wonder how they'll tell Sandy that they have obtained the money to do the play, without telling her that the producers hired a man in drag instead of her. Michael decides to lie to her, telling her a family member died. Michael and Sandy decide to celebrate by going out to dinner; while Sandy is in the shower, Michael spots a dress she owns and wants to try it on, but after he undresses, Sandy returns unexpectedly. At a loss to explain why he is in his underwear, Michael tells her he wants her and has sex with her. Afterward, they both wonder how it will change their friendship; Sandy is pessimistic and says Michael will never call her now, but Michael promises to have dinner with her the following day.At his first day on the job as Dorothy, Michael meets his fellow cast members, including a beautiful woman named Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange). She plays a nurse on the show, and she also happens to be Ron's girlfriend. Dorothy makes a good impression on everybody, but Michael is shocked when he discovers that Dorothy has a scene where she kisses a lecherous male cast member, Dr Brewster, played by an older man named John Van Horn (George Gaynes). Since Michael does not relish the idea of kissing another man, ""Dorothy"" ends up changing the scene, hitting John over the head with a folder when he tries to kiss her. Although Ron is incensed, he lets it pass, and the emergence of both Dorothy and the character she is playing as a strong, no-nonsense woman begins.Dorothy and Julie also begin a friendship. Although Julie sees Dorothy as simply another woman, Dorothy is really Michael, and he is extremely attracted to Julie. A series of mishaps occurs where Michael breaks plans with Sandy in order to spend time with Julie, culminating in an evening when he goes to Julie's apartment as Dorothy in order to discuss work and socialize with her. Dorothy meets Julie's infant daughter, Amy, and discovers that Julie has a fondness for drinking. She seems vaguely unhappy and in search of her own voice, something that keeps her under the spell of Ron.On the set, Dorothy sees Ron treating Julie with disrespect, not only cheating on her with other women but constantly talking down to her, clearly not taking her seriously as a person. When Julie mentions that Ron was supposed to show up for dinner one night and stood her up, Michael suddenly remembers Sandy and the dinner she had planned to make at her apartment for the both of them that night. After leaving Julie's, Michael goes home, changes out of his disguise, and goes over to Sandy's. She isn't nearly as furious with him as she should be, and even Michael points this out to her. Sandy accuses him of having an affair, having spotted Dorothy going into Michael's apartment. Michael tells her ""Sandy, I'm not having an affair with the woman that went into my apartment. It's impossible.""As Dorothy, Michael begins to learn about what it means to be a woman, particularly the roles that men may expect women to play. When Ron talks down to Dorothy, she stands up for herself and gives it back to him, which inspires Julie and the other women on the show. Additionally, Dorothy's spunky attitude is a hit with the viewers of ""Southwest General"", causing the show's ratings to climb and Dorothy to become a minor celebrity.Meanwhile, George remains an unwilling accomplice in Michael's deception, perhaps mostly due to the fact that Michael already associated him with Dorothy by telling everyone he's her agent. He takes Michael to a party one night and they see Julie there with Ron. Michael isn't in disguise, so neither one of them recognizes him as Dorothy. Michael makes an attempt to talk to Julie, but she ignores him, eventually throwing a drink in his face when he makes an off-color remark to her. The failed conversation adds to Michael's panic about his relationship with Julie; as Dorothy, he is Julie's friend and confidante. As Michael, he doesn't stand a chance with her.As Dorothy's tenure with ""Southwest General"" is about to end, Julie invites her to come with her to upstate New York, where her widowed father still lives on the farm where Julie grew up. Against Jeff's advice, Michael goes with Julie, maintaining his Dorothy disguise all weekend. Dorothy meets Julie's father, Les (Charles Durning), a conservative but kind man who enjoys the laid back life he leads on the farm. Julie tells Dorothy that Les hasn't dated any women since her mother passed away, and it becomes clear that he takes a strong liking to Dorothy. Dorothy manages to politely avoid all of Les's advances.When they return to New York, the precarious position that Michael is in begins to implode. Rita tells Dorothy that because of her popularity with the viewers, they will be picking up their option to keep her on the show for another season. Michael then phones George to update him with the news. Michael is very upset since he wants to leave the show in order to do Jeff's play, but George tells him there is nothing he can do about it because the studio has the legal option to keep Dorothy on. As Michael is about to go to bed, he gets a frantic call from Julie asking Dorothy if she can come over and sit for Amy while Julie goes out with Ron; Julie has decided to break up with Ron, and she tells Dorothy that she herself is the inspiration for Julie's newfound assertiveness. After a few harrowing hours where Amy refuses to cooperate with Dorothy, Julie returns, despondent about the breakup, and in a moment of vulnerability, she tells Dorothy that she treasures their friendship more than anything, but feels like she wants something she just can't have. In response, Michael leans in and tries to kiss Julie, but Julie of course does not know Dorothy is really a man, and she assumes Dorothy is a lesbian who just made a pass at her. Confused and upset, she is clearly distraught that her new best friend has made a pass at her, when the phone rings. It is Les, and he asks if he can speak to Dorothy, inviting her to a downtown club for drinks and dancing. What Les really intends is to propose marriage to Dorothy, giving her an engagement ring. Dorothy tells him she needs time to think it over and leaves.Michael returns home by taxi and finds John Van Horn waiting outside his apartment building for Dorothy. When she refuses to invite him up, he starts serenading her loudly and attracts the attention of neighbors, so Dorothy invites him up. After making several attempts to seduce Dorothy, John is horrified when Jeff returns home unexpectedly. Embarrassed, he leaves. Jeff turns to Michael and says ""You slut!"" The final strand to unravel is Sandy, who shows up right after, banging on the front door to be let in. Michael hurriedly takes a shower, removing his makeup and Dorothy disguise. Sandy demands to know why he hasn't been returning her phone calls. Michael attempts to lie to her again, giving her a box of chocolates that Les sent Dorothy, but her forgets there is a note attached. Sandy reads it and it says ""Thank you for a wonderful night in front of the fire, Les."" Cornered, Michael decides to finally come clean with Sandy, but all he manages to get out is ""I'm in love with another woman"" before Sandy plunges into hysteria. Even so, Sandy tells Michael that she could handle the fact that he was in love with another woman, but she does not like being lied to. Michael has already come to the realization that he has been behaving like Ron, rationalizing his lies and callous treatment of women, which may explain why Michael does not have any real relationship with a woman at all.Things come to a head when, the next day at the studio, one of the reels of the show is accidentally destroyed and the cast is forced to do a crucial scene live on the air. Before they go on, Dorothy visits Julie's dressing room. Julie tells Dorothy that she cannot see her anymore. Since Julie now thinks another woman is in love with her, she can't lead Dorothy on by pretending to be friends when she knows Dorothy wants more from her. When they go on the air, Ron and Rita watch nervously, hoping that the scene comes off alright. They are horrified when Dorothy starts veering wildly from the script, taking her character into a long speech about why she came to Southwest General. After concocting a crazy story about disfiguring diseases, exile in foreign countries, and other nonsense, Dorothy takes off her wig and reveals herself to be a man underneath, weaving her own real story into that of her character, as if her unmasking was always intended to be part of the Southwest General plot all along. Sandy and Les react in horror, watching the episode from their TV sets, while the cast themselves are shocked to discover that Dorothy is actually a man. Julie walks up to Michael and angrily hits him in the stomach.Some time after the fallout, a now unemployed Michael drives upstate and finds Les in the bar where he likes to hang out, presumably to return the ring and make amends. Les is hostile at first, but eventually softens enough to allow Michael to apologize. Michael explains why he took the role as Dorothy, because he needed the money, and that he never meant to hurt anybody. Les and Michael eventually lighten up enough to joke about the situation, and Les admits that Michael was good company. Michael tells Les that he is in love with Julie, but Les says Julie never mentions him.The final scene occurs when Michael attempts to see Julie. He waits for her outside the TV studio, but Julie spots him and walks away. Michael chases after her and tries to make small talk with her. Julie tries to avoid him but finally allows him to talk to her. Michael tells Julie what he told Les, that he only did it for the money, and that he couldn't help falling in love with Julie. He also says that he was a better person as Dorothy than he ever was as himself. He asks her to give him a chance, since they were already good friends. Julie admits that she misses Dorothy, but Michael reminds her that he is Dorothy. ""I just gotta learn to do it without the dress,"" he tells her. Julie softens and smiles, playfully asking him if she can borrow one of Dorothy's outfits. In the final shot, they walk down the street together talking and laughing, and after they get about a block away, Julie happily puts her arm around Michael."
An Officer and a Gentleman,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084434/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man must complete his work at a Navy Officer Candidate School to become an aviator, with the help of a tough Gunnery Sergeant and his new girlfriend. Zack Mayo is a young man who has signed up for Navy Aviation Officer Candidate School. He is a Navy brat who has a bad attitude problem. Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley is there to train and evaluate him, and will clearly find Zack wanting. Zack meets Paula, a girl who has little beyond family, and must decide what it is he wants to do with his life.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Zack Mayo grew up without much parental guidance following his mother's suicide when he was an adolescent. His naval seaman father, who was stationed in The Philippines at the time, became his official guardian, a role to which he admitted he did not want. As such, Zack grew up to be a loner and without a true sense of home or adult responsibility. Regardless, he, as a young man, decides to enlist in the navy to become a jet fighting officer, with the initial thirteen week training to take place at the air naval station on Whidbey Island, Washington. He plans on taking as easy a route possible through training, even if it means bending the rules and cutting corners. The drill instructor, Sergeant Emil Foley, seems to relish humiliating the recruits - especially Zack - with the ultimate goal of making them ""DOR"" aka drop on request. Despite being warned against who are known as the ""Puget Debs"" i.e. local girls who try to trap the officer candidates so that they can escape their drab factory lives, Zack and his best friend among the other officer candidates, Sid Worley, take up with two possible Puget Debs, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy respectively. Zack's experiences with Sgt. Foley are an obstacle to him making it through the thirteen weeks without DORing, but also make him come to an admission of why he wants to become an officer. And his experiences with Paula, Sid and Lynette provide him with some grounding as to what it means to be a grown up, despite Paula and Lynette's outward goal of becoming officer's wives by whatever means required.—Huggo Zack Mayo, a new member of the U.S. Navy, has a bad attitude. When he signs up for the Aviation Academy, he is met with the strict leadership of Sgt. Emil Foley, who gives Zack a rude awakening in terms of relating with other people. Through Foley's guidance -- and an unexpected romance with Paula, an outsider who hangs around the naval base -- Zack learns some tough lessons and discovers what he truly wants out of life.—Jwelch5742 Zack Mayo is a loner who has never had to rely on anyone but himself. As a child, he was sent to live with his father, a career Navy man based in the Philippines, after his mother commits suicide. There he soon realized that he had to be tough and rely on no one. After graduating from college, he shocks his father by telling that he has enlisted in the Navy and will enter training as a naval aviator. There he brings the same loner attitude he has had all of his life. He does however meet Paula, an attractive young woman who often attends base functions in the hope of nabbing a young officer and Sid Worley, a classmate with whom he forms a close bond. The training is difficult but not as tough as having to deal with their training officer, Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley who teaches Zack a lesson in the importance of relying on your friends and colleagues.—garykmcd Zachary ""Zack"" Mayo (Richard Gere) has been living in the Philippines with his womanizing father Byron (Robert Loggia), an alcoholic U.S. Navy chief boatswain's mate, since early adolescence, after Zack's mother committed suicide when Zack was around 10-years-old. Hoping to put his life on a different path, Zack signs up for the Navy's Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) to become a Navy pilot. In the opening scene, Zack tells Byron about his intentions. But Byron doesn't offer much support or compassion. He tells Zack that U.S. Navy volunteers must serve six years before becoming a Navy jet pilot. After saying goodbye to his father, Zack packs up and leaves his father's decrepit Seattle apartment and rides away on his motorcycle to his destination.Opon arrival at the U.S. Navy Cadet Training Camp located outside Tacoma, Washington state, Zack and his fellow AOCs are ""welcomed"" by their strict head drill instructor, Marine Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.). Foley makes it clear that the program is designed to eliminate any officer candidates who are not suitable to earn their ""prize""; a commission as an ensign in the U.S. Navy and flight training worth over $1,000,000 a year in salary. Foley further warns the male candidates about the young women in the area, who Foley says scout the regiment for officers that they want to marry and will go so far as to feign pregnancy or actually become pregnant in order to trap them. Zack hits it off with two fellow outgoing candidates, Sid Worley (David Keith) and female candidate Casey Seeger (Lisa Eilbacher).A few days later, Zack and Sid meet two local girls - factory workers - at a Navy-hosted dance. Zack begins a romantic relationship with Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger) and Sid with Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount).Meanwhile, Foley rides Zack mercilessly, believing that he lacks motivation and is not a team player. When Zack's side business of selling pre-shined shoes and belt buckles is discovered, Foley hazes him for an entire weekend in an attempt to make him DOR (""Drop on Request"", AOCS term for requesting termination of one's training), but Zack refuses to give in. Foley then tells Zack that he will simply have him thrown out; Zack finally breaks down, telling Foley that he has nowhere else to go and has nothing else in his life. Satisfied that Zack has come to a crucial self-realization, Foley lets up on him.While Zack and Paula spend the next weekend together, she takes him home to meet and have dinner with her family. After dinner, she shows Zack an old picture of her real father. He was also an AOC who, following his commissioning, left for flight training and simply deserted her mother, refusing to marry her when she became pregnant with Paula. Zack lies about his life by telling Paula that his father is dead.Later, Zack has a chance to break the record time for negotiating the obstacle course; meanwhile, Seeger will be disqualified if she can't negotiate the 12 foot high wall at the end, which she lacks the upper-body strength to climb easily. Zack abandons his attempt to break the course record in order to coach Seeger over the wall, and she makes it.Following dinner with Sid and his parents in town, Zack learns that Sid has a long-time girlfriend back home, whom he plans to marry after being commissioned.

He's found by Zack and Paula.Depressed about his friend's death, Zack decides to DOR himself but Foley won't let him go so close to graduation. He and Zack clash in an unofficial martial arts bout with the platoon looking on. Although Zack dominates for most of the fight (mostly fueled by his anger at Foley, who he believed played a part in Sid's suicide by not stopping him from leaving), Foley manages to win by kicking Zack in the groin. Foley tells him he can quit if he wants to.Zack does show up for graduation, and is sworn into the Navy with his class. Following naval tradition, he seeks out and receives his first salute from Foley in exchange for a US silver dollar. While tradition calls for the drill instructor to place the coin in his left shirt pocket, Foley places the coin in his right pocket and gives Zack a picture-perfect salute, acknowledging that Zack was a special candidate. Zack tells him he will never forget him and that he never would have made it through without his guidance. Zack then leaves the Navy school on the same motorcycle he arrived on.In the final scene, Zack, now Ensign Mayo with orders to flight training, seeks out Paula at the factory where she works. He picks her up and walks out with her in his arms to the applause and cheers of her co-workers, including Lynette."
Rocky III,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084602/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rocky faces the ultimate challenge from a powerful new contender, and must turn to a former rival to help regain his throne as the undisputed fighting champion. Sylvester Stallone returns to the character which made him famous in this wildly successful sequel. Rocky III starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith), before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression, Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive ""eye of the tiger,"" the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) teaches him during this film's training sequence. In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. Three years and 10 successful title defenses after beating Apollo Creed, with whom he has become great friends, a now wealthy Rocky Balboa is considering retirement. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to Clubber Lang, who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's trainer Mickey. Rocky sinks into a depression, and Apollo decides to train Rocky for a rematch against Lang so Rocky can try to win the title back.—Todd Baldridge 'Rocky III' begins with the ending of the 15th round of the rematch between Rocky and Apollo Creed in Rocky II, with Rocky Balboa becoming the new heavyweight champion of the world. This is followed by an opening montage of scenes that explain what happened in the time between Rocky II and Rocky III: in the five years since winning the heavyweight title from Apollo (1976-1981), Rocky has a string of 10 successful title defenses. As his winning streak grows, so does his fame, wealth and celebrity, and soon Rocky is seen everywhere, from magazine covers to TV show guest star appearances. Rocky is also heavily merchandised, sponsoring varied products and services. At the same time, a ferocious new boxer named James ""Clubber"" Lang (Mr. T) is climbing the ranks, rapidly becoming the number one contender for Rocky's title.Rocky's brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) has grown jealous of Rocky's accomplishments. After a night of heavy drinking, Paulie stumbles into a video arcade, hurls an empty whiskey bottle through a ROCKY pinball machine in a rage and is arrested. Rocky bails him out of jail and, on the way to Rocky's car to ride home, Paulie begins berating Rocky for forgetting him on his climb to the top. Paulie swallows his pride and asks Rocky for a job, which Rocky grants him.Rocky agrees to a charity match with wrestling champion Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). While Rocky treats the match as a lighthearted exhibition, Thunderlips seems to be taking it seriously with a ferocious attack, body-slamming Rocky, using several of Hogan's signature moves and eventually throwing him out of the ring. Chaos erupts when the seemingly enraged Thunderlips punches Paulie and throws the officials around and his ring girls attack them as well. In Rocky's corner, Mickey, a pained look on his face, seems to be suffering a mild heart attack. Rocky shouts to Paulie (his new ringman) to cut his gloves off. The gloves come off and Rocky returns to the ring, taunting the wrestler. Rocky fights back, hitting the wrestler with several body punches, choking him in a headlock until the giant falls to one knee, and manages to throw Thunderlips out of the ring himself. Just as the match is about to degenerate into a type of shoot fight with the enraged Thunderlips pounding back into the ring, the bell rings and the match is declared a draw. Thunderlips calms down, and it's clear that his aggression earlier was just for show. Rocky asks: ""Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?"" Thunderlips: ""That's the name of the game."" A now-smiling Thunderlips agrees to have his picture taken with Rocky's wife and son, with an aching Rock stating ""Sometimes charity really hurts!"" The photo is printed in the paper, along with the amount of money they raised.In gratitude for his charity work, the City of Philadelphia reveals a large bronze statue of Rocky at the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. At the event, Rock announces his plans to retire from boxing. The crowd of Rocky fans disapprove of his decision. Clubber Lang, who is in attendance at the ceremony, steps forward and publicly challenges Rocky, this time criticizing Rocky's title defenses as being intentional set-ups against weak, over-matched ""bums."" Lang, ranked number one among contenders for the title, also berates the politics of boxing, the reason Lang feels he's been denied a title shot. Furthermore, he harasses Adrian. Angered by a sexually suggestive remark Lang makes towards Adrian, Rocky agrees to the fight, but Mickey wants no part of it. Returning home, Rocky argues with Mickey. Mickey admits to Rocky that the fighters he defended his title against were good fighters but ""hand-picked"", only because Rocky received such a bad beating in his win over Creed that Mickey took it upon himself to make sure Rocky remained successful and healthy. He also tells Rocky that Lang is a young, hungry ""wrecking machine"", having attended several of Lang's bouts, and that Rocky has no chance of beating him, as he hasn't retained his edge as a fighter. Rocky manages to convince Mickey to train him regardless, saying he'll give it one more shot before he and Rock retire.Rock's training program is an irresponsible, Las Vegas-style camp filled with distractions -- fans are allowed to watch him train and Rock allows women to kiss him for pictures, upsetting Adrian. Paulie wanders around selling loads of Rocky-based merchandise. Rocky clearly does not take the challenge seriously (similar to Creed in the first Rocky movie). Clubber's relentless and painful training regimen of working out by himself in a derelict building with whatever objects he has and running through city alleys clearly shows that he is taking his preparation for the bout far more seriously.Lang and Rocky meet at Philadelphia's Spectrum. During a melee before the fight -- where both fighters are mistakenly brought out of their dressing rooms at the same time -- Mickey is shoved out of the way by Lang and suffers a heart attack. A now distraught Rocky wants to call the fight off, but Mickey angrily urges him on while he stays in the dressing room. By the time of the fight, Rocky is both enraged and severely distracted by his mentor's condition. At ringside, Rocky's old nemesis Apollo Creed is on hand to do commentary. While shaking hands with both fighters, Creed is insulted and rebuffed by Lang as a has-been and encourages Rocky to win. The fight begins: Rocky starts by pounding Lang with several huge blows, going for an early knockout, but the stronger and better-prepared Lang is unfazed and quickly takes charge, viciously dominating Rocky and knocking him out in the second round. Beaten, Rocky makes his way back to the dressing room and to the dying Mickey. Kneeling at his side, Rocky speaks to his friend, telling him that the fight ended in the second by a knockout, which Mickey misinterprets as a win for Rocky as he passes away. Following the funeral, Rocky faces depression mixed with anger and hopelessness. His self-confidence and self-respect are gone in the wake of the loss and the loss of Mickey. At one point he rides his motorcycle to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the statue of himself. Angered that he can't match the glory it represents, he furiously throws his helmet at it and rides off.Stopping by Mickey's closed gym, Rocky is confronted by Apollo Creed, who offers to help train him. Apollo makes a pitch to snap Rocky out of his funk and get him back on the winning track. Apollo slowly convinces his old adversary that he can regain the fire Rocky thrived on in his earlier days, and tells him he must regain the ""eye of the tiger"", his fighting spirit, mainly by starting from scratch. Rocky says he's curious.Watching film footage of Rocky's loss, Apollo determines that Rock will have to put Lang down early since Rocky can't go an entire 15 rounds. Rock and Apollo watch a sports commentator interviewing Lang, who scoffs at the idea of rematch with Rocky, saying he welcomes the opportunity to beat up on Rock more. When the commentator reveals that Apollo is training Rocky, Lang becomes even more indignant and arrogant. The commentator says that, at his age, the odds are heavily stacked against Rocky. Paulie tells Rock not to listen but Apollo says Rock should listen and that everyone will owe him a huge apology when he wins. He also tells Rock that when the fight is over, Rock owes him a favor.Creed takes Rock to Los Angeles to train at his old gym where they meet up with Creed's old manager, Tony ""Duke"" Evers, who has enthusiastically agreed to assist Creed in training Rocky. At first, Rocky is too demoralized to put forth his best efforts, which repeatedly frustrates Apollo, who has Rock learn how to fight by learning a new method of dancing to funk music, running and swimming. One day on a beach, Apollo tries to get Rock to run faster than him and Rock fails. Apollo thinks there's no chance for a comeback and stalks off. Adrian approaches Rock and tries to talk to him. After admitting to Adrian that he's afraid, that his previous post-Apollo fights were set-ups and that he feels responsible for Mickey's death, she tells Rocky he has no right to feel guilty over Mickey, who was a grown man and made his own choices. She also tells him to fight for himself and no one else. Rocky is inspired enough to pull himself together to train as hard as he can, adding some of Apollo's speed and skill to his own style of fighting. During his training, Rocky forges a deep bond with both Duke and (especially) Apollo, their relationship evolving from former adversaries to close friends. In a final training scene, Rock beats Apollo in another foot race and the two joyously celebrate at the return of Rocky's edge and his spirit.The rematch is held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In Rock's dressing room, Apollo presents him with the same American flag trunks he wore for in their previous matches. He also reminds Rocky that he owes him a favor. A bewildered Rock asks him what it is but Apollo refuses to tell him.When both fighters meet in the ring, Rocky clearly has regained the hungry look of his early career and he is able to face Lang with new confidence, his piercing gaze never leaving Lang's. Rock is also some 10 pounds lighter and clearly faster than he used to be. At the start of the fight, Rocky sprints from his corner, fighting with a level of skill and spirit that no one, including Lang, expected. As a result Rocky completely dominates the first round, demonstrating his new-found speed. After the bell, Clubber, who is in a fit of rage over the unexpected pounding he's taken has to be restrained by his trainers. In the second round, Lang gains the upper hand, and Rocky adopts an entirely different strategy that bewilders Apollo; he intentionally takes a beating from Lang, (he gets knocked down at one point but manages to get up before he's counted out) whilst taunting him for being unable to knock him out.In Round 3, Lang, who is used to winning fights swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds, becomes increasingly angry and quickly exhausts his energy trying to finish Rocky off with repeated knockout blows, most of which miss the newly-agile Rocky entirely. Rocky taunts Lang in order to psyche him out, with taunts such as, ""My mother can hit harder than that'"", and, ""You ain't so bad, you ain't so bad, you ain't nothing"". The quick-tempered Clubber is infuriated. He attacks even harder, walking right into Balboa's trap. The tide turns, and Rocky is able to overpower the winded and outfoxed Lang, landing blow after blow and dodging Lang's attempted punches before knocking him out. Rocky is declared the winner and his title as Heavyweight Champion is restored.Soon afterward, Rocky and Apollo return to Mickey's gym, with Apollo revealing the price of his training: a third fight with Rocky. However, this time it would only be a private sparring match between two new friends, which Rocky accepts. The film ends with Rocky and Apollo in the ring both throwing punches at each other as the screen freezes and song 'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor plays."
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"With the assistance of the Enterprise crew, Admiral Kirk must stop an old nemesis, Khan Noonien Singh, from using the life-generating Genesis Device as the ultimate weapon. It is the 23rd century. Admiral James T. Kirk is an instructor at Starfleet Academy and feeling old; the prospect of attending his ship, the USS Enterprise--now a training ship--on a two-week cadet cruise does not make him feel any younger. But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when his nemesis Khan Noonien Singh--infamous conqueror from late 20th century Earth--appears after years of exile. Khan later revealed that the planet Ceti Alpha VI exploded, and shifted the orbit of the fifth planet as a Mars-like haven. He begins capturing Project Genesis, a top secret device holding the power of creation itself, and schemes the utter destruction of Kirk.—Gregory A. Sheets <m-sheets2@onu.edu> It is the 23rd century. The Federation starship USS Enterprise is on routine training maneuvers, and Admiral James T. Kirk seems resigned to the fact that this may well be the last space mission of his career. But Khan Noonien Singh is back. Aided by his exiled band of genetic supermen, Khan--infamous conqueror from late 20th century Earth--has raided Space Station Regula One, stolen a top secret device called Project Genesis, wrested control of another Federation starship, and now schemes to set a most deadly trap for his old enemy Kirk... with the threat of a universal Armageddon!—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> In the year 2285, Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) oversees a simulator session of Captain Spock's (Leonard Nimoy) trainees. In the simulation, Lieutenant Saavik commands the star ship USS Enterprise on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru. When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers. Later, Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) joins Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command and not grow old behind a desk.Meanwhile, the USS Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet for testing of the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize matter to create habitable worlds for colonization. Reliant officers Commander Pavel Chekov and Captain Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a possible candidate planet, which they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI; once there, they are captured by genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán). The Enterprise discovered Khan's ship adrift in space 15 years previously; Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen from 20th-century Earth to Ceti Alpha V after they attempted to take over the Enterprise. After they were marooned, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and destroying its ecosystem. Khan blames Kirk for the death of his wife and plans revenge. He implants Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Terrell (Paul Winfield) with indigenous creatures that enter the ears of their victims and render them susceptible to mind control and uses the officers to capture the Reliant. Learning of Genesis, Khan attacks space station Regula I where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David.The Enterprise embarks on a three-week training voyage. Kirk assumes command after the ship receives a distress call from Regula I. En route, the Enterprise is ambushed and crippled by the Reliant, leading to the deaths and injuries of many trainees. Khan hails the Enterprise and offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis. Kirk stalls for time and uses the Reliant's prefix code to remotely lower its shields, allowing the Enterprise to counterattack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while the Enterprise limps to Regula I.Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive (who feign innocence and say that they did not help Khan. They also tell Kirk that Khan tortured the station crew but could not get hold of Genesis as Dr Marcus and David were nowhere to be found. The data banks were empty as well), along with slaughtered members of Marcus's team. They soon find Carol and David hiding deep inside the Planetoid of Regula. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body.
Khan then transports Genesis aboard the Reliant. Though Khan believes his foe stranded on Regula I, Kirk and Spock use a coded message to arrange a rendezvous. Kirk directs the Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula; static discharges inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making the Enterprise and the Reliant evenly matched. Spock notes however that Khan's tactics are two-dimensional, indicating inexperience in space combat, which Kirk then exploits to critically disable the Reliant.Mortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, which will reorganize all matter in the nebula, including the Enterprise. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation of Genesis and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time due to the ship's damaged warp drive. Spock goes to the engine room to restore the warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, as exposure to the high levels of radiation would be fatal, Spock incapacitates the doctor with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld, telling him to ""remember"". Spock successfully restores power to the warp drive and the Enterprise escapes the explosion, though at the cost of his life. The explosion of Genesis causes the gas in the nebula to reform into a new planet, capable of sustaining life.After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk arrives in the engine room and discovers Spock dying of radiation poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise's torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves to pick up the Reliant's marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. Spock's coffin, having soft-landed, rests on the Genesis planet's surface."
48 Hrs.,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083511/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hard-nosed cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him in order to track down a killer. Oddball cop and tough guy, Jack Cates is the only survivor of a cop shooting and in hunting down the murderer collects Reggie Hammond from jail for 48 hours. Hammond is oddly motivated to help. The killer is searching for his stash of cash. Cates and Hammond who have the Black-white, cop-crook thing to work out make surprisingly good partners as they navigate through the city looking for their suspect.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> After a bloody shoot-out in a cheap hotel and a lost revolver, the gruff and tough San Francisco Police Department officer, Inspector Jack Cates, finds himself with the back to the wall. Now, to find the armed-and-dangerous escaped convict, Albert Ganz, Jack has no other choice but to team up with the fugitive's former partner, the smooth-talking prisoner, Reggie Hammond; however, there's a catch: the unlikely duo has only two short days to crack the case before Reggie returns to his cosy cell. Of course, apart from Ganz, those two have nothing in common, and as if that weren't enough, time is against them. But, a lot can happen in 48 hours. Can Jack and Reggie get the job done before they kill each other?—Nick Riganas Convicted robber Albert Ganz is working as part of a road gang in California, when a big Native American man named Billy Bear drives up in a pickup truck and asks for water to cool off his truck's overheating radiator. Ganz provokes Billy into a fight and when the guards try to break up the fight, Billy slips a gun to Ganz, and both shoot two out of the three guards. Billy is one of Ganz's partners in a gang of thieves and the fight was staged to help Ganz escape. Two days later, Ganz and Billy kill Henry Wong, who was one of their partners, leaving his corpse on a park bench.Later that same day, alcoholic San Francisco cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) joins two of his friends and co-workers -- Detective Algren and Detective VanZant -- at the Walden Hotel to check out a man named G.P. Polson, who is in Room 27. Jack waits downstairs while Algren and VanZant head to Room 27, where it turns out that G.P. Polson is Ganz using a fake name. Ganz immediately kills VanZant, and shoots Algren, while Billy attends to some other business in the room next door to room 27. Jack hears the shots and rushes upstairs, where Algren tells him to go downstairs and find Ganz and Billy. Jack confronts Ganz and Billy downstairs. When Algren makes it downstairs, Ganz takes Jack's gun and uses it to kill Algren, and then Ganz and Billy escape with Jack's gun.At the station, Jack is issued a new gun, a Colt .45, and fellow cop Ben Kehoe tells Jack about Ganz's former partner Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), who is in prison with 6 months to go on a three year sentence for armed robbery. Jack tells his loud and shouting boss, Haden, that he wants to work alone in the search for Ganz, and then visits Reggie at the prison.Though their first meeting goes badly, with Jack treating Reggie in a fairly racist manner, Jack gets the convict a 48-hour leave from the prison so he can help Jack find Ganz and Billy. Reggie leads Jack to an apartment that Ganz's only other partner, Luther, lives in.Jack and Reggie don't know that a few days ago, Ganz and Billy kidnapped Luther's girlfriend Rosalie. When Jack steps inside Luther's apartment and starts looking around, Luther runs upstairs to the apartment and fires a shot at Jack. Jack chases Luther to Jack's car, where where he left Reggie handcuffed to the steering wheel. Reggie opens the car door on Luther, knocking him down and taking his gun. Jack forces Reggie to give up the pistol and begins interrogating Luther. After getting nothing out of Luther, Jack puts Luther in jail. That night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender.With Jack watching and loaning his badge to him, Reggie harasses the customers until the bartender finally tells Reggie where to find Ganz's girlfriend Sally and Billy's girlfriend Casey. The apartment is on top of the Win Sun jewelry store in the Chinatown section of San Francisco. Jack and Reggie visit Casey and Sally, but get nothing out of them, nearly being beaten by them when they're mistaken for intruders.Back at the car, Jack, who knows Ganz is after something, demands that Reggie tell him what Ganz is after. Because Reggie has refused to tell Jack, Jack starts a fight with Reggie. After the fight, Reggie tells Jack that Ganz and Billy are after $500,000 hidden in the trunk of Reggie's car, which is in a parking garage. Reggie and his partners -- Ganz, Billy, Luther, and Henry -- had robbed a drug dealer of the $500,000 during a bad deal, and Ganz turned and betrayed Reggie.Jack and Reggie drive to the parking garage, parking across the street to watch the entrance. The next morning, Jack and Reggie see Luther, who has been released from jail, going into the parking garage. A few minutes later, Luther emerges with Reggie's car. It seems that Ganz has promised that Rosalie will be safe if Luther gets the money for Ganz. Jack and Reggie chase Luther to a subway station, where Ganz and Billy are waiting. Though Reggie and Jack find them there, Luther still escapes with the money Billy kills another cop with Jack's gun.That night, Jack is at his desk at the police station, and Reggie is at Vroman's, a place where people go to dance. When Jack calls Reggie, who answers on a payphone, Reggie tells Jack where he is, and Jack races to Vroman's to talk to Reggie, who is with a woman named Candy.Jack gives Reggie $20 so Reggie can go to the hotel across the street and have sex with Candy. Just as Reggie and Candy get out the front door of Vroman's, Reggie sees Luther board a bus driven by Billy. Reggie races back inside, and tells Jack. Jack and Reggie get in Jack's car, and in the bus, Luther gives Ganz the money, and then Ganz shoots Luther dead.Jack and Reggie then pull up beside the bus and a gunfight breaks out on the street. After Billy forces Jack to crash into a showroom at a car dealership, Haden chews Jack and Reggie out. Jack defends their actions and Reggie, saying he has more heart than most cops do. Later, Jack calls Kehoe, who hasn't heard anything on where Ganz may be.Jack thinks Ganz and Billy may be at Casey and Sally's apartment, so Jack and Reggie head back to the apartment, where Reggie finds Billy, and he shoots Billy dead. Ganz emerges from a room, and opens fire. Reggie and Jack chase Ganz out of the apartment and into a maze of alleys, where Ganz grabs Reggie and puts a gun to Reggie's head.Jack steps into the alley, and fires a shot that kills Ganz, and then when Ganz starts charging towards Jack, Jack fires six more shots, killing Ganz. Later, Jack lets Reggie have sex with Candy at her apartment. Jack shows Reggie his money in his car and tells him, it'll be there waiting for him when he comes out. He then drives away, presumably to take Reggie back to prison."
Poltergeist,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family's home is haunted by a host of demonic ghosts. A young family are visited by ghosts in their home. At first the ghosts appear friendly, moving objects around the house to the amusement of everyone, then they turn nasty and start to terrorise the family before they ""kidnap"" the youngest daughter.—Rob Hartill The Freelings are a typical suburban family. Husband Steve sells real estate in their ever expanding subdivision and Diane is a stay at home mom caring for their three kids, Dana, Robbie and little Carol Anne. Strange things being to happen in the house however: cupboard doors open on their own, furniture rearranges itself and chairs go sliding across the kitchen floor. It's a bit of whimsy at first but soon becomes deadly serious when Carol Anne vanishes into a nether world where, oddly, she can only be communicated with through the white noise on their television. A team of paranormal investigators move into the house but the forces that kidnapped are evil and powerful requiring the services of Tangina, a woman who has dealt with this situation before.—garykmcd Life is very pleasant for the close-knit Freeling family until a host of otherworldly forces invades their peaceful suburban home. It starts with just an odd occurrence or two, but soon their house is turned into a swirling supernatural sideshow. The forces at work are anything but friendly, and if the luckless Freelings don't clear out soon, they'll all be swept off into nightmarish chaos!—Anonymous Craig T. Nelson stars as Steve Freeling, the main protagonist, who lives with his wife, Diane, (JoBeth Williams) and their three children, Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), in Southern California where he sells houses for the company that built the neighborhood. It starts with just a few odd occurrences, such as broken dishes and furniture moving around by itself. However, a tree comes alive and takes Robbie through his bedroom window, and Carol Anne is abducted by ghosts. Realizing that something evil haunts his home, Steve calls in a team of parapsychologists led by Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight) to investigate, hoping to get Carol Anne back, so he can remove his family from the house before it's too late. In the suburban housing development of Cuesta Verde, California, the homes are modern and comfortable. Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) is a successful real estate agent who works for a firm headed up by Teague (James Karen), a developer. Steve lives in one of the Cuesta Verde homes with his wife, Diane (JoBeth Williams), and their three children: teenage Dana (Dominique Dunne) and preteen youngsters Robbie (Oliver Robbins) and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke).Strange events begin to occur when Carol Anne begins sleepwalking and carries on a seemingly one-sided conversation with a TV set that's turned on but has no signal. Soon thereafter her pet bird dies, and the family conducts a small burial service. Later that night, Carol Anne awakens again and talks to the television, while a spectral manifestation erupts from the television screen and enters the walls, causing an violent tremor that only the Freelings feel. As the family wakes up, Carol Anne mysteriously announces, ""They're here.""The next morning, drinking glasses inexplicably break at breakfast, and utensils bend by themselves. When Diane asks Carol Anne who she meant when she said ""they're here,"" she answers, ""The TV people."" At first the ghosts play harmless tricks and amuse the mother, including moving and stacking the kitchen table chairs. Diane and Carol Anne discover an area in the kitchen where an unseen force will pull anything, including people, across the floor. When he arrives home from work, Diane convinces Steve the phenomenon is real by demonstrating it. He then announces that ""Nobody's going' in the kitchen until I know what's happening.""During a terrible thunderstorm, a gnarled tree outside the kids' bedroom window suddenly comes to life and grabs Robbie (Oliver Robins), Carol Anne's brother, through a window. However, this is merely a distraction used by the ghosts to get Carol Anne's parents to leave her alone. Using a force like a wind tunnel, they take Carol Anne through her bedroom closet into their dimension. Steve rescues Robbie, and the family believes that a tornado caused the trouble, until they realize that they can't find Carol Anne. They search the entire house including the pit for the new swimming pool until Robbie hears Carol Anne calling for her mother eerily through the TV.A traumatized Steve meets with a small group of parapsychologists from UC Irvine, stating that ""We just want you to find our little girl."" Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), Ryan (Richard Lawson), and Marty (Martin Casella) are awestruck by the manifestations they witness. With the parapsychologists present, Steve shows them things they've never before seen. He opens the door to the children's room to reveal toys and other objects flying around by themselves and disembodied laughing voices reverberating throughout the room. Previously, Ryan described a Matchbox car taking seven hours to move seven feet, calling it ""fantastic. Of course, this would never register on the naked eye."" After they see the Freelings' house, they are all humbled.Over coffee (and a coffee urn that moves by itself), the parapsychologists explain to the Freelings the difference between a poltergeist and a haunting. They determine that indeed, it is a poltergeist they are experiencing.The group witnesses several paranormal episodes where they hear Carol Anne talking to Diane through the TV, see spirits, and hear the pounding footsteps of some terrible force, which subsequently injures Marty. Marty also suffers a terrifying hallucination where he seems to tear off his own face. The parapsychologists leave, with the exception of Ryan, admitting they need more help. Shaken and overwhelmed, Dana leaves to stay with friends. The Freelings also send Robbie to his grandmother's house for his safety.Later that day, Steve has a conversation with his boss, Teague, about a new housing project going up. They talk about how Steve's company has built over cemeteries in the past, even where the Freelings live now. Whenever the company needed land to build or expand housing communities, they'd move the cemeteries, coffins, headstones and all. Teague shows Steve a new housing development the company is building not far from where the Freelings live. As the two walk by a hillside cemetery, Teague tells Steve that he can have a new house right in that spot, with a large bay window overlooking the valley. Steve remarks that the house can't simply be built over a cemetery. Teague tells Steve that the company has moved whole cemeteries before: the coffins were dug up and moved, along with their headstones, to new locations nearby. Teague then reveals that much of Cuesta Verde was built on the location of one of these relocated cemeteries. Steve seems quite astonished at the news, stating that ""that's sacrilegious.""When the parapsychologists return, they bring a spiritual medium, Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein), a tiny woman who uses her psychic sensitivity to ascertain facts about the disturbances. Tangina tells them that Carol Anne is ""alive and in this house."" According to Tangina, the spirits haunting the home have left this life but have not gone into the spectral ""Light."" They are stuck in between dimensions, watching their loved ones grow up, but feeling alone, causing them to feel lonely and even angry. Carol Anne was born in the house and has strongest connection to it. At only 5 years old, she gives off her own life force that is as bright as the Light. It distracts and confuses the spirits, who think Carol Anne is their salvation. Hence, they have taken her.However, Tangina also warns everyone that a malevolent spirit also exists in the next dimension. It likes that the spirits are confused and lost, and uses Carol Anne as a distraction so they cannot move on into the Light. Tangina says ""it lies to her and tells her things only a child can understand. To her, it simply is another child. To us, it is the Beast.""They realize the entrance to the other dimension is through the children's bedroom closet. Tangina tests the dimensional portal with a few tennis balls that drop through the living room ceiling below the kids' closet. By tying a rope around a live person who can enter, and presumably exit the other side, with enough time to grab Carol Anne, they could bring her back. Tangina intends to be the one to go into the light, but Diane insists, saying that Carol Anne will only come to her mother. With the rope around her waist, Diane goes into the portal and Tangina coaxes the agonized spirits away from Carol Anne to the real Light. While Tangina is in her trance-like state telling the lost spirits to cross over into the Light, Steve panics and pulls on the rope, meeting the Beast face-to-face. Diane falls through the living room ceiling clutching Carol Anne and bearing new streaks of grey hair, presumably from fright; both Diane and Carol Anne are also covered in ectoplasm. After Steve revives both of them in the downstairs bathtub, Tangina pronounces that ""this house is clean.""Unfortunately, though the spirits have seemingly moved on, the Beast hasn't, and wants revenge. On their final night in the house, Steve leaves Diane alone with the children so he can go and talk to Teague, who presumably is trying to get Steve to reconsider leaving. While Robbie and Carol Anne are getting ready for bed, Robbie's clown doll comes to life and pulls him under the bed. Diane, relaxing in the master bedroom, hears her son's screaming voice and tries to investigate, but is pulled against the wall and ceiling by an unseen force. Robbie manages to rip the clown doll to pieces but a strange, mouth-like portal appears in Carol Anne's closet and attempts to suck the children in.Diane tries to get to her son and daughter but runs into the Beast itself, in the form of a snarling, skeletal demon. It blocks Carol Anne's and Robbie's door and lunges at her, causing her to fall down the stairs. Diane runs to the backyard to seek help from her next-door neighbors, but slips into the freshly-dug swimming pool. A rainstorm has filled it with rain and mud, and as Diane tries to escape, coffins begin erupting from the earth, releasing skeletal corpses into the pool. Her neighbors hear the commotion and arrive to help Diane out of the pool, but they refuse to enter the house with its windows now blazing with ghostly energy. Diane runs back into the house alone to get Robbie and Carol Anne. She finds Carol Anne and Robbie barely able to fight the energy that tries to suck them into the portal; they dangle from their bed frames, hanging on only by their hands, while their feet sway toward the closet door. Diane manages to pull them to safety and they run from the house.Coffins and bodies begin exploding out of the ground throughout the house. Steve pulls up in his car with Teague as a passenger, and they both see the dead bodies erupting from the ground. Steve recalls the earlier conversation he had with Teague, where Teague revealed that Cuesta Verde was built over the site of a relocated cemetery. It is now obvious that Teague never really relocated the cemetery, he simply built the housing development over top of the graves after moving only the headstones. Realizing this truth, Steve rebukes him in anger. Dana arrives in her boyfriend's car and is hysterical over what is happening to the house. The Freelings get into Steve's station wagon and they drive off. The Beast grows so angry that the house implodes through the portal into the other dimension as stunned neighbors (including Teague) look on. The weary family checks into a hotel for the night. Not wishing to tempt fate, Steve pushes the television set outside their room."

The Verdict,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084855/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An outcast, alcoholic Boston lawyer sees the chance to salvage his career and self-respect by taking a medical malpractice case to trial rather than settling. Frank Galvin was once a promising Boston lawyer with a bright future ahead. An incident early in his career in which he was trying to do the right thing led to him being fired from the prestigious law firm with which he was working, almost being disbarred, and his wife leaving him. Continually drowning his sorrows in booze, he is now an ambulance-chasing lawyer, preying on the weak and vulnerable, and bending the truth whenever necessary to make what few dollars he has, as he has only had a few cases in the last few years, losing the last four. His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouré Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out-of-court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high-priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost. Concannon's task seems even easier as Judge Hoyle, the presiding judge, is already biased against Frank for taking the case to court.—Huggo Frank Galvin is a down-on-his luck lawyer, reduced to drinking and ambulance chasing. Former associate Mickey Morrissey reminds him of his obligations in a medical malpractice suit that he himself served to Galvin on a silver platter: all parties willing to settle out of court. Blundering his way through the preliminaries, he suddenly realizes that perhaps after all the case should go to court: to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Frank Galvin (Newman) is a down-on-his luck lawyer, reduced to drinking and ambulance chasing. Former associate Mickey Morrissey (Jack Warden) reminds him of his obligations in a medical malpractice suit that he himself served to Galvin on a silver platter: all parties willing to settle out of court. Blundering his way through the preliminaries, listening to his own enthusiastic expert witness, and visiting the paralyzed woman, Deborah Ann Kaye (Susan Benenson) in a vegetative state in the aftercare home, Frank suddenly realizes that perhaps the case should go to court: to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer. To the astonishment of Mickey, Frank refuses a $210,000 settlement offer from the Arch Dioceses, and the hospital to settle the case.In his enthusiasm over his expert witness and his new found sense of purpose, Frank enters the bar where he usually hangs out and offers to buy everyone a drink. He notices a young woman, sitting at the end of the bar where he usually hangs out but she turns down his offer. The next night, after preparing for the case with Mickey, they see her at the bar again, and Frank decides that he is going to get laid. Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) does agree to have dinner with him and ends up at Frank's apartment for the night. Later while Frank is trying to line up his witnesses, Mickey gives Laura Frank's background, almost being disbarred when he was going to report the jury tampering that the senior partner of his law firm was doing. The senior partners turned the tables, and Frank ended up getting arrested for jury tampering, then released when he agreed to not persist. But Frank lost his partnership as well as his wife who was the daughter of the other senior partner.Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea) calls Frank Galvin and the lead defense attorney, Ed Concannon (James Mason), into his chambers to get a settlement, but Frank refuses, so they set the trial for the next week. Upon learning of the settlement, Sally Doneghy (Roxanne Hart) the sister of Deborah Ann and Sally's husband, Kevin Doneghy (James Handy), who wants to get this over with so they can move to Phoenix and have $50,000 left for the lifetime care of Deborah Ann in Massachusetts confront Frank. But he tells them that the offer had been withdrawn in the Judge's chambers.When he tries to contact his own expert witness, Frank finds that Dr. Gruber (Lewis Stadlen) has left town for a several week vacation in the Caribbean, and cannot be reached. Frank first tries to get a postponement, then tries to get the settlement that had been withdrawn by Concannon, but both efforts fail.In a hurry, Mickey and Frank contact Dr. Thompson, as a substitute expert witness. But when Frank picks him up at South Station, he sees that Thompson is in his 70's and black. He puts him in a cab for Frank's own apartment, so the defense cannot get to him. Then Frank tracks down Maureen Rooney (Julie Bovasso) the only operating room nurse who is not testifying for the defense, who shuts the door in his face. When Mickey's mock cross examination of Dr. Thompson is going badly, Frank is ready to give up, but Laura Fischer who has been in those sessions at Frank's apartment convinces him to keep fighting. It gradually becomes clear to the viewer, but not to Frank that the defense firm knows Frank's every move, with someone tailing him to Maureen's house and the team doing background research on Thompson, even getting a black attorney to sit with the defense team.When the trial starts, Frank has a rough opening and the testimony of Dr. Thompson is shredded by Concannon, with the help of Judge Hoyle. Later, Frank realizes that Maureen Rooney is protecting someone, and also realizes that the admitting room nurse is not a witness for the defendants. Frank tracks Maureen to her church, and through a ruse gets her to tell him where Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse) is after telling her that he had talked with Kaitlin earlier that day. Meanwhile, Laura is given an envelope with a check by Ed Concannon, for her help in spying on the plaintiff team. Then, with Laura in the room, Mickey and Frank spend all of Friday night trying to track down a Kaitlin Costello somewhere in New York.On Saturday morning Frank notices his phone bill in the mail in the office. He goes again to Maureen Rooney's house and finds her phone bill in her mailbox. Then he tracks the phone calls to New York, and calls the number. Pretending to be from a nursing magazine, he learns that Kaitlin Costello has married, and now is Kaitlin Costello Price. He also learns where she is working on the weekend, and he catches an Eastern Shuttle to New York. After booking the Shuttle, he calls Mickey and Laura to let them know that he has found Kaitlin.Laura answers and insists that she meet Frank in New York. But while she is on the phone with Frank, Mickey looks in her bag for cigarettes, and finds the Check from Ed Concannon instead. Mickey quietly puts it away and laves to get a pack of cigarettes. Finding Kaitlin with kids in a playground, Frank tries to establish a false identity and makes small talk, but Kaitlin notices the Eastern airline boarding ticket in his coat, and Frank asks her for her help. Mickey finds Frank in New York outside of his hotel, just before Frank hooks up with Laura in the Sheraton Bar. Upon meeting Frank slaps Laura hard enough to draw blood and knock her down. When she tells everyone to let him go, Frank leaves without another word.At the trial on Monday, Frank finishes his examination of Dr. Robert Towler (Wesley Addy) the anesthesiologist who gave the general anesthesia to Deborah Ann Kaye that caused her to vomit into her mask. Towler states that anyone who would have given general anesthesia to someone who had eaten a full meal only an hour earlier was criminally negligent, but he pointed out that the admitting record had stated that Deborah Ann had last eaten nine hours before the operation.Then Frank calls his new witness, Kaitlin Costello Price, who testifies that she had admitted Deborah Ann Kaye and noted that she had eaten only one hour before the operation on the admitting record. Under heavy cross examination by Ed Concannon, she testifies that she has a photocopy of the record that proves that she had put one hour on the form, but that it had been altered by Dr. Towler who claimed that he had been too busy that day to read the record before he went into the operating room. Concannon is able to cite a precedent to Judge Hoyle to have the photocopy suppressed, and then after the testimony is complete, he asks Judge Hoyle to instruct the jury to disregard all of Kaitlin's testimony.However, after a subdued summation by Frank, the jury brings in a verdict of guilty, and asks if they can increase the amount awarded to the plaintiffs. On the way out of the courtroom, Frank and Mickey are being congratulated, and see Laura standing across the vestibule. When they turn back after turning away, she is gone. Later Laura calls Frank's office, and lets the phone ring for a long while. He is still looking at the receiver while it rings as the film closes."
Gandhi,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life of the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest. In 1893,Mohandas K. Gandhiis thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.—gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com) The last fifty years of the life of Mahatma Gandhi leading to his assassination in 1948 is portrayed. In the late 1800's South Africa, then Indian-British attorneyMohandas K. Gandhitakes up the cause of fighting what he sees as racially discriminatory laws against colored people such as himself and other ethnic Indians. Being that South Africa is part of the British Empire, he is hoping that news of such in the British press will support his cause. Although violence is used against him by the authorities, his protests are only by peaceful means. Having made a name for himself as a motivator of peaceful action which he does not want confused with passivity, Gandhi returns to India in 1915, when he has now abandoned his western clothing for more basic self-made garb of shawls and loincloths. He is asked by prominent Indian figures of the day, such asJawaharlal Nehru,Vallabhbhai PatelandMuhammad Ali Jinnah, to join the fight for Indian independence from the British, despite some within that group believing Gandhi's methods ineffective. Because of internal religious conflicts between the Hindus and minority Muslims among others, the British believe that an Indian self-government would lead to chaos, which to Gandhi is beside the point. But Gandhi's ability to rally the troops is enough to strike fear in the British controlled authorities, who do whatever they feel they need to quash his quiet revolution while trying not to make him appear the martyr. Even if Gandhi and his cohorts are able to achieve independence for their homeland, Gandhi must figure out how to control the dissent between the Hindus and the Muslims. Among those documenting the process are American journalist Vince Walker and American photojournalistMargaret Bourke-White, both on the most part sympathetic to Gandhi's cause.—Huggo This acclaimed biographical drama presents major events in the life ofMohandas K. Gandhi, the beloved Indian leader who stood against British rule over his country. Dedicated to the concept of nonviolent resistance, Gandhi is initially dismissed by English officials, including the influential Lord Irwin, but eventually he and his cause become internationally renowned, and his gatherings of passive protest move India towards independence.—Jwelch5742 When Mohandas Gandhi first set foot in British India, he had already been to Britain and South Africa, and had created quite a stir for the betterment of the people. But in India, he realized that he had first to live the life of a peasant to understand what it is to be an Indian. This resolve will lead him to shed his westerners clothing, don a simple loincloth, mobilize awareness of local industry, lessen dependence on imported clothing and material, the historic Dandee march for withdrawal of the salt tax, a fast unto death to stop the virtual slaughter of British troops, and be imprisoned several times. His resolve was to work with stalwarts such as Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Sardar Valabhbhai Patel, Professor Gokhale, J.B. Kripalani, Maulana Azad, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to ensure first of all to get the British to quit India, and then run an Indian Government under the Congress party. Gandhi will soon realize that it is not enough to be just an Indian, for India has many facets - Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Christian. The British relied on these many facets as an excuse for their continuance as they wanted to ensure that the minorities are not oppressed. Concerned over the inroads made by Gandhi to unite the Hindus, Muslims, and all others under a common umbrella, the British invited Jinnah for talks, and it is here that a seed was laid for a separate country called Pakistan. When Gandhi came to know about this, he pleaded with Jinnah to unite the Muslims, even take over as the first Prime Minister with his choice of Muslim candidates for Parliament, but separatist Jinnah had already made up his mind. The World Wars of 1914 and 1944 having taken its toll on Europe, and on Britain in particular, the weary British finally decided to leave India in 1947 - not the India they had conquered - but an India that was ready to be divided in East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Now after the much awaited independence was the real test for Gandhi - a test that will make him or break him - as he started a fast unto death to try and stop the violence that was threatening to break out into a civil war.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) The story begins with the assassination of Mohandas K. ""Mahatma"" Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) in New Dehli, India on January 30, 1948 when he is shot by a young Hindu man three times in his chest. The following funeral procession is a long one and his body is conveyed on a jeep covered in flowers.The story flashes back to Gandhi's early days as an attorney in 1893 in South Africa. He is thrown off a train by the racist conductor for sitting in the segregated first-class compartment despite possessing a ticket to be there. He later stages a non-violent protest in the center of town where, with several police officers and officials present, he burns work permits that all non-Afrikaners are required to carry and present to police when demanded. Gandhi's reasoning is that the permits are an unfair and oppressive symbol of Afrikaner rule over minorities. As he burns them, he is struck by a police officer on the hand. Though quite plainly in pain, Gandhi continues to burn the permits, his will overcoming the blows from the officer. He is finally knocked down, unable to continue his protest and is arrested. Gandhi meets personally with General Smuts (Athol Fugard), the Dutch commander of South Africa. Smuts admires Gandhi's adherence to non-violent protest and frees him, saying he'll rescind the pass law for foreigners.When he's freed from jail, Gandhi reunites with his wife and children. He also meets a young British priest, Charlie Andrews (Ian Charleson), with whom he converses about the oppression of the masses by a handful of bureaucrats. While they walk, Gandhi is confronted by an angry youth (Daniel Day-Lewis in a bit part) and his friends. They demand that he pay them to walk down their street. Gandhi refuses in the face of obvious bigotry. When the young man's mother calls him inside, Gandhi and Andrews continue down the street.In 1915, Gandhi travels back to his home country of India. When he arrives there he is met by members of the press who know of his exploits in South Africa. They ask if he'll take up any political causes, especially those in opposition to the British rule of India. Gandhi politely refuses the requests, saying he's only going to his home city of Porbandar. His wife accompanies him. Gandhi's real plan is to organize a non-violent protest against Britain, knowing that millions of Indians will follow him. Very soon Gandhi realizes that the British rule of India is harsh and oppressive, having grown more so since he left to pursue his law degree and is growing worse each day.One of Gandhi's first public protests is against the British textile industry. He urges his followers to weave their own homespun cloth for clothing and other needs and burn the British cloth they've been forced to buy and wear for decades. However, many Indians, both Muslim and Hindu, stage more aggressive protests. The crowds become angry mobs when they are attacked by the police. Gandhi appears inwardly angry that his message has been misunderstood.He is later arrested by the British on charges of inciting the violence of his people. When he stands before the judge -- who himself stands in respect when Gandhi enters the court chamber -- he refuses to comply with the judge's decree to merely impose a fine on the defendant. The judge, though showing great respect for the defendant, sentences Gandhi to serve time in prison for several years.A few years later in 1919, in Amritsar, a city in Northern India, a group of Indian citizens gather in the Jallianwala Bagh garden to protest an unfair town curfew. Though the protest was peaceful, a British general, Reginald Dyer (Edward Fox), orders his troops into the garden. They take up firing positions in the courtyard. When one of his lieutenants suggests that the protest is peaceful, the racist Dyer says that the people have ""had their warning"" and commands his troops to open fire. Thousands, including women and children, are killed.A trial is held by the Hunter Commission, comprised of British and Indian officials. Dyer himself testifies and is at first quite proud and defiant, claiming he wished to ""inflict a lesson that would be felt through all of the India"". When asked if he'd ordered his troops to fire at the thickest part of the crowd, he says yes. He also states he would have used the machine gun on the tank that accompanied his troops (it was unable to fit through the narrow passage to the garden). When an Indian attorney asks Dyer if he attempted to help the wounded in any way, he becomes agitated and says he would have. A British official asks him how a wounded child that had been shot would be able to approach him for help. Dyer is silent.Nevertheless, the incident generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Gandhi, Jawarlalhal Nehru and several other officials representative of the Indian state and it's people, Hindu, Muslim and other cultures alike, meet with British nationals. Gandhi tells them that they are ""masters in someone else's home"" and they should leave India forever. The Brits argue that without their rule, India will likely tear itself apart. Gandhi retorts that there will be problems but they will be India's problems, not the British.Though Gandhi continues his wish for civil disobedience, riots continue to break out. Gandhi stages a personal fast as a means of protest. Though his action is successful, violence continues. In 1931, Gandhi stages his most famous protest: the Salt March. He marches 240 miles from his home to the ocean to make salt in defiance of British regulations. The march is a great success and further disrupts British rule. Gandhi continues his diplomacy with the other heads of the Indian state to insure that when India gains it's sovereignty that all the faiths of the country, chiefly Hindu and Muslim, will live together peacefully.After World War II ends, Great Britain finally grants Indian independence in August 1947 with India becoming a commonwealth. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest region and the eastern part of India (current-day Bangladesh) around Calcutta, both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muslim leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Alyque Padamsee) to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless with Jinnah becoming the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Pakistan. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nationwide violence. Horrified, Gandhi declares another hunger strike in the city of Calcutta, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually. While weak and barely able to speak, he is confronted by a Hindu man who confesses that while enraged over the death of his young son at the hands of Muslims, he killed a young Muslim boy himself. Gandhi tells the man how to achieve forgiveness: he must find a young boy whose own parents have been killed and raise the boy as his own -- but the boy must be a Muslim and the man must raise him as one.The aged and in ill-health 78-year-old Gandhi (aware that he might not live through the year) spends his last days in January 1948 trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many protesters on both sides, one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him.As Godse shoots Gandhi in a scene recalling the opening, the film cuts to black and Gandhi is heard in a voiceover, saying ""Oh, God!"" The audience then sees Gandhi's cremation; the film ending with a scene of Gandhi's ashes being scattered on the holy Ganga. As this happens, viewers hear Gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film:""When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but, in the end, they always fall. Think of it. Always."""
First Blood,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083944/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A veteran Green Beret is forced by a cruel Sheriff and his deputies to flee into the mountains and wage an escalating one-man war against his pursuers. John J. Rambo is a former United States Special Forces soldier who fought in Vietnam and won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but his time in Vietnam still haunts him. As he came to Hope, Washington to visit a friend, he was guided out of town by the Sheriff William Teasel who insults Rambo, but what Teasel does not know that his insult angered Rambo to the point where Rambo became violent and was arrested. As he was at the county jail being cleaned, he escapes and goes on a rampage through the forest to try to escape from the sheriffs who want to kill him. Then, as Rambo's commanding officer, Colonel Samuel Trautman tries to save both the Sheriff's department and Rambo before the situation gets out of hand.—John Wiggins On his way to meet an old brother-in-arms, the taciturn Vietnam War veteran, John Rambo, passes through the sleepy town of Hope, seven barren years after his discharge. There, the overzealous Sheriff, Will Teasle, takes an instant dislike to the unkempt vagabond, and without a second thought, arrests him for vagrancy. Once again, as distressing flashbacks of torture get the best of him, John finds himself entangled in a new war--this time, in the bosom of America--fighting tooth and nail for his freedom, up against the sadistic marshal's angry posse. Now, an entire town hunts Rambo down like prey, or is it the other way round? What fate awaits those who have drawn first blood?—Nick Riganas John Rambo is a disoriented Vietnam Vet. He is hitchhiking from town to town to see friends from the war. A sheriff tries to make him leave town and when he refuses, arrests him for vagrancy. While in jail, a deputy takes delight in abusing him. Rambo escapes showing his old Vietnam fighting skills and takes to the woods as the sheriff and deputies try and find him in his element. Things get out of hand as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's old commander, appears to shed light on the situation.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> John Rambo, a former Green Beret and Medal of Honor recipient, is plagued by the awful changes that are common in Vietnam veterans like himself. A drifter on his way to get some food, Rambo is arrested by Will Teasle, a small town sheriff who is used to getting things his way. Once incarcerated, Rambo soon finds himself reliving the awful memories of his fighting days in the 'Nam as he is put through the basic tests that are mandatory for all prisoners of the law. Rambo escapes and what follows is an intense manhunt for a man who only ""wanted something to eat."" As the publicity of Rambo's one man war escalates, Teasle and his posse are confronted by Colonel Trautman, Rambo's former commander and the only one who may be able to stop the terrible fate awaiting everyone involved.—Bug <junebug2@texas.net> John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a former member of an elite United States Army Special Forces unit and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service in the Vietnam War in which he was also a prisoner of war (POW). The film begins several years after Rambo left the war, in the American Northwest in 1980. Rambo is searching for one of his friends from his unit, Delmar Berry. Rambo soon learns from Delmar's mother that he has died a few months earlier from cancer due to Agent Orange exposure. Although not yet revealed to the audience, Rambo knows he is now the last surviving member of his unit. He leaves the picture of his unit with Berry's mother and walks away, obviously saddened.The scene fades to Rambo entering the small town of Hope, Washington State on foot, looking for a meal and possibly a hotel to spend the night. With his longish hair and military-style coat, he is quickly spotted by the town's overzealous and paranoid sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who quickly drives Rambo out of town, noting his strong distaste for ""drifters."" A defiant Rambo heads back toward town immediately, to the dismay of Teasle who arrests him for vagrancy and for carrying a large combat knife as a concealed weapon.Rambo stands his ground against the officers at the station and is brutalized and harassed by Art Galt (Jack Starrett), the sheriff's cruel head deputy and closest friend. Rambo is ordered to strip and Galt and his deputies, Ward (Chris Mulkey) and Mitch (David Caruso) are astonished to see his chest and back are covered with horrible scars. Galt viciously hits Rambo in the lower back with his police baton without provocation. A third officer sprays him with a fire hose to clean him up. When they attempt to dry-shave him with a straight razor in preparation for his court appearance, Rambo has a flashback to being tortured in a North Vietnamese POW Camp and loses control, instinctively using his military training to beat Galt and his comrades. He fights his way out of the station, retrieving his large knife. He assaults several more officers, pulls a civilian off a motorcycle, steals it, and is pursued into the nearby mountains. Teasle chases him into the wilderness but ends the pursuit when his car overturns. Further up the mountain, Rambo spills the cycle he stole and runs up past the treeline. He finds an old sheet of canvas and some wire, making a tunic for himself. He ventures further up the mountain, into the forest.The deputies are eventually forced to search for Rambo on foot and he climbs down onto a steep cliff to elude capture. After spotting Rambo from a helicopter, Galt blatantly disregards procedure and attempts to shoot him in cold blood. Rambo drops off the cliff into a mass of trees and cornered, throws a rock at the helicopter in self-defense. The helicopter, struck by the rock thrown by Rambo and due to strong updrafting, pitches, causing Galt to fall to his death. Teasle, who did not see Galt's attempt to kill Rambo, vows to avenge his friend's death. After tending to a deep cut in his upper arm, Rambo attempts to surrender, he's shot at by Teasle's men and retreats into the woods.Teasle leads his deputies on a manhunt into the rugged forest. The deputies are inexperienced and bicker, particularly after learning over the radio about Rambo's combat experience, and that he's a Green Beret and a war hero. Rambo quickly disables the small, disorganized team using non-lethal guerrilla tactics and booby traps, severely wounding all the deputies and takes one deputy's walkie-talkie. In the chaos, Rambo, wearing heavy natural camouflage, isolates and confronts Teasle, holding his knife to the sheriff's throat and saying, ""Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go..."" he warns before disappearing into the woods.A base camp is assembled near the site and the National Guard is called in. Just after the National Guard informs Rambo -- who is listening in on the radio he'd stolen -- that he is surrounded by their forces. United States Special Forces Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives, taking credit for training Rambo and telling the sheriff that Rambo has been trained to survive in harsh environments and to engage superior numbers in combat. He is surprised to find any of the deputies still alive and warns that it would be safer to let Rambo go and find him a few days after the situation has calmed down, suggesting that Rambo can be apprehended without a fight. Fueled by a mixture of scorn and pride, the hot-headed Teasle refuses to heed the advice. Teasle allows Trautman to talk to Rambo. Trautman tries to convince Rambo to give himself up, however, Rambo refuses in his response, citing his deplorable treatment by Teasle and his men. Trautman suggests that Rambo shouldn't have fought back so harshly, to which Rambo states ""They drew first blood, Sir."" Rambo switches the radio off. By the time the conversation ends, Teasle's men have triangulated Rambo's location on the mountain.Rambo is eventually cornered by the National Guard troopers at the entrance to an abandoned mine, where he has taken refuge. The novice guardsmen fire a M-72 LAW's rocket at him, collapsing the entrance and trapping him inside. They assume Rambo is dead. Unbeknownst to his pursuers, Rambo has escaped into the tunnels of the mine. Rambo finds some old fuel and makes an improvised torch. After wading through waist-deep water and fighting off rats, Rambo cleverly uses the flame of the torch as an indicator of air flow to find an escape to the surface.Rambo hijacks a passing U.S. Army M135 2.5 ton cargo truck, throws out the driver, crashes through a roadblock and returns to town, crashing it into a gas station. He blocks the highway to anyone in pursuit by igniting the spilled fuel on the road, also destroying the stolen truck. Armed with an M-60 machine gun, Rambo then goes on a shooting spree in town as the residents flee. Rambo, using his experience at guerrilla tactics, takes out power transformers, blacking out part of the town. Rambo shoots up and destroys a sporting goods shop, spilling gunpowder and ammunition over the floor and igniting it. The tactic works as a distraction and Rambo spots Teasle on the roof of police headquarters.After shooting up the building, Rambo carefully enters the police station. Aware of Teasle's presence on the roof, Rambo darts under the skylight to draw fire as bait to reveal his exact location. Teasle immediately fires at Rambo who notes his position and returns fire through the ceiling with the M-60, injuring him. Teasle falls through the skylight onto the floor. Rambo steps over him, prepared to kill him. Before Rambo can shoot Teasle, Colonel Trautman appears and tells him that there is no hope of escaping alive. Rambo, now surrounded by the police, rages about the horrors of war in Vietnam and the difficulties he has faced adapting to civilian life. He's tired of being misunderstood, and how in the Army he was a war hero but back in America he could not even be trusted to work ""parking cars."" He weeps as he recounts a particularly gruesome story about witnessing his friend dying by having his legs blown off by a booby-trapped shoeshine box planted by a Viet Cong child operative. Rambo then turns himself in to Trautman and is arrested. The credits roll as he and Trautman exit the police station."
The Toy,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084809/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An underemployed reporter finds himself literally purchased as a toy for a rich spoiled brat. On one of his bratty son Eric's annual visits, the plutocrat U.S. Bates takes him to his department store and offers him anything in it as a gift. Eric chooses a black janitor who has made him laugh with his antics. At first the man suffers many indignities as Eric's ""toy"", but gradually teaches the lonely boy what it is like to have and to be a friend.—Paul Emmons <pemmons@wcupa.edu> Former newspaper journalist Jack Brown, now a down-on-his-luck night janitor at business tycoon U.S. Bates' department store, catches the eye of his pampered son, Eric. And just like that, Jack becomes the boy's playmate, or better yet, his living toy, for an entire week. As Jack degrades himself to pay his mortgage, he soon discovers that Eric is an unhappy son looking for a genuine friend and a loving father. But first things first. Will the privileged kid learn that money can't buy everything?—Nick Riganas Jack Brown (Richard Pryor) is an unemployed newspaper reporter living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana who is in danger of losing his house to the bank since he and his wife, Angela (Annazette Chase), cannot make their mortgage. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get a job working for the local paper, The Bugle, he becomes so desperate that he ends up taking a job as a ""cleaning lady"" for U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason), an uptight and ruthless businessman who owns the paper and many other businesses in Louisiana. Jack is humiliated as he clumsily attempts to serve food at a luncheon. He is fired, but quickly lands a part-time job as a janitor in a department store owned by Bates.The following evening, ""Master"" Eric Bates (Scott Schwartz), the 10-year-old, spoiled-and-rotten, brat son of the boss, arrives home from the military academy where he attends and his father sends him to the store and he is told that he ""can have anything he wants in the store"". Amused at seeing Jack goof around in the store's toy section, Eric informs his father's long-suffering right-hand man, Sydney Morehouse (Ned Beatty), that what he wants is Jack Brown himself. Morehouse fails to convince Eric that human beings cannot be owned. Jack is literally ""boxed up"" and taken to the large Bates mansion that sits on the outskirts of the city. At first, Jack refuses to have any interaction with the brat Eric, but Bates offers him a deal: in exchange for a generous financial settlement, Jack reluctantly agrees to be Eric's live-in friend during Eric's one-week spring break from military school.Emotionally estranged from his father, Eric takes a liking to Jack but still manages to humiliate him with numerous pranks during the first day and night. After a particularly humiliating incident in the mansion incited by Bates' ditsy and floozy, much younger trophy wife Fancy (Teresa Ganzel), who literally introduces him at a dinner party as Eric's new ""toy,"" Jack grows tired of the situation and leaves. The next day, Jack agrees to return only when U.S. Bates (with Morehouse as his proxy) offers Jack so much money to be Eric's live-in friend for one week, that Jack will not only pay back the bank and numerous bill collectors, but Jack will be able to pay back the entire mortgage on his house as well.Jack returns to the Bates estate, determined to teach Eric how a friend is supposed to be treated. Over the next several days, they slowly bond while participating in mini-cart racing, video games, and even fishing in a stream filled with piranha. Both Jack and Eric begin to open up to one another with stories about their personal lives. Jack tells Eric about him growing up poor and having to look out for oneself. Eric tells Jack about his mother's death when he was very young which his grumpy father tries to forget about by putting all his time in work and leaving no time for anything else while marrying again and again.Over time, Jack sees that Eric isn't the ""bad seed"" that he puts out to people, but just a mistreated and neglected boy who wants attention and whom is spoiled by his father. Used to getting things his way since all his father ever does is give him gifts and money (calling it love and affection) Eric throws fits when things do not go his way. Eric is so spoiled and hyper-competitive that he enjoys beating Jack at video games, mini-cart racing and board games a little too much. One day, when Jack begins winning at a two-person basketball game, Eric, seeing that he is losing, refuses to play anymore and walks off the court. When Jack scolds Eric for quitting because he is losing asks if he would like to tell Eric's father that he is a quitter as well as a sore loser. Eric replies with the most touching and dramatic line in the movie: ""my father doesn't care what I am... as long as I stay out of his way.""Another day later, Jack and Eric decide to start a newspaper of their own for fun. After witnessing multiple examples of Bates' cruelty to his housekeeping staff and workers, they dig up dirt on him, such as a story of how he won his elderly and long-suffering butler, Barkley (Wilfrid Hyde-White), in a game of billiards. Jack and Eric then break into Bates newspaper office after-hours as well as the factory to print their paper, but get discovered by the police. At a police station, Eric manages to create a diversion by setting off some firecrackers creating confusion and panic in which Jack and Eric quietly walk out of their jail cell, and out of the front door.Afterwards, Jack and Eric publish their paper, titled 'The Toy' and distribute free copies of it throughout the city. Morehouse finds a copy and, being the ever loyal toady that he is, shows it to Bates and he is outraged. Bates quickly calls Jack and Eric to his office to confront them both, but he keeps his anger in check. Bates orders Jack and Eric to shut down their paper which he sees as humiliating to him and the Bates dynasty. However, Eric is unapologetic and wants to continue the paper. To prove to his son that money can buy anything (including loyalty), Bates offers Jack a reporting job with his newspaper at the end of the week... which is what Jack wanted all along. When Jack accepts, Eric becomes upset and runs out of the office. Outside, Eric scolds Jack for selling out as all of the people that Bates does business with. Jack tells the boy that most men (especially disenfranchised African-American men such as himself) need jobs, just as his priority is to support himself and his wife.At the climax, an swanky outdoor party is held at the Bates estate, attended by prominent citizens who are supporters of a senator (Ray Spruell). They are unaware that members of the KKK are also in attendance. Jack's wife, Angela, tries to bring attention to this with her anti-Klan group that are camped on the Bates mansion in a protest demonstration, but Jack convinces her to leave. He learns the true reason for the party is to get the KKK Grand Wizard (Orwin Harvey) and Senator Newcomb together in a picture, which Bates would then use to blackmail the senator. Senator Newcomb's daughter Honey Russell (Linda McCann) is also in attendance at the party and is accompanied by her husband (Stocker Fontelieu) who is a local district attorney investing Bates for shady business deals and corruption, in which Bates is also hoping to get D.A. Russell a photo op with the Grand Wizard to blackmail him too to stop his investigation of his business activities.Jack and Eric team up one last time to disrupt the party and they crash the events on their mini go-carts where Jack announces to everyone about the Grand Wizard's identity. Jack embarrasses the Grand Wizard by causing him to fall into a bowl of chocolate fudge. The Grand Wizard throws a pie at Jack, but hits a policeman instead, leading to his arrest. Chaos ensues which leads to Jack and Eric driving their mini-carts around the party, knocking down tents, ruining displays, and people jumping out of the path of Jack and Eric's mini-carts into various desert trays which leads to a huge pie-throwing fight among the guests. Bates chases after Jack in a golf cart but ends up crashing into the pool. Jack saves him from drowning since Bates cannot swim, and it seems all is forgiven. That evening with the week up, Jack packs up and returns to his neighborhood to his wife, riding away on a bicycle while Eric sadly waves goodbye.The next day, while riding with Eric in a limousine to the airport to return to military school, Bates tries desperately to have a heart-to-heart talk with his son, but he is not very good at it. All Eric talks about is Jack and that he misses him. Bates tells Eric to forget about Jack. While on the runway to board Bates' private jet, Eric runs off, making his way to Jack's house. Jack refuses to let Eric live with him and gently admonishes Eric to give his father a chance. Bates shows up and offers the newspaper job to Jack again and promises Eric that next year for spring break he can spend one week with him and one with Jack, much to Eric's joy. After they leave, the senator's daughter, Honey Russell, shows up in another limo informing Jack that Fancy has recommended him to look after her son, Eugene, for a few weeks who is home from his own military academy on spring break. Eugene (Davis Hotard) peeks out from the top window and shoots Jack in the forehead with a toy dart... revealing that he is MORE spoiled and obnoxious then Eric. A crazed Jack runs away down the road in fear over this 'here-we-go-again' situation as the end credits roll."
Firefox,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083943/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pilot is sent into the Soviet Union on a mission to steal a prototype jet fighter that can be partially controlled by a neuralink. The Soviets have developed a revolutionary new jet fighter, called ""Firefox"". Naturally, the British are worried that the jet will be used as a first-strike weapon, as rumors say that the jet is undetectable on radar. They send ex-Vietnam War pilot Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) on a covert mission into the Soviet Union to steal the Firefox.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> The Soviets have developed the MiG-31, a fighter that flies at six times the speed of sound, is invulnerable to radar, and worst of all, has a lethally sophisticated weapons system that the pilot can control through thought impulses. As soon as the pilot detects a threat, either visually or on a scope, his thought impulses will direct a missile to that threat, without so much as pushing a button. Mass production of the MiG-31 will give the Russians a huge advantage. Vietnam veteran Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), a former U.S. Air Force ace pilot, is smuggled into the U.S.S.R. to infiltrate the Russian airbase at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox/MiG-31 is being finished, and steal the Firefox. Gant manages to overpower Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wulff), the Russian test pilot, and steal the aircraft, just as the U.S.S.R.'s First Secretary (Stefan Schnabel) arrives at the base. Now Gant will run the gauntlet of Russian defenses, land-based missiles, Naval warships, and helicopters, and reach a refuelling point from a U.S. Navy submarine. But the Russians still have a trump card, a prototype MiG-31, and they send it up in pursuit of Gant after he completes refuelling. What follows is a harrowing, cat-and-mouse chase across the ice floes of the Arctic. Who will survive?—Derek O'Cain The Firefox is a high tech fighter plane built by the Soviet Union. It's faster than any other fighter plane, and is undetectable to radar, and has a new weapon control system that is thought controlled. When the West learns of it, they decide that it's necessary to get it before it could be mass produced. They need a pilot, and the best and probably only man for the job is Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), a former Air Force pilot, who is now retired. They convince him to do it, even though the chance of his success is very slim. He begins by pretending to be a man who the Soviet Police are investigating, when he goes to meet his contacts which includes the man he is impersonating, he is killed. The sight of his death brings about one of Gant's delayed stress attacks, but he gets away. With help from the underground, he is brought to where the plane is. Though he manages to get it, the Soviets mount an offensive to find him, which includes another version of the Firefox, which catches up with him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), once one of America's finest fighter pilots, is recruited by N.A.T.O., despite continuing bouts with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (incurred in a harrowing mission in which he was captured by the Vietcong, but rescued by U.S. Air Force choppers), for a suicide mission. Soviet Russia has developed the ultimate fighter-bomber, the Firefox. A stealth warplane capable of sustained Mach six speeds and possessing revolutionary thought-guided weaponry, the Firefox can tip the balance of international power, and the prototype's seat is form-fitted for just one pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wulff), to whom Mitchell Gant is the only Western pilot with the identical physical build necessary for the special pressure suit worn. N.A.T.O. contacts amongst Soviet dissidents smuggle Gant through Russia to the Red Air Force's testing facility in southern Ukraine, where he must steal the Firefox, and escape the wrath of the world's most powerful air-defense grid, and of a second Firefox prototype.—Michael Daly A large Sikorsky helicopter flies over the Alaskan wilderness, its pilots looking for someone below. That someone, Major Mitchell Gant USAF (Rtd) (Clint Eastwood), hears the helicopter approaching and instantly breaks into a dead run back toward his cabin, where he takes a shotgun off its rack and cocks it. As the helicopter lands, Gant lapses into a post-traumatic memory of a nightmare that he lived through in Vietnam: shot down over the North in his F-105 jet, he was being taken to a prison camp when two Hueys machine-gunned his captors. Gant suffered personal trauma when two overflying A-1 Skyraider planes dropped incendiaries on the site, killing a little girl who stood around too long, watching the battle. Back in the present, Captain Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) pulls Gant out of his episode and apologizes for the unannounced visit.The next several scenes are back-and-forth cuts between the conversation between Gant and Buckholz, and a briefing being run by Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) of the British SIS concerning the Soviet Union's latest fighter/interceptor: the Mikoyan-Gurevich ""MiG"" Model 31, given the codename ""Firefox"" by NATO. Its capabilities seem otherworldly: total stealth, twin engines each delivering 50,000 pounds of thrust, combat ceiling 100,000-plus feet, speed in excess of Mach 5 or even Mach 6 (and able to maintain it, no small feat), and a weapons and defense system able to read the pilot's thoughts and allow him to aim and fire his weapons without even having to press a button, thus affording him a 3- to 5-second reaction-time advantage over any opponent. NATO's decision is to send Gant in to steal a Firefox prototype right off the Soviet development base at Bilyarsk, hundreds of miles east of Moscow, near the Ural Mountains.Gant resents the operation because he is being quite simply blackmailed; he has been allowed to live on government land which now will be sold out from under him if he does not agree to the mission. The NATO Air Force attache (Thomas Hill) resents it as well because Gant has no experience as a spy and, worse yet, is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder and may crack at any time. They use Gant for two reasons only: he speaks fluent Russian and happens to be a perfect fit for the pressure suit worn by the MiG-31's prime test pilot, Lt. Col. Yuriy Voskov (Kai Wulff).Gant goes through several weeks of retraining, both in flying and in aerial combat, and briefings on his first required impersonation--as a corrupt businessman named Leon Sprague, known to be smuggling heroin into the Soviet Union. After his training is over he is sent to London where Aubrey gives him his final briefing on his objectives and he's disguised with a new haircut and a false mustache. Gant is also familiarized with the underground network group, who are mostly Russian Jews. Aubrey also hands him a one-way homing device disguised as a cheap transistor radio. What his handlers don't tell him, though, is that if anything compromises the mission, Gant will be left on his own.Gant lands at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, blusters his way through an unannounced customs search, and manages to leave the airport--with the ""radio."" He takes a taxi to his rooms at the Hotel Moscow, puts the radio into his pocket, and waits. Outside he sees three Soviet soldiers goose-stepping in formation while patrolling.In the meantime, at KGB Moscow Center on Dzerzhinsky Square, Colonel Kontarsky (Kenneth Colley) of the KGB finalizes his plans to safeguard the MiG-31 prior to its trials the next day which will be conducted for the Soviet First Secretary. He also orders his second-in-command, Dmitri Priabin (Oliver Cotton), to arrest some underground members at dawn, but not to move before then. Kontarsky in fact knows all about the spy network funneling information from Bilyarsk out of Russia--but even he does not know what the CIA and the SIS really have planned and as such, he does not want to totally disrupt the network, causing them to go further into hiding.That night Gant walks out to the Krasnokholmsky Bridge, under instructions to be there at precisely 10:30 with the KGB shadowing him -- he is ordered not to lose the KGB tail. There he meets the real Leon Sprague (George Orrison), plus his Moscow network escort, Pavel Upenskoy (Warren Clarke), and two of his confederates. Upenskoy orders Sprague to take Gant's cigar away from him and start smoking it--and then, before Gant's horrified eyes, whips out a pipe and clubs Sprague to death, mutilating the man's face. He then demands that Gant surrender his false papers, which he plants on Sprague before throwing him into the Moscow River. The four men then race to the Paveletskaya Metro station, where Upenskoy hurriedly briefs Gant on his next impersonation: as Michael Lewis, American tourist registered at the Hotel Warsaw. The four then board a subway, though Gant nearly misses it, because his bad dream of the burning girl returns at just that moment.The four ride the train to another station, but when they arrive the KGB is all over it. A KGB plainclothesman challenges Gant for identification, and Gant barely manages to convince him that he is who he says he is, and has to feign illness on account of the ""rich food"" at the Warsaw Hotel. Upenskoy, dissatisfied with Gant's performance, sends the flustered Gant into a nearby men's room to ""get yourself together."" But another KGB plainclothesman (Eugene Lipinski) follows Gant into the restroom, challenges him again, and then says that his papers are not in order. The plainclothesman reaches into his coat. Gant, thinking the man is going to draw a gun, grabs his arm and finds the man was only holding a wallet. Gant fights with the agent and kills him.Upenskoy, rushing in at the last minute, is horrified. When the dead agent is discovered, the entire station will be locked down. He tells Gant to move quickly to the exit and angrily assures Gant this papers are, indeed, in order. Gant manages to leave the station, but only by cutting in line and acting like a clueless American. He, Upenskoy, and Upenskoy's colleagues barely manage to get to street level before whistles blow below, indicating that the KGB have found their dead detective and have sealed off the station.Upenskoy takes Gant to a warehouse belonging to a light-delivery service, where Upenskoy gives Gant yet another identity: that of Boris Glazunov, resident of the Mira Prospekt and employed as ""driver's mate"" to Upenskoy. The next morning, a telephone rings--just once--and Upenskoy tells Gant that they must leave at once because ""KGB assigned to the plane"" are coming for Upenskoy. Upenskoy gives Gant a pistol with orders not to use it unless absolutely necessary.Kontarsky, meanwhile, has word that Priabin has already picked up the real Boris Glazunov (Barrie Houghton) at his apartment, indicating the man in the van with Upenskoy is an imposter. Curious, Kontarsky orders a KGB tail team not to arrest Upenskoy but to tail him at a distance.Upenskoy and Gant manage to get through a checkpoint, where they know that they must ""pose"" for a photograph that will be sent to Moscow Center. Afterward, Upenskoy tells Gant that Boris Glazunov was picked up, and that Gant needs to realize that he is now a man of mystery. Upenskoy has decided to assume that the KGB will merely wait to see what develops as they try to identify Gant, who to them is simply someone who pretended to be a Russian driver's mate for some reason still unknown to them.In the meantime, Sprague's former business associate identifies the body of Sprague but notes that he was badly beaten, almost as though his assailant wanted to obscure his identity, a thing that Police Inspector Aleksei Tortyev (Hugh Fraser) is very curious about indeed. Kontarsky is also curious, and demands to know who the mystery man is with Upenskoy, and why an old man (Czeslaw Grocholski) arrested at the warehouse took a poison and the others are ""holding out."" Kontarsky still refuses simply to arrest Upenskoy, because he wants every member of the spy network, no matter what--this although his officers now suspect that the mystery man is a foreign agent. Priabin is also present, and voices his suspicion that Boris Glazunov, now their prisoner, is totally ignorant of the identity of his substitute and perhaps even of the substitution.Upenskoy reaches Gant's next rendezvous point and orders Gant to jump from the van while it is in motion as soon as they round a curve. Gant thus succeeds jumping out undetected while Upenskoy leads the tail car away. Gant jogs down an incline and meets his next contact: Dr. Semelovsky (Ronald Lacey), a grumpy project scientist assigned to the MiG-31 program. Semelovsky hides Gant in his trunk and prepares to drive in to the base at Bilyarsk.At Moscow Center, Boris Glazunov, refusing to the end to talk (or perhaps, as Priabin suspects, not knowing what to say or even what the KGB wants), dies under torture. Kontarsky, monumentally chagrined, now orders Upenskoy's van stopped.Oblivious to the new developments, Semelovsky gets Gant inside the Bilyarsk compound (excusing his tardiness by pretending to have a dirty engine) and drives him to the scientists' quarters, where Gant now meets Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne) and his significant other, Natalya (Dimitra Arliss), who offer him his first meal of the day. Meanwhile, Upenskoy gets into a gunfight with the KGB tail team and manages to kill them--but not before they wound him. He crashes his van, abandons it, and sets out on foot, knowing that his life is forfeit but still determined to lead them away from Gant.Baranovich outfits Gant as a Soviet Air Police officer and briefs him on how to bluff his way through a security gate, and on the location of the hangar and its facilities. He also tells Gant that he knows that he will die after Gant escapes with the plane--but any resentment he might feel toward the British SIS for ordering him to sacrifice himself, pales before his resentment of the KGB for making that sacrifice necessary, and for denying him his freedom.At Moscow Center, Aleksei Tortyev asks Priabin to do him a favor: to ask for an identification of the man who landed at Sheremetyevo Airport posing as the dead Sprague. Tortyev thinks that this man is a foreign agent who substituted himself for Sprague. The technicians then surprise Tortyev and Priabin by saying that the man at Sheremetyevo is the same as the man who posed as Boris Glazunov and got out of Moscow on the way to Bilyarsk.Natalya brings word that the guards at the gate have been reinforced--and almost has a heart attack to see Gant outfitted as a Soviet Air Policeman. Baranovich reveals more dire information: that the program has not merely one prototype, but two. The second jet has an advantage over the 1st; it can refuel in the air, whereas Gant must rendezvous with an American submarine on an ice floe off Russia's Arctic coast. Baranovich also explains that he and his small dissident crew intend to sacrifice themselves by destroying the second prototype in the hangar. Gant must, therefore, get the first prototype out of the hangar as soon as he hears the fire alarm. Baranovich also briefs Gant on the coordinates he must feed into the navigation computer, and the Firefox' weapons (four air-to-air missiles, two 50-millimeter cannons, and two flak layers, called ""rearward defense pods"" or ""drone tail units"") and thought-activated control systems--but also says that in order to work it, he must ""think in Russian"" and not try to think in English and translate.Dmitri and Tortyev continue to discuss their lead. Tortyev then suggests that Dmitri search not for a seasoned spy, but for ""a young fit man with brains""--i.e., an astronaut or a pilot. Dmitri agrees and commences a systematic search of their thousands of files on astronauts, Air Force pilots, etc.Gant manages to get inside the security gate and, using his falsified rank, takes it on himself to order an extra K-9 patrol to search the forest bordering the fence. He then walks through the hangar and sees the Firefox for the first time. A colonel (actually Kontarsky, though neither man knows the other) accosts him, and Gant apprises him of his orders to the K-9 unit to search the forest. Gant then moves to the pilot's dressing room, and waits there for Voskov, whom he knocks senseless, binds, gags, and stuffs into a locker, having decided not to kill him because ""Oh, hell, you didn't do anything."" Gant then goes into the showers and waits, at one point demanding that he not be disturbed when other security personnel challenge him for identification. Gant, now impersonating Voskov, manages to keep them from seeing him face-to-face. (Kontarsky has in fact realized that his mystery man has penetrated the installation and ordered a search.) While he waits, he suffers another attack of his PTSD and sits helpless on the floor of the shower.Back at Moscow Center, Priabin has now identified Gant from the pilot archive. He and Kontarsky speculate as to Gant's real plans: is he merely trying to inspect the plane up close? The two come to a terrifying realization that Gant means to steal the plane. Kontarsky immediately orders the arrest of Baranovich and the others--but just then the fire alarm rings; Baranovich and Semelovsky have started the fire that they hope will destroy the second prototype. The fire is put out before it can do any such damage. Semelovsky is shot down at once, and Baranovich manages to get off one round with a pistol before he and Natalya are also gunned down. The sound of the alarms in the hangar awaken Gant from his shock. The last thing that Baranovich sees before he dies is a black pressure-suited figure making its way to the first prototype.Gant, like a man knowing what he is doing, walks over to the waiting plane, climbs aboard, hooks up, and starts going through a very accelerated pre-flight checklist. An officer challenges him for identification, and Gant first waves him off, but when the officer climbs to the cockpit Gant pushes him off the small ladder. Gant hurriedly completes his checklist--but when he raises his visor, Kontarsky recognizes him at once and orders the hangar doors shut. They are too late--Gant starts the engines and taxis out of the hangar at high speed. As the First Secretary's car arrives, Gant taxis to the end of the runway, and then takes off just as the First Secretary arrives. A few miles away, Upenskoy watches Gant fly overhead and then, with the K-9 patrols ready to apprehend him, shoots himself.Gant first makes a deliberate close pass at an Aeroflot Ilyushin-model airliner, a deliberate strategy to confirm his heading traveling south, possibly to Turkey. He then begins a cockpit monologue--which turns into a dialogue with the First Secretary (Stefan Schnabel), who tries to persuade Gant to turn back and surrender, which Gant will not do. Gant finishes his conversation and then turns eastward, toward the Ural chain. The Soviet chiefs of staff, meanwhile, scramble all their air assets on the northern and southern borders and alert the Red Banner Fleets Northern and Southern. In a NATO war room, Aubrey and Buckholz realize, with great joy, that Gant has achieved liftoff.Gant reaches the Urals, and then makes his first mistake: impelled by insatiable curiosity, he test-flies the Firefox at supersonic speeds, seeking to test the power of the plane and its Terrain-Following Radar system. The Soviets realize that he has misled them, as the Air Force chief-of-staff, General Vladimirov (Klaus Löwitsch), has already realized. Vladimirov reasons that Gant was simply too good to blunder into an Aeroflot's flight path by accident. Vladimirov now orders an elaborate plan to trap Gant at the northern end of the Urals, over the Gulf of Kara, where he believes that Gant may have a fueling rendezvous waiting for him on a sheet of ice. The Soviets think they have succeeded when they detect explosions over the Gulf (and so do Aubrey and Buckholz), but in fact Gant has devised a new strategy to elude them. He has downed another of their planes, a ""Badger"" recon plane, using the thought-controlled arsenal for the first time, and to good effect. This makes the Badger hotter than the Firefox and thus decoys the heat-seeking missiles the Soviets have fired after him.Vladimirov is not so sure that they could defeat Gant as easily as that. Sure enough, Gant wastes his advantage by overflying an ELINT trawler. The First Secretary excoriates Vladimirov, but can do little else; he cannot fire him on short notice. Vladimirov now sets up an ambush with a Soviet guided-missile cruiser. But Gant defeats that ambush, too. First he flies straight toward the cruiser, at low altitude and supersonic speed. He destroys one MiL-24 Hind helicopter gunship, and flies directly over the ship. The sonic boom slams a second Hind to the flight deck, demolishing it. Four missiles fire after him in a tail chase. Gant knocks out two of them with one of his Rear Defense flak layers, and simply outraces the other two a supersonic speed until they run out of fuel and fall into the sea.Back in Bilyarsk, Voskov has been found and has recovered, taking a final briefing from the First Secretary before taking off after Gant. Word comes that Gant has defeated the Russians yet again, and now Vladimirov plans to intercept Gant just short of the polar ice pack.Gant now has another problem: he is running out of fuel, though he at least knows where his refueling point will be, since the homing device activated before he engaged the cruiser. Gant gains altitude and proceeds to glide in--and barely makes it to an ice floe before a US Navy Ohio-class submarine breaks through it to serve as Gant's refueling stop. He lands on the floe and taxis to the submarine, whose crew proceed to refuel him and replace the two missiles he has used.Two Hinds make radar contact with the Americans and fly in to investigate. The Americans hurriedly finish the refueling and rearmament, steam a runway, and see Gant off before they then set up a mock weather station for the Soviets to reconnoiter. But what they don't know is that Vladimirov, loudly insistent, has prevailed upon his colleagues to send the second MiG after the radar contact.After Gant takes off, he thinks he's home free when he suddenly sees two missiles locked onto him that appear to have come out of nowhere--and then spots the second Firefox in his rear-ward monitor. He out maneuvers the missiles and Voskov pursues Gant in a hypersonic aerial chase. Gant uses his air brakes to slip behind the other aircraft and he releases two missiles that immediately miss, and after a rolling loop Voskov and Gant's positions are reversed again. Gant dives toward the ground and skims low over the Arctic, but Voskov stays hard in pursuit, firing his MiG-31's nose-mounted cannons, to no effect. Gant now tries to shake Voskov by flying a slalom race through narrow ice canyons - yet Voskov still stays locked in close pursuit. After clearing and regaining altitude Voskov's Firefox fires his last two missiles, and Gant pulls into a high loop. As he comes out of the loop he goes into a flat tailspin and begins to suffer another delayed stress seizure, but he snaps out of it and releases his landing gear, adding drag enough to barely pull out of the flat spin before he crashes into the Earth.Voskov, out of respect, salutes Gant one last time before dropping in behind Gant, preparing to make the kill. Gant recovers in time to reengage full speed as Voskov futilely fires his 50mm cannon. Gant attempts to fire the Rear Defense Pod but forgets to think in Russian. When he finally realizes it, he issues the command again in Russian and Voskov's aircraft is hit by the missile, exploding in flame.Finally safe, Gant sets a course for the nearest NATO base in Western Europe."
The Dark Crystal,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083791/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On another planet in the distant past, a Gelfling embarks on a quest to find the missing shard of a magical crystal, and to restore order to his world. Another planet, another time. One thousand years ago, the mysterious Dark Crystal was damaged by one of the Urskeks and an age of chaos has began. The evil race of grotesque birdlike lizards, the Skeksis, gnomish dragons who rule their fantastic planet with an iron claw. Meanwhile, orphan Jen, raised in solitude by a race of the peace-loving wizards called the Mystics, embarks on a quest to find the missing shard of the Dark Crystal which gives the Skeksis their power and restore the balance of the universe.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} A distant planet. A different time. One fate. Centuries ago, the Dark Crystal cracked and brought forth two races. One is the villainous lizard like birds called the Skeksis, who have taken control of everything. The other are a peaceful race of wizards called the Mystics. A young Gelfling named Jen is sent by his dying master to find a Crystal Shard, which is being held by the wise witch Augra. Now, Jen must journey far and wide to figuring out the purpose of the Shard and work quickly to saving his world from the Skeksis' wrath.—Blazer346 In the age of wonder somewhere in the faraway realm of the innocent Gelflings and the gentle lumbering Mystics, the cruel vulture-like Skeksis have been ruling the land with an iron fist for a thousand years, deriving their power from a life-giving magical crystal. However, with a dying emperor and a vital shard of the gemstone missing, Jen, a fearless Gelfling and the last of his kind, sets off on a perilous adventure to mend the Dark Crystal, as he follows the clues of an ancient prophecy which foretells the end of the evil dictators. But, the dangers are countless, and this is a nearly impossible quest. Heroic as he may be, can a single Gelfling bear the burden of an entire planet's salvation on his shoulders?—Nick Riganas Another world, another time, in the age of wonder, the world of Thra is under the rule of the cruel Skeksis. To save Thra from the Skeksis' tyranny, The Mystics and two gelflings named Jen and Kira will save the world from The Dark Crystal.—Johnny The film takes place on Thra, a planet with three suns; the Great Sun, the Rose Sun and the Dying Sun. Many creatures and races inhabit the planet but the dominant race is the urSkeks who are the guardians of the Crystal of Truth. The Crystal harnesses the forces of nature, especially the light of the three suns, for the benefit of all on Thra.One thousand years before the beginning of the movie, the urSkeks cracked the Crystal of Truth, and split into two races during the Great Conjunction of the three suns - the hunchbacked, gentle beings known as Mystics (or urRu in the original drafts and novelization), and the vulture-like, cruel bipedal beings known as Skeksis. In that moment the Crystal became the Dark Crystal. The Skeksis drove the Mystics from the castle, where the shattered crystal resides, and instituted a reign of terror over their world. Their wrath was particularly directed toward the elf-like Gelflings due to a prophecy that promised the restoration of the crystal and the end of the Skeksis' power by a Gelfling. The prophecy, rediscovered in an ancient Gelfling city, read:When single shines the triple sun,
What was sundered and undone
Shall be whole, the two made one,
By Gelfling hand, or else by none.Jen believes he is the last of the Gelflings. After his parents were killed by the crustacean-like Garthim commanded by the Skeksis, he is raised in a lush valley in which the Mystics reside. The Mystic Master who taught and raised him him is dying, and he calls Jen to his side to reveal that his destiny is to ""heal"" the crystal by replacing the crystal shard. He tells Jen that the crystal shard can be found at Aughra's observatory. The emperor of the Skeksis, skekSo, dies at the same time that the Master urSu does. In a duel over the succession called Haakskeekah (trial by stone), the Chamberlain skekSil is defeated by skekUng, the Garthim Master, and is banished and driven from the palace in rags.Jen reaches Aughra, a wise woman character of unknown species, and discovers the actual crystal shard by playing music on his flute, to which it resonates and stands out from the other crystals with which it lies. He must unify the shard with the crystal from which it sprang in time for the Great Conjunction, when his world's three suns will be aligned with one another. If the conjunction occurs before the Crystal is healed, the state of their world will become permanent, with the Skeksis ruling forever as immortals. Garthim arrive to capture or kill Jen, who flees as Aughra is taken prisoner and her observatory is destroyed.Meanwhile, the Mystics hear the call of the Crystal, and begin their trek back to the castle.By a river, Jen is frightened by a ball-shaped, dog-like pet known as Fizzgig and meets another Gelfling, Kira, whose existence he never suspected. They stay for a night amongst the bulbous Podlings who raised Kira and are then attacked by Garthim there. Kira, Jen, and Fizzgig escape the attack, but many Podlings are captured by the Garthim. In frustration and despair, feeling responsible for the Garthim raid, Jen discards the crystal shard. Kira reassures him that he had nothing to do with the attack, ""It wasn't your fault... the Garthim have always come.""In the morning, as they awaken, they discover one of the houses of the old Gelfling City, where Jen cites the prophecy of the Crystal and recovers the shard, although Kira faces apprehension about entering the ruins (""Bad things happened in here once"" is her sentiment). Jen and Kira are confronted by the disgraced skekSil, who offers to help them, but they refuse. Riding on furry, long-legged Landstriders, the Gelflings quickly arrive at the castle of the crystal, just in time to see the Garthim that attacked Kira's village. Kira, followed by Jen, ride to attack the Garthim and try to free the captured Podlings while the Landstriders fight the Garthim to distract them from the rescue effort.The Gelflings fail to rescue the Podlings and find the Garthim, after subduing the Landstriders, closing in on them at the edge of the deep, rocky moat that encircles the castle. Sweeping Jen and Fizzgig into her arms, Kira jumps off the cliff... revealing that female Gelflings have wings. At the bottom of the gully, Jen and Kira end up at the Teeth of the Skreesh, an undefended sewer entrance to the lower parts of the castle. skekSil meets them again and attempts to convince them to offer peace to the Skeksis. As Jen and Kira attempt to escape, skekSil grabs Kira's arm in protest. Worried for Kira's safety, Jen strikes skekSil, using the crystal shard as a dagger, wounding skekSil's arm. Concurrently, a Mystic, urSol, suffers a spontaneous wound on his arm in the same location. During this time Fizzgig also attacked skekSil by biting him and renting chunks of cloth from his ragged robes. Enraged, skekSil forces Jen into a wall, inciting a cave-in. skekSil then takes Kira prisoner, believing Jen to be dead.For capturing Kira, skekSil is restored to his position as Chamberlain. The Skeksis require Gelflings to make their ""everlasting essence"", a potion that restores youth and strength. The emperor decides to regain his youth by draining Kira's life essence. It is revealed that the potency of the ""everlasting essence"" and the Crystal prophecy feared by the Skeksis fueled their genocide of the Gelflings. Only a few drops of the ""everlasting essence"" are drawn from Kira before she calls out to the animals imprisoned in the laboratory, who break free and attack the Skeksis overseer and scientist, skekTek. skekTek falls back into a volcanic pit, killing him. Concurrently, one of the mystics travelling to the castle, urTih, disintegrates into flames at the same time. Kira escapes, and the link between her and Jen gives him the strength to escape the cave-in.In the central interior chamber where the crystal is housed, Jen alights upon the Crystal but the shard falls from his hands. Kira throws the shard back to him, returning it to Jen. In so doing she leaves herself open to attack, and she is killed by the Skeksis Ritual Master, skekZok. At the conjunction of the three suns, Jen seals the shard, unifying the crystal. The Garthim shatter (who were originally created by the Skeksis, and so are not truly living beings) and the Mystics and Skeksis reunite into their original urSkek incarnations. The urSkek communicate directly to the consciousness via mystical sign language. One of them, UngIm, restores Kira to life, and they leave this plane of existence as the crystal has been healed and made whole. The crystal is dark no longer and has been returned to the Crystal of Truth and the world too has been similarly healed."
Conan the Barbarian,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young boy, Conan, becomes a slave after his parents are killed and tribe destroyed by a savage warlord and sorcerer, Thulsa Doom. When he grows up he becomes a fearless, invincible fighter. Set free, he plots revenge against Thulsa Doom. Beyond the mists of time, having witnessed the brutal death of his blacksmith father and the massacre of the entire village by the murderous followers of Thulsa Doom, the undead evil wizard and servant of the serpent-god, Set, Conan, the orphaned young Cimmerian, is condemned to a life of slavery. Chained to the perpetual Wheel of Pain, the helpless boy grows into a man, and after years of rigorous training as a fierce gladiator, Conan, now an unstoppable mountain of muscle, regains his precious freedom. But, with the image of the blood-soaked raid etched on his mind, Conan teams up with Subotai, the Hyrkanian thief, and Valeria, the Queen of the Bandits, and embarks on a peril-laden journey to the mysterious Mountain of Power, and the impregnable Snake Cult Temple. Will Conan avenge his parents?—Nick Riganas A village is attacked by the evil ruler of the Snake Cult, Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones) and his evil warriors, when Thulsa Doom and his warriors kills his parents, a young boy named Conan (Jorge Sanz) is enslaved. Years later, Conan grows up and becomes a mighty warrior and is trained as a fighter. After years as a slave and as a gladiator, Conan is set free. Conan sets out on a quest as he vows to avenge his parents and solve the riddle of steel. Joined by a archer named Subotai (Gerry Lopez), a beautiful thief who falls in love with Conan, Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and a Chinese wizard (Mako), Conan and his companions sets out to rescue Princess Yasmina (Valérie Quennessen), daughter of King Osric (Max von Sydow), from the Snake Cult, and get his revenge on Thulsa Doom and avenge his parents.—Daniel Williamson When his mother (Nadiuska) and father (William Smith) are killed in a raid by the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), Conan (Jorge Sanz) is sent to a slave camp. As the years pass, he develops into a powerfully-built man, still determined to get revenge for his parents' death and solve the riddle of steel. He learns that Thulsa Doom is the head of a mysterious snake cult and in his attempts to get closer to the evil sorcerer Conan makes some powerful friends and many deadly enemies.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> Conan was still a child (Jorge Sanz) when he saw his parents murdered and his village burned by a horde of savages, lead by the semi-god Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones). They took him to the north, where he grew up working like an animal, and was later sold as a slave. His master trained him to be a warrior, and made a fortune by using him in fights. But there comes one day, when he gives Conan his freedom, and the chance to take his revenge after so many years.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> During the Hyborean age, ""a time of high adventure,"" a blacksmith, Nial (William Smith) creates a masterwork sword. The sword is completed, Nial shows it to his son, Conan (Jorge Sanz), teaching the boy about their god, Crom, who lives in the Earth, and ""the Riddle of Steel"" which every warrior must solve before they can enter Valhalla. He adds that he should not trust men, woman, or beasts, ""But this you can trust,"" indicating the sword he has crafted.It is winter in Conan's forest village, home to Conan's people, the Cimmerians. Conan is still young (8-10 years). Mysterious black riders, bearing a strange standard of a serpent with a head on each end surmounted by a black sun and moon suddenly and savagely attack the village. The villagers fight bravely, but they are not soldiers, and do not last long. Nial kills several of the attackers, but eventually felled by the group's attack dogs.As the brutal attack winds down, Conan's mother Maeve (Nadiuska) is the only adult still alive. She stands guard over Conan with her own sword, holding the little boy's hand. The leader of the attackers, Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), a mysterious black man with straight hair and piercing blue eyes, approaches the pair with his two hulking lieutenants, Rexor (Ben Davidson) and Thorgrim (Sven-Ole Thorsen). Maeve stands her ground bravely but is hypnotized by the piercing eyes of Doom. Doom, having taken Nial's sword from Rexor, suddenly wheels and beheads Conan's mother. A grief stricken and terrified Conan watches as Thulsa Doom keeps the sword his father made. Conan and the village children, the only survivors, are led away in chains as slaves while their village burns.Conan and some of the children are sold to a tribe called the Vanir and join other children at a gigantic outdoor grain mill, called the Wheel of Pain. They begin pushing the spokes of the wheel, and time passes quickly. The child Conan becomes an adult (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the camera pans out to show that he is now the only one left pushing the wheel. Conan has become enormously muscular by the time the mill is shut down and he is led away in chains.Conan is purchased by a large, red-haired warrior (Luis Barboo) who employs him as a pit fighter. At first Conan is puzzled by the violence, but quickly learns hand-to-hand combat with a variety of weapons. He becomes a champion, winning much gold for his master. His master then takes him to the Far East where he is trained in all manner of combat skills, weaponry, and philosophy. Finally one evening his master, after having drunk too much, decides to free him.The freed Conan finds himself being chased by wolves across the country-side. Climbing a cairn of rocks for safety he discovers the tomb of an Atlantean general and liberates his ancient sword and other equipment for protection. Outside, as the wolves approach, Conan uses the sword to free himself from his shackles and wait for the wolves to attack him, a smirk of victory on his face.Now equipped with the basics, Conan travels until he comes to the hut of a beautiful woman (Cassandra Gava), whom appears to have some knowledge of mysticism. She invites him in and she offers to tell him his fortune. Conan says that he's looking for a ""standard"" (a symbol) of a single serpent with two heads that face each other on a sun-like disc. Later while they make love she cries out that Conan will find the symbol in the land of Zamora. Moments later, she shape-shifts into a demon and Conan is forced to throw her into the fire. She explodes in flames, turns into a fireball and races around the hut and out through the surrounding woods. Conan is left alone to ponder the incident.The next morning, he finds a man chained behind the hut. His name is Subotai (Gerry Lopez) and he is a thief. Conan releases him and they team up. Subotai introduces Conan to thievery as a profession and they move from town to town practicing their trade, Conan asking those they meet if they have seen the strange serpent symbol. One old man tells them that there is a snake cult of growing power with temples in many towns including this one, but he does not know if they use the symbol he seeks.Subotai and Conan decide to raid the temple, rumored to have great treasures including a huge ruby called the ""Eye of the Serpent."" As they prepare to climb the temple's tower they become aware of a woman in the shadows. They confront her finding that she is also a thief, named Valeria (Sandahl Bergman). They decide to join forces. After climbing the tower Valeria checks out the upper level while Conan and Subotai continue down into a pit containing the ""Serpents Eye"" guarded by a humongous snake. Fortunately the snake sleeps while the two steal all they can. On the upper level a ceremony is taking place presided over by Rexor. There, a young girl (Leslie Foldvary) strips and prepares to throw herself into the snake pit to be consumed by the serpent as a sacrifice. Conan is leaving when he sees a medallion on the wall that matches the symbol of Doom's marauders that destroyed his village. He steals the medallion, however, he lingers too long and the snake awakes and attacks. He and Subotai manage to kill it, however, without disturbing the ceremony at the top of the pit. The ceremony reaches its climax and the girl throws herself into the pit. It is only then discovered that the snake is dead. Rexor send guards after the thieves, but they escape.Over the next days the three thieves celebrate too hard and are easily captured by the King's guard. Brought before King Osric (Max von Sydow) they expect punishment, but are surprised when the King congratulates them for standing up to the cult. He commissions them to go after his daughter, Yasimina (Valérie Quennessen), who has been seduced by the cult and travels to meet its leader, Thulsa Doom.Valeria, who has fallen in love with Conan, does not want to risk their current happiness and advises against going after the princess. She awakens the next morning to find Conan gone. He travels alone to find Thulsa Doom not just to rescue Yasimina, but also to avenge the murders of his parents and clan.Conan travels to Thulsa Doom's ""Mountain of Power"" temple in the east. Before he arrives he comes to a sacred place with many standing stones attended by an old wizard, Akiro (Mako). They quickly become friends, and the wizard warns Conan of Doom's power.Conan disguises himself as a follower and goes to the Temple of Set. The temple consists of a massive set of steps up the side of the mountain leading to an ornate entrance into caves that honeycomb the peak. Stealing a priest's robes, he gets as close as the steps before one of the guards recognizes the medallion he carries as being stolen. Thorgrim and Rexor seize Conan, beat him, and drag him before Thulsa Doom, who chides him for stealing the Eye of the Serpent and killing the great snake, a pet of Rexor's. Conan replies that Doom killed his parents, but Doom did so much killing as a young man that he does not really remember the incident. He also explains that ""steel is strong but flesh is stronger"" a point he proves by coaxing one of his female followers to step off a nearby cliff, falling to her death. Doom orders that Conan be crucified on the ""Tree of Woe.""Conan is left in the desert, nailed to the ancient tree. He is nearly dead when he is finally rescued by Subotai. Subotai and Valeria take him to Akiro for healing. The wizard paints Conan with the script of an ancient language and several symbols and tells them that this night the spirits of the underworld will come and try to take Conan's spirit back with them. Valeria says that she will fight them. Akiro warns that the gods will extract a heavy price for defying them in such a manner, but Valeria tells him she is willing to pay it.They successfully fight off the spirits, saving Conan. Conan finds that the Doom's mountain has cave entrances on the far side connecting with the interior of the temple. The three paint themselves with warrior camouflage and enter the temple through the rear, quietly killing the guards. They work their way to the throne room were an orgy is in progress; the participants are also eating a green stew made of human flesh. They set the drapes on fire and attack creating chaos in the throne room. Rexor recognizes Conan and attacks him with a double-bladed axe, he is soon joined by Thorgrim, wielding a large warhammer. Conan is nearly overpowered, but Thorgrim's warhammer dislodges a pillar, causing some of the ornate masonry to fall on him and Rexor, giving Conan a chance to flee. Valeria grabs Yasimina and they escape. The girl is unwilling to leave, however, and Conan is forced to carry her on his shoulders. He is unable to kill Doom, who has changed himself into a giant snake and escaped the throne room through a small tunnel.The thieves get to their horses and ride away with the princess. Doom, back in human form, arrives at the rear entrance with Rexor and Thorgrim, swearing revenge. Using an enchanted snake as a poison arrow, Doom manages to wound Valeria in the leg at a great distance. She tells Conan about Akiro's earlier warning of paying the gods, then dies in his arms. Back at the place of the standing stones, Conan burns Valeria's body in a warrior's funeral. Yasimina is tied to a nearby rock and she shouts to Conan that the funeral pyre will be seen by Doom and he will attack. Conan smiles as if he wants Doom to come to him.At the place of the scared standing stones, Conan, Akiro, and Subotai prepare a defense. They set booby traps around the stones and place defensive spikes. Conan finally prays to his god, Crom, asking him to remember that today two will stand against many, and that if Crom doesn't wish to help Conan, so be it.Doom comes with his lieutenants and a horde of men. He stands on a distant hillside and watches the battle. Despite being outnumbered Conan and Subotai dispatch most of his troops. Thorgrim is killed by one of Conan's elaborate traps. As he watches Thorgrim die, Rexor, wielding Nial's sword, attacks and nearly kills Conan. He is about to deliver a killing blow when a Valkyrie-like figure intervenes, then asks Conan if he wants to live forever. It is the ghost of Valeria, dressed in shining armor. She has fulfilled a promise she made to Conan that she would come back from the dead, if necessary, to fight by his side. Reinvigorated, Conan finally slays Rexor, breaking his father's sword.Seeing that his men have lost, Doom decides that if he cannot have Yasimina, nobody will, and prepares another enchanted snake arrow to kill her despite the girl's desperate pleas. Subotai, however, races up the hill and is able to block the snake with his shield at the last moment. Doom rides off, and Yasimina now appears to be free of his indoctrination.The scene switches to the mountain temple were Doom is conducting a night ceremony. Throngs of his followers stand on the temple steps holding lit torches. Conan appears behind Doom. When Doom sees him he tells Conan that Conan cannot kill him because Doom is the only purpose Conan has in his life. For a moment Conan is taken in by Doom's enchanted voice and hypnotizing stare like his mother was years before, but then breaks free from the spell and beheads Doom with the hilt of Nial's broken sword. He holds Doom's head up to the crowd, and then tosses it down the steps. Seeing that their leader was not immortal as they thought, the crowd douses their torches in the temple's pool and all quietly depart.Conan sits on the steps of the temple, alone, thinking about what to do next. He throws a burning oil lamp into the temple, setting it ablaze and returns Yasimina to her father. Akiro speaks, telling us that Conan will have many adventures. The scene switches and we see an older Conan sitting on a throne. A text crawl informs us Conan will one day become a king by his own hand, but that this is a story for another day."

But what they don't count on is how to survive the honeymoon. When a professional couple who have lived & worked together for many years finally decide to marry, their sudden betrothal causes many unexpectedly funny and awkward difficulties. They soon find that being married is often quite different from being ""best friends.""—Ary Luiz Dalazen Jr. <ajr@fortalnet.com.br> Richard Babson and Paula McCullen are successful Hollywood screenwriting partners, best friends, roommates and lovers. They decide to take the next step in their relationship by buying a house together. Because of the symbolism of the house purchase, Richard is able to convince an initially reluctant Paula to get married, her reluctance due to it meaning that she has to be a grown-up in life, just one of her many neuroses. In agreeing to get married, Paula in turn is able to convince Richard to take a cross-country train trip first to visit her parents in Buffalo, New York for a week to help celebrate their fortieth anniversary, then to Vienna, Virginia to visit his parents for a few days, Paula and Richard who have yet to meet their respective in-laws. Beyond the pressures they face from their producer Larry Weisman concerning their latest screenplay, Richard and Paula may not be able to survive not only as a married couple but as a partnership in all its aspects on this trip, as each not only can see into the future of their spouse by his/her parents, but the state of marriages in all their facets the longer they progress. The situation is exacerbated by their marriage being placed under a microscope by those around them.—Huggo"

Is there anyone that can put an end to Jason's murderous rampage?—A Martinez Picking up from the previous film's events with a flashback sequence, Jason (Richard Brooker) has survived his attack from Paul and Ginny, and migrates to a store where he changes clothes and then murders the store owners, the henpecked Harold (Steve Susskind) with a meat cleaver into his chest and his shrewd wife Edna (Cheri Maugans) with a knitting needle through the back of her head, before moving on to a nearby lake front property named Higgins Haven.At the same time, 18-year-old Chris Higgins (Dana Kimmell), who was attacked by a mysterious, disfigured stranger in the woods near Crystal Lake two years earlier, returns to the property with her friends; Debbie (Tracie Savage), Debbie's boyfriend Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), dim-witted prankster Shelly (Larry Zimmer), Vera (Catherine Parks), and stoners Chuck (David Katims) and Chilli (Rachel Howard). After meeting Abel, an inebriated, religious fanatic derelict who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) at their destination; Higgins Haven. Chris intends to face her fears; however, none of her friends know that an unmasked and reclusive Jason has taken refuge in the barn to recover from his wounds.Meanwhile, Shelly and Vera go shopping at a local supermarket to get food and supplies when they get into trouble with a three-person biker gang, called the Black Widows, led by a brutal woman named Fox (Gloria Charles). When Shelly accidentally knocks over their motorcycles outside the store, Fox and her two minions Ali (Nick Savage) and Loco (Kevin O'Brien) follow Shelly and Vera back to Higgin's Haven. However, they are dealt with by Jason before they can do any real damage except for taking the gas out of the gang's van. While looking around the barn in fascination, Fox is murdered with a pitchfork to her neck. Loco looks for her and gets impaled with another pitchfork. Ali is next when he enters the barn and finds the two's corpses. He attacks the unseen Jason, but gets bludgeoned with a 10"" pipe wrench.At nightfall, Jason continues lurking around the barn while spying on the kids who settle down for a party at the nearby cabin. When Chris and Rick go for a walk in the woods, Jason wanders out of the barn to cause more harm again. At first, Jason only harasses them from a distance. When Chuck goes to an outhouse to take a dump and smoke more pot, Jason walks past and bangs on the walls of the outhouse before retreating.Later, Shelly, wearing a wet-suit and a Red Wings hockey mask plans another scare prank against Vera who is siting on a pier beside Higgins Lake. After Vera angrily tells Shelly to go off, he wanders into the barn where Jason slits his throat and takes his hockey mask, now concealing his deformity. Taking the spear-gun that Shelly had with him, Jason (fully masked) walks out of the barn and sees Vera wading out in the shallow water to get Shelly's wallet after she accidentally drops it in the water. Thinking it's Shelly, Jason shoots Vera right in her left eye, killing her as her body falls in the water. Jason then discards the spend spear-gun.With Vera killed, Jason finally sneaks into the house, where he continues onward with his killing spree. After Andy and Debbie have sex, she goes to the bathroom for a shower, but gets surprised by Andy, who is walking on his hands. Jason sneaks up to him and horizontally murders him with a machete. Debbie leaves the shower and rests in her hammock in her bedroom, where she soon discovers Andy's horizontally-split body hanging from an overhead plank and gets stabbed through the hammock with a kitchen knife. Next, Jason disables the power to the cabin by tampering with a fuse box. When Chuck goes to the basement to fix it, Jason approaches him from behind and shoves his face on the circuit panel, electrocuting him. At the same time, Shelly, who is still alive, stumbles into the cabin before dying where Chilli finds him. She is quickly attacked and killed by Jason who shoves a hot fireplace poker through her stomach.When Chris and Rick return they find the place empty. They split up to find out what's going on. Rick, outside, is attacked by Jason, who kills him by crushing his head. One of his eyes pops out.After finding the corpse of Loco, Jason then confronts Chris with a felling ax, and a climactic chase ensues with the two of them exchanging attacks. During this chase, she slows him down by knocking a bookshelf onto him, then stabs him in his left leg with the same knife used to kill Debbie (Just before Jason throws it at a wall, which nearly hits Chris), and then bashes him with a fireplace log. Chris tries to escape in the van and almost hits Jason, but it soon runs out of gas (due to the biker gang's vandalism), forcing her to run back to the barn to hide.Jason enters the barn and arms himself with a machete and confronts Chris on the barn's rafter, but she manages to subdue him by bashing him on his head with a shovel. She defeats Jason by tying him to a rope and hanging him, but Jason survives the hanging and briefly shows his real disfigured face to Chris while trying to get the noose off his neck. She recognizes him as the man who attacked her two years ago. As Jason proceeds to attack Chris with his machete, one of the bikers, Ali (who survived his attack), attempts to get revenge on Jason, but Jason cuts off his right hand and kills him. While Jason is killing Ali, Chris picks up a felling ax and slams it down to Jason's skull, causing him to stagger and fall over, seemingly killing him. Chris then wanders over to the lake and falls asleep in a canoe that drifts into the middle of the lake.The next morning, she wakes up in the canoe, when suddenly she sees Jason (now unmasked and bloody from the ax cut) appearing from an upper window, causing him to run outside to the lake to attack, but sees that it was just a part of her imagination. Reliving, suddenly she gets pulled into the water by a decaying Mrs. Voorhees (who has her head still intact).It is revealed that it was just a disturbed nightmare and at some point later, the police take Chris (mentally disturbed from the events) off the property into the police car as they drive off. The film ends with Jason's deceased corpse, still with the ax intact in his head and showing the lake in peace once again."

Hacker/arcade owner Kevin Flynn is digitally broken down into a data stream by a villainous software pirate known as Master Control and reconstituted into the internal, 3-D graphical world of computers. It is there, in the ultimate blazingly colorful, geometrically intense landscapes of cyberspace, that Flynn joins forces with Tron to outmaneuver the Master Control Program that holds them captive in the equivalent of a gigantic, infinitely challenging computer game.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} Marginalised, with his hard work stolen from the ruthless executive, Ed Dillinger, and fired from the mighty ENCOM corporation, the innovative computer engineer, Kevin Flynn, has nothing but time to collect evidence of theft. Up against an ever-watching master control program--the MCP--Flynn's digitised alter ego will unexpectedly find himself transported in an alternate electronic universe, where oppressed small-scale applications are forced to compete with each other or face destruction.

In response, he is split into molecules by a digital laser and transported into ENCOM's computer. In this computer, a megalomaniacal program called Master Control dominates the digital world like a dictator. Flynn who programmed a number of features of the environment he got into, teams up with a bookkeeping program and his girlfriend, and together they try to replace Master Control with Tron.

Flynn has been trying to hack into ENCOM's mainframe computer to find evidence that ENCOM's senior executive Ed Dillinger stole five video games he created. But Dillinger's supercomputer Master Control Program foils Flynn's efforts and dictates and controls most of the computer systems. One night, Flynn's former girlfriend Lora Baines and her boyfriend, ace computer programmer Alan Bradley helps Flynn break into ENCOM to shut down the MCP with Alan's security program Tron. But MCP uses Lora's matter transmission program and converts Flynn into data and sends him into the computer.

With help from Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan), he gets into the company, and starts poking around the computer system. But he has not counted on Dillinger's powerful artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program (MCP). The MCP is self-aware and has been stealing other computer programs across the world. Instantly realizing what Flynn is up to, and not wanting to see his human patron ruined, the MCP uses an experimental laser to ""digitize"" Flynn, turning him into a computer file, which is then in at his mercy.All of the programs in the System appear to be humans, with the faces of their ""users"" (aka creators) and glowing lines on their unisex costumes.

Blade Runner,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A blade runner must pursue and terminate four replicants who stole a ship in space and have returned to Earth to find their creator. In the early twenty-first century, the Tyrell Corporation, during what was called the Nexus phase, developed robots, called ""replicants"", that were supposed to aid society, the replicants which looked and acted like humans. When the superhuman generation Nexus 6 replicants, used for dangerous off-Earth endeavors, began a mutiny on an off-Earth colony, replicants became illegal on Earth. Police units, called ""blade runners"", have the job of destroying - or in their parlance ""retiring"" - any replicant that makes its way back to or created on Earth, with anyone convicted of aiding or assisting a replicant being sentenced to death. It's now November, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called out of retirement when four known replicants, most combat models, have made their way back to Earth, with their leader being Roy Batty. One, Leon Kowalski, tried to infiltrate his way into the Tyrell Corporation as an employee, but has since been able to escape. Beyond following Leon's trail in hopes of finding and retiring them all, Deckard believes part of what will help him is figuring out what the replicants wanted with the Tyrell Corporation in trying to infiltrate it. The answer may lie with Tyrell's fail-safe backup mechanism. Beyond tracking the four, Deckard faces a possible dilemma in encountering a fifth replicant: Rachael, who works as Tyrell's assistant. The issue is that Dr. Elden Tyrell is experimenting with her, to provide her with fake memories so as to be able to better control her. With those memories, Rachael has no idea that she is not human. The problem is not only Rachael's assistance to Deckard, but that he is beginning to develop feelings for her.—Huggo Los Angeles, California, 2019. With towering skyscrapers looming over the dystopian mega-city, grizzled bounty hunter Rick Deckard is called out of retirement when rogue Nexus-6 replicants steal a spaceship and enter Earth. The order is crystal-clear: Deckard must seek out the illegal replicants and destroy them before they locate their creator. However, as Deckard tries to fix the mistakes of those who want to play God, unprecedented, conflicting emotions cloud his judgement. Can uncertainty and empathy overshadow a Blade Runner's sense of duty?—Nick Riganas In the near future, the police department forces former blade runner Rick Deckard (Ford) out of retirement to hunt four genetically engineered humans who have escaped the colonies and returned to Earth. Designed to do difficult, hazardous work, the manufactured humans are stronger, faster and smarter than non-engineered humans. In a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to create replicants - humanoid androids with short, fixed lifespans - which are illegal on Earth, but are used in the off-world colonies. In Los Angeles, California, 2019, Deckard is a ""blade runner"", a cop who specializes in terminating replicants. He is forced to come out of retirement when four replicants escape from an off-world colony and come to Earth.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> A text crawl after the opening credits explains that in the near future, the technology that created synthetic humans has entered the 'Nexus phase': Replicants, sophisticated androids that are virtually identical to humans, are now superior in strength and at least equal in intelligence to their creators. Replicants are designed and built by the Tyrell Corporation, a giant multi-conglomerate headquartered in two pyramid-like towers. The latest and most advanced version of Replicant technology is the Nexus 6 model. Replicants are mostly used as slaves for manual labor on the ""Off-World Colonies"" out in space. Following a violent mutiny by Replicants on an Off-World Colony, the androids were outlawed on Earth. Specialized police units, ""Blade Runners"", are charged with the difficult task of detecting Replicants who illegally come to Earth. If found, Replicants are executed, which is not considered murder but euphemistically called ""retirement.""The opening title sets the story in Los Angeles in November, 2019. LA and the surrounding area have become heavily industrialized, crowded with people, and rain falls constantly. Apart from ground traffic, there are flying personal vehicles called 'spinners' soaring through the sky.At the Tyrell Corporation, a Blade Runner, Holden (Morgan Paull), is interviewing a new employee using a special device called a Voight-Kampff (VK) analyzer. The machine is designed to detect any physical responses in the test subject in response to questions that are deliberately meant to affect the subject emotionally. After a few questions, the man being tested, Leon Kowalski (Brion James), becomes obviously agitated and eventually hostile, shooting Holden.Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former Blade Runner, is eating on the street at a Japanese noodle bar when another man, Gaff (Edward James Olmos), tells him he's under arrest. Deckard tries to ignore the man but when he hears that a man called 'Bryant' is asking for him, he eventually agrees to come. Gaff flies Deckard by spinner to police headquarters and delivers Deckard to his old boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). Bryant tells Deckard that there are four ""skin jobs"" (the derogatory term for Replicants) loose on the streets, and he needs Deckard to retire them. Deckard suggests giving the job to Holden, but Bryant says they already did that: ""he can breathe okay, as long as nobody unplugs him."" Deckard is not interested and tries to leave, but Bryant successfully pressures him into accepting with a veiled threat.They watch footage of Leon's VK test as Bryant explains that six Nexus-6 Replicants murdered 23 people on an Off-World colony and then stole a shuttle to Earth. Two of them were killed three days before by a high-voltage security fence while trying to break into the Tyrell Corporation, the other four have survived and disappeared. Suspecting that they might try to infiltrate the Tyrell Corporation, Holden was tasked with testing their new employees, and nearly died after identifying one. Why the Replicants risked returning to the Tyrell Corporation remains a mystery. Bryant shows Deckard their files. The leader is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the most advanced and intelligent of the group. The others are Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), a trained Off-World assassin; Pris (Daryl Hannah), a 'pleasure model' (probably used for prostitution); and Leon, the Replicant who shot Holden. Bryant also tells Deckard that although the Nexus-6s are designed without emotions, they are believed to be advanced enough to develop these themselves within years, including hate and anger. As a fail-safe, the scientists designed the Nexus-6s to have only a four-year lifespan. Bryant sends Deckard to Tyrell Corp.'s headquarters to test the VK machine on one of their Nexus-6s, but Deckard wonders if their design might make them impossible to detect.Deckard and Gaff fly to Tyrell headquarters. While Deckard awaits Dr. Tyrell, he is welcomed by Rachael (Sean Young), a beautiful woman and Tyrell's personal assistant. Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) appears and questions Deckard about the Voight-Kampff test, doubting its ability to distinguish Replicants from humans. Tyrell offers Rachael as a test subject, saying he wants to see a negative test result on a human before providing a Replicant to be tested. Deckard asks Rachael over 100 test questions before the VK machine finally alerts him that she is a Replicant. Tyrell asks Rachael to leave. Deckard is surprised, because it usually takes 20 to 30 questions to identify a normal Replicant; Tyrell reveals that Rachael is unaware that she is one, although she may be beginning to suspect. He explains that Replicants may become emotionally unstable because of the short time they have to learn basic experiences. Rachael is an experimental Replicant who has been designed with implanted memories; the memories serve as a buffer for the emotions, which allows Replicants to better control their behavior.Deckard proceeds to the personal address that Leon gave in his VK test. In his apartment, he finds a stack of family photographs there, as well as a scale from an animal's hide. He is not aware that Leon is watching the police from a short distance. Not far away, Roy Batty is waiting on the street for Leon to return from his apartment. Leon appears and tells Roy that there were policemen there and he was unable to retrieve his photographs. Roy is perturbed but takes Leon with him to a shop called Eye World, owned by a Chinese man named Hannibal Chew (James Hong), who engineers Replicants' eyes for Tyrell. He is confronted in his subzero lab by Roy and Leon, the latter of whom rips open Chew's thermal coat to make it easier for Roy to interrogate him. Roy asks Chew about ""incept dates,"" the date marking a Replicant's first activation and beginning of their four year lifespan. Chew, quickly freezing to death, has no knowledge about that, and desperately tells them that they need to talk to Tyrell about increasing their lifespans. Roy suggests that meeting with Tyrell will be difficult, but Chew tells him that a Tyrell employee, J.F. Sebastian, may be able to gain Roy access.Deckard takes Leon's stack of photos home with him. He is surprised by Rachael in the elevator. Deckard, seemingly feeling caught off-guard, is quite rude to Rachael, who learned what Tyrell revealed to Deckard about her, but Tyrell refused to see her afterwards. She has come to debunk his claims, and shows Deckard a picture of herself with her mother. Deckard insensitively quashes Rachael's insistence that she has an actual past, giving her detailed descriptions of several of her 'childhood memories'. He tells her that these have been taken from other people, especially Tyrell's nieces. She is extremely hurt and starts crying, so Deckard fetches her a drink, but she has left by the time he is back.In another part of Los Angeles, near an old, neglected hotel called the Bradbury, a woman walks into an alley and covers herself with waste paper to keep warm. She dozes for a bit until a man approaches her and startles her awake. She runs away, breaking the window of his van, but the man kindly returns one of her bags and she becomes friendly. The woman is revealed to be Pris, one of the Nexus-6s Deckard is pursuing. The man is J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), a genetic designer for the Tyrell Corporation and the person Chew told Roy to find. Pris agrees to stay at Sebastian's hotel, where he lives alone and designs lifelike toys and dolls. Pris tells him that she is an orphan, but she has a few friends who may come over.In his apartment while drinking, Deckard examines his old photographs on his piano. In the Final Cut and Director's editions, he briefly dreams of a white unicorn. When he awakens, he analyzes one of Leon's photographs in a scanning device, and finds that a girl, probably Zhora, is visible in a back room. Deckard notes that she has a prominent tattoo in her neck of a looped serpent.Deckard visits the crowded streets near Chinatown and has a old Asian woman examine the animal scale. Deckard believes it to be from a fish but it's from a snake and, like most animals of the time period, is artificial. A serial number is also visible under the microscan; it identifies the maker as a man named Abdul Ben Hassan (Ben Astar), whose shop is right up the street. Deckard confronts Hassan, who tells him he has made a snake for a club owned by Taffey Lewis (Hy Pyke). Deckard goes to the club and unsuccessfully tries to pressure Lewis into identifying the girl in Leon's picture. He places a quick call to Rachael, apologizing for his insensitivity and asking her if she'd like to join him at the club. Rachel refuses, saying it is not her kind of place.Deckard finds that Zhora poses as an exotic dancer named Miss Salomé at the club, and she uses an artificial snake during her performances. After the show, Deckard poses as an irritating union representative, claiming to investigate abuses by club owners who may spy on female performers in their dressing rooms through peepholes drilled into the walls. Zhora sees through Deckard's ruse, beats him violently and is almost at the point of killing him, until she is disturbed by a few other dancers entering the room. She dashes from the club into the overcrowded streets, trying to hide in traffic. Deckard quickly catches up and chases her until he's able to shoot her. Zhora crashes through several plate glass windows and falls to the street, dead. Deckard identifies himself to the police that respond to the incident and when a passerby examines Zhora, they see the snake tattoo under her ear.Bryant arrives on the scene and talks to Deckard, congratulating him for finding and retiring Zhora. He tells Deckard that there are four more Replicants to retire; Deckard insists that there are only three left. Bryant tells him that Rachael has disappeared, so Deckard now has to retire her as well. Deckard leaves, and spots her a few moments later across the street. As he follows her, he's suddenly grabbed by Leon, who knocks his pistol away and beats him severely. When Leon says ""Wake up! Time to die!"", and is poised to stab his fingers through Deckard's eyes, his forehead explodes; he has been shot by Rachael using Deckard's own pistol. Deckard returns to his apartment and Rachael joins him.Rachael seems to have accepted the truth about herself, and Deckard appears to be much more sympathetic toward her since she saved him from Leon. He gives her a drink and as he cleans himself up, she asks him if he'd hunt her down, should she disappear to the north; he tells her he wouldn't, but someone else surely would. She asks if he knows more about her incept date and her lifespan, but Deckard says that he didn't look at them. Rachael asks him if he has ever tried the VK test on himself, but Deckard has fallen asleep on his couch. Rachael starts playing on his piano. Deckard wakes up, and the two play together. Rachael says she remembers piano lessons, but these memories are probably Tyrell's niece's, not hers. Deckard becomes more amorous, but Rachael gets insecure and rejects his advances. Deckard prevents her from leaving his apartment; she admits that she doesn't know how to make love, so Deckard 'instructs' her step by step, and they make love.Pris wakes up in Sebastian's apartment. She talks to her host about his strange skin condition, ""Methuselah syndrome,"" which makes him age quickly -- he is only 25, but his wrinkled skin makes him look much older. It is the reason why he can't leave Earth for an Off-World colony, but he doesn't mind. Suddenly, Roy appears, summoned there by Pris. He sadly shares the news that Zhora and Leon are both retired. Roy and Pris reveal to Sebastian that they are both Nexus-6s and they need his help. Pris proves to Sebastian that she's artificial by grabbing an egg from boiling water and tossing it to Sebastian, who finds it too hot to handle. They claim to have a similar disease as he does, accelerated aging; Pris will need help, or she'll die. Sebastian says that he only does genetic design, but Roy notices that Sebastian plays chess and asks him about his opponent, who is Tyrell himself. Roy gently coerces Sebastian to use his connection to Tyrell to arrange a personal meeting. Sebastian reluctantly agrees.Roy and Sebastian go to Tyrell's pyramidal home and take an elevator to his penthouse. They are stopped as a security measure, but are allowed to proceed when Sebastian voices two moves to Tyrell himself that win the chess match they'd been playing; the last move is given to him by Roy. Tyrell is fascinated by the bold move, and invites Sebastian in. In Tyrell's bedchamber, Sebastian introduces Roy, but Tyrell seems to have been expecting Roy for some time. Roy confronts his creator, saying specifically that he wants an extension of his short lifespan, and calls Tyrell ""father."" (In the 1982 Theatrical and 1992 Director's editions, Roy says ""fucker"" in place of father.) Tyrell explains that he is unable to do that; once an artificial being like Roy has been completed, it is impossible to make any alterations in its lifecycle. Roy proposes several biological interventions to prolong his lifespan, but Tyrell dismisses all of them as ineffective, saying that they have made him as well they could, though not to last. Roy becomes despondent, but Tyrell comforts him, saying that ""the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and you have burned so very very brightly"". Roy tells Tyrell he's done ""questionable things"", but Tyrell's pride seems too big for him to care, focusing on the extraordinary things Roy has done. Roy, still despondent, first kisses Tyrell, then begins to crush his skull, poking his thumbs through his creator's eyes. Tyrell falls dead, as the horrified Sebastian watches. Roy then goes after Sebastian as well.Deckard is in his car on the streets, moving it when some street people climb on the back, apparently hoping to scavenge parts they can sell. He receives a report from Bryant, who tells him that Tyrell is dead and Sebastian has been found dead at the same scene. Deckard places a call to Sebastian's apartment, claiming to be a friend. Pris answers the call but hangs up without a word. Deckard drives to Sebastian's apartment and searches for evidence or leads. As Deckard searches the cluttered mess of puppets and mannequins, he is surprised by a disguised Pris, who assaults him using acrobatics. As she performs a series of back flips to finish Deckard off, he shoots her through the abdomen. She spasms violently for a few moments before Deckard shoots her twice more and finally kills her.Deckard hears Roy arrive, and takes up position in a nearby room. Roy comes in and finds Pris dead. He weeps and and kisses her lifeless lips. He enters the next room; Deckard shoots at him but misses. Roy chides him that he's ""not being very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent."" A game of cat-and-mouse starts, with Roy stalking Deckard throughout the apartment. At one point, he seizes Deckard's hand through a wall and deliberately breaks two of his fingers, in retaliation for Zhora and Pris. He gives him the gun back and releases his hand, but Deckard finds it impossible to shoot straight with two broken fingers. Roy gives him a few seconds head-start to flee. Deckard escapes to an upper floor in the building, but is easily found by Roy when he howls in pain from trying to reset his fingers. Deckard keeps moving, but is in great pain and drops his gun. Roy is already showing signs of his own impending death -- he stabs himself through the hand with a large nail to temporarily stabilize his condition. Deckard seizes an opportunity to beat Roy with a large pipe but he cannot incapacitate Roy, whose superhuman strength is too much for Deckard. Deckard eventually escapes onto a window ledge and climbs to the roof, but Roy appears moments later, holding a white dove he found on the roof. Deckard tries to escape by jumping to another roof across the street, but barely makes it to the ledge. He nearly plummets, hanging on by one hand. Roy makes the jump quite easily and peers over the ledge at Deckard, saying ""Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave"". Deckard slips and Roy catches his arm with one hand, pulling him up to safety. Roy sits down near him, and tells Deckard that he's seen more in his short life than most humans would see in a full lifetime. Roy is saddened by the idea that all the memories he's acquired will be lost ""like tears in rain."" Then, echoing the last thing Leon said to Deckard, Roy says ""time to die"" -- but he's referring to himself. As he finally dies, the dove in his hand flies off. In the Final Cut (2007), the rain continues and the dove flies toward an overcast sky.In the original theatrical version (1982), the rain has stopped and the dove flies toward a clear blue sky. Deckard muses that he doesn't know why Roy saved him; perhaps he had a newfound love for life, including Deckard's. He notes that the Replicants only wanted the same answers that humans do about life: where do we come from and how long it lasts.Gaff meets Deckard on the roof and throws his pistol back to him. He congratulates Deckard on completing his investigation; Deckard tells him he's officially finished with hunting Replicants. As Gaff walks away, he looks back over his shoulder, and yells, ""It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?"", referring to Rachael.Deckard returns to his apartment and is alarmed to find the door ajar. He takes out his gun and calls Rachael. When she doesn't answer he walks through the rooms with his gun drawn. In the bedroom, Rachael is completely covered by the bed linens. He fears that she is dead. Much to his relief, she wakes up when he pulls the sheet back and touches her. He asks her whether she loves and trusts him; she replies that she does. A few minutes later, she is dressed and Deckard, after checking the lobby outside his apartment, motions for her to join him in the elevator. On the floor of the lobby is a small origami unicorn, left there by Gaff. Gaff's words about Rachael not living echo in Deckard's head. He realizes that Gaff was there but let Rachael live. Deckard studies the unicorn for a moment, then crushes it in his hand. In the Final Cut and Director's (1992) editions, the film ends when the elevator doors close.In the Theatrical edition, Deckard and Rachael drive into a sun-lit and mountainous area, and Deckard explains in voice-over that Tyrell told him that Rachael was special, and has no termination date. Echoing Gaff's sentiment atop the roof, he muses, ""I didn't know how long we had together... who does?"""
Young Doctors in Love,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084938/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a zany parody of hospital soap operas, a new batch of doctors begins their internship at City Hospital. An 'Airplane'-style spoof of hospital soap operas: a brilliant young trainee can't stand the sight of blood; a doctor romances the head nurse in order to get the key to the drugs cabinet; there's a mafioso on the loose disguised as a woman - in other words all the usual ingredients present and correct, though in this case the laughs are intentional.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> Beginning their one-year residency to become doctors, a group of young medical interns - psychiatrist Dr. Walter Rist (Patrick Collins), gynecologist Dr. Thurman Flicker (Rick Overton), anesthesiologist Dr. Charles Litto (Kyle T. Heffner), pediatrician Dr. Milton Chamberlain (Gary Friedkin), sports medicine Dr. Bucky DeVol (Ted McGinley), and overtired, student loan debt-ridden allergist Dr. Phil Burns (Taylor Negron) - introduce themselves to the intimidating City Hospital administrator, Dr. Joseph Prang (Dabney Coleman). Also among the students are the virtuous Dr. Stephanie Brody (Sean Young) from a small town in Vermont, and the arrogant yet determined Dr. Simon August (Michael McKean) from Beverly Hills, California, who intends to become ""the greatest surgeon the world has ever known."" When reporting for their first shift just after midnight on New Year's Day, they find the lobby and emergency room areas in a state of chaos.Meanwhile, organized crime lord Salvatore ""Sal"" Bonafetti (Titos Vandis) hides in a safe house with his son, Angelo Bonafetti (Hector Elizondo), to protect himself from rumored assassination attempts by rival Mafia families. When Sal suffers from a stress-induced stroke, Angelo dresses himself and his father in disguises before taking him to the hospital, where they are pursued by an assassin named Malamud (Michael Richards).While watching Simon curtly diagnose patients, Stephanie instantly disapproves of his insensitive bedside manner.Later that morning, Malamud finds Sal's room, but the nurses mistake him for a patient and force him into the neighboring bed, worsening Sal's paralyzing anxiety.During a training lesson, Simon's astuteness enrages their supervisor, Dr. Oliver Wendell Ludwig (Harry Dean Stanton), but impresses Stephanie, who asks him on a date. During dinner that night, Stephanie tells Simon about her hometown community, which funded her medical school education so she could take over her ailing father's practice. Simon discredits her humble background, causing her to become angry. When she stands up to leave, however, she doubles over in fleeting abdominal pain, destroying the restaurant's outdoor patio tent.At the hospital the next day, the nurses find a patient file belonging to another ""Malamud"" and erroneously prepare the assassin for surgery to remove one of his kidneys.While observing a patient, Simon expresses his interest in continuing his relationship with Stephanie, but they agree to remain professional.After receiving a raunchy prank love letter from someone he believes was the uptight Nurse Norine Sprockett (Pamela Reed), Phil Burns flirts with her in order to gain access to stimulant medications from the locked prescription cabinet.Angelo continues visiting his father Sal in the hospital while dressed as a woman named ""Angela.""On Valentine's Day, Simon runs into Stephanie teaching a community dance class, and confronts her about her suddenly cold attitude toward him, hoping to make amends. When Stephanie once again collapses in pain, Simon tricks her into collecting a saliva sample, which he sends to Dr. Ludwig to run tests for a rare and fatal disease. Impressed with Simon's intelligence and attitude, Dr. Prang invites him to prove his surgical capabilities by performing an appendix removal.One day, a man code-named ""Vanilla"" asks to buy medication from Phil, prompting the doctor to continue courting Nurse Sprockett, who has transformed her appearance to make herself more attractive.Skipping forward several months later in July, Malamud complains about the many unnecessary procedures he has been forced to undergo over his seven month confinement in Sal's room.The interns watch as Simon begins his surgical test, but the pressure causes him to recall a traumatic experience from childhood, in which his parents played a practical joke on him during a mock ""surgery"" on a piñata. Overwhelmed by the pressure, Simon runs out of the room and retreats to a nearby cemetery to contemplate his future. Offering to help restore his confidence, Stephanie brings him back to the now-empty surgical theater, where they make love on the operating table.Dr. Ludwig announces that Stephanie's test results came back ""negative,"" lying about having tested her for the specific disease.Meanwhile, Angelo's wife becomes concerned by the increasing amount of time he is spending at the hospital with the compassionate Dr. Walter Rist, who is unaware that ""Angela"" is actually a man.Another few months later in December near Christmas, Walter invites ""Angela"" to a holiday party at Dr. Prang's house, where Stephanie announces she is willing to give up her dream of returning to Vermont in order to get married and live with Simon in Beverly Hills. However, Stephanie collapses, and Dr. Ludwig reveals that she really has the condition Simon suspected, which is only curable through dangerous surgery. Dr. Prang is the lone surgeon to ever successfully perform the procedure, but he refuses to do it again until Simon persuades him by punching him in the face.Having secretly made a copy of Nurse Sprockett's medicine cabinet key, Phil now steals prescriptions at his leisure, but she eventually discovers his deception when he and ""Vanilla"" are arrested by undercover police officers.Dr. Prang practices the surgery on a mannequin in order to prepare for Stephanie's operation, but just before the procedure, the hospital nurses go on strike over a wages dispute, and Dr. Prang learns that his recent divorce proceedings have left him bankrupt. Ignoring his summons to the operating room, Dr. Prang chases his accountant at gunpoint throughout the halls of the hospital, forcing Simon to assume responsibility for Stephanie's life. Although he has the assistance of Dr. Ludwig and some of the other interns, Simon believes Stephanie's body has rejected the treatment, and he sulks out of the room. Once gone, the remaining doctors realize that the equipment was unplugged, and Stephanie revives. The interns wheel her on a gurney after Simon, and the two lovers kiss.After her recovery, Simon and Stephanie get married in the hospital hallway.When his father is ready to be discharged, Angelo writes Walter a letter stating that, despite the doctor's attraction to ""Angela,"" they cannot be together because he is already married. Walter then begins a relationship with Nurse Sprockett."

Can Ted Striker save the day and get the shuttle back on track - again? Still haunted by that fateful wartime incident and the nearly catastrophic events ofAirplane! (1980), Ted Striker, the ex-fighter pilot who hates flying, escapes from the mental asylum. But as the first passenger space shuttle, the state-of-the-art but untested Mayflower One, is about to take off on its maiden flight, once more, an unforeseen malfunction forces Ted to take over the controls of the shuttle. Now, the traumatized commander is holding everyone's lives in his hands, and as if that weren't enough, Striker has to patch up his already complicated relationship with his engaged former lover, Elaine Dickinson, and confront an unhinged voyager bent on destruction. Can Ted Striker, the reluctant hero, save the day for the second time?—Nick Riganas Years have passed since Ted Striker heroically saved many lives by avoiding a plane crash. Working as a test pilot for a new Lunar Shuttle, he gets innocently sent into a mental ward after a crash of the badly constructed, computer-navigated spaceship. When he hears that the exactly same type of shuttle is scheduled for a moon flight soon, he breaks out to hinder the launch. Aboard, Ted finds his ex Elaine Dickinson working as stewardess again and her fiancé Simon, a member of the committee that wants the Mayflower I to be launched. In flight, the ship's computer ROK 9000 takes control.

When Ted learns of the lunar shuttle's upcoming launch, he escapes from the asylum and buys a ticket for the flight.During the flight, Mayflower One suffers a short circuit, causing the artificially intelligent computer, ROK 4000, to go insane and send the shuttle toward the Sun.

On the way to the moon, flight control shifts to a lunar base under the command of Commander Buck Murdock (William Shatner). Contemptuous of Ted because of Macho Grande, he nonetheless agrees to help and they manage to land the shuttle safely on the Moon.

And then, there's Stacy's carefree surfer classmate Jeff Spicoli, who lives for the moment and takes great pleasure in pushing strict history teacher Mr Hand's buttons. However, time and life wait for no one. Who knows what tomorrow holds?—Nick Riganas Stacy Hamilton (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a 15-year-old high school sophomore who works in the Ridgemont Mall at Perry's pizza parlor with the seemingly more sexually experienced Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates). Mark ""Rat"" Ratner (Brian Backer) also a sophomore, works in the mall as ""assistant to the assistant manager"" at the movie theater. His friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus), who also hangs out at the mall scalping rock concert tickets, believes himself to be both worldly and wise in the ways of women.Stacy's brother Brad (Judge Reinhold) is a semi-dorky senior but is relatively popular because he has his own car and is a low-grade supervisor at All-American Burger, a favorite after-school hang-out and a place that treats teen employees well. Brad is spending his final year in high school basking in the joy of becoming the unfettered owner of his blue 1960 Buick LeSabre (""the cruising vessel""), which has only six payments left, and obsessing over the best way to ease out of the long-time relationship with his girlfriend, Lisa (Amanda Wyss), who also works at All-American Burger.Surfer-type Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) is the resident stoner who begins the new school year tumbling out of a Volkswagen Microbus after hot-boxing in the parking lot as the final attendance bell rings. Spicoli tries to come into the stern Mr. Hand's (Ray Walston) history class after the final bell, but Mr. Hand has locked the door. Spicoli knocks on the door but when Mr Hand sends him to principal's office, Spicoli calls him a ""dick,"" thus beginning a vendetta between Mr. Hand and Spicoli that lasts throughout the movie.The sexually curious Stacy initially hooks up with a much older home stereo salesman, Ron Johnson of Pacific Stereo in the mall. He provides her first sexual experiences. He dumps her a few months later, causing Stacy to wonder what was wrong with herself and seek other relationships.In addition to his brief encounters with Stacy at the pizza parlor during his breaks at the movie theater, nerdy Mark Ratner ends up with Stacy as his lab partner in biology class. Ratner receives pointers from his friend Damone, the scalper. With prodding from Damone, ""Rat"" goes over to the pizza parlor one evening and asks for Stacy's phone number, saying he'll call her to ask her out on a date. Embarassed, but flattered, Stacy accepts Mark's offer of a date.The date goes well despite Mark forgetting his wallet at home and the tape deck being stolen from his sister's car during their dinner at a local German restaurant. They go back to her house, where she comes on to him. Inexperienced with sex, he chickens out, leaving her there with nothing but a robe on. This leads Stacy to confide in Linda that she believes (mistakenly) that Mark does not love her.Back at school, Spicoli continues to annoy Mr. Hand, including one episode in which Spicoli arranges for a pizza delivery in the middle of class by a less-than-thrilled ""Pizza Guy"" delivery man (Taylor Negron) only to have Mr. Hand take the pizza away and distribute it to his favored students.Meanwhile, Brad loses his cherished job at All American Burger one day in a dispute with an unsatisfied and rude customer (Sonny Carl Davis) who demands his money back (clearly a yuppie con artist), where after the rude customer insults Brad and Brad insults the rude customer back, the stern boss, Dennis, approaches and instantly fires Brad for it and falls for the con artist's ploy and refunds his money. Brad feels betrayed when all of his co-worker friends don't have the courage to stand up for him to their dictator of a boss out of fear of losing their jobs too. As a result, Brad never speaks to any of his friends ever again. Brad is forced to take a new job at ""Captain Hook Fish and Chips,"" a Long John Silvers-styled fish restaurant. Employees are forced to wear pirate uniforms, and after being laughed at by a beautiful woman (Nancy Wilson) while on a delivery, Brad quits in disgust while tossing all the ""Catch of the Day"" boxes out into the street.At a pep rally before the football game with Lincoln High, Brad meets up with his girlfriend Lisa. In a complete turnabout from his plans to go solo during the summer, Brad bares his troubled soul to Lisa, telling her that he needs her now more than ever. But Lisa dumps him, saying she wants to see other people before she heads to college, the perfect culmination to Brad's personal annihilation.As Brad's life crumbles as he now has no friends or job, Stacy and Linda are sitting by the pool discussing men. Meanwhile, Damone convinces Mark to give it another shot with Stacy. Damone leads Mark to Stacy's house, where Damone crashes the girl chat. Brad comes home, dejected, and goes into the house. The teens all comment on how Brad is so depressed after losing his job at All America Burger. Brad heads for the bathroom and starts to masturbate as he fantasizes about Linda approaching him in her bikini and undoing her top (in a now near-legendary scene set to The Cars' song ""Moving in Stereo""). Linda jumps into the pool and gets water in her ear. She makes her way to the bathroom for a Q-tip and is shocked as she catches Brad masturbating, which ruins the pool party.Later that evening, Spicoli is seen drinking beer, smoking marijuana, and lost in his own world as he joyrides in a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 owned by Charles Jefferson (Forest Whitaker), an ill-tempered, hulking jock who is the star of the Ridgemont football team. The car is a gift from a grateful alumnus, and Jefferson's little brother, along for the ride, freaks out as an unconcerned Spicoli drives like a maniac through the crowded city streets. Spicoli eventually wrecks the car when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car, and crashes into a concrete wall. Spicoli promises to Jefferson's brother that he can fix it.The next day at school, a large crowd gathers around the front entrance--where Jefferson's totaled car is covered in anti-Ridgemont graffiti. Spicoli has apparently made it look as if the rival high school, Lincoln High, destroyed it as a prank. Jefferson takes out his anger on the Lincoln football team that night, winning the game single handily and sending Lincoln's quarterback out of the game on a stretcher.Over the next several weeks, Stacy grows attracted to Mark's friend, Damone. Stacy meets Damone after school and Damone drives her home. Damone asks if Stacy has any iced tea and then he wants to go for a swim. She brings him into the changing booth near the pool. Instead of swimming, the two have clumsy, unsatisfying sex in the changing booth.Later, Stacy tells Linda that she is pregnant. Stacy tells Damone and they decide that an abortion is the only solution. She asks Damone to pay for half the abortion ($150) and give her a ride to the clinic. Damone agrees. A little later, Damone and Ratner get into an argument over Stacy in the locker room after Ratner hears that Damone has been with Stacy. After Damone and Ratner almost get into a fistfight, they cut ties with each other.Damone has a hard time coming up with his half of the money to pay for the abortion. Damone desperately and unsuccessfully attempts to collect from past ""clients"" who owe him money. It is only then that Damone finally discovers how little power and popularity he has with the other teens. Ashamed, Damone does not show up to drive Stacy to the clinic and avoids her phone calls. Stacy catches a ride with Brad to a nearby bowling alley under the pretense that she is meeting some friends there. Brad sees Stacy leave the bowling alley and enter the clinic. After the procedure is finished, Brad is waiting for Stacy outside and talks to her about what happened, though Stacy will not tell him the identity of the father. Stacy's sibling bond grows with Brad when he shows a brotherly act of kindness by not pressing the issue. Linda, however, is not so charitable. After Stacy tells her of Damone's deception, Linda goes after Damone by scrawling ""Prick"" in spray paint on his car door and ""Little Prick"" in marker on his school locker.Another month or two later, Stacy and Mark are fated to be together again when they go on a biology class field trip to observe an autopsy performed by their flaky biology teacher Mr. Vargas (Vincent Schiavelli). Spicoli tags along with the class (despite that he does not take biology) just for the excursion. When Mr. Vargas starts to rip organs from the corpse, Stacy feels sick and Mark helps her out of the procedure room. Stacy is grateful to Mark for staying with her and says he's ""a nice guy.""School is coming to an end. Mr. Hand takes some revenge on Spicoli by visiting him at his home on the night of the graduation dance and administering an impromptu American History lesson long enough to delay Spicoli until well after the prom has started. Surprisingly, Spicoli does well with Mr. Hand's questioning and the two are actually amiable by the end of the session. Still, the teacher relents on the question of whether or not he will flunk Spicoli, telling the stoned surfer he'll probably ""squeak by.""Mike Damone and Mark Ratner speak to each other at the prom. A tenuous bond is reformed, but Damone knows he no longer has power over ""Rat.""In the closing scenes, Stacy, still working at the pizza joint, sees Mark at his station across the mall at the theater. She waves him over and gives him a demure photo of herself. She makes it clear she'd like to begin seeing him again. Mark is at first tentative, but Stacy playfully nudges Mark and eggs him on. He looks at Stacy for a moment, smiles and then says he'll call her.Meanwhile, Brad is working at his new job, the bottom rung on the high school scale of after-school employment: a convenience store called Mi-T-Mart. Spicoli walks in and tries to make a purchase while fumbling with pocket change. He then asks to use the bathroom. As soon as Spicoli walks away to the restroom, a car pulls up to the front of the store, a robber exits the car, walks in the door, sprays the security camera, pulls out a pistol and tells Brad to give him all the money in the wall safe. Brad gets very nervous, and cannot open the safe. But when the armed robber threatens to shoot and kill Brad for stalling, Brad's fear suddenly turns into anger as he mouths off to the armed robber, wishing that he would just die.... as Brad sees this as just another rotten episode in his further disintegrating life. Just then Spicoli walks out of the bathroom complaining that there are no paper towels and he inadvertently distracts the thief for a few seconds, just long enough for a furious Brad to grab and throw a pot of hot coffee in the robber's face, jump over the counter, take his gun away and captures the would-be thief as the criminal's getaway car peels out the parking lot, making Brad a local hero... at least in Spicoli's eyes.Before the end credits roll, the characters' futures are shown:Brad Hamilton: Made manager of Mi-T-Mart, June 12.Mike Damone: Busted for scalping Ozzy Osbourne tickets.

Night Shift,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084412/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mild-mannered morgue attendant is assigned to the night shift, and his new coworker, along with his prostitute neighbor, convince him of running a prostitution ring out of the morgue. A nebbish of a morgue attendant gets shunted back to the night shift where he is shackled with an obnoxious neophyte partner who dreams of the ""one great idea"" for success. His life takes a bizarre turn when a prostitute neighbour complains about the loss of her pimp. His partner, upon hearing the situation, suggests that they fill that opening themselves using the morgue at night as their brothel. Against his better judgement, he gets talked into the idea, only to find that it's more than his boss that has objections to this bit of entrepreneurship.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> Chuck Lumley is a nice, unassuming man. His fear of life is the primary reason he took a job as a morgue attendant rather than stay in his previous high stress job on Wall Street, despite having a natural aptitude in finance and business. He is dismayed to learn that he has been reassigned to the night shift at the morgue, if only because it will take away time available to spend with his straight-laced but neurotic fiancée, Charlotte Koogle. He is even more dismayed when he meets his new night shift colleague, William Blazejowski - who calls himself Billy Blaze - a manic, non-stop talking man, who is always trying to come up with get rich quick schemes, which are mostly hair-brained ideas. After Chuck befriends his neighbor, a good-natured hooker named Belinda Keaton, he learns that Belinda's former pimp was murdered, leaving her and many of her hooker friends pimp-less and thus unprotected by the unpredictability of their johns. From this knowledge, Billy sprouts the latest germ of a scheme: that he and Chuck, in their unsupervised state, should act as pimps - or what Billy calls love brokers - for Belinda and her friends during their night shift at the morgue. Chuck eventually agrees, if only because of his affection for Belinda, but he expands on that idea into a full-fledged pseudo-legitimate business for all their collective benefit. The questions become if this business is sustainable in light of the fact of everything about it being against Chuck's general nature, and if he will be able to balance his growing feelings for Belinda against having a personal relationship with a hooker.—Huggo The movie opens with pimp Franklin (Julius LeFlore) being chased through the New York City night by gangsters Cleon (Badja Djola) and Pig (Richard Belzer). They catch him and punish him for not giving them a cut of his prostitution profits by dropping him out a high-rise window. As the body is transported to the New York City morgue by hearse, the credits roll.The next day one of Frankin's girls, Belinda (Shelley Long) identifies his body as morgue attendant Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) looks on. Belinda remarks that the loss of Frankin will be hard on his girls, then notes that Chuck looks familiar. Chuck is embarrassed as he is afraid the detective taking Belinda's statement may think that he is one of her customers.That evening as he is going home Chuck is told by his boss (Floyd Levine) that he is being moved to the night shift to make room for the boss's nephew. Chuck, being an introverted milk-toast, puts up no protest, though it is clear that he is annoyed. Chuck's neurotic, diet-obsessed, fiance, Charlotte (Gina Hecht) tells him that he should be more aggressive and speak up for himself.,Chuck starts his first night shift and has to train a new partner: Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton). Bill is an irrepressible character who talks constantly and thinks of himself as an idea man. He is continually making notes to himself on his portable tape recorder, though most of his ideas are silly or impractical. He repeatedly tries to comes up with schemes to make money such as chauffeuring college boy Jeffrey (Clint Howard) on a prom date using a hearse as a limo.Chuck invites Charlotte over to spend the evening with him on his one night off, but she is unable to get in the mood for love because of a country-western song being played loudly in the next apartment. Chuck knocks at the door to ask them to turn it down and is confronted by a large, muscular man in a cowboy hat. He is rescued from being beaten up when the owner of the apartment, which turns out to be Belinda, intervenes (Cowboy hat is a client). Chuck realizes that Belinda thought he looked familiar because they had passed each other in the hall. Though all ends peacefully, by the time the incident is over Charlotte decides to head home leaving Chuck frustrated.Chuck comes home one evening to find Belinda injured on the floor of the elevator, struck by a client who did not want to pay. She notes this would not have happened if she had a pimp to watch out for her, but finding a good one is difficult. He helps Belinda back to her apartment, but not before he is mistaken as her attacker by a troop of Bluebirds (girl scouts). Lead by a young girl with a whistle (Shannen Doherty) they surround him and beat him on the head with their boxes of cookies.On the way to work the next day Chuck confides to Bill about Belinda, and her colleagues, continuing need for a pimp. Bill suggests that they should do it (becoming ""Love Brokers"") and run it out of the morgue. At first Chuck dismisses this, but when he gets back to his apartment that morning, Belinda knocks on his door and suggests they have breakfast together. While Chuck is on the phone with Charlotte, he watches Belinda prepare them eggs in his kitchen. As the kitchen is hot, she decides to take off her robe. Chuck forgets completely about Charlotte hanging up the phone on her as he is totally absorbed watching Belinda fry eggs wearing nothing but a baby-doll top and a pair of bikini panties.Chuck, trying to find some way to get in her favor mentions Bill's idea of them working a ""love brokers"" for Belinda and the other girls. She is pleased at the idea.At first the operation works well, with Chuck and Bill only taking 10 percent of girls money (as opposed to the 90% often taken by pimps). Chuck also uses his financial skills (he worked on Wall Street until he found the job too competitive and stressful) to get the girls invested in a business. The only problem comes one night when things get out of control when Bill uses the morgue to allow some college fraternity members (one portrayed by a youngKevin Costner) to party with the girls.Bill, Chuck and the girls celebrate their success at an end-of-the-year party. Afterward Chuck takes Belinda home and as they are saying goodnight, they wind up kissing, and then making love. The next evening Chuck comes to work late, but very happy. He tells Bill he can expect that Belinda will not be taking any more jobs and is stunned when she shows up for an evening of work. They argue and we get the feeling that Belinda would give up her work if Chuck was willing to tell her he loved her (which he is too wimpy to do). Bill takes Belinda to her evenings assignment while Chuck sits back at the morgue and broods.When Belinda and Bill arrive at the location where she is to meet the client she is crying and Bill offers to take her home and find some way to placate the customer. She agrees.Back at the morgue, Cleon and Pig have shown up and are very angry at not getting a cut of Bill and Chuck's operation. They strap Chuck to a lab table and are about to kill him by putting a fire hose down his throat and turning it on when Bill arrives back at the morgue with two men he thinks are potential customers. They are really vice cops and a gunfight breaks out between them and the gangsters with bullets flying all around a helpless Chuck.The cops eventually win the battle, but Bill and Chuck's operation has been exposed and they wind up in jail. Charlotte appears and at first Chuck is elated thinking that she has come to standby him, only to have her spit on him and tell him she never wants to see him again.The girls bail Bill and Chuck out. At their lawyer's office they are told that the city administration, embarrassed by the incident, will give them their old jobs back so they can sweep everything under the rug. Chuck is ecstatic at this, but is angered by Bill's intention to try and use the incident to get money out of the city in blackmail. Chuck angrily tells Bill he wants his own life to the way it was before they met.A few days later Chuck and Belinda meet outside their apartments. He tells her he is back at his old job and she tells him she is starting a new job (but doing the same thing) at an upscale pleasure club called Paradise Found. She also tells him this is goodbye as she is moving out of her apartment at the end of the week.As she leaves for work Chuck is approached by a surly deliveryman (Vincent Schiavelli) with his dinner. When Chuck complains that he did not order mustard on his sandwich, the deliveryman takes the bread off the top and wipes the mustard down Chuck's doorpost, then puts the sandwich back together. This is the final straw and Chuck loses it demanding another sandwich and cowing the deliveryman, though he is physically much bigger.This makes Chuck realize that the only way he is going to get the things that he wants in life is to stand up for himself. He decides he wants Belinda and runs across town to the nightclub and brothel named Paradise Found. Bullying his way past the doorman he searches the club for Belinda. He runs into Bill who is now working there as a somewhat incompetent towel boy. Chuck finally spots Belinda reluctantly talking to a customer (Jim Staahl). Chuck rushes to her, telling her he needs to speak to her about something. This annoys the customer who pushes Chuck to the floor. Seeing his friend in trouble, Bill tries to leap on the customer from the second floor balcony and misses, hitting the floor. The customer leaves to complain the manager, Mr. Manetti (Joe Spinell). After checking to see that Bill is okay, Chuck works up the nerve to tell Belinda he loves her. When Manetti arrives on the scene, he berates and threatens Bill and Belinda. Chuck confronts Manetti, telling him he cannot do this to his friends and pushes the manager into the club's pool. The three friends then run from club into the New York night. As the credits role we realize that Belinda and Chuck will be starting a new life together."
Pink Floyd: The Wall,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A confined but troubled rock star descends into madness in the midst of his physical and social isolation from everyone. Rock star Pink Floyd is a tortured soul. Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.—Huggo When his wife leaves him during a tour, the rock star Pink Floyd (Bob Geldof) becomes paranoid and mad, building a wall between the world in his mind and the real world. The process has begun during his childhood and loses his father in the war, missing him as a role model. His overprotective mother and the repressive education at school help to build the insanity process. Pink brings a willing groupie back to his hotel room, only to destroy it in a violent anger once she annoys him, scaring her away. Soon he suddenly regrets building the wall and becomes a violent fascist dictator, and his soldiers proceed to attack people. He then screams stop and goes on trial in his mind for what he has done, and then he finally tears down the wall as penalty.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film depicts the construction and ultimate demolition of a metaphorical wall. Though the film's symbolism is open to interpretation, the wall itself clearly reflects a sense of isolation and alienation.The protagonist (and unreliable narrator) of the film, Pink (Bob Geldof) is a rock star, one of several reasons behind his apparent depressive and detached emotional state. He is first seen in a quiet hotel room, having trashed it. The opening music is not by Pink Floyd, but is the Vera Lynn recording of ""The Little Boy that Santa Claus Forgot"". During the following scenes, it is revealed that Pink's father, a British soldier, was killed in action during World War II during Pink's infancy. The reference is almost certainly to the death of Roger Waters' real-life father, Eric Fletcher Waters, who died in combat in Italy during Operation Shingle (the Battle of Anzio) in February 1944. (""When the Tigers Broke Free, Part I""). The stampede of a modern rock concert is compared to soldiers running out of the foxholes to engage in combat (""In the Flesh?"")The movie then flashes back to Pink as a young English boy growing up in the early 1950s. Pink longs for a father figure (""Another Brick in the Wall, Part I""). He discovers a scroll from ""kind old King George"" and other relics from his father's military service and death (""When the Tigers Broke Free, Part II""). One item he finds, a bullet, is placed on the track of an oncoming train, where he sees non-descript people riding the train. At school, he is caught writing poems in class and humiliated by the teacher who reads a poem (part of verse 2 of the song ""Money""). It is revealed that the teacher is verbally abusive to the students because his wife is verbally abusive to him (""The Happiest Days of Our Lives""). Young Pink imagines a surrealistically oppressive school system in which children fall into a meat grinder. The children then rise in rebellion and destroy the school, carrying the teacher away to an unknown fate (""Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)""). Pink is also negatively affected by his overprotective mother (""Mother""). Such traumatic experiences are represented as ""bricks"" in the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from society (""Empty Spaces"").As an adult, Pink eventually marries, but he and his wife soon grow apart. While he is in the United States on tour, Pink learns that his wife is having an affair (""Young Lust""). He turns to a willing groupie (Jenny Wright), whom he brings back to his hotel room only to trash it in a violent anger, terrifying the groupie out of the room (""One of My Turns""). After she leaves screaming, Pink goes into a deep depression (""Don't Leave Me Now""). After smashing the television with his guitar, he vows that he doesn't need ""anyone at all"" (""Another Brick in the Wall, Part III""). With that, he mentally completes the wall that he started building to protect himself from being hurt (""Goodbye Cruel World"").Pink slowly begins to lose his mind to metaphorical ""worms"". He shaves off all of his body hair (an incident inspired by former bandmate Syd Barrett, who appeared at a 1975 recording session of ""Wish You Were Here"", having shaved his eyebrows and body hair) and, while watching The Dam Busters (1955) on television, morphs into his neo-Nazi alter-ego. Pink's manager (Bob Hoskins), along with the hotel manager (Michael Ensign) and some paramedics, break into the hotel room and discover Pink. They take him away into a waiting limousine outside the hotel and inject him with drugs to enable him to perform (""Comfortably Numb"").Pink fantasizes that he is a dictator and his concert is a neo-Nazi rally. Nazi-Pink holds a rally, and looks for people who are different, ""queers"", ""coons"", dopers, and orders them ""against the wall"". (""In the Flesh""). His followers proceed to attack ethnic minorities (""Run Like Hell""), and Pink holds a rally in suburban London (""Waiting for the Worms""). The scene is intercut with images of animated marching hammers that goose-step across ruins. Pink then stops hallucinating and screams ""Stop!"" and takes refuge in a bathroom stall at the concert venue, reciting poems which would later be used as lyrics on Pink Floyd's ""Your Possible Pasts"" from ""The Final Cut"" album and ""5:11 AM (The Moment of Clarity)"" from Roger Waters' album ""The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking"".In a climatic animated sequence, Pink puts himself on trial (""The Trial""). He is depicted as a small pink rag doll that rarely moves. The judge is a giant pair of buttocks, with two backward facing legs, an anus for a mouth and a scrotum for a chin. The lawyer is a tall, menacing, vulture-like man and the schoolmaster is an abusive, hateful marionette. After hearing from the parties and witnesses (Pink's wife and mother), the judge orders the wall to be torn down. Following a prolonged silence, the wall explodes and shows a montage of events from the entire film, and Pink is last heard screaming. The film concludes with three children cleaning up a pile of debris after an earlier riot (""Outside the Wall""). It is unknown whatever has happened to Pink, leaving the viewer to decide."
Victor/Victoria,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084865/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A struggling female soprano finds work playing a male female impersonator, but it complicates her personal life. In 1934 Paris, trained coloratura soprano Victoria Grant (Dame Julie Andrews), a native Brit, can't get a job as a singer and is having trouble making ends meet. She doesn't even have enough money for the basics of food and shelter. Gay cabaret singer Carole ""Toddy"" Todd (Robert Preston) may befall the same fate as Victoria, as he was just fired from his singing gig at a second-rate club named ""Chez Lui"". To solve their problems, Toddy comes up with what he considers to be an inspired idea: with Toddy as her manager, Victoria, pretending to be a man, get a job singing as a female impersonator. If they pull this scheme off, Toddy vows Victoria, as her male alter ego, will be the toast of Paris and as such be extremely wealthy. That alter ego they decide is Polish Count Victor Grazinski, Toddy's ex-lover who was disowned by his family when they found out he was gay. The Count auditions for the city's leading agent, Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), who, impressed, gets him a gig performing in the city's best nightclub. In the audience on the successful opening night is Chicago, Illinois nightclub owner and ""businessman"" King Marchand (James Garner), a macho male who falls in the love with the woman he sees on-stage, which doesn't sit well with his current girlfriend, Norma Cassady (Leslie Ann Warren). King is shocked to learn that that woman is a man named Count Grazinski. While King tries to reconcile his romantic feelings for ""Victoria"" (in truth, King doesn't truly believe the Count is a man), his business associates won't tolerate his change in sexual orientation. Although feeling emancipated being treated as a man, Victoria, as herself, in turn, falls in love with King. To pursue something with him as a woman would mean giving up this lucrative career. But the career may also come to an end in a jail term if the authorities find out that Victoria and Toddy have committed fraud in this impersonation.—Huggo Victoria Grant (Dame Julie Andrews), a down-and-out British soprano, struggles to find work in the nightclubs of 1930s Paris. While trying to scam a free meal, Grant meets cabaret performer Carole ""Toddy"" Todd (Robert Preston), who comes up with an idea that will change everything. Acting as her manager, Toddy bills Grant as a male female impersonator. When the nightclubs eat it up, the duo makes it big - even a Chicago mobster is enamored with Grant. But keeping the truth a secret is no easy task.—Jwelch5742 Set in 1930s Paris, starving opera singer Victoria (Dame Julie Andrews) is aided by gay cabaret performer Carole ""Toddy"" Todd (Robert Preston). When Victoria dons Toddy's ex's clothes and then sends the abusive ex flying with a booming shout and an equally booming right hook, Toddy is hit with inspiration: he'll pass her off as a female impersonator. A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman? It all goes well until Chicago ""businessman"" King Marchand (James Garner), starts to investigate, sure that a man like himself could never fall for another man. The revelation of King's infatuation brings his bodyguard ""Squash"" Bernstein (Alex Karras) roaring out of the closet, and his spurned moll Norma Cassady (Leslie Ann Warren) off to Chicago to plan revenge with King's other ""business associates"".—LuHa61 Victoria Grant (Dame Julie Andrews) is a poverty-stricken soprano trying to find work in Paris in the 1930s. With the help of a worldly-wise nightclub singer, she invents her alter-ego Victor, a female impersonator who is hired to sing at a fashionable night spot. ""You want me to be a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?"" Interwoven throughout the comedy and musical numbers are some surprisingly astute observations about gender perceptions, discrimination, and the battle of the sexes.—Jeanne Baker <jbaker@erim.org> Set in 1934 Paris, France, the film opens with Richard di Nardo, a young gay hustler, emerging from the bed of gay middle-aged Carroll Todd (Robert Preston), a.k.a. Toddy after spending the night Richard dresses, steals some money from Toddy's wallet and leaves Toddy's apartment. Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews), an British national. After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. Victoria reluctantly returns to her apartment to find herself deciding whether or not to trade her rent money for an Italian dish. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and the jealous Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. After the police raid the place and close it down, Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a local restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc.The duo run out through the rain to Toddy's, and he invites her to stay when she finds that the rain has shrunk her cheap clothes. The next morning Richard shows up to collect his things. Victoria, who is wearing his clothes, hides in Toddy's closet. When she thinks that Richard might harm Toddy, she ambushes Richard and literally kicks him out. Witnessing this, Toddy is struck with the inspiration of passing Victoria off as a man (the illusion convinced Richard who stumbles downstairs to his friends waiting in the car claiming a strange man wearing his clothes hit him) and presenting her to Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the most successful agent in Paris, as a female impersonator.Cassell accepts her as Count Victor Grazinski, a gay Polish female impersonator and Toddy's new boyfriend. Cassell gets her a nightclub show and invites a collection of club owners to the opening. Among the guests is King Marchand (James Garner), an owner of multiple clubs in Chicago, who is in league with the mob. King attends with his ditzy moll Norma Cassidy (Lesley Ann Warren) and burly bodyguard Bernstein (Alex Karras), a.k.a. Squash. Victor is a hit, and King is smitten, but devastated and incredulous when she is ""revealed"" as a man at the end of her act. King is convinced that ""Victor"" is not a man.After a quarrel with Norma and his subsequent failure with her later that night, King sends her back to America. Determined to get the truth of Victor's gender, King sneaks into Victoria and Toddy's suite and confirms his suspicion when he spies her getting into the bath. He keeps his knowledge secret and invites Victoria, Toddy, and Cassell to Chez Lui, where Toddy is now welcomed due to Victor's status as a big star. Another fight breaks out with exactly the same foursome as before; Squash and Toddy are arrested with the bulk of the club clientele, but King and Victoria escape. King kisses Victoria pretending that he does not care about Victoria's gender (although he of course actually knows that she is a woman), leading them to get together.Squash returns to the suite later that night after posting his bail and catches King with Victoria in bed. King tries to explain, but soon receives a shocker himself: Squash reveals himself to be gay! Meanwhile, Labisse hires a P.I., Charles Bovin, to investigate 'Victor'. Victoria and King live together for a while, but keeping up the public act of Victoria being a man strains the relationship and King ends it. Back in Chicago, Norma tells King's club partner Sal Andretti (Norman Chancer), that King is having an affair with Victor. Also, Squash learns the truth about Victoria, but develops a romance with Toddy.Although King and Victoria are in love, things start to get complicated: Victoria is unwilling to give up her Victor persona since its made her a star, and King wishes she would drop it, for their sake and his (being seen with a homosexual was not a good thing back in the 1930s). Both attempt to keep the relationship short-term and do gay stuff together, but eventually things get too unfulfilling and frustrating for them. To make matters worse, Labisse suspects Victor of being the singer he had rejected... after a waiter at club, who used to work at the same restaurant where Victoria and Toddy met and used the cockroach to avoid paying for the meal, recognizes her and reports it to Labisse. So, Labisse hires a private investigator to investigate 'Victor'.At the same time that Victoria has decided to give up the persona of Victor in order to be with King, Sal arrives and demands that King transfer his share of the empire to Sal for a small portion of its worth. Squash tells Victoria what's happening, and she interrupts the paperwork signing to show Norma that she is really a woman, and prevent King from having to lose his stake. That night at the club Cassell tells Toddy and Victoria that Labisse has lodged a complaint against him and ""Victor"" for perpetrating a fraud. The complaint comes The Inspector tells Labisse that the performer is a man and Labisse is an idiot.In the end, Victoria joins King in the club as her real self. King is stunned, as moments earlier, the announcer had said that Victor was going to perform. Toddy is revealed as the performer, having masqueraded as ""Victor"" to fool the Inspector. After an intentionally disastrous, but hilarious performance, Toddy claims that this is his last performance. The film ends with King, Squash, Victoria, Cassell and the public applauding enthusiastically."

Still, he resolves to try and sell the halves, which are now covered in a greenish liquid.Later that night, the crater where the meteor landed is now covered in weird green plant life, as is everything the meteor came into contact with. Jordy notices his fingers have green wounds on them, presumably from the burns, but later he discovers the alien vegetation, which has now covered the entire farm. Jordy realizes that the alien plant life is now growing on his skin. As the night progresses, Jordy becomes covered in shaggy green weeds, causing him to itch.Jordy's itching skin causes him to run a bath, but before he can get in, the image of his deceased father (Bingo O'Malley) appears to him in the mirror and warns him against getting into the water, since the water is what makes the weeds grow. Jordy gets in anyway, and when morning dawns, Jordy has become a gigantic lumbering mass of alien vegetation. Desperate, he shoots himself in the head with a shotgun, revealing that the deep green weeds have even penetrated his brain. Afterwards, a radio announcer is heard forecasting heavy rainfall, suggesting that the extraterrestrial plant growth will further spread to surrounding areas.Story #3: ""Something to Tide You Over"" --
Harry Wentworth (Ted Danson) is awakened by a knock at his door from Richard Vickers (Leslie Nielsen). It seems that Harry has been having an affair with Richard's wife, Becky (Gaylen Ross), and Richard has come to confront him. Instead of attacking him, Richard plays him a cassette of Becky's terrified voice begging Harry for help. Harry accompanies Richard back to his private beachfront estate, where Richard forces him at gunpoint to climb into a hole in the sand on the beach. Burying Harry up to his neck, Richard then connects a television that displays live footage of Becky, also buried up to her neck in another location on the beach. The tide is already starting to come in and wash over her face. Harry realizes that they will both be dead soon; there is no reasoning with Richard, who seems to take great delight in his revenge. Richard abandons Harry and goes back to his beach house, where he watches the drowning deaths of both Becky and Harry on the video monitors. Before the last wave covers Harry's head, he vows revenge on Richard.Later that night, Richard is alone in the beach house when he seems to hear voices calling him. While he showers, two shuffling figures enter his home, defying the many security cameras and alarms that Richard has in place. When Richard emerges from the shower, he hears somebody in his house and immediately thinks it's Harry, somehow still alive. He is terrified to discover that the invaders in his home are the water-logged corpses of both Becky and Harry, both of them zombies covered in seaweed with green, pruning skin. Richard's gun has no effect; the zombies taunt him the same way he taunted them, and we finally see Richard, now completely insane, buried on the beach in the same way, waiting for the tide to come in. ""I can hold my breath a looooooooooong time!"" Richard yells crazily.Story #4: ""The Crate"" --
A janitor at Horlicks University, Mike (Don Keefer), discovers an old dusty crate behind a grate under a basement stairwell. He calls Professor Dexter Stanley (Fritz Weaver) to investigate with him, drawing him away from a stuffy faculty gathering. At the gathering is Dexter's good friend, Professor Henry Northrup (Hal Holbrook). Henry is married to an obnoxious shrew of a woman named Wilma (Adrienne Barbeau). Wilma, who is continually drunk, embarrasses herself and Henry at the party, and it seems as if she is about to ruin the friendship Henry shares with Dex. Henry, who is somewhat meek, fantasizes about ways to murder her.Back at the university, Dex and Mike pull the crate out from under the stairs and realize that it appears to have been under there since the late 1800s. A stamp on the outside of the wooden box indicates that it contains specimens from an arctic expedition. When the two of them open it, they sense movement from inside, and Mike is attacked by something when he puts his arm in the crate. Whatever it is pulls Mike inside, apparently eating him as it goes, and Dex catches a glimpse of a horrible, shaggy beast with huge teeth.Dex runs blindly from the lab and finds the only other person in the hall, a student named Charlie Gereson (Robert Harper). Charlie goes down into the the laboratory and finds it covered in blood, with no sign of the crate or the creature. Charlie and Dex find the crate back under the stairs, and when Charlie attempts to investigate, the creature attacks him and eats him, too.Dex is afraid to go to the police; instead he goes to Henry's house, and he arrives while Wilma is away for the evening. He tells Henry the story about the creature, and Henry knows Dexter has to be telling the truth. Henry hatches a plan. He gives Dex sleeping pills and leaves him locked in his study, asleep. Henry writes Wilma a note, concocting a bogus story designed to lure her to the laboratory. He gets there ahead of her and cleans up the evidence of the blood. Wilma can't resist Henry's trap, and she shows up at the university as planned. Henry lures her under the stairs and her obnoxious ranting draws the creature out of its crate. It eats Wilma before Henry's eyes; Henry then chains it inside the crate and dumps the crate into the deep water of a nearby quarry.When Dexter wakes up the next day, he and Henry vow to keep the secret of what really happened, and let the authorities deal with the disappearances. The final frames show the creature in its watery trap, tearing the crate to pieces and presumably escaping.5th and final story: ""They're Creeping Up on You!"" --
Upson Pratt (E.G. Marshall) is a neurotic business tycoon who lives in a sterile, white penthouse apartment atop a skyscraper in a major city. He communicates with the outside world via the telephone, treating his employees and subordinates in a cutthroat, heartless manner. One phone caller informs him that an employee, Norman Castonmeyer, has committed suicide because Pratt fired him. Pratt seems delighted rather than upset.Pratt is obsessed with cleanliness and has a huge phobia of bugs. Unfortunately, he keeps finding cockroaches in his apartment, which sets him on a rampage to correct the situation. He places telephone calls to the building superintendent (David Early) and makes thinly veiled racial slurs in an attempt to intimidate the man.As Pratt finds more bugs in his apartment, someone gets through on his private line. Norman Castonmeyer's widow, Lenore (voiced byGwen Verdon{credits say ""Ann Muffly(voice) (uncredited)""}), calls Pratt to curse him for her husband's death. Pratt is amused by her melodramatic sadness, until the cockroaches multiply. He finds them in his food processor, bits of them surfacing in the grain cereal he eats. An electrical blackout occurs, and the roaches attack, swarming by the thousands everywhere in Pratt's apartment. Pratt retreats to his ""safe room"", a climate-controlled sleep chamber, just as the phone rings. Lenore Castonmeyer's voice curses him over and over ""I hope you die! I hope you die!"", and Pratt discovers his bed swarming with roaches. The roaches quickly cover him and Pratt suffers a heart attack. The power returns, the lights come back on, and the roaches are nowhere to be seen. Pratt's body lies inside the glass sleep chamber. The superintendent knocks at Pratt's door and laughs when Pratt doesn't answer, asking ""Bugs got your tongue?"" Suddenly, swarms of roaches burst from Pratt's body, so many that they nearly fill the glass chamber.The wraparound story with Billy concludes the next morning, when two garbage men (Marty SchiffandTom Savini) discover the comic book next to the trash can in front of Billy's house. They leaf through it reverently and discover that someone has clipped a mail-in coupon for a genuine Haitian voodoo doll. Inside the house, Billy's father, Stan suddenly suffers neck pain, while up in his bedroom, Billy stabs a voodoo doll in his form of his cruel father repeatedly with a pin as payback for Stan tossing out his favorite comic book.Like each story in the comic book, this live action scene of Billy stabbing the voodoo doll becomes an illustrated comic book picture, and as the camera pulls back, we see that the comic's macabre ""host"", ""The Creep"", is holding the second issue of the ""Creepshow"" comic book in his boney hands, with Billy and his voodoo doll adorning the cover. The Creep titters, and a nearby candle flame goes out, plunging the scene into darkness.Credits begin to roll...(At the end of the credits, we once again hear The Creep's laughter)."

My Favorite Year,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084370/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aging, dissolute matinee idol is slated to appear on a live TV variety show in 1954, and a young comedy writer is tasked with the thankless job of keeping him ready and sober for the broadcast. Benjy Stone is the junior writer on the top rated variety/comedy show, in the mid 50s (the early years). It's a new medium and the rules were not fully established. Alan Swann, an Erol Flynn type actor with a drinking problem is to be that week's guest star. When King Kaiser, the headliner wants to throw Swann off the show, Benjy makes a pitch to save his childhood hero, and is made Swann's babysitter. On top of this, a union boss doesn't care for Kaiser's parody of him and has plans to stop the show.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> It's 1950's New York and the age of live television. Benjy Stone is a young writer on a major comedy-variety show. He is assigned to chaperon that week's guest Alan Swann, a faded movie-star and renowned womanizer and drinker. Benjy's job is to try and keep Swann sober and above all else, make sure he shows up for the live broadcast on Saturday evening. Benjy and Swann have a number of adventures throughout the week, including dinner with Benjy's somewhat eccentric family. In the end, both learn lessons in life from the other.—garykmcd Benjy Stone reminisces about one week in his life back in 1954 - his favorite year - when television, especially live comedy shows, were just coming into their own as popular entertainment. He was then a junior writer on one such show, ""Comedy Cavalcade"", starring the demanding and egotistical Stan 'King' Kaiser. On this week, the guest star was Benjy's swashbuckling movie idol, Alan Swann, who was past his prime as a movie star. Swann had a reputation as a boozer and a carouser, which made King and the production staff nervous about him honoring his commitment to the show. As Swann's biggest booster among the staff, Benjy was assigned to be Swann's chaperon, making sure Swann not only met his commitments, but also behaved in a family friendly manner in public. Benjy's work monitoring Swann was not an easy one, but the two became a guide for the other in navigating through issues in their respective lives. For Benjy, these included how to deal with his overbearing Jewish mother, and how to win the heart of the show's production assistant, K.C. Downing, who only saw in Benjy a manic goof-ball. For Swann, these included how to act responsibly, especially with regard to a twelve year old daughter, Tess, who he had not seen in years. Swann's unpredictability, in part in combination with issues regarding the show's on-going 'Boss Hijack' sketch, which was based on real life mobster Karl Rojeck, led to an interesting end to the week for both Benjy and Swann.—Huggo Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) is the junior writer on a top-rated variety/comedy live television show, in the mid 1950's.

Deathtrap,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083806/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Broadway playwright puts murder in his plan to take credit for a student's play. To make Sidney's slump all the more painful, Clifford Anderson, a student of one of Sidney's writing seminars, has recently sent his mentor a copy of his first attempt at playwrighting for Sidney's review and advice. The play, ""Deathtrap"", is a five character, two-act thriller so perfect in its construction that, as Sidney says, ""A gifted director couldn't even hurt it."" Using his penchant for plot, and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway, Sidney, along with Myra, cook up an almost unthinkable scheme: They'll lure the would-be playwright to the Bruhl home, kill him, and present the sure-fire script as Sidney's own. But shortly after Clifford arrives, it's clear that things are not what they seem. Even Helga Ten Dorp, a nosey psychic from next door, and Porter Milgram, Sidney's observant attorney, can only speculate where the line between truth and deception lies.—Craig C. Bailey Sidney Bruhl (Caine) is a playwright who is most famous for his mystery thriller ""The Murder Game."" Following the debut of the latest of a series of flops, he returns to his home in East Hampton and to his wife Myra (Cannon). He tells her that he's received a play called ""Deathtrap"" from a former student from a playwriting seminar. The play is ready for production and Sidney jokingly suggests that he murder the student and steal the play, a joke that becomes more serious when he learns, after calling the student, that no one else has read the play and no one else has a copy. Sidney invites the student up to Long Island.
The student, Clifford Anderson (Reeve), arrives shortly thereafter. Myra, who has a heart condition, becomes more and more agitated as the evening progresses, trying desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford on ""Deathtrap"" and share the revenue. Instead, Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. He forces Myra to help him drag Clifford into the yard to bury him.
Following the burial, the Bruhls get a visit from psychic Helga ten Dorp (Worth), who's staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga wanders around the living room and study, sensing pain and death in various spots and associated with various prop weapons and handcuffs Sidney has displayed on the wall. She warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed, Myra continues to be horrified, only slowly coming to see something of glamour in Sidney's act. Suddenly, Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Myra flees and Clifford chases after her until her heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. The men exchange a few words before their feelings emerge. They kiss, deeply and passionately. Their plan is a success: Myra is out of the way.
Immediately after Myra's funeral, Clifford moves in as Sidney's ""secretary."" Clifford works on a play which he says is about a welfare office but Sidney is suffering from writer's block. Sidney's lawyer Porter (Jones) comes over to settle some of Myra's affairs and notices Clifford is acting oddly about his manuscript pages. Sidney sends Clifford off on a pretext errand and breaks into his desk to read the manuscript. He is horrified to discover that Clifford is writing the true story of Myra's murder as a play called ""Deathtrap."" When confronted, Clifford offers to share the work and the credit. Sidney demurs: he wants to be remembered as the man who wrote ""The Murder Game,"" not as ""the faggot who knocked off his wife."" When Clifford insists he'll write the play without him, Sidney reluctantly capitulates.
A few days later, Helga stops by again, ostensibly to borrow some candles in case the power goes out in a storm that's blowing in. She meets Clifford and, when Sidney returns from a dinner party a few minutes later, warns him that Clifford is the man in boots. Sidney assures her that he'll be sending Clifford away, and Helga leaves.
Sidney asks Clifford to help him act out some possible bits of business for the play, first by resisting a frontal assault, then by demonstrating how he might wield an axe. Finally, Sidney produces a gun he's secreted for this moment, trains it on Clifford and tearfully explains to him that he cannot allow completion of ""Deathtrap"" and can only stop him with a bullet. Sidney bids Clifford good-bye and pulls the trigger.
The gun doesn't go off, though, because Clifford has taken the bullets to load a different gun that he has at the ready. Now in control again, Clifford grabs wrist and leg manacles from the prop wall and has Sidney chain himself to a chair. Clifford tells him that he's going to leave soon but, just before, will unlock one of Sidney's cuffs to allow time for his escape. Clifford will complete ""Deathtrap"" and, if anyone asks, deny that it's inspired by Sidney's story. After Clifford exits to pack, Sidney slips out of the trick cuffs (once the property of Harry Houdini) and grabs a crossbow off the weapon wall. He stalks Clifford and fells him with a single shot.
There's a body to dispose of now, but the storm hits with full force, knocking out the power. Before Sidney can find a match to light a candle, a fleeting figure scurries through the living room in a flash of lightning. It's Helga, fully aware that she's in mortal danger. Sidney finds a knife, Helga grabs a gun. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues that...
...cuts to the same struggle played live by actors before a full house, where ""Clifford"" stabs ""Sidney"" and both die, leaving ""Helga"" victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause, and at the back of the house stands Helga ten Dorp, now the author of a hit Broadway play called ""Deathtrap."""

Having used himself as bait inDeath Wish (1974)to rid New York City of its scum, Paul Kersey moves to sunny Los Angeles. And with his traumatised daughter still trying to recover from the shock, Paul seeks to bury the ugly past. Instead, Paul catches the eye of savage thugs, inviting tragedy again. But this time, Kersey knows better. Now, armed with an unforgiving semi-automatic Beretta 84 pistol, Kersey prowls the city's perilous backstreets, eager to pick up where he left off eight years ago. However, Paul's brutal justice method has already attracted unwanted attention. With police hands tied, will the notorious vigilante step up to finish the job?—Nick Riganas Paul Kersey, the vigilante, now lives in LA with his daughter, who is still recovering from her attack. He also has a new woman in his life. One day while with them, Kersey is mugged by some punks and fights back, but they get away. The leader, wanting to get back at Kersey, goes to his house, but Kersey and his daughter Carol are not there. The muggers rape his housekeeper, and when Kersey and his daughter arrive, they knock him out and kidnap her. After they assault her, she leaps out of a window to her death. Kersey then grabs his gun and goes after them. When the LA authorities deduce they have a vigilante, they decide to consult with the New York police, who had their vigilante problem. Now the New York officials, knowing that Kersey lives in LA, fears that he's back to his old habit. Fearing that Kersey will reveal that they let him go instead of prosecuting him, the NYPD sends Inspector Ochoa to make sure that doesn't happen.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> The film opens with a grand view of Los Angeles, with a news broadcast in the background detailing an increase in crime in the city. The overview of the city goes on until the end of the opening credits where we zoom in on the new house of Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) where the maid, Rosario (Silvana Gallardo), is preparing dinner. He seems to have picked up the pieces of his life to move on, as his girlfriend is KABC news/radio reporter Geri Nichols (Jill Ireland) and they both go and pick up Carol (Robin Sherwood) from the hospital and spend the day with her. Paul talks to the doctor, who says that despite her traumatic catatonia, she has begun to speak again. Her husband, Jack Toby, though not seen or mentioned, presumably divorced Carol. Paul, Geri, and Carol spend the rest of the afternoon at a carnival, where Paul offers to buy ice cream while the girls look around. While waiting in line for some ice cream, he gets mugged and his dollar bill is stolen by five gang members. At first Paul does not mind but realizes they also took his wallet. Paul manages to catch up with one of them (Jiver (Stuart K. Robinson)), but Jiver exclaims that he was not the one who took the wallet.Geri heads to do an interview with the senator while Carol and Paul go on a boat ride. The same five muggers who stole Kersey's wallet arrive at his house determined to kill him. The thugs break in, tightly bind, and gag, and then gang rape Rosario. Paul arrives home with Carol, only to get beaten unconscious when he walks in the door. Rosario tries to call the police, but the thugs hear the sound and quickly kill Rosario by bashing her head in. They then take Carol to their hideout, where one of the muggers rapes her. After the attack, she runs away from the thugs and jumps from a window, becoming impaled on the railings below.Geri arrives at the house as Paul regains consciousness and the police arrive. Lt. Mankewicz (Ben Frank) is one of the first on the scene, asking Paul about the identification of the muggers because the description was ""a little vague"". A short time later, Paul learns about the death of his daughter and is sent to the station to ID her. Later, Mankewicz asks Paul to view some photos at the station to jog his memory since Paul is the only witness. Paul declines by saying: ""it won't do any good.""The next scene is at a funeral that Paul and Geri both attend. That night, Paul pulls out a .32 caliber semi-automatic handgun he kept hidden in his closet, changes clothing, and rents a low-rent apartment in the inner city as his forward base of operations. After wandering around most of the night through the rough part of downtown L.A. Paul returns to his own house. Geri arrives the next morning and lets herself in, where she nearly discovers Paul's gun laying on a dresser. Paul quickly gets up and hides it. After Geri leaves, he calls a locksmith to have the locks on his house changed.The next night, Paul spots one of the muggers, Stomper (Kevyn Major Howard), and follows him into an abandoned hotel building as a drug deal is about to be made between his partner and two buyers. Kersey tries to be quiet as he can, but the others notice his presence when he knocks over a can. Kersey kills Stomper's partner, then orders the other two out of the room where he kills Stomper.The following evening, as he is patrolling the streets, Paul hears a scream coming from an underground parking garage where a man and a woman are being assaulted by four muggers. One of the muggers is Jiver, whom Kersey chased down the alley the day of his daughter's death. Paul opens fire on the muggers, killing two of them. Jiver is wounded, but he and the fourth mugger manage to get away. Taking a .45 caliber pistol off one of the dead muggers, Paul follows the trail of blood and manages to wound and kill Jiver at a warehouse across the street. Paul flees before the police arrive.The L.A. police quickly hear about the murders, as does the NY Police Department. Detective Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) is called by the LAPD to help. The Police Commissioner (Anthony Franciosa) thinks the vigilante killings may be done by Kersey again. Fearing that Kersey, when caught, will reveal that they let him go instead of prosecuting him, the NYPD sends Inspector Frank Ochoa to make sure that does not happen. Ochoa meets with Lt. Mankewicz, who suspects that Frank is hiding something.That night, Ochoa breaks into Geri's apartment where he meets Geri and tells her about Paul's past and recent vigilante spree. But when Geri confronts Paul, he quickly denies it, ascribing the tale to Ochoa's imagination. Paul drives Geri to work the next morning, where Ochoa is waiting. In order to keep tabs on Paul, Ochoa calls Mankiewicz and asks him to park his car near Paul's apartment (but he doesn't tell Mankiewicz about following Kersey himself).Another night later, Ochoa follows an unknowing Kersey from his house to his low-rent apartment and from there to a local square where Kersey spots the three remaining gang members who attacked him: Cutter (Laurence Fishburne), Punkcut (E. Lamont Johnson), and Nirvana (Thomas F. Duffy). Kersey follows the trio on a bus to an abandoned park, where a major drug deal goes down. Ochoa follows Kersey and sees him from a distance hiding in a bush, but decides to help Paul after detecting a spotlight heading in his direction. Ochoa warns Paul with a shot by shooting a gang member who tries to shoot Paul. Paul runs behind a tree as the gang members grab their guns and fire back. Ochoa gets shot by a hail of gunfire, but Paul manages to kill Cutter (who vainly tries to shield his head with a boom box) with a bullet through the face. Punkcut is also wounded by a gunshot to the chest, as is another gang member. Paul also shoots and kills the getaway driver and seller of the firearms, who plummets off a cliff to a fiery doom below. The final mugger, Nirvana, gets away. Paul goes over to Ochoa and asks him why he saved his life. Ochoa responds he had to side with Paul against the criminals, and tells Paul to kill Nirvana for him. Ochoa dies as the police arrive, and Paul escapes into the night. The police get the name of Ochoa's killer from a badly injured Punkcut by inflicting pain, who succumbs to his injuries and dies.A few days later, Nirvana (whose real name is revealed to be Charles Wilson) is found by the police hiding out in an apartment. Paul, monitoring the police radio frequency from an acquired radio scanner, tries to get to Nirvana to kill him before the police do. But in the apartment building hallway, Paul narrowly misses his opportunity for a kill when he gets slashed on the arm by Nirvana during a chase. Nirvana runs outside when he sees the police approaching and gets tasered, but with no effect due to the influence of PCP. He is finally arrested after stabbing several officers.Tried and found criminally insane, Charles 'Nirvana' Wilson is sent to McLarren State Hospital. Paul comes along with Geri to the hospital where she is interviewing Charles Wilson's doctor. The visit allows Paul to secretly steal a facility ID card and a white doctor's lab coat. Despite his plans for revenge to kill the last surviving thug who assaulted him, Paul has lunch with Geri the next day and proposes to her. Geri accepts.The night they plan to go to Mexico for their wedding, Paul uses his altered doctor ID and stolen lab coat to gain access to the hospital and confronts Wilson in the hospital meeting room. They have a violent fight and Kersey is stabbed repeatedly by Wilson with a scalpel. But when Wilson slams Kersey up against an electrical device, Kersey ducks the oncoming punch. Wilson's hand smashes through the machine and Kersey turns the power up, electrocuting Wilson. Donald Kay (Charles Cyphers), the head orderly on duty, witnesses Wilson's death, but sympathizes with Kersey and gives him three minutes to escape from the hospital before sounding the alarm.Geri goes to his apartment later that night and finds the scanned copy of the stolen ID. She realizes that Paul is actually the vigilante after she hears a report of Wilson's death on the radio. She puts the paper and the engagement ring on the table and drives off. Paul arrives home minutes later to an empty apartment.Five months later, Paul is at his office speaking to his clients about a party in celebration of a new architectural design. His boss Elliott Cass (Michael Prince) invites him to a party that very evening, and when Paul is asked if he's free, he answers: ""What else would I be doing?"" The movie ends with gunshots heard on L.A.'s skid row, implying that Paul will continue his vigilante spree undisturbed."

She's about to marry an egyptologist there. Not until three years after the death of her husband Jolly, Kay dares to move back into their former house, persuaded by her new fiancé Rupert. But soon her worst expectations come true, when not only her old memories haunt her, but also Jolly's ghost, who doesn't approve of her new mate.

Grease 2,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084021/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A British student at a 1960s American high school must prove himself to the leader of a girls' gang whose members can only date greasers. Two years after the life-altering events inGrease (1978), Sandy's cousin Michael, a straight-laced English student, is the new guy at Rydell High. Stephanie, the Pink Ladies' foxy blonde leader, is about to break up with Johnny, the T-Birds' leader, but she still likes her men dangerous, even as Michael starts to attract her attention. Now Michael needs to up his game: learn how to ride a motorcycle and transform himself into Stephanie's hot leather-clad fantasy. Is he up to the task?—Nick Riganas Return to rockin' Rydell High for a whole new term. It's 1961, two years after the original Grease gang graduated, and there's a new crop of seniors - and new members of the coolest cliques on campus, the Pink Ladies and T-Birds. Michael Carrington is the new guy in school - but he's been branded a brainiac. Can he fix up an old motorcycle, don a leather jacket, avoid a rumble with the leader of the T-Birds, and win the heart of Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone? He'll sure try.—Anonymous It is September 1961, two years after the original Grease gang were Rydell High seniors in the first movie and a new academic year is just beginning at Rydell High School ('Back To School Again'). The Pink Ladies are now led by the beautiful Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer), who feels she has ""outgrown"" her relationship with the arrogant leader of the The T-Birds, Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed) during summer break. A new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut English student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield), the cousin of Sandy Olsson (the character played by Olivia Newton-John in the first Grease movie). Michael quickly becomes smitten with Stephanie, despite the gentle warning of the sole remaining lead character from the first film, Frenchy (Didi Conn), who is returning to Rydell High to get her diploma was told about Michael's arrival in a letter from Sandy and helps Michael get settled into the school atmosphere as Sandy's behest. Michael takes an instant liking to Stephanie, but Frenchy tells him that she will not date him since he is not a T-Bird.At the local bowling alley, a competitive game ('Score Tonight') turns sour due to the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Johnny flirts with Stephanie's friend and fellow Pink Lady, Paulette Rebchuck (Lorna Luft), to make Stephanie jealous, and she retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, which happens to be Michael.Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael attempts to ask her out the next day at an audition for the school talent show, but discovers that she has a very specific vision of her ideal man ('Cool Rider'). He realizes that he will only win her affection if he turns himself into a cool rider, and begins saving up for a motorcycle by selling completed homework assignments to the academically-challenged T-Birds. Michael buys the bike, fixes it up and spends all his spare time after school learning to ride it.At school a few days later, there is an an unusual, largely interactive biology lesson ('Reproduction') given by new substitute teacher Mr. Stuart (Tab Hunter) over sex education.That evening, a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords (led by Balmudo, who also played ""Leo"" in the first film and also a rival of the T-Birds) surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before the fight starts, a lone anonymous biker, wearing all black clothing as well as a motorcycle helmet and dark goggles to cover his face, appears and defeats the enemy gang, performing impressive stunts and leaping over police cars to disappear into the night ('Who's That Guy?'). Stephanie is instantly fascinated with the stranger.The following day at school, Frenchy tells Michael about that motorcycle chase and a strange guy swept Zinone out of her bobby socks. Michael confides in Frenchy he's the one and just as he was about to tell Frenchy his game plan, Zinone and the other Pink Ladies come into the room. That's when Michael attempts to tell Stephanie that he is the ""Cool Rider"", but becomes tongue-tied. Frenchy notices a patch on Rhonda's nose. (She is also wearing glasses similar to the ones Dinah Manoff wore at one point during the first movie when she played Marty.)In a short comic scene, one of the T-Birds, Louis DiMucci (Peter Frechette), attempts to trick his sweetheart Sharon (Maureen Teefy) into losing her virginity to him by taking her to Michael's uncle's fallout shelter and faking a nuclear explosion ('Let's Do It For Our Country'), but the plan backfires and she runs off in horror.Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider while working at her after school job at her family's gas station, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies; before Michael disappears again, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the talent show, in which the Pink Ladies and T-Birds are performing. Stephanie wonders how the Cool Rider knew about the talent show but fails to deduce it could be a Rydell High School student since only they knew about the show. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens to fight the ""Cool Rider"" if he sees him with her again, and the group has an argument about who belongs to whom. The Pink Ladies exit haughtily, although this has little effect on the T-Birds' innate self-confidence as they stroll off in the night ('Prowlin').At school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help with her essay on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but although she has warmed to him considerably, he still cannot reveal his double identity.By this point, Stephanie has begun to realize that, despite his shy, bookworm outward appearance, Michael is a kind, good hearted guy who genuinely cares about her. She then slowly begins to discover that she has similar feelings for him, and starts to reciprocate his crush. These events are not lost on their mutual acquaintances, and Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies for his ""rep"" and subtly threatens that the T-Birds will beat up Michael if she refuses (""Don't damage the rep we won't damage new friends.""). Stephanie is visibly upset by this but refuses to quit the Pink Ladies. Although still head over heels for the Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become smitten with him as well, as Michael ponders with himself over his continuing charade he puts out to Stephanie. ('Charades').The night of the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet outside the school, but are instantly ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael in a motorcycle chase, with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car. They pursue him to a closed-off construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie inconsolable thinking her Cool Rider is dead although both the T Birds & Pink Ladies try to convince her that he must have survived and made the jump and will show up again.At the talent show, the T-Birds tie up the competition for their act in the boys locker room and drench them in the showers to ensure their winning. During the Pink Ladies' number ('A Girl For All Seasons'), Stephanie is overcome and stops singing her part and sinks to the stage floor. Oblivious to the audience, she enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker in a sort of ""biker heaven"" backdrop ""([Love Will Turn] Back The Hands Of Time)"". As her reverie finishes, it appears she has been singing a solo; she is duly named winner of the contest, and crowned the queen of the upcoming luau, with Johnny hailed as king.The school year ends with the graduation luau the next day ('Rock-A-Hula Luau') during which Johnny and Stephanie later engage in another argument while being carried onto the pool in a floating throne. The Cycle Lords suddenly appear and begin to destroy the celebration, but are stopped by the emergence of the Cool Rider, much to the surprise of Stephanie. After roundly defeating the Cycle Lords and leaping over the pool on his motorcycle, he finally reveals himself to all in attendance to be Michael. After his initial shock, Johnny offers him a T-Bird jacket and welcomes him into the gang, and Stephanie finally accepts that she can have ""two for the price of one"" a Cool Rider and a Shakespeare. All of the couples pair off (Michael/Stephanie, Johnny/Paulette, Lewis/Sharon, Davey/Dolores & Rhonda/Goose), happily at graduation as the class of 1962 (Note: Davey was not a senior so he doesn't graduate then) sings ('We'll Be Together'). The credits start rolling and just like in the first movie, it's in the style of a yearbook."
Halloween III: Season of the Witch,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085636/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Kids all over America want Silver Shamrock masks for Halloween. Doctor Daniel Challis seeks to uncover a plot by Silver Shamrock owner Conal Cochran. After the death of her father under suspicious circumstances, Ellie Grimbridge and Dr Daniel Challis decide to investigate the shady activities of Conal Cochran: the owner of the Silver Shamrock Novelties company. Before long, they discover Cochran's diabolical plot to brainwash the children of America into doing his bidding through a mixture of ancient rituals, technology, and witchcraft.

On Halloween, when the Silver Shamrock jingle is played, Cochran's plans for the deaths of all who wear the masks will come to fruition....—Anonymous In northern California, on the night of Saturday, October 23, we see a man running down a semi-rural road as the movie opens. Obviously being pursued, the man Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs into a junkyard to try to hide or find help. Then we see his pursuers coming down the road in a car and entering the junkyard. The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man with gray-silver colored hair (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from the Stonehenge ruins in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power. Just then, the man from the junkyard bursts into the gas station, clutching a Silver Shamrock pumpkin Halloween mask, begging for help. The attendant, clearly disturbed, takes the man to the hospital.Meanwhile, not too far away, the recently divorced Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) stops off at home to see his ex-wife Linda (Nancy Kyes) and their two children. He's late arriving, a not uncommon occurrence with him. He has brought the kids some masks for the upcoming Halloween, but they are disappointed, saying ""Mom already got us masks"". They were Silver Shamrock masks. While Dan and his ex are talking, the kids turn on the TV and see another Silver Shamrock commercial, which they seem to enjoy immensely. Dan's beeper goes off - he is needed at the hospital. After promising to pick up the kids next weekend, he leaves.At the hospital, Dan meets the guy from the junkyard and talks briefly to the gas station attendant who drove him in. The guy wakes up when he hears yet another Silver Shamrock commercial on a hospital TV, gasping out ""They're going to kill us! All of us!!!!"" while still clutching his mask. Feeling the man is deranged, Dan has him sedated and put in a hospital bed to recover. There being no further patients at the moment, Dan, making the most of having been recently divorced, goes off to flirt with the nurses, drink some beer, and take a nap in the doctors' lounge.Not long after, a car arrives at the hospital, and another silent, well-dressed man steps out and enters the building. He walks to the junkyard guy's room, where he is sleeping. The man clamps one of his hands over the guy's mouth (waking him up), and uses his other hand to poke his fingers in the guy's eye sockets and pull his skull apart. He is much stronger than he appears. A nurse walks in just then and confronts him; the man just walks away. Seconds later, the nurse sees what just happened and screams. Dan Challis, woken from his nap, comes running, just in time to see the man walk back to the parking lot. Dan runs out to confront him, but the man is already getting back into his car. Rather than drive away, he drenches himself with gasoline and lights himself on fire, causing an explosion that destroys both himself and the car.In the morning, the police are investigating, while Dan is arguing with his ex-wife over the phone. A dark-haired girl (Stacey Nelkin) walks into the room, the daughter of the man who was killed. Her name is Ellie Grimbridge, and we then learn the dead guy's name was Harry Grimbridge. Dan and the police try to comfort Ellie as best they can after she identifies the body. Both Dan and the police are bewildered by the event. After hearing the description, the police thought the well-dressed murderer was on drugs, but Dan, the doctor, said it appeared the man was in complete control of himself.In the middle of the week, Dan goes to see the assistant coroner, a woman named Teddy (Wendy Wessberg), and asks her what she has discovered. The answer is not much, the guy was just ashes. She will be looking at the remains of the burned car for clues for a while yet. Dan asks her to keep him posted. He is still clearly rattled by the event and wants some answers.On Friday, two days before Halloween, Ellie finds Dan alone in a bar, where he had been drinking and watching TV. One of the nurses had told her she would probably find him there. She thanked him for attending her father's funeral and asked him if he had seen anything that might help her figure out what had happened. Dan, still wanting to know what had happened, told her about the mask and her father's last words - ""They're going to kill us!"" Dan and Ellie go to the late Harry's store downtown. It had been a distressed toy store before Harry's death; now it was ""closed until further notice"". The new shopping malls had siphoned off a lot of his business, but the town's children had been keeping the store afloat. There, Ellie showed Dan her own investigations. Harry had kept meticulous records at his business, and everything checked out until October 20, when he had gone to pick up more masks - Silver Shamrock masks, which were selling well. Dan remarked that Harry had been holding a Silver Shamrock mask when he was killed. Harry had never made it to his appointments on the 21st.Ellie wanted to go to the Silver Shamrock factory to investigate further, and Dan, intrigued by the mystery (and attracted to Ellie), went along with her. Just before driving out of town in Ellie's car with only a cooler for luggage, Dan calls his ex-wife to back out of his promise to pick up the kids the next afternoon, promising to pick them up on Halloween instead. As Dan and Ellie drive away, we see some TVs in a store window showing yet another Silver Shamrock commercial.In the weeks leading up to Halloween, Silver Shamrock had undertaken a major advertising blitz, saturating the airwaves with a catchy but obnoxious commercial for its Halloween masks, that counted down the days until Halloween to the tune of ""London Bridge"". The announcer in the commercial said that Silver Shamrock would be sponsoring the airing of the movie ""Halloween"" on Halloween night, to be followed immediately (at 9 p.m.) by a ""big giveaway"" - for which all the children were supposed to wear their masks and watch the TV closely.On Friday afternoon, Dan and Ellie arrive in Santa Mira, home of Silver Shamrock, a small town that seems to give off some weird vibes (a reference to the 1956 film 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' which is set in a small town of the exact same name). It was founded in 1887 by Irish immigrants, and the principal (almost the only) industry was the Silver Shamrock factory, started after World War II by a man named Conal Cochran. They drive past the factory, which looks like the only major industry there. The townspeople stare at them, making them both uncomfortable. They see loudspeakers and moving video cameras on top of the utility poles. Not knowing exactly what to do next, they go to a cheap motel and rent a room, where they can talk strategy in privacy.While the motel keeper Rafferty (Michael Currie) is showing Ellie the room, Dan goes off to the office, ostensibly to pay the bill, but he checks the register while he was there. Harry Grimbridge's name was on the register. Ellie sees Cochran's car drive past, although she can't see inside the darkened windows. On his way back from the office, Dan meets another motel guest, Buddy Kupfer (Ralph Strait), a Silver Shamrock salesman; and his wife Betty (Jadeen Barbor) and their bratty son ""Little Buddy"" (Brad Schacter). He also meets Marge (Garn Stephens), a department store owner who sold, among other things, Silver Shamrock masks at her store in San Francisco. Buddy seems to be enjoying the trip, but Marge is put out at having to come all the way to ""this dump"" because the factory messed up an order.Ellie wants to go to the factory right away and investigate further, but Dan convinces her to hold off for a while. After a moment of awkwardness, in which time Dan isn't sure how well an advance would be received, Ellie gives him a clear opening, and he pounces on it. Outside, late afternoon is moving towards sunset, and at 6 P.M., the loudspeakers announce that the town is under curfew for the night.After dark, Dan goes out to the liquor store (which is open in spite of the curfew); on the way back, he meets Starker (Jonathan Terryas Jon Terry), a local drunk and homeless man who begs a drink from the bottle off of him. Dan, seizing an opportunity to collect information, asks Starker about Cochran and Silver Shamrock, and he has nothing good to say about him. Starker tells Dan that he had applied for a job there years before, but had been turned away; in fact, all of Cochran's workers had been brought in from outside Santa Mira. In contrast to the motel keeper who had praised Cochran, Starker points out the video cameras and curses Cochran. He then says that he hoped to burn down Cochran's factory someday. Dan gives him a tip for his information and goes back to the motel. However, a few minutes later, the silver-haired well-dressed assassin shows up with another accomplice. Starker tries to back away from his drunken statements, but the men are unmoved, and while one of them restrains him, the silver-haired man pulls his head off of his shoulders with his bare hands.Back at the motel, Ellie meets Marge, and they talk briefly about the factory and the masks. Marge notices that the quality has suffered a little bit - the trademark tag fell off one of the masks. Marge returns to her room, where she accidentally knocks the tag onto the floor, where it falls upside down revealing a small microchip - but she doesn't notice right away, sitting in bed reading. Meanwhile, Dan arrives back at the motel and stops at the office to call Teddy. Teddy's investigation has gone nowhere - she found no human remains and had to assume that someone had mixed up the envelopes, and she had wasted two days examining burnt car parts. Dan returns to the room, where he and Ellie have a drink.While they are enjoying themselves, Marge decides she's had enough reading for the night and gets ready to sleep, but sees the trademark and the microchip on the floor and, being curious, starts to examine it and poke at it with a hairpin. Suddenly, a lightning bolt shoots out of the trademark at Marge's head, burning it almost beyond recognition. A single bug crawls from her mouth as she dies.Dan and Ellie are woken by yet another disturbance outside. It's a van, not an ambulance come to pick up Marge. The men from the van ignore Dan's offer of help, despite the fact that he is a doctor. As the van leaves, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy) pulls up and we meet him for the first time. Dan overhears the motel keeper telling Cochran that Marge had been hit by a ""misfire."" (What could that mean?)The next morning is Saturday the 30th. Dan calls Teddy at work again. Teddy has examined all the ashes but has not found a single trace of human remains, and she is wondering if someone has been tampering with the evidence. Dan asks her to investigate Cochran. However, after Dan hangs up, we see that the telephone is bugged.Dan and Ellie go to the factory in the morning, but learn nothing except Harry had picked up his masks and left. They are ready to go, but they meet Buddy Kupfer on their way in for a tour of the factory. Cochran comes out to meet them, and Buddy convinces Cochran to have them along on the tour. They see the workers making the masks. After seeing the masks, Cochran takes them to another room where there are some other Silver Shamrock products besides masks - mostly toys and novelties. Cochran gives Buddy Jr. a mask that has been through ""final processing"" - but he remains evasive about what final processing entails. He invites the Kupfers to breakfast the next morning, asking for Buddy's opinion about some more sales materials.While Cochran and Buddy are talking, Dan's attention wanders, and he spots several of the well-dressed guards. While he is telling Ellie in a low voice about it, Ellie spots Harry's car in one of the buildings. She runs forward to check it out, but several more of the well-dressed men step out from their posts and block her path. Dan and Ellie return to the motel room and go over what they know as it gets dark outside. They decide to leave the town and call the police.Dan goes to the office, but he cannot reach anyone on the telephone. No matter what number he dials, he gets a recorded message that the call cannot be completed. Returning to the motel room, he discovers Ellie is gone. She has been kidnapped by a group of well-dressed guards. The well-dressed guards surround him in the parking lot and approach him. Dan runs back to his room and escapes out the bathroom window and gets away from the guards, who are also driving up and down the streets looking for him. Dan tries to use a pay phone, but he gets the same recorded message there, too. Hoping to rescue Ellie, he goes to the factory, sneaks onto the grounds, and breaks into the building.At first, he sees no one, but after a brief search, he finds an old woman knitting. When he confronts her, he finds that the old woman is actually an elaborate machine! Then the silver-haired well-dressed guard finds him. Dan fights him, but he seems to be unaffected by his punches. After Dan punches him again, the guard goes limp, Dan pulls wires out of the guard's stomach and oil flows from his mouth. The guard was a far more elaborate machine! Two more android guards come up behind Dan and capture him. He had trouble beating one, and he has no chance against two. Cochran comes to see them before the guards take Dan to wherever he is to spend the night.On Sunday, Halloween morning, Cochran and several of the well-dressed android guards accompany Dan to the ""final processing"" room. On the way there, Cochran brags about how realistic his guards and other workers were. Once in the final processing room, Dan sees several workers on a scaffold chipping tiny pieces out of a large rock... the stolen stone from Stonehenge! There are some workstations and TVs arranged in a circle in front of the rock. The workers take a tiny particle of the rock and put it in the microchips on the back of each trademark on the masks.Cochran shows Dan on the video monitors Ellie tied up in one room, Marge's corpse in another room, and then, the room into which the guards are escorting the Kupfer family. The room is ominously labeled ""Test Room A"". The room is made up to look like an ordinary living room. At Cochran's order, one of the guards pushes the buttons to make a video play on the TV in the test room, where Little Buddy is trying to watch TV. It is the video that will be played later that night - the ""big giveaway"" video. It opens like any other Silver Shamrock commercial, but as the announcer exhorts his audience to watch, the video gives way to a jack-o-lantern flashing on the screen. After a few seconds, the rapt Little Buddy grasps his head and collapses. Multitudes of bugs and snakes crawl out of the mask. Betty faints; Buddy Sr. freaks out and tries to escape from the locked room, but he is attacked and killed by the snakes. The flashing jack-o-lantern and sounds from the commercial trigger the particle of rock in the microchip - now we see how the death of Marge was an accident, it had gone off when it wasn't supposed to. After a couple of minutes, the entire Kupfer family is dead, and Cochran cuts the video and has the guards lead Dan away.Next, we see children in cities all over the country hearing the commercial reminding them to watch the big giveaway at 9:00 pm, buying Silver Shamrock masks, and trick-or-treating. Challis's own kids are anxious to watch the big giveaway while wearing their masks.In the evening, Teddy is still trying to make sense of the autopsy and tries to reach Dan in Santa Mira, but she gets the same recorded message that Dan heard. She tries the chief coroner instead, realizing that a lot of the things she has found in the ashes didn't look like car parts. Suddenly realizing something, she reaches for the phone once more to call the police, but one of the well-dressed android guards from Silver Shamrock sneaks up behind her and kills her with a power drill to her head.At 7:30 p.m., Cochran leaves Dan tied up in a room in front of a TV playingJohn Carpenter'sHalloween (1978)- to be followed by the big giveaway. Dan asks him why. Cochran explains that the ""good"" reason is that it's all a great joke, but the ""real"" reason is he is carrying on an ancient Celtic tradition of ritual sacrifice. Cochran puts one of his masks over Dan's head and wishes him a happy Halloween just before he leaves.Once he has left, Dan looks at the clock and sets to work trying to escape. He manages to scoot his chair over toward the TV, then kicks the screen in. At least the flashing jack-o-lantern can't come on now. Using a piece of broken glass from the TV, he cuts the straps that bind him, removes the mask, and throws it over the video camera watching the room. The room is locked, but Dan escapes through the ventilation ducts. It's after 8 p.m. now and time is running out.One of Cochran's worker androids notices that Dan is no longer in the room, and they set about looking for him. He has, by this time, escaped to the roof of the building, and finds another way back in. He has to play hide-and-seek with the well-dressed android guards again. Then he finds a phone, tries it, and it works - Cochran had cut off the town's access to outside lines, but not from within the factory itself. He calls his ex-wife and desperately tries to convince her to get rid of the Silver Shamrock masks, but she refuses. She is angry that Dan has once again broken his promise (this time to pick the kids up on Halloween and take them trick-or-treating), accuses him of being drunk, and/or jealous that the kids liked the masks better than the ones Dan picked out. She tells him to go to hell and hangs up. He can't try calling her again or someone else because the guards are coming back.Dan searches the building some more and finds the room where Ellie is being held. He releases her, but the guards can now see him on the video cameras and know where he is. He manages to escape them for the time being, coming to the back of the final processing/control room. There he finds a box of the microchips - ready to be installed on the masks. An idea comes to mind.He takes a box of the micro-chipped trademarks, sneaks over to the computers, and pushes the buttons he saw the guard push that morning - the ones that start playing the big giveaway video. This time, it starts playing on all the TVs in the control room. He runs back to the edge of the room and climbs onto a catwalk overhead and dumps the box onto the floor below. The microchips activate as they get near the TV's playing the flashing jack-o-lantern, ""killing"" the worker-androids - but not Cochran, who looks up at them, unaffected, and applauds. The flashing TVs, forming a circle, and the rock from Stonehenge, start to glow; something supernatural is taking place. Lightning bolts shoot out of both towards Cochran, who is transformed to stone and disappears. Then sparks fly from the stone and everything in the room starts to catch fire. Soon, the entire factory is burning - Starker got his wish posthumously. Dan and Ellie run from the factory, get into Ellie's car still at the motel, and with Dan driving this time they drive away.Dan and Ellie escape from Santa Mira, but the commercial is still set to go on the air at 9 p.m., which is only about 15 minutes away now. Dan asks Ellie if she can think of anything, then notices how strangely passive she has been and... how she hasn't spoken a single word since her rescue. When Ellie turns her head and attacks him, he realizes that the Ellie he rescued was another android, with a new skin to look exactly like the real Ellie (the real one presumably having been killed by the well-dressed guards or perished in the fire). Dan wrecks the car trying to fight off the 'Ellie-bot'. The crash rips one of robot Ellie's arms off, and Dan has little trouble dispatching the rest of her with a tire iron by decapitating her, but now he is without transportation and takes off running on foot. It's about 8:50 p.m. The 'Ellie-bot' continues to function.Panting and desperate to find a phone, he arrives at a gas station.... the same one where Harry took refuge eight days earlier. The attendant, Walter, recognizes Dan from the hospital: ""Hey, don't I know you?"" It's straight up 9:00 when Dan pleads with the technician at the TV station over the phone to take the commercial off the air, saying that everyone watching will die if it is allowed to air. Walter looks at him kind of funny as he shouts into the phone. Two children run inside to watch the commercial on TV at the gas station. Finally, the technician accedes to Dan's desperate request, and a ""technical difficulties"" sign appears on that TV station. The children switch to another station playing the commercial - it too goes off the air. They switch to a third station, and this time the commercial continues to play. The flashing jack-o-lantern appears and Dan continues to beg the technician to take the commercial off the air. Dan becomes ever more hysterical and screams to stop the commercial, as the commercial on the third station continues to run... and the movie suddenly ends on this cliffhanger."

The Beastmaster,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083630/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A sword-and-sorcery fantasy about a young man's search for revenge. Armed with supernatural powers, the handsome hero and his animal allies wage war against marauding forces. Dar, the son of a king, is hunted by a priest after his birth, but his new adoptive father rescues him from a cult ritual and taken to be raised in a humble village, where he learns that he has the ability to communicate with animals. Years later when he's all grown up, the priest's followers murder his adoptive father and other villagers, and Dar begins his quest for revenge, befriending several animals along the way.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Maax is a twisted cult leader out to steal the throne of King Zed. King Zed then banishes Maax, but Maax sends one of his three witches to steal Zed's unborn son. Ripping him right out of his mother's womb with magic and placing it a cow's womb, she takes him to die. Then a brave hunter kills the witch, rescues the baby boy, and takes him home to raise as his own. He names him Dar and while the boy is still very young, his new father finds out that he possesses the power to communicate with animals. Later, Maax sends his horde of thugs to wipe out the peaceful village that Dar calls home. However, thanks to a brave dog, Dar survives again and plans to use his powers to kill Maax to avenge his people and his foster father.—Zedd The gates to the city of Aruk are raised, and Maax (Rip Torn), high priest of the city's patron god, Ar, rides in with two underling priests. He goes to the central ziggurat that serves as the city's temple, and meets with three witch-women in its interior. The witches appear as shapely women with hideously disfigured faces. The witches tell Maax that he is doomed by a prophecy; he will die at the hands of the son of King Zed (Rod Loomis). Zed's wife is still pregnant with the child, and the prince will grow into a man that will kill Maax. The high priest defies the prophecy and announces that the unborn son will die. Maax sees Ar as a bloodthirsty god who demands the life of Aruk's children in sacrifice, and offering the king's son will prevent the prophecy from coming true.At that moment, King Zed storms into the temple with Seth (John Amos), the captain of the guard, and three other city guards who have swords ready. Zed has heard that Maax intends to offer innocent children in sacrifice to Ar, and he announces he won't allow it. Zed declares that Maax is to be banished from Aruk to dwell in the outlands among the barbarian Juns. When Maax boldly declares that Zed's own son must be cut from his mother, branded with the sign of Ar and sacrificed, Seth advances on Maax, sword at the ready, and King Zed warns Maax that he could have him executed for such talk. Maax looks over both shoulders at his underling priests, who hang themselves. Zed looks on this with only scorn and contempt, and orders Maax removed from the city. Maax is put on a horse and escorted out, passing by an old woman with a cow.This old woman is one of Maax's witch-women in disguise. At night, as Zed and his wife (Vanna Bonta) sleep, the witch creeps into their bedchamber. She pours a foul liquid across their throats, paralyzing them and rendering them mute. Zed and his wife awaken to find the witch focusing on the wife's pregnant abdomen, waving her hands over it. Zed's wife convulses in silent agony as the unborn baby is transferred out of her womb into the cow. Zed can only watch as his beloved wife dies from the violation, and the witch, with a dark cackle, tells him that his unborn son belongs to her, before vanishing.The witch takes the cow out into the fields, and cuts it open, extracting the baby. But as she brands the baby with the symbol of Ar, the dark ritual is seen by a passing traveler who is armed with a sword and a throwing weapon called a kapa. Despite the witch's dark powers, the traveler is able to slay her and rescue the baby. He brings the baby back to his home village of Emir to raise as his own son.The boy is named Dar, and grows into an energetic youth. His father raises and teaches him well. One day, when Dar is a youth, he and his father are practicing swordplay. His father demonstrates how to throw the kapa, and, as a prank, uses it to pluck off the headwrap of a villager named Tiis. The kapa lodges in a tree that Tiis is near, and Dar and his father laugh. But Dar stops laughing as he sees a rustle in the tree line, and then urgently tells his father to run. As Tiis tries to retrieve his headwrap, something concealed by the tree line yanks him out of view, and there are sounds of growling before Tiis is hurled back out. A huge bear has grabbed Tiis and mauled him to death, and it emerges from the tree line toward Dar and his father. Dar's father loses his balance and twists his ankle. He yells at Dar to run and save himself. But Dar slowly walks toward the bear, continuing to stare at it. Dar's father watches in wonder as the bear quietly sinks back down to all fours and turns, walking away. They can do nothing for Tiis, but Dar's father sees that his adopted son has very curious powers neither of them understand; he can touch the mind of a beast. He holds Dar's hand, where the brand is still visible, and tells him that the gods have put their mark on him, and it will be his guide until he finds out why.More years pass, and Dar is a tall, handsome, strapping man (now played by Marc Singer). Dar takes his dog, Todo, and goes out with a number of other young village men to work in a field outside the village.As the men work, Dar picks up a stick and smiles at Todo. He throws the stick for Todo to fetch. But on reaching the stick, Todo doesn't return. He stands his ground and begins to bark. At first, Dar just smiles at his pet and companion, but as Todo continues barking, Dar and the other villagers realize the dog is aware of danger. They all run up to where the dog stands. Far in the distance, a great cloud of dust and the rumbling sound of galloping horses, approach Emir; a band of marauding Jun barbarians.Dar's father and a few other village elders draw their swords and stand at the village perimeter as the Jun horde approaches, but they are quickly overrun by the mounted barbarians. By the time Dar and the village men arrive, the barbarians are attacking everyone and setting the village on fire. The terrified villagers all fight with desperation. Dar manages to grab up a sword and, picking out the Jun leader (Tony Epper), charges toward him. Another Jun barbarian comes riding up behind Dar and clubs him from behind with a flail, knocking him unconscious. The Juns proceed to slaughter all of the villages, women and children included, and even Todo, as he tries to drag Dar to safety, is hit by a crossbow bolt loosed by one of the Juns. As the Juns finish their work, Maax rides up to the village with a number of priests and flashes a terrible smile. Looking pleased, he fails to notice Dar laying on the ground just a few feet in front of his horse; the brand of Ar on his palm. Todo grabs Dar by his clothing again and resumes pulling him away.Dar slowly awakens, becoming aware of the land rushing past him as if he were a great avian in flight. He blinks, and hie eyesight refocuses and returns. He sits up and sees Todo lying near him, a crossbow bolt protruding from his side. Todo had managed to drag him to safety before collaping and dying from his wound. Dar walks in a daze among the ruins of his village; the corpses of many of the villagers have been impaled on the village's wooden beams. Perched on one of the perimeter beams is a great brown eagle. Dar locks eyes with the raptor, the two looking close at each other for a couple of moments.Dar discards his upper garment and pulls a leather gauntlet over his hand to hide the brand. He arranges all the slain villagers in a circular formation, laying Todo across the body of Dar's father, with the father's arm placed around Todo's neck. Dar burns the bodies and takes his father's sword and throwing kapa. He remembers his father's words about the mark on his hand being his guide, and that if anything happened to the father, Dar should look for their enemies, the Juns, and seek his destiny in the valley of Aruk.As Dar begins walking away from the ruins of Emir, he passes by the eagle again. Once more they lock eyes, and Dar forges a bond with the eagle, and it begins to follow him as a companion. (NOTE: though Dar never speaks a name for the eagle, we learn in the two Beastmaster sequels that the eagle was named Sherak, so that name will be used in this synopsis for the sake of uniformity).Dar runs through a shallow stream toward his clothing after having bathed. As he is dressing, two ferrets come creeping through the brush. Dar turns in surprise as the ferrets grab hold of his leather skirt and begin running off with it. Dar chases them, losing sight of them in the brush, and takes a wrong turn, tumbling from a cliff and landing in quicksand. The ferrets, curious, crawl along an overhanging branch of a tree. Dar cannot reach the branch himself, and tells the ferrets that since they got him into the situation, they need to help get him out. The little animals, of course, don't understand spoken human speech, but Dar is no ordinary human. He looks up intently at the ferrets, concentrating. One of the ferrets crawls further along the branch, weighing it down, as the other begins gnawing on it. The branch tips down enough for Dar to grab it and pull himself to safety. The ferret who had crawled along the branch, slips off into the quicksand, but Dar is able to pluck it out and rescue it. Dar names the ferrets Kodo and Podo, his newest friends.Dar continues walking as Kodo and Podo ride in his belt pouch. He pauses along a cliff to rest, Sherak landing near him. Dar starts looking around, concerned. He hears the growling of a great feline and sees several mounted Juns chasing a beast, through the eyes of the beast. He sees one of the Juns snare the beast with a heavy rope lasso, and then sees one end of the lasso tied around a heavy wooden stake driven into the ground. Running to investigate, he sees the Juns tormenting a great black tiger they've captured. Taking Kodo and Podo from his pouch, Dar tells them that the tiger should be rescued.Before Dar can throw his kapa, one of the Juns ambushes him from behind, but Dar his fast enough to grab the Jun's arm and throw him over his shoulder. They both tumble down the hillside to the ground where another Jun readies his crossbow. Dar throws his kapa, and the Jun ducks before again aiming his crossbow, but the kapa circles around like a boomerang, hitting the Jun square in the back. As another Jun rides up, crossbow at the ready, Dar gives a high pitched squawking sound toward Sherak and grabs the one he's grappling with, using him as a human shield against the crossbow bolt. Sherak then swoops down on the mounted Jun, clawing at his eyes through the eyeholes in his leather hood, causing him to tumble from his horse. The two wranglers run for their weapons, but Kodo and Podo dart forward, snatching the bolts out of their crossbows. The wranglers grab their swords and run at Dar, who kicks one away and slays the second. Dar then grabs his kapa and hurls it, cutting through the rope lasso and freeing the tiger, who shows the last wrangler what it's like to face him on even terms. As Dar collects his belongings, he pauses, looking at Sherak and the two ferrets, who are his eyes and cunning; and now having befriended the tiger, he has great strength as well. He names the tiger Ruh and sets out again.Dar happens across two beautiful young women, one blonde and one brunette, swimming by a waterfall. He's intrigued and is moved to some mischief in order to introduce himself. He sends Kodo and Podo to snatch an outer garment by the riverbank. The brunette (Tanya Roberts) runs in pursuit, but quickly loses sight of them. Suddenly Ruh comes into view and stands in front of the girl, growling. As she stares at the tiger in fear, Dar grabs her from behind, telling her that they might escape if they show no fear. He then uses his mental link to Ruh to tell him to stand down and move out of sight.Dar tells Kiri she owes him her life, but he'll accept 'this as payment,' and then kisses her. The girl trips Dar to the ground and kneels astride him, demanding to know who he is. Dar tells her his name, and that his village of Emir was destroyed by the Juns, and he's following. The girl thinks this is funny, as Dar is alone. Dar manages to roll over on top of her and asks, in turn, who she is. The girl's necklace slips from her neck as Dar rolls over. She tells him that her name is Kiri, and she's a slave to the temple of Ar's priests. Dar is horrified to find whip marks across her back and shoulders, under her garment, but she reminds him again, that she's a slave. She can't run away because the priests will kill her family. She tells Dar that he should continue following the Juns, because they will at least grant him a death more befitting a strong man, than the priests of Ar would.Retrieving Kiri's dropped necklace, Dar decides to follow her, but he's given her too much of a head start. As he looks around, trying to pick up her trail, he catches an ominous sight: a great, dark tree on a high cliff, with several cocoon-like objects hanging from it.Investigating, Dar finds the cocoon-like objects to seemingly be alive. Also hanging from the tree is a cage with a man in it, and before the base of the tree is a bird-like carving and a cauldron filled with a foul liquid. When a human head suddenly floats to the top of the cauldron, Dar turns away with disgust, and finds himself looking at several humanoids with only eyes, but no noses, mouths, or ears on their heads, and great bat-like wings wrapped around themselves.Dar draws his sword and breaks open the cage, freeing the prisoner, who tries to flee. One of the bat-bird-men unfolds its wings and envelops the prisoner. The man gives horrible muffled screams as a foul liquid pools at the creature's feet. The creature unfolds and opens its wings, and the prisoner's bones, stripped clean of all organic matter, tumble to the ground. Silently the bat-bird-men advance on Dar and Ruh, as Dar holds his sword at the ready. But as Sherak descends and lands on Dar's outstretched wrist, the bird-creatures retreat quickly. They revere birds as gods, and to see an eagle having befriended Dar means he is protected by their gods. Still wary, Dar starts to leave. One of the bird-creatures gives Dar a medallion with a bird symbol on it.Morning comes, and Dar awakens from sleep. Sherak lands nearby with a squawk. Dar understands the eagle sees something, and goes to look; he's arrived at the city of Aruk.The road into Aruk is lined with wooden poles from which hang dessicated humanoid corpses. Dar looks around with a grim expression, and tells Ruh to stay out of sight.The bridge is extended over the city moat, which is filled with tar instead of water. The gate is up. Dar enters the city and finds the streets all but deserted. He finds a robe hung outside one of the huts and dons it. Alerted to the sound of shouting, he makes his way to the great ziggurat which serves as the Temple of Ar.Maax has usurped control of the city and keeps the people in line through fear. He performs regular child sacrifices, that Ar be appeased and continue to protect the city. Dar watches in disgust as Maax holds aloft a baby boy, and casts it into a burning fire at the top of the ziggurat, as the townspeople bow their heads fearfully.Maax announces that Ar is not yet satisfied, and that another child must be sacrificed. He points, and his priests seize a baby girl as town guards restrain her parents, who scream and weep in protest. Dar pushes his way to the front of the crowd until he reaches the perimeter of soldiers, who bar him from moving further. As the girl is carried to the top of the ziggurat, Dar sees a number of slave girls standing along the steps of the ziggurat; Kiri is among them.Sherak circles the sky high above the city as Maax lifts the baby girl and makes offers of sacrifice to Ar. Dar lowers the hood of his robe and concentrates. Maax places the girl into the slope that leads down into the flames. But as the baby girl slides inexorably toward her death, Sherak swoops from the skies with a majestic cry, seizes the child in its talons and flies off with her. All of the townspeople prostrate themselves on the ground in awe, except for Dar. Kiri starts to fall to her knees when she sees Dar and looks at him in wonder.Maax notices, and looks at Dar intently. He doesn't recognize Dar for who he is, but he does understand that he controlled the great eagle. Maax watches the eagle carry the baby girl, and then looks back to where Dar was standing-- but Dar is no longer there. Looking to save face for himself, Maax points after the bird and shouts to the townspeople that Ar has spoken personally to them, saying he wants their children.Nighttime in Aruk. Dar holds a large, bulging sack, and holds Kodo over it, letting the ferret sniff the sack. Dar then sets Kodo on the ground, and it begins to scamper from house to house, looking for more traces of the same scent.The father of the baby girl sits forlornly in his house when there's a knock at the door. His dread turns to curiosity at the sight of Dar, and then to overjoy as Dar produces his daughter from the sack. The father, Sacco (Ralph Strait), pledges his gratitude and service to Dar, offering him anything.Dar decides to ask Sacco about Kiri, though he doesn't say her name; only that she is a friend. Sacco asks Dar into the house, saying he should at least have a meal. At the table, Sacco tells Dar Aruk's story: most of the young men in the city were slain by the Jun horde, which is how Maax overthrew Zed. The king is now imprisoned within the ziggurat while Maax and his witchwomen sit in the seat of power. The remaining townspeople are bred by the Jun priests so their children can be sacrificed by Maax.Dar asks Sacco again about the slave girl, and Sacco says they've been taken back to the temple to prepare them for their own deaths. The Jun horde has gone north, but Maax promises they will return. Thanking Sacco for the meal, Dar assures him that he and his family will see Dar again.Maax's witchwomen have crafted a magical ring for the Jun priests. Maax tells them to find this man, this 'master of the beasts,' and that the ring will lead them to him.Dar and Ruh are tracking the slave girls when Ruh finds a spring trickling from a tree. Taking a drink from the tree, Dar sends Ruh ahead to scout. Hiding in the tree is one of the Jun priests. The stone in the ring is actually the closed lid of an eye. The eye opens and looks on Dar, and Maax and the witchwomen can see what the eye sees, in their cauldron. The eye falls on the mark on Dar's hand, and Maax realizes the man is Zed's son. He tells the priest to kill Dar immediately.The priest snares Dar around the neck with a leather loop as the other priest, on horseback, approaches to kill Dar. But Ruh is also in the tree, above and behind the priest holding the noose. Ruh ambushes the priest, taking him down and killing him. The mounted priest takes off, and Ruh gives pursuit... and falls into a covered pit that the priests prepared for Dar.The priest aims his crossbow to kill Ruh, when he's whacked from behind by a stout wooden staff. Standing there is Seth, with a young boy in his late pre-teens. The priest tries to snare Seth, who blocks the snare with his staff, and knocks the priest into the pit, where he is killed by Ruh. Seth remarks that to face a beast on its own terms, man finds he is not so strong.Dar arrives, and draws his sword at the sight of Seth and the boy, though he does not move to attack. Hearing Ruh roaring, he moves to the pit and looks, seeing Seth saved Ruh rather than trapped him. Voicing his gratitude, Dar moves to a large log, trying unsuccessfully to tip it down into the pit so Ruh can use it to climb out. Seth and the boy help him in this task. Seth introduces himself and his companion, Tal (Joshua Milrad) as 'pilgrims' on their way to worship at the temple of Ar. Understanding what Seth means by worshipping, Dar says he is also on his way to the temple for the same purpose. Seth invites Dar to travel with him and Tal.Over a campfire, Seth tells Dar how he and Tal have spent three years, since fleeing Aruk, trying to raise an army to fight the Juns. As long as Zed lives, he still remains a symbol of hope for those trying to live free of Maax's tyranny. Tal is Zed's son, and meant to free Zed from imprisonment, and one day take the throne. Dar tells how he's always had an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, see through their eyes and hear their thoughts, as they can likewise do with him.Dar lets Tal hold Kodo and Podo, and empties out his pouch, explaining how they steal anything they find of value. Tal picks up the Jun priest's eye-ring, not knowing what it is, and Dar, also unknowing, tells him he can keep it. But also among the items is Kiri's necklace. They see it, and Seth's demeanor turns stern as he demands to know where Dar found it. Despite Seth's protests, Dar insists it came from a slave girl, and Dar is trying to rescue her before she's put to death at the temple. Seth sternly says they leave at dawn, before walking away. Tal and Seth know Kiri-- she's Tal's cousin.At dawn, Dar awakens from sleep and sends Sherak to scout. Dar crouches by a campfire, seeing all that Sherak sees. Tal and Seth awaken and understand what Dar is doing. Through Sherak's eyes, Dar sees five women in white robes surrounded by priests in red. Seth knows this means the slave girls are prepared as sacrifices. He says they must make plans in order to rescue the slave girls.Seth and Dar hijack a barge that the priests must use to cross a great lake. When one of the priests knocks Kiri down after she stumbles, and she kicks him in the groin, the priest grabs her head and pushes it under the water. Dar and Seth ambush the priests, capturing them and rescuing the slave girls. As they begin to depart, more priests arrive, firing crossbows, and Seth realizes the barge is now too heavy to get away. Kiri kicks the prisoner priests overboard and they escape. With a little 'coaxing' from Kiri, Dar agrees to help free Zed. As they begin traveling over land back toward Aruk, Seth sets out to find and rally as many people as he can find, to overthrow Maax and free Aruk. Dar, Tal and Kiri are to meet him in the Taran Valley in two nights.Night time over Aruk; Sacco steps outside his hut and sees Sherak perched nearby. Sacco frets and mutters to himself, protesting that he's a coward. But he knows and still respects his vow to Dar, and rides out in his wagon to smuggle Dar, Tal and Kiri past the guards, into the city. But the eye-ring on Tal's hand reveals their presence to Maax, who decides to prepare a welcome.Sacco tells Dar and Kiri that he'll wait for them on the ziggurat's north side. Tal, Ruh, and the ferrets go with Dar and Kiri into the temple. As Ruh scouts ahead, Dar leads the way through a corridor that looks like a potential trap; along both sides of the wall near the floor, are grated openings into some kind of prison chambers. Dar thinks he sees the glowing of bestial eyes from through the grates. Suddenly, with guttural bestial growls, numerous appendages-- or perhaps humanoid limbs-- encased in leather and wicked steel spikes, thrust through the grates, swiping madly at Dar. Seizing a chain that runs the length of the corridor from the ceiling, Dar manages to cross to the other side, safely out of reach. On the other side is a lever that, when pulled, shuts the grated openings so that Kiri and Tal can cross through as well. Tal tells Dar that those were Death Guards, a monstrosity created by Maax's priests, which explains why there were no soldiers or other guards out front.Pressing forward, they find a grate in the floor of one corridor; Kiri says that the chamber below has the keys to the dungeon cells. In the chamber, Jun Priests are in the process of preparing another death guard. Tal explains how a human man is made into a mindless monster through torture. First, the priests encase his limbs in spiked leather sheaths; spikes capable of ripping a man to pieces. Then a foul green liquid and green leeches are put into his ear canal to severely damage his brain. Finally his head is placed into a hardened leather hood with a frightening visage on the front. Stripped of all thought and reason, a death guard will mindlessly kill anything it sees; anything that moves.As Tal explains the procedure, Kiri quietly goes into a side corridor and turns a wall torch. A portion of the wall opens up into a chamber looking like a hidden armory.Tal sees where the cell keys are; Dar says that stealing is best left to thieves. He places Kodo and Podo in a loop of string, and lowers them carefully through the grate down to steal the keys. But just as the ferrets reach the keys, one priest happens to turn, and sees them.But that's the least of the problems; the death guard awakens, bursts its restraints and slaughters the priests. Its spikes snap the string, causing Kodo and Podo to drop to the floor of the cell. They are able to grab the keys and run into an air vent beside the door, but the death guard breaks the door down and madly pursues the little beasts.Despite Dar's clear concern, he assures Tal that Kodo and Podo are fast and cunning, and can handle themselves. They need to proceed with the rescue.Kiri emerges from the armory, now wearing leather boots and a leather girdle with a dagger tucked into it. Tal explains to Dar what Kiri truly is; a Trov warrior, an ancient sect of protectors for Aruk. The ziggurat used to be their home. Kiri is a skilled tracker, and can find the cell where Zed is imprisoned.Arriving at the cell, they find it unlocked. As Kiri and Tal enter the cell, Dar turns; he senses that Ruh has caught up to them, but hasn't come into sight yet. He cautiously starts toward an intersection... nearly walking into an ambush; when in fact it is the ambushing priest that is about to get ambushed, by Ruh, who kills him. Satisfied, Dar hurries back to the cell where Kiri and Tal are tending to Zed. Zed is now old, gray, haggard and feeble... and blinded by Maax's priests.The door to the cell suddenly closes; through the small grate in the door, Maax and one of the witchwomen are visible. The witch assures Maax that Dar is the one of whom the prophecy spoke, and Maax decrees they will all be sacrificed in the morning. Ruh comes charging down the corridor, and Maax and the witchwoman hurriedly enter the cell, closing the door behind them to keep Ruh out. Maax orders the witchwoman to kill Dar.Dar draws his sword and squares off with the witchwoman, who flicks her fingers and makes a flash that blinds Dar. Tal runs at Maax and tries to hit him with his fists, but the youth is still not grown or strong enough to hurt him. Maax pulls a knife and holds it at Tal's throat to keep Kiri at bay.Hissing malevolently, the witchwoman backs against the wall and begins to slither up it, and onto the ceiling, preparing to drop down on Dar from above. But Ruh can still see through the grate, and while Dar is still blinded, he can see through Ruh's eyes. He thrusts his sword straight up and then turns in a half-circle, killing the witchwoman.In the distraction, Kiri pulls a slim silver chain from a wrist bracer and snares Maax's knife hand, forcing him to drop the knife. Ruh breaks down the cell door and advances threateningly on the high priest, roaring. Knowing he cannot face down the mighty beast while alone and unarmed, Maax drops down into a hidden back corridor and escapes while Tal tends to Zed. The old king is coming to; he's still alive, still aware, and he assures Dar he can walk.Meanwhile, the death guard continues its pursuit of Kodo and Podo. The clever ferrets run through old pipes along the walls, but the death guard is relentless; when they run underneath a gap at the bottom of a closed door, the death guard simply smashes it apart.Kiri leads the group to a chamber at the bottom of the ziggurat. Tal turns a lever that lifts a heavy stone carved into a skull shape, that conceals a stairway out of the temple. Dar tells Ruh to go first, and to protect Tal, Zed and Kiri while he covers their escape. Kiri begs Dar to come with them, as the stairway is the only means of escaping the city, but Dar says he can't leave without Kodo and Podo.Alerted to the sound of banging, Dar returns to the door. Half a dozen Jun priests with long knives are searching for him. Seeing him peering through the door, they charge at him with bloodthirsty yells. Dar closes and bars the door, and cuts the pulley to drop the skull-stone back over the stairway entrance. This door also happens to be where Kodo and Podo are running toward; still hauling the cell keys with them. They run under the feet of the priests and under a gap in the door, and the priests all turn and scream in terror as they see the death guard running straight toward them.Kiri returns as Dar collects Kodo and Podo. Gathering the rope from the pulley, she tells Dar they can use it to escape via the air shaft. The death guard smashes through the door and mindlessly pursues Dar and Kiri through the shaft. As they climb down the cliffside with the aid of the rope, the death guard swipes madly at the rope with its spike-shod arm. Sherak flies at the death guard, clawing at its hooded head with his talons. The death guard leans too far out of the shaft and plunges to its death.The rope breaks and Dar and Kiri fall-- but Sacco is there, and their fall is broken by the soft hay of his wagon. Sacco snaps the reins for the wagon's horse, spurring it into a run toward the city gates; but Maax has put the gate guards on alert and it is closed. Dar asks if the gate has a counterweight; when Kiri tells him that it does, he puts Kodo and Podo in another loop of string and has Sherak carry them up to the top of the gate tower to gnaw through the heavy ropes that control it, so that it will raise.As the ferrets get to work, Dar and Sacco hear the sounds of monstrous growling. Three death guards are running madly toward them, spurred by a mounted Jun priest wielding a whip. Dar tells Sacco to start full speed for the gate; their only hope is to trust that Kodo and Podo will get it open.The guard in the tower turns and notices Podo gnawing the control ropes. Raising his sword, he takes hold of the ferret's tail and repositions it for a killing blow. Seeing this, Kodo creeps under the guard's skirt and delivers a punishing bite right where it will do the most hurt. Screaming, the guard reflexively brings his sword down, cutting the rope the rest of the way so that the gate's counterweight starts to pull it up. Sacco reaches the gate just as it raises enough so that his wagon can pass through. As they reach the gate, Dar swings his sword and cuts the counterweight rope. The death guards try to slide under the gate, but are not fast enough, and it crushes them all beneath it. Kodo and Podo drop down from the top of the wall into the hay of Sacco's wagon, and he rides off.Everyone is gathered together at the Taran Valley. Seth has put together thirty-five warriors. Zed's spirit is still as strong as ever, but he has become far too single-minded in his desire for vengeance, for his own good. When Dar issues a warning that killing Maax and his priests will only incur the wrath of the Jun horde, and more soldiers are needed to counter this, Zed calls him a freak and shouts that he needs no cowards beside him. Zed's rejection hurts Dar badly, and he leaves the camp with Ruh, a tear rolling down his face. Sitting on a rock, Dar scrawls a rough outline of a circle with a line through it; a symbol of his home village of Emir.Kiri comes up to him, though only for a moment's comfort; she is honor-bound to her duty to Zed, and she cannot speak against or defy her uncle and king. She sadly tells Dar that nobody will oppose Zed after he cast Dar out. Zed is more than just a deposed king; he's still the people's symbol of hope.As Kiri returns to camp, Zed is starting to outline a plan of attack on Aruk to defeat Maax. Tal has dozed off, and the eye-ring on his hand opens. Maax flashes an evil grin as he listens to Zed's attack plan.Seth turns, and notices the open eye in the ring. Maax's grin vanishes as the eye turns toward Seth, and it's clear he sees it and understands what it is. Seth grabs a small stick from the campfire and presses it into the eye, putting it out, before pulling the ring off Tal's hand and tossing it into the campfire. He tells Zed that Maax has overheard the whole conversation and knows the attack plan, and will be prepared. But so utterly single-minded is Zed that he cannot see any turn of events other than total defeat and death for Maax. Seth knows better; it is his forces that will face this fate.Dar awakens in the morning; his animal companions at his side. Looking around, he senses trouble. Getting to higher ground, he sees Sacco riding on a horse, leading another. Dar calls out to Sacco, who tells him that the attack on Maax failed; Zed, Tal, Seth and Kiri were all taken alive, and are set to be sacrificed at the temple of Ar at sunset. Dar quickly mounts the second horse and rides with Sacco back to Aruk.At the temple of Ar, Maax and the last surviving witchwoman stand atop the ziggurat as a wagon brings Seth, Tal, and Kiri. All three are dressed in sacrificial robes; their hands tied with leather strips. Kiri is pulled out of the wagon and dragged up to the top of the ziggurat. Beside the sacrificial fire pit, Zed is tied to a chair. Maax tells the people of Aruk that Zed has defied the will of Ar, and now he and his kin will die.Dar rides into Aruk just as the priests drag Kiri to the top of the ziggurat. The crowd quickly parts as he rides straight for the ziggurat. He tosses his pack into the wagon, and Kodo and Podo dart out, chewing through the leather thongs that bind Tal and Seth. Dar storms the ziggurat, attacking any guards or priests in his way. Sacco and the townspeople throw a sword and staff to Seth and Tal, who join in the battle. Ruh leaps at a guard, who drops his weapon and backs against the wall of the ziggurat, screaming in fear before he is mauled to death.Kiri is thrust down onto the ziggurat as she continues to fight. She bites one priest's hand and starts to break free, before she is clubbed on the head with a sword pommel and knocked out. Maax raises his knife to kill Kiri, but the shouts of the townspeople alert him that Dar is almost at the top of the ziggurat, and all of the townspeople themselves are starting to grapple the guards, wrestling them for their spears. The witchwoman tells Maax that he is doomed; the unborn son has come for him.Maax raises his knife again, but Dar is at the top of the ziggurat, starting to cut through the priests. Maax goes to Zed, holding his knife at the king's chest. Dar finishes all of the priests and swings his sword menacingly in front of Maax. Holding the knife, Maax then reveals to both Zed and Dar that they are father and son; Dar is the unborn child stolen from his mother's womb. His eyes wide, Dar puts his sword down on the floor of the ziggurat roof. But despite this, Maax kills Zed with a rake of his knife through the king's chest, and then lunges at Dar, grappling with him. Fighting his way back to his feet, Dar forces Maax's arms around and down, driving Maax's own knife into his stomach.Retrieving his sword, Dar turns to the last witchwoman, who cowers beside a stone urn. As Dar advances on her, the witchwoman turns away. Dar thrusts his sword at her back, but her cloak is empty; Dar sees a white bird flying away. Dar goes to Kiri, who recovers consciousness and smiles at him. Lifting her in his arms, Dar goes to the edge of the ziggurat's top.Seth, Tal, and the townspeople overpower the remaining guards and rush up the ziggurat in triumph. Maax is overthrown. The townspeople cheer in victory.But in fact, though grievously wounded, Maax is still alive. Pulling the knife from his stomach, he struggles to his feet and staggers toward Dar from behind, intent on killing him.Kodo and Podo have scampered up the ziggurat and reached the top. Maax is almost on top of Dar, who remains unaware of the high priest. Kodo doesn't think twice. Leaping as high as he can, the ferret lands on Maax's shoulder, biting his neck. Maax screams in agony, clutching at Kodo-- and loses his balance, tumbling into the sacrificial fire, taking Kodo with him. Shouting in desperation, Dar darts toward the fire, but cannot reach into it. Kodo is lost. Podo peers sadly into the fire at the loss of its mate before Dar picks the ferret up and holds it against his chest.From his vantage point, Tal sees something on the horizon. A huge dust cloud is moving slowly but inexorably toward Aruk. As Maax had foretold, the Jun horde has returned to Aruk. Seth tells Tal that it's his decision on whether to fight or flee. Tal looks at Dar. Holding Podo close against him, Dar tells the people that it's time to stand and fight.Preparations are made with speed. The bridge is pulled back, and the townspeople furiously shovel dirt over the moat to cover it so that it appears as solid ground. Meanwhile, Dar sits on the steps of the ziggurat. He pulls out the medallion given to him by the bat-bird-men and looks at it. Calling to Sherak, Dar tosses the medallion to the eagle and sends him to the great tree to summon aid.It is night time. The townspeople anxiously wait the arrival of the Juns. As the rumbling of the horde's horses grows louder, Dar mentions to Seth that tar was a rite of manhood and test of strength in Emir. Hopefully the Juns will fail.The Jun horde rides into view, stopping a few dozen yards short of the wall. The people of Aruk and the Jun barbarians stare each other down in a tension filled moment. Then the Jun leader silently raises his massive greatclub and points toward the town, signaling the Juns to attack. The Juns ride forward, slaughter on their minds. Seth's plan pays off as the Juns ride straight into the moat; their horses falling into the tar. The people of Aruk cheer. A lookout just in front of the gate lights a torch and runs to light the moat aflame.But although mired in tar, the Juns are far from down. They begin loosing bolts from their crossbows, taking down the lookout and a sentry perched atop the town gate. Tal runs to the fallen lookout, grabbing his torch, only to be wounded by another crossbow bolt. The wounded sentry manages to release the gate controls to close the gate. Dar and Kiri roll underneath and clear before it closes. As Kiri tends to Tal, a Jun barbarian climbs out of the tar and advances on her, sword raised to cleave her in two. Kiri grabs the torch and thrusts it at the Jun, setting him aflame. Dar runs at the burning barbarian and kicks him back into the tar moat. Sheets of flame roar out across the moat as the tar is ignited. Seth climbs over the gate, joining with Dar and Kiri.More Jun barbarians crawl out of the burning moat; some still riding on horseback. Dar, Kiri and Seth fight with all their fury and strength, taking down several Juns. But still more crawl out of the moat and surround them on all sides, driving the three until they are back to back to back. The Juns fence and poke at them with their swords, looking for openings.The Jun leader spurs his horse, leaping over the burning moat and into the fray. The Jun soldiers part way for him, Pointing his massive greatclub, the Jun leader challenges Dar to single combat. The Jun leader's greatclub has two small blades at the heavy end protruding to either side, and he can detach the pommel to swing the weapon as a flail. He bashes downward and the blade gets stuck in the bridge. Drawing a sword, he picks up the fight. Leaping off the bridge, Dar tackles the Jun leader off his horse and retrieves his sword. Their blades clash and the Jun leader grapples with Dar, slamming him against the bridge so that his sword goes flying, and then throwing him to the ground and retrieving his greatclub. The Jun leader whirls the massive greatclub around by the pommel and chain, again bashing downward, and again one blade lodges in the bridge. Dar stuns the Jun leader with several kicks and grabs the Jun leader's legs, taking them out from under him. As the Jun leader falls, the other blade of his greatclub lodges in his back. The wounded leader struggles to his feet, but Dar looses a swinging round kick to his helmeted head, knocking him down, and then grabs his arm, using it to fling the Jun leader into the flaming tar.Recovering his sword, Dar makes his way back into the circle, back to back to back with Seth and Kiri. The remaining barbarians seem ready to descend on the trio and finish what their fallen leader started. Enough Juns remain that the death of Dar, Kiri and Seth seems certain, no matter how many Juns they take with them.Sherak swoops down, landing on Dar's arm. The rustle of wings signals the arrival of the bat-bird-men. Opening their massive wings, they each envelop a Jun barbarian, devouring their victim. The bat-bird-men rout the remaining Juns; a scant few barbarian survivors fleeing. The leader of the avian humanoids looks at Dar, giving him a small nod before leading his own people back home. The gate is raised and Dar, Seth and Kiri pull a wounded Tal back into the city. The people of Aruk cheer in victory.Some time later, Dar is preparing to leave Aruk. Tal is healing well, although one of his arms will be weak and difficult to use for some time. Dar gives something wrapped in leather to Seth, as a gift to the new king.Seth suddenly grabs Dar's hand, looking closely at the mark there. The brand is a rough likeness of the front face of the temple ziggurat. Having been there when Maax made the pronouncement, Seth knows what the mark means. He tells Dar that he is the rightful king, as firstborn.But Dar has not led a life appropriate to a future ruler. He can't be tied down to a throne. He is sure that Tal will be a great leader, for he already has the best right hand that one could ask for. Dar and Seth clasp forearms in farewell. A number of villagers watch as Dar and Ruh walk side by side toward the gate. As the two pass through the open gate and out of Aruk, Kiri is seen running after Dar.Tal takes the gift Dar left him to the ziggurat temple. Wrapped in the piece of leather is Dar's throwing kapa.Sherak is perched on a totem atop the ziggurat. Seth comes up beside Tal, and the two of them, and Sherak, all look into each other's eyes for a brief moment, before the eagle takes flight again, to rejoin his master.As Dar stands on a high bluff, Kiri comes up behind him. Whether she is bidding him farewell or choosing to go with him is left for the viewer to decide. Kiri kisses Dar passionately as Podo pokes its head out of Dar's belt pouch, sniffing noses with Ruh. Two baby ferrets borne by Podo follow suit. The last shot is Kiri and Dar kissing, from Sherak's birds-eye view as he circles high above."
Missing,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084335/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When an idealistic American writer disappears during the Chilean coup d'état in September 1973, his wife and father try to find him. In September1973, in Chile, the American journalist Charles Horman arrives in Valparaiso with his friend Terry Simon to meet his wife Beth and bring her back to New York with him. However, they are surprised by the military coup d'état sponsored by the US Government to replace President Salvador Allende and Charles is arrested by the military force. His father Ed Horman, a conservative businessman from New York, arrives in Chile to seek out his missing son with Beth. He goes to the American Consulate to meet the Consul that promises the best efforts to find Charles while the skeptical Beth does not trust on the word of the American authorities. The nationalism and confidence of Ed in his government changes when he finds the truth about what happened with his beloved son.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September, 1973. Liberal minded young American couple Charles and Beth Horman - he a writer and translator - live in Santiago, Chile, they who chose Chile because of the comfort they felt in a country matching their own values. Charlie's father back in New York, Ed Horman, a conservative devout Christian Scientist, sees his son, and thus by association Beth, as flaky, directionless and irresponsible. Charlie and Beth's American friend Terry Simon, in the country solely for a visit, and Charlie are caught in Viña del Mar the day the right wing military overthrows the elected left wing government in a coup. At the hotel where Charlie and Terry end up for the night, they encounter US military and government officials. Because of the coup, Charlie and Terry decide to take notes of what they see, including that of the ""unofficial"" American presence in Viña. The day after the start of the coup, Charlie is taking Terry to the airport so that she can get out of the country, when they, learning that the airport is closed, are advised by American freelance reporter Kate Newman to take refuge at a large, American friendly hotel with lots of public visibility because of word that the military is taking away anyone for any reason, many of those who will end up missing never to be seen again, largely nationals but sometimes foreigners. Charlie leaves Terry at a hotel so that he can go home to retrieve Beth. Beth, however, is caught stranded away from home after curfew, and when she is able to get home the following morning, she learns from a neighbor that the soldiers had been to their house, with eyewitnesses later telling Beth that they saw Charlie being taken away. Two weeks later, Ed makes his way to Santiago to help Beth locate Charlie, Ed who had contacted his local politicians for diplomatic assistance in the matter. In Santiago, Charlie's case is largely handled by US Consul Phil Putnam, and US Naval officer Captain Ray Tower. Ed and Beth are often at odds with each other despite their common goal of finding what happened to Charlie: Ed wants Putnam, Tower and any other US official to use whatever clout they may have to assist him, Beth and Charlie - US citizens - while Beth doesn't trust them, especially Tower, for good reason. In the process of the Hormans' investigation, Ed may get a clearer picture of his son, who he would admit he really did not know. As Ed and Beth increasingly seem to be getting the runaround by those who are purportedly trying to help them, they may, with the assistance of others, get closer and closer to the truth, which may turn the world of patriotic Ed on its head forever.—Huggo In 1973, U.S. businessman Ed Horman arrives in Chile to look for his son, Charles, a politically left-leaning journalist who disappeared during a military coup. Charles' wife, Beth, has been looking for some time, but her requests for help from the U.S. consulate have thus far produced few results. As Ed and Beth try to figure out what really happened to Charles, Ed realizes that the American officials may know more than they're telling.—Jwelch5742 Based on the real-life experiences of Ed Horman, this is the story of an American father of conservative background who comes to a South American country to search for his missing son, a journalist. Ed joins with his daughter-in-law Beth, who like her husband is politically polarized from the father, in prying through the bureaucracy and dangerous political intrigue in search of their son and husband. Little by little, the father comes to realize that his own beloved government is not telling him the truth.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>"
The Thing,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A research team in Antarctica is hunted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of its victims. A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They are trying to kill a dog that has escaped from their base. After the destruction of the Norwegian chopper the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it is an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.—grantss During an exploration in Antarctica, a group of researchers come across a Norwegian facility near their research station. They soon come to realize Something horrible happened there. After discovering that the Norwegians had stumbled across something horrific; they leave, but something comes back with them. An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog explodes, eventually leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realizes that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.—Goth <brooks@odie.ee.wits.ac.za> In the midst of the Antartican snowfield, the scientists and workers of a small American research base are shocked when a helicopter begins to circle their camp, chasing and shooting at a dog. When the helicopter is destroyed and the passengers are killed, the dog is let into the base and the Americans begin to wonder what has actually happened. The helicopter has Norwegian markings, must be from the Norwegian base not too far from their own. A team of Americans are sent to the Norwegian base and find out what has happened. On arrival, they find that the place has been totally destroyed. They also discover a mangled body that looks as though it was once that of a person, which they bring back with them for further study. It is only then that the clues begin to add up; the dog morphs horribly into a strange creature that attacks the researchers. They manage to fight it off, but they come to a terrible conclusion: an alien with the power to transform and take the appearance of anybody else is amongst them. Who is infected already, and who can be trusted? Helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady sets out to find the answers to exactly that.—Tomius J. Barnard In the opening shot, an alien spaceship flies through space and enters Earth's atmosphere near Antarctica. Whether or not the ship crashes or lands on Earth is unknown.In Antarctica, during the winter of 1982, a helicopter flies hurriedly after a husky. The man riding next to the pilot shoots a rifle and drops grenades hoping to kill the dog. The dog runs toward an American research base, Outpost 31, where a 12-man research crew is getting ready for the upcoming winter. The helicopter, which they see is from a Norwegian research base, flies in and lands. The Americans watch puzzled as two men emerge from the helicopter jabbering frantically in their native language. One of them pulls the pin on a grenade but clumsily throws it behind him. As the pilot frantically tries to find it in the snow, it explodes, killing him and taking the helicopter with it. The other man continues shooting his rifle hysterically and talking frantically; no one can understand what he is saying and the man shoots Bennings (Peter Maloney) in his left leg. The camp leader Garry (Donald Moffat) shoots and kills the gibbering man in defense.Puzzled about why the Norwegians were trying to kill the dog, MacReady (Kurt Russell) the team's helicopter pilot and their doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart) go to investigate the Norwegian base. The whole base has been gutted by fire and explosions as there are holes in several of the walls in the interior of the complex. There is also a fire ax stuck into one of the walls. Everyone is dead; one of them had barricaded himself in the radio room and is still sitting frozen in his chair, his wrists and throat slit in an apparent suicide. Mac and Copper explore further, finding a large and empty block of ice. Outside in the snow, along with one or two burned human bodies, Mac and Copper find the burnt and frozen corpse of a twisted creature, not man but not beast, either. They bring it back to their own base for examination. An autopsy performed by biologist Blair reveals nothing more than a normal set of internal organs despite a deformed, distorted exterior.That night, the new stray husky is locked in a kennel with the team's sled dogs. The other dogs soon react with fear to the new addition, growling and snarling. The new dog suddenly transforms into a hideous creature with tentacles and crab's legs and starts attacking the other dogs. The incident is discovered by dog handler Clark (Richard Masur), who watches horrified. Mac hears the sounds of the thing's unworldly groan and the cries of the other dogs; and he immediately responds by sounding the fire alarm, waking up the entire camp who converge on the kennel where they see the hideous dog-like creature seemingly consuming the other sled dogs. Part of the creature separates from the rest and pulls itself up through the ceiling. After shooting at the beast with their guns, the 'thing' is burned with a flamethrower.An autopsy done by Blair on the thing's remains reveals its secret: the ""thing"" is an alien organism that imitates other life forms by attacking, and either digesting or dissolving them and reshaping its image to appear in the animal or person it kills. The team also watches a videotape of the Norwegian team working at a remote location, forming a circle around an object in the ice and using Thermite charges to uncover it.The following day, MacReady flies with Palmer and Norris to the site where the Norwegians were working. They find an alien spaceship in the open crater and rappel down to look around. Mac asks Norris how long the ship has been entombed; Norris estimates that it's been there for at least 100,000 years. Up above the crash site, they find a block of the ice cap missing where the thing was discovered and removed by the Norwegians. Back at Outpost 31, Mac theorizes that the Norwegians awakened the creature after thawing its ice block and it immediately began to attack them.That evening, Blair studies cells from the Thing, and watches them attack and replicate other kinds of cells on his computer. Typing his report into his computer, the computer replies that the possibility that one or more team members may be infected by the alien organism is 75%, and that if the alien reached civilization, the Earth's population will be infected and taken over by the alien organism 27,000 hours (around 37 months, just over 3 years) after first contact.The team decides to place the creature's remains in a storage room. The assistant biologist Fuchs (Joel Polis) asks to speak privately with Mac; he tells Mac that he's been looking through Blair's (Wilford Brimley) notes and found that Blair believes the organism's cells are still alive and active in the burned remains of both creatures. Blair has also theorized that the alien might have imitated a thousand other lifeforms across space.While Windows (Thomas G. Waites) and Bennings prepare the room to store the remains recovered from the Norwegian base, it begins to move under the blanket it's been covered with. Windows returns to the room to find Bennings being attacked, wrapped in tentacles. Windows gets the other team members but Bennings has escaped through the storage room window. They find him in the snow, his transformation by the alien nearly complete except for his hands, which are hideously large and grotesque shapes. Mac and the team incinerate him alive and then burn the remains of the two other creatures along with him.Realizing that something like this could take over the world if it got out, Blair seemingly loses his mind, killing the surviving sled dogs and destroying the helicopter and the communications equipment (injuring Windows in the process), trapping the crew without hope of rescue. The others, seeing him as a threat, subdue him, lock him in the camp's tool shed and sedate him.The next morning, fear and paranoia circulates around the camp as nobody knows who may be the thing or who isn't. Doc Copper suggests that he develop a blood serum test to see who might be infected. Copper finds that the blood bags in the lab have been slashed open, making their contents useless. Copper believes that someone deliberately destroyed the blood to prevent the test from happening. Gary and Copper become suspects because of their access to the blood storage while Clark is regarded with suspicion because of his proximity to the imitation dog. All three are quarantined by MacReady who takes over as the 'de facto' leader of the team to find out who may be the Thing. When a 'whiteout' storm (an Antarctic storm resembling a winter hurricane) hits the camp and the outside temperature drops severely, they are forced to hunker down, all of them continuing to be paranoid and distrustful of one another. Mac talks to Fuchs, who only has a few weak theories from Blair's notes. Fuchs recommends that everyone prepares their own meals and eat only out of cans.The following evening, Fuchs, trying to do research on how the Thing can reproduce and multiply, is waylaid when one of the unseen infected persons disables the power to the lab. In going after it, Fuchs is killed (off-camera) and his charred body is found outside in the snow a few hours later by Mac, Nauls and Windows. Either the Thing burned Fuchs to death, or Fuchs burned himself in a suicide to prevent him from being taken over. Mac tells Windows to return to the main building while he goes with Nauls to his shack to investigate: when he left two days before, he'd turned out the lights and they're back on.Some time later, Nauls returns to the camp, nearly collapsing because of the cold. He tells the others he'd found ragged and dirty clothing with Mac's name on it in the oil furnace inside MacReady's shack. As they were struggling back to the main compound, Nauls cut Mac's safety line and made a break for it. Mac is locked outside and breaks the window in a storeroom to enter. He arms himself with a small bundle of dynamite and threatens to blow himself and the rest of them up if they don't back away. When Childs (Keith David) and the others rebel against MacReady (and to express their suspicion that he may be the Thing), Norris collapses when he appears to have a heart attack. When Dr. Copper tries to revive him using defibrillator paddles, Norris' chest suddenly opens up into a monstrous mouth and bites off Copper's arms. MacReady uses a flamethrower to destroy the Norris/Thing, leaving only it's head, which detaches, sprouts spider-like legs and tries to crawl away before it is destroyed as well.At this point, MacReady leads the others in a test to determine who is infected. He suggests that everyone give a blood sample, and then those blood samples be poked with a hot piece of wire. The theory is that each part of a Thing will try to survive independently, and therefore the blood would transform to defend itself. Clark makes an attempt on MacReady's life with a scalpel; he is shot and killed by McCready. Everyone is tied up (including the dead Clark and Copper) while the test is performed. Windows is the first to be tested, and turns out to be human; MacReady arms him with another flamethrower to torch anyone who might be a Thing. As MacReady continues the test (testing the dead bodies of Clark and Copper, whom are not infected), he openly accuses Garry of being a duplicate, but instead finds that Palmer (David Clennon) is a Thing clone. As Palmer transforms, MacReady's flamethrower misfires and Windows hesitates to kill the Palmer-Thing. The Palmer-Thing's entire head splits open and turns into a giant mouth, biting Windows' head. MacReady manages to get his flamethrower working and sets the Palmer-Thing on fire which crashes through the wall to die in the snow, which MacReady then blows up with a stick of dynamite. MacReady is then forced to torch Windows with the other flame thrower, since he is now infected and the Thing is assimilating his body.MacReady and the three remaining survivors, Childs, Garry, and Nauls (T.K. Carter) are revealed to be not infected. While ordering Childs to stay behind to watch the camp, MacReady, Garry and Nauls go to check on Blair to give him the blood test, and discover the shed empty; Blair had escaped through the floor and was secretly building a small spacecraft in the tunnels under the camp. They are confused when they see Child's running off into the storm, but at that moment, the compound's power suddenly turns off. It is then they realize that Blair is the last Thing creature and that it wants to freeze into hibernation until the rescue team finds it since it has no way out. Finally, realizing how pervasive the infection is and that there is little chance for survival, it is proposed that they blow up the base to prevent the Thing from freezing again. MacReady, Nauls and Garry begin setting fire to the complex with Molotov cocktails.In venturing down into the basement of the camp to set TNT charges, Garry is killed by the infected Blair. Nauls disappears and is never seen again. MacReady comes face-to-face with the huge, tentacle Blair/Thing, which destroys his detonator. In a last-ditch effort, MacReady throws a lighted stick of dynamite at it. Both the Thing and the rest of the compound explode, but MacReady survives. He stumbles to his ruined shack to find Childs there, who claims he had seen Blair and had gotten lost in the storm running after him. Neither of them know whether the other is the Thing, and they both sit ready opposite and facing each other, ready to kill the other at the first sign. (MacReady is definitely not the Thing, but there is a strong possibility that Childs might have been taken over when he wandered off earlier). They take swigs from a bottle of whiskey as the camera shows a wide shot of the camp in flames. Both men, exhausted and wary of each other, sit among the burning wreckage.... waiting for the fires to go out and the winter weather to consume them. On that dark note, along with a wiry laugh from MacReady, 'The Thing' comes to a close."
The Entity,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082334/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman is tormented and sexually molested by an invisible demon. As if struggling to make ends meet and trying to get her life back on track wasn't enough, Carla Moran, a hard-working single mother of three, finds herself with the back to the wall when faced with an inexplicable supernatural incident. Now, Carla is having a hard time telling the difference between fact and fantasy, unable to find logical explanations. For instance, how on earth has the unseen assailant managed to break into her secured, locked-up home? Nevertheless, the painful bruises in hard-to-reach parts of Carla's body don't lie. And--as all attempts with psychotherapy failed, and the late-night paranormal attacks become increasingly violent--desperate Carla has no other choice but to turn to a team of parapsychologists who offer, at least, hope for a resolution. However, is there an escape from abstract evil? Above all, can Carla beat the Entity?—Nick Riganas Carla Moran awakens one night to find herself being beaten and raped by an unseen presence. Terrified of what's happening to her, and shunned by friends and family who think she's lost her mind, she seeks help from parapsychologists. The researchers soon discover that evil spiritual force has been drawn to Carla and is responsible for the violent attacks. The question now, however, is how do they stop it? Based on a supposedly true story.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> The movie begins as single mother Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey) is violently raped in her home by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her friend Cindy (Margaret Blye).They return to Carla's home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman (Ron Silver) and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes she has inflicted them on herself (despite the marks showing up in places impossible for her to reach). We learn that Carla suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual and physical abuse, teenage pregnancy and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma.Another night later, Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken. Dr. Sneiderman urges her to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses.After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home. During their study, Dr. Sneiderman arrives and confronts Carla, trying to convince her that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him.Reassured that her case is being taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend Jerry (Alex Rocco) visits and she suffers a particularly disturbing sexual attack, which he witnesses. Jerry leaves her bedroom briefly only to return and find Carla nude and pinned to the bed by an unseen force. Her breasts are pulsating rhythmically, as if being massaged by unseen hands, while she begs him for help. Hearing the commotion, Carlas son enters the room and believes that Jerry is harming her, prompting him to attack Jerry. Later at the hospital, Jerry is so troubled by what he saw that he ends their relationship.Desperate for a solution to her problem, Carla agrees to participate in an elaborate experiment carried out by the parapsychologists. A full mock-up of her home is created to lure the entity into a trap. Liquid helium will be used to freeze the entity, once inside. They presume that since the being can manipulate physical things, it must have physical mass, and therefore can be frozen. Before the experiment can begin, Dr. Sneiderman unsuccessfully tries to convince Carla to leave. The entity arrives but unexpectedly takes control of the liquid helium jets and uses them against Carla. She defiantly stands up to it, stating that it can never have her. Dr. Sneiderman rushes in and saves her. As they look back, they see the entity frozen for a brief period into a very large mass of ice. It eventually breaks free and vanishes.In the final scene, Carla returns to her house the next day. The front door slams by itself and she is greeted by a demonic voice. She calmly opens the door, exits the house, gets in a car with her family and leaves.A closing disclaimer verifies that Carla and her family have moved to Texas where Carla still experiences supernatural occurrences, but is no longer raped by the being."

Monsignor,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084351/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ambitious priest seduces a nun and leads the Vatican into shady business during and after World War II. John Flaherty is a young and ambitious American priest who arrives in the Papal sovereign city state of the Vatican in 1944 to take his holy orders as a Catholic priest. After distinguishing himself in combat in the World War II battlefields of northern Italy, he's assigned as the Vatican treasurer. With the Vatican strapped for money during the war, Flaherty soon makes illegal business deals with a corrupt U.S. Army sergeant named Varese, who deals goods on the local black market, which is connected to a ruthless Sicilian mobster named Don Appolini. Appolini agrees to fund Flaherty's operation for profit through his Swiss bank connections. Flaherty's mentor, Cardinal Santoni, the secretary to the elderly but powerful Pope, learns of Flaherty's business deals, but covers for Flaherty in order for them to rise in the ranks of the church against Santoni's rival, Cardinal Vinci. But Flaherty's double life as a black marketeer and priest takes a turn when he falls in love with a young French nun, named Clara, who knows of his dealings, but not of his true identity in the Catholic Church.—Anonymous Opening in the year 1943, inside an American Catholic church, John Flaherty (Christopher Reeve) is ordained as a priest and is included among a group of young men who will soon depart to serve as Army chaplains in Europe during World War II. In his first act as a priest, Flaherty officiates a Catholic marriage ceremony for his childhood friend, Lodo Varese (Joe Cortese), and dances with the maid of honor (Ritza Brown). The bride's father (Joe Spinell), compliments Flaherty's devotion, but quietly disapproves of him socializing with any woman.Some months later, in the war-torn Italian countryside, Flaherty crawls toward dying soldier, Musso (Joe Pantoliano), and blesses his soul for passage into heaven. After the man dies, Flaherty shakily grabs a .50 caliber machine gun and shoots at an incoming line of enemy German soldiers, stopping the attack.Another few months later, Flaherty is informed that he has been summoned to Vatican City in Rome, Italy. There, he meets Bishop Walkman (Robert J. Prosky), the liaison officer between the Vatican and the U.S. Army, who cites Flaherty's college education in accounting and hires him to work as the Vatican's financial advisor. Walkman advises the young priest to use his charming personality to his advantage, but to keep his head down and follow orders.The next day, Flaherty meets with Cardinal Secretary Santoni (Fernando Rey). Santoni, who holds out his hand for Flaherty to kiss his ring. Flaherty shakes his hand instead, explaining that he is unworthy because he sinned while committing murder on the battlefield. Impressed with the young man, Santoni extends his hand again, and this time, Flaherty kisses the jeweled finger.Three months later, Flaherty has his own office and Bishop Walkman instructs him to stay at Vatican after the news of the war being over in May 1945 arrives in Rome. When a cleric announces that Varese has arrived at the Vatican, Flaherty embraces his friend, relieved to find him returned from the battlefield alive. Varese drives Flaherty in his jeep to an army storeroom containing piles of supplies, many from the Vatican commissary, and explains that he sells them in black market dealings with the local Mafia.Later, Flaherty convinces Santoni to ease the Vatican's debt by cheaply purchasing the Vatican's supplies from American commissaries and then selling them for profit. He claims that the donations will help the church while diverting money from Italy's criminals. Although Santoni worries that the arrangement could hurt the Church's image, Flaherty offers to take full responsibility, and Santoni grants him complete control of the commissary. After Santoni adorns Flaherty with a pectoral cross, Flaherty bounds out of the office and runs into Cardinal Vinci (Adolfo Celi), who congratulates the priest on his achievements but reminds him of the power of choice. In the supply room, Varese warns his friend that the Mafioso, Don Appolini (Jason Miller), is a dangerous man.Together, they travel to Appolini's home in Sicily, where Flaherty proposes to sell him the Vatican's unused American cigarettes. The Mafia boss, however, refuses to get involved in a scheme that steals from the church. After mass that afternoon, Appolini reconsiders the deal and offers to split the profits, with Varese heading the operation. Removing the crucifix pins from his army uniform, Flaherty urges Appolini to call him ""Finnigan"" for all business dealings, and receives a briefcase containing $50,000.On the rainy drive back from Appolini's house, the two friends pick up a French nun and her students. Flaherty takes a liking to a postulate named Clara (Geneviève Bujold), and tells her his name is Lieutenant Finnigan. Once in Rome, he returns to the Vatican and presents Santoni with the cash.The following week, Flaherty, dressed in his military outfit, finds Clara wandering in the ruins of the Roman Forum, and arranges to meet with her in an ecclesiastical bookstore later that day. Meanwhile, a priest claims to have seen Flaherty consorting with Varese in the black market, and reports him to Vinci and Santoni. Santoni agrees to promote the cleric, putting him in a post that will keep him from investigating further.That evening, Flaherty brings Clara to the bedroom attached to Varese's supply room. Swallowing a glass of champagne, Flaherty kisses her; before they make love, she admits that she has been a postulate for two years because the sisters doubt her commitment. Later, Flaherty confesses his carnal sins to a cardinal, revealing his priesthood and his romantic feelings for Clara.Over dinner with Appolini, Flaherty proposes to use Appolini's Swiss bank account to open legitimate businesses that will covertly support the Vatican's finances after the war. One afternoon, on a rooftop terrace, Clara and Flaherty confess their love for one another, but Clara suspects that Flaherty is keeping his true identity hidden.While participating in a ceremony for the Pope (Leonardo Cimino), Clara catches sight of Flaherty in his clerical robes and they lock eyes across the chapel. After Flaherty is appointed as monsignor, she scorns him for his deception and proclaims she will never forgive him, and thus walks out on him forever. Varese and the heartbroken Flaherty drunkenly cavort with prostitutes when Appolini barges in and instructs Varese to clean up his act. Feeling as if he has lost his way, Flaherty gives his necklace to Father Francisco (Tomas Milian), but Francisco insists that God will never lose faith in him.The film skips forward several years later in the 1950s. Flaherty has become a cardinal, but under his alias Mr. Finnigan, he continues to do business deals when out of his red clerical robe.

Mrs. Brisby, a widowed mouse, lives in a cinder block with her children on the Fitzgibbon farm. She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, but her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. She visits the rats and meets Nicodemus, the wise, mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, plot to kill Nicodemus during the move.—MIss Victoria Living in secret on a farm near the N.I.M.H. research facility, Mrs. Brisby must save her family before the farmers destroy their home.

In her quest for a cure she frees a young crow from some string in which he has foolishly tied himself, at the mercy of the farmer's cat Dragon. In return for her risking her life to save his, he takes her to the creature all birds know is the wisest: a great owl. Owls eat mice, but when this owl learns Mrs. Brisby's name he sets her on a path to earning a noble solution to her predicament, which is the secret of NIMH.—Anonymous A fieldmouse named Mrs. Brisby must move her family to a safe location before the farmer plows the field where they live, but her invalid son Timmy cannot go outside due to his pneumonia. She enlists the aid of some highly-intelligent, escaped lab rats that have built a subterranean society inside a rose bush near the farmer's garden. The rats, led by the wise Nicodemus, decide to help her physically move her house to repay a debt of gratitude to her late husband, who made possible the rats' escape from the laboratory. Then some of the rats decide to use the situation to kill Nicodemus and make it look accidental.—Gibborino Mrs. Brisby (Frisby in the original book) is a very shy, timid, and lonely mouse widow whose family is threatened by a premature warm spell, prompting the farmer to start his mowing early, endangering the cinder block she and her family call home.

With the push of her local confidante, the Shrew, and the aid of a clumsy, love lorn crow named Jeremy, she goes to see the Great Owl, who, upon learning that she is the widow of a mouse named Jonathan Brisby, advises her to seek the aid of the mysterious rats who live in the rosebush outside the farmer's house. There, Mrs. Brisby learns of her deceased husband's past, and the secret of these rats, the Rats of NIMH, who agree to move her home before they abandon their underground colony for Thorn Valley, but Mrs. Brisby herself is endangered by the evil machinations of Jenner, a power hungry rat who seeks to overthrow the rats' leader Nicodemus so as to keep the rats in their underground colony, and will go so far as to endanger Mrs. Brisby's children to achieve his goals. Only Justin, the rats' gallant, Errol Flynn like captain of the guard, stands between Jenner and Mrs. Brisby, who must call upon the same courage her husband had if she is to save her family.=====================================================Mrs Brisby is a widowed mouse who lives on a farm owned by a man named Fitzgibbons. She and her 4 children, Martin, Theresa, Cynthia and Timmy live in a cinderblock in one of Fitzgibbons' fields. Every year, before Fitzgibbons plows the field to plant his crops, the family moves to their summer home to avoid the tractor. Nearby is another mouse, Dr Ages, who is the family doctor. Brisby visits Ages to get a remedy for Timmy, who has come down with pneumonia, potentially delaying the summer move.Fitzgibbons decides one day to begin plowing the field early. Brisby desperately tries to disable the farmer's tractor and freezes while climbing up the mechanism. Auntie Shrew intervenes and pulls out the tractor's gas line, halting the machine. While Mrs Brisby sobs over her predicament, Auntie tells her to be braver for her family's sake and suggests she visit the Great Owl, the wisest creature in the forest. Brisby is hesitant, since owls eat mice, but she goes.With the help of a new found friend, Jeremy, a crow hoping to meet Miss Right, and whom Mrs Brisby untangled from a pile of string he was trapped in, she meets with the fearsome owl, who merely tells her that she must move her family. Mrs Brisby explains the complication with her son Timmy and the owl tells her he has no solution. As he leaves, he learns her last name and becomes more helpful because her husband, Jonathan, was well known and respected throughout the woods. The Owl tells Mrs Brisby to go to the colony of rats that live in the farmer's rose bush and ask them for help. He specifically tells her to have the rats move her house to ""the lee of the stone"", the protected side of a large rock in the field that Fitzgibbons avoids when plowing.Mrs Brisby sneaks into the rose bush and finds that the rats have built a very modern colony that makes use of electricity that they pilfer from Fitzgibbons. She also meets Dr Ages there, whom at first tells her the rose bush is off-limits but is astonished that she had met with the Great Owl and lived. They are discovered by the rats' captain of the guard, Justin, who takes them to the rats' Senate room. As they enter, a charismatic rat, Jenner, is railing to the council about the plan of the rats' leader, Nicodemus, who wants to abandon the rose bush and move to a location called Thorn Valley where they'll found a new colony based on their own labors, rather than stealing supplies from the farmer. Jenner is opposed to the idea and even suggest that they wage war against any humans who attempt to drive them out. Justin and Ages make Mrs Brisby's case to the council, who agree to the request because she is Jonathan Brisby's wife. In a sinister private meeting with his associate, Sullivan, Jenner plots to have Nicodemus killed during the operation and make it look accidental.Justin takes Mrs Brisby to meet with Nicodemus. A very old, kind and wise leader, he tells Mrs Brisby the rats' history: they were all lab animals imprisoned in NIMH, the National Institutes of Mental Health. Injected with experimental compounds, the rats developed intelligent brains and were able to escape their cages, along with several mice. During their escape, all but two of the mice, Jonathan and Mr Ages, were sucked into the ventilation system by strong air gusts. When the party were trapped by a vent grating, Jonathan was small enough to crawl through and open the grate. The rats subsequently owed Jonathan their lives and he continued to work with them while they built their colony. Some months prior to Mrs Brisby's visit to the rose bush, Jonathan had been killed by Fitzgibbons' ornery and fearsome cat, Dragon, whom the rats had been trying to drug. Nicodemus gives Brisby a large red amulet and tells her that it has great supernatural powers when someone shows true courage of the heart. Nicodemus says that the rats will be happy to repay their life debt to Jonathan's family and will move her home.For the operation to succeed, Dragon will have to be drugged. Mrs Brisby, feeling she should participate, volunteers to spike Dragon's feeding dish. The only way into Fitzgibbons' kitchen is through a small hole under a sideboard, a hole too small for any rat. The plan goes well until Mrs Brisby runs back and is trapped by Fitzgibbons' son. Justin leaves her, having to supervise the operation, promising to come back for her. While she's trapped in a bird cage, Brisby overhears Fitzgibbons on the phone with NIMH, who want to come to his farm and capture the rats. Brisby realizes the situation is now more desperate and escapes the bird cage by knocking out its small water cup.At the site of the Brisby home, the rats have constructed an elaborate system of ropes and blocks and tackles to lift the cinderblock. While the block is being swung towards the stone, Jenner cuts the anchoring lines with his sword and the block falls, narrowly missing Nicodemus, however, the heavy gears and rope fall on him, killing him. Jenner declares the operation a failure and suggests they leave when Mrs Brisby arrives. Justin tells her that her family is alive but Nicodemus is dead. She suddenly remembers her urgent news that NIMH will be at the farm tomorrow and tells the rats they must leave tonight. Jenner refuses to believe her and tells the rats that he will take over leadership of the colony. When Mrs Brisby insists she's telling the truth, Jenner strikes her and notices that she's wearing the amulet. Attempting to seize it from her, Justin intervenes and fights with Jenner until he wounds him. Jenner admits that he'd caused the accident that killed Nicodemus, saying that the plan to move the colony would fail. As he moves in to kill Justin, Sullivan kills Jenner with a thrown dagger and succumbs to his own wound, inflicted by Jenner himself when he'd given his own sword to Justin during the fight.Moments later, Mrs Brisby sees that her house has begun to sink into the mud, taking her children with it. A futile attempt to rig a new roping system fails and Brisby herself vainly pulls at the remaining ropes as the house sinks under the surface. Justin rescues her, holding her back. As she looks on in horror, the amulet suddenly bursts from the mud, brightly glowing, and places itself around her neck. Using the power that Nicodemus spoke of, she raises the house from the mud and moves it to the lee side of the stone. Brisby's children are safe and she faints from exhaustion.The next morning, with Timmy on the mend from his pneumonia and the now-abandoned rose bush being inspected by NIMH, Jeremy arrives with mounds of string that he'd been collecting to build a love nest and finds the Brisby home already moved and even camouflaged by the natural vegetation. He asks Brisby for the amulet, however, she'd given it to Justin before they'd left the rose bush. While he laments that he wasn't able to help move the house, a female crow suddenly flies into him. The two become immediately infatuated. While Brisby's daughter wraps her mother's hands which were burned by the amulet, Auntie Shrew arrives for a visit, bringing groans from Martin as Jeremy and his new love fly off."

A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084329/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wacky inventor and his wife invite two other couples for a weekend party at a romantic summer house in the 1900s countryside. Centred around a weekend party at the home of inventor Andrew Hobbs and his wife Adrian, attended by randy doctor Maxwell Jordan, his nurse Dulcy, renowned philosopher Dr.Leopold Sturgis and his fiancée, this is a light comedy concerning their various emotional, intellectual and sexual entanglements, loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night' .—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> It's the turn of the nineteenth into twentieth centuries. Andrew, a Wall Street investment advisor whose true passion is inventing novelty items, and his staid wife Adrian are spending the summer, like they do most summers, at what has long been Andrew's cottage in the woods of New York. They have hit a rough spot in their marriage, not having had sex in six months as Adrian has had a mental block concerning the act. They have invited two couples to stay with them at the cottage one weekend. Maxwell, Andrew's best friend, is a Lothario of a physician, he often sleeping with his female patients. Who he has decided to bring for the weekend is his new and very young nurse, Dulcy. On the surface, Dulcy is an innocent, but one does not need to scratch very deep below the surface to find that she is a sexual aggressive. She knows what she is doing in this department largely due to her knowledge of anatomy. The other couple is Adrian's much older cousin Leopold, a philosophy professor and general man of the world, and his younger fiancée Ariel, who Andrew and Adrian have yet to meet... or so they say. What Andrew is afraid to tell Adrian, especially in light of their sexual issues, is that Ariel is an old girlfriend of his who he once brought to the cottage, something that quickly does come to light. Leopold and Ariel will be getting married at the end of the weekend before they head off on their honeymoon. Each person at the cottage ends up having his/her hidden or not so hidden agenda for the weekend. Maxwell has for the first time in his life fallen in love - at first sight no less - to Ariel, who will at least hear him out on the issue. Maxwell cannot bear to see Ariel marry Leopold, who he considers a pompous ass. Leopold, who was a confirmed bachelor before he met Ariel, wants to sow one last wild oat with Dulcy before he settles down, something to which Dulcy is amenable. Adrian, who wants her marriage to Andrew to work, secretly wants sex advice from who is probably the most knowledgeable in that department, namely Dulcy. And Andrew and Ariel, who never consummated their relationship when they dated, can't help but wonder if they would have ended up together if they had, especially as they still have undeniable feelings for each other. The problem each couple faces is that there are four other people in their confinement who may catch wind of what's going on. But what has been known to be the enchantment of the local woods may sort out all these issues by the end of the weekend.—Huggo A married couple, Andrew and Adrian, invite a group of friends over to their house in the country for a few days.

Is Clouseau alive or is he dead? Each interview has not-yet-seen or famous clips from the previous movies (since Peter Sellers died) as Marie continues to get a honest view or impression of the great French detective.—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> In the opening scene, (a deleted scene from 'The Pink Panther Strikes Again') French Sûreté Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) enters a wig and makeup shop, where he is fitted for a prosthetic nose, wig, and false teeth by owner Professor Auguste Balls (Harvey Korman). Meanwhile, a television news anchor reports on the third theft of the Pink Panther, the world's largest cut diamond owned by the Middle Eastern nation of Lugash. Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) meets with Commissioner Lasorde (Marne Maitland), who informs the detective that the Lugashian President Haleesh personally requested that Clouseau investigate the case.While smoking his pipe in his office, Clouseau sets his newspaper on fire and destroys the room struggling to extinguish the flames.Dreyfus attends a therapy session with a psychiatrist to discuss his renewed obsessive desire to kill Clouseau and end their long-standing rivalry.That night, Clouseau's pursuer watches his apartment building as the bumbling inspector spills his groceries across the lobby floor.At the police station, Dreyfus' assistant, Sergeant Francois Duval, informs his superior that Clouseau intends to travel to London, England, in search of Sir Charles Litton, also known as the ""Phantom,"" whom he once suspected of a previous Pink Panther theft. Although Clouseau seems unaware that Litton has moved to the South of France, the two officers decide not to inform him.On his way to the airport, Clouseau detonates his car engine while attempting to fix the dashboard cigarette lighter. Wrapped under bandages and a splinted leg, he notifies London's New Scotland Yard that he will be arriving in England in ""disguise,"" and boards the airplane. While airborne, Clouseau struggles to use the lavatory and becomes trapped in an inverted position for much of the flight. Once the plane lands, Scotland Yard detectives Alec Drummond and Hugh McLaren struggle to identify Clouseau, but recognize the inspector when he tumbles down the jet way stairs.Meanwhile, Dreyfus dreams of living a life without Clouseau and swimming in a pool full of gelatin. Awakened by a telephone call from Drummond, he learns about a possible Libyan assassination attempt on Clouseau's life, which the target has refused to take seriously, and Drummond urges him to send Clouseau back to Paris.While attempting to answer a telephone call in his hotel room, Clouseau is repeatedly knocked out the window by the bustling charwoman, and pulls the telephone wire out of the walls. Finally, Clouseau receives instructions from Dreyfus to go to Lugash, despite Drummond's warning.Meanwhile, Lugashian Colonel Bufoni informs President Haleesh that various insurance companies have already paid the government $12 million for the Pink Panther's theft, and resolves to protect the president's reputation by stopping Clouseau's arrival. During another therapy session, Dreyfus learns that Clouseau's airplane has gone missing over the ocean.Later, while being interviewed by investigative television reporter Marie Jouvet (Joanna Lumley), he struggles to mask his scathing dislike of Clouseau and glee over his presumed death.Marie also interviews Clouseau's Chinese housekeeper, Cato (Burt Kwouk), who helped train the detective for unexpected criminal attacks (in flashbacks to 'Return of the Pink Panther', The Pink Panther Strikes Again' and 'Revenge of the Pink Panther).She then finds Clouseau's former assistant, Hercule Lajoy (Graham Stark), aboard a river barge, and learns about the inspector's unorthodox crime-solving methods (in more flashbacks to the film 'A Shot in the Dark'). Lajoy encourages her to interview the criminals that Clouseau pursued and incarcerated.After watching Marie's first television report about Clouseau's disappearance, a Mafia boss named Bruno Langois (Robert Loggia) meets with other organized crime leaders and decides to track Marie's whereabouts to ensure that Clouseau is never found.Sir Charles Litton (David Niven), and his wife, Lady Litton (Capucine), the previous owner of the Pink Panther, tell Marie about meeting Clouseau 20 years earlier while skiing in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (in a long flashback from the first 'Pink Panther' film); Clouseau and Lady Litton were married and later divorced before she remarried Charles and the inspector falsely accused him of stealing the jewel. Describing how the Pink Panther was actually taken by a man in a gorilla suit at a costume party, they reveal that Clouseau himself was mistaken for the criminal and subsequently arrested. Despite the detective's mysterious disappearance, the Littons insist that he is still alive.After the meeting, Marie's taxi driver (William Hootkins) is threatened into driving her to a secluded villa to meet Bruno, where she refuses the Mafia leader's request to stop her investigations. Later, Dreyfus declines Marie's demands to incriminate Bruno for her kidnapping, prompting her to accuse the police of sustaining corrupt ties to the Mafia. As a result, she begins developing a television expose on the subject and breaks into Clouseau's apartment while she believes Cato to be away on vacation. Cato springs from a secret hiding place to attack, but realizes who she is and tells her about Clouseau's upbringing on a French vineyard.Marie then speaks with Clouseau's ill and forgetful father (Richard Mulligan), who now lives with his son's former nurse and her energetic dog. Clouseau Senior recalls how his son became a policeman: After the love of his life married another man, Clouseau botched his own suicide and later joined the army in World War II, where his incompetence caused him to fumble the assassination of various important German officials.In Marie's final report on the subject, she refuses to believe that Clouseau has died and suggests that he has gone into hiding. While swooping over a rocky beach somewhere in Europe, a seagull deposits droppings on the inspector's familiar trench coat as he curses, ""swine seagull!"""

However, the tremendous passion of this girl's first romantic love is so strong, it bypasses the terror around her - including her brother's unusual demands - as it pushes her on to her own bizarre destiny. Desire... passion... blood, her lust transforms her into one of the Cat People.—MCA Home Video Irena Gallier (Natassia Kinski) is a young woman whom was raised by adoptive parents and is, for the first
time since childhood, meeting her older brother Paul living in New Orleans. Paul (Malcolm McDowell) meets Irene when she arrives at the airport and drives her home to his apartment. Paul lives by himself with only his housekeeper Female (pronounced Fee-MAL-ee) (Ruby Dee) to look after him. Irena and Paul are descended from a line of 'cat people,' people who turn into panthers after mating and who must then kill in order to take human form again.Irena knows nothing about this side of her ancestry. She is still a virgin, so she has no idea what sex will do to her. On the other hand, Paul has been living with this knowledge for years and has worked out a system whereby he uses hookers as his prey. In fact, on Irena's first night in New Orleans, Paul arranges for a hooker (Lynn Lowry) to meet with him at a cheap hotel. Unfortunately (for Paul) but fortunately (for the hooker), the hooker escapes with her life and Paul is left in his panther form, trapped in a hotel room. Curator Oliver
Yates (John Heard) and his assistants, Alice Perrin (Annette O'Toole) and Joe Creigh (Ed Begley Jr), from the New Orleans Zoo, are called to capture the black panther and put him behind bars.With Paul gone, Irena decides to spend her first full day in New Orleans by seeing the sights. First, a taxi ride through the French Quarter; then a stop at the zoo where she is fascinated by the new panther, so fascinated that she is still there sketching him 1-1/2 hours after the zoo has closed. When Oliver startles Irena, she drops her sketch pad and runs for the trees, winding up on top of one. Oliver coaxes her down. After noticing that Irena feels excessively warm, Oliver takes her inside and puts a cool cloth on her forehead. Thinking her exhaustion might be due to hunger, they decide to get something to eat. During the dinner conversation, Oliver learns that Irena is looking for a job and hires her to work in the zoo's gift shop.Irena's first day on the job is memorable. Alice introduces herself to Irena, and the two get lunch. A strange woman calls Irena 'mi hermana' (my sister). That afternoon, as Irena continues looking at the black panther, it suddenly goes crazy and when Joe tries subduing it, the panther graphically rips Joe's right arm off and he quickly bleeds to death. By the time Oliver gets back with his gun to kill the beast, however, the panther has disappeared. When Irena gets home that evening, Paul returns, but he no longer seems so brotherly. He claims that he was ""in jail"" during his time away. He tries to get Irena to have sex with him, telling her that he's the only one who can touch her and she's the only one who can touch him. Irena knows only that she is attracted to Oliver and wants nothing to do with having sex with her brother, so she runs off.While running in the street, Irena flags down a police car, but they find no one chasing her. However, when the police dog begins going nuts, they do a search of the area. The police dog leads them to Paul's basement
where they find a cage, chains, and parts of several bodies. A check on Paul Gallier shows that he's been in and out of mental institutions since the age of 10, when his parents killed themselves. They were circus
performers, and Paul grew up around big cats. Thinking that Paul might have been the one keeping the escaped panther, they call the Zoo. Oliver and Alice come over. It is the policeman's opinion that Paul meant to kill Irena, so he suggests that she find someplace else to live. Oliver offers her a place to stay with him.Irena is becoming more and more troubled. As if the stuff with Paul wasn't bad enough, one night she finds herself running on all fours after a rabbit. It's also becoming apparent to her that she is falling in love with Oliver, and he with her, but she tells him that she cannot make love to him. Alice is also in love with Oliver, and this is evoking feelings of rivalry in Irena.A week goes by, and the search for the escaped panther has proven fruitless. In the meantime, Paul has murdered another girl. He feels that he can no longer go on like this. He crashes through Irena's bedroom
window one night and, once more, tries to have sex with her. It's the only way they can live, he explains, just as their parents, who were also brother and sister, lived together as husband and wife. Irena refuses and
stabs him with a piece of broken window glass. Paul turns into a panther. When Oliver comes home, Alice in tow, he is attacked by the panther. Alice gets the shotgun and shoots it dead. When Oliver autopsies the panther, he is horrified to see a human hand in its stomach, after which the entire panther spontaneously disintegrates.The next morning, Alice is out jogging. It's getting late, and she stops at the gym for a quick swim and change of clothes. As she is getting undressed, she hears a growl. Afraid, Alice jumps into the pool. Suddenly, the lights go out and the growling gets louder. Alice begins to scream. When the lights are turned back on, Irena is standing there. The receptionist hands Alice her robe, only to find that it is torn into shreds.Alice calls Oliver to warn him of her experience, but Oliver is too charmed by Irena, who has just returned and is taking off her clothes, letting him know that she is ready to make love. Afterwards, she turns into a panther, but she leaves before she can harm Oliver. She is spotted near the bridge. SWAT teams have been called to corner the panther. Oliver and Alice arrive. Despite this presence, the panther gets away.Oliver goes looking for Irena. He finds her in human form because she has killed. Irena begs Oliver to kill her. Oliver refuses, so Irena asks him to free her by making love once more. ""I want to live with my own""
she says. Oliver binds her arms and legs to the bed, strips off all of her clothes, and makes love to her.In the final scene, Oliver stops at the new panther's cage at the zoo. It is obvious that the ""re-captured panther"" is Irena, now trapped forever in her panther form. Oliver reaches through the bars and strokes the docile panther's neck."

The gang steals the silver cannister containing parasite, not realizing what it is, and it breaks out and infects one of the members which the parasite slowly eats the thug from the inside out.Meanwhile, Paul befriends a pretty young lemon grower named Patricia Wells (Demi Moore), who promises to help him destroy the escaped parasite. Ricus, trying to save the life of his friend, comes to Paul for help, only to be confronted by Wolf. Patricia, Paul, and Ricus manage to evade Wolf, but when they return, the parasite has spread to another member and grown into a fleshy worm with a mouthful of deadly teeth. After luring out and killing the parasite in Paul (which is brought out by a surge of an electrical current), the main parasite worm attacks Wolf, who is then blown up by Patricia, Paul, and Ricus at the local gas station, apparently killing it for good."

Forced Vengeance,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083960/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A casino security guard is forced into violence from when the Hong Kong mob threatens his friends. Josh Randall works for the owner of a Hong Kong based casino and is treated like a son. When the owner is approached by someone who's connected and wants to buy his casino, the man refuses the offer. Later the owner and son are killed. Josh then gets the man's daughter and tries to protect her. Later Josh is pursued by the police and anyone who helps is killed. Josh tries to get to the people who did it.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Josh Randall (Chuck Norris) is the head of security for the Lucky Dragon Casino in Hong Kong. As the movie begins, Randall is visiting Los Angeles to collect $115,000 owed by a rich gambler to his employer, David Pascal (Frank Michael Liu). After a few threats and some fighting he collects the debt. He dozes during a jet flight back to Hong Kong and the viewer sees in flashback how he got in a fight in the Casino when he was on leave from the US Army and ended up befriending David's father, Sam (David Opatoshu).Josh goes to the casino upon his arrival in Hong Kong and checks in the money. While he's there, David asks him to help terminate one of the Dragon's dealers who is skimming money. David fires the dealer, telling him he's lucky he doesn't have his hands broken for what he's done. The dealer is humiliated by being forced to walk out of the casino without his pants, a punishment Josh considers excessively harsh.After work, Josh visits Sam, and the two share some reminiscences about the old days. Sam asks Josh what is going on with David and the casino, saying his gut tells him that something is wrong. However, Josh has not been taken into David's confidence and doesn't know what to say. Sam invites Josh back later to visit and watch some soccer with himself and David.After picking up some food, Josh heads home to his houseboat out in Aberdeen Harbour, where he spends a pleasant interlude with his beautiful blonde girlfriend Claire (Mary Louise Weller). A couple hours later he returns to the Dragon, just in time to foil an attempted robbery.That evening, Josh, Sam, and David are relaxing at the Pascal home with some beers and watching a soccer game. David tells Sam that a competitor, Stan Ramondi (Michael Cavanaugh), has an interesting business proposition for a merger the elder Pascal should hear. He suggests that the men go to Ramondi's restaurant and casino after the game. Ramondi is widely known as a mobster and runs a Triad-backed syndicate called Osiris which extorts protection money from Hong Kong businesses, but with some misgivings Sam agrees to go.Upon arrival the Pascals and Randall are escorted into Ramondi's office. Ramondi has much praise for Randall, saying he has heard many good things, and even offers Josh a job. When Randall turns him down Ramondi asks him to wait outside in the casino. Ramondi then gets right down to business, telling Sam Pascal that times are changing and he should bring his business in under the umbrella of Osiris. Sam gets angry at this, saying he doesn't need to procure protection from Osiris and that Ramondi's offer is a joke and bullshit. Sam storms out. Meanwhile, Randall has run afoul of Ramondi's hulking bodyguard, Kam (Seiji Sakaguchi). They nearly come to blows until Ramondi calls off his goons.On the way home, David tells Sam that they are almost broke due to David's gambling losses, and that they have no choice but to take Ramondi's offer. Sam is furious to hear this, telling David that he needs to straighten up or he will be out of the business. As they return to the Pascal household, David asks Josh to return later, fearing that there may be trouble. Soon after Randall leaves, Osiris assassins show up at Sam's home and wipe out everyone in the family except for Joy (Camila Griggs), Sam's wild child daughter.When Randall returns to the Pascal home, he finds David and Sam murdered. Knowing that both he and Joy are in deadly danger, he shows up at the swing condo where she lives, and almost coerces her into accompanying him, much to her annoyance.Randall decides to go to the police and drops Joy off with Claire at his houseboat. Two police inspectors, Keck (Jimmy Shaw) and Chen (Lloyd Kino), intercept Randall on his way to the station and arrest him. Randall is brutalized by Keck as he is taken into custody. The police attempt to pin the murder of the David and Sam Pascal on Josh and Keck has him strip searched. Finally due to lack of evidence the cops are forced to let him go.Randall visits the place of business and warehouse of his old Vietnam buddy Leroy Nicely (Bob Minor), and obtains a .45 automatic and a Gerber combat knife. Leroy tells him that he has a $150,000 price on his head, to which Josh jokingly replies ""Hong Kong or American?"" Leroy volunteers to go with Randall like in the old days when they were part of the A-Teams in Vietnam, but Josh tells him to stay and protect the girls.On the way back to his houseboat Josh sees Keck staking him out and sneaks up on him, returning the beating he had taken earlier. Rounding up Joy and Claire, Josh attempts to run and hide out from the mobsters men throughout Hong Kong, but this turns out to be difficult for a big blonde American with two beautiful women in tow. After a number of Karate battles and shots fired, he drops the girls back off at Leroy's.Realizing that Ramondi must be a figurehead as there is no way he has the authority and influence to be at the top of Osiris, Josh resolves to track down who the real leader is, as that person is the one who ordered the killings. After following some leads Randall finds out that aging and supposedly retired crime lord Simon Koo (Peter Gee) is the actual head of the Osiris syndicate and also that Koo is secretly Ramondi's father.Randall returns to the warehouse to find Ramondi's thugs broke into the warehouse and mortally injured Leroy, kidnapped Joy, and raped and killed Claire. Seriously going on the warpath, Josh dresses up in military uniform to get into Ramondi's restaurant without being recognized. Once inside he waylays one of Ramondi's goons and wrings Ramondi's location out of him, discovering that Joy is being held captive on Ramondi's private yacht.At the shipyard Randall takes on more of Ramondi's men and has his life saved by the timely intervention of Inspector Chen who it turns out is part of an international task force against organized crime in Hong Kong. Chen informs Randall that Inspector Keck was arrested and he confessed that he worked for Ramondi. Randall decides to go onto Ramondi's yacht and rescue Joy and Chen says he can't let Randall go alone. While overcoming Ramondi's bodyguards aboard the yacht Chen is wounded, then Randall gets into a savage and difficult battle with Ramondi himself, who like Randall is very skilled in the martial arts. Finally he wins the fight after Ramondi's neck is accidentally caught in a rope and snapped when he falls.Randall leaves Joy in the care of the Inspector and goes after Koo. Arriving at Koo's compound, Randall fights his way in. Once inside, he confronts Koo, telling him he killed a lot of good people. Koo replies that he has a place for Randall in his organization, asking Josh if Ramondi told him this. Randall tells Koo that he did, right before before he died. Enraged, Koo orders Kam to kill Randall. As the fight begins, Kam goads Randall by telling him that he was the one who raped and killed Claire. Randall is nearly beaten in the terrific battle which follows. Finally, after much furniture is broken and many walls smashed, a wooden window frame with a large dagger of broken glass falls on Kam's neck, cutting his throat. Randall then takes Koo into custody.In the aftermath, Inspector Chen drops off Randall and Joy near the harbor. Chen thanks the two of them for all they did and informs Randall that the key remaining people in the syndicate will be deported, which will finish it. He adds that Simon Koo will be committed to an institution for the insane, the shock of his son's death apparently being too much for him. He also remarks that he wishes Randall would consider taking a job on the police force. As the Inspector leaves, Joy tells Randall that she would like to get the Lucky Dragon up and running again, and asks him if he thinks she can. Smiling, Randall rhetorically says, ""You're a Pascal, aren't you?""In a voice over as the movie ends, Randall states that the city of Hong Kong lives on borrowed time, the lease is running out and the city will be reverting back to the Chinese landlords in 17 years, but as he further muses, Hong Kong's residents are survivors and whatever happens Hong Kong will always be ""the place."""
The Last Unicorn,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084237/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A beautiful unicorn sets out to learn if she truly is the last of her kind in this sparkling animated musical. From a riddle-speaking butterfly (Robert Klein), a unicorn (Mia Farrow) learns that she is supposedly the last of her kind, all of the others having been herded away by the Red Bull. The unicorn sets out to discover the truth behind the butterfly's words. She is eventually joined on her quest by Schmendrick (Alan Arkin), a second-rate magician, and Molly Grue (Tammy Grimes), a middle-aged woman who dreamt all her life of seeing a unicorn. Their journey leads them far from home, all the way to the castle of King Haggard (Sir Christopher Lee).—L. Hamre The Enchanted Tale of The Last Unicorn. Upon hearing that she may be the very last of her kind on Earth, a Unicorn (Mia Farrow) goes in search of others like her. Her quest won't be easy, as it leads her straight to the evil King Haggard (Christopher Lee) and his infamous Red Bull. And the journey is made even more complicated when, to protect her from the envious wrath of Haggard, a spell is cast to turn the Unicorn into the Lady Amalthea, a beautiful, young human woman. But with this new body comes new thoughts and feelings, such as love for Haggard's son, Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges). Will Amalthea get lost inside this new body? Will she meet the fate of the other Unicorns? Or will she be able to defeat Haggard and his Red Bull with the aid of her friends, Schmendrick the bumbling magician (Alan Arkin) and Molly Grue (Tammy Grimes)? FromArthur Rankin Jr.andJules Bass(The Hobbit), comes a magical adventure with an all-star cast, includingMia Farrow,Jeff Bridges,Christopher Lee,Alan Arkin, [link=nm0342245,Angela Lansbury,Rene AuberjonoisandRobert Klein, and unforgettable songs from the rock band,America. Two hunters (Jack Lester,Ken Jennings) ride through the forest searching for game when they come to a quiet part of the forest. One hunter announces that the forest is magical; hence why there is no snow that falls and it always seems like spring, and that there must be a unicorn living there. The other hunter is skeptical and claims that there are no more unicorns left in the world. The other argues that there must be just one left and, while she exists, there will be no game to hunt in this forest. They turn around, watched by a unicorn (Mia Farrow) who wonders if she is indeed the last. She is approached by a butterfly (Robert Klein) who sings to her and quotes poetry; a typical trait of most butterflies. She asks him if, in all his travels, he's ever seen another unicorn. He taunts her, at first, with riddles and nonsensical lyrics before announcing that all the other unicorns were taken away by a Red Bull that covered their tracks long ago. He then flies away, singing. The unicorn, though hesitant, resolves to leave the safety of her forest and search for the others.She travels over hundreds of miles before coming to a series of farmlands. One elderly farmer (Jack Lester) tries to tame her, mistaking her for a white mare; a mistake which infuriates the unicorn. She cannot believe that all the man sees her as is but a horse and she runs off. However, she comes to realize that if man has forgotten what a unicorn looks like, there may very well be unicorns left in the world hiding in plain sight. One night, while she's sleeping, a side-show caravan led by the witch Mommy Fortuna (Angela Lansbury) comes along. Fortuna places a spell on the unicorn to keep her sleeping before putting her in a cage. The next evening, Fortuna's lackey, Ruhk (Theodore Gottlieb), entertains a group of spectators, introducing them one by one to Fortuna's freaks of nature. He finally shows them the unicorn who has a fake horn placed on her head so that they may actually see it. She is approached by Fortuna's magician, Schmendrick (Alan Arkin), who can see her for what she is and asks her to point out the other captives of the side-show. The unicorn reveals most of them to be normal animals with illusions placed on them, all but the harpy, Celaeno (Keenan Wynn), who is real and as immortal as the unicorn.That night, Schmendrick uses his somewhat faulty magic to free the unicorn who then, in turn, frees all the other captives. However, when she frees the harpy, it turns and attacks her. Mommy Fortuna comes outside with Ruhk to investigate the ruckus and they are both killed by the vengeful harpy while the unicorn and Schmendrick escape. Though Fortuna predicted her death by the claws of the harpy, she dies deliriously happy that the harpy will always know that Fortuna was the one to cage her. Schmendrick accompanies the unicorn on her quest to find the other unicorns and tells her that he knows of a Red Bull that is owned by a king named Haggard (Christopher Lee), though his very existence is shrouded in mystery. Before very long, a group of bandits ride down the road and, while the unicorn hides, Schmendrick is taken captive. He's brought back to their camp where he's welcomed by their leader, Captain Cully (Keenan Wynn) and the scullery maid, Molly Grue (Tammy Grimes). Schmendrick surprises them all, and himself, with a bout of successful magic in which he procures images of the legendary Robin Hood and his merry men. Irritated and frightened by Schmendrick's abilities, Captain Cully ties him to a nearby tree. Schmendrick tries to free himself with magic but accidentally brings the tree to life. The tree (Nellie Bellflower) falls in love with him and nearly smothers him until the unicorn arrives and uses her magic to free Schmendrick. They are then joined by Molly Grue who can also see the unicorn for what she is and weeps at the sight of her, cursing her for coming to her as an older woman rather than a young maid. Molly joins the group as they continue on their journey, much to Schmendrick's disapproval.When they finally have Haggard's castle in sight, the group is suddenly attacked by the Red Bull which ignores Schmendrick and Molly and attempts to herd the unicorn towards the castle. Urged by Molly to do something, Schmendrick uses a great deal of magic to transform the unicorn into a human girl. Confused by the unicorn's different form, the Red Bull leaves. Molly criticizes Schmendrick for turning the unicorn into a mortal and the unicorn is equally upset, crying out that she can 'feel this body dying all around me.' Nevertheless, they continue to the dreary castle and are welcomed into Haggard's decrepit hall, introducing themselves as Haggard's new magician and cook accompanied by the Lady Amalthea. Intrigued by Schmendrick's potential to please him, Haggard dismisses his current magician, Mabruk (Paul Frees), who laughs at Haggard's ill judgement, claiming that he's let his doom walk right through the front door. Lady Amalthea catches the eye of both Haggard and his adopted son, Lir, (Jeff Bridges), though she ignores the advances of both and spends her days wandering the castle, slowly losing memory of who she was or what she was looking for.Realizing that they are losing time and Amalthea is becoming more and more human, Schmendrick and Molly do their best to discover where the lair of the Red Bull is while performing daily tasks to keep Haggard entertained. Finally, Molly receives word from the resident cat (Don Messick) that the lair is located at the base of an old clock, but will only grant entry at the right 'time'. Molly scorns the cat for speaking only in riddles, but the cat merely admits that no cat ever gave a straight answer. Meanwhile, Amalthea and Lir fall in love while Haggard suspects her of her true nature. He tells her that he once saw a unicorn and that it gave him such joy that he sought to keep it for himself. So he commissioned the Red Bull to gather up all the unicorns of the world and drive them into the sea below his castle so that he may look upon them every day.Molly tells Schmendrick that she knows where the entrance to the Bull's lair is and they gather Amalthea and head to the old clock in the main hall. Across from the clock, upon a bureau, lies a crowned skeleton who speaks to them but can only giggle and laugh at their frustration. Per instructions from the cat, Molly produces a bottle of water; the best she can do in lieu of the wine she was supposed to get. When Schmendrick feigns turning the water into wine, the skeleton's interest peaks and he agrees to tell them the secret of entering the lair if they give him the 'wine', now an empty bottle. The skeleton tells them that all they have to do is walk through the clock before gulping down the invisible liquid. However, when he catches sight of Amalthea, he recognizes her as a unicorn and cries out to Haggar. Haggar runs down to the hall and swings his sword at Schmendrick just as Molly and Amalthea enter the realm between the clock and the lair. Schmendrick soon follows just as Haggar destroys the clock portal, trapping them inside. Lir appears, stating that he saw where Amalthea went and he followed.All together, they walk down the lair in search of the exit. Schmendrick explains their plight to Lir who reveals that he doesn't care who or what Amalthea is; he loves whom he loves. Amalthea is inspired by his words and claims that she wants to remain human and die with him, but Lir objects. He tells her that, as a hero, he knows when things should happen, and what should happen is that Amalthea continue her quest and save the unicorns, even if it means that she must become one again and therefore be unable to return Lir's love. The Red Bull suddenly appears and recognizes Amalthea for what she really is. Schmendrick manages to transform her back into a unicorn and she leads the Bull out of its lair onto the beach. With Schmendrick unable to do anything, Lir steps forward but is trampled by the Bull. Enraged, the unicorn turns to face the Bull and intimidates it into the sea where a large wave appears, unicorns emerging from the foam. They envelope the Bull in sea water before storming the beach. They all run upwards towards the castle, releasing it from its rocky base. Before he tumbles to his death in the sea, Haggar shouts out to the unicorn, ""I knew you were the last!""The unicorn returns to Molly and Schmendrick and revives Lir before saying her farewells and departing. The remaining trio returns to the countryside where Lir says his goodbyes before leaving to find his own way. Schmendrick asks Molly to go with him and she agrees. Later the next evening, as they sleep at their camp, the unicorn returns to Schmendrick and expresses her thanks, even if she is the first unicorn ever to feel the sting of mortality and the pain of regret. Schmendrick apologizes but the unicorn tells him that she also learned love, and there are unicorns in the world again thanks to him. For that, she is grateful even if she must feel regret for leaving. She returns home to her forest as Molly and Schmendrick look on after her; at the last unicorn."

The State of Things,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084725/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The crew is running out of money to finish their film. On location in Portugal, a film crew runs out of film while making their own version of Roger Corman'sDay the World Ended (1955). The producer is nowhere to be found and director Friedrich Munro attempts to find him in hopes of being able to finish the film.—Karl Engel <cassiel@ix.netcom.com> A film crew is stranded in a melancholy seaside hotel somewhere outside of Lisbon when the production runs out of money mid-shoot. The director, Friedrich, is a gentle philosophical leader of intellect and heart who enjoys a paternal relationship with everyone in the cast and crew. He is a rock of calm in the midst of this crisis, keeping his charges fed and sheltered not only physically, but emotionally. He accomplishes this through maintaining the company's focus on their art and humanity during the boring days they spend waiting for an infusion of cash to resume work.His steadfast ally in this is the grizzled old cameraman Joe, whose vast experience in the business steadies him as a father can a son. As days stretch out with no word from their producer back in the USA, the people occupy themselves in the minutiae of forestalling the crushing boredom. They are becoming a family of sorts, forced to empathize and interact with each other more intimately than film crews normally do. It is the silver lining in this cloud of doubt enveloping them.But as days become weeks, foreboding begins to overtake them. Joe must return home to bury his terminally-ill wife, reluctantly leaving Friedrich to manage the worsening situation alone. Dennis, the high-strung line producer/writer, begins to snap, despairing in what he calls the ""suicide"" of making films. When Friedrich attempts to assuage Dennis' panic, pleading, ""We're in the same boat"", he replies, ""No, YOU'RE in the boat --- I'm on the ship."" Dennis, like many paranoids, is privy to knowledge others miss. He knows many important facts that he's withholding from Friedrich: like the elaborate data base he's assembled which tabulates and illustrates every aspect of their project from storyboards and budget to biographies of all players ... and most important, the fact that their producer has deserted them and there will be no more money. Friedrich can sense the unspoken betrayal though he cannot believe it. He realizes with alarm that drastic measures are necessary.He desperately flies to Hollywood to talk to his producer and old friend Gordon if only to obtain a reason for his abandonment. Now the interminably sluggish pace of Portugal is accelerated to the frenetic pace of L.A. He soon discovers after a convoluted search that Gordon isn't just hiding from him, but everybody. And there is something very spooky going on: he's being shadowed as he tries to find Gordon. He eventually locates Gordon hunkered down in a borrowed mobile home parked beside LA's last drive-in burger joint on a seedy part of the Sunset Strip. They greet each other warmly and immediately renew their familiar camaraderie.
In the RV, Gordon finally reveals to his friend what has happened. He loved the dailies he saw coming from Portugal. He proudly showed the rushes to the investors, who didn't understand what was wrong with the picture, wanting to know what had happened to the color. When Gordon explained to them that it was shot in black-and-white, they were very disappointed. Unfortunately, these investors' displeasure is keener than normal: they're the Mob. They put out a contract on Gordon. As their night of sad/comic ruminations on the nature of art, stories, Hollywood and reality turns to dawn, the friends step outside the RV for a last hug as Gordon prepares to go back underground and Friedrich back to Portugal to somehow reconcile his crew to the state of things. Then the hit goes down, efficiently, anonymously and finally."

George Bynum, a patient of Manhattan psychiatrist Dr. Sam Rice, is brutally murdered. Soon afterward, Dr. Rice is visited by Bynum's co-worker and mistress Brooke Reynolds and by the investigating officer Detective Vitucci. As Dr. Rice reviews the case notes on his sessions with Bynum, he starts his own investigation. At the same time, he finds himself falling for enigmatic blonde Brooke, despite her increasingly suspicious behavior. The closer Rice comes to the truth, the more he puts his own life in danger...—L. Hamre Just divorced Sam Rice is a sympathetic New York based psychiatrist, following in the footsteps of his psychiatrist mother, Grace Rice. One of Sam's patients, George Bynum, who works in antiquities at Crispins Auction House, is found stabbed to death. Sam is questioned by homicide detective Joseph Vitucci, who believes Sam may have pertinent information among his therapy transcripts with Bynum - information which Sam does not divulge to Vitucci - and may also be eventually targeted by the murderer if he believes the same. Sam is also visited by Brooke Reynolds, Bynum's assistant at Crispins who reveals herself as Bynum's mistress. She wants Sam to return Bynum's watch to his wife, who she believes does not know about her. There seems to be an emerging mutual attraction between Sam and Brooke. In analyzing his transcripts along with Grace, Sam tries to piece together who may have killed Bynum. Along with Brooke's increasingly suspicious behavior, Sam suspects Brooke may not only be the person Bynum mentioned in a session as having previously killed someone, but may be Bynum's murderer and thus after him now. Sam has to reconcile these two sides of his thoughts toward Brooke, which, if she is indeed the murderer, could mean his life.—Huggo Dr. Sam Rice is a Manhattan psychiatrist, recently divorced, who loses a patient when George Bynum is stabbed to death. In flashbacks, Bynum is shown as a middle-aged married man who worked at Christie's, the famous auction house. He was having an affair with another employee, beautiful but elusive Brooke Reynolds. Sam learns quite a bit about Brooke during his sessions with Bynum. She is from a wealthy family but her parents are dead. Bynum hired her on an impulse, even though he had promised the job to someone else.While Sam is reading through his notes of Bynum's sessions, Brooke comes to his office. She introduces herself and asks him to return Bynum's watch to his wife. It is doubtful whether Mrs. Bynum knew of her husband's affair and Brooke doesn't want to upset her. Sam agrees to take care of it. He asks Brooke if she would like to make an appointment for grief counseling. She starts to reply and the buzzer sounds. A Lt. Vitucci from the police department is outside. Brooke is startled and knocks over a figurine on Sam's desk. It breaks and she is very upset. Sam tells her to forget it and shows her to his private exit, where she can leave without being seen by the detective.Vitucci asks Sam many questions about Bynum that he cannot answer due to patient confidentiality. He does confirm that he saw Bynum once a week. Vitucci reveals that the murder was most likely committed by a woman. Bynum was in a bar arguing with a woman. He left and she followed him, after which he was found stabbed inside his car. Sam at once thinks of Brooke but feels protective of her. Vitucci cautions him to be careful for a while, adding that if he thought Sam knew who might have killed Bynum, the killer might get the same idea.Sam goes home but is met by his mother Grace, a retired psychiatrist. She reminds him that they are due to attend a family birthday party that night but he begs off.While doing laundry in the basement of his building, Sam continues to read over his notes.

Suddenly remembering Vitucci's warning, he collects his laundry and heads for the elevator. He is startled when the door opens to reveal Brooke. She explains that the doorman directed her to the basement. The small box she is carrying is a figurine to replace the one she broke earlier. Sam is pleased and expresses sympathy for what she must be going through. Brooke reluctantly reveals that she didn't love Bynum.The next day, Vitucci summons Sam to Bynum's office at Christie's. When he arrives, he is met and escorted upstairs by Gail Phillips, one of the employees. This time Vitucci is not as polite. He says that Bynum was having an affair with at least one of his colleagues but no one knew who. Bynum's secretary reveals that he had an appointment with his psychiatrist five days a week. Sam says that is impossible. Obviously Bynum was using him as a cover. As he leaves, he runs into Brooke but she pretends not to know him.That night a very agitated Brooke comes to Sam's apartment. She wants to know what he told the police about her, as Vitucci questioned her for hours. Sam says he told them nothing but adds that it is foolish to think that they won't find out about her. She admits to feeling guilty because she was trying to break off the affair and now that Bynum is dead, she is relieved. Sam tells her that is a very normal feeling. They kiss but the arrival of his mother interrupts them.Sam is trying to interpret a dream Bynum told him about. In the dream, Bynum was at a house in the country. He went inside and saw a little girl with a teddy bear. The child plucks the eye from the bear, causing it to bleed. Bynum is holding a green box which he puts in his pocket. The child chases him throughout the house and she means to kill him. Since Grace is also a psychiatrist, Sam turns to her for help.

Sam blows it off and says it is a coincidence. He still does not mention Brooke. Vitucci is fed up with him, sensing that Sam knows more than he is telling.Finally reaching Brooke's apartment, Sam is startled to find her naked under a sheet. An Oriental man is there to give her a massage. She invites him to an auction that night at Christie's, adding that she will be taking bids by telephone.Vitucci sees Sam at the auction. He has news that they are closing in on the killer. The bartender who was on duty the night of the murder will be joining Vitucci, to see if he can identify the woman who was with Bynum. Sam sees Brooke but does not have time to warn her. As she hurries away she drops her keys. Instead of returning them to her, Sam slips away and goes upstairs to her office. In her desk, he finds a news article that has been ripped to shreds. He pieces them together and learns that years earlier, Brooke's father fell to his death from a bell tower. Brooke was with him and they were seen arguing, but she was not charged.Sam is certain now that Brooke is the killer. As he locks her office, she comes toward him, asking for her keys.

But she doesn't read the note until the auction is over. In the crush of people, she leaves before Sam can get to her. He tries to call her several times from a phone booth but there is no answer.Seeing her fellow employee Gail Phillips, Sam asks if she knows where Brooke might have gone. Gail hesitates but reluctantly gives him the address of Brooke's parents, who owned a house outside of town. He sets off there by car.When Gail reaches her apartment, she is surprised to see that Vitucci is waiting. He asks to speak to her about Ms. Reynolds. They go inside, where Vitucci sees dozens of framed pictures of Gail and George Bynum together.Sam finds Brooke's house and realizes it is the same one in Bynum's dream. As he goes inside he brushes against a ship's bell, causing it to ring. Brooke is waiting for him and says she did not kill her father. It was true that they were arguing but he fell because he leaned over too far and lost his balance. Brooke has no idea who put the news article in her desk.Sam describes the dream and she admits that Bynum was in the house several times. When he mentions the green box, Brooke says it is not a green box but greenback. Gail Phillips always cashed her paychecks and carried the money with her, which caused Bynum to call her greenback.They realize at once that Gail is the murderer. She and Bynum were having an affair but he broke it off when he met Brooke. He gave her the job he had promised to Gail. It was Gail who put the news article in Brooke's desk trying to implicate her. Sam tries to call Vitucci but he doesn't answer his pager. The scene switches to Gail's apartment. There is blood on the wall and Vitucci is slumped on the floor, stabbed to death.Realizing that Gail must be on her way to the house, Sam and Brooke leave. He gets into the car but she goes back for her cigarettes. Gail is hiding in the back seat and stabs Sam. She then goes after Brooke. When Brooke hears the ship's bell, she senses danger. She runs through the house trying to hide but Gail catches up. She drags Brooke to a balcony overlooking the sea and a pile of rocks. Holding the knife to Brooke's throat, she orders her to jump. Brooke fights back and is joined by Sam, injured but very much alive. Together they wrestle with Gail until she loses her footing and falls. After staring at her body below, Sam and Brooke fall into each other's arms."

Cannery Row,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083717/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Monterey, California in the 1940's. Cannery Row - the section of town where the now closed fish canneries are located - is inhabited primarily by the down and out, although many would not move away even if they could. Probably the most upstanding citizen in the area is Doc, a marine biologist who earns a living primarily by collecting and selling marine specimens for research. He is a lost soul who is looking for his place in life. He is running away from his past, one where he is trying to make amends for what he considers a past wrong. But his current life isn't totally satisfying either. He believes that his recent collection of eight baby octopi will help him define that future in conducting research on their behavior. However, he is finding that research is not as easy as he had hoped, and that he is still feeling restless. Into the area comes drifter Suzy DeSoto. She too is a lost soul. With few job skills, she gets a job as what she calls a floozy in the local whorehouse, despite her openly headstrong demeanor not making her well suited to the work. Doc and Suzy are immediately attracted to each other, but theirs is a clash of personalities, despite each truly liking the other. The other residents of Cannery Row do their part for a Doc/Suzy coupling, not always with successful results. Doc and Suzy will first have to find their own lot in life before they can commit to someone else, be it the other or anyone else.—Huggo A depressed section of Monterey, California, known as Cannery Row from its string of now-empty canning plants is the backdrop for an offbeat romantic comedy about a pair of mismatched lovers. Doc is a lonely marine biologist (and former baseball star) who supplies specimens for science labs and classrooms. Suzy is a scrappy drifter who can't even succeed as a prostitute because of her abrasive manner. When the two get together, it's fireworks, though not the romantic kind. Not to worry, everything is in the hands of Cannery Row's resident guardian angels, Mack and the boys, a band of drunken derelicts whose hearts are in the right place, even though their brains are not.—P.

Frances,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083967/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofFrances Farmer's meteoric rise to fame in Hollywood and the tragic turn her life took when she was blacklisted. Frances Farmer, a precocious Seattle teenager, takes unpopular social and political positions, to the mixed reactions of her parents. Frances becomes an actress and has some strong success in New York City, but her refusal to bend her convictions and her outspoken (but sometimes naive) political expressiveness cause her difficulties, especially after she accepts a Hollywood contract. Torn between new-found success and intense feelings that she does not deserve the riches and fame she gains from the phoniness of Hollywood, Frances butts heads with studio executives and with her own mother, who revels in Frances's fame but provides Frances no emotional support. When drunken fights and arrests derail her career, Frances is sent to a psychiatric hospital with the acquiescence of her mother. What follows is a nightmare of poor treatment and psychological trauma, augmented by the increasing determination of Frances's mother to control her daughter's life.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> A semi-fictional account of the adult life ofFrances Farmeris presented, that account focusing on the rise and fall of her acting career in the 1930s and early 1940s. Growing up in Seattle the only offspring of milquetoast lawyer and his wife Ernest and Lillian Farmer, Frances became, much like her mother, outspoken and strong willed, often speaking out against strongly held societal beliefs of the day (i.e. the Christian right) concerning religion and politics, and publicly calling out hypocrisy. Her want to escape provincial Seattle life and to become an actress were equally strong, which led to a meteoric rise to a studio contract and featured roles in Hollywood movies. She quickly came to the realization that Hollywood and she were a mismatch in the studio's control of her life and her career, including of her personal life, and they largely treating her as just another pretty Hollywood starlet rather than a thinking person with strong views. As much as she tried to escape Hollywood to more aligned acting opportunities such asHarold ClurmanandClifford Odets' theater group in New York City, she was sucked back in time and time again in the control wielded in part by stereotypical stage mother Lillian, her wants for Frances, and thus herself, despite the studio striking out against Frances in her outspokenness against them, they considering themselves the engine that made her a name. The stronger Frances rebelled, the stronger the other sides fought back which led to her multiple institutionalizations regardless if she truly had clinical mental health issues. Her many romantic relationships over this time are also shown, the one constant through it all being her friendship and romance with leftist writer, Harry York, she his true love.—Huggo"
Fanny and Alexander,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083922/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two young Swedish children in the 1900s experience the many comedies and tragedies of their lively and affectionate theatrical family, the Ekdahls. It's the early twentieth century Sweden. Adolescent siblings Alexander and Fanny Ekdahl lead a relatively joyous and exuberant life with their well-off extended paternal family, led by the family matriarch, their grandmother, Helena Ekdahl. The openness of the family culture is exemplified by Helena's now deceased husband ending up becoming best friends with one of her lovers, a Jewish puppet maker named Isak Jacobi, and their Uncle Gustav Adolf's open liaison with one of the family maids, Maj, who everyone in the family adores, even Gustav Adolf's wife, Alma. Between the siblings, Alexander in particular has inherited the family's love of storytelling, his parents and his grandmother who are actors and who manage their own theater. Things change for Alexander and Fanny when their father, Oscar, dies shortly after Christmas 1907. Although she truly does believe she loves him, the children's mother, Emilie, decides to marry Bishop Edvard Vergérus, who she first met as the officiate at Oscar's funeral. She also wants a father figure for the children. Going into the marriage, Emilie has inclinations that it will be a much different life than she had with the Ekdahls, but is not prepared for the harsh, austere and strict life Edvard rules with an iron fist. Emilie, Alexander and Fanny end up being prisoners in the bishop's stark and humorless house. As Alexander butts head with his stepfather and tries to learn how to keep to his own principles while obeying Edvard, Emilie tries to figure out a way to regain her and her children's own destiny, as Edvard will not consent to divorce, and her ""desertion"" in the eyes of the law means that Alexander and Fanny would become his wards.—Huggo Alexander Ekdahl and his younger sister Fanny live a wonderful life. Their parents own a local theater and the extended Ekdahl family are close, spending Christmas together. Just a few weeks after the Christmas celebrations however, their beloved father dies. The children and their mother feel the loss greatly and Alexander occasionally sees his father's spirit in the house. After a period of time, their mother informs them that she is to be married to Bishop Edvard Vergerus, someone Alexander had already encountered over a lie he once told at school. The Bishop's house is a dreary place and the Bishop proves to be a strict disciplinarian who insists on all house rules being followed. After being caught in another lie, Alexander is severely beaten and his mother realizes she must find a way to send the children away.—garykmcd As children in the loving Ekdahl family, Fanny and Alexander enjoy a happy life with their parents, who run a theater company. After their father dies unexpectedly, however, the siblings end up in a joyless home when their mother, Emilie, marries a stern bishop (Jan Malmsjö). The bleak situation gradually grows worse as the bishop becomes more controlling, but dedicated relatives make a valiant attempt to aid Emilie, Fanny and Alexander.—Jwelch5742 The title characters are children in the exuberant and colorful Ekdahl household in a Swedish town early in the twentieth century. Their parents, Oscar and Emilie, are the director and the leading lady of the local theatre company. Oscar's mother and brother are its chief patrons. After Oscar's early death, his widow marries the bishop and moves with her children to his austere and forbidding chancery. The children are immediately miserable. The film dramatizes and resolves those conflicts. A sub-plot features Isak, a local Jewish merchant who is the grandmother's lover and whose odd household becomes the children's refuge.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> This is essentially a four act play. In the first act we meet the Ekdahl family -- large, joyous, prosperous. Then Oscar (Allan Edwall), father of Alexander (Bertil Guve) who might be 11 and Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) who might be 7, dies.In act two, Oscar appears to his children. Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction. Then he locks up the boy.In act three, Isak (Erland Josephson), a family friend, arrives at the house, ostensibly to buy a chest, but actually to smuggle the children out of the house (in the chest!). During this escape, the ghosts of his former family appear to the Bishop. The children are kept for the moment in Isak's house, where Alexander meets Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad) whose paranormal abilities help Alexander start a fire in the Bishop's house, a fire that is fatal to the hated step-father.In the final act, mother (Ewa Fröling) and children are back in the warm comfort of their extended family's house. Gustav (Jarl Kulle), the late Oscar's brother, gives a toast in which he summarizes the play. Without mentioning ghosts explicitly, he says there are things we know and should enjoy, such as food and dance, and many more aspects of life of which we are ignorant."

As this movie opens on an Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression, two simultaneous visitors literally hit the Wagoneer home: a ruinous dust storm and a convertible crazily driven by Red Stovall (Clint Eastwood), Emmy's (Verna Bloom's) brother.

When Christie is wakened by a disembodied voice whispering her name, she runs screaming into the house, where she sees a masked face watching her through a window.

The King of Comedy,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085794/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rupert Pupkin is a passionate yet unsuccessful comic who craves nothing more than to be in the spotlight and to achieve this, he stalks and kidnaps his idol to take the spotlight for himself. Rupert Pupkin is obsessed with becoming a comedy great. However, when he confronts his idol, talk show host Jerry Langford, with a plea to perform on the Jerry's show, he is only given the run-around. He does not give up, however, but persists in stalking Jerry until he gets what he wants. Eventually he must team up with his psychotic Langford-obsessed friend Masha to kidnap the talk show host in hopes of finally getting to perform his stand-up routine.—Andrew Hyatt <dres@uiuc.edu> Rupert Pupkin and a young woman named Masha are arguably national late night talk show host Jerry Langford's most rabid fans, the two who know each other from hanging outside the show's New York studio waiting for Jerry to emerge following tapings. While Masha just wants to be with Jerry, thirty-four year old Rupert is an aspiring comic who not only wants to *be* Jerry, but also wants to appear on his show to launch his stand-up career, despite he never having even performed stand-up for a real audience of any sort. Rupert's fandom includes having a mock set in the basement of his mother's house where he lives, that set complete with cardboard cutouts of Jerry and his celebrity ""guests"" such asLiza Minnelli. Rupert manages to get a few minutes alone with Jerry, during which time Jerry gives him some standard platitudes in trying to get rid of him, which delusional Rupert construes to mean that they have now become best friends and that Jerry will indeed have him on the show. Rupert uses this meeting with Jerry as a launching pad to impress Rita, a bartender who he has known and loved since they were in high school together. Rupert goes about trying to meet with Jerry again to arrange that appearance on the show. He will have to decide how far he should go, as the standard telephone calls to the studio and waiting in the reception area don't get him in to see Jerry.—Huggo Rupert Pupkin (De Niro) desperately wants to become a comedian and approaches popular talk show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) for a chance to perform on his show. After being given the run-around, Rupert teams up with his psychotic Langford-obsessed friend Masha (Bernhard) to kidnap Jerry in hopes of finally getting to perform his stand-up routine. Set in New York City, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a simplistic, driven, and uncool wanna-be comic wanting to break into show business as he is seen stalking his idol Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), a quiet, tired Johnny Carson-like cardboard cut-out of himself.From the moment we see Rupert, he's shoving himself through a large crowd of autograph seeking fans outside a TV studio, separating himself from the group to show that he's after something different. But all this breaks down the moment Jerry Langford exits the studio. The crowd turns crazed and climbs over each other to get close to Jerry. Rupert sees the possibility of a break and goes for it. Rupert pushes back the mob and tries to help Jerry get inside his waiting limousine. But waiting inside for him is the obsessed stalker Masha (Sandra Bernhard), who's hidden in Jerry's car. Rupert slams the door on her face.We're stopped with a flash-bulb freeze frame as the opening credits run. From inside the world of Jerry's car, two hands press hard against the window looking out toward the crazed fans in a mob outside trying to fight their way in. Between the hands peering intensely inside is the illuminated face of our most confident and committed protagonist. Immediately we're faced with opposite sides of a looking glass.Masha is pulled out and Jerry is pushed in. Rupert takes advantage of his situation and jumps into the car with Jerry, again separating himself from the manic autograph hounds just outside the door. As he enters the car, he leaves behind the identity of just being a fan. He and Jerry now have a connection. He now has been given the green light, the blessing of being in the right place at the right time to get what he wants. By coming in contact with his dream nothing stands in his way of reaching out and taking it.Their conversation in the car lets us know Rupert is a comedian who deeply admires Jerry. Jerry is tired from doing his show, but he politely hears Rupert out. The rest of the film soars high into Rupert's imagination based on this simple exchange.Rupert is deceivingly simplistic, but with serious mental health issues. His will to succeed is never sidetracked or affected by outside realities. Rupert only wants one thing: to be a TV talk show host. Nothing will stand in his way. Without a moment's hesitation we find him in ruthlessly embarrassing situations, worthless confrontations, simply for his insistence on turning aspiration into execution. As we follow him and fellow stalker Masha to the bitter end, we see there's no stopping Rupert in getting what he wants. He'll eventually succeed, but to a questionable cost. All he wants is Jerry to recognize his talent and put him on the show. He wants to be friends with Jerry. He wants to be better than Jerry. He wants to bury Jerry. Rupert's problem is that never stops to consider fantasy from reality.The two realities that exist in this film are Rupert's committed fantasy and our outside, unattached, onlooker perception. We see Rupert resting his finger on the receiver of the pay phone waiting for the ultimate call from Jerry. The basement scene with him on set sitting between cardboard cut-outs of Liza Minnelli and Jerry facing Rupert as he mocks up conversation between them.All the conversations Rupert and Jerry have: the office calls where Jerry begs Rupert to host the show, the restaurant meetings where Jerry opens up to Rupert, even to the point where Rupert is being asked for autographs instead of Jerry, or the other patrons in the restaurant are peering across the room at them and can't believe the celebrity sighting they've encountered.Being on TV with Jerry and the high school principal who marries him to his bartender crush then admits, on the air, that Rupert was right all these years and those who doubted him were wrong.The two most effective examples of these two parallel realities are the pull back shot of the laughing audience wallpaper to which he's performing to. Digging further into the dream is the looping laugh track that plays behind his center staged creation.One weekend, Rupert invites a date, Rita, to accompany him when he shows up uninvited at Langford's country home. When Langford returns home to find Rupert and Rita settling in, he angrily tells Rupert to leave. While Jerry yells at him, Rupert continues trying to stay in his good graces, until an embarrassed Rita gets Rupert to finally leave.When the straight approach does not work, Rupert hatches a kidnapping plot with the help of Masha; they both grab Jerry off the street while he is walking from his offices to lunch and hold him hostage at Masha's late parents Manhattan townhouse. As ransom, Rupert phones the TV station and demands that he be given the opening spot on that evening's episode of Langford's show (guest hosted by Tony Randall), and that the show be broadcast in normal fashion. The network bosses, lawyers, and the FBI agree to his demands, with the understanding that Langford will be released once the show airs. Between the taping of the show and the broadcast, Masha has her ""dream date"" with Langford, who is duct-taped to a chair. Langford convinces her to untie him and he manages to slap her and escape.In a five minute monologue sequence, Rupert's stand-up routine is well received by the audience. In his act, he describes his troubled upbringing while simultaneously laughing at his circumstances. Rupert closes by confessing to the studio audience that he kidnapped Langford in order to break into show business. The audience laughs, believing it to be part of his act. Rupert responds by saying, ""Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll all think I'm crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night, than a schmuck for a lifetime."" He then shows up at the bar where Rita is bar-tending to show off to himself on the TV before he is taken away by the FBI agents.Meanwhile, Jerry is free and wondering around alone downtown. Outside a department store, he angrily sees Rupert's full stand-up routine on a series of television display sets in the display window.The movie closes with a news report of Rupert's release from prison after serving two years and nine months of his six-year prison sentence for kidnapping... set to a montage of storefronts stocking his ""long-awaited"" autobiography, 'King for a Night', stating that Rupert still considers Jerry Langford his friend and mentor, and that he is currently weighing several ""attractive offers"", including comedy tours and a film adaptation of his memoirs. (Note: it is unclear if the final scenes are real, or just another product in the deranged Rupert's mind about achieving fame and fortune). The final scene shows a stiff Rupert taking the stage for a television special with a live audience and an announcer enthusiastically introducing him, while Rupert himself forces a smile and nervously prepares to address his audience."

There are complications with the birth, and Dr. Beck (Christopher Lawrence) is forced to perform a c-section. When Mrs. Slater wakes up, she asks to see the baby.

We meet Katie Rose (Kate McNeil) as she discusses her post-graduation plans with her mother (Ruth Walsh). Vicki (Eileen Davidson) interrupts and asks Katie to stay for a big going away party at the house. Katie agrees with a little more goading.

As the girls come up with a plot, Katie gets distracted by the attic windows closing. Dr. Beck examines Mrs. Slater's latest X-rays and says that she's nearing a psychotic breakdown due to the traumatic events of twenty years ago. He says that she has to be hospitalized before some ""traumatic event"" moves her to violence. All she has to do is avoid any traumatic eventsCut to Vicki and her boyfriend's Colt M1911. She says it's all part of her prank on Mrs. Slater. Katie tries again to talk them out of it, but the other girls decide to go through with it. Mrs. Slater comes downstairs to find the girls setting up for the party after she specifically told them to get out. Vicki confronts her and tells her to look out by the pool for her cane.Outside, Mrs. Slater finds her cane floating on a tire in the middle of the swimming pool. Vicki pulls the gun on her and tells her to get in the pool. To reinforce her point, Vicki takes a shot at a nearby lamppost. Liz (Janis Ward) steps forward to object, but Vicki accidentally shoots her in the leg. Vicki tells them to stop being such pussies and forces Mrs. Slater back down into the pool. She fires the gun repeatedly at Mrs. Slater. Nothing happens. Mrs. Slater looks up, puzzled. Vicki and Liz burst out in laughter. Liz's ""injury"" was just part of the show. Furious, Mrs. Slater climbs out of the pool and smacks Vicki in the head with her cane. The gun goes off and Mrs. Slater falls back into the water. When they fish her out of the water, Mrs. Slater is unconscious. CPR doesn't work. Katie wants to send for an ambulance, but again she's outvoted.Vicki makes the suggestion that they just sink the body to the bottom of the murky pool and dispose of the body in the morning. They wrap the body in a tarp and weigh it down, but what they don't see is the body popping up to the surface again after they've gone. Later that night, the girls try to put on their best happy faces for the sorority party. Everyone seems to be having a good time, talking about Greek letters and failing courses. Cut to Mrs. Slater's robe and the tarp thrown aside and someone has her cane. A drunken frat boy (Ken Myers) wanders through the forest and sees something he shouldn't see. The cane is rammed right through the throat. The drunk falls to his knees with blood spurting from his neck.All the girls are on edge at the party, though they try to hide it. Then they hear a woman screaming out by the pool. They all run out there, but it's just a couple of frat boys trying to throw a girl into the pool. Fearing that the body will be discovered, the girls convince the frat boys to leave her and check out the wet T-shirt contest. The frat boys throw her in anyway and then go to check out the contest. They pull her out of the water and Stevie (Ellen Dorscher) realizes that the body will be seen if someone turns on the pool lights. Stevie goes down to the cellar to see if she can't do something about the pool lights. Someone grabs her from behind, forces her up against a wall and stabs her to death (all in the shadows).The band calls all the seniors up for a big dance. Meanwhile, these three guys decide they want to go for a dip. One of the gets shoved in and another one turns on the lights. The girls see the lights go on and all run out, panicked that the body has been discovered. But the pool is empty except a fat frat boy. The girls meet in the kitchen to figure out what they're going to do about this. Katie wants to go to the police. The other girls outvote her again and decide to search for Mrs. Slater's body, theorizing that she must have climbed out of the pool, but been unable to reach anyone before collapsing.The girls separate to go look for the body. Morgan (Jodi Draigie) is sent upstairs to pack Mrs. Slater's clothes so it looks like she packed up and left. As she's collecting clothes, something falls out of the crawlspace onto her and she screams. But her screams are not loud enough for those downstairs at the party to hear her. It was Mrs. Slater's body, still wrapped in the tarp that fell on her. The girls check on Morgan and wonder aloud how Mrs. Slater got all the way up there (but somehow don't wonder why she wrapped herself back up in the tarp after she walked up into the crawlspace). Morgan goes to her room as the girls argue again. Katie gets disgusted with all the arguing and goes to check on Morgan. The other girls decide to dispose of the body again. Morgan gets undressed and prepares for bed. Morgan hears something at the window. She walks out on the balcony and finds a jack-in-the-box. She turns the crank until the little clown pops out. While distracted by this, the killer comes from behind her and shoves the pointy end of the cane right through her chest.Cut to, the girls carrying the body outside and putting it in a dumpster, thinking it'll be a convenient way to hide the body while they get rid of it. Katie, on the other hand, is concerned because she can't find Morgan. She heads up into the attic and finds it filled with a child's toys. She finds a card that reads ""To Eric, Love Mother."" She pulls a curtain back and finds a life-size clown costume and mask that looks just like the one in the jack-in-the-box. Peter (Michael Kuhn) sneaks up behind her and startles her. Then he starts playing around with the toys. Katie tells him to go get another drink and leave her alone. Peter stands to leave and hits his head on a birdcage with a dead bird inside. Outside, Diane is waiting in the van for the other girls. She hears some noises and panics. She gets out and finds no one, so she gets back in the van. Someone reaches through the sunroof and stabs her repeatedly with the cane.Meanwhile, Vicki, Liz and Jeanie (Robin Meloy) are pushing the dumpster down the road. A police car drives up and bumps into the dumpster. Vicki sends Jeanie back to the house before the officer sees her. The officer (Ed Heath) gets out and surveys the damage to his cruiser (not answering why he wasn't paying enough attention to the road to avoid a massive dumpster). He asks what they're doing out at one in the morning. They answer that they always take the trash out on Friday nights. He is about to look in the dumpster when he gets a call on his radio to return to the station.Jeanie reaches the house and has a near miss with the killer. In the fracas, Mrs. Slater's medic alert tag falls to the ground. Jeanne reaches the house safely and finds Katie. Jeanie seems to be in shock because all she can say is ""cane."" Katie tells her to wait there and she'll be right back. Jeanie grabs a chef's knife and waits. Someone breaks the windowpane in the door, though, and unlatches the lock. Jeanie runs upstairs into the bathroom and vomits. The killer follows her in and turns on the showers. Jeanie tries to hide on a toilet stall, but the killer opens the stall and stabs her in the throat. Katie is panicked when she can't find Jeanie. She starts to call the police, but when Peter offers to go get her house mother, Katie realizes she can't call the police without spilling everything. She hangs up and asks Peter to leave. Peter takes it the wrong way and storms out. Katie goes for a walk and finds Mrs. Slater's medic alert tag. She calls Dr. Beck and tells him the situation (not mentioning Mrs. Slater in the pool). Dr. Beck tells her to stay at the house and he'll be right over.When Jeanie can't be found, Vicki and Liz take the body to the cemetery themselves. They find an empty plot and dig it down a little deeper, preparing to toss the body in. Dr. Beck arrives at the house and explains the whole story. Mrs. Slater wasn't able to conceive a child so she turned to him. He did some experimental and illegal procedures to help her conceive. Katie asks him who ""Eric"" is. He says that Mrs. Slater has been celebrating her son's birthday as if he were still alive. He presses her about what happened to Mrs. Slater. Katie looks out the window and sees someone floating in pool. She runs down and turns on the pool lights. It's Diane. Dr. Beck calls the police and tells them to get to the sorority house. Katie realizes that Mrs. Slater probably followed Vicki and Liz to the cemetery. Beck shifts gears and tells the police to meet him at the cemetery.Vicki and Liz have sufficiently hollowed out the hole, so Vicki tells Liz to pull the van around. Liz gets in the van, but someone slashes her throat. Vicki gets out of the plot to see what the holdup is. When she opens the van's door, Liz's body falls out. Vicki turns around just in time to see the killer holding the cane. She gets struck with it several times, including one finishing blow right to the eye. Dr. Beck undoes the ropes tying up the body and pulls back the towels to reveal Mrs. Slater. Katie looks down at her a gawk. Dr. Beck realizes his worst fears and explains them to her with two words: ""He's alive.""Beck tells her to get back to the car. They arrive at the empty house and Katie asks where the police are. He tells her they're not coming and injects her with a sedative. He sets Katie down in the middle of the living room and locks all the doors except for the patio doors, which he leaves wide open.He explains to her that he used a drug on Mrs. Slater to help her conceive. Unfortunately, the drug caused deformities in the fetus. As the room starts to spin, he explains that Eric is evidence of what he did and he must eliminate him. He plans to lure Eric there using Katie as bait. Katie starts to hallucinate, haunted by her dead friends and Mrs. Slater. Someone tries to open one of the doors, but it has been barricaded. Beck sees shadows moving and someone steps into the patio doorway. He fires his tranquilizer gun at the shadowy figure thinking it is Eric, but it's Peter.Beck injects him with a sedative too. Katie takes the opportunity to run up the stairs and into Vicki's room. Beck pleads with her to come back and be his bait. She grabs the gun they used for the prank and loads it in case Beck finds her. Instead, Dr. Beck gets run through with the cane. He staggers down the hall before Eric hits him with the cane again, sending him spilling over the balcony to the hardwood floor. Katie comes out of the room and finds Eric (Charles Serio) standing over Beck's body. Katie runs up to the bathroom and finds Jeanie's severed head floating in the toilet. Katie staggers out to the second floor balcony, trying to find a way out. When she can't find one, she climbs the ladder to the attic.Hearing Eric downstairs, she decides to lure him up to the attic and ambush him. She winds up the music box and sets it at the top of the attic stairway. Unfortunately, the drugs are still working on her and she starts to hallucinate again. Eric still hasn't come up the stairs. In fact, he's wearing the clown costume and mask and is standing right beside her. He tries to stab her with the cane, but she sees him coming just in time and ducks out of the way. She shoots at Eric, but when nothing happens, she realizes that they're all blanks. Eric gets distracted by a little toy ball. Katie sees her chance and rips the head off of one of his dolls to reveal a knife underneath. She stabs him repeatedly in the chest until he falls through the doorway down to the next floor.Katie falls to the floor and lets out a sigh of relief. But while her back is turned, from behind the mask, Eric opens his eyes."

Dave's entrepreneurial younger brother, Wendell (John P. Navin Jr.), nicknamed Wimp, offers to supply the money, but only if he is allowed to go in Perlman's place. Dave reluctantly agrees to the proposal, hoping Wendell will not interfere as the older boys tour the city's nightclubs and brothels. The group faces another obstacle when Spider is given an after-school detention for defending himself against an irate football player.

The boys use the opportunity to shoplift their supplies, unnoticed by the distracted storekeepers. As they race from the parking lot, Kathy requests a ride and announces her plans to file for a Mexican divorce.As the group enters Tijuana, Kathy disembarks at a law office, and the others continue into town. They stop at an automotive upholstery shop, where Dave orders tuck and roll vinyl seats for his 1957 Chevrolet. The local Sheriff (Henry Darrow) appears and expresses admiration for the car, then apprises Dave of a damaged brake light.

When she and Woody criticize his behavior, Spider announces that his friend is impotent. Woody leaves in humiliation, followed by Kathy, who offers to keep him company. While Spider broods over his altercation with Woody, Dave wanders onto the street and encounters Wendell, carrying a large bag of fireworks that he plans to sell at a profit. Stimulated by his first sexual encounter, Spider is on a mission to procure an aphrodisiac known as Spanish fly, which supposedly induces nymphomania in women. Despite Wendell's insistence that the substance does not exist, Dave requests it from a pharmacist, who threatens him with a rifle.Meanwhile, Woody and Kathy become acquainted, and she compliments him on his desire for romance instead of having meaningless sex. She wishes her husband could be as sensitive. Their mutual attraction grows, stimulated by tequila, and they make love in a motel room.Elsewhere in town, Dave pays a taxicab driver $12 for six doses of Spanish fly, ignoring Wendell's insistence that the white tablets are common aspirin.

As Woody and Kathy leave the motel, they see Spider in the back seat of the sheriff's car and follow it to the police station.Spider is placed in a holding cell, where a large prisoner (Cornelio Hernandez) challenges him to a fight, then overpowers the boy and knocks him unconscious. Woody and Kathy try to reason with the sheriff, but he demands $3,000 to release Spider.At the salvage yard, Dave is hoisted on a crane while Pablo threatens to remove his genitals with a blowtorch. Unaware that his brother is being subjected to a mere prank, Wendell commandeers Pablo's car and comes to Daves rescue. The Cartman brothers arrive at the upholstery shop, where Spider, Woody, Kathy, and the Sheriff are waiting for them. Woody informs Dave of Spider's arrest, and explains that they were forced to offer the Chevrolet in exchange for their friends release.

Who is the mysterious Joanne and what's the real story behind Mona's son, James Dean Junior ?—David Gibson <djg@ukc.ac.uk> It's September 30, 1975 in McCarthy, Texas. The Disciples ofJames Dean, the local James Dean fan club, was formed by a group of teens in the mid 1950s largely because Dean, among other major movie stars, was filmingGiant (1956)in Marfa, sixty miles away. Long disbanded when the members dispersed, they nonetheless vowed to meet on this date at their old haunt, the Woolworth five-and-dime, to commemorate the twenty year anniversary of Dean's tragic death. The three members who still live in McCarthy, who are arranging the get-together, are the only definite attendees, as they have not kept in touch with anyone else from the group.

Professor Doug McCadden is in charge of opening his university's latest acquisition - a sealed Egyptian sarcophagus. Opening it reveals an ancient mummy and a mold substance which proves to eat the flesh of anyone touching it. Later, sneaky student Pete Sharpe finds five hidden jewels in the bottom of the casket and distributes them to various co-eds on campus, not realizing the mummy, recently revived with an overdose of x-rays, is bound and determined to reclaim them. McCadden, who has carefully analyzed x-rays taken of the mummy, comes to the reluctant conclusion that it is not what it seems.—Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net> We open with a zoom in from outside our galaxy, the planet Saturn, a view of the earthrise over the surface of the moon, and the earth zooming in on Egypt. Credits roll with the pyramids in the background. A modern archeological team is working when an earthquake rattles their site. When the lights come back on we see King Tut's tomb and a section of wall collapsed. Holding a flashlight is Prof. Douglas McCadden (Ben Murphy). His assistant, Abdellah (Behrouz Vossoughi) is at his side; inside the chamber is another tomb, surrounded by skeletonized remains.A Boeing 727 lands at an airport in Southern California. We see a panning shot of the California Institute of the Sciences (the campus of CSU, Northridge). McCadden is supervising the removal of the sarcophagus of Ankh Venharis from a truck. Annoying the professor is the campus photographer, Linda Flores (Shari Belafonte-Harper). After the tomb is set up in the lab/classroom, his student aid, Susie Fuller (Nina Axelrod) assists with removal of the seals. They remove the outer lid revealing a decorative inner lid. They read the cartouche--Ankh Venharis, translated as ""a noble traveler."" Michael Goldstein (Gary Dubin) asks why they would bury a foreign dignitary with King Tut. They start to remove the inner lid when they are interrupted by Peter Sharpe (Kevin Brophy) and his assistant wheeling in an X-Ray machine. They carefully remove the inner lid revealing the mummified remains of a humanoid body covered with wrappings that are covered with a green powdery substance. McCadden tells Michael to get a sample, but in doing so he gets a little on his wrist, despite wearing protective gloves. Susie hands McCadden a jar; he places the scroll of dedication into same and seals the jar. Class is dismissed. Sharpe derisively dismisses Jack Parker (Robert Random), but McCadden overrules him, explaining he is the chief engineer and he wants him present. Sharpe X-Rays the mummy, but after the third shot, Parker notices the setting on the machine and immediately pulls the plug. Sharpe was using ten times the normal dose. Exasperated, McCadden dismisses Sharpe and tells him to deliver the developed X-Rays to his office. Sharpe develops the X-Rays, but while checking them he notices five spherical objects on the film. McCadden and Susie are cleaning the scroll. Sharpe returns to the lab and aligning the X-Rays to the sarcophagus finds a hidden compartment. He opens it and retrieves a leather pouch containing five crystals. He pockets them, examines the rest of the drawer's contents, and satisfied the rest is worthless, closes it back up. He X-Rays the mummy so he can substitute the new film for the old. He packages the films and delivers them to McCadden's office. He stashes the incriminating X-Ray in a transformer room, but can't retrieve it.The high dose of X-Ray radiation reactivates the mummy. McCadden talks to a colleague on the phone about the green substance; he suspects it is a dormant mold. He asks Susie to run the sample over to Dr. Ken Melrose in Pathology. The arms of the mummy move revealing a bright blue light in his chest. The mummy sits up. Susie jostles McCadden awake. He fell asleep at his desk and it is now morning. Examining the X-Rays, McCadden concludes, ""this mummy wasn't prepared in the standard manner."" In the lab, Susie and McCadden discover the hidden compartment and pull it open. Instead of a green powder, they find a green and yellow wet-paint like substance. As Susie reaches out, McCadden tells her not to touch it, but go tell Melrose that the mold has changed.Sharpe stops by Drucker's Jewelers to have the crystals appraised. The Jeweler (Alan Rachins) informs him, ""they are worthless."" Ken Melrose (Austin Stoker) pays a visit to the lab and takes a sample from the hidden drawer. He informs McCadden that it is the same fungus, but no longer dormant. He advises no one go near it. The press has been invited to the lab where the sarcophagus is displayed. As they take their seats, McCadden talks to the University President about cancelling the press conference. Michael is guarding the sarcophagus when he notices a splotch of the active green fungus and touches it. He screams and holds his hand up in pain. His index finger is partially covered with the mold. McCadden orders Susie to take him to the campus Hospital Emergency Room and to call Melrose. Amid the commotion, the campus President, Dr. Wendell J. Rossmore (James Karen) walks in. He is flanked by his assistant, Dr. Bruce Serrano (Sam Chew, Jr.) and campus police Captain Willoughby (Clint Young). In his lab, Melrose begins his examination of the fungus. Rossmore takes over the presentation to the press, but he has McCadden unveil the mummy. When his students remove the inner lid the sarcophagus is empty.In the President's office, Peter Sharpe is questioned about his possible involvement in stealing the mummy. Parker is also present. Rossmore demands the mummy be found and directs the campus police to find it. McCadden suggests the local police be notified, but Rossmore insists the recovery be handled internally and directs Willoughby to search the campus. The mummy has chosen the reactor room to hide and work. A janitor (Hugh Stanger) comes into clean, discovers it and is killed. McCadden and Melrose are in the Pathology lab. Melrose explains that the fungus is like nothing he's ever seen. The phone rings and they leave. Dr. Hayworth (Antoinette Bower) is treating Michael Goldstein, and explains that the fungus breaks down tissues and doubles its size every 65 minutes. They enter Michael's hospital room. He has his right hand in a tray. Dr. Hayworth removes the cloth to reveal the fungus has covered it and half of his forearm. Dr. Hayworth recommends amputation before it goes any further.Sharpe is peeping at Parker's girlfriend, Jennie (Melissa Prophet) through the window. She is putting on her bra when his girlfriend, Sherri (Greta Blackburn) catches him. Jennie and Sherri are roommates and share a house together. As a peace offering he gives Sherri one of the crystals on a gold necklace. Capt. Willoughby, while on rounds, discovers the Electrical Supply Room has been burglarized. The room is a shambles. He uses the telephone to report the break in to Dr. Serrano, President Rossmore's assistant.McCadden walks over to KCIS, the campus radio station, and meets with Linda Flores. She is the evening DJ in addition to her duties as campus photographer. He broadcasts a message to the Fraternity houses demanding the return of the mummy. He warns them of the danger of the fungus on the wrappings. In need of more cash to take his girlfriend out to dinner, Sharpe sells a crystal to Greg Hauser (Gerard Prendergast). Now flush with cash, he and Sherri go to dinner at a very expensive restaurant. While dining, a couple of fraternity brothers see them and accost Sharpe over some unpaid loan. Stanley (Warrington Gillette) and Bill Vogler (John Lavachielli) take his $50, but he works a deal for a couple more crystals. While dining Sherri notices the crystal getting warm and lighting up and pulsating. After he gets off work, Greg Hauser stops by to see his girlfriend, Ellen Winters (Greta Stapf). She is babysitting. He puts his coat over the baby's crib and the crystal necklace he intends to give her as a present falls out. They walk down the hallway to the bedroom to make out. The mummy is on the prowl to recover his stolen crystals. He enters the house. Greg puts the present around her neck. The baby begins to cry and Ellen goes in to check on him. The mummy reaches out, takes the crystal, and she screams and falls back against the wall with a baseball sized burn on her chest. In the hospital, Dr. Hayworth introduces Lt. Plummer (Darwin Jostin) to Drs. Melrose and McCadden. Plummer tries to question Greg Hauser about the circumstances surrounding Ellen's accident and burn. He's in shock and only says one word, ""Mummy."" The mummy places the first of five recovered crystals on the triangular transmitter/receiver. When he does so electrical appliances in the vacinity begin to malfunction.McCadden has translated the scroll he found with mummified remains of Ankh Venharis. It reads, ""because of his unusual appearance, the Egyptians assumed him to be a god...King Tut reached out to touch the weary traveler and was sorely burned with a disease that consumed his flesh."" Melrose returns to his lab to do an experiment on the fungus; he discovers X-Rays activate it. He concludes that an X-Ray to check for broken bones on Ellen will do the same to her. He calls to have the X-Ray cancelled, but his call his too late. The X-Ray causes the fungus to spread to her neck and head and kills her. Stanley runs into Susie on the campus. He's interested in her, but she does not reciprocate. He gives her a bracelet with a crystal.It's now Saturday and a Fraternity party with an ancient Egyptian theme is starting. The mummy is back on the prowl (or glide) for another crystal. Bill Vogler is looking for his would be girlfriend, Sarah (Michelle Avonne). She stands him up and he throws the crystal necklace on the ground in disgust. He has second thoughts, and retrieves it only to have the mummy pull it from him. He gives Bill a back hand that knocks him into a wall with tremendous force killing him instantly. The mummy adds the second crystal to his transmitter, which causes a wider spread electrical interference. Jack Parker, who stopped by to see his girlfriend, Jennie, excuses himself to check on the power outage. He discovers a power drain in the campus reactor building, investigates, but is satisfied there is no danger. As he exits he bumps into Dr. Serrano and Capt. Willoughby. The fraternity party moves outside. While Jack Parker walks back to see Jennie, he discovers the body of Bill Vogler just as the party walks by. Lt. Plummer arrives and questions McCadden, then questions Rossmore. After the police leave, Serrano tells Rossmore he believes McCadden stole his own mummy and is waiting to return it to be a hero.The next morning, McCadden and Susie discover the bracelet crystal has something inside. It looks like an electrical diagram. The same pattern was on a piece of material they found with the scroll in the sarcophagus. They ask Jack Parker to examine the crystal and the diagram and he agrees they do look like a wiring schematic. McCadden sends Susie to the Library to do some research. When she arrives, the floor is empty. The mummy is outside. He's attracted to the crystal Susie is wearing on her wrist. He follows her inside and chases her around various floors. She escapes into an elevator and manages to get outside on the roof. She notices it glowing and pulsating. She tries to remove it, but is unsuccessful. The mummy reaches out for the crystal while she is trying to descend a ladder. He gets the crystal, but she falls off the ledge of the library building and is seriously hurt. Fortunately he did not touch her while retrieving the crystal. When she wakes in the hospital, Lt. Plummer is there to question her. She states that the mummy is alive and responsible for the deaths on campus, but he does not believe her. The mummy now has three of the five crystals he needs. He steals a transformer from the Archaeology Building to complete his project. McCadden and Parker find mummy wrappings where the transformer was, and the X-Ray films that Sharpe hid. They confront Sharpe with the evidence. He initially denies any knowledge, then comes clean and tells his story. He still has one crystal left, but admits the remaining one he gave to Sherri. Parker realizes that his girlfriend, Jennie is Sherri's roommate and she is in danger. McCadden now has the fifth crystal. Sharpe tells Parker his girlfriend left it home in the bathroom. Parker rushes over to the house, as does the mummy. McCadden heads for the Reactor Building. The mummy retrieves his fourth crystal, but does not injure Jennie. McCadden notices the mummy's improvised transmitter and adds his crystal to the mechanism. Just then Rossmore, Serrano, and Capt. Willoughby walk in. The mummy arrives at the Reactor Building with crystal number four. He moves McCadden's crystal to the correct location and adds the fifth. The system fires up and the mummy transforms into an alien with large black eyes, and a small nose and mouth. Serrano orders Willoughby to shoot it, but McCadden steps in front of the alien to protect it and is hit by the bullet for his trouble. He is hit in the arm and collapses at the alien's feet. It is now glowing and reaches out with his hand to touch McCadden's hand. They grasp each other's hand and the two disappear, leaving only the glowing crystal that was in the mummy's chest. Serrano races over to retrieve the glowing crystal. He screams and holds up his charred hand. It is burned like all the others that were touched by the fungus or the mummy. The movie concludes with the phrase, ""To be Continued."""

In those dealings, Danny devises what is largely seen as a publicity stunt in reality to get the one up on the Quiñoneses, but in which he will have to show his true mettle as a great escape artist. In the process, Danny may also provide some justice for his father, the true nature of his death which Danny learns along the way.—Huggo The young and self-confident Danny bluffs at the local police-station that he will escape out of prison within one hour. What follows is a flashback about his childhood with his uncle and aunt, which are 'vaudeville'-artists themselves. We also follow the problems of Danny with the corrupt son of the mayor.—Evert Poppen Danny Masters, teen-aged son of the late Harry Masters, the ""greatest escape artist except for Houdini,"" leaves home to join Uncle Burke and Aunt Sibyl (formerly called Louise) in their magic/mentalist act. Sibyl welcomes him; Burke is unenthusiastic. Danny is himself an accomplished magician and escape artist. He soon finds himself embroiled with Stu Quinones, over-the-edge son of Mayor Leon Quinones. The quest for a missing wallet with ""hot"" bills inside (pocket-picked by Danny) leads to the comeuppance of the crooked mayor and -- separately -- of his vindictive and out-of-control son. Along the way, Danny comes to terms with the death of his father, the circumstances of which he did not previously know.—Robert Reynolds"

In prison she gets pregnant by a jailer and has to fight to keep her child. 17-year-old Terry Jean Moore is trying to survive in small-town Ohio. She has little belief in her own value, so when her cousin shows up to raise a little hell, she goes along for the ride; she knows he's likely to cause them both a lot of trouble, but she lacks the confidence to stop him. He commits an armed robbery and when they're caught, she's the one who catches the heat instead of her punk cousin. Her self-destructive rage increases her time in confinement until she is sentenced to a women's prison in Florida. There she meets a deputy who promises her the moon--with no intention of following through. When he gets her pregnant, she slowly realizes that she now has something real to fight for, and with love and support from a few fellow inmates, she writes to and starts a professional relationship with an attorney who offers to represent her. He helps her change the laws of incarcerated pregnant women in the State of Florida. While Terry Jean Moore was released shortly after the birth of her child, her story inspired many women that there was something worth fighting for and that they too could enjoy the same hard-won redemption.—eagenge@gmail.com Following her parents' divorce and nomadic childhood, 21-year-old Terry Jean Moore (Amy Madigan) moves to New Orleans, Louisiana, and later to Orlando, Florida, with her underage teen cousin, Jesse Chaney (Lewis Smith). While hitchhiking out of Orlando on August 12, 1977, a car stops for them. Jesse points a gun at the driver and instructs Terry to take the wheel, but she claims she cannot drive a manual transmission stick shift vehicle. As they argue, the driver escapes with the keys, and the pair is later arrested outside a convenience store. With Jesse locked in a juvenile probation center, Terry is charged with armed robbery. Despite her clean record and her argument that she never touched the gun, the unforgiving judge sentences her to 15 years in a woman's state prison, with the possibility of parole in seven years.On the first day, when the other inmates burn Terry's books, the guards see her standing over the flames and confine her to a solitary cell. Losing her temper, she uses a cigarette to set fire to her bed linens, an action for which she is sent to the Broward County Correctional Institute and with an additional five more years added to her prison sentence. There, Terry is instantly derided by the other prisoners, earning the nickname ""Prom Queen."" A violent brawl with a nosy cellmate prompts a verbal disciplining from the sympathetic Officer Jack Hansen (Beau Bridges), who playfully insists he will break her neck if she continues to misbehave.Eventually, Terry strikes up a friendship with a lesbian inmate named J. J. (Mackenzie Phillips), but one day, an aggressive woman named Mara (Anna Marie Horsford) threatens her with a blade. Although witnesses defend Terry, prison warden Captain Mark Ellis (Albert Salmi) punishes her with 15 days of solitary confinement.After 200 days of incarceration, Jack and Terry's discreet flirtation develops into a clandestine affair. Meanwhile, Terry is assigned to work in the library alongside June Burns (Rhea Pearlman), who immediately notices Terry's strange relationship with the officer. Following a tryst in the warehouse, Terry wistfully imagines her life with Jack outside of prison, and he promises to find a lawyer to help shorten her sentence.A few months later, with legal proceedings underway, Terry jubilantly informs Jack that she is pregnant. Although she is confident that she will be released before anyone finds out, Jack worriedly returns home to his wife and two children. As the other correction officers begin hearing rumors of Terry's condition, J. J. and June Burns attempt to convince her to have an abortion, but she stubbornly refuses. Suspicious, Capt. Ellis adjusts Jack's patrol so that he remains distanced from Terry.When Mara reveals that Jack is married, a distraught Terry confronts him across a fence, but he insists that telling her the truth would not have made a difference in their situation. Later, she cries in J. J.'s arms and begs June to help her conceal her pregnancy from the prison superintendent, Mrs. Helen Sturgis (Joanna Merlin), who locks her in ""medical confinement"" until she agrees to take a pregnancy test.One day, Capt. Ellis informs Terry that Hansen has quit his job. A month into Terry's isolation, June reads about a law that she believes will help Terry, so the expectant mother writes a letter to a civil lawyer named Jacki Steinberg (Margaret Whitton). Aware that she is now five months pregnant and therefore can no longer be forced into having an abortion, Terry finally admits to her pregnancy. According to a particular statute in the Florida state law, she stipulates that she has the right to keep her child with her in the institution for 18 months.When Jacki takes Terry's case to court, Mrs. Sturgis contests that the prison facility is unsuitable for raising a child, but Terry gives an emotional statement, claiming that the baby has changed her character by giving her a sense of responsibility. Honoring the right of the unborn child to be with its mother, the judge rules in favor of Terry, and she eventually gives birth to a baby girl named Precious.In 1979, Terry and the infant are paroled and Terry serves the remainder of her sentence on probation in Orlando."

An eighteen-year-old high school girl is left at home by her parents and she decides to have a slumber party.

Over her radio alarm clock, a news reporter talks about a mass murder, named Russ Thorn, who escaped from the state insane asylum where he was incarcerated since 1969 for killing five people in nearby Venice, California.

Her parents leave and Trish throws her bag of old dolls in a trash can and begins to walk to school.

The girls coach Jana (Pamela Roylance) yells to get the girls motivated. Valerie impresses the coach by scoring a few baskets, but the others ignore her because she is the new girl at school. In the locker room showers, Valerie continues to be ignored until Trish approaches her and compliments her on her basketball skills. A little later, Trish suggests to her teammates Diane (Gina Mari), Jackie (Andree Honore) and Kim (Debra Deliso) about inviting Valerie to their slumber party. But Diane rejects the idea and begins to bad-mouth Valerie to the rest of the girls. Valerie hears the girls and begins to leave until she is stopped by Trish.

Linda screams, but her screams do not last long. Thorn runs back to the van and drives off.While walking home from school, Diane meets her boyfriend John Minor (Jim Boyce) who surprises her. John asks Diane if she can get around the no-boys-allowed rule at Trish's party. Diane tells John to call her later at Trish's house to ask again.Across town, Coach Jana arrives home only to be surprised when a drill bit crashes through her front door, but it is only her carpenter Pam drilling a peak-hole for her front door. Jana asks the carpenter if she had seen her pet cat, but she hadn't.Meanwhile, Trish arrives home and talks on the phone with Diane until she hears a noise, and is scared by Mr. Contant, who offers to sit and wait with her until the girls arrive.At Coach Jana's house, she hears a noise and opens up a closet door to find her cat, Muffin, jump out and scare her.At nightfall, the driller killer, Russ Thorn, arrives in the telephone repairwoman's van on Trish's street, where he gets out, and lurks in the bushes around Trish's house. Jackie and Kim arrive at Trish's house and show her a bag of marijuana they brought with them and begin to smoke some of it. Mr. Contant walks in and does not seem to mine and he leaves the house, walking next door to the right of Trish's house.Coincidently, the other next door house to the left of Trish's is the Bates home where Valerie is with her younger 14-year-old sister, Courtney (Jennifer Myers), and looking after her while their divorced mother is away for the weekend as well. Valerie checks outside when she hears a noise to see an overturned trash can.Meanwhile, Jeff and Neil arrive and lurk outside the house on the other side to watch the girls change their clothes, smoke more pot, and make a fire in the fireplace. Inside the house, the girls hear a noise and investigate the kitchen, only to find that Diane has arrived. Trish suggests ordering a pizza, and Diane goes outside to get more wood for the fireplace. She meets Mr. Contant, who is chopping snails with a meat cleaver. Diane says goodnight to him and leaves. Just as Mr. Contant is preparing to snag another snail, the driller killer walks up to him from behind and drills him through the neck.A little later, Russ Thorn continues lurking outside the house and just when he is about climb in through a window, Trish appears and closes the window, unaware that he is there. When she looks again, the sees a melted doll (the same one she threw in the garbage earlier), stuck up to the window with the meat cleaver. Trish and Diane go to the garage to check if there is someone there and see that it is not locked. Diane calls John on the phone, while the stoned and giggly girls listen in on the line. Diane hears them and tells John to come over soon. Just then, the lights in the house go out. The girls go to the garage to check the fuse box and find some fuses missing. The are scared by Jeff and Neil, and in turn Jeff gets punched by Trish for scaring them. Trish forces them to re-install the fuses, making the lights in the house come on again and all of them go inside.Next door, Valerie hears a noise again and she sees both trash cans lying down on the ground. Courtney thinks that it just may be some stray dogs looking for food. Courtney looks through her bedroom window at Trish's house, curious about the party going on and she sees John pulling up on the driveway in his car. John honks his car horn and Diane comes out saying she cannot leave right now. John pulls his car into the garage.Meanwhile, Courtney suggests crashing Trish's party while Valerie brushes her hair. Valerie tells her sister that she just wants to be alone and does not feel very sociable. In Trish's garage, Diane and John are making out in his car while the others are inside. John suggests going over to his house for some intimate time and Diane goes in the house and tells Trish that she and John are going out for beer. Trish, aware that Diane only wants to go someplace to have sex with John, replies ""you don't have to ask my permission, Diane"". Diane returns to the car where she gets in the front seat only to find John's head falling off his body. She screams, but her screams are not heard because the girls inside are running a blender to make margaritas. Diane crawls out of the car and is killed by Thorn, who is still in the garage.Next door, Courtney thinks that she hears honking and screaming, but Valerie says that it's nothing. Courtney again asks Valerie if they could go over to the party, but Valerie again refuses. Courtney retreats to her bedroom while Valerie stays downstairs and turns on the living room TV to watch a movie.At Trish's house, the front doorbell rings and the group thinks its the pizza guy. Jeff asks through the door ""what's the damage?"" he hears a voice through the door saying ""six... so far"". Kim and Jackie are on the phone with Coach Jana to ask about an upcoming basketball game, and the front door is opened to find a dead pizza delivery guy, his eyes gorged out, who falls through the doorway and lands on the floor..... with the pizza still in his dead arms. The girls scream and Trish hangs up the phone to call the police, but Thorn cuts the phone lines. Coach Jana hears the screaming on the other line before she gets cut off. Jana tries calling the girls back, but there is no answer. Coach Jana calls Valerie suggesting checking out the house and she says that she will drive over there to help check it out herself.In Trish's house, Jeff and Neil arm themselves with kitchen knives and begin to lock all the doors and windows of the house. After a while, Jeff suggests that they make a run for it to get help. Neil decides to make a run for Valerie's house while Jeff will make a run for Mr. Contant's house to get to a phone. Trish and the girls reluctantly agree. Jeff goes out the back door while Neil runs out the front door. But by splitting up, the guys guarantee their own demise. Jeff has to run through the back yard and through the garage to get out the back way where he finds a dead Diane in the garage. Thorn is in the garage waiting for him and drills Jeff in the back. Thorn then runs after Neil who makes it to Valerie's front door and begins frantically knocking and screaming for help. But Valerie either ignores the knocking or doesn't hear it due to the loud television. Courtney doesn't hear Neil calling for help either because she is on her phone in her bedroom talking to a friend while playing loud rock music on her radio. Thorn approaches and attacks Neil in which he manages to twist the knife Neil has from his hands and gorily stabs the boy to death. When Valerie finally goes to the front door, she cannot see anything as Thorn is carrying Neil's dead body back to the garage and throws him in the trunk of John's car where the dead bodies of John, Mr. Contant, and Diane are stuffed in. Thorn counts the bodies and realizes that one is missing. It is Jeff, who despite being gravely wounded, is crawling back towards the back door.Inside, Trish, Diane, and Kim sit in a circle with knives in their hands. Jackie goes for the dead pizza boy's delivery and enjoys a slice of pizza. The girls hear the wounded Jeff scraching on the back door. But they are too afraid to open the door thinking that it might be a trick. Then they hear Thorn approach Jeff and drill him to death. Meanwhile, Coach Jana gets in her car and begins to drive over to Trish's house, while Valerie goes upstairs to find Courtney gone. Valerie sees her sister walking to Trish's house and runs after Courtney.Courtney sees Valerie approaching and ducks away from her by running around the side of the house. Valerie goes up to the front door and rings the doorbell and knocks on the front door. When she gets no reply, she leaves. Jackie runs to the front door from the kitchen to let Valerie in and when she opens it, Thorn is now standing there and swipes the drill across Jackie's neck, killing her. Trish and Kim run upstairs and barricade themselves in Trish's bedroom.Meanwhile, Valerie finds Courtney in the back of the house and she tells her that she does not think anyone is home after looking in the windows and seeing no one. Valerie tells her that she will check the front door again. She walks inside the house through the front door after finding it conspicuously wide open after knowing that the front door was closed and locked just a few minutes ago. Valerie calls out the girls' names, and, upstairs, Kim wants to respond, but Trish suggests that Valerie might be helping the killer. Looking around the downstairs and finding nobody in sight, Valerie walks out through the kitchen into the backyard to find Courtney gone.Upstairs in Trish's bedroom, Trish and Kim talk about what they are going to do, when Thorn sneaks in through a window and attacks them. Trish defends herself by knocking the driller killer down with a baseball bat and then tries moving the furniture away from the blocked door. But Thorn quickly revives and Kim attacks him with a knife. Thorn twists the knife out of Kim's hands and stabs her to death. Trish runs and hides in her parents' bedroom closet.While Thorn searches for Trish upstairs, Valerie goes outside and finds Courtney and they go back inside Trish's house where they find Kim's dead body in the refrigerator. (Note: there is a minor plot hole here as well as some cheating as one would wonder why in the world would the killer drag Kim, after having killed her upstairs, downstairs to the kitchen to stuff her into the refrigerator, and in such a short time). Both girls scream, and Thorn hears them. Valerie sees the shadow of Thorn on the stairway and hides in the basement while Courtney ducks under the living room couch. Thorn walks downstairs and looks around and sees no one. He closes the front door and drags the dead pizza guy away into the basement, while Valerie hides under the basement stairs. Then, for some odd reason, Thorn lies down on the living room floor and covers himself with a blanket.A few minutes later, Coach Jana arrives at the house and calls out the girls' names and walks inside. Courtney, still hiding under the living room couch just feet away from Thorn, Trish, still hiding upstairs, and Valerie, still hiding in the basement, do not call out in fear of being discovered by the killer. When Coach Jana approaches a figure, covered, on the living room floor, Thorn jumps up and goes after the coach with the drill while she defends herself with a fireplace poker. Courtney intervenes and trips Thorn, who gets beaten by the coach with the fireplace poker, and Trish runs in and stabs Thorn once in the back. He sits back up and slashes Coach Jana across the chest with the drill, killing her, and knocks Trish to the floor. Speaking for the first time, Thorn makes a remark to Trish how pretty she is and that all of her friends are very pretty. The driller killer tells Trish that ""it takes a lot of love for a person to do this.""Just then, Valerie runs up from the basement, wielding a large machete and swings it at Thorn who runs out the back door and stands by the backyard swimming pool while Valerie continues swinging the machete at him. With a powerful swing, Valerie chops off his drill bit and further attacks, chopping off Thorn's left hand and slashes him in the abdomen in which he falls into the pool. Valerie drops the machete and she and her sister embrace. Thorn crawls out of the pool and jumps atop Valerie to get at the machete. Courtney tries to stop him, but Thorn punches her in the face and knocks her aside. Trish runs out and attacks him again. Thorn knocks Trish down and jumps for Valerie, who grabs the machete, and he lands right on top of it. Thorn falls to the ground, dead at last. The shaken Trish, Valerie, and Courtney look on as police sirens are heard in the distance."
Swamp Thing,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084745/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a violent incident with a special chemical, a research scientist is turned into a swamp plant monster. Dr. Alec Holland, hidden away in the depths of a murky swamp, is trying to create a new species - a combination of animal and plant capable of adapting and thriving in the harshest conditions. Unfortunately he becomes subject of his own creation and is transformed . . . Arcane, desperate for the formula attempts to capture the Swamp Thing. An explosive chase ensues that ultimately ends with a confrontation between Holland and a changed Arcane . . .—Mark Harding <mah@imdb.com> After a scientist is mysteriously killed while assisting a top-secret bio-engineering project in the swamps of the American South, government worker Alice Cable arrives at the bogs to serve as his replacement. Alice immediately notices that one of the team's swamp sensors has malfunctioned, but her guide, Charlie, introduces her to Harry Ritter, the project supervisor. Charlie tells Ritter a rumour about an evil paramilitary leader named Anton Arcane, who intends to hijack their operation. While Charlie briefs Ritter on the situation, Alice introduces herself to Dr Linda Holland and her brother, lead scientist Dr Alec Holland, who takes her on a tour and encourages her to admire the beauty of the swamps.Upon returning to the site, however, Ritter and Charlie scold Alice for distracting Alec. When Alice mentions the broken sensor, Ritter reveals that her predecessor was attempting to repair it when he was killed. After noting the disappearance of one of their workers, the group hears a loud bang and returns to the laboratory, where Linda shows off her recent breakthrough: a glowing, plant-based concoction with explosive properties. Alec then shows Alice a hybrid plant and animal cell, his prized discovery. Sometime later, Alec notices that droplets of Linda's formula spawned rapid plant growth on the surfaces they touched. Overcome with excitement, Alec kisses Alice before sending her to retrieve Ritter in the control room. Although the room is empty, she sees security camera footage of Charlie being shot. Suddenly, a group of paramilitary agents attack her and raid Alec's laboratory. A man resembling Ritter steps forward, but pulls off his mask and reveals himself as Arcane. When Arcane shoots Linda for attempting to escape with the formula, Alec grabs the beaker, but trips, causing the spilt chemicals to set him on fire. He runs outside and dives into the swamp to extinguish the flames as a series of explosions burst from the water.Overnight, Arcane's henchmen destroy the premises and remove all evidence of the team's work. At dawn, a henchman captures Alice and attempts to drown her in the swamp, but a green, human-like creature drags her ashore and chases two of Arcane's men. Meanwhile, in his mansion, Arcane and his secretary realize that Alec's most recent notebook is missing from the plunder. Alice runs to a nearby gas station to telephone her employers for help; the operator connects to Ritter, who claims to have been called away from the site before the attack. After revealing she stole Alec's last notebook, Alice waits for Ritter's return alongside the young gas station attendant, Jude, but Arcane's men arrive and chase her through the forest. Suddenly, the Swamp Thing appears and again scares the pursuers away, immune to their gunfire. Once alone, Alice attempts to escape the monster, and it reluctantly trudges back into the trees. Jude finds Alice and leads her to a nearby cabin to change clothes. Later, Arcane instructs his men to find Alice, hoping she will lead them to the creature.Alice and Jude boat around the swamp until they reach the dock near the laboratory wreckage. She spies the Swamp Thing crouched among the ruins, holding Linda's locket, and quickly returns to the boat, vowing to bring Alec's final notebook to Washington, D.C. Minutes later, multiple boats of Arcane's men close in on Alice and Jude, luring the creature from its hiding place among the reeds. Despite their bullets and grenades, the Swamp Thing engineers an elaborate boat crash. Although concerned by its intelligence, Arcane orders his lead henchman, Bruno, to continue the search. Moments after instructing Jude to escape with Alec's notebook, Alice hears the boy cry out in distress, but she is kidnapped before she can reply. The Swamp Thing finds Jude's lifeless body and presses a hand against his head, creating a greenish glow that instantly revives him. Regaining consciousness, Jude realizes the creature is a friend of Alice's and gives it the notebook for safekeeping. On Arcane's boat, Alice throws her kidnapper, Ferret, overboard, then dives into the water and swims ashore. Once on land, Alice bumps into the Swamp Thing, which calls out her name. Ferret chops off the Swamp Thing's arm with a machete, but the creature easily snaps Ferret's neck, causing Alice to faint. She awakens in the monster's embrace as it presents her with an orchid plant. The Swamp Thing speaks to her, and she recognizes it as Alec. Later, she strips naked and goes skinny dipping in the water as the monster paces along the banks. After Alice dresses, Arcane's men follow her, capture the Swamp Thing in a net, and retrieve the final notebook.That evening, Arcane invites Alice to a formal dinner party celebrating his duplication of the Hollands' formula. Moments after giving a toast to prospective immortality, Arcane reveals that he secretly slipped the first dose to Bruno, who begins to convulse. The hulking man's body shrinks to half its size as he grows pointed ears and a misshapen skull. Arcane locks him in a dungeon alongside the Swamp Thing, asking the latter creature why the experiment failed. The Swamp Thing reveals that the formula does not produce strength, but instead amplifies a person's natural qualities, explaining that Bruno's timidity caused his diminished stature.After locking Alice in the dungeon with them, Arcane returns to his study and drinks a glass of the formula. A beam of sunlight emitted through the door re-grows the Swamp Thing's missing arm, allowing the creature to free itself, Alice, and Bruno. Upstairs, Arcane transforms into a hairy, boar-like beast, and descends to the dungeons. There, he discovers that his captives have escaped through an underwater tunnel leading back to the swamp. Sometime later, Alice and the Swamp Thing emerge from the water, followed closely by Arcane's monster, which stabs Alice with a sword.

With Argento's trademark visual style, linked with one of his more coherent plots, Tenebrae follows a writer who arrives to Rome only to find somebody is using his novels as the inspiration (and, occasionally, the means) of committing murder. As the death toll mounts the police are ever baffled, and the writer becomes more closely linked to the case than is comfortable.—David Carroll <davidc@atom.ansto.gov.au> The successful American writer from Rhode Island Peter Neal travels from New York to Rome to promote his new best-seller Tenebre.

He meets Peter and tells that the killer was inspired by his novel to commit the crime. Peter receives a letter from the murderer and sooner two lesbians are murdered. The killer writes that perverts must be eliminated and Peter suspects of the host of his show. However, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains might be the truth.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is an American writer of violent horror novels whose books are tremendously popular in Europe. In Italy to promote his latest work, entitled Tenebrae, he is accompanied by his literary agent Bullmer (John Saxon) and his adoring assistant Anne (Daria Nicolodi). He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario).Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D'Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover by the unseen killer who has a straight-razor blade. Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the teenage daughter of Neal's landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an ax after stumbling into the killer's lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist's work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Berti's house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an ax-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer's face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn outside the open front door, claiming to have been knocked out from behind.The next day, Giermani's investigation of the crime scene reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal's novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square.That evening, Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Berti's house during the night of the interviewer's murder. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers what was so important: he had heard Berti confessing to his unseen attacker, ""I killed them all, I killed them all!"" Before Gianni can share this important detail with anyone, he is attacked from the back seat of his car and strangled to death by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile, Jane sits at her kitchen table when a figure with an ax leaps through her window, hacking off one of her arms. She spews gallons of blood over the kitchen walls before falling to the floor, the killer continuing to hack at her until she is dead. Neal is revealed to be her killer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal had suddenly been overwhelmed by a forgotten memory involving Neal's murder of a young woman (Eva Robbins) who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in Rhode Island. The memory now constantly torments him and has inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood. Neal has become completely insane. Berti was the killer of Tilde, Maria, and all the other women by razor, but it was Neal who killed Berti, along with Bullmer, Gianni and Jane.When Inspector Altieri arrives at the house a few minutes after Jane's death, Neal kills her too. Later, Giermani and Anne arrive at the house in the pouring rain, and when Neal sees that he cannot escape, he commits bloody suicide in front of them by slashing his neck with a straight razor. Anne runs outside to her car for a moment. Giermani relaxes and is suddenly murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door and just at Neal is about to kill her too with the ax, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills the demented writer. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams over and over again."

However, when Subject 20 becomes deadly, the best troubleshooter in the Galaxy is called in to investigate.—Concorde - New Horizons (with permission). The Federation agent Mike Colby is sent to the remote planet Xarbia to attend the call of scientists. Mike learns that the lethal genetic experiment Subject 20 that was created by the scientists has become dangerous. Mike wants to terminate Subject 20, but the responsible for the facility, Dr. Gordon Hauser, is reluctant to destroy the experiment. However, when Subject 20 gets loose from his cage, he begins to kill the personal of the facility.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An experimental life-form mutates rapidly and uncontrollably and kills all of the laboratory subject animals before cocooning itself within an examination booth located on the remote desert planet. A military officer and his AI robot soldier is called in to terminate the alien but he is obstructed by the scientists n staff of the laboratory.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com Inside a traveling spacecraft, a robot pilot at the controls called SAM-104 (Don Olivera) approaches Mike Colby (Jesse Vint), who is encased, unconscious, in a glass chamber in a form of hibernation stasis. As the man awakens, the robot informs him that the ship is under attack. Mike and SAM-104 escape by firing missiles at the encroaching raiders. The robot tells him that the Federation has extended Mike's mission, diverting them to the planet Xarbia to repair a security lab. They jump into hyperspace and arrive at the station on the surface of Xarbia, a desert-like planet with two orbiting suns.Inside, Mike meets Dr. Gordon Hauser (Linden Chiles) and Dr. Barbara Glaser (June Chadwick), then turns off SAM-104's controls. The doctors explain that they conduct bacteriological genetic engineering experiments and have successfully created a new food source. When Mike bumps into crew member Tracy Baxter (Dawn Dunlap), Gordon asks her to find their colleague, Jimmy Swift (Michael Bowen), and bring him to the laboratory. In the lab, Mike meets Dr. Cal Tinburgen (Fox Harris), head of bacteriology, and observes the piles of bloody rabbit carcasses strewn across the floor. They tell him that an octopus-like ""metamorphic mutant"" called Subject 20, which continuously alters its genetic makeup to change forms, caused the damage. The so-called Subject 20 is seen in one of the glass cages covered in a type of cocoon. Mike proposes they kill the creature, but Barbara convinces him to wait.As Tracy joins Mike, the doctors, and crew members Earl Richards (Scott Paulin) and Brian Beale (Raymond Oliver) for dinner, Jimmy cleans the lab and notices that the creature's breathing in the cocoon increases. Gordon calls Jimmy on the intercom to inform him that the behavior is normal, but sends Tracy back to investigate. A slimy, black blob emerges from Subject 20 and attacks Jimmy. Meanwhile, the doctors explain that their experiments involve a substance called Proto-B, the genes of which they spliced with a fast-growing alga. When Mike asks what was spliced with Proto-B to create Subject 20, Barbara mentions a deceased crew member named Annie, but no one elaborates further. They receive a distress signal from Tracy, who discovered Jimmy's body in the lab with his brain missing, but his heart still beating. While Cal brings the corpse into the medical bay, Barbara gives her condolences to Tracy.That night, Earl watches security camera footage of Barbara and Mike making love before noticing an alarm warning. He descends to a darkened corridor, where the monster attacks him. Meanwhile, Cal injects medicine into his torso as he sits and watches Jimmy's skin and muscle rapidly turn to gelatin.The next morning, Mike walks in on Tracy sitting naked, taking a steam bath. As he undresses, the monster attacks, but they escape. The creature breaks through the sauna skylight, and Mike announces that he, Gordon, Brian, and SAM-104 will follow it outside. The men put on protective spacesuits, and Gordon explains that they only have an hour before the atmosphere will cause the nitrogen in their blood to froth. In the lab, Barbara and Cal watch as the gelatinous pile divides in two.On the desert surface of Xarbia, Brian finds Earl's decomposing body near the mutant's latest cocoon. The men shoot at the sac with a laser gun, but discover it is empty. Near the station, they see the monster, which has morphed into a large, black, tentacled creature with a gaping mouth. The mutant swallows Gordon whole and dives down one of the station's vents into the control room, destroying all the computers. Cal realizes that the creature is creating permanent food supply by injecting the humans' bodies with Proto-B, causing them to infinitely split and reproduce. Gordon, deformed and nearly dead, stumbles into the room and falls to the ground. Cal explains that Gordon spliced his own cells with Proto-B, which were then used to fertilize an egg that was implanted into Annie's uterus. Subject 20 grew so quickly, however, that it killed her two weeks later.Meanwhile in the showers, Barbara tells Tracy that they need to communicate with the creature instead of attacking it. As the men brainstorm ways to kill the mutant, the two women enter the control room. Realizing that the creature can understand her and has wired itself into the computer system, Barbara uses the keyboard to ask it if it can co-exist with humans. In response, Subject 20 stabs her with its tentacle. Tracy runs to tell the men that Barbara was killed, and Mike and Brian follow her back to the control room. SAM-104 reveals that it knows Cal has cancer; Cal injects his cancerous cells into a sample of Gordon's mutating tissue. He then uses lasers to blast the remainder of the monster's food supply before joining Brian and Mike in the control room. The creature's cocoon emits a liquid onto the control boards, which electrocutes Brian. Cal attempts to kill the creature, but a tentacle smashes into his head.Accompanied by SAM-104, Mike carries the injured doctor into another lab room, where Cal instructs him to cut out his liver tumor and feed it to the mutant. Tracy runs to Cal's room to get his morphine supply. On her way back, the monster chases her through the halls. Unable to wait for the morphine, Mike performed the crude surgery to remove the cancer. Just then, Tracy returns to the lab after being chased by the monster and gives the morphine to Cal. Just as Mike removes the large tumor on Cal's liver, Cal dies. Just then, the monster, Subject 20, breaks into the lab and attacks. Mike attempts to feed the monster the tumor without getting eaten himself, while SAM-104 shoots at the monster with its ray gun without success. SAM-104 then takes a scalpel blade off a table and stabs the monster in its right eye, but the monster uses one of its tentacles to hit SAM-104 with such force that the robot is flung against a wall and breaks into several pieces. Just then, Mike manages to get the creature to eat the malignant tumor. The monster quickly reacts by vomiting violently and collapses to the floor. As the monster finally dies in a slow and clearly agonizing death, Mike and Tracy stand among the carnage, remembering their fellow crew members that died in the struggle."
The New York Ripper,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084719/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A burned-out New York police detective teams up with a college psychoanalyst to track down a vicious serial killer randomly stalking and killing various young women around the city. Killer who talks like a duck wanders around New York City killing women by various means including slicing an eyeball with a razorblade. Detective Jack Headly is hot on his trail.—Humberto Amador A blade-wielding psychopath is on the loose, turning The Big Apple bright red with the blood of beautiful young women. As NYPD detective Fred Williams (Jack Hedley of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY) follows the trial of butchery from the decks of the Staten Island Ferry to the sex shows of Times Square, each brutal murder becomes a sadistic taunt. In the city that never sleeps, the hunt is on for the killer that can't be stopped.—James Lohmann When the dog of an old man finds a decomposed hand in New York, the police identifies the victim as the model Ann-Lyne. Lt. Fred Williams is assigned to investigate the crime and is informed by Ann-Lyne's landlady that she had received a phone call from a man that spoke like a duck. While going to Staten Island, the bicycle rider Rosie is stabbed to death in the ferry by a man with duck-like voice. Lt. Williams teams-up with the psychologist Dr. Paul Davis to hunt down the serial-killer. Meanwhile other women are attacked by the murderer. When the beautiful Fay Majors survives the attack of the man, Lt. Williams and Dr. Davis have a lead to be followed but Dr. Davis questions whether the identified man is the killer since he believes the serial-killer has another profile.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil New York City. An old man walking his pet dog in waste ground near the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge along the East River waterfront in Brooklyn, is horrified when his dog retrieves a decomposed human hand. It is identified by the police as belonging to Ann-Lynne, a local prostitute.At a police station, Lieutenant Fred Williams (Jack Hedley), the middle-aged, burned-out police detective investigating the murder, interviews the young woman's nosy and obnoxious landlady, Mrs. Weissburger (Babette New), who tells the police detective that during her daily spying and eavesdropping on her tenants, she overheard the girl last week over the phone arranging to meet a man who spoke with a strange, duck-like voice.Meanwhile, a young woman (Cinzia De Ponti) rides her bicycle down Manhattan to the Staten Island Ferry at Battery Park. After an altercation with a boorish motorist driving a red Volkswagen, whose car she accidentally scratched riding her bicycle, she rides onto the boat with the man yelling misogynist slurs at her. When the ferry is underway, the young woman sneaks into the car-bay and begins vandalizing the man's car, but she is interrupted by an unseen figure. Introducing herself as Rosie, she tries to engage the man in a conversation. But the figure adopts a grotesque 'Donald Duck' voice and brutally murders her with a switchblade knife, stabbing and disemboweling her, and leaving her body to be discovered when the ferry docks at Staten Island.At the morgue, Lt. Williams talks to Barry Jones the pathologist (Giordano Falzoni), who believes he recognizes the style of the killing and links it to Ann-Lynne, as well as a similar case in Harlem the previous month.Having informed the press that a serial killer is at large, Williams is visited at the station by New York's chief of police (Lucio Fulci). Williams' skeptical superior tells him not to make any further public announcements about the case to avoid starting a city-wide panic. Soon after the police chief leaves, Williams is notified that a man ""sounding like a duck"" phoned while he was out at the press conference wanting to speak with him.Williams travels to Columbia University where he meets with a brilliant young psychotherapy professor named Dr. Paul Davis (Paolo Malco) for help in creating a profile of the killer. He is surprised that the young genius not only agrees to help with the case, but has already anticipated his motive for wanting to speak with him.That night in New York's red-light district, Jane Lodge (Alessandra Delli Colli), an attractive, well-dressed woman in a chic raincoat and derby hat, attends a live sex show. She is recording the simulated moans and groans of the two performers with a pocket tape recorder. A scruffy, dangerous looking man (Howard Ross), sitting a few rows behind her, and with two fingers missing from his right hand, observes what she's doing. After the show has ended, the female performer (Zora Kerowa) retires backstage to her dressing room only to find it totally dark. Hearing a noise, she opens a closet door and is brutally attacked by the maniac, who disembowels her by shoving a broken and jagged liquor bottle from her crotch to her abdomen.Later that night, at the home of Kitty (Daniela Doria), a prostitute regularly visited by Williams, he receives a taunting phone call from the duck-voiced killer saying that he has killed again. The detective is perplexed; how does the manic know he's there?The next day, Jane shows her latest tape recording to her husband Dr. Lodge (Laurence Welles), who has agreed to support their open-marriage. Later, Jane goes to a bar in a rough neighborhood in the Lower East Side where she's approached by two rough, Hispanic bar punks who proceed to fondle and sexually humiliate her right at the bar. After allowing herself to be taken advantage of, the emotionally troubled Jane runs out of the bar and drives away.That night, Fay Majors (Almanta Keller), a casually dressed young woman, is riding alone on a late-night subway train when she gets menaced by the same ominous man from the porno theater. Fleeing from the perceived threat, she runs off the train, through the deserted subway station, and onto the street where she gets attacked in a dark alley by the quacking maniac, who brutally stabs her in the leg and slashes her hands and arms as she tries to defend herself. Limping away, Fay stumbles through a doorway into a seedy apartment building where she closes and locks the door behind her so the killer won't follow. Fay passes out from the loss of blood, and then realty and illusion blur: Fay is sitting alone in a dark movie theater watching cartoons when she attacked and killed by a different, handsome young man who slashes her neck with a straight razor.Fay wakes up the hospital the morning after when the same man visits her in her room. The man is revealed to be her physicist boyfriend Peter Bunch (Andrew Painter), who is relived that she has survived the attack. Lt. Williams and Dr. Davis visit Fay where she tells them about her attacker who was missing two fingers from his right hand. Williams and Davis both conclude that this is the killer since all forensic evidence points to the killing being left-handed.Somewhere in night-time New York, the owner of his mutilated right hand picks up Jane and takes her to the sleazy Cavalier Hotel room on 34th Street for some bondage sex. He ties up the semi-nude woman to the bed. The S&M game she has willingly begun turns nasty when he begins to beat her without provocation. Then, the man turns up the radio really loud, and makes a muttered phone-call, describing the bound woman to someone on the other line as ""she's right up your perverted alley."" A little later, while the man sleeps, Jane overhears a radio DJ describing the killer, whom the press has now dubbed, 'the New York Ripper' and missing two fingers from his right hand. Jane carefully and quietly unties herself from the bed and flees into the hotel hallway, only to be killed by the real New York Ripper who stabs her to death in ultra-gory fashion.Williams arrives at the scene of the crime where the police find Jane's tape recordings of the sex shows and of her 'master.' Learning from witnesses, Williams discovers that the identity of the man is Mickey Scellenda, a Greek immigrant with a history of sexual assault and drug abuse. Williams and the police step up the search for Scellenda after raiding his apartment, finding photographs of most of the Ripper victims and huge stashes of pornography. Williams also pays a visit to Dr. Lodge to inform him of his wife's murder. Dr. Lodge tearfully defends his open marriage which gets him a sneering response from the 'moralistic' Williams.Meanwhile, Dr. Davis begins to express doubt to the killer's identity for Mickey Scellenda is only a petty criminal with a low intelligence quota, not the high intelligence that Davis has created in profiling the New York Ripper. Davis then buys a gay porno magazine at a local news stand (giving away his repressed homosexuality), and then pays a visit to Peter and Fay at their pleasant, well-appointed row house to ask them more questions about Fay's experience. Something about their story arouses his professional suspicious. That evening, after Peter goes out, Fay is attacked in their house by Scellenda who breaks in trying to kill her. But she is saved when Peter returns, and the man flees.A few days later, Williams gets another taunting phone call from the New York Ripper, who wants to ""dedicate a murder to him."" Williams and the police put a trace on the line and race to the location, only to find that the killer has set up a two-way radio to a remote phone booth, while he, is at that moment, in the home of Kitty, brutally torturing her by slowly running a razor over her face. Williams races to Kitty's apartment, but is way too late as the killer has fled, leaving behind Kitty's horribly mutilated body to be discovered.A while later, the dead body of Mickey Scellenda is found having committed suicide from self-suffocation. When Dr. Barry Jones informs Williams that Scellenda was dead for the last eight days, four days before Kitty's murder, Williams finally realizes that they have been tailing the wrong man.Williams relays this to Professor Davis, who is both delighted and disappointed with the news. Davis explains that with Scellenda eliminated as a suspect, his original idea to the killer's identity is confirmed; a deeply disturbed person, with a high IQ, who blames women for his or her troubles, and used Scellenda to pick out his victims. When Davis explains his suspicious about Peter and Fay, Williams decides to have them followed.Fay is shown visiting a hospital where Peter has a child from a previous marriage, a little girl named Suzy, who is dying from a rare bone disorder that has led to the amputation of her left arm and right leg. But is the killer Peter or Fay? Visiting the hospital, Williams and Davis observe little Suzy in her hospital bed and decide to race over to Peter and Fay's place to arrest both of them.At Peter and Fay's house, one of them gets a phone call from a duck-voiced person, while the other one overhears. When Peter goes into the kitchen for dinner, Fay has disappeared. Going upstairs to Suzy's bedroom, Fay jumps out of the darkness at Peter stabbing him with a kitchen knife. Suddenly, Peter rises, quacking like a duck, and struggles with Fay in which they both tumble down the stairs. Just as Peter grabs the knife away from Fay and about to stab her, Williams runs in and literally blasts Peter's face off with one shot from his gun.In the ambulance, Davis explains to Fay her deranged boyfriend's motivation for killing. His hatred of sexually active women stemmed from bitterness at the cruel blow fate had dealt his young daughter, who will never enjoy the freedoms of his despised victims. After leaving the scene, the phone in the now-deserted house rings again. In her hospital bed, little Suzy is calling out for her father pleading to answer her call, as her voice is drowned beneath the everyday traffic of the city."

A parody/homage to Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance, The Pirate Movie is a comedy/musical utilizing both new songs and parodies from the original, as well as references to popular films of the time, including Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. In your typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights girl with swords plot, the story revolves around Mabel, the youngest of Maj. Gen. Stanley's many daughters, and Frederic, an ex-Pirate of Penzance. They fall in love and proceed to retrieve the Stanleys' fortune from the Pirates (stolen 20 years ago). The Pirate King informs Frederic that since he was a Leap Year baby born on February 29, Frederic is still technically the King's apprentice. Frederic must then decide between duty and honor--the only good qualities the King taught him- and true love.—Todd Kogutt: SCAVENGER The Pirate Movie is the celluloid version of Gilbert and Sullivan's famous musical, the Pirates of Penzance.The movie begins with a pirate actor (Christopher Atkins) meeting a group of young women at one of his preformances. He invites one mousy young girl named Mable (Kristy McNichol) to go for a ride on his boat and bring some of her friends. Her friends take off with the actor and without her. In her desperate attempt to catch up with them she falls into the water and is knocked unconscious. She then begins to dream about the young man she met.The dream sequence opens with a fight between two pirate ships. We are introduced to Fredric (Christopher Atkins) who is celebrating his 21st Birthday and at the end of his apprenticeship as a pirate.At this time, Fredric expresses his view that his fellow pirates are rather pathetic at their chosen profession because they release ships they capture when the occupants are orphans. This ""soft spot"" arises from the apparent fact that the pirates of penance are also all orphans. Fredric goes on to state that he wishes to give up his life as a pirate and devote himself to ending the pirates' reign. He is then cast off the ship in a dingey.After the argument, a group of women run onto the beach and Fredric, having never seen a woman other than Ruth (Maggie Kirkpatrick) before in his life, does not know how to approach them and scares all but one of them away. Mable and Fredric converse and quickly fall in love.Fredric warns Mable of pirates near by but before they can run away, the pirates capture them and they intend to marry the girls and take them away aboard their ship. But Mable warns the pirates that their father is a Major General and he emerges on the scene a short time later.Having heard of the pirates of penzance and their ""soft spot"", the Major-General (Bill Kerr) pretends that he was an orphan and the pirates agree to release the group of girls. The pirates remain docked near by.Mable and Frederic wish to be married. Unfortunately, there is a custom that requires the girls to marry in the order in which they were born. Mable has to be last. Her father also requests that the man she marry have money, which he does not have. Mable convinces her father to allow the marraige if Frederic recovers the treasure that was stolen from him by the pirates. Mable and Frederic sneak aboard the ship to abtain the map of the treasures location, which is tatood on the captains back. The recovery of the treasure wins Frederic the right to lead forces against the pirates impending attack.When Frederic is later alone, he is confronted by the Pirate King (Ted Hamilton) and Ruth and they inform him that he's not actually 21 years of age because he was born in a leap year on 29 February and since his birthday only happens every four years, it will be another 60 years before he is actually 21. Fredric is convinced by Ruth and the Pirate King and agrees to rejoin the pirates because it is his duty. He then informs the Pirate King of the plans that the Major General has for the arrest of the pirates, to which the Pirate King vowes revenge.Frederic then encounters Mabel and she pleads with him to stay. But to no avail and he stands by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday. He promises to return when his duty of service is over, but they will be very old then. In the meantime he must fight on the side of the pirates.Mable informs the police that they will have to face the pirates without Fredric's assistance and that she will lead them. During this conversation, the pirates approach the Major-General's house. As the pirates approach, the police quickly hide in fear. (Note - the police are comically portrayed as tough talkers who exhibit fear and cowardliness when conflict is near).As the conflict between the police and pirates grows, the conflict between the two lovers causes them to become enemies. As the Major-General quietly reflects on his guilt and conscience, the pirates launch an attack and the police rush to the Major-General's defense. But the police (who are only aided by the daughters) are defeated (comically) and the Pirate King imposes a sentence of death on the the captured Major General and the girls will be taken captive. They are interrupted by Mable's realization that it is her dream and she wants a happy ending. Mable matches up all her sisters with a pirate or a police officer.The pirates and the young daughters are all joined together. Frederic and Mabel are reunited and married with the consent and pleasure of the Major-General and he consents to the ""noble pirates"" marrying his daughters.Mable awakes from her dream in time to be rescued by the pirate actor she met on the pier (Christopher Atkins). They lived happily ever after and singing all the way."
Piranha II: The Spawning,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082910/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A scuba diving instructor, her biochemist boyfriend, and her police chief ex-husband try to link a series of bizarre deaths to a mutant strain of piranha fish whose lair is a sunken freighter ship off a Caribbean island resort. A sunken US supply ship off a Caribbean island resort is the focus for a series of mysterious piranha attacks. Investigating the death of one of her son's companions after a scuba-diving trip, Anne Kimbrough breaks into the morgue with holidaymaker Tyler Sherman, only to discover that the fish have wings and can fly. But the hotel manager refuses to call off the annual fish fry on the beach, with inevitable consequences...—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> In a Caribbean island, a couple is found dead inside a sunken ship. The scuba diving instructor of the local resort Anne Kimbrough breaks in the morgue with her acquaintance Tyler Sherman and finds that the bodies have been eaten in many parts. They have one night stand and Tyler tells her that he is a biochemist that have developed a specimen of genetically modified piranha capable of flying to be the ultimate weapon. Unfortunately they had lost a cylinder full of the new breed in the water. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas attack the guests. Anne and Tyler decide to explode the ship to destroy the nest of the predator.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Off the coast of a Caribbean island, a young couple, Lou and Lisa, flee the hotel in the middle of the night to have sex in the sea. But they swim into a sunken wreck which is also a piranha lair and they are both killed and eaten by the unseen piranha.The next day, a group of tourists, including Tyler Sherman (Steve Marachuk), are taking the diving courses provided by Anne Kimbrough (Tricia O'Neil), an employee of the Hotel Elysium. One of her divers swims into the wreck, which she has strictly forbidden to her divers. Leaving Tyler to take over and lead the others to the surface, she discovers almost immediately that her 'missing' student has swam into the wreck and been killed there when his badly chewed up body is found.Anne's estranged husband, Steve (Lance Henriksen), a police officer, refuses to listen to Anne about her wanting to have a look at the body, because she needs to know what happened. The death does not seem to match the attack pattern by any of the marine life in this area, which she knows better than anyone. For her not to know what killed a diver is a dangerous sign. Steve intercepts Gabby (Ancil Gloudon), a dynamite fisherman, and his teenage son, and threatens to confiscate their boat, but as Gabby explains, Steve, Anne, and he, are old friends.Meanwhile, as the guests begin to flirt with each other (a middle-aged widow, named Beverly, flirts with a younger man, named Leo, who is a dentist), a pair of young women, named Jai and Loretta, arrive at the resort on a large sailboat. By their own admission, they are ""sea bandits"". Jai sneaks into the kitchen to steal food, but is intercepted by Mal (Arnie Ross), a mentally-challenged cook. She flirts with him, and he offers instead to make her a wonderful dinner. But as he goes to their boat with the meal, they take the meal and then undock, letting the boat drift. They try to convince him to jump, and he tries, and fails, so they mock him and sail off. That night, Jai and Loretta sail too far out, and are attacked by the piranha, who have developed the power to fly. Jai is attacked and her throat ripped out while Loretta falls into the water and gets eaten alive by the fish in the water.Worried about what's going on, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by Tyler Sherman, and so she takes him with her to the morgue in town to get a look at the body. It is revealed there that she became a marine biologist before she married Steve, and so she begins taking pictures. There, she finds that the body of the tourist has been eaten in many parts. A nurse comes in, kicks them out, and ends up quickly dead, for a piranha was hiding in the body and escaped in it. Armed with the power to fly, it kills the nurse by biting her throat out and escapes out a window into the night.In her hurry, Anne left her credit card behind at the scene. Anne and Tyler have a one night stand back in her room. But the next morning, while he sleeps, she begins to study the pictures, and is horrified by what she discovers. Steve arrives, throwing the credit card at her, angry first that she went to the morgue in defiance of him, and secondly that she has man in her bed. She tries to warn him of what she's discovered, but he ignores her and thinks she's a murderess.Anne tries to tell Raoul (Ted Richert) the pompous hotel manager, that she's canceling the dives because it isn't safe. Raoul at first pretends to be concerned, but swiftly fires her, thinking she is crazy. Attempting to capture one for further study, or at the very least take some pictures so she can prove what she's trying to tell Steve and the manager, she is intercepted by Tyler, who swiftly informs her that he is a biochemist and member of a team which has developed the ultimate weapon: a specimen of genetically modified piranha, with some other fish's genes intermixed, capable of flying. Earlier, and unfortunately, the team mistakenly deposited (or lost) a cylinder full of these fish when a cargo ship was sunk the water where the dead couple were found.Aaron provides the proof Anne needs to Steve, calling him and showing him, not merely some flying piranha he's recently caught, and never seen before, but also that they're a serious danger, because they're turning on each other. This is a sign that they're running out of food and will soon attack whatever they come near, including humans.At a meeting, Anne tries her best to reason with Raoul, to no avail. Steve surprises her, standing up for her and proving her case for her by throwing the body of a dead piranha onto the table. Steve tells her that she can't trust Tyler, because the army says he's crazy. She argued that Tyler's just been using her to get the message of the piranha out for him, to protect both himself and the residents of the hotel.Later that evening, a piranha attacks Gabby's son and kills him in his shack, leaving a bereft Gabby to vow revenge by killing the fish in the wreck they hide in. Anne tries to dissuade him, but it's too late. Having ignored Anne's advice, Raoul hosts a nighttime fish party to capture grunion, who come up to the beach to spawn at this time, making them easy prey for humans to capture and kill. Unfortunately for the residents, the piranha are also partially grunion and share the same instinct. During the fishing party promoted by the resort, the piranhas fly out of the water and attack the guests on the beach and at the hotel's courtyard pool. Anne leads those who survive into hotel, where they shut the doors and windows. Gabby tries to attack them, but they overwhelm and kill him as well.In the morning, the piranha withdraw, for Anne had discovered that they are not fond of daylight. Tyler and Anne decide to undertake Gabby's plan, and blow up the ship to destroy the predators. Meanwhile, the situation gets even tenser, for not merely can the piranha fly, but Anne and Steve's teenage son Chris (Ricky G. Paull) has been hired, against their wishes, by a local ship 'Captain', and his lovely daughter Allison (Leslie Graves). Chris and Allison sail away, and strand themselves on an island, leaving them vulnerable to piranha attacks that never actually happen. Getting lost at sea, they try to set sail again, heading straight toward the wreck.When Chris and Allison are stranded in a raft above the shipwreck, Annie and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and don scuba gear to dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Aaron left behind. With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. On the surface, Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. With minutes left to spare before the bomb explodes, Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler sacrifices himself to allow Anne to escape out of a porthole and to tie a survival rope around her waste allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. At the last second, Anne gets clear and the bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and the piranha with it. With all the murderous fish dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve and the two kids in their boat."

Shepard brings Jimmy to a cafe and coerces him into telling him the location.Sometime later, Jimmy and Shepard lead a squad of policemen to the top of the Chrysler Building, where they shoot the egg.

But soon they hear strange noises around the house and they have a night of panic.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A man named Preacher (Martin Landau) walks into Mom's Diner on a snowy evening, sits at the counter, and orders ""the usual"". An unattractive fish on a platter is brought to him and Leo Bain (Donald Pleasence) the chef, comes out from the back and begins talking to him. It starts to rain right inside the diner. Preacher is hoisted up on chains and Bain swings a cane knife as Preacher sits up in his bed and screams. It was all a nightmare he is having while residing in a insane asylum.The next day, Dr. Dan Potter (Dwight Schultz) arrives at the hospital to see the clinic director Dr. Leo Bain, and Bain hugs him even though they have never met. Bain is apparently just as crazy as most of the patients at the hospital. At home later, Dan is moving things into his new house with his wife Nell (Deborah Hedwall) and their 11-year-old daughter Lyla (Elizabeth Ward). That night at the hospital, one of the patients, Frank Hawkes (Jack Palance) gets out up of bed, places his hands near a window, causing a gate to shut and an alarm to go off.The next day, Dan arrives back at the hospital to meet with Bain again where Bain introduces Dan to his patients kept on the maximum security third floor, whom Bain calls ""voyagers"". They include Hawkes, a former World War II P.O.W. who went insane and was committed for fighting and nearly killing a few recent Vietnam War P.O.W.s out of anger and frustration. The other is Byron Sutcliff, ""Preacher"", a former priest who was committed for setting fire to and burning down three churches believing himself to be a messenger from God. Ronald ""Fatty"" Elster (Erland Van Lidth) is a 370-pound child molester and pedophile. John Skagg, ""the Bleeder"" (Phillip Clark) is a murderer who was committed for strangling two women and who gets nosebleeds whenever he kills. Skagg refuses to show his face before Dan. Dan tells the group that the previous doctor, Harry Merton, had to leave, but Hawkes expresses suspicion and hostility towards Dan. That night, Hawkes tells the others that he thinks Dan has killed Merton and believes that Dan intends to kill them. Hawkes tells them that they must break out somehow and kill Dan.The next day, Ray Curtis (Brent Jennings) the lead orderly on the third floor, tells Dan that the four voyagers want to kill him for his stern rules and says that they are ""intense"". Ray pushes a button that shuts a steel door to his office and he tells the doctor that electricity is the only thing that separates him and the voyagers.Outside in the gated courtyard where the patients intermingle, Preacher asks Bain for a match and he uses it to set his suit coat on fire and swings it at people. Dan tries to stop him, but Preacher only pushes him aside in anger. Bain walks up to Preacher and whispers something in his ear which calms him down. Bain tells Dan that he told Preacher that he threatened to hoist him up and ""cut him in half"" every time his misbehaves. In Dan's office, Ronald sneaks in and finds a letter address to Dan and a framed picture of Nell and Lyla. Meanwhile, Dan goes to speak with Hawkes about Merton, and Hawkes says he knows the doctor is somewhere in nearby Philadelphia.Dan arrives home that afternoon and he meets his visiting younger sister Toni (Lee Taylor-Allan) who arrives for a visit. Toni invites them all to a rock concert in town and during the drive, Nell lets Toni in about the patients Dan is treating and also lets Toni know why John Skagg is called the Bleeder. At a nightclub, Dan, Nell, and Toni arrive and watch a punk rock band named the Sick Fucks perform. Dan certainly does not enjoy the music. Suddenly, the electricity for the place goes out. The crowd heads outside and sees that there is a blackout.In the hospital, Preacher sits up in his bed claiming ""I made the lights go out!"" Hawkes puts his hands near the window, and neither the gate nor alarm are active, so the four voyagers walk out of the room. Preacher and Ronald find Ray hiding in a closet in his office, and after Preacher punches and kicks him a number of times for his abuse, Ronald picks up Ray and breaks his back. The group walks outside where the hulking Ronald punches through a car window to get at a doctor attempting to drive away and throws him out. The four psychopaths drive away in the doctor's car.At a nearby shopping center, the four voyagers arrive where a mob of looters have broken into several stores. Entering a sporting goods store packed with more looters, the four escaped maniacs don new clothes for themselves and arm themselves with a variety of weapons. Hawkes takes a crossbow with several arrows, plus a few handguns. Preacher takes a large Bowie knife and a double-bladed axe. Ronald takes only a baseball bat, and Skagg dons a hockey mask with a gardening fork. Outside, Skagg ""The Bleeder"" swipes a man with the gardening fork, killing him, and apparently disturbing the other voyagers so much that they get into the dead guy's van and drive off, leaving the Bleeder behind.The next day, Dan arrives at the hospital to learn from Bain about the four escaped patients and of the people they killed. With the power still off from an apparent statewide power outage, Dan has to report to the police about the four maniacs on the loose. In a nearby neighborhood, Hawkes, Preacher, and Ronald are driving around and torment a bicycle messenger and when the man mouths off to them, calling Hawkes an ""asshole"" the enraged Hawkes throws the van in reverse and plows into the bicycle messenger.At Dan's house, Preacher arrives wearing the bicycle messenger's hat and uniform and tells Nell claiming that he has a telegram for the doctor. Nell offers to take it, but Preacher says that he will come back later. Nell is slightly spooked by Preacher's strange behavior. After Preacher leaves, Toni tells Nell to accompany her to an anti-nuclear protest that is going on in town.A little later, after Toni and Nell leave, Lyla comes home to a vacant house, and Ronald is there, claiming to be her babysitter. Ronald is friendly towards Lyla, but she is a little unsettled by his strange behavior. Ronald suggests going to Lyla's room to show her what he can do with cut-out paper.Meanwhile, Toni and Nell are in jail having been arrested with dozens of other protesters. Toni meets a certain Tom Smith, one of those arrested with them during the demonstration. When it is time to make their phone calls, Tom lets Toni use his turn at the phone where she calls Dan at the hospital to tell them where they are and to bail them out. Dan then calls Bunky (Carol Levy), Lyla's real babysitter, to go over to his house to make sure that Lyla is okay. Bunky arrives at Dan's house and after looking around, finds Lyla asleep on her bed. Bunky then calls her boyfriend, Billy, and invites him to come on over.Billy arrives a short while later and Bunky invites him up to the master bedroom so they can have sex. While making out on the bed, Bunky hears a noise coming from the closet and asks Billy to check it out. He is pulled under the bed and the bowie knife is jabbed through the bed several times at Bunky who is able to dodge it. Bunky jumps off the bed and runs to the bedroom door. Just when Preacher comes out from under the bed, Bunky runs out of the bedroom only to be grabbed by Ronald who strangles her to death.Later, Dan arrives home with Nell, Toni and Tom when they see cops all over the house. Lyla is fine as she told them about Ronald who was there, but the police apparently do not know about the murdered Bunky and Billy. Tom asks to stay for dinner and Dan also invites Detective Barnett to stay as well in case any more of Dan's escaped patients pay a visit.That evening, Dr. Bain is trying to get a hold of Dan on the phone, but he is getting no response. At nightfall, the Potter family is having dinner when Detective Barnett goes outside after hearing a noise. As the family and Tom watch from a window, a crossbow is fired and Barnett is hit and pinned to a tree. The group reacts quickly and begins making sure all the doors and windows of the house are locked, but they also learn that the phone is dead. Toni is too scared to go upstairs alone for she tells Dan that she once had a breakdown and spent time in a mental hospital as well. Tom goes upstairs instead and secures all the windows. When Dan looks back outside, he sees that Barnett's body is gone.After an arrow is shot through a window, Tom and Dan barricade the front door with furniture as well as some of the windows as another few arrows are shot through the windows as well.Meanwhile, Bain is told by the telephone operator that the phone line to the Potter residence is out of order. He sets out to the Potter residence. At the house, the group hears a car approaching and it is Bain who gets out and tells them that their phones are out of order. Dan and the others yell at Bain to get back in his car and drive away. After Dan yells at Bain that the voyagers are there, Bain decides that it would be best to try to talk with them and calls them out. Preacher comes out of hiding from the nearby bushes and Bain (who is just as insane as all of the other psychos) tries to talk with him to come back to the hospital. Preacher angrily responds by slashing off Bain's left year with his Bowie knife and then tries to get inside the front door when Dan opens it to try to help. Bain runs back to his car and Preacher turns back towards him and runs over beside the vehicle and yells ""Romans 12.19: Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!"" Preacher pulls out his axe and swings it. A minute later, Tom looks out of a window and no one is inside Bain's car.Dan tries to scream to the men outside and tells them that he did not murder Dr. Merton, but he gets no reply. Suddenly, Barnett's dead body is thrown by Ronald through a window, and the group stacks furniture against it as Hawkes shoots another arrow through the broken window. Toni think she sees another window open and when she goes to close it, a bloody body jumps through the window at her. But she only imagined it. When Dan asks her what is wrong, Toni says ""I'm getting sick again.""Minutes later, when the group smells smoke, Dan realizes that Preacher must have broken into the basement and is planning to set fire to the house. When Nell goes to look for the fire extinguisher, she finds the dead Bunky and Billy in a closet. Dan runs down to the basement, and struggles with Preacher and knocks him out with the fire extinguisher, and puts out the fire. Upstairs, Ronald bursts into the house from the kitchen back door and runs for the group with his baseball bat. Lyla ducks under a table and cuts his leg with a knife, and Tom swings a large cleaver into his back. Tom then picks up Ronald's baseball bat and beats the cleaver in further, and Ronald falls over dead.Dan decides to make run for it and he runs outside to get to Bain's car to try to hotwire it to drive away and get help. Inside, Tom embraces a shaken Toni.... and blood begins to pour from his nose. Nell sees this and immediately realizes who Tom really is. Tom/Skagg wraps his hands around Toni's neck and begins to strangle her. Dan runs back inside when he hears the screaming and grabs Tom away from his sister. Lyla hands her mother the knife and Nell uses to stab Tom in the stomach, killing him. Suddenly, Preacher comes out of the basement and Dan struggles with him. Dan manages to twist the large bowie knife out of Preacher's hand, and stabs him the chest with it and throws the fatally wounded Preacher back into the basement. As Dan, Nell, Lyla and Toni gather together for comfort, Hawkes appears standing in the kitchen doorway with his crossbow aimed right at time. ""It's not just us crazy ones who kill"", says Hawkes. Suddenly, the electricity comes back on and Hawkes sees Dr. Merton interviewed in a news report on television. Evidently upset, Hawkes breaks the TV and leaves the house and runs off into the night.Hawkes walks through the town and passes the nightclub where the Sick Fucks are playing. He enters the club and beats up the doorman outside who insults him. In the club, Hawkes watches the punk rock band perform, when a girl whacked out on drugs walks up to Hawkes and says something to him. He pulls out his .45 caliber gun and points it at her neck. She looks at it and laughs, and so does Hawkes."

Deprogramming a dog who kills Blacks is the ultimate challenge for an unorthodox African-American trainer. When a young Hollywood actress finds the injured stray, she nurses it back to health, not knowing it's a ""White Dog"" trained by a racist to attack only Blacks. Julie's appalled when the otherwise gentle, white German Shepherd breaks out, then returns from his nighttime foray dotted with human blood. Julie desperately races from trainer to trainer, advised to kill her pet, until the top Hollywood canine expert refers her to his former protégé, Keys.—David Stevens In Los Angeles, the unemployed young actress Julie Sawyer hits a white German Sheppard while driving though the hills during the night. She brings the dog to the veterinary and keeps the animal in her house on the hills. Julie takes a picture of the dog and distributes fliers with her boyfriend seeking out the owner. When a burglar and rapist breaks in her house, the dog protects Julie and she decides to keep the animal with her. But sooner she learns the white dog is an animal trained by a racist to attack black people. However Julie has become attached to the dog and tries to find a trainer for ""deprogramming"" the dog. She goes to the Noah Ark, a place where the Afro-American trainer of wild animals Keys accepts the challenge despite the difficulties of his task.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil While driving at night, aspiring actress Julie Sawyer (Kristy McNichol) accidentally runs over a white German shepherd. She takes the dog to a veterinarian and pays for its medical treatment, but is informed that the dog is unfit for adoption and will likely be put to sleep if handed over to the pound. Julie decides to keep the dog at her house until contacted by its owner. Concerned that Julie lives alone, her boyfriend, Roland Gray, encourages her to keep the animal as a guard dog. One night, a would-be rapist assaults Julie in her home. Jolted awake by the sounds of their struggle, the dog attacks the intruder, allowing Julie time to call the police.Several days later, the dog runs away, and Julie searches for it in vain, even checking the pound to see if the dog has been picked up or turned in. The following night the dog attacks and kills the driver of a street sweeper. The dog returns to Julie's house, blood streaked across its face. Julie cleans up the animal and fails to tell Roland about the state in which she found it.The following day Julie takes the dog with her to a studio lot where she is acting in a film. In the middle of a take, the dog attacks Molly, an actress playing a scene with Julie, severely harming her. Roland, now aware of the dog's violent behavior, tells Julie that this is an attack dog and orders her to have it put down before it claims another victim. Julie refuses and takes the dog to Noah's Ark, an animal training facility, where she seeks someone who can re-train the animal not to attack people. Mr. Carruthers (Burl Ives), one of the owners of the facility, informs her that there is nothing he can do.As Julie leaves the office, the dog breaks free of her grip and jumps a black handyman, but the animal is restrained before it can inflict serious injury. Carruthers heatedly tells Julie that her pet is a 'white dog,' trained by racists to assault black people. This explains the attacks on the sweeper driver and the actress, Molly, both of whom are black. Witnessing the dog's latest assault, the co-owner of Noah's Ark, a black animal trainer named Keys (Paul Winfield), takes it upon himself to recondition the German shepherd so that it no longer attacks black people. He also makes clear that the dog's condition is to be kept a secret.As he attempts to retrain the dog through a series of confrontations in a caged arena, Keys gradually reveals his history with white dogs and explains to Julie how they are created: white racists manipulate desperate black junkies into beating puppies until they learn to hate and attack black skin. Many animal trainers, Keys included, have tried to cure white dogs, but each time the dogs have proven unable to take the last step without snapping altogether and turning into indiscriminate attack dogs.One night, the dog breaks loose of its cage and escapes from the facility. The following day, while Keys searches around town, the dog chases a black pedestrian into an empty church and kills him. Keys subdues the dog after the attack, enters the church, and, with tears in his eyes, finds the man's corpse among the pews. When Keys returns to Noah's Ark and explains what happened, Julie immediately pleads for the dog to be killed before it takes the life of yet another innocent black person. Keys angrily retorts that as much as he'd like to shoot it, killing the dog would be nothing more than a short-term solution. Reconditioning is the only procedure that can prevent the creation of more white dogs in the future.After further training, the dog shows its first sign of improvement by willingly eating out of Keys' hand, an action that it initially refused to do. That night, as Keys, Julie and Carruthers hold a celebratory dinner to mark their first victory, they acknowledge that by keeping the nature of the dog hidden from the authorities, they are essentially accessories to murder. During their conversation, a police officer enters. Though they are worried that he may have found out about the dog, it turns out that he has only come to ask for directions. After he leaves, they conclude that in spite of what the authorities decree, what they are doing is right and humane.In the following weeks, the dog continues to make slight improvements until it is finally content around black people without turning to violence. Although Carruthers is confident that they are on the verge of victory, Keys reminds him that the dog is on the edge of a mental breakdown. Keys reluctantly calls Julie, telling her they can begin the ""final test"".On the way out of her house, Julie comes face-to-face with the dog's previous owner, an old man accompanied by his two granddaughters. After questioning the man and finding that he was responsible for creating the white dog, Julie refuses to return the animal and warns his granddaughters not to let him corrupt them as well.At Noah's Ark, Keys, Julie, and Carruthers stand in triangular formation in the caged arena. Keys beckons the dog in from outside, and it runs to Keys without attacking. Hearing Julie's voice, it runs to her as well, again showing no sign of violent behavior. However, upon seeing Carruthers, the dog springs and pins him to the ground. Here, Keys finally accepts that the animal's hatred cannot be defeated, only redirected to a new target, and puts the dog down with a bullet to the head. The dog breathes its last as Keys and Julie rush Carruthers away for medical help, leaving the white dog's dead body resting in the sand."

Seblon has in part become an officer to remain at arms length from his men, one of them, Querelle, with who he is secretly in love. Querelle goes to La Feria, a bar and makeshift whorehouse owned and operated by husband and wife Nono and Lysiane, one of the whores. La Feria is infamous and notorious as anyone wanting sex with Lysiane must first roll the dice with Nono, Nono winning meaning that he will get to sodomize the loser instead. At La Feria, Querelle is surprised to see his brother, Robert, who is Lysiane's current on-going sexual partner, and who did not have to go through the roll of the dice with Nono is his special position with Lysiane. That passion in Querelle extends to his brother, the two who share more than just a family resemblance. Outwardly, Querelle goes to La Feria as a place to sell opium. However, the opium may only be a pretense as Querelle is trying to discover who he is as a man. Everyone in this collective is also on a similar sense of discovery, some who may be more aware and open about their own thoughts about the lines between sex, desire and love, those who are not as open possibly feeling shame which leads to ways to deal with that shame. Including those already mentioned, this collective includes a local stone mason named Gilles who purports to desire Paulette, a young man named Roger, Paulette's brother, with who there is unspoken sexual tension with Gilles, and Mario who, at least in appearance, ""polices"" the activities at La Feria.—Huggo DirectorRainer Werner Fassbinder's final film is a deliriously stylized tale of hothouse lust and simmering violence. Set amid an expressionistic soundstage vision of a French sea port, this daring adaptation of a novel byJean Genetrecounts the tragedy of a handsome sailor (Brad Davis) as he is drawn into a vortex of sibling rivalry, murder, and explosive sexuality. Completed just before Fassbinder's sudden death at 37, QUERELLE finds the director pushing his embrace of artifice and taboo-shattering depiction of queer desire to new extremes. French sailor Querelle arrives in Brest and starts frequenting a strange whorehouse. He discovers that his brother Robert is the lover of the lady owner, Lysiane. Here, you can play dice with Nono, Lysiane's husband: if you win, you are allowed to make love with Lysiane; if you lose, you have to make love with Nono... Querelle loses on purpose.—Yepok A sailor learns to take, and give, it like a man in this surrealistic adaptation of writer and thief Jean Genet's novel Querelle de Brest by avant-garde German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. In a colorful brothel in the port of Brest, proprietor Nono is known for wagering with his customers. Win a throw of the dice, and they get to make love with his wife, Lysiane ; lose, and they must take it from behind by Nono himself. One day, Lysiane reads the tarot for her lover, Robert , and learns in the cards of his intense passion for his brother, Querelle. Querelle himself soon arrives, and the brothers enact a bizarre greeting halfway between a hug and a wrestling match. Querelle, it seems, is looking for partners in a drug deal; Robert points him in the right direction. An argument about the merits of sex between men soon leads Querelle to murder his fellow smuggler, Vic. Back at the whorehouse, Querelle loses on purpose to Nono and finds he has a taste for passive gay sex. Meanwhile, fellow sailor Gil, who looks exactly like Querelle's brother (and is played by the same actor), murders one of his compatriots after the brute publicly impugns his manhood. Wanted by the police for both his own crime and Querelle's, Gil goes on the lam. Querelle soon crashes his hideout, and an intense bond develops between the two murderers -- a friendship that will lead Querelle to the greatest love, and the greatest treachery, of his life. Director Fassbinder was in the process of editing Querelle when he died of a drug overdose in June 1982. Gunther Kaufmann, who plays Nono, was Fassbinder's ex-lover; the film is dedicated to another former lover, El Hedi Ben Salem, the news of whose suicide had just reached the director. Critically derided even by many of Fassbinder's admirers, Querelle earned a Golden Raspberry award for Worst ""Original"" Song for ""Each Man Kills the Thing He Loves,"" an Oscar Wilde poem set to music by Peer Raben and sung repeatedly by Jeanne Moreau. Moreau had previously starred in Mademoiselle, a Tony Richardson effort co-scripted by Genet. Look for Frank Ripploh, another pioneering German director, in a cameo."
Superstition,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084739/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A witch put to death in 1692 swears vengeance on her persecutors and returns to the present day to punish their descendants. A family moves into a long-condemned New England household with a big pond out back that everybody loves to swim in. Soon, however, they find that the pond was the site of the execution- by-drowning of a witch three hundred years before, and she's back to revenge herself on anybody nearby, whether they're Catholic or not.—Brian J. Wright <tyrannorabbit@hotmail.com> A pair of young people are making out in a car in a dark area next to a large empty house. The girl says she's nervous making out there because the house has an evil reputation, but the boy convinces her there's nothing to worry about. Something resembling a corpse thuds against their car and they speed off, but the scare was a joke perpetrated by two young men who are lurking in the area. One is inside the house and the other is by the road, and they call out to one another, laughing about their joke. Then something inside the house manifests itself to the boy inside; doors start closing, and a dark presence stalks him until he's hurled against the ceiling, killing him. His friend comes inside to find him and is also stalked by the presence. He tries to escape through a window, but the window slams shut on him and holds him still while something appears behind him and slashes his lower body until his body is completely cut in half. His upper body falls outside the window while his legs fall inside the house.Inspector Sturgis pays a visit to Reverend David Thompson, a new clergyman assigned to the parish who is taking over for an elderly minister named Reverend Maier. Sturgis complains about the house, which is on property owned by the church. The two boys murdered there have brought the safety concerns of the house to the forefront, as well as the small body of water on the property, known as Black Pond. Sturgis says local teens sometimes go there to skinny dip at midnight, and there have been several drownings. Thompson tells him that the property will no longer be a concern, since there is a new priest coming to the parish who will be living there with his family, Reverend George Leahy. He and Maier go to the house and meet Arlen, the animalistic caretaker of the property grounds, who lives in a small bungalow with his aging mother. The police suspect Arlen of the two murders but are unable to establish a case against him just yet. Sturgis tells his partner, Hollister, to follow Arlen, who goes off running in the direction of the pond. Hollister investigates the dock where Arlen was standing, and is suddenly pulled under the water by a blackened, clawed hand that emerges from the pond. When Hollister doesn't return, Sturgis holds Arlen and has the pond dragged. Nobody is able to turn up his body, and Thompson announces he's going to have the pond completely drained. Arlen reacts violently, breaking free from the police and running off into the woods. Maier and Thompson talk to his mother, Elvira, who tells them her son serves a secret ""mistress"", something the two men write off as fantasy. Back at the house, Thompson meets a friendly young girl named Mary who seems to appear out of nowhere and vanishes just the same way. Before the ministers can bless the house, a freak accident occurs when the blade of a table saw being used suddenly flies off the machine and embeds itself into Rev. Maier, maintaining its rotation until it has sawed completely through his body.The Leahys move into the house anyway: Reverend George along with this wife, Melinda, and their three children: teenage girls Ann and Sheryl, and preteen Justin. They are apparently undeterred by the fact that so many people have died in the last week in their new home...not to mention the fact that the last tenants of the house, back in the 1950s, were found murdered in one way or another. On the day of their move-in, one of the renovators is killed by the black-clawed figure when he goes off into the basement alone to turn off the power in the house's old elevator. His disappearance goes unnoticed by the rest of the crew, and they leave without him. Justin Leahy, the youngest of Reverend Leahy's three children, hears the commotion in the basement and investigates, when suddenly the little girl Mary appears and introduces herself. She runs off before Justin can find out who she is. Justin excitedly tells the others that they have their own ""pool""...the pond. They all go down to the pond to relax, where Ann jumps in to swim, but she suddenly starts screaming. When they drag her out of the pond, she has a severed human hand clamped around her ankle, presumably that of Detective Hollister. As Ann lays in her bed, languishing from shock, Melinda tells George they simply can't move out of the house.Sturgis still thinks Arlen is responsible for the murders, but Elvira insists that Arlen is just protecting his ""mistress"", cleaning up her 'leavings' and guarding them against her. She is dismissed as insane. Meanwhile, after Justin finds George drinking alcohol in the basement of the house, he returns there on his own and is killed by the witch when he discovers the body she left in the elevator shaft. A search is mounted for him, but Sturgis tells the rest of the Leahy family to stay out of it and leave it to him and his men, along with Thompson. Ann has a nightmare of the family being slaughtered. When she later tries to comfort the worrying Melinda, Sheryl gets sassy and mocks their father, whom she considers to be weak and ineffectual due to his alcoholism. Ann slaps her and says ""Shut your bitchy mouth!""Thompson leaves to researches the folklore that Elvira has told them about Arlen's 'mistress', but before he leaves, Elvira tells him that the antique crucifix he has recovered from the pond was keeping the witch dormant until nightfall. Now that the cross has been removed, she can move about in the early hours of the morning. Thompson remains unconvinced, and is fixated on finding Arlen. Later, Thompson discovers a book in the church archives documenting events of the Inquisition. It seems a woman was executed for being a witch in that location in 1692, and a flashback sequence depicts it. Elondra Sharack is accused of witchcraft by a nine year old girl named Mary (the same one that's been appearing to people in present times). It seems Mary is correct, as Elondra is shackled on a plank and constantly affirms Satan as her master and insists she will take revenge on the pious-looking Reverend Pike, who condemns her to death by drowning. When the villagers execute Elondra, her voice deepens into a demonic howl and her face morphs in a bizarre fashion. The moment they drown her, the church erupts in flames and her laughter is heard everywhere. The flashback establishes that Elondra continued to haunt the area after her death, resulting in numerous deaths and disappearances. Left alone is Reverend Pike, whom she murders by crushing him in a wine press.Sturgis and his men discover a secret room off the house's basement, where Arlen has been hiding. They also find the body of the elevator repairman. The police take Arlen away in a squad car, while Sturgis stays behind to investigate the secret room, where he is killed by the witch. Melinda gets restless with waiting for some news about Justin, and she ventures downstairs. The witch emerges from the basement, trapping Melinda in the kitchen and hurling her around the room until she is bloodied and beaten. The girls are terrified by her screams and George attempts to intervene. Thompson returns, armed with the knowledge of the witch and still carrying the crucifix, which seems to undo her evil magic momentarily by allowing him to enter the supernaturally locked doors of the house. They are able to enter the kitchen, but Melinda is nowhere to be found. Thompson tells George to go back upstairs, where he barricades himself in his bedroom and discovers Melinda's dead body in their bed. The witch appears in his window and causes his death when a mirror explodes and slashes his face and throat. Thompson tries to save him but is too late.He attempts to get the girls out of the house but Sheryl runs off on her own into the attic, where the witch attacks her and gruesomely murders her by nailing her head to the floor with a large spike. Thompson sends Ann running from the house and gives her the keys to his van, telling her to save herself. When he goes into the attic to rescue Sheryl, he finds her body and is attacked by the witch. The crucifix keeps her from touching him, and before she can kill him, she vanishes. Thompson goes outside and realizes the van is still there, and he discovers Ann's dead body in the van. Despondent, he takes cans of gasoline down to the pond and purifies it with fire. Mary appears to him and reveals herself to be simply another form of the witch; Thompson drives the crucifix through her heart and she falls backwards into the pond, shrieking ""I cannot die! You cannot kill me!"" The disturbance seems over, but before Thompson can leave, Elondra's hand erupts from the pond and pulls him to his death under the water."

The Plague Dogs,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084509/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two dogs escape from a laboratory and are hunted as possible carriers of the bubonic plague. An animated adaptation of Richard Adams' novel, about a pair of dogs (Snitter and Rowf) who escape from a research laboratory and try to survive in the wild with the help of a cunning fox (The Tod). The lab director tries to keep the escape quiet, but as an increasing number of sheep are found killed, word leaks out, together with rumors that the dogs might be plague carriers.—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> A black dog (Christopher Benjamin) almost drowns, but at the last second he is rescued at some sort of scientific laboratory. The scenery outside that facility is grim and desolate. Dogs are kept onto cages, and when one of them dies, they are shoved aside with pales. Tyson (Warren Mitchell) is a hand workers who treats animals roughly. He throws Rowf to one side of the cage and some food carelessly on the other. Cage 732, the cage of the almost-drowned dog is left open by the careless feeder. The black dog is very weak, but another dog howls like a wolf and that makes Rowf mad. Snitter (John Hurt) sneaks into Rowlfs's cage. Rowf eats his food and he leaves with Snitter, who wears a kind of green cap.The laboratory is a scary place, even for a human. They have monkeys, rabbits, mice... imprisoned, unable to move. Regardless of what they are trying to research, it looks that Dr. W. Goodner likes torturing animals. A monkey makes noise, scaring the escaping dogs; they throw a glass mouse cage, and the mice immediately run away. They soon find a lock door, but they manage to get into the incinerator, which they consider a death place. Snitter is the first to jump, and Rowf feels that he has not other option than to go behind him. There is only ash and bones there. They rest and sleep there for a while. Snitter dreams of an owner in the city; that person died to push him out of a lorry's way. A female voice accuses Snitter of having killed the person. Snitter wakes up startled and he has trouble waking Rowf up. He can feel that fresh air comes from another opening, so they go through that hole on the wall when the doctor throws a dead dog to the incinerator and is about to turn it on. Suspense because Rowf has got stuck, but he and Snitter escape in the last second. They are free now.They stare at the stars. Snitter stares at the burnt black dead landscape, and wonders how the men destroyed the city and all the masters. He still thinks that there have to be masters somewhere, although Rowf doubts it. Rowf is hungry, but Snitter still thinks about the landscape and the stillness of the night.They reach a village. Snitter wants to be adopted, but Rowlf splashes the rubbish bin contents all over the place, so the man throws a stone at him. Snitter tells him that they have to behave properly if they want to get anything from masters. Their mouths water at the sight of a supermarket, but they see a butcher sharpening a knife, and they run away. Snitter tries to attack the white lines of a road. The driver of the car who has just run over Snitter stops to pick him up, but Rowf prevents it. Snitter thought they were beloved masters, but Rowl tells him that their green coats showed that they wanted to put Snitter back onto the prison/laboratory.Dr. Boycott (Nigel Hawthorne) and a laboratory assistant (Brian Stirner) think that the two dogs which are constantly running after the village sheep must be the dogs which escaped from the lab. Snitter sees a ""master"", a shepherd who uses sheep dogs; Snitter thinks that this master will take care of them pretty soon. They try to behave like the sheep dogs, but they become trampled by the flock of sheep and the sheep dogs () accuse them of spoiling their good work, as they make all the sheep run away. Snitter wants to prove humans that he can be a good dog, after all, he didn't kill his master on purpose. Rowf and Snitter wander around the land. Rowf is more aggressive, although the terrified Snitter confuses some molds with threatening bear-like silhouettes.October 18 - Day 4Blood spilling over the rocks and into a river: the two friends killed a sheep. Rowlf got quite a beating anyway, and he wants to give up. Snitter tells him that he can't stay there in the open. Snitter travels on his own until he finds an abandoned mine. Snitter has faith that, in that secret place, they will be safe and nobody will be able to find them, although Rowf tells him that there's no hope in that god-forsaken place. So the two dogs start killing sheep; there is a stream nearby where they can drink to their content. Rowf can feel that humans are a danger to them still. Rowf is a good hunter.Once, they see a fox who tells them that they have no chance without him. Snitter thinks that The Tod (James Bolam) can help them survive, but Rowf looks at him suspiciously, as he can be a vulgar thief.

The Pekignese gets away running after some wild birds. The owner, Lynn Driver (Penelope Lee) hears that the dog which had suffered a brain operation is thought to be dead - he was experimented upon in a mind-confusing surgery, and that's why Snitter seems to be unable to distinguish the real world from his dreams. Lynn and his companion, her cameraman and editor (Bill Maynard) think that it's a pity that now, they will never know if the surgery was successful. They drive into the Coniston Animal Research (Scientific & Experimental) facility carelessly.A hunter arrives at the derelict house the three friends have been sleeping in, but they are not there. At Coniston, they are more worried about their reputation than anything else. The villagers create a state of panic as Lynn Driver speaks about the news. Snitter is constantly scratching his head - he is dreaming about an island; Rowf licks the wound, but Tod doesn't believe that. Tod insists that they have to stay ahead of humans all the time. They try to kill a deer and its offspring; Tod mocks them when the deer wins the fight with his antlers.Tod catches a fish and a frog: For Rowf and Snitter, that is something much more difficult.November 21 - Day 38They approach a home with lighted windows in the night. Tod has drunk all the milk, and Rowf is angry, because they are really hungry. They are so desperate, that Rowf decides to enter the home to eat, although Snitter thinks that this is a bad idea. They take away a hen. The farmer's wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) convinces her husband not to shoot the dogs, in case they pass the bubonic plague onto them. The farmer pushes the body of the dead hen onto Rowf's mouths.It's increasingly cold - snow is everywhere now. The dogs are bony and hungry all the time.November 23 - Day 40Now, it looks that they are in the North Pole, although they are supposed to be still in the Lake District. They sleep rough, covered by the remains of a wall.On the radio, Jeffrey Westook retells how he was attacked by the dogs -- or rather his car. Lynn Driver keeps on reporting from the Lake District. A farmer sees his own sheep dog talking to the two dogs. The sheep dog says that humans are afraid of the sickness within the two dogs.A hunter keeps after the two friends, and The Tod keeps after the hunter. The dogs are more and more tired. The hunter prepares to shoot the two exhausted dogs - a vulture has begun to fly in circles above them. The Tod distracts the hunter, so that he falls from a hill - his shot only succeeds in breaking Rowf's green collar. Now, the army and the police use even helicopters to follow the tracks of the animals: they find the eaten dead body of the hunter.They walk alongside a stream. Rowf says that he owes his life to the Tod.Dr Boycott can't deny that the green collar is one of theirs. The Major (Patrick Stewart) wants him to accept what happened. He says that the researchers didn't want to admit that the dogs may have infected with the bubonic plague; now, they are trying to kill all animals. The Minister of Defense sends two companies to catch the dogs.Rowf gets clumsy because of the weakness. Sheep keep on munching and chewing. They use dogs, helicopters, lorries, shotguns... The Tod thinks that if they manage to cross the valley unseen, they will be free forever... but it may be too late for Rowf and Snitter, they are so weak. The Tod opens the way and comes back for them. They have no other option than try to run for it. A helicopter sees them but loses them from sight soon.The dogs enter a train which has stopped for maintenance while the Tod lures the hunting dogs away. However, he gets hurt. When the train starts to move, Snitter and Rowf prefer to think that the Tod has managed to run away somehow, although we can see that he was killed.The train arrives at Ravenglass. They, the dogs can smell the sea. A helicopter spots them outside a tea bar. They run like crazy until they reach the shore. They stare at the beach, the sand, and they sit to rest for a while. Meanwhile, at the facility, the monkey keeps on hearing human voices.Snitter starts swimming towards the island of his dreams. Rowf hesitates, but the approaching soldiers push him to swim.Shots are heard. There is a thick fog which hides the helicopter and the two dogs.Rowf and Snitter swim and swim; they keep going and going within the thick fog. Snitter looks to be the more exhausted, and it's Rowf who encourages him saying ""Stay with me"", deep into the thick fog.CAPTION: Martin Rosen's production of  The Plague Dogs  and end credits.

"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains",1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082639/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The media and disaffected teens mistake the acerbic rants of an obnoxious teenage punk rocker as a rallying cry for the women of America, launching her and her talentless group to national stardom. Corrine Burns retreats far into plans for her band, The Fabulous Stains, after her mother's death. So far that she gets them (she and two cousins) on a tour with a washed-out glam-rock group and a rising British punk band, radically changes her appearance, attracts a cult following and national media attention. With luck like this, what could go wrong?—Renee Ann Byrd <byrdie@wyrdbyrd.org> The Stains are a girl rock band comprised of sisters Corinne and Tracy Burns and their cousin Jessica McNeil. Their talent is questionable but media attention on Corinne's personal life gets them at least a start as a support band on a U.S. national tour. The tour headlines an aging metal band - the Metal Corpses - and their lead-in act, the British rock band, the Looters. The Stains, purely there as a buffer between the existing two feuding acts, quickly take the rock world by storm with further media attention centered on a few forthright statements from Corinne and her transformation into punk rock diva, what her fans call it ""the skunk look"". The dynamics on the tour quickly changes as the Stains' collective stars rise. The question is, will the stars burn out?—Huggo Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains chronicles the surprisingly rapid rise to stardom for a very novice aspiring ""rock"" group made up of three teenage girls who can barely play instruments and in fact, have no drummer.Catching what is probably a rare rock concert in a small, working class town in Pennsylvania (although the movie was filmed in Vancouver), the girls, especially Corrine are taken by the dashing and exotic opening act, a British punk/new wave act called The Looters (who are in fact The Professionals, the band formed by Steve Jones and Paul Cook after the breakup of the Sexpistols although the lineup was altered for the film to showcase the more photogenic Ray Winstone as the singer and Paul Simonon, the bass player for The Clash).Corrine astutely observes that The Looters are not getting along at all with the headlining act, an aging glam group trying to cash in on the success of heavy metal by posing as its de facto parents, called Metal Corpses. Corrine quickly assesses her situation: she has just lost her mother to cancer and is going to be raised by an indifferent and small-minded aunt, she is going to grow up in a small, working class town with few prospects for anyone let alone an angry and creative young woman, and if there was ever a chance for her to chase the dream of instant celebrity, this is it. She cons The Looters with her womanly charms into believing that her ""band"" is a viable third act for the tour who will perform for little or no compensation.After some brief protest by her erstwhile band mates, they embark on a nationwide tour, lack of talent or actual songs be damned. Typical rock tour trials and tribulations ensue as expected, Corrine, an angry and sassy, but naive teenager pursues a romantic relationship with The Looters singer and in the process, she realizes that she can use her gender and sexuality as tools to manipulate men and get what she wants. The question rises as to whom is taking advantage of whom. After picking up some rock n roll tips from Ray Winstone, Corrine uses these and the connections he has with promoters and agents to finagle more exposure and fame for her band. She goes a step further and steals some songs written by The Looters and begins performing them as her own at concerts where she has managed to convince local media entities to attend. She uses the recent tragedies in her life to garner support in her TV interviews and over night, with the help of a shady rock agent, amasses a following of teenage girls who attempt to emulate her new look which is also being marketed by the same shady rock agent. This, of course, infuriates Ray Winstone, who believed he was helping out and at the same time, taking advantage of a naive teenager who it turns out, played him for the sucker.Corrine soon finds out that success and fame can be fleeting, especially when they are gained more through scandal and infamy than actual talent. It is perhaps in this sense, a cautionary tale for the nonstop wave of ""celebutards"" and reality show ""stars"" that would arrive on the scene some twenty-five years after this film was made. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains maintains a loyal cult following due to the presence of actual punk royalty(The Professionals, who were an infamous and short-lived band with few appearances) and the springboard that it became for Ray Winstone, Diane Lane, and Laura Dern."

The Draughtsman's Contract,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083851/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young artist is commissioned by the wife of a wealthy landowner to make a series of drawings of the estate while her husband is away. Mr. Neville, a cocksure young artist, is contracted by Mrs. Herbert, the wife of a wealthy landowner, to produce a set of twelve drawings of her husband's estate, a contract which extends much further than either the purse or the sketchpad. The sketches themselves prove of an even greater significance than supposed upon the discovery of the body of Mr. Herbert.—Paul Kevin Harm <pkharm@papyrus-inc.com> England, 1694. Mrs Herbert (Janet Suzman) and her daughter Mrs Talmann (Anne-Louise Lambert) try to persuade Mr Neville (Anthony Higgins), an artist, to make a series of drawings of Mr and Mrs Herbert's house and estate. Mr Neville finally agrees when Mrs Herbert offers, in addition to paying for each drawing and giving him room and board while he draws, to sleep with him. (Oddly, she makes this offer in the presence of her husband's agent, Mr Noyes (Neil Cunningham), who is drawing up the contract.) Mrs Herbert intends the drawings to be a gift to her obnoxious and estranged husband, who dotes on his property and who is conveniently planning to be away from home while the drawings are created.Mr Neville inconveniences the entire household with detailed and stringent requirements for his 12 drawings. For specified periods every day, the views he has chosen must be kept clear of carriages, animals, smoking chimneys, and people -- except for the one that requires Mr Talmann (Hugh Fraser) to stand still and wear the same clothes for several days running.The atmosphere of the film is chilly; there's little indication that any of the characters like one another, and many of them are fairly hostile. Starting over the issue of Mr Talmann's wardrobe, Mr Talmann and Mr Neville snipe at one another continuously. Mr and Mrs Talmann have a bitter confrontation. It's hard to tell what the exaggerated costumes are meant to contribute: comically tall headpieces for the women, and for the men, very long, curly wigs -- waist-length, in some cases -- which, along with full-skirted coats, make them look like Edwardian schoolgirls.Mrs Herbert is distressed by the sexual part of her agreement and tries to break the contract; Mr Neville refuses. Mrs Talmann makes her own bargain for sexual favors with Mr Neville (which doesn't affect her mother's). Later, we learn that Mr Talmann is impotent -- and also that Mr Herbert doesn't believe that women should own property, so the inheritance of the estate depends on Mrs Talmann producing a son.Mr Herbert's injured horse turns up, and shortly thereafter his body is found in the moat. Mr Noyes, the agent, who as a young man wanted to marry Mrs Herbert, comes to her demanding assistance because he believes he will be suspected of murdering Mr Herbert. Mrs Herbert shows no interest in helping him, so Mr Noyes blackmails her: if she doesn't give him the drawings (why does he want the drawings?), he'll make the draughtsman's contract public, exposing her as an adulteress.Mrs Talmann observes that many of the drawings include objects that have no business being where they are: a ladder leading to Mrs Talmann's bedroom window; a pair of boots belonging to her husband; and several items of clothing belonging to Mr Herbert. Mrs Talmann implies that Mr Neville is planting clues related to the demise of Mr Herbert. But Mr Neville is clearly drawing what he sees, and we have no evidence that he's responsible for the presence of any of the misplaced objects.An odd feature of the landscape is a moving statue (Michael Feast), which turns up twined with vines against a wall, on the roof while Mrs Herbert and her guests are eating an outdoor meal in the foreground, and on a pedestal from which it first removes an obelisk.Having completed his contract and gone away, Mr Neville comes back for a visit. Mrs Herbert offers him one more tryst in exchange for one more drawing, and he agrees. He completes a view of an equestrian statue in the garden, though he draws the horse without its rider. It's not apparent whether this is because he can't see the rider -- the moving statue may not be visible to everyone -- or because Mr Neville is alluding to the death of Mr Herbert.Although his drawing is done, Mr Neville continues to sit by the statue. As it grows dark, he's surrounded by a group of masked gentlemen, most of whom are recognizable as members of the Herbert household or their friends. The gentlemen taunt Neville, put his eyes out with a torch, kill him, and throw his body in the moat. If their motivation is related to Mr Herbert's murder, they don't mention it. They burn all the drawings."

Vigilante,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084867/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After his wife and son got brutalized by a street gang, and a corrupt criminal justice system puts the perpetrators back on the street, a NYC factory worker teams up with a vigilante group to find some measure of bloody justice. Eddie Marino is a factory worker in New York City. He has a wife named Vickie and a son named Scott. Eddie's friend and co-worker Nick and some of the factory's other workers have formed a vigilante group because Nick and the group are fed up with the pimps, gangs, and drug dealers who keep taking over the neighborhoods. Nick and his group are also sick and tired of the police, because the police always fail to protect people who become victims. Eddie goes home from work one night, only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed, and Scott has been shot dead. Frederico ""Rico"" Melendez, the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang, is arrested for Vickie's stabbing and Scott's murder. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher plans to put Rico away for as long as possible, since New York doesn't have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick makes it clear that he has no faith whatsoever in the police and the judicial system. The case against Rico doesn't make it past the arraignment. Corrupt Judge Sinclair sets Rico free with a two year suspended sentence. Eddie goes crazy and tries to strangle Judge Sinclair, who sentences Eddie to spend 30 days in jail for that. It was Rico's right hand man, Prago, who had fired the shot that killed Scott while Rico stabbed Vickie. Prago also paid Judge Sinclair to set Rico free. In jail, Eddie befriends an inmate named Rake. As soon as Eddie is released from jail, he changes his mind about Nick's vigilante group. Eddie joins the group so he can go after Rico, Prago and Judge Sinclair.—Todd Baldridge When his wife is attacked and son killed by gang members, a New York factory worker joins a secret, outside-the-law, vigilante group made up of ex-cops whom target and kill criminals whom repeatedly get away with murder through legal courtroom technicalities.—Anonymous Nick is leading a group of factory workers to clean up the streets by brutally beating or killing criminals. Eddie doesn't really approve of this behavior until a gang's actions affect him personally. Eddie is then on a personal mission to end the gang's actions...permanently.—Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca> In Queens, New York, a young woman (Donna Patti) is raped and murdered in her apartment building. Rubin (Vincent Russo), the attacker, is seen by an elderly woman, but she declines to inform the police. Instead, she notifies a vigilante team comprised of local residents Nick (Fred Williamson), Ramon (Joseph Carberry), and Burke (Richard Bright). They find Rubin on a street corner, bragging to friends about how he evaded prosecution for his crime, and drag him to their van and drive away.The next day, housewife Vickie Marino (Rutanya Alda) comes to the defense of a gas station attendant who is being bullied by Frederico 'Rico' Melendez (Willie Colon), leader of a the Headhunters street gang. When she returns home with her toddler son, Scott, she notices Rico and several gang members parked outside, and calls police for help. Within seconds, the gang enters and assaults her. Scott hides in the bathtub, but gang member Prago (Don Blakely) kills him with a shotgun. Vickie runs to the backyard, screaming for help, and is brutally beaten by Rico.Meanwhile, her factory wielder husband, Eddie (Robert Foster), lunches at a saloon with co-workers Nick, Ramon, and Burke. Patrolman Gibbons (Steve W. James) enters and informs the group that Rubin was found dead in a vacant lot with every bone in his body broken. Nick takes no credit for the murder, but reminds the officer that his neighbors need protection that police and the courts no longer provide.Later, as Eddie leaves work, he asks about the exchange with Patrolman Gibbons. Burke recalls his frustrating career as a police officer, and recommends vigilantism as a more effective form of law enforcement. Eddie returns home to find his house surrounded by police cars. Detective Russo (Randy Jurgensen) assures Eddie that police know the identity of the guilty parties and advises him to file a complaint with District Attorney Mary Fletcher (Carol Lynley). Eddie meets with Fletcher, who informs him that Rico has been arrested.Afterward, Nick recounts a similar tragedy that befell his family, and advises Eddie to carry a gun, rather than allow himself to be victimized. Eddie disagrees, believing an escalation of violence can only lead to anarchy. He attends Rico's arraignment, as does Prago, who pays defense attorney Eisenberg (Joe Spinell) a large amount of cash to assure Rico's freedom. Eisenberg motions to drop the murder charge against the child Scotty, in return for a guilty plea for the assault on Vickie. Mary Fletcher agrees, but demands a 15-year sentence. Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) notes that Rico has no prior convictions, despite his 22 arrests, and offers a two-year suspended sentence. Eddie is unable to contain his outrage and violently assaults Rico in open court. Judge Sinclair sentences Eddie to 30 days in prison for contempt of court.With Eddie in prison, Nick and his group try to track down the source of drugs that have been sweeping their neighborhood. Nick chases after a small-time drug dealer named Blueboy (Frank Pesce) in a long foot-chase sequence whom they rough up and make him talk by hanging him by his ankles outside a building. Blueboy caves in and points them to his supplier: a local pimp named Horace (Bo Rucker).That evening, Nick and the group follow and confront Horace the pimp after they watch him beating up one of his prostitutes for not making enough money for his daily cocaine habit. After a short chase through the streets, they force Horace off the road where they torture him to reveal his drug source. Horace tells Nick that a high profile businessman, named Mr. T, is his suppler. After killing Horace, Nick, Ramon, and Burke trace the illegal narcotics trade in their community to Thomas 'Mr. T' Stokes (Peter Savage), a prominent businessman with known connections to organized crime. They ambush and kill him outside his office the following night.Meanwhile, at the prison, Eddie is attacked in the shower by prison bully, Leon (Kim Delgado), and his sycophant, Felix (Burt Pittari) and nearly sodomized, before an older inmate named Rake (Woody Strode) comes to Eddie's defense and subdues both of them.Upon Eddie's release, he joins the vigilantes. They burst into Rico's apartment that same evening as he makes love to his girlfriend, Rosie (Hyla Marrow), and accuse him of killing Scott. Rico insists that he did not kill Eddie's son and blames the murder on Prago, but Eddie shoots Rico to death anyway. But then, Rosie attempts to kill them, and after wounding Burke, gets shot dead by Nick. As the four vigilante's leave, a member of the Headhunters witnesses the group's departure outside the building and informs Prago. As the police investigate the crime scene, Detective Russo advises Patrolman Gibbons not to discuss the killings, believing the media will portray the vigilantes as heroes.Prago takes over as leader of the Headhunters and mistakenly assumes that dirty cops killed Rico. The following night, Prago and the gang ambush a police car and kill both cops, including Patrolman Gibbons, in a hail of bullets.The next day, Vickie is released from the hospital, but refuses to return home, as the trauma left her with no feelings for her husband. Another day or two later, Nick pays a visit to Eddie, who then expresses his intent to leave the city in hope of finding a safer place to live. Nick tries to convince him to stay and fight for his home.A little later, as Eddie is driving through Brooklyn on his way out of town in his van, he spots Prago on the street and recognizes him from the courtroom that day of him being around Rico. Eddie parks his van and follows Prago on foot who soon spots Eddie and attempts to shoot him while Eddie returns fire. A climatic chase sequence begins where Prago hijacks a car and attempts to drive away while Eddie steals another car and chases after him through the streets, evading other cars and pedestrians alike. A police car briefly gives chase, but Eddie manages to knock the patrol car aside and off the road. The chase leads to a local dockyard mill on the East River where both cars crash and Eddie chases Prago on foot again up a storage tower where he confronts him with being the person who killed his young son. Sadistic and insane to the last, Prago admits to killing Eddie's son and then dares Eddie to kill him... who responds by throwing Prago off the tower to his death without hesitating.In the final scene, Eddie targets the last of his enemies: the corrupt Judge Sinclair who sentenced him to jail by planting a bomb under the judge's car in the Brooklyn courthouse parking lot. That night, when Judge Sinclair gets in his car and starts the engine, it explodes, killing the judge. Watching from a distance in his van, the satisfied Eddie drives away into the night."

The Man Who Saved the World,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182060/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two space cadets crash-land on a desert planet, where an evil wizard seeks the ultimate power to take over the world. Although the movie borrows some background footage from Star Wars, the plot is mostly unrelated. The film follows the adventures of Murat (Cüneyt Arkin) and Ali (Akkaya, Aytekin), whose spaceship crashes on a desert planet following a battle (shown by using footage from Star Wars as well as Soviet and American space program newsreel clips). While hiking across the desert, they speculate that the planet is inhabited only by women. Ali does his wolf whistle, which he uses on attractive women. However, he blows the wrong whistle and they are attacked by skeletons on horseback, which they defeat in hand-to-hand combat. The main villain soon shows up and captures the heroes, bringing them to his gladiatorial arena so they can fight.The villain tells them he is actually from Earth and is a 1,000-year-old wizard. He tried to defeat Earth, but was always repelled by a ""shield of concentrated human brain molecules"" (which looks like the Death Star from Star Wars). The only way he can bypass this impenetrable defense is to use a human brain against it. The heroes escape and hide in a cave full of refugees who already fled the villain's tyrannical rule.Murat develops a romantic connection with the only woman there (Füsün Uçar), who looks after the children. (The implied romance is shown through many long eye-contacts and smiles from the young woman, but nothing more.) Zombies of the dark lord attack the cave and turn several of the children into zombies, their blood used to renew the evil wizard's immortality. The three then flee the cave and find a local bar, lifted directly from Star Wars (the Mos Eisley Cantina). The two men quickly get into a bar brawl, but the villain suddenly appears and captures them again.The wizard separates the men and tries to convince them to join him. He sends his queen to seduce Ali, while he orders Murat to be brought before him. He offers Murat the chance to rule over the earth and stars if he joins him. He possesses the power of Earth's ancestry in the form of a golden brain, and all he needs to conquer Earth is a real human brain. After Murat declines, the wizard shows that he has the woman and child in captivity. Enraged, Murat fights the wizard's monsters and skeleton guardians.Meanwhile, monsters attack Ali when he is about to kiss the queen. He defeats the monsters and joins Murat's fight. They are both disabled by laser-armed guards and then unsuccessfully tortured by the wizard. Finally, the wizard pits Murat against a giant monster in the arena. Murat defeats the monster and flees, taking the woman and the child with him. Ali is left in captivity.Murat finds out about a sword made by ""the 13th clan,"" who melted a mountain thousands of ""space years"" ago. Murat later finds this sword, shaped like a lightning bolt, in a cave defended by two golden ninjas. He takes the sword after dispatching the guards in an uncharacteristically short fight. Renewed by the sword's power, Murat goes to free his friend from the sorcerer's dungeon. However, Ali becomes envious of the sword, knocks out Murat and takes both the sword and the golden brain. The wizard then uses trickery and deceit to make Ali hand over the artifacts. Having touched these items, the wizard now has increased powers and traps Murat, Ali, the woman and the child. Ali is killed in a foolish attempt to escape.Grief-stricken, Murat decides to melt down the golden sword and the golden human brain and forge them into a pair of gauntlets and boots. Equipped with magical gloves and super-jumping boots, he searches for the sorcerer to avenge his friend's death. After fighting numerous monsters and skeletons, he comes face-to-face with his nemesis and karate chops him in half. He then leaves the planet for Earth in a spaceship (which greatly resembles the Millennium Falcon)."

Después, en una cafetería, toman algo, y él lee dos noticias: el científico español De la Peña que logró reproducir seis periquitos asexualmente y que el emperador de Tirana ha escapado a Estados Unidos y se refugia en una isla en Contadora (Panamá). La pareja de la mesa de al lado, vestidos como iban vestidos durante la Movida, se quejan de que no tienen dinero, y esnifan a la vista de todo el mundo. Otra noticia: Patty Diphusa, una estrella de porno, es entrevistada en una revista. Los tíos entablan conversación, ya que el que está leyendo paga toda las consumiciones de la pareja antes de que el camarero (Javier Ulacia) monte un escándolo con la pareja joven por no pagar. El joven le ofrece irse a su pisito de 60 metros. Ellos se van, pero la cámara se queda con Sexilia (Cecilia Roth), que está hablando con unos tíos para montar una fiesta en su piso con drogas y sexo.En un piso, dos tías están hablando. Una de ellas, Susana Díaz (Ofelia Angélica), come un montón, es una maruja regordeta que está planchando. La joven, Sexilia, le cuenta que ayer conoció a 8 ó 9 tíos y se los llevó a su casa a follar con ella sóla. Sexi dice que nunca invita a chicas a sus fiestas, porque ella sola puede con todas, y admite, satisfecha, que es una ninfómana, ""desde niña"". Susana le dice que la culpa es de su padre, que no se preocupa de ella y por eso Sexi lo odia, intentando vengarse de él follándose a todos los tíos. Susana le dice que ella también quiere tirarse al padre (Fernando Vivanco) de Sexi, el bioginecólogo doctor de la Peña, y lo llama a su consultorio. Él aduce que está muy ocupado y la rechaza: se supone que Susana es la psicóloga de Sexilia, como le dice el padre a una mujer, Toraya (Helga Liné), antigua emperatriz de Tirana.Susana y De la Peña se conocieron en una fiesta, pero Ana (Mercedes Juste) le dice que él está obsesionado con su trabajo. Sexilia no sale de su habitación durante el día porque odia al sol. Susana dice que es una ""psicóloga a la italiana"" y se ofrece para darle un tratamiento a Sexi.La emperatriz, a la que llaman Princesa, de acento italiano, está satisfecha de ser fertil, por fin. De la Peña le pregunta por el emperado, pero ella le dice que debe estar pasándolo muy mal por el cáncer, el exilio y demás circunstancias de su vida. Resulta que De la Peña lo conoció en una playa hacía 15 años. Resulta que el Emperador quería que la mitad de la nación llevase su sangre, y habla con un joven De la Peña , que acababa de publicar una artículo muy polémico sobre ginecológía y estaba veraneando en el mismo lugar. Princesa piensa que el emperador está un poco loco, y desde que la dejó a ella, todavía más.Afuera, dos pacientes hablan del tratamiento revolucionario; a una ya le ha funcionado, y lleva a la niña que nació para una revisión, mientras que la otra piensa que será feliz cuando sea finalmente madre. La madre (Eva Siva) dice que ahora no tendría a la niña Maricarmen (María del Carmen Castro), y la niña dice que la madre está de los nervios. La niña es muy maleducada, y contesta al médico. Princesa dice que Maricarmen es una niña probeta. La madre de Maricarmen no quería tener hijos, pero el tío con el que estaba sí los quería. Al final, buscaron esa solución, y en cuanto nació Maricarmen, el tío la dejó abandonada. La otra paciente (Zulema Katz) le aconseja que aproveche que es azafata para conocer a otros hombres. Sexi entra mientras Princesa sale, y la segunda comenta lo feliz que se siente ahora que ya es fertil; Sexi gruñe que para qué quiere eso. De la Peña se disculpa por la mala educación de su hija, y dice que su hija es un gran problema.Sexi dice que su psicóloga está muy loca, a lo que su padre le responde que la gente dice que es muy buena.En una tintorería, el dependiente (Luis Ciges) está tomando algo para que se le ponga dura (supongo que será algún antecedente de la Viagra). Sexi lleva un montón de ropa, y la dependienta Queti (Marta Fernández Muro) lo anota todo. Necesitarán cinco días. La dependienta se imagina con el vestido corto. Los de la lavandería son padre e hija. Resulta que la hija le pone betamuro en el té, para que se le pase el ansia sexual. El padre se acicala y Queti le pone crema en la espalda. El padre no quiere que Queti le llame papá, e intenta llevársela a la cama. El padre la ata a la cama y le dice que le encanta que tenga dos personalidades.En la revista del corazón Diez Minutos aparece Riza Niro (Imanol Arias) en portada. Es el hijo del Emperador, también exiliado. Sadec (Antonio Banderas) liga con el tío del principio en plena calle. Princesa le dice a Mohammed que ya es fertil, y que necesita conseguir semen del emperador. Se van los dos a follar. Resulta que Sadec es de Tirania, y Riza se entera porque hay una foto de él vestido como una mujer musulmana en el baño. Riza quiere irse inmediatamente al darse cuenta de que es paisano suyo, aunque él afirma se inglés pero que su madre era de Marruecos, y de repente tiene una prisa enorme. Parece que los tíos con los que Sadec está compartiendo piso son criminales que quieren secuestrar a Riza Niro, aunque el asunto va a estar complicado, porque entre otras cosas, ni Hassan (Agustín Almodóvar) ni Alí (Juan Carlos Quirós) saben dónde vive Riza Niro.Una sesión de fotos con Fabio (Fabio/Fany McNamara) como zombie salido. En esta sesión delirante, Pedro Almodóvar (Él mismo) dirige la broca que lo agujerea. Riza lo visita, porque quiere que lo cambie completamente.

Nana (Ana Trigo) protesta por el cambio en el programa, pero se consuela mientras come un plátano y le dicen que sugruo va a grabar un disco. Llega Eusebio (Ángel Alcázar) y su grupo como los sustitutos oficiales, pero él resbala, se cae por unas escaleras y su novia (Cristina Sánchez Pascual) tiene que llevarla al hospital. Encuentran un sustituto para el cantante, Riza Niro, porque se sabe la canción Gran Ganga. Resulta que ahora quieren que el sustituto firme un contrato con ellos.Sexi y Riza se miran, pero ella se va con dos tíos y él se va con otro, Santi (Javier Pérez Grueso) cada uno por su lado. Esa noche resulta que ninguno de los dos es capaz de tener relaciones sexuales satisfactorias. Sexi se cuela vestida como Caperucita Roja, y visita a Riza. Duermen juntos, y quiero decir que realmente duermen juntos, porque los dos han tenido una noche muy larga. Él dice que en un mes se vuelve a Panamá, en la isla Contadora. Sexilia se ofrece a irse con Riza adónde sea.Cuando ella se va, se encuentra a Queti andando por la calle vestida con su vestidito verde estampado. Sale corriendo del taxi para echárselo en cara. Queti dice que es fan de Sexi, que también canta en el grupo. Sexilia se ofrece al levar a Queti en taxi a su casa, y durante la conversación le pregunta por qué ella no está satisfecha con su propia vida, y ella le dice que está muy traumatizada.

Battletruck,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084887/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Post World War III futuristic tale of collapsed governments & bankrupt countries heralding a new lawless age. In the near future, after World War III, all remaining reserves of petroleum have finally run out; forcing people to ration the few remaining containers of gasoline left on the earth against mercenaries and warlord scavengers. A former goverment official named Straker (James Wainwright), leading a group of former soldiers (accompanied by his daughter Corlie) find a vast supply of diesel fuel in a compound once thought to be radioactive. Straker and his group travel in a large, heavily armored ""battle truck"" which is armed with heavy machine guns, and a howitzer. When Corlie refuses to execute the previous owners, she runs away from base camp.A foraging man known only as Hunter (Michael Beck), is traveling the desolate landscape on his amazing (possibly ex-future-military?) motorcycle, rescues the girl and takes her to his farm. After keeping her on the farm on a temporary basis, Hunter sends her off to live in a walled city (known in-film as Clearwater Farm) governed by a strict old-fashioned democracy (similar to the Quakers) where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by the mercenaries commanded by her father, Colonel Straker, who moves to attack the Clearwater using the ""battle truck"". In the chaos that ensues, Corlie manages to escape back to Hunter's remote hideout. Straker terrorizes the residents of Clearwater, taking their weapons, medicines, and other supplies and handing the women over to his men.Within a short time, one of the residents of Clearwater betrays the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator, Rusty, who knows the secret location of Hunter's hideout. Straker and company use toture to get the info from poor Rusty, then move in to attack Hunter's base and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his bike. Straker, in a minor rage, plows through Hunter's place with the truck.Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's battle truck. While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, the same no good rat who betrayed Corlie before knocks her out, puts her in a wagon and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the rat sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow. Believing that he has killed Hunter, he appears at Straker's HQ with Corlie in the wagon and very pleased with himself.Meanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact that he is wounded. He attacks Straker's HQ, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 liter diesel supply... blowing up the fuel in a spectacular explosion. He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him in the battle truck.In the climatic chase down the rural dirt roads, Straker forces the driver to overdo it in the truck, overheating the turbines. This stresses out the driver, (who loves the truck), and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter meanwhile gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's HQ was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The Clearwater people are at the high place waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a M-72 rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the movie. Hunter fires a couple of rockets at the truck, one causes slight damage and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is uselessly destroying the truck, Straker kills the driver, who slumps over the wheel and now the truck, throttles set to full, is more or less out of control.Back on the motorbike again, Hunter manages to jump onto the truck through a hole in the top that one of his rockets had made. A gun battle/slugfest ensues, the truck still careening wildly back and forth while Corlie tries to control it with the body of the driver slumped over the wheel and Straker furiously shouting commands to everybody. Eventually, Hunter fights his way to the front, temporarily stuns and maybe blinds Straker, grabs Corlie, and jumps with her from the back of the still wildly out of control battle truck (leaving his bike on the truck). Now Straker is the last one alive on the truck, still screaming threats and bumbling about in the smoking ruins of the interior. Finally, the truck, which has long since left the road and has been roaming wildly across the open desert, goes over a cliff and rolls over and over and over in a dramatic, slow-motion crash scene. The truck explodes and is well and truly destroyed, (shedding axles and other heavy bits all the way down), and part of it ends up in a lake at the bottom.Hunter and Corlie end up back at Clearwater, where Corlie apparently settles for good as part of the community. Ever the loner, Hunter rides off into the sunset on a horse, promising Corlie that he'll be back ""sometime""."

Smithereens,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084698/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A talent-challenged girl tries to promote herself to stardom in New York's waning punk music world. A restless and abrasive young woman eschews the affections of a sensitive young portrait artist, preferring to chase punk singers in a misguided desire for fame and fortune in New York's Greenwich Village.—Rick Ferncase <ferncase@chapman.edu> Originally from New Jersey, a place she vows never to return, Wren is a 19-year-old wannabe punk musician living in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. In reality, she wants to be famous, but does not really want to do anything to achieve that fame. She is a hanger-on, a parasite... latching herself to anyone she thinks can help her. Her sole modus operandi is self-promotion, as opposed to doing anything even remotely related to music in her own right. The person who she tries to latch herself onto the most is Eric, a musician who has some renown from playing in the local nightclubs. On the most part, Eric gets out of Wren what he wants, which has nothing to do with her music, and throws her away after he's done. In her self-promotion, she squanders away what little money she makes at her part-time photocopy shop job, and the result is her being behind four months in rent and threatened with eviction from her shabby apartment. She catches the eye of Paul, a young man recently arrived from Montana, who lives out of his broken-down painted Econoline van parked down by the highway where the local hookers hang out. As such, he is mobile in that he sees New York only as a temporary stop from where he can drive away. After spending some time with Wren, Paul can see she is only using him, only being with him when she has no where else to go, but he can't help but always take her back, when she does come back, which is all the time. She treats him much as Eric treats her, something she chooses not to see. Wren's actions are ratcheted up a notch when she decides her fortunes lie in Los Angeles, if only she had a way to get there..—Huggo Susan Seidelmanestablished her distinctive vision of New York City with this debut feature, the lo-fi original for her vibrant portraits of women reinventing themselves. After escaping New Jersey, the quintessentially punk Wren (Susan Berman)-a spark plug in fishnets-moves to the city with the mission of becoming famous. When not pasting up self-promotional flyers or hanging at the Peppermint Lounge, she's getting involved with Paul (Brad Rijn), the nicest guy to ever live in a van next to the highway, and Eric (Richard Hell), an aloof rocker. Shot on 16 mm film that captures the grit and glam of downtown in the 1980s, with an alternately moody and frenetic soundtrack by the Feelies and others, Smithereens-the first American independent film to compete for the Palme d'Or-is an unfaded snapshot of a bygone era. In New York City, a young 19-year-old runaway named Wren (Susan Berman), who fancies herself to be an up-and-coming rock 'n' roll star, steals sunglasses from a pedestrian at a subway station and pastes photographs of herself inside a subway train. There, Paul (Brad Rinn), a plainly-dressed newcomer to the city from Montana, is smitten by the teen girl. When Wren gives him one of her handbills, he follows her around town and approaches her that night in front of the Peppermint Lounge, a nightclub for New Wave rockers. When Wren is ignored by the showcased musicians, she allows Paul to walk her home, but rejects his request for a date.The next morning, Paul awakens in his makeshift home, a spray-painted van, and admires Wren's flyer which features the text, ""Who is this?"" On Friday night, Paul waits outside Wren's door to her apartment building and she reluctantly agrees to join him for a movie. Although Paul tries to coax her back to his van, his seduction is interrupted by a bygone rock star named Eric (Richard Hell), who jumps out of a taxicab to get away from his blonde date. Besotted by Eric, the former front man of the band ""Smithereens,"" Wren chases him to a bar and vies for his attention while Paul grudgingly plays video games. Paul begs her to leave, but she insists Eric can bolster her career. As Wren and Eric dance, Paul leaves in anger.Later that same night, Eric carries the intoxicated Wren back to his basement apartment dwelling and speaks of his plans to move to Los Angeles, California, where he will revitalize his rock and roll career. In the bathroom, Wren discovers Eric's disheveled and injured roommate, Billy (Roger Jett). Although she rejects his advances, she awakens the next morning to find herself lying between the two men, completely clothed, as Eric's sultry, blonde taxicab companion watches from across the room. Eric kisses Wren goodbye and she returns to her shared apartment to find a padlock on the door. The landlady throws her clothes out the window and pours water on her head for failure to pay the overdue rent.Now homeless, Wren seeks a loan from her older sister, Terry (Pamela Speed), who suggests the girl return to their family home in New Jersey. Terry's boorish husband, Mike (Tom Cherwin), also refuses Wren's request. Wren refuses to go home to her parents and leaves.Wren finds Paul's van in a vacant lot and begs for help. Although he tries to drive away without her, his vehicle breaks down, and she convinces him to burglarize her apartment to retrieve her remaining belongings. Back in the van, Wren finds Paul's handgun and moves into his shabby abode. However, she remains infatuated with Eric.Sometime later, Wren tries to take up residence with her copy shop co-worker, Cecile, but the girl insists her roommates despise Wren. When Cecile pleads for an introduction to the infamous Eric, the girls head to his apartment for a date, but he fails to show. Dejected, Wren returns to Paul's van and rests next to him. Paul awakens in anger and accuses Wren of being an opportunist.The following day, Wren finds Eric at a cafe, beguiling another lovesick devotee into financing his Los Angeles pilgrimage. Wren insults the woman and a fight ensues.That evening, Paul finds Wren in his van with a bloodied face. She tells him about a dream in which the world is blown to ""smithereens,"" but the deluded survivors still go about their lives in ignorance, floating on remaining shards of earth. Wren admits she is from New Jersey, where she is universally despised, and asks Paul to shoot her, but the two make love instead. Afterward, Paul announces his plan to leave for New Hampshire and invites her along.When Paul is away the following day, Wren is surprised to find Eric in the van. He claims to be out of money, with no ride to Los Angeles. Although Wren is considering the move to New Hampshire, Eric tempts her with a kiss and shares a ""dangerous"" idea.Sometime later, at a nightclub, Wren propositions a married businessman named Ed who is in New York City for a convention.

Eventually they break out and split up. A Shah, who lost his priceless Scarab ring in the original robbery, tracks it to the two remaining women and offers them an employment opportunity. Director Ted Mikels appears as Leo the Fence, who is killed by one of the women who stomps him repeatedly with her spiked heel.—John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> (00:00) Intertitle: ""In the beginning... there were ten good girls.""Four girls are outside of a Gold Mine: Sheila (Sally Alice Gamble) in a patterned shirt and baggy trousers; a tall brunette in a red shirt and white slacks; a girl in white t-shirt and yellow shorts; and further away, busy with a shovel, a Girl Miner in a blue-stripes t-shirt (Lani Silver).
Sheila warns Tom'the Atom Bomb' (Thomas J. Manning) that there are women inside, but the demolition expert - and only man at the wor site - tells her not to worry, because ""they're in the other alley"". When he detonates the explosives, three girls come out of the cave, proving that he was wrong: one girl comes out coughing, complaining of a hurt ankle; Maggie Benson (Dixie Lauren), a brunette in green t-shirt and blue jeans; and Beth (Paula Ian) a tall girl in Scottish patterned t-shirt and blue shorts, who screams that Sam is still inside. Maggie enters the dark cave quickly, while there are still rocks falling around, and comes out carrying Samantha Sommers (Sherri Vernon), a brunette in blue t-shirt and bluejeans, on her shoulders.Maggie confronts Tom and tells him, ""Pack your shit and get out of here"". Tom complains that he has been working for three weeks without pay, and decides to take his pay by attacking and ripping the striped blue shirt off of the Gold Mine Girl, exposing further her heavy, firm breasts. The eight women gang up on him, beat and kick him up [off camera].Maggie and Sam call Beth apart and suddenly suggest they start ""to live the easy way"", making a hand gesture to mean as armed robbers, instead of being gold-diggers. Beth promptly agrees smiling, and they are joined by Sheila.(04:15) Intertitle. ""A short time later, with class.""A black 1976 Lincoln Continental Mark IV arrives at The Marketplace Mall, and stops in front of the jewelry shop. Maggie, smartly dressed as a classy driver, opens the doors for two ladies, Samantha in a brimmed hat and black dress, and Beth with (a wig of) white hair in a blue dress. The two ladies enter the Brett Walker Jewelry shop. Behind the engraved glass door, the Guard (Jack Dees) and the Jeweler (Frank Walshe) welcome them. Samantha is attended by the shop's assistant Sheila in an adjoining room, and the Jeweler attends to Beth's wishes.
The ladies see several jewels, and then Beth complains about the loud argument between Liz (Christina De Cattani), a brunette with glasses and a scarf that covers all of her hair, and Carol (Sally A. Gamble), a black girl in light blue dress, in front of the shop's window. The Guard goes out, and escorts the girls away. Beth says she has decided to ""take them all"", smiling, and the Jeweler smiles back delighted until he sees a big gun pointed at him. Samantha does the same at Sheila. Both demand that all the items be placed inside their hand bags. The Jeweler complains that the pieces are very valuable, designed by him, but obeys.Maggie sees on the rear-view mirror that a black Mercedes with two Arabs is parking behind hers. She klaxons, giving a warning to Joanie (Sherry Hardin), a look-out girl in salmon shirt and a head bandanna, who steps in the way of the Sheik's Man (Michael McCloskey) who was heading to the jewelry shop. She asks what time it is, he shows her the wrist-watch, and she starts a silly talk about watches. The two other look-out girls are still arguing about an alleged car that was supposed to have been parked in front of the shop, and stalling the Guard.
Inside, the two ladies force the Jeweller into the vault, and leave the shop with the jewels, plus the Bismark collection in a briefcase, Beth keeps a gun pointed at their ""hostage"" Sheila, hidden under her black handbag, as the trio walks to the car outside. The Jewellery Guard runs at them - leaving the two girls still arguing - but his aim is just to open the door for the ladies.(09:20) Intertitle: ""The getaway""The Mark IV drives away fast. The Guard returns to the shop, and is puzzled not to find the Jeweller. The Sheik's Man returns to the car, where the Arab Sheik (Charles Gorgano) is still waiting.The Mark IV stops in a narrow alley in West Houston Street, Santa Ana [near Ben Warner's car shop and the E-Z Labor pay services], and the four women get out, and have a quick change of clothes. Apparently, the Lincoln Continental Mark IV had been stolen from Jock (Sigfried von Conanburg), whom they leave, naked, gagged and tied up, in the Mark IV's back seat [Jock's transfer from the car's boot is off camera].Jill McLean (Melodie Bell) a curly blonde, was waiting in a blue sedan with white top, and when the three look-out girls arrive in a brown sedan with white top, driven by Joanie, with Liz and, in the back seat, Carol, she gets out and and tells the women in the Mark IV to hurry up. They do: Sheila gets aboard the brown sedan by the driver, as Liz had already moved back in this three doors car, and the other three women get into the blue sedan, again feeling the inconvenience of a three-door car.Meanwhile, a Policeman (Johnny Hawk) arrives at the Jewelry Store attracted by an alarm. The Guard managed to open the vault, and the Jeweler is now free, in a rage because his collection worth $1,000,000 in gold, diamonds and sapphires, is gone. The cop tries in vain to get a description of the robbers, and it's then that the Jeweler recalls they took his assistant hostage. Between the Jeweler and the Guard, the Policeman learns that the robbers had been 3, 2, and 4.The Sheik's Man (Michael McCloskey) enters the shop, and the Jeweller tells him that the entire Bismarck collection has been robbed, though he expects the insurance company will pay, so the items can be replaced. The Sheik's Man says, ""My master's scarab can not be replaced! He will not leave one stone unturned to retake his ring! It was a sacred scarab, and it took a long time to find it, and now it's gone... It grieves me greatly that I'll have to tell him. I have to go now.""(13:00) Intertitle: ""The chase is on.""The two sedans park side by side at a small parking lot, and the eight girls get together in joy, particularly Sheila, who seems to have been drinking from a gin bottle she keeps in her hand.
Meanwhile, Achim, the Sheik's Man, is driving around with the Sheik, looking for the Lincoln Mark IV. The firsts who find the car are a teenage boy and two girls who, with the help of a wood box, manage to peer inside, curious about the naked man inside. They run away when the Sheik's car drives into the alley. Achim opens the limousine's door, exposing Jock [off camera].(14:30) Intertitle: ""Shoot-out at duck park""Later in the evening the women are all at a park of Seal Beach City. Some are drinking gin, others start arguing about what to do with the guns, and it progresses to its use at shooting people, how to practice on moving targets... Sheila asks Joanie to stand, and be a moving target for her... The girl refuses, and Sheila tells her to drink some more. Carol says that she used to shoot ducks when she was in Florida. Samantha sets a defiance for them to prove who is the best shot. ""Right! Take your guns, and line up!"" says Maggie, now in an obvious state of drunkenness. They line up in two rows back to back, holding up their guns: Sam, Sheila, Beth and Liz, against Maggie, Carol, Joanie and Jill. ""On the count of three, turn round and fire!"" intones Sam. As she counts out, ""One - two - three!"" the women step apart and turn suddenly on each others, shooting at will at their adversaries bosoms lightly covered by shirts and t-shirts. They screech, but keep ""shooting"", and laughing, as their clothes become wet and see-through, due to the water from their ""guns"".(16:00) Well past sun-set, the women arrive at Paradise... (Nevada), driving through the South Las Vegas Boulevard passing the neon signs of its casino hotels: the space-themed Vegas World; the Marina Casino Hotel, offering fine dining of lobster and prime ribs and Frederick Apcar's «A BARE TOUCH OF VEGAS» mini revue [demolished to give way to the MGM Grand]; the Circus Circus Hotel Casino; the The Dunes Hotel [operating from 1955 to 1993]; the Stardust that had on the Lido of Paris show [imploded in March 13, 2007]; the Barbary Coast [operating from 1978 to 2007] and the Flamingo Hilton. At a nondescript nightclub, the 8 girls have some food, and more booze.(16:50) Intertitle: ""The plot thickens...""The telephone rings at Leo Vieira's, better known as Leo the Fencer's (Ted V. Mikels) mansion. He's topless, wearing a large, wild boar bone in a necklace over his hairy chest, and is waxing his mustache by the swimming pool where three girls are cavorting. His assistant Vickie (Anne Gaybis) takes the call, and passes it to him - showing her annoyance about the morning caller: ""It's a broad!"" Leo wants to know how Sheila has got that number. Sheila who seems to have had a previous relationship with Leo, gives him a name, he accepts it, and she tells him she has a $1,000,000 collection for him. He quickly accepts to meet her that evening, alone and with the stuff. He sends the three broads away.
At the Riviera Hotel [operating from 1955 to 2015] the 8 girls get together in one of the suits, and dress up for the evening out.Early evening, Leo receives yet a phone call, from the Mob Man (Steve DeFrance), telling him in a menacing tone he would better pay, or else. Leo does not have the money, and the man suggests he may pay with any other ""liquid assets"" such as... jewels, thus making Sheila's visit the more important for Leo.Sheila, Samantha, Maggie and Beth are waiting for their meeting at a disco, where she is accosted by a Dude (Lyle Peskin) with an invitation from his boss, Leo Vieira. Their conversation is being watched from another table by Achim and the Sheik's Guard (Bertrand Levesque). The Dude is not pleased that Sheila is accompanied by three of her girls - but he escorts them to a car driven by Danny (James Emery); Sheila gets in and her girls follow her in the blue sedan. Unknown to all, they're followed by the two Arabs in the Mercedes.Leo shows his displeasure at the presence of four women instead of one, dismisses Danny, but calms down and inspects the jewels. Vickie brings some drinks, and her attention is immediately attracted by the shining stones. Leo tells Sheila he won't pay for the jewels, and Sam stands up and says they'll offer them somewhere else. Leo pulls a plastic bag with white powder from a drawer, and says he is offering them a trade, ""at street value, $500,000"". As the girls are reluctant to accept, he adds one, then two similar bags to the lot, making it $1,500,000. They keep their objections, and he starts menacing them with a revolver, ordering them to leave while they're healthy. Maggie pretends to sample the stuff before accepting, opens a plastic bag, shows she is pleased, and as Leo relaxes his attention, she blows part of the stuff into his eyes, and Sheila clobbers a full bottle of whiskey on his head. Leo falls, but he automatically presses the trigger, wounding Beth who was sitting in front of him.
Maggie helps Beth out of the room, .Sam picks the briefcase with the jewels collection, and Sheila stays back, puts the three bags of drugs in her handbag, rips off the man's fetish necklace to take as a souvenir, then she stomps Leo's chest repeatedly with her spiked high-heel sandal, stabbing him through the stomach until her pumps are slippery with blood.
On their way out, and in darkness, crossing the pool section of the mansion, Samantha punches Vickie to the jaw, and she falls into the pool, and Maggie hits the Dude on the head with a piece of rock and he falls face forward on the grass.(28:45) The fugitive women meet with the other four in the brown sedan, and they drive to somewhere with trees and shrubs, in the thick of the night. Joanie goes hysteric when she sees Beth is badly wounded, and Sheila shouts, ""What happened to Beth could've happened to any of us, it's the risk we take."" She doesn't stop crying, and Sheila slaps her.
""Leave her alone,"" says Carol, holding Sheila from behind. Sheila turns on her, in a rage, and they fight briefly in the darkness, rolling on the grass, pulling hair and ripping each other's evening dresses, until both women's breasts are uncovered.The fight is stopped by Joanie, who screams when her hands touch the gory pumps of Sheila...
Carol, declares that she is splitting from the group, and Maggie tells her, ""Whatever your share will be, we will give it to you somehow.""
Maggie takes a commander attitude then; she shoves Carol aside, saying: ""You and Joanie just get out of here! The rest of you get in the car because from now on we're traveling light...""A Santa Ana Officer drives by in a police car [Uncredited]. He sees the brown sedan leaving the scene with Carol, Joanie and the wounded Beth who wakes up from her faint during the fight scene, and Sam and Maggie standing by the blue sedan, inquires, ""Is everything alright, ladies?..."" and accepts Maggie's calm answer, ""Just resting our eyes, officer."" He drives on.Maggie keeps in command, shoving Sam, and moving quickly: ""C'mon! We're getting rid of this car, and then we're leaving!""
Next, the two girls conduct a car-jacking, forcing a Hairy Man (Barry Hostetler, 1974 Playgirl nude model, uncredited) at gun point to strip to his shorts, then shoot him - with a water-gun - and escape with his clothes and his light blue 1977 Chrysler Cordoba. On their way, they cross the black Mercedes with the two Arabs, all lights out, without noticing it.The 5 girls hide the jewels, except the scarab-ring that Maggie takes to herself, with just a light reproving exclamation from Sheila, ""Maggie!...""(34:20) The 5 girls arrive in the light blue car to the Filthy McNasty's, offering live entertainment in North Hollywood. A pair of men sitting at another table pay them a round of drinks, and Sheila leaves her table to sit with them. She offers to sell them a lot of ""good stuff"". Sheila goes out to the car park to show them the stuff - and Samantha follows them, worried because she knows Sheila has already drank too much. One of the man samples the stuff, and shows her his policeman's badge.
Sheila - wearing Leo's fatal necklace - says, ""Oh no!"" and pulls her water-pistol from her purse. The cop shoots first his real gun, and Sheila falls dead in front of Samantha, who hurries inside to inform her friends. She still has time to bury the ring at the feet of a Madonna statue at the entrance door.
The four girls try to reach the stolen car, but are arrested by the cops, for drugs possession. The cop says, ""Andere!"" [sic, Italian for ""Andare!"" meaning ""let's go""](40:05) Intertitle: ""...busted!!!""The 4 ""new girls"" are received in prison by a short blonde Guard (Claire Gable) who asks the women to deposit their valuables, ""all of them"" at the front desk. They're escorted to one of the prison's sections, and given a speech before they enter the cells, by the Head Guard, Terry (Georgia Morgan), a retired Navy commander with a deep voice, blond pompadour hair and dragon lady nails.
""I am Miss Terry (Georgia Morgan), and I'm in charge of this section. Now, I want you girls to know that I do not condemn your past mistake They were made up of a lack of guidance early in your lives...) It's my intention to see that you receive the proper guidance you need. (...) I'm ready to personally take time from my schedule to help any of the girls whenever they need, days or nights.""
Maggie rolls her eyes, and mutters, ""Especially at night."" The Head Guard pauses briefly, looking sideways at her, and continues, emphatically: ""Specially at night. Feel free to come to me with ay of your problems, and I know we'll solve them together. (...) Today is the first day of the rest of my life.""
Also listening are a couple of girls who seems to share some intimacy - Donna Moore (Leigh Reynolds), a beautiful redhead with stunning waist long hair, and a taller black-hair girl, Pam Jensen (Julie Wakefield) - and an assorted racial mix of Other Jail Prisoners - #3684 (Marie De La Rosa), #78 (possibly Tamasiro Kiyoko), another Japanese (possibly Sato Kaworu, seen only later at the shower line-up), brunette twins (Joan Keehr and Jerry Keehr, only one seen in close-up) and a stocky blonde (possibly credited as Jackie, seen only later topless at the shower line-up).
""Oh shit,"" mutters Sam.
That provokes Terry's explosion of bad temper, ""God dammit! No one speaks while I'm talking! Do you understand that?! All of you!... I'm in charge here!"" She quickly recomposes herself, and ends with, ""Now, in parting, I'd like to welcome you... aboard!""
Miss Robbins (Peggy Hayes), the big black guard, warns Samantha, now #7272, to be ware of Terry and Madge too, before she closes the door of her cell - which she shares with Maggie (whose tunic has no prison number), Liz #280, and Jill #3584. The girls resent being in prison for no reason, as they had no part in Sheila's tentative of selling the drugs...
Donna Moore (Leigh Reynolds), a beautiful brunette with stunning waist long hair, and her taller cellmate Pam Jensen (Julie Wakefield) offer friendship to the four new inmates, and warn them that the black girl, Jackie Kent (Juanita Morgan Copeland) and her friend Doris (Eileen Lee), a crazy girl with a doll, are dangerous; they also warn them against Madge (Jane Farnsworth), a ""hypocrytical religious old creep"" who enjoys banging a girl's head on the metal bars holding her by her hair. Donna tells them that escaping is not easy, because only Miss Terry has the whole lot of keys needed to get out; but if the new girls come up with a good escape plan from the inside, she and Pam will provide all the needed help outside.(49:10) Madge picks Samantha Sommers (Sherri Vernon), to Miss Terry's room, where she is drinking in a white nightgown, who offers her privileges in exchange for Sam to change her attitude towards her. Samantha rebuffs her advance, which infuriates her - but she doesn't go further than a hard slap, and verbal menaces. Only after Sam leaves, does Terry pick up a short horse whip, bending it with lust.Meanwhile, in the cells, Juanita calls Donna to her bed - and a lesbian tryst follows.(55:10) Shower time.
Jackie Kent, in her underwear, demands that Samantha lets her and her friend use the shower first. Sam, also in her bra and panties, insults Jackie, who slaps her hard. The two girls fight, with slaps, elbows to the midsection, a strangle. Maggie (Dixie Lauren) still in bra and panties, interferes and is attacked by the topless Doris (Eileen Lee).
Terry orders Miss Robinson not to interfere.
Samantha calls for Maggie's help, who is still fighting with Doris, and ends by knocking her down with a belly punch. Then, Maggie holds Jackie's arms from behind, and Sam is able to give a couple of good belly punches to the black queen-bee that floors her.
Warden Clark (Sonja Knowlton) is an imposing, tall brunette, who keeps notes on Miss Terry, and questions her about the incident, but does not seem to present any real menace to her, and Terry dismisses the fight as ""a commotion in the showers"".(59:00) Madge takes Samantha aside, and orders her to go on her knees in a room.
""Go to hell!"" says the young woman.
""I don't like violence!"" retorts the prison assistant, as she downs Sam with a punch to her right kidney.
Miss Terry, in a white negligee revealing her white bra, is enjoying the scene from the door, and holding a truncheon horse whip. When the girl was about to punch Madge's belly, Terry knocked her out with the truncheon. Sam woke up in her white nightshirt [Goof: The inmates did not had nightshirts to spend their nights.] and tied to a chair.
""We're going to straighten you up, Sam..."" promises Terry, as she holds now her horse whip, and Madge kneels, praying to Jesus. Terry empties a litter bin on the floor, and places the metal bucket over her head, beating on it to stun the girl, and next beating her exposed body with a rolled wet towel.
""I'll get you for this, Terry!"" says Sam through clenched teeth.
""Ha, this is the best part..."" smiles Terry, caressing her whip.
Next, Sam returns to her cell in the blue short tunic that is the regular uniform, sobbing.(64:00) Surprise search of the cells, for an allegedly knife that disappeared from the mess.
Not surprisingly, Madge finds the knife in Sam's cell, and accuses Maggie Benson for stealing it. ""I see..."" says Terry. Sam shouts out in defense of her friend, and Terry was about to hit her, when Maggie strangles her; Terry let's go her notepad and whip, and delivers a double karate chop to the tall girl's neck, who then is finished by Madge's uppercut to the jaw as she still holds a large bunch of keys in her hand. She gives a few kicks to the fallen tall girl. Sam tries to intervene, but she is grabbed from behind by Miss Robbins. She is sent to solitary, and later she is visited by Terry - while Jackie waits outside - and beaten with the horse whip.(67:10) Next morning, Jill and the redhead and Sam are mopping up the floor of the first floor corridor. Terry and Madge interrupt them, Terry sends the other two girls to another floor, and then sadistically tells Sam that she had paid a ""long visit"" to Maggie in solitary the previous night, and lets her alone to scrub the floor, and with a brush, forcing her to do that on her knees.Jackie and Doris find Jill alone on the scrubbing duty of the upper floor, and tease her.
Doris: ""Well, well... Look just who's here. Our good friend, Jill McLean.""
Jackie: ""Just when I was thinking of having a hell of a good'nd clean fun..."" She starts pulling the curly hair of Jill, who quickly answers by elbowing her to the stomach, punching Doris's face and picking up a mop stick and fighting Kent with it, who defends with a broom stick. Before Doris can attack her, Jill darts down the stairs, and hides in a cubicle to escape their pursuit.She changes her hiding place, and happens to overhear a conversation between Warden Clark and Ms. Cameron (Lynn Culver), trying to get the support of the short blonde guard against Terry, and failing. Jill tells Sam what she heard, but that night, she is sent alone to a cell, where Kent and Doris visit her, and rape her [off camera], and Samantha is sent to the solitary for two weeks.(74:00) Intertitle: ""The escape""After two weeks in solitary, Sam and Maggie, and the other two former Gold Miners, are ready to escape. Donna and Pam assure them that their boyfriends outside have everything ready for the escape.
That evening, Samantha pays a visit to Terry, and obeys her order to crawl on her stomach to kiss the dominatrix feet. Then she is allowed to sit by her on the bed - over which hangs an oil painting of Terry in her younger days. Terry rips Sam's tunic open, and starts kissing her breasts.
Jackie Kent calls Miss Robbins to take Jill out of her cell, because the girl looks ""to have appendicitis, or something"". Jill, once out of her cell, elbows the much bigger woman to the stomach, and knocks her out with a punch. Then she takes her keys, and opens all cell doors, but that of Kent and Doris.
Sam is still in her underwear when she karate chops Miss Terry to the neck, and knocks her out; she ties her face down on the bed, and then whips her with her own horse whip [off camera]. Then she dresses in Terry's uniform.
Samantha and her three teammates, plus Donna and Pam ambush Madge, Sam punches her to the crotch, and the others gang up on her, gag and tie her, and leave her inside a small cubicle.
Then a quick run down empty corridors of the technical section of the prison, opening one door after another, until the final fire door to the night outside - where a car was waiting for them as promised. They were a bit crowded until the meeting point with Donna's and Pam's boyfriends, and the two girls changed to their car.
The four escaping convicts, still in their prison uniforms, take a ride from a man driving a car in pitch black darkness, and they don't recognize he's Achim, and not even Maggie recognizes the Sheik's Mercedes. They ask him to drive them to the spot where they had buried the jewels, which he does. The girls dig up the earth, but can't find the loot they stashed.
Achim is waiting in the car, and Maggie asks him to stop at a nearby cantina - which is the Filthy McNasty's again - and returns quickly to the car, showing off the ring she had hidden there before their arrest. Achim leaves them at some hotel, and calls the Sheik from a public telephone outside - wearing new t-shirts and trousers or shorts - and promises he will retrieve the precious ring. He snicks into Sam and Maggie's room, and tries to take the ring, but Sam wakes up, and scream, and Achim has to flee before she puts the lights on.
Samantha and Maggie smoke and play cards till early morning - and Maggie exhibits her acrobatic skills and flexibility, by holding cards between her left foot toes, picking them with her right hand as she holds the cigarette with her left hand.In the morning, they were still asleep when Jill and Liz knock on their door to announce they were splitting - having bought new clothes at the shop's opening hour, and charging the cost to their hotel room. They say their good-byes and leave the hotel.
Next, they are visited by Achim - dressed as a sailor - who pretends to be the hotel manager and being unable to pay the heavy bill left by the four girls. He suggests the two young women may pay for the expenses at the hotel by working at a ""pleasure boat"" that belongs to the same company and is about ""to leave the port for the Mediterranean in two hours"".Thirty minutes later, Achim drives the girls to Pier #1, and presents them to the Yacht Steward (Sal Hasbun), who asks the girls again if they're willing to do anything, and if they can dance. They reluctantly answer yes.
In a minute, they are trained by two Belly Dancers, Samra and Anisha (credited as Samra and Cheryl Jensen), and start performing with the professional belly dancers.The Sheikh appears suddenly on the Yacht with a Police Officer (Neil Hays), saying, ""The officer is here to arrest you girls. However, I've recovered my jewels, and all the other jewels have been returned to their rightful owners, and I have now recovered [extending his right hand to Maggie's who quickly takes off the ring, putting it in his hand] scarab-ring, I decided to drop all charges against you girls.""
""In that case, you don't need me,"" the officer says.
The Sheikh dismisses him with a ""Thank you,"" and then, as he hugs delicately the bare shoulders of the two former Gold Miners turned violent women, ""Now... shall we have a little wine, in preparing for a happy journey ahead?""(95:00) Last intertitle: ""...So they sailed off into sunset, living happily ever after."""

Gloria is the only one with serious injuries so Marion suggests that they spend the night until Gloria is able to leave with them. Terry and Nancy are then invited to dinner with Marion and her old, crippled mother who berates Marion at every chance she gets, calling her a slut and a whore. Mrs. Penrose ruins dinner for everyone after going on a tirade of how horrible men are (specifically her ex-husband). The four then make their way to the living room and listen to Marion play the piano while outside a dirtied, grubby man appears, roaming around and looking menacingly into the windows.That night Terry and Nancy begin to discuss how weird the family is at the house and Terry finds a tooth under her bed. Nancy then decides to go through the woods and get help while later that night Terry awakes to hear a man masturbating. The next morning someone watches Nancy and Terry take a shower through a peephole in the bathroom wall. At breakfast the two tell Marion they're plan and Marion says it's a good idea, telling Terry to go get firewood. Nancy then sets off through the woods while Terry is frightened away from the shed out back by Marion because it's full of loose timbers. Nancy makes it through the thick forest, only to be gorily slashed to death by a figure with a long scythe. That night Terry finds that Nancy has not returned and becomes worried but Mrs. Penrose and Marion assure she's probably okay as once again, dinner is ruined by Mrs. Penrose's views on men and her daughter. That night Terry once again hears the breathing and goes to see who it is finding an abandoned little kids room with black and white pictures of two little kids and an old tool belt with a dusty gun and machete. She goes back to her room only to see the dirty, grubby man outside her window and runs screaming down the stairs into Marion's arms. Marion then calms her down and tells her that the man is her brother Carl who has the fundamental mind of a five year old and who their mother abandoned when she gave up on men. She insists that he is harmless and Terry admits to overreacting and goes back to bed.The next day Terry is once again worried about where Nancy is and Marion assures her that she's probably in town right then. Terry then goes up to see Gloria, who has become conscious now and the two begin to discuss on ways to get out of the house while the same person watches through another peep hole in the wall. Terry then goes outside to talk to Norman and asks if he's seen Nancy, telling him that she went through the woods only to have Norman freak out and warn her about a couple of girls disappearing in the woods around there. Night comes, and someone sneaks into Gloria's room and splits her head open with an axe. Terry goes upstairs and finds Gloria's room empty and asks Marion where she is. Marion tells her she may have went outside for a breath of fresh air so Terry searches for her outside. She calls for Gloria but finds Carl ready to attack her. After Carl chases her to the shed, Terry finds the dead bodies of her friends along with several other dismembered corpses. Carl breaks through the window and tries to grab her but she fights back and runs back to the house. After running back to the house and upstairs into the kid's room she takes out the dusty gun and shoots Carl in the head while an alarmed Marion comes running upstairs to find her brother dead with Terry recuperating in front of his corpse. When Marion questions her frantically about killing her brother Terry tells her to go look in the shed to which Marion tells her (in a deep, masculine voice) that Carl had nothing to do with what happened in the shed. Terry looks at Marion in shock as Marion pulls out the machete. She realizes that Marion is actually Mrs. Penrose's other son after glimpsing his chest hair. Marion brutally hacks a screaming Terry to death with the machete as he raves about having to pretend to be a girl, having to take care of Carl, and of how he had to kill all of the girls in the scary deep voice. Once Terry is dead, Mrs. Penrose calls for Marion downstairs asking if they had a man up there. Marion, covered in blood, denies being with a man in the feminine voice."

When a local mobster with an eye on man's property tries to take it from him, he must go to the town for the first time to get some help. Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port. One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction of a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat impounded and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Bud Spencer plays Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port (hence his name). One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss.
Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat taken away and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest. Unfamiliar with city life and only marginally literate, he falls prey to a con man named Manuel, who has a gift of the gab which has placed him in favor in several high positions, even with the country's President for his help in developing a remedy for a genetic defect in the Presidential family.
Eventually Joe meets Dorianne, an attractive singer, in a bar owned by Torsillo, where he gets a temporary job as a bouncer. Torsillo also runs into Joe personally time and again, and after having seen Joe easily finishing off five of his toughest goons, the gangster boss has taken to jumping out of the next window in a panic the instant he lays an eye on Joe.
In pursuit of his license, Joe finds out that he must get himself registered with the authorities in order to ""exist"" legally. Since he has no proper official records, however, this proves to be highly difficult, and the constrictions and loop-holes of bureaucracy provide no help in resolving the matter. Joe even has to enlist in the Army, but after driving his drill sergeant to the point of despair and even to degradation, he deserts and lands himself in prison when in his impatience he takes matters (literally) into his own hands. In prison he re-encounters Manuel, whom he intends to pay back for his schemes, but it turns out that the con man actually has a heart of gold: having taken pity on Joe's plight, he had used his connections to get Joe the much-needed license. From Dorianne, who visits him in prison, Joe learns that Torsillo has used his absence to facilitate the construction of the banana plant.
Joe and Manuel promptly break out of prison and return to Amantido, where Joe proceeds to thrash a newly built casino and Torsillo's thugs. Afterwards the police arrive, but not to arrest Joe. Instead they've been looking for Manuel: his remedy he had concocted for the President has worked, and Manuel (and Joe as well) receive amnesty as well as the fulfilment of a wish (Manuel decides to become Minister of Finance). To top it off, Torsillo is revealed to be no stranger to the authorities, and he and his entourage get arrested immediately. Dorianne decides to stay with Joe in Amantido, where she opens a school which Joe also attends, and Joe's life goes otherwise back to normal."

Bill talks to Joanne and complains about someone stealing his power drill. Afterwords, Joanne meets with Bobby Lee Tremble, who has arrived about the desks being sold from Dayton Hall. Bobby Lee mentions occasionally driving by the dormitory.That night, after playing pool, Patti goes for a beer and is startled when she sees Hemmit at the window. Brian runs outside to get Hemmit, but he returns without seeing him. The group then splits up to search for the bum. At home, Bobby Lee gives Joanne a ring and asks if she would like to ""get together"". His ""lady friend"", Alice, nags him about the phone calls, and Bobby Lee decides to go out for a drive.The next day, Bill goes to the bathroom to clean up. While he is washing his hands, the unseen killer shows up with the drill and ""returns"" the drilling by drilling right in the back of Bill's head.Brian and Craig are outside when Hemmit walks by. Craig confronts and threatens him to stay away from the dorm while Brian tells Craig to ""lay off"" Hemmit.An elaborate dinner is planned for the evening, but while Craig is getting candles, some food is stolen. Assuming that Hemmit is in the house, Craig searches for the bum, while Joanne goes to get the others. When she finally finds Brian, they all meet back at the table to see that someone has beaten the food and dishes with a baseball bat. The group gives a description of Hemmit to a police officer, who tells the students that it sounds like something the cops had picked up earlier.While on the telephone to her mother, Joanne hears noises on the room. She calls Patti, who comes over to Joanne's room. Joanne then realizes that the phones are now dead. Brian is seen playing pool when the power in the building goes out. While running up the stairs, he is attacked by the unseen killer with a machete. Craig joins Patti and Joanne to ask about the power failure. Craig and Patti go to check the fuse box. Once there, Craig is knocked unconscious, and Patti is murdered. Craig gets back to Joanne and tells her what happened. The two of them see Hemmit walking around outside, carrying a bloody machete. Arming themselves, Joanne and Craig go out in the hall to find and confront the killer.Soon they run into Hemmit, who knocks out Craig. Joanne runs and eventually finds Brian's dead body. Joanne grabs the machete from out of Brian's corpse and wounded Hemmit. He tells her ""You've got to trust me"". Not believing him, she hits him again with the machete. She meets again with Craig and Hemmit appears once again. While Joanne gets Hemmit's attention, Craig begins to struggle with him over the machete until Joanne intervenes and hits Hemmit on the head with a baseball bat, killing him at last. Craig seems very pleased and he says to Joanne: ""It's been me the whole time"". Suddenly realizing that Craig is the killer, Joanne runs away.Bobby Lee arrives at the dorm and hears Joanne's screams and cries for help. While hiding, Joanne is knocked out by Craig, and soon him and Bobby Lee are fighting over the machete. When Bobby Lee bests Craig and grabs the machete away from him, the police show up and see Bobby Lee standing over Craig with the machete. Mistakenly thinking that Bobby Lee is the killer, they pull out their guns and tell Bobby Lee to freeze. Craig, acting like a scared victim for the police officers, tells them that Bobby Lee has killed everyone and pleads to shoot him. Craig then sinisterly whispers to Bobby Lee that he is a ""dead man"". When Bobby Lee lunges for Craig, he is shot and killed by the policemen. The police help Craig to his feet who continues play-acting as a frightened survivor. He tells the officers that the rest of his friends are dead and they are up on the seventh floor. When the officers run out, Craig picks up the still unconscious Joanne, carries her to the basement to the incinerator and drops her inside. Joanne is burned alive screaming, while the murderous and psychotic Craig calmly walks out of the building having gotten away with everything. The policemen left in the building begin to wonder what the horrible stench is that just circulated all through the dorm."

The House Where Evil Dwells,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084096/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young American family moves to a House in Kyoto, Japan. It turns out to be haunted by the ghosts of a woman and her lover, who were killed by the woman's husband, as well as the ghost of the husband, who killed himself afterward. In 1840, a samurai comes home to find his wife in bed with another man, so he kills them both and then himself. Flash-forward to the present day, and an American family of three moves into this since-abandoned house and starts to experience incidents of haunting and possession.—Brian J. Wright <tyrannorabbit@hotmail.com> In the Kushiata region of 1840 Kyoto, Japan, a man and woman meet in a darkened house and fondle a small figurine of two lovers in a passionate embrace. As the man and woman make love, an older man arrives at the house and sees the lovers' silhouettes through the screen wall. Enraged, he slices through the barrier with his katana sword, destroying the room; he then chops off the younger man's head, stabs the woman, and kills himself. A storm blows the figurine into the rubble and encases the house in darkness.In contemporary Japan, an American diplomat named Alex goes to the airport to meet his two friends, Ted and Laura, and their young daughter, Amy, who have moved to Japan for Ted's job as a writer. In the car, Alex announces that he found a 200 year-old house for the family to rent at a low rate. He admits that the house is supposedly haunted, but Ted is excited by the idea. At the house, the family admires their spacious new home, and Alex says goodbye.That night, the light in Laura's room repeatedly turns off automatically, but Ted blames a faulty switch. Later, Ted awakens to see three blue, ghostly figures in the doorway, which disappear when he turns on the light. He and Laura make love. The next morning, a Zen monk arrives to warn Ted that the house contains dark spirits; he advises Ted to visit him at the temple should any problems arise.Meanwhile, Laura finds the figurine lodged under the stairs and shows it to her husband, who identifies it as a netsuke carving. While the couple talks, the female ghost walks into Laura's body. Laura asks Ted why Alex never married, and makes a suggestive remark about her feelings toward their friend. As Laura feels the spirit leave her body, she apologizes for her offhand comment.Later, at a street festival in Tokyo, Japan, Ted takes photographs of a woman he sees through his lens, but when he lowers the camera from his face, she disappears.Meanwhile, Alex telephones Laura to invite her and Ted to a party; the female ghost possesses Laura again, and she insists Alex come to visit her at the house. When Ted develops the photographs, the woman is missing from the frame. During dinner, the female ghost overturns a plate of food.On the night of the party, Laura puts the netsuke carving in her purse and dances with Alex, before taking him to a private garden where she kisses him. Ted leaves the event with three Japanese magazine agents who wish to discuss business. They drink, and, sometime later, Ted awakens from a drunken sleep in a restaurant booth, with a woman named Wakako draped over him. As he dances with her, she transforms into the woman Ted saw in his camera. She reveals her name to be Otami, but quickly changes back into Wakako.At the house the next morning, the sink faucet turns on automatically, causing Laura to become anxious. While she and Amy go shopping, the female ghost awakens Ted. Later, the older male ghost stabs his sword into Ted's desk, and the ghostly blue weapon turns to metal. Frightened, Ted visits the monk, who says that many years earlier, a young girl named Otami fell in love with Masanori, a samurai student of her husband, Shugoro. The monk explains the rest as Shugoro killed Masanori and Otami before killing himself.When Laura and Amy return home, Ted admires the demonic masks they purchased, but yells at his wife for spending so much money. He apologizes, however, and they embrace. During dinner, Amy sees a ghostly blue face in her soup, and refuses to eat. Shugoro's ghost possesses Ted, and he forces the soup down Amy's throat.The next morning, Ted urges Laura and Amy to accompany him on his business trip that day, but Laura insists they will be fine at home. After Laura sends Amy away with a babysitter, she invites Alex to the house and they make love.Meanwhile, Ted photographs a group of Japanese crab-divers called ""Ama."" Otami takes the form of one of the drivers and pulls Ted under the water.That night at the house, Laura receives a telephone call, informing her that Ted is in the hospital, and she leaves Amy home with the babysitter. As the girl sleeps, the male ghosts possess two large spider crabs and they chase Amy outside. The girl climbs a tree, but falls to the ground. When Ted and Laura return home, the police report that Amy has been hospitalized. Amy is sent back to the USA to recuperate.One week later, one of the masks flies off the wall and falls onto the table in front of Laura, prompting her to proclaim that she hates the house. Ted destroys the mask with a katana, which causes Laura to convulse in pain. After resting, Laura telephones Alex to end their affair, declaring that she loves her husband. Sometime later, the Zen monk explains that Amy swallowed the ghost's soul when she drank the soup, and instructs the family to return home the next day. He performs a ritual, scattering powder throughout the rooms and chasing the three ghosts outside. Laura cries, crouched in the corner of the room. The Zen monk tells Ted and Laura that the ghosts are gone, but not to let anyone inside the house until morning when he will return to exorcise the house to cleanse it of evil once and for all.Once the monk leaves, a guilt-ridden Laura tells Ted about her sexual tryst with Alex. Ted reacts very badly and responds by hitting Laura. Just then, Alex enters the house, and unknowingly lets the three ghosts inside with him. Ted then punches Alex, and the two men fight. As Otami possesses Laura, Shugoro enters Ted's body, improving his fighting skills. Finally, the ghosts motivation for creating all this mischief and mayhem becomes known: they have been plotting to reenact the tragic encounter in order to pass on to the afterlife. The possessed Ted and Alex duel with katanas until Ted gorily beheads Alex. Ted drives his sword into Laura's stomach before he commits suicide in the same manner from the opening scene. The three ghosts rise from the corpses and exit the house, leaving behind the netsuke carving."

Together the four pupils face the Five Element Ninja challenge: Wood, Earth, Gold, Water, and Fire.—Anonymous The ""Venoms"" were no more. After five years and more than a dozen films together, the only one of the original five who proved so successful for the director was the muscleman Lo Meng.

Tag: The Assassination Game,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084756/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"College assassination game turns deadly as someone starts playing for real. Susan participates in The Assassination Game, in which every player tries to shoot another with a toy dart gun, until only one remains. Pretending to do research for his newspaper, college student Alex Marsh teams up with the attractive Susan Swayze. While doing his best to win her over, and helping her finding her targets, Alex discovers that this year the Game may be more serious than most contenders realize...—Peter Zweers <peterz@pi.net> The central and pretty much only plot revolves around students at a college campus who are involved in a role-playing game called TAG which is an acronym for ""The Assassination Game"". The game is fairly straightforward, each player is assigned another player who they must assassinate by shooting him or her with a spring loaded dart gun. At the outset of the game each player is given a document called a Tag Victim Profile that contains a photo, the name, address, phone and class schedule of the player who he/she must kill. After a player completes the assignment he/she then takes over the assignment of the person who he/she killed and then notifies the game organizer, Nick Carpenter, of the kill so he can plot the kill on his game progress chart. Play continues in this manner until only one player remains at which point he or she is declared the winner.The movie follows the exploits of 2 TAG players, Susan Swayze who is playing for the first time and Loren Gersh who is the 5 time undefeated TAG champion looking to repeat yet again. He doesn't have much of a life besides playing TAG and devotes all his time to following players around and taking them out. At least one of these two characters is in every scene except for a few isolated occasions where the camera is concentrating on Alex Marsh. The only time other TAG players are shown is when they are interacting with Susan or Gersh.The movie opens with Gersh standing in a dorm hallway wearing a Get Smart style hat and trench coat while hiding behind a newspaper with eye holes cut out. His target approaches but then the target sees him and slowly backs away as he draws his dart gun but for some reason he is carrying an empty gun. When his target realizes he has no darts he turns and runs away as Gersh casually strolls after him Pepe' le Pew fashion. The target goes down a set of stairs and hides under a grate. On the sidewalk above footsteps are heard approaching and then leaving. Suddenly Gersh appears out of the dark, greets him, loads his dart gun and fires. The dart sticks to the forehead of the target and he then utters an expletive as he pulls it off.The next scene features Susan walking outside of a dorm as the clock tower strikes 9pm. While she is looking at the profile of her target, Shooster, she notices a car signaling somone in a dorm room by flashing its headlights then the person in dorm room responds by turning the room lights on and off. In the meantime someone else is in a phone booth in front of the dorm and says, ""she's right here I can't talk"". Susan brushes the signaling off and enters the dorm anyway. Shooster makes sure that Susan sees him then walks down the stairs to the laundry room with a laundry basket in his hands. She follows him and enters the laundry room but it appears to be empty. She doesn't see that he is hiding in a dark corner behind a dryer. As she is about to leave she hears him move and opens a washing machine door just in time for it to block a dart that was headed for her. They proceed to shoot at one another until she can't find another dart at which point she runs away. He finds a dart, loads his gun and follows. To escape Susan ducks into Alex Marsh's dorm room to hide. Alex tries to talk to her but she shushes him. Susan leaves almost as abruptly as she entered. Alex gets out of bed and opens his door to see where she went. Susan walks down the hall as Shooster and Charlie, another player, suddenly pop out of different doors with Susan in the middle of them. As they fire Alex tells Susan to look out, she ducks and they end up shooting one another instead. The three players walk away together laughing as Alex stands speechless in his underwear. Alex finds Susan extremely attractive so he is determined to find her to try to get to know her. Alex writes for the school paper and plans to use the pretext of writing an article about TAG to meet Susan and follow her around. He visits the office of Nick Carpenter, the game organizer, locates Susan's file and discovers where she lives.Susan's roomate Nancy is also playing TAG and in fact it is made clear later that she is the one who got Susan involved in the game. Nancy and Susan realize they are being followed by Nancy's assassin, Randy, so Nancy decides to use a trick to get rid of him. Susan observes while Nancy goes to the pool, changes into her bathing suit, hides a mini-dart gun in her bikini bottom and then pretends to drown in the pool. Randy jumps in with his clothes on to save her but after he lifts her out of the pool she shoots him with a dart.In the meantime another TAG player, Swanson, is heading to the bathroom to take a shower. He has his dart gun with him and places it on the soap dish in the shower stall. Gersh is hiding in a stall with his feet on the toilet so that Swanson doesn't know he is in the bathroom. Gersh opens the shower curtain and while lecturing him about not being careful enough, Swanson knocks his dart gun on the floor. The gun hits the floor, fires and the dart hits Gersh. Gersh is extremely upset at being hit for the first time and protests that it doesn't count because it was an accident. He then unsuccessfully tries to bribe Swanson to start over as if nothing had happened. To prevent
Swanson from reporting him dead to Carpenter, he retrieves a real Beretta 92 from his dorm room, returns to the shower and murders him. He then uses a laundry cart to wheel the corpse to his dorm room closet.Alex goes to visit Susan and tells her that he is writing an article about TAG and needs to follow a player around in order to learn about the game. Susan agrees to let him accompany her only if he helps her win, he agrees and she gives him his first assignment, to go warm up her car. In the meantime, after contemplating his actions, Gersh is somewhat depressed and calls Carpenter to tell him he killed Swanson as if asking for guidance. Carpenter doesn't realize he means he killed Swanson for real, he thinks he meant he shot him with a dart. So Carpenter notes the kill on his progress chart and tells Gersh to keep up the good work. Carpenter's encouragement cheers Gersh up and at that point the limited remaining grasp he had on reality vanishes. Though he has no need to use the real Beretta to silence anyone else, he proceeds to use it to murder the remaining contestants unlucky enough to become one of his assigned kills and also dumps their bodies in his closet.Next Alex starts Susan's car as some girls, who are obviously out to get Susan, are snickering in the background. Susan yells for him to drive and pick her up. As he does the girls come out of the dark giving chase on foot but the car pulls away too fast for them to get a shot off. Susan has Alex park in the Delta House fraternity lot next to the car of her target. Alex questions Susan while they wait for her target to come out. Susan loses track of time and realizes he closed his room light and is approaching. She kisses Alex just as her victim reaches her car with his gun drawn. He figures they are just making out so he turns around to get in his car. Susan then shoots him in the back through her window which was rolled down.In the next scene Nancy and Susan are in class. Nancy tells Susan she is dating Randy and that she is not playing TAG anymore because instead she going to Randy's track practice then she is going away with Randy to his Parent's beach house and the following day to a concert together. Gersh is seen in the widow spying on them. It shortly becomes clear that Nancy is the one he is targeting. He tails her to the track meet and sneaks under the bleachers right behind her. Gersh shoots and kills her at the same exact time the coach fires a blank to start the race. Gersh then reports the kill to Carpenter and transports her body to his room.Frank, who is apparently an editor at the school paper, approaches Alex and tells him that there are two missing students and tries to convince him to write an article about it but Alex tells him he is still busy with his TAG feature. At first blush it appears that the second missing student was Nancy. However, it is implied that both are males because not even their ""girlfriends"" know where they are and is later revealed that this second missing student was a different TAG player who Gersh killed. The second kill was never shown on film nor does Gersh report it to Carpenter anywhere in the movie, which would have cleared things up sooner. Thus the audience is not aware of it and most assume the report was referring to Nancy. This makes one wonder why Susan is not worried. Randy eventually reports Nancy missing towards the end of the movie and since Nancy told her that she was going away Susan never suspects anything is wrong by her absence.Alex goes to meet Susan but can't find her at first. Susan calls the Campus Information desk and asks to speak to Alex. She tells him that she is hiding in the nearby phone booth and needs his help because she is out of darts and her assigned assassin, Wallace, is waiting outside the phone booth to get her. He makes an announcement over the loudspeaker that there is a free concert in a different hall and a large crowd including Wallace run to the location of the alleged concert. This permits Susan to escape and they spend the day together.Later that evening while Susan and Alex are spying on Gowdy, her assigned target, she notices that Wallace is again tracking her. She tells Marsh to keep an eye on Gowdy while she goes off to get rid of Wallace. She goes to the pool locker room and changes into her bathing suit, planning to try the same drowning trick that Nancy demonstrated to her. In the meantime Alex sees Gersh lurking about and asks him if he is looking for Wallace. Gersh answers yes and Alex tells him to go to the pool to find him. While Susan is under the water Gersh shoots and kills Wallace. Susan exits the pool perplexed and while searching for Wallace encounters Alex who tells her he took care of Wallace but lost Gowdy. They run to the athletic building and again part company as she says she will take the front and he should take the back.While lying in wait Susan shoots Alex as he walks through the door thinking he is Gowdy. Alex then proceeds to step on the dart breaking it. Susan states that she had only one dart for her mini dart gun and asks Alex to go back to her locker to get her primary weapon while she spies on Gowdy. Gowdy returns and starts searching rooms, the last room is where Susan is hiding. Alex is unable to remember the locker combination and thus fails to get her gun. He sees Gersh and runs up to him and asks if he got Wallace. Then he said he did Gersh a favor and in return wants to borrow Gersh's gun. Gersh gives him the dart gun and Alex tosses it to Susan just in time for her to shoot Gowdy before he found her. Naturally the final two players left at this point are Gersh and Susan.Game rules dictate that a party be held before the final round between the two remaining players can commence so a party is scheduled the next evening and play is suspended for a 21 hour period until after the party ends. Susan and Alex use the break to spend the night together in her room. Alex leaves in the morning but proceeds to smother her throughout the day with flowers and notes professing his love. Susan is put off and tries to avoid him and refuses to answer her phone. When he approaches her at the party she tells him she needs space and is not sure when and if she wants to see him again. She tells him that she wants to handle the final round on her own rather than with his help, despite telling him the previous night that she wanted his help.After the party the final round commences. At 9pm Gersh calls Susan and challenges her to meet him in the quad. During the course of playing cat and mouse Susan hides in Gersh's room to try a sneak attack when he returns but she finds the corpses in the closet and runs away screaming in panic. Interestingly only 3 bodies are shown, Nancy, Swanson and Wallace, despite the fact it is later implied that he murdered 5. Gersh sees her running from his room and tries to get her before she can tell anyone. She runs screaming to the College rent-a-cop but as he loads a round into his revolver Gersh shoots and kills him. He proceeds to chase her to the roof of a building.In the meantime Alex drowns his sorrows with journalistic work, specifically investigating the rash of missing college students. He visits campus security as Randy is reporting Nancy missing. At this point it becomes clear that Nancy was not the second missing student, another player was. Apparently 2 players never shown in the film were killed offscreen, one named M. Homes and the other we are simply given the last name March. Alex recognizes Wallace and pieces together that all the missing students played TAG and were taken out by Gersh. He surmises that Gersh harmed them for real and then sets out in search of Susan to warn her. Alex finds the dead security guard and picks up the gun not realizing there was only 1 round in it. Then he hears the sound of glass breaking coming from the rooftop and runs to investigate. Gersh is about to shoot Susan when Alex appears. Alex fires at Gersh but nothing happens and then fires 4 more times to no avail. Gersh is amused by this and at first simply laughs but after the 5th click he takes aim at Alex. Alex pulls the trigger one final time and at last a bullet fires hitting Gersh who then falls off the roof to his death. The movie ends with Alex consoling Susan."

It had Goldie as the director,LP as music directors; and Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Rajesh Khanna, Vinod Khanna as the lead actors. Following her phenomenal success in Laila Majnu,the gorgeous Ranjeeta was also roped in. As if that was not enough, they also signed Tina Munim some time in the middle of the project. Unfortunately, the movie took seven years to see the light of the day, and it turned out to be only an average box office earner.
There is no satisfactory explanation available as to why it took so long. Maybe there were problems with the dates of the overworked stars. To a viewer, the main problem appears to be the the weak story-line which ,it seems, was revised again and again, and it became weaker with each revision. The characters played by Dharmendra and Hema Malini are deeply in love, and they get physically intimate, but their parents-Om Shivpuri and Rehman- are sworn enemies. The result is that Hema gets married to the character played by Rajesh Khanna, and Dharmendra goes to jail as he kills the dacoit who attacks Hema Malini's Doli. Hema gives birth to Dharmendra's son who is raised by Rajesh Khanna as his own son, even though he knows the truth. Bhanu (Vinod Khanna) is in love with Kamali( Ranjeeta) who gets raped by Ranjeet who plays a tyrant ex ruler. Ranjeet is a widower who has a daughter from his first marriage-played by Tina Munim. Vinod Khanna forces Ranjeet to marry Ranjeeta, and kidnaps the daughter (Tina Munim) to settle the scores. Predictably, the kidnapped daughter falls in love with the kidnapper. In spite of the multi star billing, the bizarre twists to the story lead to the evident asymmetry in the relationships as Hema is the heroine for both Dharmendra and Rajesh Khanna; and Vinod Khanna is the hero for both Ranjeeta and Tina Munim.
I give full marks to Goldie as he managed to make a watchable movie even though the project dragged for seven years for whatever reasons. Among the actors, Rajesh Khanna has performed the best. Physically, he looks less of a Rajput if you compare him with Dharmendra,Vinod Khanna, and Ranjeet. But his role was meatier, and he did full justice to it as the devoted lover, committed husband, caring and loving foster father, and a brave and intelligent Police Officer. Dharmendra didn't have much scope in the story. Vinod Khanna didn't have too much scope either, but he was the director's darling. Goldie sure gave special importance to his Guru Bhai ( Ref Acharya Rajneesh) ,Vinod Khanna, who gets significant footage particularly during the climax. It should be mentioned that while Goldie and Mahesh Bhatt had deserted Rajneesh, Vinod Khanna was still with the Godman and even went with him to America.He could shoot for the film only when he visited India.
The girls were totally ignored except for some scintillating scenes of Hema Malini. Ranjeet was too young to play Tina's father and certainly inadequate to be the main villain. I recall when I first saw this movie, my fellow viewers wondered why Prem Nath was not there in the movie.
Certainly a watchable film.
The names of the actors should be taken to mean the characters played by them in the film."

On being asked by his grandfather about his future plans, Ravi promptly replies that he wants to become a police officer and serve his country, just like his grandfather. Kumar tells him that the journey of being a police officer is fraught with many arduous challenges, and Ravi should reconsider his decision. Kumar starts by explaining his own life story in a flashback.Kumar had a happy family consisting of him, Sheetal (Rakhee Gulzar), Ravi's grandmother, and son Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan), Ravi's father. In the course of purging the city of crime, Ashwini takes up cudgels against a dreaded gangster named J.K. Verma (Amrish Puri). He arrests a key henchman of J.K. named Yashwant (Goga Kapoor) in order to decimate J.K.'s supremacy and to track him down.
However, J.K. takes matters into his own hands and abducts Vijay. J.K. calls up Ashwini and tries to strike a deal: Yashwant's freedom in lieu of Vijay's life. Ashwini, a virtuous cop, tells J.K. on the phone that even if his only son is killed in the process, he will not betray the law. Unbeknownst to Ashwini, however, the conversation is being tape recorded. When Vijay listens to his father's voice on the tape recorder, he is shocked and pained to hear his father's words and his lackadaisical attitude towards his own flesh and blood.With no help forthcoming, Vijay takes it upon himself to escape his abductors. Whilst the entire gang is searching for Vijay, K.D. Narang (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), another goon in J.K.'s gang, finds Vijay but pities the helpless child and helps him escape to safety.

Narang and J.K. become sworn enemies after J.K. discovers that Narang was behind Vijay's escape. Ashwini doesn't know that JK was behind Vijay's kidnapping or that Yashwant worked for JK. JK's identity was hidden from Ashwini.As the years pass by, Vijay, who has now become a young man, begins resenting his father and his father's love for upholding the law. During a chance encounter, Vijay rescues a young lady named Roma (Smita Patil), Ravi's mother, from 4 rowdy men led by Satish (Satish Shah) who try to molest her. Vijay and Roma begin to form a close relationship.
meanwhile JK is now a successful businessman, though Ashwini suspects him of being a smuggler and keeps a close watch on him. Satish complains against Vijay for thrashing him in the train and Ashwini calls Vijay to the police station. Vijay recites the truth (& produces Roma as a witness), but this only increases the distance between Vijay and Ashwini.
During a job interview for the post of Assistant Manager of a Hotel, K.D. Narang, the owner of the hotel, happens to be passing by. He interjects the interview and promptly hires Vijay. Vijay remembers K.D. Narang as the person who had saved his life and decides to work in whatever capacity required with the man he perceives he owes his life to.
Ashwini knows that KD is a smuggler and warns Vijay not to work for him. But Vijay is adamant and ignores Ashwini and says that KD is the man who saved him, when his own father refused to.Ashwini resents the growing proximity between Vijay and K.D. Narang, so he asks Vijay to leave his house. Vijay moves in with Roma, and they start living together, without marriage. Sheetal tries to persuade her son to leave the path of wrong, but in vain.
The duo, J.K. and K.D., have now become sworn enemies in their illegal businesses, so J.K. decides to remove his thorns before they suck the blood out of him and his business. J.K. tries to get K.D. murdered, but Vijay rescues K.D. with his presence of mind. Vijay reminisces to K.D. how Vijay owes his life to K.D., and now Vijay becomes K.D.'s, right-hand man. J.K. is infuriated at his men for failing to kill Narang. His men tell him that Vijay spoiled the plan. Enraged, J.K. creates a plan to kill Vijay first, followed by Narang, and then Ashwini.One night, while Vijay and Roma are at a restaurant, a drunk man named Ganpat Rai (Dalip Tahil) attempts to propose to Roma, but Vijay beats him up, causing two men dressed in blue clothes to come forward and escort Rai out of the hotel. It turns out that these two men hired Rai to act foolish and drunk. A few minutes later, one of the men stabs Rai to death. The next morning Vijay returns home, but Ashwini's men follow him. Ashwini's most loyal officer, Sudhakar (Vikas Anand), possesses a warrant claiming Vijay had murdered Rai. Vijay is taken into police custody, but when KD bails Vijay out, Vijay is released from prison, and he begins to work with K.D. full-time.Later, Roma reveals to Vijay that she is pregnant with his child, who is Ravi, so Vijay marries her.
When Narang's truck of goods is stolen by J.K., Vijay requests Narang to let him take charge of bringing the truck back. Vijay tracks down JK. When Vijay sees J.K. passing by, he captures him. Vijay tells J.K. that he was the same boy whom J.K. had abducted from school, and that he has been waiting for his revenge for years, much to J.K.'s horror. After a heated battle with J.K.'s men, Vijay drives Narang's truck back to him.
Vijay is now a noted criminal and Ashwini breaks all connects with him. Vijay goes to meet Sheetal, but she also refuses to go with him to his life bought from criminal proceeds.Ashwini almost arrests Vijay red handed during a diamond deal. One of Narang's henchmen Lobo (Sharat Saxena) is captured by Ashwini, but Vijay manages to escape after a lengthy car chase.
When journalists cross-question Ashwini about his conflict of interest - his own son being a renowned gangster in K.D.'s gang, but he is the Deputy Commissioner of Police - the Commissioner of Police (Ashok Kumar) asks Ashwini to forego the case. Ashwini, however, requests for 48 hours to capture and bring Vijay and the other nefarious gangsters to justice, failing which Ashwini will resign. K.D., Vijay and most of J.K.'s gangsters are arrested, but J.K. remains absconding. J.K. takes it upon himself to eliminate his troubles once and for all by murdering Ashwini. Instead, Sheetal is killed by J.K. himself whilst trying to shield her husband.
An enraged Vijay, who is imprisoned at the time of Sheetal's murder, escapes the police and proceeds to start hunting for J.K.'s head. Vijay finds a den where four of J.K.'s men are present. Vijay tells them he has nothing against them, and only wants J.K., but the gangsters attempt to murder him. However, Vijay succeeds in killing all of the men. During the interrogation of one of J.K.'s henchmen, Vijay learns that J.K. has plans to leave India using fake passport. Vijay then kills the man, who drowns.Following up on the tip, Vijay arrives at the airport, and ultimately succeeds in killing J.K., who is in a disguise, thereby avenging his mother's death. Ashwini succeeds in tracking down Vijay and asks Vijay not to escape, but in vain. A teary-eyed Ashwini pulls the trigger, mortally wounding his son in the process. Ashwini rushes towards him, and in a tearful goodbye, Vijay realizes his mistake and asks for forgiveness, saying to his father that he always loved him very much.The scene cuts to the present, and a tearful Ashwini reiterates to Ravi, asking him whether he wants to follow his decision of being a police officer. Ravi, despite hearing the heartbreaking story, firmly replies in the affirmative. Kumar and Roma, Ravi's mother, Vijay's widow give Ravi their blessings. Ravi takes a train and leaves, signifying that he would become an officer in the future."

Ruby hit on Adhir but when she was caught she claims that he tried to rape her. Ruby hit him with a hunter and set her dogs on him and Adhir went mad with that behavior.
Sudhir asks Ruby to run away with her and asks Hiralal to meet him at his house. Hiralal witnesses firsthand how his love for Ruby was one-sided and Ruby considered him a dim wit. Hiralal leaves. Sudhir reveals that he is Adhir's brother and wanted revenge against Ruby for the treatment meted out to his brother..Prashant brings lots of cash into the house..

She tells Sudhir what has happened..
Sudhir removes all hospital records of the case, but Prashant thinks that Sudhir informed the police. Sudhir goes to Kavita for the evidence that Nandita gave her, but Kavita also thinks that Sudhir is trying to implicate Prashant. She says Sudhir is trying to destroy Prashant as he could not get Kavita. Sudhir agrees with her and leaves.
Sudhir tries to pay off Nandita to leave Bombay, but she is adamant to see Prashant convicted. So, Sudhir injects Nandita with an empty syringe, which kills her.Sudhir tells police that he was the actual culprit and changes all hospital records to prove that. In return, he takes the word of Prashant and Kavita to use medical profession to serve people, not to earn money. They give him their word and do exactly the same.

Parsifal,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084476/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Richard Wagner's last opera has remained controversial since its first performance for its unique, and, for some, unsavory blending of religious and erotic themes and imagery. Based on one of the medieval epic romances of King Arthur and the search for the holy grail (the chalice touched by the lips of Christ at the last supper), it recounts over three long acts how a ""wild child"" unwittingly invades the sacred precincts of the grail, fulfilling a prophecy that only such a one can save the grail's protectors from a curse fallen upon them. Interpreters of the work have found everything from mystical revelation to proto-fascist propaganda in it. Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's production doesn't avoid either aspect, but tries synthesize them by seeking their roots in the divided soul of Wagner himself. The action unfolds on a craggy landscape which turns out to be a gigantic enlargement of the composer's death mask, among deliberately tatty theatrical devices: puppets, scale models, magic-lantern projections. The eponymous hero is sung by the specified tenor voice (Reiner Goldberg) but mimed on screen by a male and a female performer alternately, reflecting what the director takes to be the creator's own sexual conflicts. Syberberg's pacing, dictated by the majestic pace of Wagner's score, is slow, but enlivened by constant subtle shifts in point of view, and memorable performances by actress Edith Clever as the villainess/heroine Kundry (sung by Yvonne Minton), orchestra conductor Armin Jordan as the remorseful knight Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schoene), and Robert Lloyd (the faithful retainer Gurnemanz).—Roger Downey"

Fall Guy,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082601/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A lowly obsequious member of a movie star's entourage agrees to marry his boss's pregnant mistress so he can continue his feckless lifestyle. He then takes up dangerous work as a stunt man to support his new family. Duty and loyalty turn into something deeper. Aging Kamata movie star ""Gin-chan"" Ginshiro (Morio Kazama) is filming a story about Samurai in Imperial Japan at the start of the Meiji. Also appearing in the movie, as his antagonist, is rising young star Tachibana (Daijiro Harada). While Tachibana is being filmed, Ginshiro and his crew of bit-player lackeys become upset that Tachibana is receiving more close-ups and more daring scenes. When he takes his turn on camera, Ginshiro overacts and hams up the scenes, ensuring lots of face time on the camera. This desperate attention seeking upsets Tachibana as well as the film crew.After the shoot, Ginshiro is approached by Makoto (Toshiya Sakai), an adoring young fan, who flirtatiously asks him to sign her inner thigh. Ginshiro charms her, and she giddily thanks him and leaves in her car. Ginshiro, annoyed at his lackeys for not sealing the deal and getting her number for him, enlists his most trusted lackey Yasu (Mitsuru Hirata) to chase after her car and get her number. After a daring and stupid move, Yasu succeeds. But in a mood swing later, frustrated that he is losing popularity, Ginshiro gets drunk at a local bar and, upset at the lack of admiration received from the bar patrons, he goes on a rampage, which Yasu and the other lackeys manage to stop.Ginshiro visits the cramped apartment of Yasu with his actress girlfriend Konatsu (Keiko Matsuzaka), begging Yasu to marry Konatsu because she is pregnant, and the story could ruin Ginshiro's already waning career. Expressing this fact depresses Ginshiro, who demands Yasu watch as he forcibly has sex with Konatsu.Yasu agrees to marry Konatsu, partly due to his sense of duty to Ginshiro, but partly because he has been a fan of Konatsu since her first movie. Ginshiro insinuates angrily that it is also because Yasu cannot get a woman any other way.Ginshiro has an argument with the director of the film over a climactic scene involving Ginshiro fighting off dozens of samurai on a 30-foot staircase; the studio has cut the scene declaring it is too dangerous and no one will play the part of the samurai that Ginshiro victoriously kicking a samurai down the staircase. None of Ginshiro's available lackeys will do it, either, as everyone is afraid such a fall would be fatal.Yasu takes to the task of providing for pregnant Konatsu dutifully, though Konatsu is unhappy to lose Ginshiro but also feels like a marriage to Yasu is a badge of shame, and chides him for being a weak man. Yasu begins to take on any bit part he can get his hands on, no matter how dangerous, often using the appeal ""my girl is pregnant"" to justify taking on a full plate of dangerous roles. He uses each little bit of cash to front a number of installment-plan purchases of home furnishings to provide Konatsu with a more comfortable lifestyle, including buying her a bed and opting to sleep in his own closet. Konatsu begins to warm slowly to Yasu. In a gesture of farewell, Konatsu uses her key to Ginshiro's unkempt apartment to clean it up for him, and leaves her key behind.Meanwhile, Ginshiro is having relationship problems with Mokoto, and asks Konatsu to talk to her and sing his praises, which she tries to do, and flighty young Mokoto returns to Ginshiro's arms, which makes Konatsu uncomfortable. She returns to Yasu, who she decides to devote herself to, bringing him lunch while on the job and taking care of his tiny apartment.Yasu and Konatsu travel to Kyushu to meet his family, where they are greeted with lots of fanfare. Yasu's family is clearly excited and impressed that Yasu has managed to get engaged to such an attractive and illustrious woman, but Yasu's mother suspects the sham behind the arrangement, and pleads with Konatsu not to break her son's heart. Konatsu retires to the bedroom, where Yasu has been awkwardly trying to decide whether to try to get more intimate with Konatsu. Ultimately, she moves their pillows next to each other, reminding him that they are to be married, and therefore should act like it, and they sleep together.Returning to Kamata, Konatsu dives headfirst into her future with Yasu, trying to discard her past spoiled actress lifestyle and fully prepares for a dutiful married life with Yasu. However, she visits the Toei set and runs into Ginshiro, who is depressed after losing Mokoto. After reminiscing over their fun-loving past together, Ginshiro puts a Y30M gemstone ring on Konatsu's finger, asking her to marry him instead. Konatsu refuses, stating that she is beginning to love Yasu, and also feels compelled not to disappoint the pleas of Yasu's mother. Jilted, Ginshiro runs off. The scene shifts into Konatsu's happy wedding to Yasu.Konatsu and Yasu move into a better apartment, and Konatsu takes on the role of a willing wife, having decided that a life with well-meaning and willing Yasu is the best for her and her child. Word gets around that Ginshiro has gone missing, which is holding up production of the film. Yasu, still feeling loyalty to Ginshiro, searches the city to look for him, finally finding his car parked outside an abandoned warehouse. Upstairs, he finds a sulking, depressed Ginshiro, who laments that his star has faded, and expresses a wish that his career end with a bang -- the dangerous staircase scene. Yasu offers to take on the dangerous role of the samurai who falls down the huge staircase, partly out of devotion to Ginshiro, but also sees a way to use the opportunity to provide handsomely for Konatsu.The studio director, thrilled at Yasu's offer, gets him Y1M in hazard pay; meanwhile, Yasu arranges for a Y100M insurance policy on himself, expecting that the chance of him dying in the stunt will result in a payoff for those he loves. He includes both Konatsu and Ginshiro as beneficiaries. Konatsu, however, does not want Yasu to take on such a dangerous stunt and possibly die. As his sense of selfless generosity and the demands of bit playing and the stress of his devotion to both Konatsu and Ginshiro take its toll, he starts falling apart, handing out pieces of the insurance payoff to all his fellow bit players, taking advantage of the risky plan to gain friends and respect. After he brings home a horde of random strangers (all of whom have become beneficiaries of his insurance policy) and invites them to eat Konatsu's dinner for him, she angrily kicks them out, and begins to beg Yasu not to do the scene. He has a nervous breakdown and begins violently trashing everything in the apartment, while Yasu pleads with him to calm down. He rants in spite about everything including the difficult position of raising a child that isn't his, something he didn't mind at first. After recklessly hitting her, he crumbles, and begins to simper about the pressures of the movie industry, in which he does ""everything my superiors ask of me"" without much in return, and expresses his frustrations with his life, and how his increasing love and devotion to Konatsu weighs on his emotional state. Ashamed, he leaves to go to the set, leaving a heartbroken, still devoted Konatsu behind.The next day, Konatsu packs up and leaves to go to the hospital; meanwhile, Yasu goes to the set, having finally given up all self worth. He refuses to eat before the shoot. Preparing for the scene, he takes advantage of everyone's amazement and respect at his role, acting like a diva, even getting Tachibana to light his cigarette, and angrily railing against the studio executives who have personally arrived to watch the dramatic scene.With her baby not yet ready to be delivered, Konatsu leaves the hospital and walks to Toei Studios, hoping for another chance to stop Yasu from doing his dangerous stunt. Meanwhile, the studio starts the scene. Ginshiro, playing the antagonist Imperial Guard, marches up the staircase with his men, dispatching a team of samurai, led by Yasu, every few steps, Near the top, Ginshiro and Yasu fight, and Yasu, true to his proud job as a bit player, tumbles recklessly down the stairs. Broken and bleeding, he weakly recovers, and begins crawling back up the stairs. Ginshiro cheers him on for his extreme devotion to the scene; eventually he runs out of steam, and tumbles back down. Outside, Konatsu watches as medics load Yasu into an ambulance; at that moment, Konatsu's water breaks.Konatsu wakes in the hospital, hearing her baby crying for her. She hears Yasu's voice, but refuses to open her eyes, fearing his voice may be a dream. She opens her eyes to find Yasu, heavily bandaged, doting over her; they can all live happily ever after now. Just then, the hospital room walls are pulled apart, revealing it is a small set built on the same soundstage as the huge staircase, surrounded by the movie cast and crew, celebrating the end of the movie, a sendoff to the story's original beginnings as a stage play."

Dalton (Stockard Channing) wants to write a story about a gruelling three thousand kilometer auto rally through Africa. When her deal to ride with a driver falls through, she hires ex-stuntman Eddie Miles (David Carradine), who is racing against his former employer, the ruthless Count Borgia (Sir Christopher Lee), who becomes their hardest and meanest competitor in the rally. Borgia and his sidekick Feodor (Hamilton Camp) do all they can to thwart the other drivers, but luck and love are on J.J. and Eddie's side.—skpurplevamp A helicopter lands at an African horse ranch. Inside are Count Lorenzo Borgia (Christopher Lee) and his sidekick Feodor Gomez (Hamilton Camp); they have come to race the count's two cars in the 5th African International Rally and meet movie stunt driver Eddie Miles (David Carradine), who will drive the second car. Eddie wants to get down to business and the two drivers take a competitive turn around the ranch. Eddie swerves and causes Borgia to go off the road and wreck a fountain. Insulted, Borgia warns Eddie about the reputation of his family, but decides to show mercy and merely fire him; Eddie says he plans to enter the rally himself.Meanwhile, a photojournalist for Playboy magazine named J.J. Dalton (Stockard Channing) surprises her boss with an idea for an article: a friend, Freddie Selkirk (Ian Yule) is in the race and wants her to navigate the course for him. At first he is reluctant to give her the assignment as she gets too deeply involved in her work and into trouble as a result (for an article on prostitution, she posed as one and got arrested), but she mentions that she will be 13,000 miles away for the article, so he happily agrees.She calls Freddie when she gets to the hotel, but he is in the middle of fighting off invaders during a regional battle, the car they planned to race in is bombed and he is beheaded by an insurgent. J.J. proceeds to get a second-rate jalopy at a used car dealer, determined to enter the race somehow, and ends up paired with Eddie when he can't find a navigator. He demonstrates his talent for driving using her rental car, and it puts up with the abuse of stunt driving long enough for them to return it to the rental shop before it falls apart. Her ""race car"" is nearly useless without a proper engine, so he suggests she dress in something nice and wrangle an interview with Count Borgia while he steals the engine from the second car to put in their own. At the hotel J.J. interviews the count while a cheetah named Caligula relaxes nearby. When Feodor drops the count's gift for J.J. in a wine glass, Borgia orders him to jump from the hotel balcony, which he reluctantly does. In a panic, J.J. excuses herself and races downstairs to the lobby to tell the desk clerk what happened, not knowing that Feodor had a parachute. As she tries to explain he re-enters the lobby trailing the chute.The next day is the start of the race. Teams include Britons and Australians, a team of housewives, a French team and others from around the world. J.J. and Eddie get assigned the last number, 91. As they get to know each other on the course, J.J. makes a remark that she is his navigator, not his wife, and he says not to use that four-letter word. He divorced on grounds of sexual perversion (hers, not his), but he won't say any more on the subject, even when J.J. admits she has done some raunchy things in her life (and won't say what)..Borgia stops at a bridge and orders Feodor to blow it up to eliminate most of the competition. Feodor assures his boss they are standing in a safe spot, having reviewed explosions and the resulting ""angle of debris,"" but some of the fallout from the blast hits the branch on which they're standing and propels them into the lake. When Eddie and J.J. reach the bridge, Eddie angles the car to ride two tires on the railing and avoid the blown-out planks.When they enter a village and accidentally strike a goat in the road, the natives are angry and won't let them leave until Eddie passes them J.J.'s camera. Moving on, J.J. is annoyed and asks Eddie to respect what she does for a living as she does for him, and to ask the next time he decides to deprive her of $800 worth of equipment. Suddenly a baby baboon appears in the car. It seems to have gotten lost and wound up in their back seat. She refuses to throw him out, to Eddie's dismay: she says she is already riding with a big baboon, and they laugh at their situation as three baboons for the road. Borgia notes the presence of baboons on the road, and Feodor begins to construct a song from that idea. At the hotel checkpoint, only one room is left, so J.J. and Eddie have to share. She sneaks the baboon into the room, claims the bed and orders Eddie to shower before they go to dinner at the hotel restaurant. At the bar, Feodor plays his ""Baboons on the Road"" song on guitar for Borgia, and the count calls him a putz.Back on the road on a rainy start to day two of the race, the car becomes stuck in mud, and J.J. manages to get it out with Eddie pushing from the rear, but he also loses his balance and falls into the muck. When she tries to help, he pulls her down into the mud for laughing at him and the tension breaks: they kiss and eventually cool off together, nude, in a waterfall. Resuming the race, they encounter a massive bull elephant, and pass two teams whose cars got submerged during the rainstorm. A tire blows, and as Eddie changes it, J.J. goes off to take some pictures. As she runs back to avoid a moving herd of elephants, she gasps at Eddie that he has his back turned to a pride of lions. He slowly moves away and they get into the car with their new tire installed, and one lion makes off with the flat one as a toy.The count and Feodor discuss famous Borgias from the past who have traded on the name, such as ""Victor Borgia"" (Borge) and ""Ernest Borgia"" (Borgnine). At a crossroads the count orders Feodor to change a road sign showing the ways to the villages of Bomosa and Chipago. When they arrive at the sign, Eddie is not certain of J.J.'s map, so they follow the sign instead and find themselves in a village run by natives happy to get a fast buck from lost racers. A villager tosses a frozen chicken in front of the team's car so they drive over it, he then orders Eddie and J.J. to stand trial for hitting the bird. The "" judge"" sits on a ""bench"" constructed on an auto repair hydraulic lift, while burning torches and eerie organ music adds to the atmosphere. They have a choice of being fined $500 or they can elect to be cooked in a pot, but they are out of money. Eddie asks J.J.'s permission to hand over her second camera to pay the fine and they are set free.During an attempt to navigate to the checkpoint in the dark, all the remaining drivers appear to be lost in the dense fog. Nearby is a camp where Brigadier Hawthorne (Hugh Rouse) is regaling (or rather, boring) his wife Victoria (Mary Ann Berold) and hunter Stewart Simmons (Peter J. Elliott) with self-aggrandizing stale war stories. She pours coffee and whispers to Simmons that she simply must see him: later in his tent, he confesses that he is not the stereotypical bold hunter and has never been with a woman. She has already begun undressing herself and him. The brigadier continues his story, ignorant of the goings on until the cars arrive through the fog and take out the tent. Still, Victoria and Simmons grab sheets and manage to escape without her husband seeing them. At the checkpoint at last, J.J. and Eddie find that only Count Borgia has arrived before them. In the hotel room, they decide the race does not have to be the end of their relationship.The count bribes a tribe with $500 to attack Eddie and J.J., and Feodor supplies them with the car's number, but hands it to them upside down (it reads ""16"" in one direction and ""91"" in the other), so the natives see the number 16 car as the one to attack. As the final race day arrives, the tribe launches a massive assault and pelt Borgia's car with spears.

The elder prince comes to his rescue in time, and with the help of his three masters, the two eventually fight their way out of the array. Prince Two seeks his friend's help in eliminating Lord 9 and recovering the throne, but they arrive at the premier's quarters only to find the premier and others killed. Before his death, the premier identifies the elder prince from a royal seal carried by him. Outside the Shaolin Temple, Lord 9 orders the abbot to hand over the two princes when the two arrive. They accuse him of usurpation and kill him after a fierce fight. The throne is recovered, but the elder prince declines to return to Shaolin as a monk."

Matt returns home to his family, where he is faced with various issues before being shipped off to Vietnam. Source: Wikipedia (no source cited).. please someone update this!!.—Unknown source In the spring of 1968, Princeton University student Matt Caulfield and his three roommates celebrate President Lyndon Johnson's withdrawal from the presidential race with loud music and marijuana. A neighboring student lodges a noise complaint with the police and the four are expelled. Matt hitchhikes to his family home in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and finds his sister, Phoebe, alone in the house. While Phoebe is happy to see her brother, she warns that their parents, Margaret and Walter, are deeply upset by his expulsion. In the morning, Walter orders Matt to get a haircut and a job if he wants to continue living at home. Sometime later, Matt meets his girl friend, Kitty Armstrong, outside her high school. Although she greets him enthusiastically, Kitty is bewildered by his lack of concern over losing his scholarship. She also worries that his sudden disinterest in higher education could jeopardize their future together.They attend a screening of The Graduate, which Matt considers an allegory for his own life, while Kitty dismisses it as unrealistic. She invites him to a country club dance the following Saturday, but suggests he cut his hair to placate the more conservative members. Matt is offended and prefers to discuss the matter later in the week. Upon his return home, Matt learns that Senator Robert F. Kennedy has been shot by an assassin while campaigning for the presidency. When Matt arrives at the country club on Saturday evening, Kitty is with another escort. Matt is indignant, but Kitty reminds him that he never telephoned her. Angered and embarrassed, Matt wanders outside and encounters ""Jolly Jeff"" Maley, his former military academy classmate, sitting on a diving board at the country club pool. Matt compliments Jeff on considerable weight loss, which the latter attributes to amphetamines, among other recreational drugs. Jeff falls in the water and most of his drugs are ruined. He tells Matt he knows where another party is. They go over the speed limit and get chased by a cop on the way and when they veer out of the wrong lane,they actually cause the cop to go off the road. The cop is okay and they drive on.They go to a party at the home of their friend, Dwayne Billings, also known as ""Derek Savage,"" a popular late-night radio disc jockey, and almost get shot walking into a room with some big time drug dealers. Derek apologetically leads them out of the room.A young radical woman seduces Matt, then reveals herself to be Derek's live-in girl friend. When Matt arrives home the next morning, his family is leaving for church. Phoebe wishes he could give in a little,but it's too late anyway.Walter Caulfield orders him out of the house.Jeff solves Matt's problem by offering him a free room in a house he inherited from his late father. While attending a piano recital by her daughter, Phoebe, Margaret Caulfield encourages Matt to reconcile with the concerned Kitty, but he declines, believing they are no longer compatible. Walter is at his cabin fishing.Matt and Jeff play around that afternoon underneath the highway overpass,and Jeff nearly falls and hurts himself trying to get his falling drugs back.Jeff and Matt discuss how while they like free love, it's kind of taking the sport out of courtship since people no longer have to act like they're in love.Matt admits to Jeff that, while he rejects Kitty's conformist lifestyle, he feels equally unsuited to Derek Savage's open relationship, and wonders if a middle ground exists.Jeff replies the only middle ground is marriage,and neither one of them is ready for that.That evening, they find Phoebe sleeping outside their door.She borrowed their mother's car.She asks to move in with Matt since Walter has denied her the opportunity to attend the Juilliard School in New York City,which her tutor has set up.Matt said she can't stay with him because he can barely take care of himself. He drives his sister home, with the promise that he will personally take her to Juilliard if she can secure a scholarship.Their parents are upset,and Walter says he should have known she'd be with him, and he is dismissive of Matt,who says he should deal with his problems with Phoebe. He doesn't even want Matt in the house. Matt wanders the streets, and in the morning,Jeff picks him up by a phone booth, and recounts his own difficulties as a teenager, such his parents' divorce when his father walked out on his mother, his severe weight gain which actually came from his mother's gene pool,and his premature hair loss.However, Jeff's losing his virginity,and years of psychotherapy have taught him to stop blaming his parents for his troubles,and advises Matt to do the same.He also tells Matt to stop feeling guilty for not being the person his parents expect him to be.Later, an uncomfortable Margaret meets Matt for lunch at a diner full of hippie radicals.She scoffs over the largely vegetarian menu,and tells him that his father misses him, but is unable to accept how his son has changed.Matt admits he's changed but he doesn't know what he can do. He just doesn't want to deal with his father.
That evening, Jeff is despondent and overeating over losing his computer-engineering job, partly because they discovered his supposedly dead mother was still alive.Unfortunately, that job granted him a deferment from military service. He and Matt discuss methods to avoid being drafted,as both are 1A and therefore eligible,but neither can agree on a solution.Jeff says with Matt's ROTC and his military background already they could get a promotion, but Matt says 4 years of that crap was enough.Jeff suggests going to Canada, but Matt says they may never be able to come back and it's too cold. Jeff suggests prison.""At least we know when we're getting out, after a friendly g******** or two!"" Mask scoffs at that but suggest they could become priests.""We'd get a free education and when it came time to take our vows we could say we changed our minds.""Jeff replies he isn't catholic. Matt says just convert.Jeff shrugs.They attend the screening of a film depicting the bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945. While Jeff attempts to seduce a young woman who is saddened by the images, Bill, the host, reveals that the bombing of North Vietnam has caused much greater devastation, and people are fighting for nothing more than their own self-determination over there.Derek is at the screening too. Matt asks how he beat the draft,and Derek replies he faked being crippled. Derek makes out with a girl in his DJ office while he's introducing a song on the air,, and Matt is the other room making out with another girl who rambles on about how all we're really doing is going on with the flow latching on occasionally some to some brief security, like her unemployment checks.Jeff is in the next room with a young woman from the screening, ready to party.
In August, Matt and Jeff sit in a bar and watch television news footage of riots outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.The young folks in the bar curse the cops.Despite police brutality toward anti-war demonstrators, Matt regrets not attending. Upon receiving his draft notice,Jeff stairs wistfully at his high school in the rain, until Matt gets him back in the car. He takes Matt's advice and requests a letter from his psychiatrist, stating that he is mentally unfit.The psychiatrist writes a fraudulent letter, as he has for numerous other reluctant draftees, saying Jeff is depressed, chemically dependent, impotent, and falls to pieces in the face of aggression.Jeff is ordered to report for examination the next morning. He acts clumsy and disoriented even bumping into a wall,but they laugh at his phony letter and Jeff is officially drafted.He is told to report for induction the following morning.That evening,at a bowling alley,Jeff encounters his former girl friend, Lori, who is saddened by the news and gives him a tearful goodbye,despite the fact that she's dating someone else.He and Matt enter the adjacent barroom, where they are harassed by a group of rednecks who threaten to shear Matt's head. Jeff and Matt get into a brawl with them,and run for the parking lot with the gang in pursuit. They run across the bowling alley and out the back way, throwing pins to slow their pursuers down.They make it outside but are cornered and attacked.Jeff is hit in the stomach,causing him to cough blood. The thugs run and drive off as police arrive, while Matt tries to comfort Jeff.They sit behind their car to hide from the police until Jeff recovers and he admits to Matt that he's really scared. He couldn't even shower and go to the bathroom with strangers when he was at the Academy. He always went home smelling. Still coughing up some blood he sobs in Matt's arms afraid he's not going to make it.Matt says he'll make it.In the morning, as Jeff leaves for boot camp on the bus with the other recruits,Matt gets out of the car,runs up to the bus,and as it pulls off,he runs by the overjoyed Jeff's window and promises to join him in the next few days.
That evening, Matt visits his parents' home with his hair clipped short away,(the disbelieving barber did it for free),explaining to his dad in the garage that he has enlisted in the Army and is leaving in a couple of days.Walter just mutters good luck and admonishes Matt,saying he could have avoided combat duty by enlisting as an officer,or in the reserves,but instead he should be in Vietnam in about 6 weeks and he's a damn idiot.Matt says he just wanted to get it over with.Walter says he has no idea what he's getting himself into.Margaret isn't home but Phoebe is.When he goes inside and tells her,Phoebe angrily reminds her brother of his promise to take her to Juilliard.Matt says Jeff needs him and he can't do it alone.
Matt sits outside the airport the next day in his car.He returns to his place to find Phoebe outside again.She says Jeff's mother called.Jeff died of a heart attack his first day in boot camp.Matt drives to Derek's radio station that night and tells him. Derek somberly stops playing Cream's ""I Feel Free""and puts on Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth."" ""This is for Jolly Jeff from two old friends.Happy trails.""
After the funeral,which is,ironically,a military one,Matt sees his family has attended He says he's going to be staying with Jeff's mother until he leaves,and he gives Phoebe the keys to his car so she can drive herself to Juilliard.He gets in the hearse with Jeff's mother, this is the funeral was very nice although ""Jeffrey would have hated it.""She doesn't understand how Matt could say his death was a waste, but Matt replies Jeff would be the first to agree with him.She remarks at how bitter Matt is,and he can't believe she isn't bitter but she says she's just sad and lonely. She asked if Matt believe in God.He doesn't know but she believes everything God does is part of His plan, even if we can't understand it
On the day of Matt's induction,a Sergeant coldly instructs the recruits in the recruiting office as they are all officially inducted into the army and take the oath of office.The recruits all say goodbye to their families.Walter expresses his pride,while Margaret hugs Matt goodbye and apologizes for Phoebe's absence,but saying she sends her love,unaware that she is watching from across the street in his car.Matt sees her as he gets on the bus for boot camp.The group departs on the bus for boot camp.After they've driven awhile,the young officer sergeant in charge berates one of the recruits for listening to music,and throws his headphones out the window, then he goes back to the front of the bus.Matt is filled with growing despair, finally,he removes his belt, walks to the front of the bus,and tightens it around the bus driver's neck,then renders the officer sergeant unconscious with a kick to the head.He forces the driver to pull over,then he opens the doors,and runs from the bus as the other passengers cheer and applaud. The bus has pulled over on a bridge overpass above a river,and he runs down the overpass,past a few backed up cars,then he leaps off the overpass at the front,and runs into the woods by the river. He runs away into the fields and we hear Jimi Hendrix playing The Star Spangled Banner.and the film ends."

It was not a good title: it seems that Andrés Vicente Gómez got mad. There are runs and there is joy, but it was infinitely better than Gonzalo and Javier had put him: On the fly. Premise: a trilero without luck (Javier GP) and a guy who has just escaped from jail (Miguel Ángel Iglesias) to burn all the clubs of the gangster that sent him to the maco, become the sevillian Sevillians of Kerouac and Dean Moriarty, They pick up a jaranera lady (Isabel Pisano) and they throw themselves to the road ready to have a blast.

And what they are finding exceeds any forecast of the viewer.A cursed title - which in its time was relegated to the specialized cinemas ""S"" - which is a real joy for the few chosen who have been able to taste it and have incorporated it into their private cults. In the style of the more traditional ""road movie"", he proposes a journey through a colorful but scarcely topical Andalusia by two born losers with a mission to fulfill. Delirious dialogues and the naturalness with which he develops an almost impossible story turn it into an unrepeatable rarity.In conclusion, Miguel, escaped from prison two months after serving his sentence, only thinks about revenge and finding his beloved Diana. Leaving to Javier, a talkative trilero with a cabriolet-coffee machine, on a trip through Andalusia after the trail of the missing maid. Along the way, a string of unclassifiable encounters and characters to each one more crazy"

Big Shots,1982,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084342/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four men whose combined intellect does not reach into the triple digits decide to steal a safe full of foreign currency - not from a local bank, but from the police station. Based on a real-life incident, the screenplay for this slapstick comedy-drama was co-written by a policeman, also a play-writer, Haim Merin, lending a certain voice of authority to the setting, and the director, Jacob Goldwasser. The comedic high point of the film is when the four thieves bumble and bang their way through the police station, while the policeman on guard duty slumbers on in blissful ignorance. The thieves may be running on more muscle than Gery matter, more chemicals than Dow, and more luck than forethought, but they pull off the supposedly impossible robbery. From that point onward though, luck dwindles away as their greed surpasses their grasp of how to follow up on their success.—Ron Ackerman"
