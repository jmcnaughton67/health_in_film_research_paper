Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a new threat to the galaxy rises, Rey, a desert scavenger, and Finn, an ex-stormtrooper, must join Han Solo and Chewbacca to search for the one hope of restoring peace. 30 years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Empire, Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku, finds a BB-8 droid that knows the whereabouts of the long lost Luke Skywalker. Rey, as well as a rogue stormtrooper and two smugglers, are thrown into the middle of a battle between the Resistance and the daunting legions of the First Order.—Noah White A scavenger (Daisy Ridley) and a renegade stormtrooper (John Boyega) enlist the help of legendary smugglers/freedom fighters Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to transport a droid carrying information regarding the whereabouts of long lost Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to General Leia Organa of the Resistance before it falls into the hands of Kylo Ren and the First Order. When critical information is placed into a simple droid, both the evil First Order and the heroic Resistance go searching for it. Then something neither of them planned for happens: Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku finds the droid and keeps it as her own. Finn, an ex-stormtrooper who hopes to leave his past behind him, crosses paths with her and breaks the news of what exactly the importance of the droid is. Next thing either of them know is that they are on the run in order to withhold the droid from the First Order. They meet a pair of old buddies and after a few skirmishes between them and the determined First Order, the droid is brought to the Resistance base. There, multiple plans are hatched against the First Order while the secret information on the droid is slowly and surely working itself out... 30 years ago the Empire was defeated and now a new threat, the First Order has risen from the ashes of the Empire. A scavenger called Rey has come into contact with a droid that contains a map to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who has vanished. Rey and a rogue stormtrooper called Finn find themselves in a monumental conflict between good and evil, that will see faces old and new. Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts.The First Order, led by the evil Kylo Ren, is landing stormtroopers to attack a small village, as Poe Dameron meets with Lor San Tekka in a hut. He is given a small bag containing the map to Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren orders the stormtroopers to destroy Lor San Tekka's entire village and takes Poe captive. Captain Phasma, a stormtrooper wearing chrome-plated armor, leads the attack. Poe's X-Wing is damaged so that he cannot escape, so the pilot puts the map in a rolling droid unit called BB-8. To cover BB-8's escape, Dameron guns down a stormtrooper, and the trooper's comrade, FN-2187, stops to check his wounds. The dying stormtrooper reaches up and drags his bloody hand across his companion's helmet, leaving blood streaks behind. FN-2187 then wakes up to the chaos of the battle around him. Kylo Ren then walks onto the battleground and interrogates Lor San Tekka. When Tekka doesn't give up the map's whereabouts, Ren pulls out his lightsaber and kills him. Trying to avenge Tekka's death, Dameron fires at Kylo Ren, who uses the Force on the blaster bolt, suspending it in midair. Troopers bring him to Ren, who orders to search him. Finding nothing, Dameron is taken prisoner on a troop transport. As Dameron is captured, the troopers massacre the remaining prisoners, but FN-2187 refuses to fire. Meanwhile, BB-8 rolls away across the sands, narrowly escaping capture.The droid runs into Rey, a young scavenger who is barely surviving on Jakku. Rey scavenges parts from old wrecks of Star Destroyers on the sands of Jakku and exchanges them for food at Unkar Plutt's scrap yard. The marks on the walls of her hut indicate she's been on Jakku for a very long time. She rescues BB-8 from Teedo, another scavenger. She understands BB's plight, and reluctantly offers him shelter for the night.On the First Order destroyer, Poe is unsuccessfully interrogated by the First Order. Kylo Ren is called in to use his Force powers to extract information from Poe about the whereabouts of the map. Poe resists, but ultimately divulges that the map is still on Jakku in his BB-8 unit.Meanwhile Captain Phasma confronts FN-2187 about his behavior on Jakku. She orders him to take his unused blaster in for inspection and report to her division and ultimately reconditioning. Instead, FN-2187 makes the decision to defect and run away. He needs a pilot to escape the star destroyer, so he covertly rescues Poe, and the two board a black First Order TIE fighter and escape. Poe renames FN-2187 as Finn, and expertly pilots to an escape while Finn fires the ship's blasters. Poe directs the ship back down to Jakku, which Finn protests, saying they'll die if they go back. Poe explains that they're going back for his droid, who contains a map to Luke Skywalker. Seconds later, the fighter is hit by lasers from the destroyer and crash lands on Jakku. Finn has ejected, but it appears Poe has gone down with the ship in the sinking fields, leaving only his jacket.Finn wanders across the desert discarding his stormtrooper armor. Eventually, he arrives in Niima Outpost, the town where Rey trades scrap for food. While Finn is looking for water in the town, he sees Rey being attacked by two of Unkar Plutt's henchmen who are trying to make off with BB-8. He begins to rush to her aid, but before he gets far, Rey handily fights off her attackers using her staff. Clearly, she can handle herself. BB-8 spots Finn looking their way and tells Rey that he is wearing Poe's jacket, which they assume is stolen. Rey chases Finn down, knocks him to the ground and confronts Finn about the jacket. BB-8 assists by giving Finn electric shocks. Finn tells them that Poe was captured by the First Order and that he helped him escape, but Poe was unfortunately killed. BB-8 is saddened and rolls off, but Rey is excited and impressed, and assumes Finn is a resistance fighter. Finn lies, telling her he is indeed with the resistance. Rey excitedly tells Finn that BB-8 is on a secret mission. Finn tells her BB-8 is carrying a map to Luke Skywalker and Rey is astonished, declaring that she thought Skywalker was a myth.BB-8 returns and alerts Finn and Rey that they are in trouble. First Order stormtroopers are now looking for Finn and the BB-8 droid. Stormtroopers chase Finn, Rey and BB-8 through Niima Outpost and TIE fighters are called in and begin to bomb and strafe the town. To make their escape, they steal a ""garbage"" vehicle to escape the First Order. It is the Millennium Falcon. Rey takes the pilot's seat while Finn mans the guns. Neither is confident in their abilities, and their lift off is rough, destroying a substantial portion of the town as they try to get off of the ground. Finn is able to shoot down a pursuing fighter, but the guns are hit and locked in a position that prevents him from taking out the remaining fighter. Rey flies through the wrecked ships in the desert of Jakku, occasionally scraping through the sands as they try to keep low to confuse the TIE fighter's tracking. Rey takes the Falcon into one of the Star Destroyers and just as the pursuing fighter locks onto their ship, she turns the Falcon out into the open, and performs a flip which allows Finn to fire successfully at the remaining fighter, taking it down. They head off, away from Jakku, and on toward the wider galaxy. Not having flown in years, the Falcon is not in good repair, and almost immediately requires an emergency patch. Rey begins repairing the ship while Finn admits to BB-8 he is not part of the resistance, but is still able to convince BB-8 to tell them where the Resistance base is.The Falcon is then captured and pulled into a larger ship. Finn is afraid they have been recaptured by the First Order. As the Falcon is boarded, he and Rey hide in a secret compartment, trying to set off a poisonous gas that will kill the stormtroopers, but the boarding party is actually Han Solo and Chewbacca.Rey knows the history of the ship, and how to repair and fly it. Han is impressed, but the ship is then boarded by two more smuggler parties. Han is trying his hand at smuggling again, this time by carrying some menacing Rathtars. Han tries to talk his way out of his debts with the two smuggling groups while Rey and Finn escape. Rey tries to close blast doors to save Han, but instead opens the doors to the Rathtar containers. The Rathtars attack and eat the smugglers and almost get Finn, but Rey saves him by closing a door on the creature's tentacles, severing them. The heroes escape in the Millennium Falcon and leave their attackers behind. The new-found allies travel to the green planet of Takodana to seek help from Maz Kanata, a short, orange skinned alien. There they are spotted in the cantina by both First Order and Resistance spies. Kylo Ren sends forces to re-capture the map. Finn, still fearful of being recaptured by the First Order, admits that he is not part of the Resistance and decides to run by joining a crew heading for the outer rim.Meanwhile Rey is drawn to the lower floor of the cantina by the sound of a girl crying and opens a box to discover Luke Skywalkers lightsaber lost at Cloud City. When she touches the lightsaber, she experiences a frightening vision. The dream has the voices of old Jedi like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. It flashes by quickly. She sees the hallways of Cloud City, a vision of Skywalker and R2-D2, a vision of Kylo Ren surrounded by bodies, thrusting his saber through the chest of a mysterious figure, a vision of herself being abandoned as a child on Jakku and finally she sees Ren pursing her in a snowy forest. Maz explains that the lightsaber was Luke's and now it calls to Rey. Still panicked, Rey refuses the lightsaber and dashes out of Maz's palace.On Starkiller Base, a snowy, mountainous planet, General Hux addresses legions of First Order stormtroopers. He angrily declares the death of the Republic. The planet has a massive trench around the equator, and a continent-sized aperture. The base fires a massive red beam from the center of the planet, traveling across space, and splitting into four separate beams which destroy individual planets. We see crowds of people on populated planets look up into the sky to witness the conflagration as their planet is destroyed.Finn and the others look to the sky as the red beams can be seen destroying the other Republic planets. The First Order begin landing troops, including Kylo Ren's V-winged ship. Maz gives the lightsaber to Finn. As the stormtroopers attack Finn uses the lightsaber to fight back, but is knocked down by another stormtrooper (unnamed, but popularly referred to as TR-8R). The stormtroopers capture Han, Chewbacca and Finn.Rey tries to use the blaster given to her by Han Solo, but inexperienced and frightened she fumbles with the safety and fires a wild shot that gives away her position. However, she does manage to hit several stormtroopers, which surprises her. Overwhelmed she runs deeper into the forest. BB-8 follows, and she tells him to go further on while she tries to fight off their pursuers. Kylo Ren tracks down Rey in the woods. He chases her through the forest easily fending off her desperate attempts to fire on him with the blaster. She backs away, but he stops her, using the Force to hold her still. Ren uses the Force to read her mind and discovers that she has seen the map to Luke Skywalker's location. He decides he no longer needs BB-8, so he knocks her out and carries her off in his ship, as Finn watches.The Resistance X-wing fighters arrive, finishing off the last troops. A troop ship lands carrying General Leia Organa and C-3P0. Han and Leia are reunited, but their relations are tense. It is revealed that Kylo Ren is actually their son. The heroes return to the Resistance Base, where Finn is reunited with Poe Dameron, who was not killed by the crash on Jakku, but instead was thrown from the crash when it hit. When Poe notices that Finn is wearing his jacket, he tells him to keep it. BB-8 is reunited with R2-D2 and C-3P0, but R2-D2 has been in shut down since Luke left many years before. The Resistance fighters begin to plan an attack on the Starkiller Base to avoid being wiped out. It is shown that the Base feeds on suns for power, absorbing its energy to power the laser. Finn wants to rescue Rey, and claims he once worked at Starkiller Base and knows how to knock out the shields. Han and Leia say their goodbyes as the X-wings led by Poe Dameron prepare to attack a weak point, a thermal oscillator, on the base. As they part, Leia asks Han to bring their son home if he sees him.On Starkiller Base, Rey wakes to find herself locked in an interrogation chair like the one we have seen earlier in Poe's interrogation scene. She and Kylo Ren converse, and he removes his mask, revealing his face to her; he is a young and handsome man. Ren uses the Force to read Rey's mind. He senses her lonely life on Jakku, her dreams of a faraway island and the closeness she feels towards Han Solo. She reacts with hostility but seems unable to keep him from reading her thoughts. When he tries to extract the information about the map from her mind, however, he runs up against an unexpected barrier. Rey is not only able to resist his further probing, but pushes back into Ren's mind, and tells him that he is afraid that he will never be as strong as Darth Vader. Ren is shaken by this and by her obvious strength with the Force, and he runs away to meet with Snoke in search of guidance on how to proceed. Kylo Ren and General Hux are scolded for not retrieving the droid, and Ren's inability to crack Rey's mind, by the Supreme Leader, who is only revealed as a massive hologram of an old and scarred man seated on a throne towering over them.Rey now understands that she has some Force talent and uses a mind-trick to escape from the stormtrooper guarding her cell. She sneaks through the Starkiller Base to the hanger to escape. Meanwhile, Han and Chewie come out of hyperspace dangerously close to the planet in order to evade the shields, and crash land in the snowy forest. Finn reveals he does not know how to disable the shields; he only came back to rescue Rey. They quietly capture Captain Phasma and force her to lower the shields. Finn, Han and Chewbacca head off to find Rey, but quickly discover that she has freed herself when they spot her scaling a wall of the base. They rush to meet her. She is surprised that they would come back for her and embraces Finn when she learns from Chewbacca that it was Finn's idea that they come to the base to save her.Poe and the X-Wing fighters arrive and begin to land torpedoes on the oscillator, but it holds against the barrage. They need to knock it out before it drains the sun and is ready to fire. Han and Chewbacca improvise a plan to plant explosives to blow it up instead. They split up to lay explosives in separate locations. Kylo Ren finds that Rey has escaped and angrily slashes the cell with his lightsaber. He searches the base for Rey. He stalks off onto a catwalk where Han spots him. Han approaches him on the catwalk, calling him Ben. He asks his son to return with him, and Ren offers his lightsaber, but then activates it and kills his father, pushing him off into the pit. Chewbacca, having watched the entire conversation, fires on Ren, hitting him in the side, and then detonates the explosives.Kylo Ren confronts Finn and Rey in the snowy forest. Ren is bleeding from his wound, but still ignites his red fiery saber to fight. Rey raises her blaster to fire on Ren, but he throws her against a tree with a Force push and she lies unconscious in the snow. Finn rushes to her aid and then uses the blue lightsaber to fight Ren. Finn quickly finds himself outmatched. He manages to glance Ren with the saber, but this only enrages him. Rey is revived by the sound of Finn's screams as he is burned by Ren's saber. Ren easily disarms Finn, tossing the saber off into the snow, after which, he slices Finn in the back, knocking him unconscious. He then uses the Force to pull the lightsaber to himself. It hurtles towards him but then flies past. Ren turns to discover the saber in Rey's hands. Rey is as astonished as Ren is. They begin to fight. Rey initially fights unsuccessfully and desperately and begins to run from Ren. He pursues her and pins her against the edge of a cliff. Ren offers to teach her the Force, but this only ends up reminding her to tap into its power. She closes her eyes for a moment of meditation and then attacks Ren with a new vigor and power. She rapidly gains the upper hand, extinguishes Ren's saber and slashes him on the arm and across the face.Meanwhile Poe Dameron and the X-Wing pilots fly into the Star Killer base trench, destroying the rest of the base. The planet begins to collapse and explode. A chasm opens between Ren and Rey as the planet continues to fall apart. Chewbacca arrives in the Millennium Falcon to pick up both Finn and Rey. The Falcon and X-Wings escape as the Starkiller Base explodes. Back at the Resistance base, Leia and Rey embrace in sadness, standing apart from the celebration of the rest of the Resistance base.Back at the Resistance Base, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the missing part of the map to Lukes location. Finn is still unconscious, and Rey tells him goodbye while he rests. Rey and Chewbacca leave in the Falcon, Rey taking the pilot's seat. They fly to the planet indicated by the map, Ach-To, where Rey carefully climbs a rocky island. When she reaches the top, she finds an old cloaked and bearded Jedi with a metal hand. It is Luke Skywalker. Rey wordlessly offers him the lightsaber."
Jurassic World,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree. Twenty-two years after the original Jurassic Park failed, the new park, also known as Jurassic World, is open for business. After years of studying genetics, the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus rex. When everything goes horribly wrong, will our heroes make it off the island?—ahmetkozan Jurassic World has been running with great success for more than a decade in the wake of the disaster that haunted the island twenty-two years ago. The park's geneticists have once again broken scientific and ethical boundaries in order to raise attendance for the park, now experiencing a decline in happy customers. Convinced that the new attraction will bring in many more people, but having crossed the line once again, the results may be devastating.—Ed Morales Twenty-two years after John Hammond envisioned a theme park full of dinosaurs, Jurassic World in Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. Although it is everything he originally hoped it would be, after ten years of operation and visitor rates declining, InGen scientists genetically engineer a new hybrid ""attraction"", the Indominus rex, to re-spark visitors' interest. When their new creation turns on them, will anyone get out alive?—Mario Saltalamacchia The new Jurassic World, owned by the corporation of Simon Masrani operates in Isla Nublar, Central America, with dinosaurs genetically created by the InGen Corporation. The workaholic and uptight manager Claire Dearing receives her nephews Gray and Zach in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them, and asks her assistant to escort the boys. Meanwhile, the dedicated Owen Grady is training four velociraptors, and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins believes that the animal can be trained for military use. When Owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur Indominus rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men, and flees from the spot. Owen escapes and asks Masrani to kill the Indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. However, the team is destroyed by the Indominus rex and Claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. But the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. Meanwhile, Gray and Zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and Claire and Owen seek them out. With the chaos on the island, Vic assumes command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the Indominus rex. Will his plan work?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray Mitchell (Ty Simpkins) visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park on Isla Nublar, of which their aunt Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath) as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own.Elsewhere on the island, former Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) has been training a quartet of Velociraptors composed of Blue, Delta, Echo, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of InGen security Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry (Omar Sy) vehemently oppose.Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) inspect the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, a transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong). Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the Indominus lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the Indominus has apparently escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Realizing that it is highly vicious and intelligent, Owen advises Masrani to have the Indominus destroyed but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector, while Masrani ponders Owen's warning and confronts Wu.While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the vehicle but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old Jeep Wrangler, and drive back to the park resort.As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the Indominus as well. Masrani and two troopers hunt down the Indominus by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary. The aviary's pterosaurs crash Masrani's helicopter, killing its passengers, before converging onto the resort, and attacking everyone, including Zara who is then devoured by a Mosasaurus. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs.Assuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the Indominus, where Owen reluctantly complies and spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding the Indominus, the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the Indominus has Velociraptor DNA and it takes away Owen's command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new alpha. Troops fire on the Indominus, but it escapes. The raptors kill most of the troops, while Charlie is killed in the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him.Owen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the Indominus reappears. They attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the park's veteran attraction, from its paddock and lures it into a battle with the Indominus. The Indominus quickly gains the advantage over the Tyrannosaurus until Blue recovers and joins the battle. The duo overpower the Indominus until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the Mosasaurus.The survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned once again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together. Back on the now-abandoned Isla Nublar, the Tyrannosaurus goes up to the helicopter landing pad and roars in victory, reestablishing her dominance as Queen of the Island."
Avengers: Age of Ultron,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program called Ultron, things go horribly wrong and it's up to Earth's mightiest heroes to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plan. Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peacekeeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy together. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction.—applenatalia9 After finding intelligence in Loki's scepter, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use it to start Ultron, a peacemaker, who soon uncovers the world's wrongs, and plans to rid human error. With help from experimented human beings turned allies, the Avengers search to hunt for Ultron, who is trying to make a synthetic human body to upload his mind into.—sheldonandres The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki's scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff, who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron decides that is necessary to annihilate mankind in order to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After a successful raid on a HYDRA base, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an Artificial Intelligence called Ultron, a peacekeeping protocol designed to help the Avengers protect the world from their enemies. But things go wrong when Ultron sees the human race as a threat and sets out to destroy it along with the Avengers. Now the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, must reassemble to stop Ultron from causing mass destruction. Aside from this, the Avengers also must take on the powerful twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as well as the new entity called Vision. Also, the Avengers find that things may never be the same again after discovering a power beyond their comprehension. In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers - Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner / Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton / Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) - raid a Hydra outpost commanded by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.As the team are fighting their way past the guards around the base's perimeter, they run into a pair of twin siblings who are Strucker's only successful experiments: Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), a young woman who possesses powers of telekinesis, telepathy, and mental manipulation, and her brother Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed. Pietro rushes outside and joins the battle with the incoming Avengers. Clint is wounded when he's grazed in the side by a blast from a gun nest due to Pietro distracting him, forcing Natasha to abandon the fight to tend to him.While Thor evacuates Clint from the battlefield and Natasha uses a lullaby to help the Hulk revert to Bruce, Tony and Steve manage to penetrate the fortress. Steve captures Strucker as he is preparing to flee. Strucker monologues for a bit, long enough for Wanda to sneak up and let loose a telekinetic blast to knock Steve down some stairs. By the time he gets back up to knock Strucker out with his shield, Wanda has disappeared.Meanwhile, Tony kills Dr. List, Strucker's top underling, as he's trying to delete files on their work. While Tony has JARVIS download the data for preservation, he finds a secret laboratory underneath the fortress in which Strucker's people have been taking a Leviathan apart, and the scepter, sitting in plain sight. As Tony walks up to the scepter, he doesn't notice that Wanda has followed him into the lab. As he's about to grab the scepter, she walks up behind him and casts a spell on him, implanting a vision into his mind. Tony sees his teammates in front of him either dead or dying, and Steve saying he could've done more to save them, while the Chitauri launch an even larger invasion of Earth. After a few moments, he snaps out of the vision and realizes it was all a dream. Pietro makes it downstairs and is confused by the fact his sister is just letting Tony walk away. Wanda says nothing but grins as Tony summons part of his armor and grabs the scepter.With Strucker now in NATO custody, HYDRA has suffered a great blow and the organization is left in a state of discord. Returning to Avengers Tower in New York with the scepter, Tony and Bruce begin studying the weapon, having convinced Thor to wait a few days before he takes it back to Asgard. Their research leads to the discovery of a net of neurons that Tony realizes could be reconfigured into an artificial intelligence stored inside the scepter's gem. The two scientists extract it for use in Ultron, a peacekeeping program that Tony has designed to allow his Iron Legion to operate independently and safeguard Earth under the direction of a more advanced A.I. than JARVIS (voiced byPaul Bettany).After three days, the project is seemingly met with little success. However, as the Avengers are throwing a party in the penthouse to celebrate capturing the scepter, Ultron (James Spader) suddenly activates. Somehow already self-aware despite Tony's work not having made it that far ahead, Ultron browses the Internet and immediately determines that the only way to save Earth is to eradicate humanity, which he deems as the prime factor in the world's turmoils. JARVIS tries to reason with Ultron, but the more powerful A.I. appears to destroy him and, feeling he needs a body, he downloads himself into the Iron Legion armors. Towards the end of the Avengers' party, the team, joined by Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and geneticist Helen Cho (Claudia Kim)(who tended to Clint's injuries) hold a small contest to see who can lift Mjølnir.Their contest is interrupted when Ultron attacks them using the Iron Legion drones. One of them almost kills Cho, but mysteriously decides to spare her life. All of the Iron Legion drones are eventually dispatched, except for one which flees to Sokovia with the scepter and takes up shop in Strucker's old HYDRA base. There, Ultron uses the HYDRA technology stored there to begin construction of an army of robotic drones, as well as build himself a new proper body.As the other Avengers confront Tony about his secrecy, Ultron seeks out the Maximoff twins. He intends to use them, and Wanda's powers specifically, to drive a wedge between the Avengers. This is something the twins are on-board with, as they have a vendetta against the Avengers, especially Tony, as missiles built by his company killed their parents in a bombing in 1999. To that end, Wanda had willingly allowed Tony to make off with the scepter with hopes that his fear of letting the world die would lead to him constructing his own undoing, which in this case appears to be Ultron.Ultron, with the twins and an army of drones at his side, hits up several former HYDRA bases for resources, killing anyone who resists while using Wanda to neutralize everyone else. Word of what he's doing gets back to the Avengers when he kills Strucker in his cell, writing the word ""PEACE"" on the wall in Strucker's blood. Through some detective work, the team determines that Ultron wants to buy vibranium from an arms dealer named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). They set off for the South African coast, where Klaue is known to have a base of operations.Ultron and the Maximoffs infiltrate Klaue's ship, with the twins entering first to strong-arm Klaue. Klaue is not fazed by the twins' efforts to intimidate him, brings up Strucker's death, and demands to speak to their new employer, prompting Ultron to reveal himself. Ultron wires a 10-figure sum of money to Klaue's various offshore bank accounts in exchange for the entire vibranium stockpile. But the transaction goes awry at that point when Klaue recognizes a phrase Ultron uses as something Tony used to say to him a long time ago, prompting Ultron to cut off Klaue's left arm in a moment of rage.Moments later, the Avengers (save for Bruce, who stays with the quinjet) arrive. Ultron engages Tony while leaving the others to fend off the twins, Ultron's sentry drones, and Klaue's henchmen. The fight ends up being a loss for the Avengers, as Wanda ends up taking out Thor, Steve, and Natasha by giving them vivid hallucinations that render them catatonic. Thor finds himself in a hellish party in Asgard, where a blinded Heimdall gleefully claims that they are all dead in a very disturbing way. Natasha has flashbacks to her training in the Red Room and relives having to execute a bound and blindfolded person as well as undergo surgery that left her sterile. Steve imagines seeing Peggy Carter again at a party where she asks him to dance and celebrate that the war is over. The only one to avoid being brainwashed is Clint, who shoots Wanda with an arrow that sticks to her forehead and shocks her, forcing her to retreat with Pietro.Pietro gets Wanda off the ship. Wanda is undeterred by the setback, and noticing Bruce alone in the Avengers' quinjet, she uses her powers on him. Whatever vision she gave Bruce, he turns into the Hulk, makes his way to Johannesburg, and begins causing mayhem. After blowing up Ultron's current body, Tony flies to Johannesburg and calls in ""Veronica,"" a custom armor designed to encase his current armor and which is designed to subdue the Hulk. After a lengthy fight, the Hulk is finally brought down, but not before several buildings are destroyed. The resulting public backlash forces the team to go into hiding.The team takes refuge with Clint's family in central Iowa, where they meet his pregnant wife Laura, son Cooper and daughter Lila. Thor temporarily leaves, traveling to the mystical ""Water of Sights"" with Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) to determine the meaning of his hallucination. Natasha and Bruce make plans to run away and start a new life together when Ultron is defeated. They are encouraged to mend fences by the arrival of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who convinces them to form a plan to stop Ultron. Noting Ultron's fondness for the human body despite its limitations, Bruce realizes Ultron plans to use the vibranium to build himself a new body made out of synthetic tissue, like that which Cho used to heal Clint's most recent injuries.Tony becomes intrigued when Fury notes that Ultron hasn't managed to access any nation's nuclear launch codes. It's clear Ultron has an unseen enemy who is keeping him at bay. To find out who this is, Tony travels to a Nexus internet hub in Oslo, Norway for leads, and comes to the realization that Ultron's engaging with JARVIS, who is still alive and well.Ultron makes his way to Cho's laboratory in Seoul, South Korea, and demands that she use the vibranium in conjunction with synthetic tissue from her regeneration cradle to create a more powerful body for himself, with the scepter's gem as its primary power source. To ensure her cooperation, Ultron uses the scepter to brainwash Cho.As Ultron transfers his consciousness into the synthetic body and Cho implants the gem into its forehead, Wanda becomes curious, realizing that she will now be able to read Ultron's thoughts. She touches the cradle, and immediately screams in horror when she sees an image of an asteroid hitting the Earth, indicative of his real plans to destroy humanity. Realizing that Ultron used them, Wanda snaps Cho out from the scepter's influence to disrupt the transfer process and flees with Pietro. Realizing what's happened, Ultron wounds Cho and kills her assistants, before he and his sentries leave with the regeneration cradle in tow, planning to take it back to Sokovia.As Ultron and his drones are making their way across town in a semi-truck, Steve and Natasha intercept them, with Clint providing air support from the quinjet. Steve engages Ultron in a fight atop the truck, while Natasha manages to get into the trailer, and Clint provides assistance from the quinjet. The fight eventually takes them into a moving train, while Ultron's sentries attach themselves to the truck's trailer and lift it skyward. Onboard the train, Ultron gains the upper hand on Steve, and begins beating him up. He is stopped when Pietro suddenly bowls through the train and collides with his torso, knocking him down, and Wanda twists two of the luggage racks to form an improvised barricade. Undeterred, Ultron fires a uni-beam blast in Pietro's direction, killing the train's driver, then takes off in pursuit of the flying trailer. Natasha plants explosives in the trailer to destroy it and transfers the cradle to the quinjet, but is snatched by Ultron. Meanwhile, the runaway train crashes through a bumper block and careens out of control through the streets. After a moment of persuasion from Steve, the twins leap into action. Pietro jumps off and runs ahead to clear pedestrians out of the way while Wanda applies a concentrated burst of telekinetic energy to brake the train to a stop. As they compose themselves, Wanda is dismayed when Steve mentions that the cradle is on its way to Tony, and points out, ""Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?"" -- a comment that concerns Steve.Ultron takes Natasha back to Strucker's old fortress and throws her in a cell, seeking to show off while he uses the vibranium to construct his next and most durable body. Unbeknownst to him, she manages to access some communication equipment, allowing her to send a message to Clint on her location. Meanwhile, in New York, Tony and Banner discover that JARVIS in fact wasn't killed when Ultron attacked him; he actually went underground and has been keeping Ultron from accessing any nation's military codes. Since JARVIS has always been a benevolent AI, Tony thinks that their best chance is to use him to power the new body.They have almost completed the process when Steve arrives with the Maximoff twins, demanding they shut it down. A fight breaks out, which is resolved when Thor arrives, summons lightning with Mjolnir, and directs it into the cradle. Moments later, the body inside the cradle bursts out, revealing itself to be a 6'4"" metal man (played byPaul Bettany), who they take to referring to as 'Vision'. Wanda is instantly smitten with Vision and even attempts to flirt with him, while Thor explains that the gem in the scepter (and which now rests in Vision's forehead) is the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, which Thor saw in his hallucination, and its power could be advantageous against Ultron. Vision quickly establishes that he is trustworthy by effortlessly lifting Mjolnir.Tony, Steve, Clint, Bruce, Wanda, Pietro, and Vision return to Sokovia, where Ultron has used whatever vibranium wasn't used to build Vision's body or his latest form, and combined it with Chitauri anti-gravity technologies that Strucker was studying to build an anti-gravity drill underneath the church where he first met the Maximoff twins in order to lift a large part of Novi Grad into the sky. His intent is to crash it into the ground to replicate a meteor strike, causing a mass extinction event. While Bruce frees Natasha, the Avengers begin evacuating civilians from the city and engaging Ultron's army of robots. The heroes get a brief reprieve as Vision confronts Ultron in the church. By holding his hands to Ultron's cheeks, Vision interfaces with him, and is able to burn him out of the Internet, meaning he can only transfer himself to his drones. Ultron doesn't take his loss lying down, and out of spite, he activates the drill, causing the city to ascend into the sky, with no way to evacuate those still in it. Fortunately, not all is lost, for Fury and Rhodey turn up with a helicarrier, and dispatch flying lifeboats to ferry evacuees off the rock.The Avengers begin making their way towards the church. At one point, while assisting Clint, Wanda has a panic attack when an Ultron sentry tries to dive-bomb them both, but Clint is able to re-motivate her into rejoining the fight, and she comes back to rescue him as he finds himself cornered by several drones while reloading his quiver. Elsewhere, Pietro gets grazed in the shoulder by a police officer's bullet when he and Wanda run in to eliminate several drones that are trading fire with some police officers. Thor gets into a one-on fight with Ultron in the church and nearly gets strangled by him, but is rescued when Vision uses Mjolnir to punt Ultron out of the church.Eventually, the nine Avengers converge on the church and take up positions around the drill. Ultron summons his remaining drones to swarm them en masse. After a short battle, the Avengers decimate the majority of the drone army. Ultron also engages them, but Vision separates him from the main battle, and fires a laser from the Mind Stone to drive him back. With assistance from Tony's uni-beams and Thor's lightning, they inflict severe damage to the primary body, melting the right side of his face, and the Hulk then tosses him away as he tries to monologue.With most of the drones taken care of, the Avengers work on getting the last evacuees onto the lifeboats. Wanda volunteers to guard the drill, and shoos Pietro away when he insists on taking her. Meanwhile, Ultron lands near the Avengers' quinjet and decides to hijack it. He takes to the sky and goes on a strafing run, firing the quinjet's Gatling guns at full auto, disrupting Natasha's efforts to give her lullaby to the Hulk and taking aim at Clint, who has been forced to go back into town to find a young boy, Costel (who in a deleted scene is shown to have been how Ultron got the twins to find him in the church), who is still trapped. Clint shields the boy from the approaching gunfire when at the last second, Pietro runs in front of him, intercepting the bullets at the cost of his own life. In the church, Wanda senses his death and collapses to her knees in grief while letting out an anguished scream and a burst of energy that vaporizes the majority of the remaining drones on the ground.As Ultron prepares to flee, and Steve and Clint move Pietro's body onto a lifeboat, Hulk deposits Natasha on the helicarrier. He then makes a running leap onto the quinjet and rips Ultron from the cockpit seat, sending him plummeting into the city center. Ultron crash-lands in an abandoned streetcar outside the church. Moments later, Wanda enters the streetcar, hands shaking with rage. He begs her to leave for her own safety. To give him a taste of what she's feeling, she promptly tears the power core out of his chest, shutting him down.In Wanda's absence, one of the remaining Ultron drones reactivates. It manages to crawl over to the drill and turns the key to deactivate it. Novi Grad begins plummeting towards the Earth. Tony flies down to the base of the vibranium core, while Thor makes his way to the key controlling the drill. Tony cuts open a hole, and fires an energy beam up the interior of the shaft, heating it to super high temperatures, while Thor summons lightning from above with Mjolnir. As the energy that Tony is firing reaches the top of the shaft, and Vision flies into the falling city to rescue Wanda, Thor slams Mjolnir down on the drill switch at Tony's command. The resulting shock-wave causes a massive explosion that shatters the falling rock into thousands of smaller pieces that rain down on a nearby lake.In the Quinjet, the Hulk closes the rear hatch that he threw Ultron out of, as Natasha sends him a video message from the helicarrier to tell him that they've been victorious, but now he needs to turn the quinjet around and return to them. Still feeling riddled with guilt over the events in Johannesburg, the Hulk cuts off Natasha's message and continues to fly on-wards to parts unknown.Ultron is not quite finished off yet. In the crater that now takes up a big chunk of what used to Novi Grad, his consciousness still survives in the form of a drone that Steve had knocked over the side early on in the battle, and which has lost part of its left arm. As the drone makes it to the top of the crater, Vision intercepts him. The two have a brief exchange of ideas, before the drone tries to attack Vision, only for Vision to use his laser to vaporize him.In the aftermath of the battle, Clint returns home to his family. Laura eventually gives birth to a boy, whom they choose to name Nathaniel Pietro Barton, after Natasha and the dead Pietro. Meanwhile, the Avengers establish a new training facility in upstate New York, overseen by Fury, Cho, Maria Hill, and Selvig. Natasha assumes Bruce is dead because the quinjet cannot be tracked in stealth mode, and silently mourns for him, but Fury assures her that he is likely still alive. Believing that Vision will keep the Mind Stone is safe with Vision, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the Infinity Stones, while Tony also elects to go back to his personal life and step back from Avenger work. Steve and Natasha vow to continue the Avengers' work, and the movie ends with them going to meet their new team, who we see is comprised of Wanda, Vision, War Machine, and Falcon.In a mid-credits scene, Thanos (Josh BrolinJosh Brolin), dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons the Infinity Gauntlet and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones personally..."

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters.

When a sudden change in the life of Riley upsets their rhythm, they try to control the situation too much, which creates more confusion for her. Their adventures in an attempt to restore normalcy is what forms the crux of this movie.—PipingHotViews [Shriram] Emotions run wild in the mind of a little girl who is uprooted from her peaceful life in the Midwest and forced to move to San Francisco in this Pixar adventure from director Pete Docter (Up, Monsters Inc.). Young Riley was perfectly content with her life when her father landed a new job in San Francisco, and the family moved across the country. Now, as Riley prepares to navigate a new city and attend a new school, her emotional headquarters becomes a hot bed of activity. As Joy (voice of Amy Poehler) attempts to keep Riley feeling happy and positive about the move, other emotions like Fear (voice of Bill Hader), Anger (voice of Lewis Black), Disgust (voice of Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) make the transition a bit more complicated. Riley is a girl born in Minnesota. Five emotions live inside her head. They are responsible for her actions and make her memories. The memories are kept as balls. They each give a different color depending on the emotion of the memory. The most important memories are core memories that power islands of personality. They reflect a different aspect of Riley's life. Joy makes Riley happy. Fear keeps her safe. Disgust prevents her from being poisoned, physically and socially. Anger makes her life fair. Sadness however, doesn't seem to have a purpose. She's ignored as a result.Riley turns eleven. Her parents move to San Francisco. Sadness has a magical touch. When she touches a memory, it turns sad and blue, and it can't be changed back to what it was before. Joy forbids Sadness from touching any more memories until she finds out what's going on. The first day at the new school, Joy has Sadness stand inside a circle so she can't spread her gloominess. Riley talks about her life in Minnesota. Joy brings up a memory and has it played on a projector in Riley's head. Sadness wanders outside her circle and touches the memory, turning it sad. While the emotions are trying to remove the memory from the projector, Sadness takes control of the console, making Riley cry in front of her classmates. A new core memory is created. This core memory is sad and blue. Riley's only had happy core memories before. Joy sees sad memories as a bad thing. She tries to get rid of it. Sadness tries to stop her, saying it's a core memory. In their struggle, all the core memories are knocked from the holder they're kept in. Joy, Sadness and the core memories are sucked up the tube, into the far depths of Riley's mind.Joy and Sadness are in Long Term Memory, a labyrinth of corridors of shelves of memories. They meet Riley's former imaginary friend Bing Bong, who's desperate to reconnect with Riley. He says the Train of Thought can take them back to Headquarters. Their journey takes them through Abstract Thought and Imagination Land. Parts of Preschool World are being demolished, Princess Dream World and the Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame. Mind workers are taking Bing Bong's song-powered rocket to the Memory Dump, a deep pit where obsolete memories are erased. A plow pushes the rocket into the dump. Bing Bong is really upset over the loss of his rocket. He's completely unresponsive when Joy tries to cheer him up. Sadness listens to what Bing Bong has to say. He and Riley had great adventures together. They were best friends. It's sad. Bing Bong hugs Sadness. He cries candy. He's okay now. He continues to take the emotions to the train station. Joy wonders how did Sadness do that?In Headquarters, Fear, Anger and Disgust try to take charge in Joy's absence. They're unable to make Riley happy. Dinner ends in disaster. The father sends Riley to her room for her rude, disrespectful behavior. Later that evening, the father can't cheer Riley up with his monkey noises. Riley dumps her best friend and quits hockey. Goofball Island, Friendship Island and Hockey Island fall into the Memory Dump. Anger comes up with the idea: Riley's happy core memories were made in Minnesota. The only way for her to be happy is to return there and make more.Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong are on the Train of Thought. Unfortunately, the train does not run while Riley's asleep. They enter Dream Productions. Joy's idea is to wake Riley up with exhilaration, excite her awake. A dog costume, Joy is in the front. Sadness is in the back. Bing Bong lets down a brightly colored curtain and balloons. The dog costume is ripped in half, but due to the reality distortion filter, it looks as if a real dog has split in two in the dream. Despite all this, Riley stays asleep. Security men capture Bing Bong and take him to the Subconscious, a place where they keep Riley's deepest, darkest fears. Bing Bong is trapped in a cage of balloons, on the belly of a giant, sleeping birthday clown named Jangles. Joy frees Bing Bong. Before they leave, Joy and Sadness wake up Jangles who chases them into Dream Productions. Fear is on dream duty. The sight of Jangles really scares him and wakes up Riley. The train is running again.Bing Bong picks out a memory. It's the time in the twisty tree. Mom and Dad and the hockey team are cheering Riley. Sadness loves this memory too. ""It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit.""Anger carries out his idea to run away. Riley is led to steal her mother's credit card to pay for her travel expenses. Honesty Island crumbles. The crumbling island bashes into the railway line of the Train of Thought. The train crashes against Long Term Memory. Mind workers rescue Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong from the train, before it falls into the Memory Dump. The three characters find a recall tube. When Sadness tries to get in the tube, the core memories start to turn blue. Joy thinks Riley should be happy. She closes the tube and starts to get sucked up, leaving Sadness and Bing Bong behind. As Long Term Memory crumbles and breaks away, the recall tube shatters. Joy and Bing Bong fall into the Memory Dump.Joy finds the sad core memory. She looks back over Riley's obsolete memories. She just wanted Riley to be happy. She picks up the twisty tree memory and rewinds it to find it's sad at the beginning. Sadness' words echo ""It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit."" Mom and Dad and the team, they came to help because of Sadness. Joy and Bing Bong find the song-powered rocket. They try to use it to escape the dump, but the rocket falls short each time. The third time they power up the rocket, Bing Bong gets out of the rocket at the last second, allowing Joy to escape the dump. Bing Bong thanks Joy for letting him be important one last time, before fading away. In Headquarters, the emotions discover running away was a bad idea. Family Island, the last remaining island starts to break apart and fall. The console starts to shut itself down and become inactive. Riley becomes completely unresponsive to the emotions' commands. They can't make Riley feel anything. They're also unable to remove the idea bulb to run away.Joy looks around for Sadness, but Sadness now believes her actions only hurt Riley. She's floating around on a rain cloud. The imaginary boyfriend generator, imaginary boyfriend says he would die for Riley. It's time for him to prove it. Joy has the machine make lots of copies of imaginary boyfriends. She unties a balloon and lets the air out, blowing it towards Sadness so her cloud floats towards Headquarters. Joy builds a ladder of imaginary boyfriends. She's standing on top of the ladder. She lets the ladder fall down. She bounces off a Family Island trampoline. She's flying through the air over the Memory Dump. She grabs Sadness. The two emotions hit against the window of Headquarters. Anger throws a chair at the window. The window does not break. Disgust provokes Anger so that he gets really angry. He's the Anger emotion. When he's really angry, fire bursts from his head. Disgust uses his flaming head to burn a hole in the window and let Joy and Sadness in.Sadness is magically able to remove the idea bulb, so Riley comes home. Joy allows Sadness to touch the core memories so they all turn sad. She allows Sadness to play the sad memories in the projector in Riley's head. Sadness takes control of the console. A tearful Riley admits she misses Minnesota. She wants her old friends and her hockey team. The parents need her to be happy, but she wants to go home. The parents are not angry. They miss Minnesota too, the woods where they took hikes, the backyard where she used to play and Spring Lake where she learned to skate. The parents hug Riley deeply. Sadness takes Joy's hand and they both press a button together. A new core memory is created. This core memory is yellow and blue, happy and sad.Sadness has finally found a place to work alongside her fellow emotions. They have a new expanded console. The core memories are a mixture of emotions now. Riley has new friends and a new house. She's twelve now. What could happen?"

In the opening scene set in London, England, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) stands by his brother Owen's (Luke Evans) bedside as he lays in a coma, badly scarred and crippled after being ejected from the plane (in the last Fast and Furious film). Shaw promises his brother that he will settle the score. He leaves the room and goes out into the rest of the hospital, with bodies everywhere. The building continues to burn and crumble around him.Meanwhile, Dom (Vin DIesel) drives Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) to a racetrack in the California desert where hundreds of people from their neighborhood gather for Race Wars, something that Dom and Letty invented when they were younger. Letty goes up for the race and flies past her opponent as his car breaks down on the track. All the patrons cheer her on after she crosses the finish line, followed by Iggy Azalea showing up out of nowhere to congratulate Letty. The excitement of the others is too overwhelming for Letty, and she takes the car and drives away. Dom later finds her that night at the cemetery, staring at her own tombstone. Dom takes a sledgehammer to smash it, but Letty stops him because she thinks the person she used to be is no longer who she is to Dom, and she doesn't want to hurt him for that. She bids Dom goodbye.Brian (Paul Walker) is adjusting to life as a minivan-driving dad, as his son Jack is now old enough for school. Even his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom's sister, acknowledges that he has had trouble settling down this way.That evening, Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) continues to do some overnight work while Elena (Elsa Pataky) is getting ready to go out. Hobbs hands her a letter of recommendation that she asked him for. He wishes her luck in her pursuits. Hobbs then sees Shaw in his office hacking into his computer. Hobbs attempts to arrest him as he is gathering the information on the crew that took down his brother. Shaw battles Hobbs through the whole floor, they smash each other through glass walls and coffee tables, while Hobbs manages to get a good chokeslam down on Shaw. Elena returns for back-up as Shaw gets a grenade out. He tosses it towards the detectives, forcing Hobbs to run to Elena as the grenade explodes, sending them both out the window where they land, Hobbs first, on a van. Elena is unharmed. In the office, it is shown that Shaw was looking for Han (Sung Kang).Dom visits Mia at her home as Brian is getting Jack ready for school. Outside their house is a large package. Mia tells Dom that she is having another child, but she hasn't told Brian for fear of how he'd react to more changes. Dom gets a call from Shaw, listening to his message after killing Han (from the end of the previous film). Dom realizes there's trouble, and he grabs Mia as the package explodes massively, destroying the whole house. Jack is safe in the minivan, though his parents rush to him in a panic.Dom follows Elena to Hobbs's hospital room. He tells Dom who Shaw is, including his history in the Special Forces, where he was turned into a human killing machine. Hobbs asks Dom to promise him he will take Shaw down for good. Dom agrees. Meanwhile, Brian sends Mia and their son to hide out in the Dominican Republic until this thing with Shaw is taken care of. He promises Mia that he will return as long as they are safe.Dom flies to Tokyo to bring Han back for a proper burial. He meets with Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), Han's friend (from the third film Fast and Furious 3: Toyko Drift). After the two have their race, Sean gives him the only things they could find from Han's car: a picture of Gisele and a cross necklace.Back in California, the gang gathers for Han's funeral, joined by Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson). Dom spots a car suspiciously driving near the funeral. He follows it, learning it is Shaw. They crash into each other in a tunnel, and they briefly fight until a team of agents comes in, giving Shaw a chance to escape. Their leader, a shadowy agent known only as ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell), brings Dom with him and gathers Brian, Tej, Roman, and finally Letty to work together on a mission. A hacker known only as Ramsey has been captured by a terrorist leader named Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), because he is pursuing something Ramsey helped develop called God's Eye, which is a surveillance system that can spot anybody from anywhere in the world. Using this, Dom can locate Shaw. The guys come up with a plan to infiltrate the bus that is carrying Ramsey, while Dom asks Tej to help him put armor on one car.The plan involves the five dropping from a jet in their cars and carefully land close to their target. Roman gets cold feet, prompting Tej to pull the chute out on him and sucking him out of the plane. The other four land close to the bus and break in. Jakande's men shoot at the team. Brian hops on the bus and fights off the guards. He finds Ramsey... a young woman (Nathalie Emmanuel) in her cell and has her jump off the bus and onto the hood of Dom's car for safety. He then dukes it out with a minion named Kiet (Tony Jaa), who is a tough fighter. In the madness, the driver of the bus is accidentally shot. Kiet locks Brian on the bus as he gets out. The bus slides toward the edge of a cliff. Brian climbs out and manages to run off the bus and onto Letty's car as she arrives in time to grab him. Meanwhile, Dom and Ramsey encounter Shaw, leading them both through the woods. Roman appears and knocks Shaw off the road. However, Jakande and his team find Dom. Before they can get him, he drives his car off a cliff, yet he and Ramsey miraculously survive.The team revives Ramsey, who tells them that she gave God's Eye to a friend of hers in Abu Dhabi. They all travel there and meet this person, Safar (Ali Fazal), who says he sold God's Eye to a prince. The team goes undercover to a party that the prince is throwing. Dom and Brian find that God's Eye is in a car. Letty ends up fighting three guards and the prince's chief bodyguard Kara (Ronda Rousey). Kara alerts the guards that there are intruders, keeping Tej and Ramsey out of their systems. Dom and Brian drive the car out of there before the gates shut the place down. Shaw comes out and tries to shoot at Dom, until he drives out of the building and through the next one. Dom discovers that the brakes are out, forcing him and Brian to jump to the next building. The two jump out of the car and pull God's Eye out before the car slides out and crashes to the ground below.With God's Eye, the team learns that Shaw is hiding out in an abandoned factory outside the city. After tracking him there, they see that he has a lot of back-up from Jakande. The team evades gunfire, when Mr. Nobody gets shot in the chaos. Dom carries him out, and Jakande gets his hands on God's Eye. Mr. Nobody calls for medical assistance, and tells Dom that he will be leaving him.The team knows that it's time to end it with Shaw once and for all. They decide to take the fight back to the streets of their hometown in Los Angeles. Brian calls Mia to tell her he loves her in case he doesn't make it back. Mia tells him that they're having a little girl. Brian then promises to come back to her.Tej and Roman take Ramsey with them while they try and hack God's Eye to prevent Jakande from finding Ramsey. Dom finds Shaw and lures him to a parking lot where they have their final showdown. They have a street fight, dueling with wrenches and pipes. Meanwhile, Jakande, in an armored Stealth Black Hawk helicopter, sends a flying armored drone to find Ramsey. They end up shooting down an electrical tower, which catches Hobbs's attention after watching it on the news. He announces ""Daddy's gotta go to work"" and breaks off the cast on his arm, and then gears up.Ramsey gets switched under the bridge and goes with Lettty while Brian tries to find a new spot to hack God's Eye. He encounters Kiet again and kills him when he hooks him up to a weight and pushes him down an elevator shaft. The drone chases after Letty and Ramsey, nearly getting them until Hobbs rides in on an ambulance and destroys it by crashing into it with the ambulance off the freeway ramp. Hobbs exits the totaled ambulance, shaken but still alive.They succeed in the hack, and Jakande is furious. He and his men locate Dom and Shaw still fighting on the roof of the parking garage. They shoot a missile at the lot, causing the ground to break beneath Shaw's feet. Dom stomps on the concrete and drops Shaw through the lot. Jakande continues shooting at Dom as he drives away, but Hobbs shoots back. Dom grabs a bag of grenades and drives close enough to stick them onto Jakande's chopper. Hobbs shoots at the bag, destroying the chopper and Jakande. Dom crashes his car and is pulled out by Brian and Letty. Letty begs him to stay alive and says she remembers that they got married in the Dominican Republic. That's where he gave her the cross necklace that Han had. Dom awakens and kisses Letty.Shaw is locked up for good in a maximum security black site prison. He threatens to break out, though Hobbs doubts that it will ever happen.The team watches Brian and Mia play with Jack on the beach. They realize this is where he belongs, and they look at them lovingly. Dom gets up to leave. Ramsey asks if he's gonna say goodbye. Dom says, ""It's never goodbye."" He drives away, only to get caught up with Brian on the road.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951266/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Katniss and a team of rebels from District 13 prepare for the final battle that will decide the fate of Panem. After young Katniss Everdeen agrees to be the symbol of rebellion, the Mockingjay, she tries to return Peeta to his normal state, tries to get to the Capitol, and tries to deal with the battles coming her way...but all for her main goal: assassinating President Snow and returning peace to the Districts of Panem. As her squad starts to get smaller and smaller, will she make it to the Capitol? Will she get revenge on Snow or will her target change? Will she be with her ""Star-Crossed Lover,"" Peeta, or her long-time friend, Gale? Deaths, bombs, bow and arrows, a love triangle, hope... What will happen?—baileyyybroooks After Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, accepted the role of the Mockingjay, the symbol of rebellion against the autocratic Capitol, she and the rebels of District 13 poise an all-out war against them; however, this time Katniss has a personal agenda: assassinating President Snow herself to gain revenge not only for Panem's sake but for her own as well. After accepting her role as the Mockingjay, Katniss Everdeen, along with her team, prepares to take their fight straight to the ruthless Capitol. While her mission is to bring President Snow down once and for all, Katniss finds that her squad dies at the hands of either Mutts, Peacekeepers or both. Once in the Capitol, Katniss discovers that there is another threat rising that could decide not only her fate but the future of all Panem.—Blazer346 For all past deaths made as entertainment, and for the insidious modification of Peeta, Katriss deems to strike out on her own to take down President Snow once and for all, but being the Mockingjay, the living symbol of the rebellion now headed by Alma Coin, has its drawbacks. Recognition, for one, and she finds herself saddled with a team of expert warriors (which surprisingly includes the ailing Peeta) aimed to penetrate the Capitol that has barricaded itself behind Hunger-Game-style death traps. As she closes in on carrying out her private agenda through more deaths and mayhem, President Snow himself makes her aware of another threat to peace for Panem equal to himself, leaving her to consider how to truly end the bloodshed.—statmanjeff In the opening scene, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is getting vocal therapy after being nearly choked to death by Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) inThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014). Once she can properly speak, she sees her younger sister Primrose ""Prim"" Everdeen (Willow Shields) entering Peeta's cell. The hijack programming inflicted on Peeta in the Capitol eventually makes him freak out. He thinks that Katniss is a dangerous Capitol-created mutation, and tells Prim to kill her.Katniss wants to take her revenge on President Snow for what he has done to Peeta, but president Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) assures her that there is no way that they can enter the Capitol now; they need to control District 2 first, so Katniss goes there with her military escort to film more ""propos"" (propaganda videos) for the rebel cause. Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) accompanies her. He admits that he has seen Peeta, and realized that if he stays this way, Katniss will always chose him over Gale out of pity. On the way, she kisses Gale, but he calls it ""the kiss of a drunk person."" She jokes that with Peeta safely in Thirteen, he doesn't have to be jealous anymore.Katniss overhears Gale and Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) discussing a dubious trick they mean to employ. It involves setting off a bomb that is designed to send people fleeing in a panic and attract medics to help the wounded, and then deploying a second bomb to maximize the number of victims. Katniss protests against this unethical wasting of lives, with Gale telling her that Snow doesn't fight by the rules either. Once in District 2, Commander Paylor (Patina Miller) mentions that the Rebellion has failed to capture the Nut, a huge mountain base that serves as a Capitol headquarters for all their offensive operations. It will be vital to secure the weapons inside, or at the very least disable the base and deprive the enemy of them, otherwise even the united rebels will remain outgunned by the Capitol. However, since the occupants of the Nut are dug in safely, a frontal assault has proven to be pointless, and there is little chance that they will surrender willingly as District 2 is still sympathetic to the Capitol. Gale suggests that they bomb the stronghold's weak points and blow the exits, trapping everyone inside. Katniss protests, saying that there are a lot of civilians in there. With President Coin listening in via hologram, the group eventually agrees that they will strategically bomb the Nut first in order to flush out the civilians by trains, but once outside, they will get the chance to surrender first; Katniss will be waiting there to convince them.When the hovercrafts go, Gale continues to argue the situation with Katniss: he still thinks that bombing the Nut is justifiable, similar to when Katniss shot planes out of the sky in District 8 during her propo tour inThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014); Katniss disagrees, stating that she was defending herself from military pilots, not citizens. Gale replies that the civilians in the Nut made their choice by collaborating with the enemy, and this is unfortunately the cost of war, to which Katniss counters that that kind of thinking justifies almost every death, including killing children in the Hunger Games.Katniss is delivered to the Nut's exit when the refugees arrive by train. The rebel troops treat the refugees with suspicion, ordering them to drop their weapons and shooting some who don't comply. Katniss addresses them, hoping to get their sympathy; however, one of the refugees quickly uses her distraction to hold her hostage. He tells Katniss, ""Give me a reason why I shouldn't shoot."" Katniss replies that she can't: the rebels have been at each others' throats with attacks back and forth because Snow has been setting the districts up against each other, providing them with plenty of reasons to kill one other. She's so tired of being Snow's slave that dying would be a relief. The man lets her go, and while Katniss continues to convince the others that President Snow is the real enemy whom they should fight and not each other, another refugee takes a shot at her. Chaos ensues.In the Capitol, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) celebrates with his delegates with a toast at his dinner table, but they all drink without stating what it is they're drinking to. Snow asks his minister of defense, Antonius (Robert Knepper), what they are celebrating, since their mountain troops have been defeated and rebels are currently marching towards them. He replies that it's Katniss's death, and that the rebels can be held off. Snow replies that if Katniss were really dead, the resistance would have made a martyr out of her already, and he criticizes Antonius' strategy for diverting their best Peacekeepers to the now lost District 2. Snow plans to evacuate the Capitol's outskirts to lure the rebels in, and then let them be decimated by strategically placed bombs and booby traps, all being televised by the Gamemakers; the rebels will pay for their victory in blood, captured on camera for an eternity, so they are toasting on ""a glorious era coming to its bitter end."" Antonius suddenly starts to choke and drops dead, having been poisoned.Katniss wakes up from her injuries to find a bald, morphling-crazed Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) in her room. She pulls out Katniss's morphling drip and attaches it to her own arm. Apparently, Cinna was smart enough to make Katniss's clothes bulletproof, so she survives with a nasty bruise on her chest. Johanna is annoyed with the fact that everyone has to sacrifice themselves for the irreplaceable Katniss; however, she concedes that her anger is partially from jealousy, since they chose Katniss as the symbol for the uprising instead of Johanna, who, admittedly, lacks Katniss's charm and lovability. Katniss manages to ease Johanna's sarcasm by admitting that Johanna would have made a better Mockingjay.Next, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) visits Katniss, convincing her that Peeta is much better now and that she should visit him. Peeta, who's still locked in a cell and strapped to his bed, is no longer enraged but still blames Katniss for everything, going so far as saying that if he had never given her the overdone bread from his parents' bakery (which he had burned on purpose so he could toss it to her), they would have never ended up in this state.Katniss is visibly upset and goes on to a conference with President Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Katniss wants to be with the troops in the Capitol, but Coin disagrees: Katniss has done her job, with the districts are now successfully united. She needs to heal first, so Coin orders her to stay and shoot more propos in Thirteen to show the rebels that she is still alive; when the Capitol surrenders, she will be taken there for the ceremony. Plutarch offers no objections, so Katniss begrudgingly agrees.Katniss then attends the wedding of Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Annie Cresta (Stef Dawson). At the reception, everyone is happy and dancing except Katniss. Johanna finds her brooding and Katniss says she is done with all the propos; she wants to kill Snow now and end the conflict. Johanna is surprisingly sympathetic to this idea, offering to cover for Katniss and suggesting a plan: sneak on board a medical supply hovercraft headed for the Capitol. She convinces Katniss that it can work, as long as she is willing to sacrifice herself in the process. Katniss goes off to dance with her sister Prim, hugging her before following Johanna's plan.When the hovercraft drops Katniss at the rebels' base with the medical supplies outside the Capitol, Katniss tries to be unobtrusive, but is quickly recognized by almost everyone she encounters. She finds Gale and people crowd around, curious and believing that Katniss has chosen to join the fight. Learning that Katniss has fled to the front, President Coin is extremely annoyed by her defiance, but being unable to control her, she has no choice but to follow Plutarch's suggestion, which is to act as if this has been their plan all along.Commander Paylor makes a speech, stating that the Capitol is surrounded by rebels and its citizens are abandoning the streets. The Peacekeepers have fallen back to the center, so the united rebels will enter the city's outskirts and help the confused citizens. The Gamemakers have placed ""pods"" all over the Capitol, armed with deadly weapons, similar to traps used in the Hunger Games in an attempt to make this another televised spectacle. However, the rebels will overcome these obstacles, convene at Snow's mansion, and free all of Panem from his tyranny.Gale notes how Katniss has been packing for a solo mission, and lets her know that he already knows that she intends to walk off on her own. They are both assigned to Squad 451, which is commanded by Boggs (Mahershala Ali) and also includes Finnick, filmmaker Cressida (Natalie Dormer), Homes (Omid Abtahi), Lt. Jackson (Michelle Forbes), Mitchell (Joe Chrest), Messalla (Evan Ross), the twins Leeg 1 and 2 (Misty OrmistonandKim Ormiston) and Castor (Wes Chatham) and Pollux (Elden Henson), an avox (mute). Squad 451 will shoot propaganda videos while locating and destroying the pods. They are ordered to remain behind the front lines to stay as safe as possible, while boosting morale with their propaganda videos. Each member is given a Nightlock pill, which causes instant death if they need to commit suicide to stay out of the Capitol's hands. Boggs has been issued a holo, a device that displays a holographic map and helps to detect pods; however, the information on the pods is based on intelligence from spies, and new pods have undoubtedly been set up to kill them (Finnick calls it ""the 76th Hunger Games""). The holo can also self-destruct if it is in danger of falling into enemy hands.The squad assembles and finds the first pod. Katniss fires an arrow toward it, which triggers a giant explosion. The squad decides to camp out in an abandoned restaurant for the night, and Katniss and Gale discuss plans to sneak off with the holo on their own when Peeta is unexpectedly dropped off by a military escort, in handcuffs. The soldiers delivering him explain that President Coin wants Peeta in the videos as well, to show him actively fighting the Capitol alongside Katniss. Katniss is on edge, and the group decides to take turns watching him. Boggs takes a puzzled Katniss aside and tells her the truth about Coin. He says that Coin originally wanted Peeta saved from the arena and not her, as Katniss is uncontrollable; Coin may have added Peeta to the team in the hope that he'll try to kill Katniss in a fit of rage and fear. Now that victory is at hand, Katniss may become a liability for Coin, who wants to be the next President of Panem. Though Katniss has no political aspirations, her allegiance to any candidate carries considerable weight; because Coin can't be sure that Katniss will endorse her, she prefers to be rid of her now, as Katniss' death would add more fire to the Rebellion. Boggs tells her that he will not let that happen, and promises her a long life.Night falls and Peeta can't sleep. He and Katniss talk, and they play a game to help Peeta figure out what is real and what parts of his memories are planted by Capitol programming. As day comes, Finnick helps Peeta (who remains in handcuffs most of the time for safety) as they explore the city, entering an oval courtyard surrounded by abandoned apartment buildings. They're getting ready to shoot a propo when a pod of machine guns appears, but everyone dodges the hail of bullets. As they walk forward, Boggs is suddenly shot in his chest by a hidden gun, and Leeg 1 takes a bullet in the leg. Boggs, with his dying breath, transfers full security access of the holo to Katniss. He also tells her not to trust anyone, and to kill Peeta if necessary. Leeg 2 accidentally activates a trigger hidden under the pavement, releasing a torrent of black ooze which floods towards the team and quickly submerges the courtyard. While escaping, Peeta becomes frightened; his Capitol brainwashing is activated and he tries to kill Katniss with a bow. Mitchell intervenes and in the process, Peeta shoves him in the ooze which causes him to fly up and get impaled by spikes.The surviving members of Squad 451 run inside a building. Jackson, as Boggs' second in command, demands the holo from Katniss. Katniss says that Boggs transferred the voice-activated holo to her (which is true) and that she is on a personal mission to kill Snow, on orders of President Coin (which isn't). Jackson doesn't believe it and commands Katniss to transfer the holo to her, but Katniss refuses. A Mexican standoff occurs, but eventually Jackson backs down when Cressida unexpectedly backs up Katniss's story, saying that Plutarch wants the assassination of Snow to be televised, hoping that it will quickly end the war (not true either). Leeg 2 decides to stay behind with her injured twin; Jackson promises to send help as soon as they can. Peacekeeper soldiers arrive as soon as the rest of the squad exits the building and take refuge in a vacant apartment across the courtyard. They watch in horror as the Peacekeepers blow up the building they just left, killing the Leeg twins.Suddenly, a broadcast pops up. Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) announces the death of Katniss and her squad as the building blowing up is televised. Peeta feels extremely guilty over snapping and causing Mitchell's death, and nearly killing Katniss; he asks for a Nightlock pill so he can kill himself when he feels he is being hijacked again, but the others refuse. President Snow then pops up on television, remembering Katniss as ""a face plucked from the masses"" who lacked leadership, and that the rebellion has no vision. Then Coin takes over the broadcast, defending Katniss as a brave girl who ""rose up and turned a nation of slaves into an army"", and asserting that the Mockingjay is still the face of the revolution, even in death.The squad wants to head for the President's mansion now that they are believed dead, but the holo shows multiple traps on the streets, excluding all the new ones that have undoubtedly been set up. Pollux signs to Castor that they can go down into the underground sanitation system instead, a place where he did slave labor and is reluctant to go back to, but they have no choice. Underground, they hide from the peacekeepers but are seen on the security camera. President Snow, whose nose is bleeding, is then shown the security camera footage and is surprised to see Katniss still alive, stating that the arena has now moved underground.In the sewage system, after narrowly avoiding a steam pipe burst, the team decides to sleep. Katniss indulges Peeta in more games of 'Real or Not Real'. Peeta reveals that the Capitol used wasp Tracker Jacker venom in his programming, but his capacity to discern fake memories from real ones is getting better. Katniss promises to keep them alive, but then hears something and the group investigates. Something has been sent after them.After some intense searching (almost like a horror movie), suddenly dozens of hideous, lizard-human hybrid creatures which are called ""mutts"" (muttations, portmanteau of 'mutt' and 'mutation') appear from all directions and attack. Jackson is quickly overwhelmed and is either torn apart and/or bitten to death by the weird creatures. The remaining group fights them off and tries to escape through the sewage system. Castor is trampled and killed by the creatures, while Cressida and Messalla are separated from the rest of the group as more creatures converge on them. The squad is corralled into a junction area space with a ladder leading up to the ceiling. Here, Katniss is nearly killed by one creature but she and Peeta fight them off (she with her bow and explosive-tipped arrows, and he with his assault rifle) as they stand back to back fighting. Cressida and Messalla reappear where they assist the group and order them to escape up the ladder. Cressida takes on and guns down several of the creatures herself, showing more of her fearless combat skills. Finnick uses his trident to fight off the creatures while the remaining members of the squad escape up the ladder. Unfortunately, this turns out to be his sacrifice; as he tries to ascend the ladder, the creatures overwhelm him. Not wanting Finnick to die in vain, Katniss activates the holo's self-destruct function, and throws it into the melee of mutts and a screaming Finnick. The holo explodes, killing the mutts, ending Finnick's suffering and collapsing the exit for more creatures.In an underground space that looks like a subway station, the surviving members of the squad run across a floor, fired upon by Peacekeepers. As the floor begins to collapse, lethal beams in the light fixtures kill those who pass under them. Messalla runs into a beam and disintegrates into black ash while Peeta panics, thinking he's about to go out of control again. Katniss stops and kisses him, which fixes him right up. They get out to the surface and Cressida takes them to a fashion shop owned by Tigris (Eugenie Bondurant), who sports elaborate tiger-stripe tattoos and has apparently had some surgery to make her mouth and nose look more feline. She hides the five surviving members of the squad in a secret basement under her shop. Katniss eventually recognizes Tigris as one of the stylists who worked with contestants at the games. Tigris indicates that her tiger makeover was forced on her by President Snow ""because I wasn't pretty enough anymore.""While hiding underground, Pollux weeps over the loss of his brother Castor, while Cressida tends to Gale's wounds, sustained while fighting the mutts. A distraught Katniss confesses that her mission was fake and that she feels responsible for all those deaths. Cressida tells her that they knew all along that she wasn't on a mission ordered by Coin, but everyone, even Jackson, decided it was worth the risk if Boggs thought so. Peeta mentions his Capitol programming and tells Katniss to end all of it. He tells her that if she kills Snow, all deaths, from their first Hunger Games until now, will be for something. He tells Katniss to handcuff him again to be safe from him.While Katniss tries to sleep, Gale and Peeta reconcile. Gale tells Peeta that she loves Peeta, not him (""she never kissed me like that""). Suddenly, there is sound of mortars and guns, signaling that the rebels are approaching the center and are attacking the Peacekeepers. An emergency broadcast pops up with President Snow ordering Capitol residents to take shelter in the presidential mansion -- the Rebellion has arrived, and he claims that they plan to destroy every Capitol citizen and their way of life. As the pods near the mansion will presumably be deactivated, Katniss decides to walk with the refugees, infiltrate the mansion and take down Snow once and for all. Gale decides to go with her; Katniss uncuffs Peeta.Peeta offers to come with Katniss, since everyone knows him and he may serve as an distraction, but Katniss doesn't want to lose him again, and asks Cressida and Pollux to stay and watch him. He states that he will take a Nightlock pill before he will let any Peacekeepers take him back. Tigris outfits Katniss and Gale with hooded coats that partially obscure their faces. As they march towards Snow's mansion with the other refugees, Katniss is almost recognized by a little girl who is carried by her mother. When they see Peacekeeper soldiers checking everyone's faces, they try to go back, but are forced to follow the crowd when the Peacekeepers start closing in from behind as well. Just as a Peacekeeper is about to expose Katniss, a nearby tank explodes -- the rebel soldiers have arrived at the city's center, and a panic ensues. Katniss sees the little girl weeping over her dead mother as Gale is captured by the Peacekeepers and dragged away. He screams at her to shoot him with her bow, but she can't. Katniss runs to the front of Snow's mansion, where she sees parents passing their crying children from hand to hand through the crowd to get them through the mansion's gate -- children were the first priority in the evacuation. Then suddenly, a plane carrying the Capitol logo drops dozens of small, odd silvery pods on little parachutes, reminiscent of the sponsor cylinders sent out to the tributes during the Hunger Games. The crowd watches them fall and some people even reach out for them. The pods then suddenly explode, killing many in the crowd, both adults and children. In the ensuing panic, Katniss sees combat medics rushing in, among them her sister Prim, trying to tend to the wounded. She screams a warning at Prim, only for another batch of bombs to drop and explode, knocking Katniss unconscious.A wounded and burned Katniss wakes up inside Snow's mansion while her mother (Paula Malcomson) tends her wounds. Haymitch informs her that the rebellion was successful: from the moment that the Capitol bombs fell on the citizens, the Peacekeepers and palace guards, who also had children among the dead, immediately stopped fighting, and the palace was taken within a short time. From her mother's wordless tears, Katniss learns that Prim has died.When she's in shape again, Katniss explores the mansion and eventually goes to the garden, where Snow is held under guard in the conservatory. Though no one is allowed access, Commander Paylor grants her an audience with him. Snow is his cheery old self, as always, seemingly accepting defeat. Katniss notes that the presence of the guards unfortunately prevents her from killing Snow there and then. He tells Katniss that he was hoping to speak to her in order to offer his condolences for her sister. He calls her death unnecessary and wasteful, as by that time, defeat was certain, and he was just about to issue the Capitol's surrender when the bombs were suddenly dropped. When Katniss says that *he* dropped those bombs, he admits that he may not be above killing children, but he does not approve of unnecessarily wasting lives, let alone those of Capitol children. As he coughs up some blood and wipes it away with his handkerchief, he calls it a masterful move on Coin's part: making everybody think that Snow would bomb his own people's children to hold back the rebels, and airing it live on TV for everyone to see, turned every last one of his guards against him, who immediately surrendered; he is sure that Katniss's sister wasn't an intended target, but unfortunate collateral damage. Snow believes that Coin's secret plan was to let the districts and the Capitol fight to exhaustion, and then step in herself and take power with District 13's arsenal; she is merely trying to taking Snow's place by using him and Katniss as pawns in her game. When a stunned Katniss says in disgust, ""I don't believe you"", Snow answers, ""Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen, I thought we had agreed never to lie to each other.""Katniss is awaiting an audience with Coin. She meets up with Gale first. She notes that he never came to see her in the hospital, and asks him if the bombs that killed Prim were theirs, as the circumstances of her death closely resemble the 'bomb trap' she heard him discuss earlier. He tearfully admits that he honestly doesn't know whose bombs killed Prim, and apologizes for not protecting her family. Katniss bitterly says ""Goodbye, Gale."" A meeting takes place with Coin and the surviving Victors of previous Hunger Games, including Peeta, Beetee, Johanna, Haymitch, Enobaria (Meta Golding) and a pregnant Annie Cresta. Coin has appointed herself interim President of Panem and says she'll call elections when the time is right, but the people are currently too emotional to vote. Snow is to be executed, but Coin fears that also executing his hundreds of accomplices (Capitol officials, Peacekeepers, torturers and Gamemakers) will only feed the need for more vengeance among the citizens of Panem. She has an idea: instead of endless executions, she wants to hold another Hunger Games, but with Capitol children, and asks the victors to vote on it. Peeta, Annie, and Beetee are strongly against the idea, but Johanna and Enobaria are in favor; it's all up to Katniss and Haymitch. After demanding that she be allowed to execute Snow, which Coin agrees to, Katniss says 'yes' for Prim. Haymitch, after looking at Katniss in bewilderment, nonetheless says ""I'm with the Mockingjay,"" meaning the vote goes in Coin's favor, 4 to 3. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) dresses up Katniss for the execution, and Katniss secretly pockets a Nightlock pill.Katniss marches alone into the arena, the large parade ground where the tributes used to be showcased, and where Snow is bound to a pole. President Coin (who is standing on an elevated stage just behind Snow) makes a speech, telling Panem that in this historic moment, one shot will signify the end of tyranny and begin a new era. She tells Katniss, ""May your aim be as true as your heart is pure."" Katniss aims her arrow at Snow, whose unemotional demeanor starts to waver. Thinking of her last conversation with him and the meeting with Coin before the execution, Katniss realizes that Snow was telling the truth about Coin: she ordered the bombing of Capitol refugees that caused Prim's death, and is now seizing control without the intention to ever let it go. So rather than shooting Snow, Katniss pulls up her bow and shoots Coin, killing her. The crowd is shocked as Coin tumbles to the ground, dead, while President Snow almost chokes from laughter, seeing that his words to Katniss did not fall on deaf ears. As the livid crowd charges past Katniss towards the laughing Snow, she tries to commit suicide by taking the pill, only for Peeta to smack it out of her hand. Katniss is dragged off and taken into custody as the crowd reaches Snow and brutally beats him to death.Katniss is placed in a vacant, guarded room where Haymitch soon arrives, saying that she didn't disappoint, implying that she did what he hoped she would do. He has a letter written to her by Plutarch, which he reads out loud: Plutarch also expresses his approval of Katniss doing the right thing, and regrets not meeting face to face to say their proper goodbyes. The fate of the country will be decided that night in a free election, in which the leaders of the twelve districts will choose an interim leader to replace Coin, and in the light of what happened, it is better if Plutarch is not seen with Katniss. Commander Paylor, who has become ""the voice of reason"", will undoubtedly win. Plutarch laments the burden that befell Katniss and will weigh on her forever, but asserts that it led to the best outcome. The country will now have to heal from all the horrors, and he hopes that it will come through on its promise to learn from past mistakes. He has arranged a passage for Katniss back to District 12, as it will be better for her to live out of sight. When the time is right, she will receive a pardon from Commander Paylor for killing Coin. He ends by stating: ""The country will find its peace, and I hope you can find yours.""Before Katniss and Haymitch board a train to send them home to District 12, Effie comes by to say goodbye, telling Katniss to promise her to find the life of a Victor. Haymitch tells Effie not to be a stranger, kisses her and promises her to take care of Katniss. Back in the Victors Village in District 12, Katniss enters her home. She sees Prim's cat Buttercup in the kitchen and has an emotional meltdown over Prim, shouting at the cat that Prim is gone and never coming back. Then she hugs the cat and cries. She slowly builds herself up again by hunting. One day, she finds that Peeta has returned as well, planting primroses in her garden that he found in the forest -- the flower her sister was named for. They hug and start living together. Some time later, Katniss receives a letter from Annie Cresta, telling her that Katniss's mother is now training new medical units in the Capitol, while Gale has been promoted to captain in District 2. Annie relishes the time she has with her newborn son, who reminds her of Finnick every day.

The Martian,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive and can survive until a potential rescue. During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.—20th Century Fox During their mission in Mars, a team of astronauts is hit by an unpredicted storm and have to abort their mission and leave for Earth. During the evacuation one of the crew members, Mark Watney, is hit by a projectile due to the storm and is thrown away. The crew is forced to leave him thinking he died due to rupture in his space suit. However Mark survives and now has to find ingenious ways to make it till the next scheduled Mars mission fours years later with the remaining meagre supplies. Being a botanist he manages to cultivate food and survives by scavenging parts of previous missions. NASA soon learns about him and attempts a daring and dangerous mission to bring him back. Will they succeed in bringing him back alive? Only time will tell.—Keith Francis After an exploratory mission goes awry, lone astronaut Mark Watney is left for dead on the hostile surface of Mars and must use his scientific ingenuity to homestead an enclosed habitat where he can survive. Meanwhile, the astronauts he left behind realize the severity of his plight and join forces with an international coalition of scientists to launch a rescue mission in defiance of NASA protocol.. In a not-so-distant 2035, the intrepid crew of the Ares III expedition safely lands on the arid red landscape of the distant planet Mars. However, when a sudden space-storm forces them to abort the ambitious mission, the injured botanist, Mark Watney, finds himself marooned on the Red Planet, left for dead by friends and colleagues. All alone on a lifeless rock--140 million miles away from Earth, and in the face of limited resources--the stranded astronaut must do everything in his power to survive, as unexpected satellite photos prove that Mark is still alive. Now, NASA's brilliant minds need to come up with an effective solution. Will the brave ""Martian"" return home?—Nick Riganas At the landing site of the shuttle Ares III, Acidalia Planitia, Mars, at a time in the near future, the crew of the Hermes; including Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon), IT guru Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), pilot Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), flight surgeon Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and navigator and chemist Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie); are gathering samples before re-entering their living facility, the HAB.The crew learns that a storm is approaching. The storm's intensity and high winds lead Commander Lewis to order a mission abort. Watney argues for waiting it out and brings up the rear as the crew heads toward the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle), the ship that will take them back to the orbiting Hermes, in their suits. Heavy winds and sand gusts surround them. A satellite dish breaks off and strikes Watney, knocking him out of sight of the rest of the crew. Lewis tries to guide the others to find Watney, but visibility is very poor and the storm is way too strong for them. They head back into the MAV without Watney and lift off. The pilot, Martinez, is barely able to keep the rocket from toppling but the launch from the planet is successful.Back on Earth, NASA Director Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) holds a press conference to announce that while the Hermes crew succeeded in leaving Mars, Mark Watney was lost, and he is declared dead.Watney wakes up on Mars on what is Sol 21 (mission day 21) after the storm has passed. His oxygen is depleting rapidly, so he makes his way back to the habitat station. He's been impaled by part of an antenna, which still protrudes from his abdomen; the combination of the antenna and his own blood sealed the suit just enough to keep most of his air from leaking out. In a painful procedure, Watney pulls the antenna out, uses forceps to fish out a piece that broke off in the wound, then staples the wound shut.He sits down to make a video log, where he outlines the situation: he's alive, but he can't contact Earth or Hermes; it'll be four years before the next manned mission is launched; and with the food supply in the habitat meant for him and the other five crew members, he has almost a year's worth of food, or a little longer if he rations. Therefore, Watney determines that he has to grow three years' worth of food on a planet where nothing grows. Luckily for him, he's a botanist and devises a plan to grow potatoes.At NASA in Houston, Texas, Sanders has just returned from a memorial service for Mark Watney, where he spoke about Watney's dedication to exploration. Mars Mission Director Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) talks to Sanders about getting satellite time to locate Watney's body. Sanders refuses on the grounds that the satellite feeds are public and broadcasting pictures of Watney's corpse would be a political and budgetary disaster for NASA. Later, engineer Mindy Park (Mackenzie Davis) meets with Kapoor after she discovers evidence of activity in satellite photos of the Ares III site (low-resolution images apparently taken in a routine fly-by): the solar panels have been cleaned and the rover has moved. They bring in Sanders and Director of Media Relations Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig) to show them that Watney is still alive.A few sols (Martian days) later, inside the habitat, Watney has planted potatoes using Martian soil and vacuum-sealed packets of the crew's feces as fertilizer (to his disgust). Needing more water for the potato crop, he burns hydrazine rocket fuel; a byproduct of the reaction is water. On his first attempt to ignite the hydrazine, he causes a moderate explosion, singeing his clothing and hair. Watney notes that this explosive tendency is the reason that NASA does not use pure hydrogen. As he continues to work on his food supply, he keeps going with the video logs and decides to use a rover to make it to the Schiaparelli crater that will be the landing site for Ares IV in four years. Since the battery-powered rover can't cover the whole distance, he modifies it, adding solar cells and an extra battery. To conserve battery power, the pod of plutonium used to get the crew to Mars in their original spacecraft serves as a heat source in the cabin.Watney uses the rover to find a Pathfinder probe that stopped transmitting in 1997; he hopes to use it to get in touch with NASA. He digs the old probe out of the sand, spreads its solar panels to charge the batteries, and discovers that it still works. Using hand-written signs for the Pathfinder's camera, he is able to send a message to NASA confirming that he is alive. Kapoor is able to receive the message because he and colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), who built the Pathfinders, have pulled another Pathfinder out of storage, rounded up the engineers who worked on it, and got it working again. They manage to communicate with Watney, first by panning the Mars Pathfinder's camera to point at 'yes' or 'no' signs when Watney asks if his signal is being received, and then by panning around a hexadecimal clock that Watney has scratched out on the ground around his Pathfinder. NASA uses this system to tell him how to hack the rover's operating system so it can transmit text back to Earth. When Watney, finally able to type his messages chat-style, asks how the Hermes crew took the news that he wasn't dead, Kapoor regretfully tells him that the crew hasn't been told. Watney responds with obscenities (which are broadcast all over the world).Watney's story becomes a worldwide sensation. His communications with NASA are logged, and at the request of PR Director Annie Montrose he uses the Pathfinder's camera to take a spacesuited selfie (in a two-thumbs-up Fonzie pose) which Montrose doesn't like because she can't see his face. Kapoor reminds her that Mark can't remove his helmet near the camera, which is outside the HAB.Meanwhile, the crew aboard Hermes has spent the last couple of months quietly flying back toward Earth while keeping in touch with their loved ones. The flight director of Ares III, Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean), contacts the crew and informs them that Watney is alive, and that NASA has kept it from them for the last two months so as to not distract them from their mission. The news only makes them angry and guilt-ridden, but Henderson tells them that Watney has stressed repeatedly that it wasn't their fault and they had reason to believe that he was dead.The folks at NASA determine that they can reach Watney by Sol 868. The food he's growing plus the rations in the HAB will run out in a bit over 900 days. Sanders frets that the margin of error is too small.Back on Mars, things begin to go bad for Watney when the habitat's worn-out airlock explosively decompresses, throwing the airlock some distance while he's inside it and causing his helmet to crack and leak. He uses duct tape to seal the cracks and stumbles back to the habitat to discover his potato crop frozen and dead. With less food, he now figures he can last only a little more than 300 Sols, or slightly longer if he rations.NASA and JPL work overtime and quickly launch a probe to resupply Watney. To make their launch window they bypass routine inspections, and moments after launching, the probe's trajectory shifts severely and it swerves off course and explodes. Meanwhile in China, two directors from the Chinese National Space Administration, Zhu Tao (Chen Shu) and Guo Ming (Eddy Ko), witness the explosion and discuss helping NASA by offering their classified booster rocket technology to launch a supply craft. Guo Ming asks Zhu Tao why NASA has not already asked for their help and Zhu Tao reminds him that it is a top secret program that NASA would not have any knowledge of. They decide that in the interests of international scientific co-operation, they will contact NASA and offer their booster rocket.Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) an eccentric and absent-minded but brilliant astrodynamicist, devises a plan to accelerate the returning Hermes around Earth, gaining a gravitational boost and sending it back to Mars to get Watney. The Chinese rocket will resupply the Hermes for its extended voyage. Sanders vetoes this plan because it risks the lives of the five Hermes crew members and will extend their mission by hundreds of days, but Henderson secretly sends the plan and Purnell's course calculations to the crew. The crew talks it over; they understand that the surreptitious arrival of the plan means that NASA brass have rejected the idea. They assume that if they go back to Mars, the two military members, Lewis and Martinez, will be court-martialed for mutiny and the three civilians will never be allowed to fly another mission. Lewis calls for a unanimous vote, and they all agree to go back for Watney. Johanssen hacks the Hermes computers to prevent NASA from taking control and they change course, sending a cryptic message to Houston: ""Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man.""Sanders is angry with Henderson, who he assumes sent the plan to Hermes. Henderson doesn't deny, but will not confirm his actions either. Sanders explains that his priority is for NASA to keep flying, but Congress is very sensitive to public opinion and the bad publicity that would result if Purnell's plan failed would likely reduce NASA's budget for years to come. He asks for Henderson's resignation when the mission is over. Then he's forced to announce that NASA is sending Hermes back to Mars to rescue Watney.Seven months pass on Mars. Watney has lost a lot of weight, has grown a lot of facial hair, and his teeth are rotting. He's started losing hope in his survival and rescue. He records a video log asking Commander Lewis to let his parents know of his fate. NASA sends him instructions to make extensive modifications to the rover, which Watney bemusedly performs. He packs up the rover and leaves the Ares III site; having spent 461 sols there; and heads for the Ares IV MAV, which was dropped on Mars well ahead of the Ares IV mission. It's a 3200-kilometer drive across a trackless and inhospitable Martian landscape. He stops every day for 13 hours to sleep and re-charge the rover's batteries with solar panels. During his excursion, he reasons that Mars is legally international waters; that is, it's subject to maritime law because it can't be claimed by any country on Earth. As he has not gotten explicit permission from NASA to take the MAV, and cannot get permission until after taking off, commandeering the MAV will make him a space pirate. He would like to be called ""Captain Blondbeard."" Mark also pontificates about how he's the first person to see the Martian landscape that he travels across and seems to be quite in awe of it.After the Hermes has swung around Earth and collected the supplies, they travel back to Mars. NASA and the rest of the world watch with anticipation; with 12 minutes' delay, no one on Earth can help by radio. Watney has to remove 5000 kg of weight from the MAV to make it light enough to reach Hermes' orbit. He jettisons most of the seats, all the navigation and control systems, and replaces the nose-cone airlock, a crucial structural piece and the single heaviest component, with a tarp.Martinez, flying the MAV by remote control, launches Watney into orbit. The MAV comes up too low to reach the Hermes spaceship. Vogel constructs a quickly-made sugar and oxygen explosive to blow the front hatch and cause escaping air to slow the huge ship down so they can match speeds and still get to Watney. Lewis herself decides to use the EVA MMA suit with a tether to reach Watney, but she can't get close enough. Watney punctures the palm of his glove to propel himself toward Lewis with the escaping air jet. (""Like Ironman!"" he says gleefully.) He has very little control, so he misses her. However, he runs into the tether, which his momentum causes to wind around himself and Lewis, and the crew is able to reel them in. Lewis announces to NASA that they have Watney, and people all over the world cheer. (Crowds have gathered in Houston, Times Square, Beijing, and elsewhere, anxiously waiting to hear whether the rescue worked.) The crew hugs Watney and jokes about the stench resulting from his lack of showering for many months.Back on Earth about one year later, Watney begins Day 1 as an instructor to aspiring astronauts. He tells them of his struggle on Mars, confirming that he did in fact grow food using his own excrement and humorously says he doesn't want to discuss that aspect of the mission again. He tells them that if things should go south for them, they can either accept their fate or start solving problems, because that's how you survive; by overcoming one problem after another.During the closing credits, we see the characters years later as they watch the launch of Ares V, in which Martinez is the commander. Kapoor, Montrose, Park, and Sanders watch from NASA along with Guo Ming & Zhu Tau. Henderson is retired and golfing with his son. Lewis watches at home with her husband, while Vogel is at home with his family. Beck and Johanssen have gotten married and watch from the hospital with their new baby."
Cinderella,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1661199/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When her father unexpectedly dies, young Ella finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother and her scheming stepsisters. Never one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger. A girl named Ella (Cinderella) has the purest heart living in a cruel world filled with evil stepsisters and an evil stepmother out to ruin Ella's life. Ella becomes one with her pure heart when she meets the Prince and dances her way to a better life with glass shoes, and a little help from her fairy godmother, of course. A live-action retelling of the classic fairytale about a servant stepdaughter who is abused by her jealous stepmother and stepsisters after her father died. Forced to be a servant in her own house, through it all she did not let anything or anyone crush her spirit. Then one day, she meets a dashing stranger in the woods.—gmorato Ella is living a great life until her mother dies. Ella's father remarries a ""good"" woman with two wretched daughters. One day Ella's father goes on a journey and never returns because of his death. Ella gets stuck living with her ""family"" until she rides in the woods and meets a Prince. The Prince holds a ball expecting to see Ella there. The stepmother admits her jealousy and locks up the girl, whom she calls Cinderella, in her attic room. In a far off kingdom, beautiful Ella lives a happy and carefree life under the watchful eye of her equally loving father even after her mother tragically passed away. But when her father dies unexpectedly, Ella is left in the hands of her evil stepmother and stepsisters. Though she has to work all the household chores, Ella keeps the promise to stay kind and courageous, especially when she meets a haggish woman who happens to be her fairy godmother and falls in love with a mysterious Kit, who in reality is the prince.—Blazer346 In a beautiful kingdom, a little girl called Ella (Eloise Webb) lives a happy life in a lovely manor house with her doting parents. Her father (Ben Chaplin), a wealthy merchant, is often away on business trips, but always makes the most of his time with his family. Ella's mother (Hayley Atwell) encourages her to believe in magic, courage, kindness, and hope. Ella considers the resident farm animals to be her dear friends, and talks to them often.Ella and her father are grief-stricken when Ella's mother falls gravely ill. On her deathbed, she tells her daughter that power and magic stem from kindness, and to always ""have courage and be kind.""Over the next several years, Ella (now Lily James) carries on a comfortable life with her loving father, though they both miss her mother terribly. When her father announces his plan to remarry, Ella gives him her sincere blessing and hopes for his happiness in this new chapter of his life.Ella's new stepmother, Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) is a stately widow with two daughters of Ella's age: Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera). The three women, along with their ill-tempered cat Lucifer, move into the manor house with Ella and her father. Lady Tremaine proves to be a prideful and cold woman with rather unsavory friends, while Anastasia and Drisella bicker constantly and only seem to bond over their disdain for Ella.Ella's father prepares to depart on another business trip, and asks Ella and her stepsisters what presents they would like him to bring back. While Anastasia and Drisella ask for parasols and lace, Ella merely requests the first branch that brushes her father's head as he travels. He bids her a loving farewell the following morning.No sooner had her husband departed, Lady Tremaine manipulates Ella into giving up her bedroom to Anastasia and Drisella. Ella is then relocated to the attic, where she finds that her mouse friends also reside. Despite this unjust development, Ella remains optimistic and continues to live by her mother's mantra: ""Have courage and be kind.""Some time later, Ella is given tragic news by a local farmer: her father had taken ill and died on his journey. The farmer gives Ella the branch she had requested, along with his condolences. Ella is heartbroken. Lady Tremaine is also upset, but for solely financial reasons. Resentful of her new husband for leaving them with no source of income, she takes out her rage on her stepdaughter. After dismissing all the household servants, Lady Tremaine shifts the entire workload to Ella, who is so miserable that she views the endless chores as almost welcome distractions from her grief.Ella's days of servitude grow increasingly dismal, as the shock of her father's death wears off and she realizes she no longer has a loving family. After a particularly cruel and hurtful incident (during which her stepfamily dubs her with the infamous nickname ""Cinderella""), Ella rides her horse into the nearby woods to calm herself down. She encounters a stag, fleeing from an approaching hunting party, and her horse takes off in fright while Ella clings on for dear life . Her plight is noticed by the young prince (Richard Madden), out hunting with his men, who manages to stop her horse and introduces himself as Kit, an ""apprentice"" from the palace. While Ella is charmed by the handsome stranger, whom she does not recognize as the king's son, she scolds him for hunting a helpless animal and requests that he refrain from harming the stag. While taken aback at Ella's odd request, Kit is smitten with her compassionate spirit, but is called back by his hunting party before he can learn her name.Back at the palace, Prince Kit tells his father, the King (Derek Jacobi) about the pretty girl he met in the woods. While the King still insists that Kit must marry a princess for the good of the realm, he sympathizes with his son's desire to break the occasional tradition. However, as the King is growing increasingly ill, he believes that Kit must marry quickly and properly in order to take the throne in the near future. Kit reluctantly agrees to his father's wishes, which are seconded heartily by the king's right-hand man, the Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsgard), but suggests that the entire kingdom be invited to the upcoming palace ball instead of merely the nobility and upper-class. The King agrees, and Kit looks forward to possibly seeing Ella again. The captain of the royal guard (Nonso Anozie), who is also Kit's friend and confidante, encourages Kit's progressive thinking in spite of the King's opinions.As Ella buys groceries in the market square, the royal crier (Alex MacQueen) announces to the gathered public that a grand ball will soon be held at the palace so the prince may choose a bride, and that all eligible ladies in the kingdom are invited. Having never been to such a luxurious affair and hoping to see Kit the ""apprentice"" again, Ella is excited to learn that even the serving class is welcome to attend. She rushes home to relay the news to her stepfamily, who are overcome with anticipation. Lady Tremaine immediately plans for one of her daughters to win the prince's hand and bring riches to the family again. When Ella expresses interest in going to the ball, she is scoffed at and dismissed. Ella, still not disheartened, finds an old dress of her late mother's and begins to mend it herself in preparation for the event.On the evening of the ball, Anastasia and Drisella are decked out in their new gowns and are aflutter with excitement. Lady Tremaine is delighted that she has ""two horses in the race,"" and is all but convinced that the family will soon be elevated to royal status. Ella descends the stairs in her mother's old dress, taking one more stab at attending the ball. Lady Tremaine and her daughters cruelly rip the dress to tatters, taunting Ella and forbidding her to accompany them. As the three women depart, Ella runs into the garden, weeping with rage and sadness.Ella is startled by an old beggar woman crouching in the corner of the courtyard who asks for a bit of nourishment. Despite her own misery, Ella kindly offers the woman a bowl of milk. To Ella's great surprise, the old lady transforms into a shimmering fairy and introduces herself as Ella's fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). The fairy godmother wastes little time in transforming a pumpkin, Ella's mouse friends,a goose, and some lizards into a spectacular carriage, four while horses, a coachman, and footmen, respectively. Ella's ragged pink dress is spruced into a magnificent blue ball gown, and her worn-out shoes are replaced with a stunning pair of glass slippers. Ella is dumbfounded by her change in luck and is most grateful, but is warned by her fairy godmother that the spell will be broken at the last stroke of midnight and all will be as it was before. Ella promises to be home in time, and is sent off to the palace after receiving a charm that will prevent Lady Tremaine and the stepsisters from recognizing her.The ball is just underway as Ella arrives, with scores of princesses being introduced to the Prince and the King. When Ella appears on the ballroom balcony, the assembly goes silent and Kit recognizes the girl from the woods at once. He asks her for the first dance, which she gladly accepts, and the party officially begins. While Lady Tremaine sends her daughters into the fray to compete for the Prince, Kit and Ella sneak away to the castle grounds. Realizing that Kit is, of course, the Prince, Ella is a bit shocked, but upon getting to know him, sees he is an honest and caring man. He speaks of his inner conflict between pleasing his father, whom he loves and respects, and pursuing his own ambitions. Though having a marvelous time with Kit, Ella notices the clock beginning to strike twelve and hastily excuses herself. In her rush to leave the palace before the magic wears off, she loses one of her glass slippers on the palace steps. Kit sends the royal guard after her, determined to find out who she is, but Ella's goose coachman manages to evade them. At the last stroke of midnight, Ella's dress, coach, and attendants all return to their normal forms, although her one remaining glass slipper remains intact. She walks the rest of the way home, still giddy from her magical evening.When her stepfamily finally arrives home, Ella is still in a wonderful mood as the stepsisters talks of the beautiful ""mystery princess"" who stole the show at the ball. Lady Tremaine is angry after overhearing the Grand Duke say that the Prince was already promised to the Princess of Zaragosa, so the whole ball had been for naught. She is also suspicious as to why Ella is so cheerful after such a supposedly unpleasant evening alone at the house.The King is nearly dead, and finally gives Kit his blessing to marry for love, encouraging him to find the beautiful girl from the ball. Kit thanks his father and bids him a tearful farewell. Once made king, Kit immediately sends his men out to find the mystery princess so that he may marry her. All eligible women in the kingdom try on the glass slipper that Ella left behind on the palace steps, but it fits none of them.Having learned of the kingdom-wide sweep for the mystery princess, Ella rushes to her attic room to retrieve her remaining glass slipper, which she had hidden under the floorboards with her other treasured belongings. She is startled to find her stepmother waiting there for her, tauntingly displaying the slipper in her hand. Lady Tremaine finally reveals to Ella the source of her resentment: Lady Tremaine's first husband, whom she had married for love, met a premature death that forced his wife into the trials of single motherhood. After marrying Ella's father, she was left in the same predicament after his death. Despising the fact that she had to constantly look upon the beloved child of another man who had left her, Lady Tremaine channeled her rage and frustration onto Ella. Having deduced from the discovery of the slipper that Ella is the sought-after mystery princess, Lady Tremaine dashes the slipper to pieces against the wall and locks Ella in the attic alone.Lady Tremaine brings the remains of the slipper to the Grand Duke as proof that Ella, her ""servant girl,"" is the mystery girl whom Kit loves. The treacherous Grand Duke, while feigning loyalty to Kit, had concocted a scheme with Lady Tremaine in order to force Kit to marry the Princess of Zaragosa: Lady Tremaine will keep Ella away from Kit, and in return will receive the title of Countess and prosperous marriage arrangements for her two daughters. Despite this plot, the Duke pretends to honor the new king's wishes by attending the royal guard as they search for the mystery princess.The last house in the kingdom to be visited by the royal guard is Ella's but she is still locked in her room when they arrive. Lady Tremaine shows the Captain and the Duke into the house, where Anastasia and Drisella unsuccessfully try on the intact glass slipper. The men prepare to leave, but are halted by the sound of singing from an upstairs window. Ella, in an attempt to keep her spirits up, is singing the lullaby her mother sang to her as a child. Lady Tremaine and the Grand Duke attempt to send the guards quickly on their way, but are shocked when one of the uniformed soldiers reveals himself to be King Kit in disguise. Kit orders the Captain to find the source of the singing.Lady Tremaine has no choice but to lead the Captain upstairs to Ella, but initially refuses to let Ella leave. The Captain reminds her that it is on the order of the King that Ella come downstairs. Lady Tremaine makes the shockingly false excuse that, as Ella's mother, she is only doing what is best for the girl. Ella angrily asserts that Lady Tremaine is not, and never will be, her mother. Ella follows the Captain downstairs.In the drawing room, Kit and Ella face each other as they truly are: a young king and a kindhearted farm girl. They promise to accept each other as they are. At last, Ella tries on the glass slipper, which fits perfectly and confirms her identity once and for all. Anastasia and Drisella, realizing their stepsister will soon be queen, make hasty apologies for their behavior, but Lady Tremaine is frozen with rage on the stairs. Before leaving the house with Kit and the guards, Ella offers her stepmother forgiveness.With their wicked plans found out, Lady Tremaine, Anastasia, Drisella, and the Grand Duke are all banished from the kingdom. Ella and Kit are married, excitedly embarking on their new life together, with portraits of their respective late parents hanging side by side in the palace. The fairy godmother recounts how they went on to be kind, just, and beloved rulers, and that Ella continued to see the world not as it was, but as how it could be."

The next day, as Tanner takes Bond to Q's lab by the river, he informs Bond about the impending demolition of the old MI6 building after the bombing by Silva; a sleek glass building across the river was erected as the replacement for the British Intelligence. C is pushing for greater surveillance, purely digitized as he deems human agents obsolete and slow. Recent terror attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia are pushing government opinion in C's favor and the initiation of the Nine Eyes program will allow preemptive security against global terrorism.In Q's lab Bond is injected with a nanochip code-named ""Smart Blood"" to track him as a precaution after his actions in Mexico, Q also provides Bond a watch fitted with an explosive. Bond asks Q to help him disappear, which Q is loathe to do, however he does disclose that the Smart Blood is experimental and they will experience signal loss two days after transmission for a twenty-four hour interval. Moneypenny finds a thank you present from Bond on her desk and Q enters his lab to find the Aston Martin DB10 assigned to 009 missing. In its place, Bond has left a bottle of champagne.Bond has taken the Aston Martin to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral, his widow, Lucia, is there. Bond follows her home and eliminates two hit men sent to kill her, she is ungrateful however as more will try again, she is to be killed for knowing too much about her husband's business. Bond however beds her to get whatever information he can; Marco was part of a global criminal syndicate, he leaves her but not before sending a message to his CIA friend Felix Leiter to get her to safety. Bond heads to a syndicate meeting gaining admittance with Marco's ring, various terrorists and criminals from all over the world are discussing their progress, with shares in human and drug trafficking, furthermore, the Nine Eyes program is their idea to counteract investigations against them and C is one of their number with the terror attacks to convince the world to permit Nine Eyes. The silhouetted leader appears whom everyone fears and respects, a number is asked to assassinate the Pale King, one loyal member volunteers, another steps forward for the position, Mr Hinx, a silent and strong man. He eliminates his opposition with ease and is given the mission.The leader speaks, he knows James is there and where he's standing and even knows him personally, referring to him by the nickname ""Cuckoo"", Bond flees, Mr Hinx gives chase, they drive through the streets of Rome, Bond calls Moneypenny on the phone, she's uncovered the identity of the Pale King, the assassin known as Mr White/Quantum from Bond's previous missions, last seen in Austria. He asks another name examined, Franz Oberhauser, long believed dead. Bond escapes Hinx with backwards firing flamethrowers to blind his view and launching from the car in an ejector seat as the vehicle steers into the Tiber. Moneypenny searches the name Oberhauser, all she finds is a twenty-year old newspaper article on a father and son presumed dead in an avalanche.In Tokyo C is pitching the Nine Eyes program to other countries, a vote is called, only the South African representatives refuse, the program is denied as it must be decided by unanimous vote, Tanner reads a news headline on the car chase in Rome which makes he and M worry that Bond has left without permission, M calls Q to confirm Bond's location, he is in Altuassee, Austria, Q has to lie that he's in Chelsea, London.Bond has traced Mr White to a remote cabin fitted with cameras where he is in hiding and terminally ill from thallium poisoning. His boss poisoned him as punishment for deserting the syndicate, Mr White believed they'd gone too far. Bond can tell he's protecting someone, his daughter, he offers to protect her in exchange for the mastermind's location, Bond offers up his Walther as a sign of his word, White aims the gun at Bond and gives a name ""L'Americain"" along with his daughter's location, the Hoffler Clinic and shoots himself.In London C gives M a tour of the new intelligence building, M asks if C has ever had to kill another human, the latter doesn't respond and plays the recording of Bond and Moneypenny's phone call, M is worried over C watching MI6 agents. Mr Hinx finds White's cabin and discovers his corpse and a surveillance camera showing his final moments. Bond arrives at the clinic, Mr White's daughter is a psychiatric and fitness doctor, Dr Madeleine Swann. Swann reads through Bond's form to evaluate, the final question asking what his occupation is which is left blank, Bond confesses he's an assassin, Swann is fearful that he's there to kill her, he denies it along with killing her father, and that he made a promise to him, when he references L'Americain Swann throws him out. At the clinic bar Q approaches Bond, he insists that Bond return to England and that Franz Oberhauser is dead, Bond knows otherwise, he asks Q to analyze the ring, Q heads off to the Pevsner hotel while security sees Bond off the premises, he resists when he spots Hinx and his goons abduct Swann.They drive off in a convoy of jeeps and Bond chases them in a plane, more goons corner Q on a cable car and he escapes through a crowd. Bond crashes the convoy and saves Swann, the latter is enraged as it's likely Bond led them to her, he convinces her to follow him to Q. At the hotel Bond clarifies to Q that Swann knows about the organization and Q discloses his findings, Franz Oberhauser is alive and is the leader of the criminal organization Bond is pursuing and all the villains of the Bond's past missions were members, Swann knows the organization is named Spectre, as her father was one of them. Q switches on the T.V. to show a terror attack in Cape Town, Bond advises Q go back to London while he looks for L'Americain, Swann says it's a place, a hotel in Tangier.It was where Mr White spent his honeymoon and he visited it every year, Bond ransacks the place looking for clues, he finds nothing save a bottle of alcohol, Swann says she dissociated herself from her father and his criminal profession and goes to sleep. In the middle of the night Bond wakes up and sees a mouse scurry into a hole in the wall, he finds a secret room behind it, inside is an assortment of contraband including a tracking console to locate Oberhauser's phone. A list of co-ordinates on the wall point to empty desert in North Africa.In London M hurries to Whitehall and learns that the South Africans have accepted Nine Eyes after the terror attack, the program launches in under 72 hours. C is elected head of the committee and the 00-program is terminated per the Home Secretary's orders. Bond and Swann take a train across desert to the supposed location of Oberhauser, back in London Moneypenny and Q show M satellite photos of a lair in the African desert which shows Bond is going, M says they cannot help him as C will spot it, Q is ordered to delete the Smart Blood data as safety, Bond must go it alone.Bond and Swann drink a toast on the train which is interrupted by a surprise attack from Hinx, he and Bond battle to the cargo car, Hinx nearly throws Bond out of the door, he's stopped when Swann shoots him in the arm with Bond's gun. Hinx attempts to strangle Swann, Bond wraps a rope around Hinx's neck with a hook at the other end attaching it a canister which Bond kicks off the train dragging Hinx out with it. Bond and Swann arrive at an abandoned station in the middle of the desert, after a lengthy wait a chauffeur driving a 1948 Rolls Royce Silver Wraith collects them and they are driven to Oberhauser's base in a crater. They are taken to separate rooms, in Bond's room is a framed photograph of him with his foster father Hannes and brother Franz, whom Bond recognized in Rome. In Swann's room is a framed photo of her as a child with her father. They are called to meet Oberhauser, he takes them to a large surveillance room and shows Bond live footage of M announcing his departure to MI6, then he reveals all of Bond's tragedies he faced through his career where orchestrated by him, then he plays footage from White's cabin of Bond negotiating with White and White's suicide.Bond is knocked out and taken to an operating room where Oberhauser is explaining torture to Swann, that the best method is to infiltrate the human mind, where the soul is. He demonstrates this on Bond who is restrained in a mechanical chair and drills bore into strategic places in his skull. Oberhauser explains that his father took Bond in after the loss of his parents and grew attached to him, Franz felt resentful, feeling that Bond was invading, comparing him to a cuckoo bird, when a cuckoo hatches in the nest of another bird it forces the other eggs out. Franz murdered his father and faked his own demise taking the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the surname taken from his mother's bloodline. Bond slips his watch loose and hands it to Swann and instructs her to arm the bomb and throw it across the room to Blofeld, and explosion releases Bond from captivity, he and Swann escape with Bond shooting most of the guards and triggering a gas explosion that destroys the entire lair.In London Bond summons M, Q, Moneypenny and Tanner to a secret location to inform them of C's Spectre association and the danger of Nine Eyes, they drive to C's intelligence center, Bond and M are in the front car which is driven off the road, Bond is taken hostage while M escapes and hops into the rear car.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381249/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ethan and his team take on their most impossible mission yet when they have to eradicate an international rogue organization as highly skilled as they are and committed to destroying the IMF. CIA chief Hunley (Baldwin) convinces a Senate committee to disband the IMF (Impossible Mission Force), of which Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is a key member. Hunley argues that the IMF is too reckless. Now on his own, Hunt goes after a shadowy and deadly rogue organization called the Syndicate. After an excoriating official US government review of its history of questionable missions with high stakes and considerable collateral damage, the IMF is disbanded. Regardless, Ethan Hunt is undeterred from his personal mission to stop a sinister counter-organization to the IMF, the Syndicate. Now a fugitive from the CIA, Hunt secretly calls his colleagues together to accomplish that, which soon also involves a mysterious woman who has an agenda of her own with those criminals. With both sides playing deadly complex games of intrigue, Hunt and his team must take even more risk with difficult options to protect the world.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) IMF agent Ethan Hunt is looking for a group of rogue agents known as the Syndicate. When Ethan foils one of their operations, they capture him. Ethan escapes because one of them, a woman, helped him. Ethan then contacts Brandt but Brandt tells him that IMF has been shut down. So Ethan goes out and tries to find them on his own. Months later Brandt and Benji are working at the CIA under the man who shut down IMF, Hunley. Benji gets a trip to Vienna and when he goes he meets Ethan. They attend an opera wherein the Chancellor attends. Ethan sees that someone is about to shoot the Chancellor but he stops him but he sees the woman who helped him there too and with a gun too but she helps Ethan. The Chancellor is evacuated but when he gets in his car it explodes. The woman who says her name is Ilsa tells Ethan who the leader of the syndicate is and Ethan lets her go. Ethan then goes to try and find him. Hunley upon learning if what happened in Vienna and thinking Ethan is involved tells Brandt to get him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Ethan is labeled as a rogue agent after the IMF is disavowed by the CIA. The CIA believes that the Syndicate is a figment of Ethan's imagination so they try desperately to take him in. Meanwhile, the Syndicate grows stronger and a British Secret agent who is undercover as a member of the Syndicate, joins with Ethan and his team to take down the Syndicate at last.—Brandon B Impossible Missions Force Agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) is directing two members of his team, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), in an attempt to retrieve a package from a cargo plane that's about to take off in Minsk, Belarus. Luther is connecting Benji to the plane's electronics by hacking a Russian satellite, which is likely to get them into trouble -- and Brandt reminds them that they're already under investigation for misconduct. As the plane rolls onto the runway, Benji finds that most of the plane's systems are secured -- he can't shut down the fuel pump, the electrical system, or the hydraulics. Just then the missing member of the team, IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), sprints over a hill by the runway and leaps onto the plane, demanding that Benji open the plane's door. By the time Benji gets the right door open the plane is up and away, but Ethan escapes with the package -- many canisters of toxic nerve gas, conveniently prepared for a parachute drop.The nerve gas was being sold to a terrorist group, but none of the people who sent it from Belarus had the means to obtain it. Ethan is convinced this trail will lead him to the Syndicate, an international criminal consortium whose very existence has been in doubt. Reporting to an IMF substation that's disguised as a London record shop to receive his next orders, Ethan is captured by the Syndicate and watches in horror as a Syndicate agent kills his contact. He wakes up in a torture chamber, where he observes some discord -- Syndicate operative and disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who's preparing to interrogate Ethan with drugs, is forced to step aside by her colleague Janik Vinter (Jens Hultén). He's called the Bonedoctor and has a case full of scary instruments to prove his right to the nickname. Ethan escapes with help from Ilsa, but she refuses to go with him.Meanwhile, Brant appears with CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) before a Senate oversight committee. Brandt must respond to every question by refusing to confirm or deny anything without permission from the secretary (of defense, presumably) ... which he cannot get because there is, at the moment, no secretary in office. This allows Hunley to have his way with the committee. At his request the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA, guaranteeing that Ethan -- who Hunley thinks has gone rogue -- will be captured within the day.Six months later, Ethan is still on the run. Unable to find the Syndicate without help, he enlists his former colleague Benji, who's happy to take a break from the CIA -- Hunley is sure Benji knows how to find Ethan and subjects him to weekly polygraphs (which Benji beats handily). Ethan arranges for Benji to attend Turandot in Vienna to search for Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who Ethan suspects is the leader of the Syndicate. Although Ethan and Benji thwart three snipers at the opera (one of whom is Ilsa), the Austrian chancellor (Rupert Wickham) is killed by a car bomb. Ethan reveals to Benji that the Syndicate has been assassinating minor world leaders for some time; the murder of the chancellor of Austria is an escalation and a signal that the Syndicate is stepping out of the shadows.Brandt recruits Luther to help find Ethan and prevent Hunley's team from killing him. Using a likeness of Ilsa left by Ethan, Brandt and Luther are able to track Ethan, Benji, and Faust to Morocco, where they're infiltrating a secure server underneath a power station. Their target is a well-protected ledger containing the names of all Syndicate agents and information on where the Syndicate keeps its money. The three of them execute an elaborate scheme in which Ethan is nearly drowned. As soon as he starts breathing again, Ilsa whacks Benji and takes the drive holding the ledger. During the ensuing chase, Brandt and Luther catch up with Ethan and Benji, while Ilsa joins a team of Syndicate motorcycle goons just long enough to get a bike of her own. Ilsa manages to escape, but Benji reveals he had already made a copy of the data.Ilsa returns to London and attempts to pass the drive containing the Syndicate ledger to her handler, MI6 Director Attlee (Simon McBurney), who compels Ilsa to return to the Syndicate and finish her mission. She returns to Lane, only to find that Attlee has wiped the drive, which in fact contained an encrypted ""red box."" A red box is a data safe programmed by the British government; unlocking it requires the prime minister's biometrics. The former IMF agents confront Ilsa, but when Lane's men abduct Benji, Ethan and company are told they must deliver a decrypted copy of the drive to Lane.Brandt contacts Hunley and reveals their location. At a charity auction, the two try and prevent Ethan from attacking the prime minister, whom they and Attlee take to a secure room. Ethan, having posed as Attlee, reveals himself and has the prime minister confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a classified project to perform missions without oversight (though the prime minister insists that he cancelled the project while it was still in the planning stages). When the real Attlee arrives, Ethan subdues him and he admits that he had been covering up the existence of the Syndicate since Lane hijacked the project and went rogue.Luther discovers the file actually contains access to billions of pounds. Ethan memorizes the data and destroys the file to force Lane to release Benji and Ilsa in exchange for what he knows. He goads Lane, drawing him into the open and luring him into a bulletproof cell where he is taken into custody. Ilsa drives away, telling Ethan, ""you know how to find me.""Some time later, Hunley and Brandt return to the oversight committee, where Brandt once again refuses to confirm or deny anything without permission from the secretary. Hunley secures the reinstatement of the IMF, claiming that his previous efforts to have it disbanded were all to allow Hunt to go undercover. The committee, though skeptical, approves, and on the way out Brandt addresses Hunley as ""Mr. Secretary."""

In order to clear their name and regain their status, the Bellas take on a seemingly impossible task: winning an International competition no American team has ever won. In order to accomplish this monumental task, they need to strengthen the bonds of friendship and sisterhood, and blow away the competition with their amazing aca-magic! With all new friends and old rivals tagging along for the trip, the Bellas can hopefully accomplish their dreams once again.—Chris Greenleaf In order to regain their status after a humiliating event in front of the President, the Bellas enter to win the World Championship against the top a cappella groups. However, since NO American team has ever won before, the Bellas stand up for the challenge. Three years after winning the previous competition, the Barden Bellas are now led by senior Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick) and three-time super senior Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow). The Bellas have become ICCA champions each of these three years. However, the group becomes involved in a national scandal, dubbed Muffgate, when Fat Amy Hobart (Rebel Wilson) accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Obama during a performance on his birthday at the Kennedy Center, showing her genitals to the public since she did not wear underwear, leading to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated should they win the World Championship of a Capella.. In the opening scene of this sequel to the previous film, the Barden Bellas are performing at an a cappella tournament with the Obamas in attendance. Now led by Beca (Anna Kendrick), the Bellas - Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Chloe (Brittany Snow), Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), Jessica (Kelley Jakle), Ashley (Shelley Regner), and the newest addition Flo (Chrissie Fit) - come out in sequined outfits performing ""Timber"". Commentating the event once again are John and Gail (John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks). Fat Amy comes out hanging from a silk sheet singing ""Wrecking Ball"", when she is suddenly swung upside down and her outfit rips. She spins around and gives the crowd a great view of ""down under"".The incident becomes nationwide news, and the Bellas are called in to see the university's dean. Due to the ""Muffgate Incident"", the Bellas are suspended from performing in any a cappella showcase or competition. Their best bet of getting back in is to compete in an A Capella World Tournament. John and Gail laugh them off since no U.S. team has won because everyone hates the U.S.A freshman named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) walks to a musical orientation with her mom Catherine (Katey Sagal), who was once a Bella herself. Emily hopes to follow in her mother's footsteps, despite their recent troubles. She goes to the auditorium to see an a cappella performance from the Treblemakers, co-led by Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Benji (Ben Platt). They put on a good show for the audience, and Emily later meets Jesse and Benji outside, where Benji immediately develops a crush on Emily. He tries to talk to her and says he wants to put her in a box and saw her in half...for magic. Jesse says he's seen him do worse.Beca secretly starts an internship at a recording studio. She sits in with other interns as the boss (Keegan-Michael Key) tells them that Snoop Dogg is going to record a Christmas album with them, but he is looking for something fresh to add over all the other Christmas albums put out. One intern, Dax (Shawn Carter Peterson), suggests a dumb idea about Snoop performing with dogs...for obvious reasons. The boss makes Dax take a lap around the office in his skinny jeans.Chloe registers the Bellas to compete for the Worlds in Copenhagen. Emily stops by their house to personally audition for them, and the ladies become interested after learning that Emily's mom was a pioneering Bella, making Emily a Legacy Bella. Emily performs a song that she wrote called ""Flashlight"". The Bellas like her, despite some reservations, and they officially make her a Bella. They take Emily to a party of a cappella students. Beca finds Jesse, who is the only one that knows about Beca's internship.The Bellas go to a car show that they would have performed at before their suspension so that they can check out the team that has replaced them. They are the dominating German team, Das Sound Machine, co-led by Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) and Pieter (Flula Borg). DMS performs an epic rendition of ""Uprising"". They approach the Bellas after the show to make condescending remarks, though Beca finds herself sort of attracted to Kommissar.At work, Beca watches her boss as he records Snoop Dogg singing ""Winter Wonderland"". The boss is frustrated at not finding anything good to add to this, until Beca steps in and volunteers to tweak with the beat player and then starts singing ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" alongside Snoop. The boss likes what he hears, and he asks Beca to show him whatever else she's working on.Beca goes back to the house to find the ladies pillow-fighting. She brings them a fancy invitation to the Bellas for an exclusive a cappella riff-off. The Bellas go to the house where the riff-off is held, and they find the Treblemakers there, along with DMS, the Tone Hangers, which now include Bumper (Adam Devine), and even the Green Bay Packers. Kommissar and Pieter taunt the Bellas again before the competition starts. The first category is ""Songs About Butts"". The Treblemakers get cut when singing ""Baby Got Back"" because Benji trails off after catching a glimpse of Emily. The next one is ""Country Love"", which ruins the Packers since Clay Matthews doesn't know where to start. The Tone Hangers lose after ""I Dated John Mayer"" when Bumper sings the wrong song. Finally, the Bellas and DMS compete in ""90's Hip Hop Jamz"" and lose when Emily starts to awkwardly sing her song. The other Bellas are disappointed.Beca's boss is unimpressed with what she brings him since it's mostly mash-ups. This, coupled with the Bellas' recent embarrassments, hurts her confidence. Fat Amy goes into Beca's room and tries to help boost it, admitting that she knows about the internship since she saw her badge after sneaking into her purse.Bumper brings Fat Amy into the bodega with a dinner he's prepared, and he asks her to be his girlfriend since he wants to do more than just hook up. Fat Amy declines as she does not want to be tied down. She leaves Bumper disappointed.The Bellas go to put on a performance at a country club as a sort of practice before the Worlds. They braid their hair and do a medley of ""Promises"" and ""Problem"", with some props and effects to go with it. Sparks go off, and Cynthia-Rose's hair catches fire, causing another bumbled performance.Chloe decides to bring the ladies to a retreat center run by their old comrade Aubrey (Anna Camp). The point is to help the Bellas get their sound back. Aubrey subjects them to several group exercises and activities. Beca becomes frustrated, prompting Chloe to ask her why she's been acting odd lately. Fat Amy makes Beca admit to the internship, but she also adds that she's the only one in the group that's thinking of the future beyond being a Bella, unlike Chloe who didn't graduate with Aubrey and stuck with the Bellas. They argue, and Beca walks away right into a net trap that pulls her up into the trees. She gets cut down by Lilly since she sleeps upside down like a bat.At night, the ladies have chilled out and are roasting marshmallows. Beca says that after college, she won't remember performing, but she'll remember her Bella sisters. Chloe decides that she'll finally graduate and teach children to sing...or exotic dancing. They all sing ""Cups"". Then Fat Amy starts to say what she'll do later on, until she realizes that she is in love with Bumper. She runs off to her man, until she also gets caught in a trap.Fat Amy rides a paddleboat back to campus to find Bumper where they sing ""We Belong"" to each other. They then start making out on the field, to the horror of the Treblemakers.Beca helps Emily record her song with some of Beca's beats. They show it to the boss, who says he doesn't like it since he feels he could do the same but he thinks the two of them have potential and he is willing to work with them.The Bellas graduate and head off to Copenhagen for the Worlds. Before the show, Benji finds Emily and is about to do a magic trick when she instead kisses him. As the show starts, the other competing teams sing their own renditions of ""Any Way You Want It."" DMS goes up to do a kick-ass medley of ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark"" and ""All I Do Is Win"", complete with fire effects. The Bellas are up next, and they perform ""Run The World (Girls)"", ""Where Them Girls At"", and a special performance of Emily's ""Flashlight"", with a surprise appearance from other former Bellas, including Aubrey and Catherine. The audience waves the flashlights that Benji passed around, and they love the Bellas. Kommissar and Pieter shake their heads, knowing that they've been beaten. The Bellas become the new World Champions.When the ladies get home, they give Emily a proper Bella initiation. The last step is to christen the house by sliding down the stairs. Fat Amy demonstrates and tumbles down the stairs hard, but she gets back up on her feet quickly. Emily then takes her turn.During the end credits, we see Bumper performing ""All of Me"" on ""The Voice"". He gets Blake Shelton to turn around until he starts acting weird and makes him turn back around. Bumper keeps performing his heart out and gets Blake to turn back around, along with Adam Levine, Pharrell, and Christina Aguilera. Bumper picks Christina to be his coach, and he goes to give her an uncomfortable hug."
The Revenant,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663202/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team. While exploring uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary frontiersman Hugh Glass sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.—Jwelch5742 Set in 1820s America, fur trapper and Frontiersman Hugh Glass struggles to survive the harsh winter after an oppressive Ree Indian attack and a mauling from a hostile maternal bear. Abandoned by his crew, Glass attempts to cross the bleak wasteland with only a single notion set in his mind; Revenge. In the untamed and unforgiving wilderness of mid-winter snow-capped Missouri, the experienced nineteenth-century tracker, Hugh Glass, and his son, Hawk, lead a hunting and trapping expedition in the uncharted territory of the fierce Indian tribe, Arikara. As the party of trappers struggle to navigate back to the distant Fort Kiowa, a swift and devastating attack by a formidable grizzly bear leaves a brutally mauled Glass on the brink of death, double-crossed and abandoned by his men. Now, only Hugh's rabid desire to live can help him survive the piercing cold and the grave dangers in one of the world's most inhospitable environments, giving him the strength to drag his unrecognisable carcass and exact his revenge. However, will the man who has returned from the dead taste the ambrosial fruit of retribution?—Nick Riganas 1823, half-blood Hugh Glass guides Captain Andrew Henry's company trappers party through the present-day Dakotas. While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk hunt, the company's camp is attacked and decimated by an Arikara war party which seeks its Chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. The surviving trappers escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, who is questioned by some trappers, they next reach on foot Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver would make them vulnerable. After docking, they stashes the pelts. While scouting game, Glass is mauled by a grizzly bear and left presumably dying. Trapper John Fitzgerald fears another Arikara attack, argues they must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry offers money for two men to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies: the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, yet Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts. After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk, whom he soon after fatally steps while Bridger is gathering water, stabs Hawk to death . Fitzgerald convinces unsuspecting Bridger that the Arikara are approaching, so they must abandon Glass. Bridger ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave, leaving his canteen. Later Fitzgerald admits the lie. When they meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Glass begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude cauterization of his wounds, eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into rapids and teams up with Pawnee refugee Hikuc, sharing bison meat. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in it, Glass emerges as his wounds are healing but Hikuc has been hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and frees raped Powaqa, kills several hunters and recovers Hikuc's horse. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives by eviscerating the horse to shelter in its carcass. A French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes his spiral engraved canteen as Glass's, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger, but Glass vouches that he was not present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk and was later deceived and threatened by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. After Glass and Henry split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills and scalps Henry. Glass finds Henry's corpse, places it on his horse as a decoy, shoots Fitzgerald in the arm and pursues him Fitzgerald to a riverbank where Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara (who found Powaqa) spare Glass. Glass retreats into the mountains.—KGF Vissers Set in an indeterminate year of the 1820s, the opening scene shows Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) speaking to his son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) in an Indian language (Pawnee), telling him that even though he is scared and wants his trouble to be over, he must fight as long as he can grab a breath. As we hear Glass' voice, we see images of Glass with his Pawnee wife and son, his home being set on fire, and him holding his wife in his arms.Glass and Hawk are walking through a river with other men from their hunting party as they stalk elk. They are camped by a river in rural Missouri with other fur-trappers. They are led by their captain, Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). A naked missing man from their party walks into the settlement and collapses forward with an arrow in his back. Another man is shot in the neck with an arrow and falls into the campfire. The hunting party is attacked by a tribe of local natives who are Arikara Indians, also known as 'Ree'. The men fire back with their rifles. Glass is attacked and nearly choked to death, but one of his men rescues him. A few men gather their furs and materials toward a boat to make their escape. The Arikaras themselves are looking for the chief's daughter, Powaqa, stolen by unknown white men.The men abandon their boat and start to hike overland to Fort Kiowa. Hawk is antagonized by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) for his race (Hawk is half-Indian on his mother's side), but Glass quickly defends his son and tells him not to retaliate against Fitzgerald.While hunting in the woods, Glass comes across a grizzly bear and her cubs, and he is quickly attacked by the larger bear. The bear claws and bites Glass, throwing him around as Glass tries to defend himself. He manages to shoot the bear, but it doesn't kill her. She attacks again and Glass gets his knife, stabbing it several times as they both tumble down a hill. Glass lands in a gully and the dead bear lands on top of him. The men later find Glass and try to tend to his deep wounds.Meanwhile, the Arikara warriors continue their search for Powaqa. They come across French fur traders and trade the riverside furs for five horses.The men in the hunting party carry Glass on a makeshift stretcher, but he only slows them down. They attempt to carry him up a hill, only for him to slide and bring the other men down. Fitzgerald suggests they need to just kill Glass and put him out of his misery. Henry covers Glass' eyes and almost shoots him in the head, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Henry offers payment of $75 to anyone who will stay behind with Glass. Hawk and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) volunteer, though Fitzgerald points out that they and Glass will be likely to die. Henry raises the payment offer to $100 so that even Fitzgerald decides to stay with them until Glass expires.Glass is still in great pain and continues to have visions of his wife and the day his home was burnt down.Fitzgerald gets a moment alone with Glass and tries to convince him to let him put him out of his misery so that no one else is slowed down or left waiting to die, including Hawk. As Glass is unable to talk, Fitzgerald suggests Glass should blink if he agrees, knowing that Glass would eventually have to blink, with or without intention to agree to Fitzgerald's offer. Glass holds his eyes open for a long time before closing them, instead of blinking. Fitzgerald intentionally interprets this as blinking and starts to smother Glass. Hawk shows up, seeing Fitzgerald smothering his father. Hawk starts to call Bridger for help, leading to a struggle with Fitzgerald in which the man stabs Hawk in the abdomen, then letting him bleed out as Glass watches helplessly. Fitzgerald gets rid of Hawk's body and tells Bridger he doesn't know where he went.Later that night, Fitzgerald urges Bridger to move on with him, claiming to have seen Ree Indians by the creek. Already having dug a grave for Glass, Fitzgerald forcefully drags him into the hole and partially buries him alive under a pile of dirt as Bridger reluctantly lets him do so.Meanwhile, Henry and the rest of the hunting party have a difficult march by as they head towards Fort Kiowa. As Fitzgerald and Bridger head to meet them, Bridger realizes Fitzgerald was lying about having seen the Ree by the creek. He turns his rifle on Fitzgerald, who takes it from Bridger and turns it on him. He pulls the trigger, but the unloaded rifle clicks on an empty chamber. They continue to move.Glass awakens and weakly struggles to rise from out of the dirt. He starts crawling his way through the woods to find food and warmth. He finds Hawk's body freezing up from the cold. Glass vows to stay by his son's side. He finds a thick bear pelt to take with him to keep warm. As he continues to move through the woods, he feeds off of roots and old bone marrow. He attempts to build a fire for added warmth and uses some of his leftover gunpowder to seal the wound in his throat. Nearby, the Indians are getting closer, so Glass rides down the rapids to escape them.Fitzgerald and Bridger are still walking. They come across a burnt-down settlement with bodies sprawled across the ground. One woman emerges from her burnt hut and sees the men. Bridger quietly leaves some food for her.Glass is getting colder and hungrier. He walks into the river and eats a live fish. He walks up a hill and sees a Pawnee Indian feeding off the carcass of a bison. Glass approaches him cautiously and gestures for food. The Indian throws him an organ, which Glass eats ravenously. In the morning, the Indian observes the bear wounds on Glass' body, which are starting to rot. Glass says his men left him for dead and killed his son. The Indian states that his own family was killed by a rival Sioux tribe. He is seeking out more Pawnee.Fitzgerald and Bridger reach the outpost and rejoin their party. Fitzgerald tells Henry that they couldn't save Glass or Hawk, and he collects his payment. Bridger remains quiet but is upset and refuses a bonus pay.Glass and the Indian move forward. They spend the evening sitting and catching snow in their mouths, the first time Glass has looked peaceful in a while. The Indian gathers materials for a quick sweat lodge and places a feverish Glass inside. Glass starts hearing his wife's voice, and then sees himself walking toward Hawk before they embrace in an old church. The Pawnee performs a healing ritual for Glass' wounds.When Glass wakes up, the Pawnee is gone. A short time later he sees that the Indian has been hanged by the French fur trappers. He infiltrates their camp and witnesses one of the men raping a woman. It is Powaqa (Melaw Nakehk'o). Glass holds the rapist at gunpoint and frees Powaqa. Glass then takes a horse, letting the other horses loose. He rides to a spot in the woods where he builds himself a fire.In the morning, the tribe searching for Powaqa starts to attack. Glass holds them off with his rifle before he mounts his horse and rides away. The tribe follows him on their horses up to a cliff where Glass and his horse fall over the edge. The horse dies, and Glass is injured again. As the night falls and the cold intensifies, he cuts the horse open, removes its organs, and bunks inside its carcass for warmth. When he wakes up, he gets out of the carcass and moves to a snow cave. In there, he carves ""Fitzgerald killed my son.""Sometime later at the outpost, one of the French hunters arrives with Glass' canteen, which Bridger left on the dirt pile after Fitzgerald buried him. Thinking he took it from Hawk, Henry leads a search party through the woods. There, they find Glass, limping towards them. They bring him back to the outpost. Henry finds that Fitzgerald is gone. The French hunter tells him that he heard Fitzgerald was headed to Texas. What's more is that Fitzgerald cleaned out the party's payroll safe. Henry then confronts Bridger with his rifle and beats the young man to the ground and puts him in the stockade.Glass vouches for Bridger's innocence to Henry, stating that he was only following orders. He also tells Henry how he saw Fitzgerald kill his son. Hearing that Fitzgerald is heading for Texas, Glass requests that he seek the man out himself. Henry reluctantly agrees to have Glass join him in the hunt.The two encounter Fitzgerald and split up to get him from opposite sides. Henry finds Fitzgerald first and plans to bring him back to be tried for murder. The two men draw their guns on each other, with Fitzgerald killing Henry. Glass finds Henry's body and puts him back on top of his horse using a branch as a prop. They ride on in view of Fitzgerald, who fires his rifle from a distance. He thinks he's killed Glass, but he just shot Henry's body. Glass gets a shot off and wounds Fitzgerald who runs while Glass pursues. They corner each other in the woods, and Fitzgerald shoots at Glass. Fitzgerald runs down by the creek where Glass finds him and they begin to fight. Fitzgerald nearly stabs Glass, but Glass turns the knife on him. Fitzgerald impales Glass' hand, but Glass overpowers him and nearly finishes him off until Fitzgerald states that killing him won't bring his boy back. On the other side of the creek, Glass sees the Indians that have been pursuing him, now with Powaqa. He decides that revenge is in God's hands, so he pushes Fitzgerald into the water and lets him float over to the Indians. The chief grabs Fitzgerald and kills him with his knife. They spare Glass since Powaqa tells them that Glass freed her.Although he has gotten his revenge, Glass is alone once again, wandering through the cold land. He falls on his knees and sees a vision of his wife once again walking into the light. The final shot is of Glass' eyes filling up with tears."

Later some ants bring him the suit and he puts it on and gets out of jail. He then goes to the man who says he's Hank Pym the man who created the suit. He used it before and called himself Ant-Man. He gave it up when he found out people were planning to use his technology for things he doesn't think is right so he made sure no one could replicate it and put it away. But he now needs Scott to be Ant-Man because it seems like his protégé, Darren Cross, who forced him out of his company, is close to replicating it. So he wants Scott to get into the lab and take it.

When he steals a powerful suit, he quickly returns it only to find himself arrested again. But a mysterious man named Hank Pym has other ideas for him. Pym explains that it has the power to shrink in size and increase in strength due to a special formula called the Pym Particle. He was once its owner and called himself Ant-Man. Unfortunately during his SHIELD days, Pym discovers that others wanted to replicate his design. Now Pym wants to use Scott to being the new Ant-Man because his former apprentice Darren Cross is working to replicate the formula for his own evil purposes.

Waiting to pick him up is his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Peña), who offers to let him stay at his apartment. Scott is unable to find a legitimate job with his criminal record. He had found out that the company he worked for had been overcharging their customers, so he hacked into the system and transferred millions of dollars back to the customers. Luis introduces him to Dave (Tip 'T.I.' Harris), a getaway driver, and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), an identity theft specialist. Luis has a tip about a robbery they could do together.Hank gets invited to a presentation at the company he founded, Pym Tech. He runs into his daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and his former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who shows him a prototype of the Yellow Jacket suit, modeled after the Ant-Man suit that Hank wore. Darren has not had success at shrinking living tissue.Scott borrows Luis' van and drops in on the birthday party of his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). He runs into Cassie's soon-to-be stepfather, Officer Jim Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) , who is not happy to see him. His ex-wife, Maggie (Judy Greer) tells him that he has to find a legitimate job and pay off his delinquent child support before she'll allow visitation with Cassie. Jim and his partner, Gale (Wood Harris) insist that Scott leave the party after saying goodbye to Cassie.At Pym Tech, Hope and Darren are trying to shrink sheep to microscopic size. Their experiment fails, and a sheep is killed. Darren insists they press forward with another sheep.Scott realizes that it will be more than a year before he can see Cassie again if he takes a minimum-wage job, so he takes up Luis on his offer. Luis' cousin, Ernesto (Nicholas Barrera) had a friend, Emily (Lyndsi LaRose), who was a housekeeper and was dating Ernesto's friend, Carlos (Carlos Aviles). She told Carlos that the man whose house she was cleaning has a giant safe that's sure to be holding valuables. Scott agrees to help them with the robbery.Luis picks up supplies for the break-in, and Kurt steals a communication technician's uniform. That night, Kurt climbs up a pole outside Hank's house and blocks the electrical circuit, cutting off all phone communication. Scott climbs the fence and takes out the window sensors, then pries open a window and heads to the basement. He unlocks the basement door only to find a second door that is fingerprint-coded. Using tape, he lifts Hank's print and opens that door. When he gets to the safe, he realizes that he'll need some ingenuity to break the steel door. He drills small holes around the lock, then squirts in water and uses nitrogen to freeze it. The frozen water warps the steel and causes the bolts to shoot out. When he opens the safe, the only thing inside is a weird-looking body suit and helmet. He grabs that and heads out. Meanwhile, Hank has been watching the whole episode upstairs.Dejected at not having gotten anything valuable, the group heads back to Luis' apartment. Scott goes into the bathroom and examines the suit he stole, wondering why it was so heavily guarded. He notices tubes full of red and blue liquid. Out of curiosity, he puts it on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror. Noticing a red button on the glove, he pushes it and instantly shrinks, becoming a half-inch tall. Luis comes into the bathroom and he turns on the water in the tub, which is like a tidal wave for tiny Scott. He hears a voice coming from an earpiece in the helmet. He tries pushing a blue button to return to normal size, but it's broken. Panicked, he jumps away from the water and finds himself sailing across the room. He lands in a crack and falls through to the apartment below.In that room, there's a party going on, and Scott realizes he's on a record player, with the needle moving toward him. He jumps free and lands on the floor where people are dancing. Avoiding the giant footsteps, he gets under the door and into the hallway, where he is promptly sucked up into a vacuum cleaner. When the dust bag gets emptied, he jumps again, this time landing on a rat. He runs away, but lands on a mouse trap. When it's triggered, it sends him flying out through a window and into the rainy night. He sees raindrops as big as his head, before landing on a car. The impact jarred the blue button free, and he grows back to normal size.Scott races home and takes off the suit. Realizing that someone had been tracking him all along, he decides to return the suit to Hank's safe. He easily breaks into the house again and puts the suit back. But when he gets out, he's surrounded by cops. He is arrested and brought to prison, where Paxton is waiting for him. Gale tells Paxton that Scott's lawyer is there. Confused, Scott goes to see the lawyer that he hadn't asked for and doesn't know.The ""lawyer"" waiting for him is Hank. He offers Scott two choices: life in prison or follow his instructions. Scott is thoroughly bewildered, so Hank tells him that he allowed him to steal the suit. Scott is taken back to his cell, and an army of ants brings him back the suit. He puts it on and shrinks, and then quickly escapes from the prison. One of Hank's ants spreads its wings, and Scott climbs on and flies over the city.Hank tells Scott that he invented the suit, but was afraid it would be misused, and so he had locked it away. Darren had found out about the shrinking technology, but when Hank wouldn't give it to him, Darren forced Hank out of Pym Tech. When Hope realized how dangerous Darren was, she teamed up with Hank to stop him. Hank tells Scott that he needs him to become ""Ant-Man"" to stop people like Darren. Scott realizes he has a chance to become a true hero, the kind of father his daughter deserves.Scott gets trained in martial arts and how to lead the ant colonies. He practices his timing with shrinking and growing back. Hank tells him that one piece of technology he'll need to steal the suit from Darren is in an abandoned SHIELD building. When Scott flies to the building, he sees that it's the current Avengers' headquarters. Pressing forward, Scott lands on the roof, triggering a sensor. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) arrives to investigate, and he can see Scott even at small size. A battle ensues, with Scott going inside Falcon's jet pack and causing it to short out. Scott escapes with the equipment he needs.When Scott returns, Hank explains the truth about how Hope's mother died. There was an ICBM that had been launched at the U.S., and Hank was trying to stop it, but even at ant-size, he couldn't get inside. She had a similar suit, called the Wasp. She decided to shrink to sub-atomic size and was able to stop the missile, but she couldn't return from that size and was lost in the quantum realm.Darren Cross finally has success at shrinking a lamb. He envisions himself taking over Pym Tech. He invites Hank to the grand unveiling, then calls Hope and tells her that he has increased security, including covering all the vents with microscopic mesh. They realize the job will be harder than they thought, and they'll need more people. Luis, Kurt and Dave are brought in. Luis poses as a security guard and lowers the water pressure so Scott can get in through the pipes.Scott plants explosives throughout the building, but when he tries to steal the suit, he gets caught in a glass cage by Darren, who had anticipated the burglary. Darren plans to sell the technology to HYDRA. Scott breaks free and takes out the Hydra agents. Darren gets into a chopper on the roof and escapes just before the building blows up. Hank and Hope break out by turning a tiny tank to full-size, and ride it out the side of the building.Darren puts on the Yellow Jacket suit, and he and Scott fight inside the helicopter. After they both fall out, Scott is able to trap Darren inside a bug zapper, but Jim Paxton shows up to arrest him before he can destroy the suit. Darren goes to Jim and Cassie's house and threatens their lives, hoping to draw Scott in. Scott arrives and they fight. The only way Scott can get inside Darren's suit is to shrink to sub-atomic size, and he causes Darren to shrink into nothing.Lang is trapped in the Quantum Realm, but hearing Cassie's voice, he manages to rewire the suit, reversing the process and returns to normal size. Following the battle, a grateful Paxton covers for Scott so he would not have to go back to prison. Hank wonders if Hope's mother is also still alive somewhere. Luis tells Scott that the Falcon is looking for him.In a Mid-Credits Scene: After Lang's departure, Pym shows an upgraded prototype of the Wasp Suit to Hope, offering it to her. To which she replies, ""it's about damn time"".In a Post-Credits Scene: Captain America and Falcon have the Winter Soldier in their custody, and are trying to figure out what to do next. Unable to tell Iron Man due to the ""Accords"", Wilson says he knows who to contact for help."

He then plugs in Tip's brain to help him get an idea of where to find Lucy. They trace her location to Australia, where she is actively looking for her daughter. Tip hugs Oh for this. The other Boov then find the two and try to ""erase"" Oh. Tip messes with the gravity manipulation system and causes the whole Tower base to tilt upside down.

Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get the car up and running.Tip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip starts to run for her mother, but Oh tries pulling her toward the mothership for safety. Oh claims that Lucy is on the ship, but Tip knows he's lying. She gets angry at him for trying to break the promise again, and she declares that they were never friends. Heartbroken, Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg come close to the Boov ship as they flee in terror. Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's plan. Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he's the captain. Oh defies him and says he's a bad one since everything he told them about humans was a lie. Smek orders he be erased, until Kyle steps in and defends Oh. He grabs Smek's ""shusher"" (a scepter thing with a rock on it) and gives it to Oh, stating that he should be the new captain. Although uncertain at first, Oh knows what he has to do first.Tip goes everywhere she can to find Lucy, but nobody can help her. Defeated, she sits in a corner and cries. Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. The Gorg mothership then descends upon the planet. Oh realizes that they want the rock on the shusher, since Smek stole it from them before. Oh runs to the ship to try and get it's attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car to avoid them getting in trouble. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg's face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg halts the ship as it mows down the ground, with Oh in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but it appears that Oh gets crushed beneath the machine. It starts to pull back, and Oh is unharmed. Tip and Lucy run to Oh and hug him. The Gorg emerges from the ship, and Oh returns him the rock. The Gorg emerges from its armor to show that it's a harmless starfish-type creature. Inside the rock are the next generation of Gorg, as this Gorg is the last of his kind. He thanks Oh and departs. Oh becomes a hero to both humans and Boov.Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time. We then see that other Boov, including Smek, are partying on the moon, while other ships from other planets head to Earth for Oh's party."

What will be Mavis' final decision?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After the unforeseen love affair between species inHotel Transylvania (2012), the isolated monster resort is now open to human visitors. With Mavis and Jonathan now happily married--and their adorable five-year-old son, Dennis, still not showing signs of vampiric transformation--the worried grandpa, Count Dracula, decides to take matters into his own hands, trying to make sure that the boy will follow in his footsteps. With this in mind, the undead relative organises an exciting road trip along with his ghoulish friends, to help Dennis get a proper education; however, this is easier said than done. Is the curly-haired grandson, indeed, a late-bloomer?—Nick Riganas It's Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Johnny's (Andy Samberg) wedding day. Dracula (Adam Sandler) is worried that she'll decide to move out of the hotel, but he decides to keep it together for her sake.One month later, Johnny tells Dracula that Mavis wants to go flying with him. They play a game of hide-and-seek, but Mavis quickly gets winded. She tells him that she can't fly very far, since she's pregnant.Dracula is overjoyed that he's going to be a grandfather, until Mavis mentions that it's possible her child will be a human. When the due date arrives, Dracula sneaks into the delivery room disguised as a nurse. He swears that no one will ever harm his grandson, before handing him to Mavis.On Dennis' (Asher Blinkoff) first birthday, there is a party, and Johnny's parents, Mike (Nick Offerman) and Linda (Megan Mullally) are invited. Also at the party are Frankenstein (Kevin James) and Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shannon), Griffin (David Spade), and Murray (Keegan-Michael Key). Dracula is convinced that Dennis will grow up to be a vampire, even when Linda points out that he doesn't have any fangs. Wayne tells her that he has until his fifth birthday to have his fangs grow in. Mike tells Johnny he should get a job, but Dracula bails him out by saying that he already has a job at the hotel, making the humans feel more comfortable there.Months later, Mavis calls for Johnny and Dracula and tells them that Dennis said his first word. Dennis says ""Bleh bleh bleh,"" then repeats it over and over again. Not amused, Dracula checks inside his mouth for any sign of growing fangs, finding nothing.When Dennis is four, Dracula tries to teach him how to turn into a bat. Dennis is only able to flap his arms and run around the room. Dracula tells Dennis that he'll dance for him if Dennis will try to turn into a bat. Mavis comes in and asks what they're doing. Dracula mentions that six of Wayne's pups are having a birthday party, but Mavis doesn't want Dennis to go, since they play too rough with him. Dracula asks her if she doesn't want Dennis around monsters, and Dennis says he wants to watch his favorite video, Kakie the cake monster (Chris Kattan). Mavis points out that he hasn't yet shown any signs that he's not human.Mavis reluctantly brings Dennis to the party, and a girl pup named Winnie (Sadie Sandler) tells Dennis she loves him and they will get married. Dennis squirms away from her. Mavis is overjoyed by all of the fun things at the party, such as limbo and a piñata, though she wreaks a bit of havoc when she breaks the piñata and the werewolf pups eat the candy. In the chaos that ensues, Dennis gets knocked to the ground and one of his teeth falls out; Mavis is horrified, but Dracula excitedly rushes to see if Dennis' fangs are going to come in. She tells Dracula that she and Johnny have been talking about moving to California, so that Dennis can grow up around other humans; she still doesn't think that her son will manifest any vampire powers before his fifth birthday.Saddened, Dracula goes to see Johnny in his room. Johnny tells him that he loves it at the hotel, and doesn't want to move. Dracula tells him to take Mavis to his parents' house, while Dracula will watch Dennis. His plan is to have the monsters show their skills, so that Dennis will decide to turn into a vampire. He only has one week left before Dennis' fifth birthday.Johnny and Mavis fly away, and moments later the monsters pull up. Together, they all drive off with the Blob riding sidecar in an attached Rascal scooter. Johnny and Mavis land in Santa Cruz and rent a car. Dracula and the group arrive at the forest, and he tells Frankenstein to show Dennis how he scares people. Two joggers pass by and see him, but they aren't frightened. Instead, they ask if he will take a picture with them, which he happily agrees to do. Dracula then tells Wayne to kill a deer, and he starts to chase after one, but gets distracted when a frisbee flies by. He quickly chases and grabs the frisbee, to Dennis' delight. Angry, Dracula drives the group away, and the scooter becomes detached, sending the Blob over a cliff. Dracula says he'll be fine, since he's shapeless.Johnny and Mavis are driving through Santa Cruz, and she asks him to stop at a minimart. She gets fascinated by the potato chips and Slurpees. It's Murray's turn to try and impress Dennis, and Dracula tells him to conjure up a sandstorm. Murray starts chanting and twisting, but then he hurts his back, only producing a small sand pile that Dennis happily plays with. Johnny and Mavis see a park where kids are doing bicycle stunts, and Johnny borrows a kid's bike to show off his tricks. Mavis decides to give it a try, and is able to do floating loop-de-loops and stop in midair. They leave for Johnny's parents' house, and Mavis decides to check in on Dennis.Dennis is fast asleep when Dracula's phone rings, and he doesn't want her to know that they left the hotel. Griffin puts his sunglasses on Dennis, and moves his arms and talks for him so Mavis won't see that he's asleep. Dracula decides that he will have to teach Dennis himself. He drives them to the Vampire Summer Camp where he spent his childhood. The camp director meets them and says that Dracula was a legend as a kid. The vampire children are all eating mice.Johnny and Mavis arrive at Mike and Linda's house, and find the guest room made over with a makeshift coffin. Mavis thinks it would be a great place to raise Dennis. Linda announces that she's invited other human-monster couples over.Dracula takes Dennis and the group to the top of a 200-foot tower, and he throws Dennis off, thinking that he'd figure out how to fly before he hit the ground. One by one, the monsters look over the side and announce that he's still not flying. When he gets close to the ground, Dracula flies down and grabs Dennis. Frankenstein leans on the side of the rail, causing the tower to fall over and land in the campfire. Frankenstein is set on fire, and he runs wildly through the buildings, setting them all on fire. A tree falls and crushes the hearse.Johnny and Mavis are on the roof, and she tells him that she doesn't want Dennis to grow up in Transylvania, and end up being a freak like her. Johnny says that he'd be overjoyed if Dennis grew up to be curious and full of life like she is. His phone rings and he shows her a video that he thinks a friend sent him. She recognizes that it's Dennis falling off the tower. Frantic, she calls Dracula. Sirens are blaring as firemen try to put out the fire. Dracula answers the phone and tells her that they're still at the hotel. Dennis grabs the phone and starts to tell her that Dracula was teaching him how to fly, but Dracula smashes the phone before he can finish. Mavis tells Johnny that they have to head back to the hotel right away.Dracula realizes he has to get back to the hotel quickly, but they don't have a car. The Blob rides up on his scooter, and they all leave. Mavis decides that it will take too long to fly back on a plane, so she turns into a bat and grabs Johnny, then flies off. The Blob gets stuck in traffic, and Mavis flies through a raincloud and gets sopping wet. When the traffic clears, the Blob has to pull off the road and duck behind some bushes. Mavis flies through a thunderstorm, dodging lightning bolts. Frankenstein blows the Blob up like a balloon, and then lets go, causing him to shoot forward with them. They race a train, narrowly beating it through a tunnel. Dracula holds Dennis up in the air and lets him pretend to fly.Mavis and Dracula arrive at the hotel at the same time, and she shows him the video of Dennis falling, which has gone viral. Angrily, she tells him that she'll have his birthday party there, and then they're moving to California.The night before the party, Mavis tells Dracula that she invited his human-hating father, Vlad (Mel Brooks). Dracula pulls Johnny aside and tells him that Vlad can't know that he and his family are humans, or he'll eat them. Johnny decides to make the party a costume party. Everyone is dressed as monsters, and Johnny is wearing a cheap vampire costume. Vlad arrives with the demon Bela (Rob Riggle), and Dracula tells Frankenstein to keep him away from Mavis and the humans. Brandon, the actor who played Kakie, shows up as a performer. Vlad meets Johnny and thinks he's a freaky-looking vampire. When Vlad meets Dennis, he wants to see his great-vamp-son's fangs; when he has none, he thinks he's a ""late-fanger,"" just as Dracula was, and tells them that all they have to do is scare Dennis' fangs out of him. Kakie sets up to start his act, and Vlad makes him levitate. Mavis notices Vlad offstage and wonders what her grandfather is doing. Vlad makes Kakie's costume head spin, and then makes him act possessed. Dennis jumps into Dracula's arms. Vlad makes Kakie's body shape-shift. Dracula stops him, saying that it's not worth it. Mavis asks what's going on, and Dracula says that he was trying to scare Dennis into growing fangs. Johnny says they were desperate, and she realizes that he was in on it. All of them, along with Johnny's parents, start arguing. Upset, Dennis runs off, and Winnie follows after him.Winnie leads Dennis to a dog fort. Bela sees them and calls out more demons. Mavis and Johnny realize that Dennis isn't there, and everyone at the party runs off to try and find him. Bela swoops into the fort and grabs Dennis and Winnie, who bites his hand. Bela flings her away, causing her to crash on the ground. This enrages Dennis enough for his fangs to come in, and his vampire powers manifest immediately.Dracula, Johnny, Mavis and the rest of the monsters join in the fight, driving the demons away. Unseen, Bela grabs a sharp branch and flies straight at Johnny, trying to kill him. Just in time, Vlad, having had a change of heart, stops Bela and shrinks him, warning his former minion to never come near him or his family ever again.Mavis decides to continue raising Dennis at the hotel. Since it's still Dennis' birthday, they return to the party and get ready to eat Dennis' cake. After the gremlin lady swallows the entire cake in one bite, the party resumes and everyone has a great time, even Dracula and Vlad, who dance in typical over-the-top vampire fashion."
Fifty Shades of Grey,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2322441/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Literature student Anastasia Steele's life changes forever when she meets handsome, yet tormented, billionaire Christian Grey. Anastasia Steele, an English literature major at Washington State University, agrees to interview for the college newspaper a billionaire, Christian Grey, as a favour to her roommate, Kate Kavanagh. During the interview, Christian Grey takes an interest in Anastasia. Soon after it, he visits the hardware store where Anastasia works and offers her to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Anastasia had interviewed him. Later, Grey invites her to a cafe and also sends her first edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels, including Tess of the d'Urbervilles, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card. His pursuing eventually brings a result - Anastasia and Grey start dating. In the course of their troubled relationship Anastasia slowly comes to uncover Grey's troubled past and realises that he is not good for any woman, let alone for himself. Although, she enjoys the bondage sex with Grey, she feels that she has to make a step that will take her all her strength and courage, for Christian Grey is a very dangerous man.—MischaLeCroix In Washington, the shy and naive English literature college student Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele goes to Seattle to interview the twenty-seven year-old self-made billionaire Christian Grey in his office to help her roommate Kate Kavanagh that is graduating in journalism and has influenza. When Ana meets Christian, she feels disturbed with him since he is handsome and self-confident. Soon he visits her at the hardware store where she works and invites Ana for a coffee, but he leaves her telling that he is not the man for her. On the graduation day, Christian sends first editions of romances to Ana as a gift. After the graduation, Ana, Kate and their friends go to a bar and Ana drinks too much. She calls Christian and tells that she will return the books since they are expensive and he goes to the bar and brings Ana to his hotel room. Christian dates Ana and offers a non-disclosure agreement to her to keep in secret their relationship. Ana does not sign the contract but loses her virginity with Christian that wants to introduce her in bondage since he is a dominant sadist. However Ana is seeking a romance and not sadomasochist relationship. Will they stay together?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Much to her surprise, the sensitive and guileless English major, Anastasia Steele, finds herself surrendering to an irresistible force, when an ordinary interview with the telecommunications magnate and enigmatic bachelor, Christian Grey, paves the way for an out-of-the-ordinary relationship. However, Grey's unexpected offer leads to an unusual agreement, one that will lure the incurably romantic woman into his well-hidden world. Now, little by little, Christian entices Anastasia into a sensual reality, seducing her to explore her limits in an unrestrained passion, and tempting her to embrace the cathartic feeling of being different. Above all, Anastasia wants to mend Christian's broken heart; nevertheless, for love's salted wounds, there are no safe words.—Nick Riganas Anastasia (Ana) Steele is a 22-year-old college student living in Vancouver, Washington with her wealthy best friend/roommate, Katherine (Kate) Kavanagh. They are both on the cusp of graduating from WSU, where Kate is a journalist for the college paper. She is scheduled to interview the ""enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc,"" Christian Grey, who is a benefactor of the university and will hand out the diplomas at graduation. However, she comes down with the flu and gets Ana to go to Seattle to do the interview in her place. Ana reluctantly heads to Seattle to conduct the interview and is caught off guard when she comes face-to-face with the handsome 27-year-old billionaire CEO. The interview is rather awkward with Ana being rather nervous and Christian being very intense and arrogant with his responses. We learn a few things about Christian: He is a control freak, and he is adopted, and he is not gay (apparently many people think he is because he is never seen with women despite his good looks and status). He even turns the tables and starts asking Ana questions about herself, and we get a slight sense of a flirty attraction between the two. The interview ends, and Christian sees Ana out to the elevators where they part ways.Ana feels embarrassed and foolish in the way she conducted the interview, and she is also rather smitten with Christian but ignores her feelings. We meet Ana and Kate's friend, Jose Rodriguez, who is a photographer and has a crush on Ana (though she is not interested in him in that way at all).Later in the week, Ana goes to her part-time job at a hardware store called Clayton's and is surprised when Christian walks in. He says he is in town on business and needs a few things (cable ties, duct tape, rope, etc). They exchange some friendly banter, yet Ana tries to remain professional despite being totally disarmed by Christian. Paul, the son of the owner of Clayton's, comes into the store and gives Ana a rather intense hug which immediately puts Christian off. Paul retreats and Christian and Ana discuss doing a photo shoot for Kate's article the next day. Christian gives Ana his business card and tells Ana he is glad Kate wasn't able to make the interview. Ana finally accepts that she ""likes"" Christian, but knows that it's a ""lost cause"" because of who he is.Ana and Kate arrange for Jose to take photos of Christian at the Heathman Hotel in Portland. The photo shoot goes well, and Christian asks Ana to go for coffee with him afterwards. Kate and Jose are not happy about this turn of events, and Kate even feels that there's something ""dangerous"" about Christian and that Ana is too ""innocent"" to start anything with him.During their coffee date, Christian and Ana get to know each other a little more personally. He talks about his mother Grace (a doctor), father Carrick (a lawyer), older brother Elliot (construction worker), and little sister Mia (studying cooking in Paris). Ana talks a little about her mother Carla (living with husband #4 in Georgia) and her step-father Ray (lives in Montesano, her birth father died when she was young). Christian also inquires about her romantic life, asking if she is interested in either Jose or Paul, to which she declines. Ana asks Christian if he has a girlfriend to which he replies, ""I don't do the girlfriend thing."" As he is walking her to her car, a cyclist almost hits Ana, but Christian pulls her out of the way just in time. They embrace, and she tries to kiss him, but he refuses her and warns her to stay away from him and that he is not the right guy for her. They part ways and Ana is very hurt and tells herself that she will not be seeing him again.After final exams are over, Ana and Kate plan to celebrate that night at a bar. Unexpectedly, Ana receives a package from Christian: first-edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles worth thousands of dollars. She wonders why he would send her such an expensive gift despite rejecting her. That night at the bar, Ana gets very drunk and calls Christian asking why he bought her those books. He is very surprised to hear from her, and is worried about her drunken state. She drunkenly insists on knowing his motives for sending the books while he insists on knowing exactly where she is. She vaguely tells him her location and hangs up, only to have him call back and say that he's coming to get her. Feeling sick, she goes outside with Jose, who makes a pass at her. She refuses him, and Christian arrives to break up the situation. Ana proceeds to throw up in a flower bed while Christian holds her hair back, and Jose retreats back into the bar. Christian insists on taking Ana home but makes her drink some water first. Elliot, who came with Christian, is dancing and flirting with Kate. Christian leads Ana to the dance floor, but she passes out.Ana wakes up in Christian's hotel room at the Heathman. Christian lets her know that they did not have sex, but he did undress her and sent her clothes to be cleaned because they were splattered with vomit. She showers and they discuss the events of the previous night (her drinking, Jose's advances, the expensive books, etc). He sent her the books as an apology, and because he can't seem to stay away from her despite not wanting a romantic relationship. They discuss her future plans to apply for internships and move to Seattle after graduation. She tries to tempt him to touch her, but he clearly states that he won't until he has her ""written consent"" and offers to take her to Seattle to his apartment to show her what he means by that. Extremely intrigued, Ana accepts. After breakfast, they leave the hotel, but not before sharing a passionate kiss in the elevator. Christian takes her home and says he will pick her up later that evening.At home, Ana tells Kate (who spent the night with Elliot) how things seem to be moving along with Christian. She goes to work at Clayton's and discovers Jose has been trying to contact her, but she decides to let him ""stew"" for a while. Christian picks her up after work, and they take his private helicopter, Charlie Tango, to Seattle. They arrive at his apartment building, Escala, where they have some wine, and he has Ana sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) so she can't say anything to anyone about what he is about to show/tell her. She signs and asks if Christian is going to ""make love"" to her, and he says he doesn't make love, he ""fucks."" He leads her to a room in his apartment and tells her that she can leave at any time if she wants to because what he is going to show her may scare her away. She insists on seeing what's inside the room, so they go inside to find that it is filled with all kinds of sex toys and bondage equipment.Christian explains that he is a Dominant (Dom), and he wants Ana to be his Submissive (Sub). If she agrees to this, there are rules she must follow, and she will surrender herself to him ""in all ways."" If any rules are broken, she will be ""punished."" Basically, Christian wants a BDSM (bondage dominance submission masochism) relationship where he can get off by controlling her, and she will be ""happy"" by pleasing him with her submission. Ana is taken aback by all of this; however she doesn't leave. They leave the room and discuss things further, with Christian being very business-like about everything and urging her to ask questions knowing it's a lot for her to take in. He gives her more paperwork that explains the ""rules"" of the Dom/Sub relationship and reveals he's had 15 submissive in the past. The paperwork also explains ""hard limits,"" or things that are not negotiable such as sexual acts involving children or animals, fire, breath control, etc. Ana reveals that she is a virgin, which shocks Christian. He feels foolish and just ""assumed"" she's been with men because she is so beautiful. He takes her to his bedroom to deflower her and ""make love"" by having ""vanilla sex"" (sex without toys or anything kinky). She has her first orgasm while he is only playing with her nipples. He has sex with her twice (missionary position and doggie-style), and she thoroughly enjoys every second of it.After a short sleep, Ana finds Christian playing a sad song on his piano. He says he can't sleep because he isn't used to sleeping with anyone else. They go back to his bedroom and fall asleep together. In the morning, Ana fixes breakfast for herself and Christian while thinking about everything that has happened. Christian joins her and urges her to eat all of her breakfast (he's obsessed with Ana eating full meals all the time). She speaks to Kate on the phone who tries to get details out of her about her night with Christian, but she is coy about it and hangs up. She asks Christian if it is okay for her to discuss their sex life with Kate despite signing the NDA; however she will not mention his Red Room of Pain (her nickname for the playroom of sex toys and bondage). He says he doesn't want her to because Elliot and Kate are sleeping together, and his family knows nothing about his bondage lifestyle. He also reveals that he's never had vanilla sex before and that he actually enjoyed it.They take a bath together and fool around some more. She gives him a blow job (unbelievably, an amazing one despite it being her first time doing that), and he goes down on her and has sex with her while her hands are tied together with one of his neck ties (the gray one that's on the cover of the book). Suddenly they hear voices outside the room, one of which turns out to be Christian's mother. After throwing some clothes on, they go into the living room where Christian happily introduces Grace to Ana. Grace is glad to meet her and comments on not seeing Christian for 2 weeks, and she misses him. After a brief exchange, Grace leaves, and Christian takes a business call. Ana notices Jose has called her again, much to Christian's dismay. He gives Ana the BDSM contract and urges her to read it carefully and do internet research about BDSM so she can make a fully informed decision.They leave in his Audi R8 Spyder to go back to Portland. Christian says it's okay for Ana to discuss things with Kate (short of the BDSM stuff), but to make sure she doesn't talk to Elliot. They stop at a restaurant on the way, and they discuss his sexual past and lack of regular dating/relationship experience. Christian reveals he was seduced by his mother's friend when he was 15 years old and was her submissive for 6 years. They are still good friends to this day, and his mother has no idea about any of it. Ana is disgusted that Christian was sexually abused as a teen, but he doesn't see it that way. His relationships with his past subs dissolved due to ""incompatibility"" and he feels that he and Ana are very compatible and urges her to do the research in hopes that she will sign the contact and be his. Ana seems to have some reservations about the whole thing, but Christian's allure keeps her intrigued.Christian takes Ana home, and they agree to see each other again on Wednesday. Kate is eager to know the details about Ana's first sexual experience. Ana admits she's unsure about their future as a couple saying that Christian is ""complicated."" Kate talks about how much she's into Elliot and her upcoming family trip to Barbados. Jose calls Ana and apologizes for making a pass at her, but expresses his disdain about her seeing Christian. She promises to have coffee with him sometime soon, and they hang up. Kate and Ana pack up much of their apartment, and Ana thinks about her situation with Christian, and if she wants to pursue a sexual relationship with him. After much avoidance, she gets out the contract and reads it.The contract is extremely business-like and outlines all the rules that Ana must obey, all the sexual acts that they may engage in (which may be negotiated), and exactly what is expected by both the Dom and the Sub. The Dom will financially provide for everything and make sure the Sub is in good emotional and physical condition, and in return, the Sub will submit to every need and want the Dom has. Breaking any of the rules will result in punishment of the Dom's choosing, such as whipping or spanking. Ana tries to take it all in, still having major reservations about the whole idea of being Christian's ""sex slave,"" but part of her finds the whole prospect thrilling and very hot. She goes to sleep dreaming of Christian.The next day, Christian sends a brand-new MacBook Pro to Ana, and also equips her with an email address so he can contact her. They send a few emails back and forth discussing their future date on Wednesday and questions about the contract. Ana goes to work at Clayton's and gets coffee with Jose on her lunch break. She forgives him for making a pass at her, and they are friends again. Later that night, Ana and Christian exchange some flirty emails and then Ana begins her internet research on BDSM.The next day, Ana decides to go for a run and think some more about the contract. As a joke, Ana emails Christian that she's ""seen enough"" and that ""it was nice knowing you,"" but regrets sending it worried that Christian won't see it as a joke at all. Turns out she's right, as he shows up in her bedroom not long after claiming that her email required an in-person response to remind her just how ""nice"" it was to know him. He ties her to her bed with the same gray necktie again and blindfolds her with his t-shirt. After some foreplay with wine and ice, they have sex. Afterwards, they discuss his ""indecent proposal"" and he discloses that he was ""collared"" when he was a submissive to ""Mrs. Robinson"" (this is a nickname Ana gives to the woman that dominated Christian years ago, obviously a reference to ""The Graduate""). He offers to introduce her to some of his former submissive, but she immediately refuses and is put off by the notion. He accuses her of being jealous, which upsets her and she asks him to leave. He gives her a passionate and romantic kiss before leaving and says to Ana ""What are you doing to me?"" He leaves and Ana starts to cry, struggling with the fact that she has strong feelings for him, but she is afraid of getting hurt if she agrees to be his submissive. Kate comforts her and says that he seems to have commitment issues. She also informs Ana that her dad called while she was with Christian to tell her that her mother can't make graduation because her husband, Bob, has a minor injury.Ana emails Christian her comments and concerns about the contract, including the following: why can't she masturbate, why can't she touch him, she's not on board with being ""punished"" physically, she refuses to eat from a ""food list"" he has provided, etc. After some emails back and forth, she goes to bed feeling troubled.The next day, Ana calls her mom to discuss Bob and how she won't be able to see Ana graduate, which Ana is okay with. She and Christian email back and forth some more, with him confirming their date for 7pm the following day which he will pick her up for. She insists on driving herself and meeting at Escala, to which he reluctantly obliges. Ana calls her step-father, Ray, and realizes how much she can't wait to see him at her graduation because he's always treated her like his real daughter and they have a special bond. Ana and Kate pack up their apartment some more and go to bed.The next day, Paul shows up at Clayton's during her shift and asks her on a date. She refuses him and makes it clear that she is seeing Christian Grey, much to his disappointment. Later, she drives to Escala and meets up with Christian at the bar. They sit in a private dining room and immediately get into a discussion about the contract. He tells her that she can walk away anytime she wants to, but once she goes, that's it. This pains her to hear. They eat oysters, and he compromises with her on several contract issues, assuring her that they will take it slow because he knows she is inexperienced. They flirt, and she realizes that if she stays any longer, they will wind up having sex in the dining room. She gets up to leave, and he embraces her and pleads with her to spend the night with him, but she refuses which frustrates him. The valet brings Ana's car around, and Christian is appalled that she is driving an old Beetle which he feels is very unsafe. She assures him that she's fine with it, and they part ways. When she gets home, she reads an email from Christian saying that he hopes she will take him up on his offer because he really wants to make it work with her. She goes to sleep, once again, crying.Ana has an erotic dream about Christian involving a braided leather riding crop. She wakes up and vaguely tells Kate about her evening. Kate reads Ana her valedictorian speech while trying to get her mind off of Christian. Ray arrives, and they go to the graduation. She sees Christian there, wearing the same gray necktie that he's tied her hands with during sex. Things get underway, and Christian makes a speech about trying to eradicate hunger around the world and that he had personally been a victim of going hungry, which shocks Ana and makes her wonder about his life before he was adopted. Diplomas are handed out, during which Christian and Ana share a brief exchange about her ignoring his emails, which puzzles her. Afterwards, Kate winds up introducing Christian to Ray as Ana's ""boyfriend,"" much to Ana's embarrassment, however, Christian goes along with it. He and Ray have a nice conversation about fishing. We meet Kate's brother, Ethan, who just came back from Europe. Ana is not happy with Kate, but she insists that she's doing Ana a favor and that Christian just needed a push. Privately, Ana tells Christian that she wants ""more"" than just the BDSM stuff if they engage in any kind of relationship, which puzzles him but yet, he doesn't dismiss it. She then verbally agrees to ""try"" to engage in the relationship he wants, and he is thrilled. Ray and Ana go out for lunch, parting ways with Christian.Later that night, Ray drops Ana off at home, and they say their goodbyes. She discovers her cell phone is dead, and upon charging it, she discovers 2 texts from Christian from the previous night, as well as an email on her laptop, both of which hoping she was okay driving home in her Beetle. They exchange more emails, and he decides to come over so they can discuss the contract again. She decides that she will give him the expensive books back and wraps them up before his arrival.Christian arrives, and they drink fancy wine out of teacups. She tells him that she feels cheap when he buys her expensive things, but he tells her it is his pleasure to do so and that she is most certainly not cheap. They discuss more specifics in the contract (use of sex toys and such). She admits that she is very uncomfortable with the idea of being punished, but he will not negotiate it saying ""it's all part of the deal."" Christian makes a deal with Ana that he will try to give her more beyond the BDSM, but he still isn't sure how it will work because he doesn't know any other way to have a relationship. In return, she has to accept his graduation present to her: a red hatchback, two-door compact Audi. They have sex, with Ana getting to have all the control by being on top, and go to sleep. Upon waking, Ana tries to touch Christian's chest but he tells her not to. She asks him again why he doesn't like to be touched, and he says, ""Because I'm fifty shades of fucked up."" He goes on to say that he had a very rough introduction to life and doesn't want to go into detail about it. While he is getting ready to leave, he urges Ana to seek out contraception because he hates wearing condoms. Ana is sad that he is leaving and rolls her eyes at one point, which is something Christian has warned her not to do, or he will spank her. He puts her over his lap and spanks her 18 times. It's not too painful, and Ana seems to semi-enjoy the experience. Christian then has sex with her from behind and soothes the redness on her butt from the spanking with baby oil.Taylor, Christian's live-in assistant, picks him up from Ana's apartment. She feels uncomfortable with herself that she actually enjoyed the spanking and isn't sure what kind of girl she is anymore. She calls her mom and they have an emotional conversation about men, and she urges Ana to come to Georgia to visit them and get away for a while. Kate comes home and sees Ana is upset about Christian again, urging her to dump him. After some wine, Kate leaves to call Elliot and Ana emails Christian. They exchange emails about Taylor selling her Beetle, and Ana refers to herself as a girl that Christian ""occasionally fucks."" This angers him, and she goes on to to say that she doesn't like him very much right now because he never stays with her. She abruptly shuts off the laptop and lies in bed, crying. Not even 10 minutes later, there is a commotion of Kate yelling at someone and Christian bursts into Ana's bedroom. Kate offers to throw him out, but Ana says it's fine. He wants to know why she is upset and feels it must be something he's done (men really are oblivious). Ana feels that he is trying to change her, but he doesn't see it that way and likes her the way she is. He just needs to feel that control over her by getting her to obey him and punishing her when she doesn't. Christian points out that she was sexually aroused after the spanking, so some part of her did enjoy it. He wants them to be honest with each other for their relationship to work. He lies down in bed with her, and they sleep.In the morning, Christian wakes up and realizes he's going to be late for a meeting. He leaves Ana with a promise to see her on Sunday. Ana gets ready for her last day working at Clayton's feeling good about her relationship with Christian. She exchanges a few emails with Christian about her confused feelings about being spanked. He tells her that she shouldn't feel ashamed and that she should free her mind and her body. Later at work, she gets another delivery from Christian: a blackberry so that he can contact her even more frequently now. He sends her an email saying he's leaving for Seattle and that he will see her on Sunday at Escala.Ana and Kate finally finish packing their apartment. Taylor comes to get Ana's Beetle so he can sell it, and Ana asks him how long he's been working for Christian (4 years). He also adds that Christian is ""a good man"" and Ana hopes this is the truth. Jose and Elliot show up later, and Ana and Jose decide to leave Kate and Elliot alone and get a drink at a bar. Later on, Ana discovers an email, several missed calls, and a stern voicemail from Christian (she promised to email after work, but she forgot). She calls him and they talk for a bit, ending with him wishing her luck with the move tomorrow. The next day, Elliot helps Kate and Ana move into their new place in Seattle. Christian has fancy champagne delivered to them as housewarming gift.Sunday arrives, and Ana heads to Escala. Upon arriving, Christian shows her a picture that was taken of them as a couple at the graduation in the Seattle Times (she is captioned as a ""friend""). Christian has scheduled for the best ob-gin in the city, Dr. Greene, to see Ana for a full examination and to prescribe her birth control pills. Before the doctor shows up, Christian invites Ana for dinner at his mother's house that evening, adding that he's never introduced a girl to his family before. Dr. Greene arrives and exams Ana, leaving her with a prescription. Christian and Ana eat lunch together and then he takes her to the playroom/Red Room of Pain. He goes into Dominant mode and starts giving her orders as to how she should act when they are in the playroom. Her hair must be braided, and she must wear nothing but her panties and sit on her knees by the door until he tells her otherwise. She does as she is told and he is pleased. They engage in some kinky sex with her being shackled from the ceiling, fondled with a riding crop, and then fucked up against a wooden cross on the wall. Despite her exhaustion, he has sex with her a second time, this time doggie-style with her hands tied together with a cable tie that he bought at Clayton's. With such excitement, Ana squirts all over Christian.After some sleep, they get ready to go to Christian's parents' house for dinner. Christian, however, pocketed Ana's panties during foreplay in the playroom and hasn't given them back. Ana decides to call his bluff and not ask for them back because he knows that's what he wants her to do, so she goes to the dinner without any panties on. Taylor drives them to the Greys' house, and they discuss Mrs. Robinson briefly (she taught Christian how to dance). They arrive, and the family greets them, including Kate, Elliot, and Mia who is back from Paris. Ana begins to feel that Christian only invited her along because Elliot invited Kate and he felt obligated. She also discloses to the family that she's planning on going to Georgia for a few days to see her mother, and Christian is obviously not thrilled about this. During dinner, they discuss various topics (Paris, Elliot's current construction job, etc) and Christian discreetly caresses Ana's thigh under the table, however, she abruptly shifts her legs away from him in response. He states he wants to show Ana the grounds and they leave the dining room together, with Christian practically dragging her across the backyard into the boathouse. She knows he's angry, but pleads with him not to spank her and instead gently touches his face and initiates a tender romantic kiss. He responds passionately but breaks away from her saying, ""What are you doing to me?"" He reveals that by her shifting her legs from him during dinner was her way of refusing him (no one has ever refused him before), and he found it very arousing. He's mad that she never told him about going to Georgia and he's going to have a quick, rough anal sex with her and not let her cum as punishment.After their tryst, Mia comes to find them so they can say goodbye to Elliot and Kate. Ana and Christian say their own farewells and head back to Escala. They discuss her trip to Georgia and Christian gives his blessing for her to go if it means so much to her. She says she needs time away from him and everything that has happened so she can get some clarity. Christian is worried that she is changing her mind about things, but tells her to take the time and sign the contract after Georgia. They arrive at Escala and get ready for bed. She wants him to make love to her and to be able to touch him, but he refuses. She insists on knowing more about his past so she can get to know him better, and he decides to tell her a few things after they engage in more kinky sex. He inserts 2 small metallic balls into her vagina and has her get him a glass of water (they stimulate as she walks). He spanks her a few times (for pleasure, not punishment), and they have sex. As they finally settle for sleep, Christian abruptly tells Ana that his birth mother was a crack whore who died when he was 4 years old.Ana wakes the next morning alone. She feels saddened by the new information Christian has told her and has a better understanding of why he lives an isolated life; however she still doesn't know why she can't touch him. She meets Mrs. Jones, Christian's housekeeper, in the kitchen. She finds Christian in his study, taking a business call. After his call, they have sex on his desk. He's disappointed that she still wants to go to Georgia. Later during breakfast, he offers Ana his private jet for her trip, but she refuses. They discuss her internship interview that she has scheduled that day, though she refuses to tell Christian which publishing company it's for so he won't interfere. She brings up the info he told her the previous night about his birth mother and he reveals he's never told anyone that before. He makes her promise to think about their arrangement while she is away, and they tell each other how much they'll miss each other.Ana goes to her interview at Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP). She meets Elizabeth Morgan, who is head of human resources. She is interviewed by Jack Hyde, the acquisitions editor. The interview goes well. At home, Ana and Kate discuss Christian. Kate says she thinks Christian is in love with Ana, and that Ana should confess her feelings to him, but she just isn't sure about all of it. Later, her and Christian exchange more flirty emails and she tells him that she will contact him when she is in Georgia. Kate and Ana go to the airport, and part ways to get on their flights. Ana discovers Christian has upgraded her ticket to first class. She enjoys the perks of first class despite being annoyed at Christian's stalker-ish tendencies. She sends him a few flirty emails before takeoff, and one of his responses talks about her being ""bound and gagged in a crate."" After landing in Georgia, Ana sends a long email to Christian about how much she is ""caught up in his spell"" but the ""crate"" comment scares her because she doesn't know if he's joking or not. She shares her complicated feelings towards him and how she needs some distance to sort them out.Ana has an emotional reunion with her mother and Bob. She texts Christian and her friends that she arrived in Georgia safely. She remembers Jose has an art gallery opening coming up and thinks about asking Christian to go with her. Later, at the beach, Ana and her mom discuss Christian and her mom gives her some good advice about men not being as complicated as women make them out to be, and that Ana should just take him literally and not over-think things. At the house, Ana unpacks and checks her email and sees Christian's reply. His response is very long, basically saying that Ana has totally disarmed him and he has never wanted to share his lifestyle more with anyone else than he does with her. He wants to make things work between them and will do whatever it takes to make her trust him and be comfortable. She realizes how much she misses him after reading it.Ana and Christian send emails to each other throughout much of the night. Christian leaves her hanging at one point, saying that he's having dinner with an old friend and he will be driving. She figures out that the ""old friend"" is probably Mrs. Robinson and isn't too happy. She sends Christian one last email asking him if it is Mrs. Robinson and doesn't get a response. The next day, Ana and her mother are at a bar drinking Cosmopolitans and talking more about men. Her mom gets the feeling that Ana isn't telling her everything that's bothering her about Christian. Ana finally gets a response from Christian on her Blackberry, confirming that it was Mrs. Robinson and that she is just an old friend. He also makes a remark about how many Cosmos she's drinking, and she figures out that he's there somewhere watching her. She sees him across the room, and he walks over to their table. Ana is very mad but contains herself and introduces him to her mom. They exchange some friendly banter and Carla invites him over to dinner for the next evening, and he accepts. She excuses herself to the bathroom so Ana and Christian can be alone, and they discuss Mrs. Robinson while she is gone. Ana sees her as a child molester, and Christian just doesn't see it that way and says that their sexual relationship is over, and she shouldn't be mad about him meeting up with her. He says that she was a ""force for good"" and that she ""helped"" him when he needed it the most. Ana inquires more about their past relationship and how it ended, to which Christian reveals that her husband eventually found out about them. Ana asks ""Did you love her?"" Just as Carla returns and the conversation ends. Christian excuses himself and tells Ana he will call her in the morning. Carla is convinced that Christian has strong feelings for Ana and urges her to go to him and see it through, considering he's flown across the country just to see her.Ana knocks on Christian's door and he opens it while taking a business call. She demands an answer to her last question, to which he says ""no."" She decides to stay and he is glad and notes that no one has ever been so mad at him like she has, except his family. They embrace and have wind up having sex in the bathroom, despite the fact that she has her period (it doesn't bother him). Afterwards, she notices a few burn scars on his chest that must have been from cigarettes. He assures her that Mrs. Robinson didn't make those, and defends her again saying that she kept him from going down the same path as his birth mother. He goes to her for advice about lots of things, including Ana herself. He's never had these in-depth discussions with anyone before Ana, except with his therapist, Dr. Flynn. He turns the tables and asks how she feels about their arrangement. She admits that she doesn't think she can be his submissive for entire weekends (as stated in the contract), and he agrees, saying jokingly that she's, ""not a great submissive."" They discuss spanking, and he tells her that she can always use a ""safe word"" to stop him if she can't take it. They talk some more and have sex in the bathtub. Ana admits to herself that she loves Christian. Later, they talk more about Christian's past sexual partners, to which there are many (he can't give her a specific number), and they were all submissive (however only 15 have been in the playroom). He reveals that he's paid for sex in the past, and there are BDSM places around for people to go if they want to learn and engage in the lifestyle. Ana is shocked by this and says that she can't shock him back. He reveals that she has shocked him several times (being a virgin, not wearing her underwear to his parents house, etc). He tells her that he has a surprise for her in the morning, and they go to sleep.They get up very early the next day, and he takes her to a mystery location. While in the car, the song ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears comes on through Christian's iPod. He says that one of his past submissive, Leila, put that song on there. Ana asks why things ended with Leila, and he says because she wanted more and he didn't. He has never wanted more, until he met Ana. He's had four long-term relationships apart from Elena (Mrs. Robinson's real name, the first time we've heard it). They all ended with Christian not wanting more, and they did, apart from one who found someone else. All of the others ""just didn't work out."" All of the new information boggles Ana's mind as they arrive at an airfield where Christian says they're going to ""chase the dawn"" by going gliding. After the trip, he gives her a romantic kiss and they head out to eat breakfast at an IHOP. He says Carrick used to take him to IHOP as a kid when his mom as away at medical conferences. They order food and Ana brings up the fact that Christian has ""changed his mind"" about the nature of their relationship. He thinks of it more as that they have to ""redefine our parameters."" She admits she was scared that he would leave her if she didn't agree to everything in the contract, and he says that he isn't going anywhere.Christian drops Ana off at her mother's house and they part ways. She tells Carla about her evening and offers to help her make a meal for Christian's visit that night. Ana emails Christian, thanking him for gliding trip, and they exchange more flirty emails. Later, Ana gets a call from Elizabeth Morgan at SIP, and they offer her an internship, and she accepts. She gets a call from Christian soon after, and he tells her that an emergency has come up in Seattle, and he has to fly back right away and will not make dinner. He says Taylor will pick her up from the airport tomorrow. Later, Ana thinks about Christian's change in attitude about wanting a more traditional relationship with her and realizes that Elena must have given him some advice about it, hence the change. She wonders if he landed safely and Seattle and emails him. They exchange more flirty banter. However, the ""situation"" in Seattle is not under control yet (Christian never reveals what it is).Ana flies home the next day. Taylor meets her at the airport in Seattle and drives her to Escala. She asks how Christian is, and he says he is ""preoccupied."" She arrives at Christian's apartment, and he immediately embraces her and takes her to the bathroom where he goes down on her, and they have sex. They take a shower together, and she tells him that she got a job, but she won't say where. She also invites him to go to Jose's photography show in Portland on Thursday, and he accepts. He washes her body, and she asks if she can do the same to him, to which he refuses and initiates sex with her again instead.Later, after eating a meal, Ana asks about the ""situation,"" and Christian says it's ""out of hand"" but nothing for her to worry about. Christian requests that Ana go to the playroom in fifteen minutes. He's had a whole wardrobe of clothes bought for her, as well. She goes to her room and assumes the required submissive playroom attire (panties only) and kneels by the playroom door. Christian enters and grabs something from a drawer. He instructs her that he is going to do something very intense to her, and she will not be able to see or hear him. He takes her to the bed, braids her hair, and shows her the flogger that he's going to use on her. He reminds her of the safe words she should use if she is in pain (""yellow"" to slow down, ""red"" to stop completely). She lies on the bed, blindfolds her, puts iPod ear buds in her ears, and ties her arms and legs (spread eagle style) to each of the four posts of the bed with leather cuffs. Beautiful music plays in her ears while Christian drags the flogger around her body to create different sensations. Eventually they have sex, and he releases her from her constraints and massages her shoulders afterwards. She asks him about what he heard her say in her sleep during their night together in Georgia, and he tells her that it was stuff about cages, strawberries, that she wanted more and that she missed him. She is relieved that it wasn't anything else, and he wonders if she is hiding something from him.Later, after sleeping, Ana wakes up and has to take her birth control pill (the time zone changes have screwed up her schedule). She finds Christian playing a sad song on his piano. She asks him when he started playing, and he says that when he was 6 years old, he threw himself into learning piano to please his new parents (Grace and Carrick). He wants to have sex on the piano, but she just wants to talk. They discuss the contract, and Christian says that the contract is pretty much obsolete at this point. She asks him to clarify what that means, and he states that he wants her to follow the rules all the time, but not the rest of the contract (unless they are in the playroom), and that he will still punish her if she breaks any of the rules. She wants to reread the rules, and he fetches her a copy of the contract to do so.After reading, Ana rolls her eyes, which has always been a rule-breaker for Christian. She realizes what she's done, and asks if he wants to spank her now, to which he obliges. However, she teases him by getting him to chase her around the kitchen. He playfully goes along with it and says that it's almost as if she doesn't want him to catch her, and she admits that's exactly what it is. She states, ""I feel about punishment the way you feel about me touching you"" and he is immediately saddened and horrified by this, showing just how much the notion of anyone touching him makes him fearful. Ana says she lets him spank her because he needs it, and he admits that he does need to hurt her, but nothing that she couldn't take. She wants to know why he needs to hurt her, and he says that if he tells her the reason, she will run screaming from the room and will never want to return. He doesn't want to risk losing her because he couldn't bear it and starts kissing her and begging her not to ever leave him. She senses in all of this, that Christian is lost in some private darkness and needs help. She decides to let him punish her. He is shocked and confused by this change of events, but she insists that he shows her ""how much it hurts."" She admits she is confused and not sure about going through with it, but at least they will both know if, once and for all, if she can handle the extent of his need for control.Christian leads Ana to the playroom and asks her to bend over a bench. She gets herself ready, mentally, telling herself that she can do this. Christian clarifies that he is going to hit her six times with a belt on the butt and that she will count each time. He tells her he is doing this because she rolled her eyes and tried to run away from her, and he doesn't want her to do that. He begins, and hits her once with the belt and it hurts a lot. With each hit from the belt, Ana is in a lot of pain and cannot control tears streaming down her face despite wanting to control herself. After the sixth and final blow, he immediately embraces her lovingly; however she pulls away and wants nothing to do with him. She calls him a ""fucked-up son of a bitch"" and leaves the playroom. Christian is completely shocked and does not understand.Ana cries in the other room, sad that she's in love with ""fifty shades"" and that this was all a wake-up call that there is no way she can be with him if she has to endure punishment like that. Christian joins her, bringing her cream and Advil for the soreness on her butt. He holds her and begs for her not to hate him, and she apologizes for the terrible thing she said. She also states that she can't be everything he wants her to be, and he disagrees, saying that she is everything he wants. She doesn't understand, saying that she isn't obedient, and she is ""sure as hell"" not going to let him hit her ever again like he just did. With a sudden bleak expression, he says, ""You're right. I should let you go. I'm not good for you."" She doesn't want to go and finally confesses that she has fallen in love with him. He is horrified by this, saying that she can't love him; that it is wrong and that he can't make her happy. She claims he does make her happy, but he says ""Not at the moment, not doing what I want to do."" With that, she resolves to leave him and asks for some privacy to shower and get dressed. Brokenhearted, Ana takes out a gift she got for Christian (a model kit for a glider) and leaves it for him with a note saying it reminds her of happier times.Ana and Christian are both fully dressed, and he is taking a call from Welch, his security advisor. He is clearly angry about something and asks Welch to ""find her"" (at this point, we don't know who ""her"" is). He hangs up and watches Ana unpack her MacBook, Blackberry, and Audi car keys and place them on the breakfast bar. She requests the money that Taylor got for selling her Beetle. He tries to convince her to keep all of those things, but she coldly refuses saying she wants nothing that will remind her of him. He writes her a check and offers to have Taylor take her home, and she reluctantly obliges. Before she leaves, he makes another plea for her to stay, but she refuses saying she ""just can't do this."" They part ways and Taylor drives her home. Once at her apartment, she curls up in her bed and cries."
The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2279373/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a diabolical pirate above the sea steals the secret Krabby Patty formula, SpongeBob and his nemesis Plankton must team up in order to get it back. During a fight between the Krusty Krab and Plankton, the secret formula disappears and all of Bikini Bottom goes into a terrible apocalypse. The Bikini Bottomites go crazy and they all believe that Spongebob and Plankton stole the secret formula. The two new teammates create a time machine to get the secret formula before it disappears and also go to some weird places along the way including a time paralex where they meet a time wizard named Bubbles who is a dolphin. The two later get to the time when the formula disappeared and take it back to the present day time. They then realized that it's a fake formula Plankton made when he was taking the real one and the Bikini Bottomites try to destroy Spongebob (Plankton runs away) Spongebob smells Krabby patties and so does everyone else so the Bikini Bottomites follow it (instead of destroying Spongebob) and they arrive at the bank of the surface. Everyone except Spongebob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Sandy, and a stowaway Plankton go back home while the six characters that stayed are greeted by Bubbles who takes them to the surface where a pirate is selling Krabby Patties. The team learns that they can write in a magic book and it'll make whatever they write in it become true. They decide to turn themselves into superheroes and battle the pirate. Meanwhile, Plankton writes himself as a superhero too.—jtgus1120 Plankton sets up one final trick to try and steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula. In his attempt the formula dissapears and Bikini Bottom falls into chaos. The only way to save it is for our heros to leave their watery environment and travel across land to get the formula back.—n-c-arroyo10 After the Krabby Patty secret formula miraculously disappears, SpongeBob must teach Plankton the power of teamwork. While this is happening an evil pirate is making and serving Krabby Patties to people above the surface. SpongeBob and Plankton must work together to defeat the pirate; with help from Mr Krabs, Sandy, Patrick, Squidward, and a magical dolphin named bubbles. A pirate named Burger Beard travels to Bikini Atoll, where he obtains a magical book with the power to make any text written upon it real. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants and his adventures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant, where he cooks hamburgers called Krabby Patties and works for Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab CEO. He has spent several years prudently protecting the secret Krabby Patty formula from Plankton, the owner of a competing restaurant called the Chum Bucket. One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a military battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender and uses a decoy of himself to give Mr. Krabs a fake penny, which the real Plankton then hides inside in order to gain access to Krabs' vault. As the decoy distracts Mr. Krabs, Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and the two engage in a tug of war over the formula, which magically disappears before anyone can claim it.. Out on an island somewhere in Bikini Atoll, a pirate named Burger Beard steals an ancient, magical book that tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants. He tells a small flock of seagulls the story, without interruption from them trying to sing the theme song.
Down in Bikini Bottom, Plankton makes yet another of his efforts to steal the Krabby Patty formula, by flying in on a World War II-style airplane. SpongeBob and Patrick protect the fort and launch a counterattack. However, Plankton eventually manages to breach the Krusty Krab's defenses in a giant robot. The robot malfunctions, Plankton doesn't have enough money for a bribe and, giving Mr. Krabs a penny, leaves in tears. Mr. Krabs goes out of the Krusty Krab to gloat while SpongeBob observes. Meanwhile, the real Plankton, who had been hiding in the penny, sneaks into Mr. Krabs' office and opens the safe to steal the formula, replacing it with a different piece of paper in a bottle. Unbeknownst to him, SpongeBob has decided to go back into Mr. Krabs' office to check on the formula and catches Plankton trying to steal it. Meanwhile Mr. Krabs discovers that the crying figure he thought was Plankton was actually a robot decoy and finds too late that the Krusty Krab has gone into lockdown. A struggle ensues between SpongeBob and Plankton for possession of the formula. Just then, the secret formula magically vanishes (thanks to Burger-Beard using the book to teleport it into his possession). SpongeBob and Plankton stand stock still, unable to believe what just happened. Mr. Krabs forces his way into the Krusty Krab and questions Plankton for the whereabouts of the formula. Plankton says he doesn't have it. Mr. Krabs doesn't believe him, and SpongeBob tells his boss that normally he wouldn't believe Plankton either but this time he's telling the truth. Mr. Krabs ignores SpongeBob's protests and tortures Plankton by taping him to his desk and making SpongeBob laugh so that Plankton would talk. The torture session is interrupted by Squidward, who comes in to tell Mr. Krabs that the customers are getting restless and asking for refunds. While Mr. Krabs is distracted, Plankton secretly escapes. Krabs sends SpongeBob to make more patties, but there are no more in the vault. Sandy bought the last ones. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob that he must have the formula memorized by now, but SpongeBob says that the formula may not be recorded in memory. Mr. Krabs rallies the town to pursue Plankton and corner him. He prepares to stomp on Plankton, but SpongeBob protects Plankton by putting him in a bubble. He steps inside the bubble and they float away.
Mr. Krabs laments SpongeBob being gone and proclaims that Bikini Bottom will plunge into chaos. True to his word, Bikini Bottom becomes a barren, apocalyptic wasteland.
Burger-Beard closes the book and decides it's the end of the story, and writes ""The End"" to prove his point. The seagulls are angry that he left the story on a cliffhanger, tear out the page Burger-Beard wrote ""The End"" on and dump it into the ocean.
Back in Bikini Bottom Patrick goes to the Krusty Krab and asks Squidward for a patty, but finds that they're all out. SpongeBob convinces Plankton that they should team up to find the secret formula and save the world. While Sandy is eating her Krabby Patties, to the distress of a very hungry Patrick, she watches the television and sees that Bikini Bottom is in chaos. As she is wondering what's going on, the page with ""The End"" written on it lands on her tree dome.
SpongeBob and Plankton go around Bikini Bottom looking for team members. They try Patrick first, but he quickly betrays them. Then they try to get Sandy on their team, but she's already gone mad from trying to figure out what the page with ""The End"" on it means. They go back to SpongeBob's house to get Gary on their team, but Gary is now the leader of a snail cult.
Alone together and on the run from an angry mob, SpongeBob and Plankton hide out on a cliff. Plankton gets SpongeBob to go to sleep, and the sponge does. Plankton jumps into one of SpongeBob's pores and goes into his brain to look for the secret formula. Instead he finds SpongeBob's dream: A saccharine world of living candy. Plankton runs screaming out of the dream, waking SpongeBob up in the process. Because Plankton is covered in cotton candy, SpongeBob catches on that Plankton has betrayed him. He sings a song about teamwork and then gives Plankton the idea that they should build a time machine to go back to the past and bring the formula to the present. They break into the Chum Bucket to break Karen out and use her to power the time machine. They go into a little restaurant called Taco Häus and build it. However, they make a mistake. They accidentally go one week into the future first and find that Bikini Bottom has become a desert, and Patrick is the only one for miles around. Then they accidentally go to a space station where a mystical dolphin named Bubbles has been watching the planets for ten thousand years. He gets SpongeBob and Plankton to watch the planets while Bubbles takes a bathroom break, but Saturn and Jupiter crash into each other. Bubbles gets angry and chases the two back into the time machine. Finally they go back to the moment when Plankton was stealing the formula, and SpongeBob manages to wrestle the bottle from Plankton's past self. On the surface, Burger-Beard sets up his own Krabby Patty stand on a coastal California town. Sandy comes into the Krusty Krab and announces that the research she's done leads her to conclude that the sandwich gods are angry with them (the 'The End' page had a picture of a burger on it). SpongeBob and Plankton arrive back at the present and find that they don't have the formula after all, but the decoy bottle that Plankton put in the place of the formula (which was a taunting note towards Mr. Krabs). SpongeBob and Plankton fall out and SpongeBob freaks out. He quickly collects himself and offers himself as a sacrifice to please the town. Instead of giving up their savage behavior for SpongeBob's sake, the town seizes him and tries to execute him by dropping a massive weight on him. While he's being executed, SpongeBob smells Krabby Patties, but nobody believes him. However, Mr. Krabs smells them too and saves SpongeBob at the last minute. The town tears off their apocalyptic clothes and follows the smell. To their dismay, it leads to the surface. Everyone except the main characters leaves. Squidward tries to go with them but Mr. Krabs insists he stay. Suddenly, Bubbles emerges, and announces he's been fired from his job as cosmic seer, but is happy about it because his job was boring."
Straight Outta Compton,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1398426/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The rap groupNWAemerges from the mean streets of Compton in Los Angeles, California, in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes Hip Hop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood. In 1987, five young men, using brutally honest rhymes and hardcore beats, put their frustration and anger about life in the most dangerous place in America into the most powerful weapon they had: their music. Taking us back to where it all began, Straight Outta Compton tells the true story of how these cultural rebels-armed only with their lyrics, swagger, bravado and raw talent-stood up to the authorities that meant to keep them down and formed the world's most dangerous group, N.W.A. And as they spoke the truth that no one had before and exposed life in the hood, their voice ignited a social revolution that is still reverberating today.—Universal Pictures In 1980s, a group of five men built a revolutionary hiphop music group named N.W.A in the hard circumstances of one of the most dangerous suburban in the US. Their debute album with controversial tracks that represent the minorities insecurity, Straight Outta Compton became popular.

In San Andreas, California is experiencing a statewide earthquake that goes on record as easily the biggest earthquake in history. Dwayne Johnson plays Ray Gaines, a helicopter rescue pilot for the Los Angeles Fire Department, who is trying to find his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), who is in San Francisco amid-st the chaos. Ray's estranged wife, Emma, is forced to turn to Ray for help, as he is her last resort. Together they journey to save their daughter.—ahmetkozan In Los Angeles, the Fire Department Air Rescue pilot Raymond ""Ray"" Gaines will drive his daughter Blake to San Francisco since she has joined the university. He is divorcing from his wife Emma that intends to move in together with her wealthy boyfriend Daniel Riddick. Meanwhile the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes and Dr. Kim Park from the Caltech travel to a dam to check their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam. Lawrence discovers that the San Andreas Fault is moving and will cause a huge earthquake in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Ray needs to travel to help the victims from the dam and Daniel offers to take Blake to San Francisco since he has a meeting in the city. Daniel brings Blake to his office and while waiting for him, she befriends the British architect Ben Taylor and his younger brother Ollie Taylor. When Ray is flying to the dam, there is an earthquake in Los Angeles and then the earthquake reaches San Francisco. What will happen next?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Chief Raymond Gaines, a former Afghanistan helicopter pilot and now a search-and-rescue pilot for the Los Angeles Fire Department, has to cope with a divorce and a painful family tragedy. When a sudden massive earthquake demolishes Hoover Dam, triggering a devastating string of quakes from L.A. to San Francisco by the entire length of the San Andreas fault, Ray will embark on a frenzied mission to rescue not only his estranged wife, Emma but also his trapped eighteen-year-old daughter, Blake. Inevitably, as scientists warn for yet another catastrophic seism, Ray needs to succeed in the most important rescue of his life, however, is there enough time?—Nick Riganas Helicopter pilot Raymond Gaines leads a military veterans rescue team in the LAFD, including Joby O'Leary. Gaines grudgingly misses out on a weekend with his daughter Blake, who announces being engaged to leading architect Daniel Riddick and moving in with him at San Francisco. After Caltech seismologist Dr. Lawrence Hayes's team spots worrying quake-predicting data, his colleague Dr. Kim Park follows up at the Hoover Dam, where he dies as at breaks down. As Hayes warns on TV, the persisting parameters indicate the whole San Andreas Fault is going to quake as badly, wrecking metropolises LA and San Francisco. Picking up his ex Emma, Gaines abandons his duty to search for Blake, even after her cellphone breaking down suggests her probably already being buried. Luckily for her, she was saved from the subterranean car parking of duly fleeing Riddicks's HQ by applying British architect Ben Taylor, who has a crush on her, encouraged as in all by his dashing kid brother Ollie, so the trio heads for higher ground despite the dim chances of rescue and the likelihood of further collapses, unaware there rescue is on its way.—KGF Vissers The film opens with a girl, Natalie (Morgan Griffin), driving along the cliffs of San Fernando Valley, 16 miles (25.75 km) north of Los Angeles, when suddenly a rock slide pushes the car, causing it to fall and then hang at the edge of a cliff. Moments later, Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-pilot Chief Raymond ""Ray"" Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) and his other colleagues comes to rescue the girl trapped in the car. Ray safely rescues the girl moments before the car falls off the cliff.In CALTECH, Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) receives data of minor earthquakes in Falco, Nevada and shows it to his colleague and seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti). The minor quakes measure 2.0 to 2.6. Hayes is curious about why such minor quakes can happen even where there are no faults in Nevada. Hayes and Park decide to go to Nevada to find out.While Ray is calling his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), for an upcoming trip to San Francisco, he receives divorce papers. Recently, he was divorced from his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and she is now with her new boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd).Meanwhile, at the Hoover Dam, Park along with Hayes is now testing a magnetic pulse of quake. Suddenly, his device detects a spike pulse and then a stronger earthquake triggers. It measures 7.0 - highest ever recorded there. As the dam starts to break, Park struggles to escape while Hayes tells the people still on the dam to get off. Park now exits the dam facility, however when he sees a girl afraid to move on the breaking dam, he stops to grab her and carry her out. The girl is rescued but Park is impaled by a rod in his right foot. The dam completely crumbles and Park is killed. The disaster leads to the flooding of towns. The earthquake is the strongest and most destructive ever recorded in Nevada's history.Back in California, Ray arrives at his family's house to plan for their trip. But Ray is called back to work to rescue disaster victims in Nevada. Daniel and Blake drive in to San Francisco for a meeting. While Daniel is having a meeting, Blake meets an English guy named Ben Taylor (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) - having an interview - and his brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson).In CALTECH, the reporter, Serena (Archie Panjabi) arrives and wants to interview Hayes about what happen in Nevada. Hayes states that they didn't know there was any fault line there. He says that they should be able to predict an earthquake. One of his colleague interrupts Hayes and presents him with data showing the pulse rates detected along the entire San Andreas fault. The pulse rates are higher than Nevada. Hayes then explains to them why the earthquake triggered in Nevada even with no fault line: his theory is to draw a fault line near Nevada and it connects to the end of the fault boundary. Hayes predicts that the whole San Andreas might trigger.In Los Angeles, Emma is having a lunch with Daniel's sister, Susan, in a high rise restaurant. After some conversation with Susan, Emma answers a call from Ray, in the helicopter en route for maintenance. Ray apologizes to Emma for what he did the other day. Their phone conversation is interrupted by the strong earthquake. Emma tells Ray that they're having an earthquake and he also notices that the freeway is crumbling. Ray instructs Emma to get to the roof for rescue. According to the CALTECH, the first major earthquake peaked at 8.5 and later 9.1. Not only in Los Angeles, but the whole of California and the quake is heading to San Francisco where Blake and Daniel are.While the ensuing destructive earthquake hits, the people inside the building panic in terror; some are injured. Emma tells Susan to get to the roof, but she goes to the exit and is killed in a crumbling floor. Emma makes it to the roof, with the floor and the surrounding structures crumbling around her. Emma manages to recover and emerges from the rubble. Finally, Ray rescues Emma and they barely escape as the surrounding structures collapse. The whole city is now completely devastated.Meanwhile in San Francisco, after Ben's interview, Blake borrows Ollie's book to write her number in it for Ben to call her. Blake and Daniel are leaving the building parking lot when the earthquake hits. They manages to escape but the ceiling collapses and they become trapped. The debris crushes part of the car, trapping Blake's leg under the driver's seat. Daniel goes to get help. As Daniel calls for help, the debris falls near him and kills a security guard. Daneil flees in terror instead of saving Blake.However, Ben and Ollie are struggling to save Blake as the debris above her continues to press the roof. By using the jack to lift the debris, the driver's seat pushes away but Blake's leg is still stuck. Finally Ben pops the car tires lowering the car and they rescue her. The trio get out of the building as the aftershock continues. The trio decides to go to the electronic store to contact Ray.At the store, Blake finds a phone and she calls her parents telling them that she's okay. Also, she tells them that Daniel left her. This makes Emma angry and she leaves a nasty message on Daniel's voicemail. Ray advises Blake that they will need to get out immediately and to go to the Coit Tower as a rendezvous. Ray and Emma quickly head to San Francisco to save their daughter.Meanwhile, Daniel is walking through the crowd in the street when suddenly another strong earthquake hits. The structure over the crowd collapses. In order to save himself, Daniel steals the safe spot of one of someone else and the victim is swept away by the debris.When Ray and Emma are en route to the city, the helicopter's engine fails, forcing them to make a crash landing into a superstore in Bakersfield. As they try to steal a vehicle, which is already stolen, the thief aims a gun at Ray but Ray manages to subdue the perpetrator and they drive away.With the help of Serena, Hayes is able to warn the people through news coverage of a much bigger earthquake about to hit San Francisco. He tells the people of San Francisco to get out now because their lives depends on it.After Ray and Emma obtain the vehicle, they drive till they meet an elderly couple who warns them to stop - it is the now-opened San Andreas fault rendering the road impassable. They drive back to the old couple's home. The couple happens to own an airplane which Ray exchanges for the stolen car. Ray and Emma manage to fly the plane to San Francisco. While on the plane, Ray recaps what happen with their daughter, Mallory, who died in a rafting accident. Ray regrets he could not save his daughter. This the underlying reason Emma wants a divorce. Then they fly to San Francisco.Blake, Ben and Ollie, walk through the crowded streets to Coit Tower - the agreed on meeting place. However, it is already engulfed in flames so they change the plan by going to the highest ground which is Nob Hill in order to signal Blake's family.Ray and Emma make it to San Francisco but they cannot land the plane because the airport has a lot of cracks and scattered planes. Ray and Emma have no choice but to sky dive into the stadium leaving the plane to crash into the Pacific Ocean when it runs out of fuel.Meanwhile, Blake, Ben and Ollie are walking through the deserted street when the strong earthquake hits. The earthquake measures 9.6, the largest recorded in history. Blake and Ollie quickly get to the side of the street ... but Ben goes to the opposite side. The glass shards, coming from the building, cuts Ben's leg. The remaining still-standing structures are destroyed, the ground ruptures, suspension bridges crumble, etc. At the same time, Ray manages to tell other people people to move to safety on the other side of the stadium as the structure crashes down.After the earthquake, Blake carefully removes the glass shard from Ben's leg and then they move to the highest ground. Ray and Emma drive a boat to the city where they see Coit Tower is on fire. Ray knows that Blake has gone somewhere else. They notice that the water is receding quickly, which means a tsunami is about to hit the city. As the trio receives the tsunami warning from the radio, it is too late for them to head to the highest ground. So, the trio quickly heads to Daniel's unfinished building.Ray and Emma, in the boat (and many other boats), manage to drive into the giant tidal wave. They make it to the top just before the wave crests though they are almost hit by a cargo ship that is carried along by the tidal wave. Daniel, happens to be on the Golden Gate Bridge when the wave strikes. He is crushed by a falling shipping container from the overturned cargo ship. The cargo ship slices the Golden Gate Bridge in half and the tidal wave continues to race towards the city. Sadly, most of the people on the ground are swept away by water and debris.The trio is in now in the building when the tidal wave hits. Ray and Emma drive the boat through the devastated town looking for Blake. Blake and Ollie sees her parents riding in the boat but they don't see Blake. Ollie then uses the laser pointer that he obtained from the electronics store to attract Blake's parents' attention. Now the parents see them, but before they can save them, the building starts to sink into the ground. Blake is separated from the two brothers as they make it up to the next floor. Blake is now trapped inside as the water continues to rise. Ray manages to get to his daughter, but now the exits are jammed. Blake then seems to have drowned and Ray struggles to get her body out. As the building is going to collapse, Emma crashes through the window in the boat and they quickly get out as the building finally collapses.Once outside, Ray continues to try and then successfully revives Blake - reunited with her family. The two boys are also rescued. Later, the five make it to safety in Marin County. The family along with Ben and Ollie watch the sunset on the destroyed and radically altered geography of the San Francisco Bay Area and they talk about the future. They also see an American flag is waving over the now-destroyed Golden Gate Bridge."
Mad Max: Fury Road,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a woman rebels against a tyrannical ruler in search for her homeland with the aid of a group of female prisoners, a psychotic worshiper and a drifter named Max. An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.—Production In the stark desert wasteland populated by a broken humanity driven with survival and the unending ravage for gasoline, a loner named Max finds himself unwantedly caught in the middle of a chase while aiding the heroine Furiosa and her female companions. She struggles to return to her homeland and escape the clutches of a ruthless desert gang leader, Immortal Joe. With the harsh desert sands in front of them and marauders behind, only the maddest will prevail the storm. Years after the collapse of civilization, the tyrannical Immortan Joe enslaves apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress the Citadel. When the warrior Imperator Furiosa leads the despot's five wives in a daring escape, she forges an alliance with Max Rockatansky, a loner and former captive. Fortified in the massive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord and his henchmen in a deadly high-speed chase through the Wasteland.—Jwelch5742 Trapped in the barren deserts of the dystopian Wasteland, lone road warrior Max Rockatansky struggles to stay one step ahead of the water-controlling overlord Immortan Joe and the Wild Boys, his loyal gang of marauders. But life in the carcass of civilisation is cheap. And to further complicate matters, Max then crosses paths with fearless Imperator Furiosa: one of Joe's elite lieutenants and a traitor--she has just fled the Citadel in her heavily armoured truck, The War Rig, absconding with an irreplaceable quintet of wives. Now, there is no turning back. As the powerful tyrant and his unstoppable horde of delusional zealots hunt them down with murderous intent, Max and Furiosa will need all the help they can get to stay alive. However, do they have what it takes to cheat death and live to tell the tale?—Nick Riganas Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) explains in a voice-over that he was once a cop and road warrior and is now trekking through post-apocalyptic Australia, running from haunting thoughts of his dead wife and child and other people he's failed to save. As he stands on a ridge looking around, a two-headed lizard crawls near Max and he stomps on it before eating it. He drives off and is quickly pursued by a group of scavengers called the War Boys, all pale and covered in blisters due to radiation sickness. They chase Max through the desert and force him to crash before they capture him.The War Boys take Max to their lair in the Citadel, a system of caves in a very tall mesa. They shave his head and face. They tattoo his back with a notice saying he is a universal blood donor (type O negative), intending to use him as a blood supply. They cover the lower part of his face with a trident-shaped iron muzzle and nearly brand him with an image of a skull engulfed in fire but he breaks free and runs from the War Boys. The chase through the caves shows that the Citadel is extensive and has an ample water supply as well as greenhouses. As he runs, Max continues to see images of the dead before he makes it to an exit high above the ground. He jumps out and latches onto a swinging hook, but he keeps swinging back toward the War Boys and they manage to pull him back into the tunnel.In the Citadel, there is a large community of survivors lorded over by the leader of the War Boys, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played the villain Toecutter in the originalMad Max (1979)film). Joe wears a grotesque face mask made of horse teeth set in a large pair of jaws, with air hoses attached to a bellows system on his back to help him breathe (presumably, his lungs are damaged). As he addresses a crowd on the ground below the Citadel, he supplies the people with some water, making everyone go crazy and fight for it once Joe shuts it off after a few seconds. He warns the people not to become addicted to water so that they do not go mad over its absence. Joe then sends his commander Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) out in a huge war rig to collect fuel from Gas Town, with an escort of War Boys in smaller vehicles. Furiosa has a metal prosthesis in place of her lower left arm and hand.On the road, Furiosa diverts from the path to Gas Town (glimpsed as a distant group of oil refineries) and heads east. Joe is alerted to the change and runs to the locked chambers where he keeps his five wives (young women chosen to breed his children). They're all gone, and writing on the walls says ""Our children will not be warlords"" and ""Who killed the world?"" An old woman tells Joe that he cannot own a human. Furiosa is taking the women away from Joe, prompting him to rally the War Boys and go after her. All the War Boys are eager to join the chase, but one called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is so weak that he needs a ""blood bank"" -- which means Max goes along for the ride, chained to Nux and connected to the driver via a central line transfusion tube. The War Boys believe that Immortan Joe can deliver them to the gates of Valhalla, so Nux is willing to risk death in service to his leader.The War Boys ride after Furiosa's war rig, which is attacked by another scavenging tribe, the Buzzards. Nux straps Max to the hood of his car like the figurehead on a ship and eagerly chases Furiosa alongside the others. They attempt to get close to the rig, but Furiosa shakes most of them off, the War Boys aiding in the battle with explosive-tipped spears. Nux gets close to the rig as Max attempts to break free. Furiosa drives toward a enormous oncoming sand storm. Nux continues to chase her, even as they head into treacherous sand tornadoes. A few War Boys are killed in the storm, while Nux plots a kamikaze run by spilling his fuel inside his car. He plans to set it ablaze with a flare when Max is able to overpower and stop him. The two crash in the storm.Max awakens to find himself still chained to an unconscious Nux and still wearing his muzzle. He grabs a shotgun and tries to shoot off Nux's wrist, but the gun misfires. He spots Furiosa's rig and walks there, finding five beautiful women -- the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast the Knowing (Zoë Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), and the Dag (Abbey Lee) -- cleaning themselves with a hose and removing their chastity belts with bolt cutters. Splendid is nine months pregnant with Joe's child, and Dag is also carrying his baby. Max points the shotgun at the women and demands the hose. He drinks, then tells them to use the cutters to cut off his chain. Dag tries to but cannot break it. Furiosa sees in the distance that Joe has gathered reinforcements from the other towns that supply gas and ammunition to the Citadel. The approaching forces are led by the People Eater (John Howard) and the Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter). Max and Furiosa fight as he tries to cut the chain that ties him to Nux. Nux wakes up and helps Max fight Furiosa, who is assisted by the other women. Nux cuts the chain and Max tries to take the rig for himself. However, it stalls because Furiosa installed a kill switch and only she knows how to start it again. Max lets her back on the rig but he doesn't want to take the rest of the women. Furiosa insists that they come along, as she is guiding them to a location she calls the Green Place. When Furiosa explains that Joe's ""gratitude"" toward Max will probably be a slow, painful death, Max gives in and as they ride off in the war rig, Nux sneaks on board. He disconnects the brake line to the fuel pod, slowing the rig down. Max crawls out on the tanker and reconnects the line. During this leg of the chase, Max is able to remove his face mask with a file given to him by Furiosa.Furiosa drives the rig into a canyon where she has an arrangement with a group of biker bandits: they'll close the pass behind her with a rock slide to foil her pursuers in exchange for the 3000 gallons of fuel in the trailer pod. She teaches Max the sequence of switches to throw to defeat the kill switch, then asks his name. He doesn't want to tell her, so she says ""When I yell 'Fool', drive out of here fast."" They spot Joe and his forces closing in. Furiosa gets out and shouts to the bikers that she's brought the 3000 gallons of fuel, as agreed, and she'll detach the pod. One of the bikers complains that she said there would be a few pursuers, but there are three large parties. Furiosa, dodging to put the rig between herself and the bikers, yells ""Fool!"" and manages, between bullets, to climb back on as Max drives the rig away. Though she never did detach the fuel trailer, the the bikers blow up the overpass, temporarily halting Joe's pursuit. As they race away, Furiosa and Max fight off the biker bandits with their respective talents for marksmanship.Immortan Joe, in his large-wheeled, off-road vehicle, is able to climb over the rockfall. He's joined by Nux, who proves that Splendid is on Furiosa's rig with a scrap of cloth he'd taken from her. Another chase ensues through the desert. The War Boys keep trying to overtake the rig while Joe catches up. He attempts to shoot at the rig until Splendid steps out as a human shield, and Joe cannot do a thing without hurting his potential son. Nux attempts to help Joe, who sprays chrome paint on Nux's mouth with the promise of bringing him to the gates of Valhalla if Nux succeeds. Almost immediately, Nux loses his gun in front of Joe, who continues driving with disappointment. Splendid tries climbing back to the front of the rig, but she falls off and is run over by Joe's car. The women tell Max to turn back, but when he tells Furiosa that Splendid went under the wheels, Furiosa says they must keep going. The others cry for Splendid. Behind them, Joe screams in rage while holding Splendid's body.Nux slips back into the rig with the promise of helping the women evade Joe. He lies on the floor, distraught that he has failed Joe yet again and has lost his chance of joining his personal army. Capable consoles him. At the front, Furiosa tells Max of the Green Place and how she was taken from it as a child.As they continue driving through the night, the rig becomes stuck in a large field of mud. The Bullet Farmer is not far behind them. Max shoots at him but misses, and then Furiosa gets a clean shot, taking out the Bullet Farmer's lights and blinding him. Nux suggests they attach the truck's winch cable to a nearby tree and pull the rig forward.Meanwhile, Joe's lieutenant the Organic Mechanic (Angus Sampson) takes Splendid's body, as she is near death, and he cuts the baby out of her abdomen. The baby is dead too, but he tells Joe that it was a boy. Joe tells his adult son Rictus (Nathan Jones) that he had a brother. Rictus screams proudly. The women continue trying to push the rig out of the mud while Max goes out to face the Bullet Farmer himself. A few bright flashes of explosions are seen in the distant fog and he returns shortly with the Bullet Farmer's blood on his face, along with a nice supply of guns and ammo.In the morning, the rig comes up to a tower where a naked woman, the Valkyrie (Megan Gale), is screaming for help. Max thinks it's a trap, but Furiosa steps out and tells the Valkyrie her mother's name and her affiliation with this clan. The Valkyrie climbs down the tower and puts on a robe. More older women, the Vuvalini, emerge. The eldest, Keeper of the Seeds (Melissa Jaffer), recognizes Furiosa. Furiosa tells them that she is taking the women from the Citadel to the Green Place, but Keeper of the Seeds informs her that the muddy swamp they passed through was the Green Place, and has long since become uninhabitable. Furiosa walks into the sand and falls on her knees, screaming in despair. The Vuvalini agree to help the women from the Citadel ride across the salt flats (the dried up ocean) in search of a home. Max, still haunted by the images of his wife and child, decides to help the women go back to the Citadel since Joe's greenery and water supply are currently unguarded. They also plan to trap Joe and his army in the canyons.The group rides back in the direction of the Citadel. Joe sees them with his telescope, knowing full-well what their plan is. He gathers his army and gives chase. The Vuvalini help fight back. The Valkyrie shoots at the War Boys while defending one of her own until she is run over. Max and Furiosa kill some of the War Boys, while Max gets Joe to kill the People Eater by using him as a human shield. Keeper of the Seeds is also killed when one of the War Boys cuts her neck. Toast is captured by Joe and held hostage. Furiosa is stabbed on Joe's vehicle and grows weaker as Joe and Rictus gain momentum. Toast distracts Joe long enough to give Furiosa an opportunity to hook Joe's mask onto the wheels of his car. She growls, ""Remember me?"" to him as the wheels rip the mask and part of Joe's face off, killing him. The rig then heads toward the canyon, with Rictus still trying to stop them. The women get off safely while Nux says goodbye to Capable and swerves against the canyon, sacrificing himself to kill Rictus and collapse the overpass to put an end to Joe's army.On the way back to the Citadel, Furiosa's lungs nearly collapse. Max punches a small hole in her side to give her air. She starts to lose consciousness, and Max gives her a transfusion of his own blood. He finally tells her his name as she closes her eyes.The group arrives at the Citadel. Max presents the people with Joe's mouthless corpse, making everyone cheer. They rip Joe's corpse apart and feed off him. The water supply is brought out, giving the people as much water as they need. Furiosa rises and apparently becomes the new leader. She and Max acknowledge each other with respect once more before he slips away into the crowd to continue down his own path."
Daddy's Home,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528854/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Brad Whitaker is a radio host trying to get his stepchildren to love him and call him Dad. But his plans turn upside down when their biological father, Dusty Mayron, returns. Stepfather Brad Whitaker is hoping for his stepchildren to love him and treat him like a dad. All is going well until the biological father, Dusty Mayron, shows up, then everything takes a toll. His stepchildren start putting him second and their father first, and now Dusty will have to learn that being a good dad is about pains and struggles. Brad will also experience once again what it's like to be a stepdad. Aspiring to be the perfect husband to his beautiful new wife, Sarah, and the best super-dad to her two young kids, Megan and Dylan, the smooth-jazz radio-station manager with a heart of gold, Brad, is, indeed, a beloved stepfather. However, just as things started to work out for the family, Brad's polar opposite and Sarah's cool ex-husband with the perfect six-pack, Dusty, decides to pay a visit for a quick catch-up with the children. Suddenly, this new alpha-dad gets all the attention in the house with his impressive skills, dragging Brad in a fierce no-holds-barred competition for the ""King of the Castle"" title. Who will prevail in this mano-a-mano paternal face-off?—Nick Riganas Mild-mannered radio executive Brad Whitaker struggles to be a good stepfather to his wife Sara's two children, Megan and Dylan, and is seemingly sterile after an accident to his testicles some years ago. The children begin to grow closer to Brad, with Dylan confiding in him that he is being picked on at school and Megan asking him to take her to a father/daughter dance at her school. One night, the kids' biological father, Sara's ex-husband Dusty Mayron, calls and discovers Sara's marriage with Brad. He suddenly announces he will be visiting the next day. Sara hesitates to let her ex-husband into their home, but Brad convinces her that it is important for the kids that their father and stepfather establish a respectful relationship.. Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) is married to Sara (Linda Cardellini) and is stepdad to her two kids Dylan (Owen Vaccaro) and Megan (Scarlett Estevez). Brad is unfortunately unable to produce children of his own due to an incident at the dentist where his groin was exposed to X-ray radiation. Despite his best intentions and hardest attempts, the kids don't really take kindly to Brad. Still, his biggest hope is for them to see him as an acceptable father figure.Over time, the kids warm up to Brad. Dylan even confides to Brad that he is being picked on at school by some 4th graders. Brad gets excited since he feels he's built trust between him and Dylan (even though he goes ahead and tells Sara). Megan invites Brad to the daddy-daughter dance, which makes Brad so happy that he cries.The family is watching ""The Princess Bride"" when the phone rings. Dylan answers and becomes ecstatic to hear his biological dad Dusty's (Mark Wahlberg) voice. Megan runs and grabs the phone too. They pass the phone to Brad, who agrees to pick up Dusty from the airport the next day. Sara gets worried since Dusty is just showing up out of the blue, but Brad is confident that he can handle him.Brad goes to pick up Dusty at the airport and is stunned to see a much more handsome and cooler-looking guy descending the escalator. Brad approaches the man and asks if he is Dusty, but he says no. When Brad gets home, he sees a motorcycle parked outside. Dusty is already in there playing with the kids. He formally meets Brad and comes off as friendly. Later, when Dusty tucks the kids into bed, he is obviously trying to look better than Brad by giving the kids $20. The men go outside and share a beer, and they drop the nice acts to say what they're really thinking. Brad asks Dusty why he's there, and he says he wants to be a good father figure now that Sara has remarried, but he promises to let the kids accept Brad as their new dad.Dusty starts the pissing contest by getting the kids a mangy dog that he calls Tumor (""because he grows on you""). The dog doesn't like Brad. Brad takes Dusty to his job at a radio station where Dusty meets Brad's boss Mr. Holt (Thomas Haden Church). The two quickly hit it off, and Dusty even scores a gig as the voice of their radio station mascot, earning him residual pay.Brad is asked to move Dusty's motorcycle from the driveway so Sara can get her car out. Brad lied about knowing how to ride, so when he tries it out, he rides hard into the house, nearly hitting Sara and the kids, and ends up getting thrown into a wall while the motorcycle crashes out the house and onto Brad's car. Dusty punches a hole in the wall to get Brad out. Sara later calls a handyman named Griff (Hannibal Buress) to fix the damage. Dusty tells Brad to fire him since they can fix it themselves. Dusty uses both incidents to teach the kids lessons working against Brad's favor. Brad fires Griff and is mistaken for being racist.Dusty brings Griff back to make himself look good and to also fix the house while also building a treehouse in the back, along with a skate ramp, where Dusty shows off his moves. Brad, not wanting to be outdone, pulls out his old skateboard and attempts to do some moves, only to fly into the electrical wires and get electrocuted. Dusty prolongs Brad's pain to look heroic in front of the kids before he does CPR to revive him.Dusty gets into Brad's head by mentioning that Sara wants another baby, knowing Brad can't give her one. When he mentions it to Sara, she admits that she does want another baby, but she is still happy with Brad. They go get a check-up from Dusty's buddy Dr. Francisco (Bobby Cannavale) to see whether or not Brad can truly get Sara pregnant. This gives Dusty a good opportunity to show off just how much nicer his member is compared to Brad's. Brad later gets the news that he has a good chance of procreating successfully, to Dusty's dismay.Dylan comes home crying after getting bullied again. The men try to show the boy how to defend himself. Brad suggests dancing as an alternative, but even Sara wants Dylan to fight back. Brad talks about when he got bullied and lies about having punched a kid to get him to stop bothering him, but he admits the truth to Dylan and says he never fought anyone. This inspires Dylan to fight back so that he doesn't end up a wimp like Brad.Brad decides to step up his game to win the kids' approval by decorating the house with Christmas stuff, giving the kids a bunch of presents, like a pony for Megan, and tickets to a Lakers game, since they're Dylan's favorite team. Brad takes everyone to the game, but gets Dusty a seat away from him, Sara, and the kids. However, Dusty knows the Lakers' coach and even gets him to introduce Dylan to Kobe Bryant. Brad gets upset, but starts to flip out when he learns that Megan asked Dusty to go with her to the daddy-daughter dance, leading him to yell in front of everyone else and admit to Sara that he bought the tickets off a scalper for $18,000. Everyone but Brad gets to sit courtside. Brad drinks a bunch of beers and wins a chance to make a shot to win the family a vacation. Too drunk, Brad talks into the mic, announces he had sex with Sara to the whole arena, and then throws the ball and hits a cheerleader in the head. He grabs another ball and hits a kid in a wheelchair. He is taken out by four guys at once.Brad packs his stuff and is kicked out of the house, leaving Dusty to be the dad. Brad stays in his office while Dusty takes on parental responsibilities. It proves too much for Dusty, and he decides to bail and skip town. Griff goes to Brad's office and encourages him to return home and make it to Megan's dance.Brad rushes to find Dusty at the airport. Dusty admits he can't be a good parent, but Brad decides the two need to work together so they can both be good dads for Dylan and Megan. They make it to the dance, where Sara isn't happy with either of them. The men go to dance with Megan, only for her to tell them that Dylan is getting bullied by the 4th graders...all of whom are girls. Dylan punches the main girl in the face, kicks her in the groin, and calls her a bitch. Her dad (Bill Burr) gets involved and tries to fight the men. He punches Dusty, and Dusty gets ready to fight back, only to look around at the other girls and decide to dance instead, leading everyone else to continue dancing. Dylan ends up dancing with the 4th grader when everyone realizes that she was picking on him because she likes him.A while later, Brad and Sara have a baby of their own. Dusty has built his own home down the street with his residual pay and has gotten married to another woman named Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio), whom Sara is a little intimidated by. Dusty is trying to win Karen's daughter's approval. They receive a visit from Karen's ex, Roger (John Cena), who is twice as big as Dusty. Dusty immediately feels what Brad felt when he first saw Dusty. Dusty goes to greet Roger, only to get the cold shoulder... indicating that the cycle will start all over again."

She says that after the war, peace seemed unattainable. Now, she feels the opposite way, and that peace can be achieved so long as they purge the city of their one enemy - the Divergents. At the same time, Jeanine's men go to the Prior home in Abnegation and retrieve a box with a symbol of each faction on it, holding what is believed to be a message from the founders of the city. They need a Divergent to unlock it.Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) runs back to her home in Amity with her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and lover Four (Theo James). She approaches the residents of Amity, but they all stand away from her.

In reality, Tris is adjusting to Amity with Caleb, Four, Peter (Miles Teller), and Four's father Marcus (Ray Stevenson). Four remains distant from Marcus, despite how much he wants to talk to his son.During lunch, Tris talks about wanting to go back to Erudite and kill Jeanine to prevent more deaths from happening. Caleb argues that this is a bad idea. Peter makes a comment on not getting Caleb killed, just like how Tris got her parents killed. Enraged, Tris attacks Peter with a knife, cutting his cheek. The leader of Amity, Johanna Reyes (Octavia Spencer) calls Tris to her office, saying that her presence in what is supposed to be a peaceful community is distracting and that they may be asked to leave.

Tris, Four, and Caleb hide in the office, but Peter rats them out, forcing them to make a run for it. The soldiers aim their guns at them, and Marcus stands in their way, leading to him getting knocked out as Four watches. The three evade the soldiers and make it down to the train-tracks. Four holds the soldiers off and just manages to jump over the tracks before the train hits him.The three hop the train and encounter a large group of Factionless people led by Edgar (Jonny Weston). They violently attack the three after Edgar almost pushes Caleb off the train. In self-defense, Caleb ends up beating one Factionless to death, horrifying him. They stop attacking when Four says his name is Tobias Eaton. Knowing who he is, the Factionless take the three to their leader and Four's mother, Evelyn (Naomi Watts). She explains that she faked her death when Four was six because Marcus was too abusive, but she regrets leaving her son behind. Her plan is to unite the Factionless and Dauntless to fight back against Jeanine and her forces. Four refuses to have any part in his mother's plans.That night, Tris is sleeping with Four, when Evelyn appears in the doorway.

In Candor, Tris and Four reunite with the surviving Dauntless, including Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q).

Tris and Four are then apprehended and brought before the Candor leader Jack Kang (Daniel Dae Kim). He doesn't believe that they are truthful in what they say about Jeanine issuing the attacks and then framing them for crimes she committed. Four convinces Jack to let the two of them stand trial.Four is injected with a truth serum and stands before the Candors. He tells them how he joined Dauntless to escape his father's abuse and that he planned to join the Factionless until he fell in love with Tris. Tris goes up with the serum in her, but the more she resists telling the truth, the more it pains her. She then admits that she was responsible for the deaths of many, including her parents and Will, to the shock and anger of Christina.Back in Erudite, Jeanine is testing Divergents out to see who can unlock the box. She has a girl put in a simulation, but the girl dies. Jeanine determines that a particularly special Divergent must be brought to complete the task. Peter comes in and swears loyalty to Erudite. He tells Jeanine the best way to get Tris to give herself up is to play to her humanity.Tris stands on a rooftop where she is approached by a young man named Uriah (Keiynan Lonsdale). He engages in pleasant conversation with Tris when Eric and his soldiers invade and start shooting the Candors with a sim serum to the neck. He has people lined up and starts to scan them to see which Divergent it is that they need. Eric scans Uriah and sees he is 10% Divergent, and he executes him. Eric then scans a little girl who is 40% Divergent. Before he can shoot her, Tris pushes him over. Max comes over to scan Tris and sees she is 100% Divergent. Four shows up and fights Eric, bringing him to his knees with a gun to his head. Eric asks if Four can live with killing someone the way Eric already has. Four shoots him in the head.The sim serums activate on Christina, a young boy, and a girl named Marlene (Suki Waterhouse) as they stand over a ledge. They chant in unison for Tris to turn herself in or more will die. The three of them move closer as Tris and Tori run to rescue them. Tris grabs Christina and Tori grabs the boy, but Marlene falls over to her death.Four returns to Factionless to join his mother's cause against Erudite. A guilt-ridden Tris decides that she must turn herself in to Jeanine if she wants to prevent anymore deaths. Once she gets to Erudite, she is immediately taken in and brought to the sim room.Caleb, having rejoined Erudite, meets Tris in the sim room before it commences. He claims it is selfless of him to allow his sister to risk herself for the good of many. Tris is stuck with multiple wires and must go through a simulation of every faction to unlock the box. Her first test is a Dauntless sim. She is in the ruins of the city where she sees her mother in a building. The building catches fire, and Natalie calls Tris for help. Tris runs to her as the building starts to float into the air. She grabs a pipe and climbs to the top. She falls off briefly but manages to catch up and climb into the home to grab onto her mother. After she passes this, she must go through the Candor sim, in which she confesses to a sim of her mother that she is scared most of the time and just wishes to be safe again. All of a sudden, Four appears, breaking her out with others behind him. Tris gets a gun and faces Peter on the floor. She spares his life and keeps going. She then realizes that Four isn't real, and she passes the sim, belonging to Erudite. She also passed the Abnegation sim by sparing Peter's life. Tris starts to lose energy, and Jeanine reluctantly allows her to rest up before continuing.When the tests continue, Tris is put in the Amity sim, which puts her in a confrontation with Jeanine. Tris attacks her, and the building around her explodes and collapses, and she hit the ground after falling hundreds of feet. This causes her to appear dead, to Jeanine's frustration. Peter brings Tris's motionless body to Four, who reacts angrily toward Peter. Tris then gasps a breath of air, and Peter leads Four to attack the guards, now helping the heroes out.Peter gets into the computer system and lets Tris go through the Amity sim again. This time, she is forced to fight herself, as she is the one person she hates more than Jeanine. Sim-Tris taunts Real Tris over the deaths of her loved ones, but Real Tris knows she will eventually be able to forgive herself. After she passes this, the box is unlocked. Everyone sees what the message is - a woman (Janet McTeer) says that everyone in the city was part of an experiment to see if humanity can continue to thrive, and that the true saviors of this world would be the Divergents, so if one were to unlock this message, it would mean everyone is ready to go beyond the walls of the city. Knowing this would eliminate her power, Jeanine orders the box to be hidden from everyone, and for Tris and Four to be executed. The Factionless army then invades, seizing Jeanine and the box.The message is played throughout all the factions. Everybody starts heading toward the walls and outside the city. Tris is seen as a hero for leading them to a new discovery. Meanwhile, Jeanine watches from the window in her cell as everybody advances beyond the city. Evelyn comes in behind her. Jeanine says that after 200 years since the city came to be, she wonders what could be out there. Evelyn tells her she'll never find out, and she kills Jeanine with a bullet to the back of the head."

They all get together at Charlie Brown's (Noah Schnapp) house to start a hockey game. By the time Charlie puts on his winter clothes and comes outside, everyone has already left for the pond. Charlie decides to try flying his kite, since the Kite-Eating Tree is in hibernation. He gets the kite to fly, but everyone else is playing hockey, and they don't see him. The string tangles around his feet, and he gets dragged onto the pond, stopping right in front of Linus (Alex Garfin). A gust of wind catches the kite, and Charlie gets pulled across the pond, running into Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller), who was doing figure skating tricks. The wind carries the kite into the Tree, and Charlie gets tied up by the string.Snoopy (Bill Melendez) skates out and grabs Linus' blanket, whipping him around in circles. Reaching out, Linus grabs Sally's (Mariel Sheets) hand, and he sends her spinning into a snowbank. ""Isn't he the cutest thing?"" she sighs. Snoopy is still dragging Linus, and he grabs Peppermint Patty (Venus Schultheis), whose stick snags Marcie (Rebecca Bloom). Others join in, starting a game of crack-the-whip. Frieda, Shermy (William Alexander Wunsch), Schroeder (Noah Johnston), Lucy, Franklin (Marleik Mar Mar Walker) and Pigpen (A.J. Tecce) zoom across the ice, passing by Woodstock (Bill Melendez), who is driving a Zamboni. When the whip cracks, the kids are scattered across the pond. Charlie frees himself from the tree and walks to the baseball diamond, still untangling the kite string from his legs. When he's done, the string is the size of a baseball, and he decides to practice his pitching. He builds snowmen for a team and a batter, and then pitches a snowball. To his surprise, the ball comes right back at him, knocking him out of his clothes. ""It's going to be a long winter,"" he groans.Charlie sees a moving truck pull up to the house across the street from his. Everyone runs up to see who is moving in, blocking Charlie's view. He rolls up a snow mound and stands on top of it to see, but then he loses his balance and crashes the fence. ""He did it,"" say the other kids, pointing to Charlie, who runs back into his house.The next day, the snow is gone, and the kids go back to school. Snoopy tries to get into school, but he is stopped by Franklin. Everyone sits down for class, and Charlie sees Linus' show-and-tell project, a World War I diorama featuring the Red Baron. He spins the tiny propeller, causing the plane to start up and take the whole thing flying out the window. The teacher, Miss Othmar, tells everyone that the new kid will be joining the class. The Little Red-Haired Girl (Francesca Capaldi) walks in and takes a seat, causing Charlie to be mesmerized. Then Miss Othmar announces that the class will be taking a standardized test. Snoopy crawls through a vent and uses a yo-yo to rappel into a classroom chair. Smiling, he takes a binder and fills it with papers, but then he pinches his finger in the rings, letting out a howl. Lucy throws him out of the building, and he lands in the trash, finding an old typewriter. The Red-Haired Girl finishes her test and hands it in, and her pencil falls off her desk and rolls up to Charlie's feet.

He starts writing a few times, and each time he tears out the paper and crumples it up. Then, Linus' plane goes flying by, and Snoopy is inspired. ""It was a dark and stormy night. Thunder roared. Lightning flashed in the sky. High above the French countryside, the World War I Flying Ace had never been so close to his lifelong enemy, the Red Baron!"" Snoopy puts on goggles and a scarf, and his doghouse becomes a plane, chasing after the Baron. Imagining that the Baron is on his tail, Snoopy does evasive maneuvers, losing his balance and falling off the doghouse and into his water dish. Woodstock laughs heartily, but Snoopy climbs back up, not to be deterred.Charlie quickly gets off the bus at his house, and hides behind the doghouse as the Red-Haired Girl walks home. Thinking that Charlie is being a spy, Snoopy follows behind her, staying out of sight. In his room, Charlie pulls down the blinds, then opens them a bit to watch her check the mailbox, and then walk to her door. Snoopy realizes that his story should be a love story.""Chapter One: It Was the Greatest Story Ever Told.The Flying Ace emerged from the airport wearing his green cap, red scarf, and goggles. But when he saw his plane, he gasped. He couldn't believe his eyes. This was a disaster!The plane was in a shambles! Parts were scattered everywhere. He approached Woodstock, the leader of his flight crew. Woodstock started chirping orders to his team of mechanics--young birds loyal to the Flying Ace.There was a flurry of action as the crew quickly fixed the plane. The Flying Ace stood behind it, inspecting it, as Woodstock turned the propeller.POOF! A cloud of black smoke shot out, covering the Flying Ace. Woodstock glared at his team of mechanics.The sound of an airplane engine filled the air. It was coughing and sputtering. The Flying Ace looked up to see a white plane chugging across the sky. Black smoke trailed from the tail. The plane was in trouble, and was coming down for a landing.As it got closer, the Flying Ace saw that the plane was a White Albatross. A real beauty. The pilot flew her in for a safe, expert landing.The Flying Ace walked toward the plane. The pilot stepped out and removed her flying cap to reveal the lovely face of a French poodle. The Flying Ace's mouth dropped.Her name was Fifi. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.Fifi moved to the front of her plane and removed one of the panels. She pulled out a wrench and got to work fixing the engine. A smudge of grease appeared on her cheek, but the Flying Ace thought it only made her look more beautiful. She was gorgeous, and she could fix an engine!Suddenly, the Flying Ace felt self-conscious. He rubbed most of the grease spots (but not all) from his own fur. Then he ran to the grass and picked some purple flowers. He turned to go back to the plane, but Fifi was already taking off again.The Flying Ace watched in awe as Fifi flew off toward the horizon--right through a heart-shaped cloud.He was in love. But when would he ever see her again?""Charlie decides to bring the Red-Haired Girl a housewarming gift, and Snoopy hands him a flower. He walks up to the door, but turns away without ringing the bell. Snoopy rings it for him and bolts. The Red-Haired Girl opens the door and doesn't see anyone there. Charlie has hidden behind a plant. She shrugs and shuts the door. Charlie walks to Lucy's house, where she has a cardboard stand with a sign reading ""Psychiatric Advice, 5 cents."" Charlie asks her how he can impress the Red-Haired Girl, and she tells him that girls are impressed by a boy who is a winner. She hands him a book called ""10 Ways to Become a Winner,"" then taps her cup. He drops in a coin, and she says, ""Ah, nickels, nickels, nickels. What a beautiful sound!""The next day, Charlie is reading the book. ""Congratulations, you're on your way to becoming a winner! Step One: Forget everything you know about yourself. Step Two: Project confidence!"" Charlie tries to strike a confident pose, with Snoopy copying him. ""Don't slouch!"" Charlie straightens his back. ""Maintain eye contact at all times."" Charlie looks into the mirror and sees Snoopy, and they have a staring contest, which Snoopy wins. Charlie hears a crash downstairs and finds Sally practicing with a lasso for the school talent contest. Charlie decides that winning the contest will impress the Red-Haired Girl, so he and Snoopy put together a magic act.Schroeder starts off the contest playing Beethoven on the piano. Backstage, Charlie sees Lucy, who gets licked by Snoopy. ""Ugh! I've been kissed by a dog! I have dog germs! Get some disinfectant! Get some iodine!"" Onstage, Peppermint Patty is karate chopping some boards. It's Sally's turn to perform, and the audience laughs at her rodeo act. She freezes up, and Charlie comes out in a cow costume and tells her to rope him. She jumps on Snoopy's back and chases Charlie around the stage. The crowd goes wild and snaps pictures of a tied up Charlie in costume.The next day, Charlie's picture is on the front of the school newspaper. When he walks into the cafeteria, everyone says, ""Moo!"" Back at home, Charlie remembers a line from the book. ""Number Six: Tell yourself 'I am worthy. I can do this. I have what it takes.'"" Just then, he gets a phone call from Peppermint Patty. She tells him that she volunteered him to make cupcakes for the Winter Dance. From his window, he sees the Red-Haired Girl dancing in her room, and decides to learn how to dance himself, spending days practicing with Snoopy.At the dance, the boys are on one side of the gym, and the girls are on the other side. Sally drags Linus to the middle and dances with him, and the other kids join in. Outside, Charlie walks up to the door with a tray of cupcakes and steels himself for his entrance. He doesn't notice Snoopy gobbling up the cupcakes until they're gone. Marcie is struggling with a heavy punch bowl, and Charlie grabs it for her. Then, the door shuts on his shirt, trapping him with the bowl still in his hands. A contest starts to decide the best boy and girl dancer, with the two winners sharing a dance at the end. The girls start, and Charlie can't see the Red-Haired Girl's dance, but he hears everyone applaud for her. Then, it's the boys' turn. Charlie is still stuck in the door, until Snoopy bursts through wearing sunglasses and a ""Joe Cool"" shirt. Charlie spills most of the punch on the floor, but finally gets the bowl to the table. The other boys do their dance, and Charlie is the last one. He gracefully dances across the floor, and everyone claps for him. Then he slips on the spilled punch, causing his shoe to come off and hit the fire sprinkler. Water comes down and everyone runs out of the gym.Dripping wet, Charlie walks home with Snoopy. Moved by Charlie's sadness, Snoopy starts typing.""The Flying Ace took to the air, in search of his long-lost love, Fifi.He flew across the sky, keeping his eyes peeled for her white plane. Finally, he spotted her! Fifi, piloting her White Albatross, was flying right toward him. Her eyes widened when she saw him.The Flying Ace steered his plane next to Fifi's. She looked over at him and smiled. He did a loop in the sky to impress her. When he finished, Fifi steered her plane into a DOUBLE loop.Then she took off in front of the Flying Ace, and he followed her. The two planes looped and dipped in the sky. Then they both dropped down and flew across a green valley below.Fifi held up a camera and started snapping photos of the Flying Ace in his plane. He hammed it up, striking poses for her--which is why he didn't see the old barn up ahead.WHOOSH! The Flying Ace zipped through the barn and came out the other side covered in hay. He flashed an embarrassed smile at Fifi, and she smiled back.Fifi steered up and grabbed a piece of cloud with her hand. Then she blew on it, and it formed the shape of a heart. It floated across the sky toward the Flying Ace.He responded by rolling his plane above the valley. When the plane was upright again, the Flying Ace held flowers in his hand. He flew up next to Fifi and extended them toward her.BOOM! The flowers exploded! Startled, Fifi and the Flying Ace looked behind them.A red plane circled them and then flew across their path. The Red Baron!He flew off into the distance, but the Flying Ace gave chase.Then the Red Baron set his sights on Fifi's plane.He steered right on top of the White Albatross. Then he dipped down and punctured her wing with his wheel. Fifi's damaged plane suddenly rolled over!Taken by surprise, Fifi fell out of the cockpit! The Flying Ace dove down with a shriek, determined to save her.Just before he reached her, Fifi pulled the string on her parachute. She shot up in the air as the chute blew open.The Flying Ace banked hard, flying straight up to try to reach Fifi. As she slowly began to float back toward the ground, the Red Baron zoomed toward her.Both pilots raced toward Fifi. At the last second the Red Baron's wing snagged the string of the parachute. Then he flew off, with Fifi dangling from his wing!The Flying Ace flew as fast as he could toward the Red Baron. The villain headed toward a large mountain. A long bridge with train tracks led into a dark tunnel inside the mountain. A train was chugging across the bridge, headed for the tunnel.ZOOM! The Red Baron zipped inside the tunnel just before the train. The Flying Ace followed him.Then Fifi's pink scarf flew out of the tunnel, covering the face of the Flying Ace! He ripped it off, but he was too late. The craggy face of the mountain was quickly approaching...""Woodstock tears the paper out of the typewriter, seeing the scared look on Snoopy's face. Snoopy takes another look at the last line he wrote.""He thought he had lost her forever.""The next day at school, the Red-Haired Girl's desk is empty. Linus tells Charlie that she went to take care of her grandmother. The teacher announces that she is assigning a team book report, and the partners will be drawn from a bag. Lucy keeps picking names until she ends up with Schroeder. Charlie walks up and picks the Red-Haired Girl from the bag. In the cafeteria, he panics and tells Linus that he can't handle being her partner. He decides to do the report himself while she's gone. Everyone leaves the cafeteria to look at the test scores that are just being posted. Charlie sees that he was the only one to get a perfect score. Over the PA, Franklin announces that there will be an assembly to honor Charlie.In art class, Charlie is supposed to be making a sculpture out of hangers, but it just becomes a big mess. Franklin compliments him on his ""contemporary"" piece. After school, the kids play hockey, and Charlie shoots the puck. It flies off the pond and bounces off a tree trunk, coming back onto the pond and landing in the net. His teammates cheer for him, except for Lucy, who knows something is wrong.In the morning, Sally gives the other kids a tour of Charlie's house. At the bus stop, a group of kids is waiting for him. Snoopy and Woodstock escort him onto the bus, wearing Secret Service uniforms. At school, a lot of kids are wearing his style of shirt. Pigpen reminds him that the book report is due on Monday, just a few days away. Charlie decides to ask Marcie for help. Marcie is at the pond, trying to get Peppermint Patty to decide on a book, but she just wants to shoot pucks. Frustrated, Marcie leaves for the library. Charlie shows up looking for her, and Peppermint Patty says that Marcie recommended the book ""Leo's Toy Store"" by Warren Peace.Charlie goes to the library and finds Marcie there. She points out ""War and Peace"" and Charlie is amazed at how long it is. Charlie checks out the book and puts it into a sled, dragging it home. He spends the whole weekend reading, finishing as the sun sets on Sunday. As he writes the report, the pen he's using breaks, covering everything with ink. He picks up the Red-Haired Girl's pencil and starts again. He finishes just before he has to get ready for school.At the assembly, Charlie sees the Red-Haired Girl in the audience. Lucy walks up and tells him she may have been wrong about him all along. Franklin calls him up to the stage, and Marcie reads a proclamation that it is Charlie Brown Day. Then she pins a gold medal to his shirt, and hands him his test paper. He realizes that he put his name at the top of Peppermint Patty's test. He decides to be honest and gives back the medal, and he walks out alone. Linus reminds him that things could go better when he hands in his book report. Charlie places the report on one side of a seesaw. Just then, the Red-Haired Girl walks up, and Linus tells her that Charlie did the report for both of them. She smiles at Charlie, who leans on the seesaw to steady himself. The report goes flying into the air, and then is ripped to shreds by Linus' plane. Charlie places a pile of confetti in the Red-Haired Girl's hands and runs off.Seeing Charlie's frustration, Snoopy goes back to the typewriter.""Chapter Four: Curse You, Red Baron!Woodstock and his mechanics cranked a siren--the Red Baron had been spotted in the skies!The Flying Ace jumped into his plane and took off into the air. He chased the Red Baron all the way from the countryside to the city of Paris. He never lost sight of the red plane. He followed it past the Eiffel Tower and the cathedral at Notre-Dame.The Red Baron looped around and flew back to the Eiffel Tower. He pulled up at the last second, flying vertically up the side of the tower. The Flying Ace flew right beneath him. A drip of oil spilled from the Red Baron's plane, splashing the Flying Ace in the face. He shook his head, sending the droplets flying.The Red Baron looped and quickly flew back down along the Eiffel Tower, startling the Flying Ace. He tried to make the same sharp turn, but his plane got stuck on the point of the Eiffel Tower! He stood up and stomped on his plane, freeing it. His plane plummeted toward the ground, but he pulled up hard at the last minute.The Red Baron's plane was a red dot in the distance now, and it was growing dark as night fell and a fog set in. But the Flying Ace was not going to give up. He bravely flew into the gloomy fog, chasing the Red Baron.When the fog lifted, he realized he was behind enemy lines. He could see the barbed wire of the enemy camp below. Then he looked up--and realized he was flying right underneath the Red Baron! His enemy could not see him. It was the perfect cover!The Flying Ace and the Red Baron flew until they reached the Baron's aerodrome. Enemy planes patrolled the skies. Suddenly, spotlights shone on the Flying Ace's plane, and sirens began to wail.The Flying Ace began to descend to avoid the spotlights. Up ahead he saw a wooden tower. There, inside, was Fifi!Their eyes met. The Flying Ace circled the tower. Then Fifi pointed behind him, and he turned around to look.The Red Baron was on his tail!The Flying Ace gasped. His plane was hit! He was going down!He stood on top of his plane and saluted. She had served him well. Smoke poured from the engines as he landed in the middle of the enemy aerodrome.The Flying Ace took cover behind the plane as spotlights shone on him. Shading his eyes from the brightness, he saw a zeppelin flying overhead. Fifi sadly waved out the window of the airship. The Flying Ace watched helplessly as it soared away, accompanied by the Red Baron and his squadron of enemy planes, the Flying Circus.Things were grim. It looked like all was lost.But he would not give up. The Red Baron could not win! Fifi was counting on him.The Flying Ace stormed off into the dark night.""Charlie goes to his room and shoves his kite, his baseball glove and Lucy's book underneath his bed. Then he takes the Red-Haired Girl's pencil and sticks it in a drawer. As the sun sets, Charlie sees a single star light up the sky. He imagines it to be his star, saying to him, ""Don't give up, kid.""""The Flying Ace knew he had to rescue Fifi.""Snoopy strolls through the neighborhood, looking for inspiration to finish his story. He hears piano music coming from Schroeder's house, and howls along with it. He climbs across a string of Christmas lights outside of Peppermint Patty's house, but she chases him away. For the rest of the winter, Snoopy doesn't write, and Charlie doesn't try to talk to the Red-Haired Girl.In the spring, Charlie is walking past a tree when a kite lands at his feet. He sees a kid on a ladder trying to fly it. The kid asks him if he's ever flown one before. He tells the kid to get a good running start, keep the string tight, and never give up.""Chapter Seven: Never Give Up!The Flying Ace knew he could never give up on her. He could never give up on himself.He repaired his plane and flew back to the aerodrome. Then he gathered his own squadron of Sopwith Camel planes. They took off in the darkness of night, headed for the ocean.Early the next morning the Flying Ace spotted the huge zeppelin up ahead, glinting in the sunlight. He zoomed toward it. The Red Baron's squadron turned and headed toward the Flying Ace and the Sopwith Camels.As the Flying Ace flew closer to the zeppelin, he could see Fifi staring out the window of the carriage of the airship. They locked eyes. He surged forward to rescue her.Then an enemy plane appeared behind him! The Flying Ace ducked to avoid it, but the plane was hot on his tail.CRASH!Fifi smashed a chair through the window. It hit the enemy plane, sending it crashing into one of the airship's big propellers.The Flying Ace flew back to Fifi, but her eyes were wide with fear. He looked behind him to see the Red Baron coming toward him at superspeed.The Red Baron fired. The Flying Ace dodged the spray, and the bullets hit the airship instead. The Flying Ace didn't notice.He flew away from the dogfight, hoping the Red Baron would follow him. The villain took the bait. He followed the Flying Ace away from the ocean, back to land...where another member of the Flying Ace's team was waiting.Then Woodstock leaped from the Flying Ace's plane and landed on a wing of the red plane. He quickly began to unhook the hinged panels on the wings that helped the plane remain steady in the air. The Red Baron's plane lurched.BONK!One of the panels hit Woodstock, sending him spiraling away. But he righted himself and gave the Flying Ace a thumbs-up before he flew away. The Flying Ace nodded, then dove toward the Red Baron's damaged plane.At the same time, Fifi noticed the damage to the airship. The envelope was swiftly deflating, and the broken propeller was sputtering and groaning. The zeppelin wouldn't stay aloft much longer. She looked for a way out and spotted an escape hatch on the ceiling. She opened it and poked out her head. The wind blew across her face.She grabbed on to a rope and climbed on top of the carriage, slowly making her way across the top. The damaged propeller broke loose, and she stumbled. She hung onto the rope, dangling over the side of the zeppelin!Meanwhile, the Flying Ace had the Red Baron in his sights. He closed in on him--and then he heard Fifi's scream. He looked over just as the carriage detached from the airship, and Fifi plummeted toward the ground.Finish off the Red Baron forever, or save his one true love? There was only one choice he could make. He sped off after Fifi as the Red Baron escaped.Fifi flailed her arms and legs as she fell through the clouds. Then suddenly the Flying Ace's plane was underneath her, and she fell right into his arms. The Flying Ace gazed into her eyes and then looked behind him to see the Red Baron's plane disappear, a cloud of black smoke trailing behind it.The Flying Ace and Fifi came in to land, setting down among the squad of Sopwith Camels. The pilots cheered for their hero. The battle was over--for now.And so, as our hero observed, he was destined to face the Red Baron another day.""Charlie and Sally are walking to school on the last day. There's a carnival set up by the pond. Linus tells everyone that there will be a pen pal project over the summer. He picks names out, and people will call out if they want to be that person's pen pal. Linus calls Charlie's name, and there's silence in the room. ""I will."" Charlie looks up and sees the Red-Haired Girl. When school ends, everyone runs to the carnival. Charlie wonders why the Red-Haired Girl picked him. Linus tells him to go ask her. He goes to his room and grabs her pencil, and then walks over to her house and rings the doorbell. Her mom answers and tells him that she got on a bus to summer camp.Frantically, Charlie runs through the neighborhood to get to the bus. He makes it to a fence with a hole, but an ice cream truck surrounded by kids blocks off the hole. Desperately, he asks for a little help for once in his life. Just then, the Kite-Eating Tree lets go of a kite, and the string wraps around Charlie's leg. Then, the wind blows the kite upward, carrying Charlie over the fence. Charlie runs toward the bus, with the wind carrying the kite behind him. Everyone sees Charlie apparently flying the kite, and runs after him. He gets to the bus and finds the Red-Haired Girl. He asks her why she picked him, and she replies that she admires the type of person he is. ""An insecure, wishy-washy boy?""""That's not who you are at all. You showed compassion for your sister at the talent show. Honesty at the assembly. And at the dance, you were brave yet funny. And what you did for me, doing the book report while I was away, was so sweet of you.""The other kids start to tear up. ""So you see, when I look at you, I don't see an insecure, wishy-washy boy at all.""The bus honks its horn. ""Sorry, I have to go now.""""Wait. I think this belongs to you."" He pulls out her pencil.""Oh, thank you. I've been looking everywhere for this."" She climbs on the bus. ""I'll write to you, pen pal!""As the bus pulls away, she waves goodbye from the window. The kids congratulate Charlie. Lucy walks up to him. ""This time you've really gone and done it, you blockhead! You've shown a whole new side to yourself. Good ol' Charlie Brown."""
The Good Dinosaur,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979388/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a world where dinosaurs and humans live side-by-side, an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend. ""The Good Dinosaur"" asks the question: What if the asteroid that forever changed life on Earth missed the planet completely and giant dinosaurs never became extinct? In this epic journey into the world of dinosaurs, an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend. While travelling through a harsh and mysterious landscape, Arlo learns the power of confronting his fears and discovers what he is truly capable of.—Pixar After a lot of accidents that changed the usual form of his happy and joyful family, Arlo, an apatosaurus, formed a distant and accidental relationship with a brave young primitive boy in a world that dinosaurs successfully live until the Prehistoric age.—Gusde After young apotosauras Arlo's father getting washed away by a flood. He blames a cave kid named Spot for killing him. Spot suddenly knocks Arlo into the river and Arlo gets washed away and gets lost in the woods. Arlo then later turns from scared to brave, and he becomes friends with Spot, and Arlo then meets a clan of T-Rexes who find Arlo's way home. Can Arlo be the bravest living dinosaur or will he sometimes still be afraid? Young Arlo is afraid of everything. Has been since the day he was hatched. But he's forced to find the courage he never knew he had after his father is killed. After falling into the river near his home, Arlo must find his way home. Along the way, he learns what love and courage really mean with the help of some interesting encounters with other dinosaurs.—momamedienta 65 million years ago, an asteroid made its way out of the belt and sped toward Earth. It turned red as it entered the atmosphere, and then it sped past, missing the planet entirely. Millions of years later, two Apaterosauruses named Henry (Jeffrey Wright) and Ida (Frances McDormand) are busy cultivating a field next to a river at the base of Clawtooth Mountain. Henry sprays the crops with water from his mouth, when Ida calls out, ""It's time!"" She has a large egg and two small ones in her nest, and the small ones hatch first, giving them a boy and a girl, Buck (Marcus Scribner) and Libby. The large egg still doesn't hatch, so Buck hits it with a stick. The top pops off, and they look inside and see a tiny dinosaur clinging to the egg. Slowly, Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) climbs out and tries to walk, awkwardly falling over at first. Henry shows them all the farm and the mountain, saying they will all take care of it together.At the age of five, Buck and Libby are helping out with the chores, but Arlo's fear made him hate his chore of feeding the chickens. Ida puts a bucket of corn around his neck and coaxes him into the coop. He sees a chick trapped in some weeds and frees him, only to have the mother chicken come up behind him and squawk loudly. Scared, Arlo runs into the silo, where Henry is storing corn. He seals the door with a boulder, keeping the food safe from scavengers. Ida tells him he should make his mark, and he presses his foot down in the mud and stamps it on a rock, then places it on top of the silo. He tells Ida to make her mark, since she made the cabin, the fence and three children. Henry tells the kids they have to earn the right to make their mark, by doing something big, for something bigger than themselves.When they are ten, Buck and Libby have earned their marks by clearing trees and plowing a field. But Arlo still hasn't done anything to earn his mark. Arlo is determined to complete his chore, but Buck plays a prank on him, scaring him off before he can finish. Henry decides to take Arlo out into the field at night, telling him to walk to the middle. A bug lands on his nose, and he screams for his dad. Henry walks up and blows on the bug, revealing it to be a firefly. ""Sometimes, you gotta get through your fear to see the beauty on the other side,"" he tells Arlo. Then he waves his tail through the grass, causing more fireflies to pop out. Excited, Arlo does the same thing. Then Henry tells him that he has a special chore for Arlo, so he can make his mark.The next day, Henry takes Arlo to the silo and tells him that there's a critter climbing over the fence and stealing the corn. He tells Arlo that his chore is to catch it, then shows him how to build a trap with a rope and net, and an ear of corn on the ground for bait. Using a pumpkin for demonstration, he tells Arlo that when he smashes the critter with a mallet, then he'll be able to make his mark.Later, Arlo hears the sound of the trap. With the mallet in hand, he approaches and sees a human child (Jack Bright) trapped and choking with the net wrapped around his neck. Arlo sighs and lets the boy go, but the boy approaches him, sniffing around. Arlo backs away, tripping over a rock and letting out a scream. Startled, the boy runs off as Henry runs over. Henry sees the boy escaping and yells at Arlo for letting him go. Henry tells Arlo to come with him as he follows the boy's tracks. Just then, it started to rain. Arlo worries that they'll get lost, but Henry tells him that as long as he can find the river, he can find home. Henry tells Arlo that the boy's tracks are getting washed out in the rain, so they have to move quickly. Lightning and thunder are crackling all around them, and Arlo slips and falls in the mud. Henry tells him that they should head home. Just then, a landslide causes the river to overflow. Henry uses his strength to push Arlo to safety, before being swept away.With Henry gone, Ida and the kids struggle to keep up with the chores. Arlo takes corn into the silo for the winter, but he finds the boy eating it. Arlo chases after him, grabbing an ear of corn from his mouth. As they struggle, Arlo falls into the river and cries for help, but nobody hears him. Careening down the river, Arlo smacks his head against a large rock and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up lying on a sandbar, and sees that he's miles from home. The only sound he can hear is a howl coming from the boy, and he sees him at the top of a cliff. The boy watches as Arlo awkwardly climbs up the cliff, then he jumps on Arlo's face. Arlo shakes him off, and then climbs up to the cliff edge, when he sees that the boy has disappeared.Arlo climbs up to the top of a ridge, trying to find home. He sees the river, and remembers Henry's words. After walking up the river for a while, he sees a berry tree, and balances on a rock to get the berries. He loses his balance and falls, landing with a pile of rocks trapping his leg. Stuck, he closes his eyes and falls asleep. The next morning, the sound of geysers wakes him up, and he sees that the rocks have been moved, freeing his leg. He sees human tracks, and wonders if it was the boy who helped him. As he resumes walking up the river, heavy rain comes down. Arlo sees all the other animals take shelter, but he has none. He hears a rattle in the bushes, and the boy comes out and offers him a lizard, and then a bug. Arlo has no interest in eating either one. Then the boy brings back some berries, and Arlo happily eats them. He asks the boy if he knows where to find more, not sure if the boy understands. The boy runs off, and Arlo follows him to a cliff ledge. Arlo falls over, with his mouth gripping one edge and his legs on the other. The boy uses Arlo for a bridge, and then shows him a berry bush. Arlo flings himself to the other side, then runs toward the bush. Just then, a snake falls out and attacks Arlo. The boy grabs the snake's tail and starts to gnaw on its skin. The snake slithers away, and Arlo realizes the boy had saved him.Together, Arlo and the boy are walking up the river, when Arlo hears a voice say hello. Looking around, he finds a Styracosaurus with big horns. His name is Forrest Woodbush. Small creatures are perched all over the horns, and he says they are there to protect him. He saw the boy protect Arlo, and says he could use the boy as another protector. Arlo tells Forrest the boy is with him, and Forrest asks what the boy's name is. Arlo says he doesn't know, and Forrest says, ""I name him, I keep him."" They both start calling out names, getting no response. Arlo yells out, ""Spot!"" and the boy looks up at him. ""Come here, Spot!"" The boy walks up to Arlo. Forrest tells him not to lose Spot on his way back to Clawtooth Mountain.Walking back, they hear a squeak and see a gopher popping its head out of a hole. Spot tries to pounce, but the animal quickly ducks back down. Spot puts his mouth to the hole and blows, causing a gopher to pop out, and then scurry back in. Arlo does the same thing, causing more gophers to pop out. Displeased, the gophers bite Arlo, causing him and Spot to run for safety. They find themselves on a ledge above the river. Another gopher bites Arlo, sending him down into the river. He struggles to stay afloat, and Spot dives in after him and demonstrates how to swim. Arlo catches on and swims to shore with Spot. Arlo realizes his body is covered with leeches and tries to shake them off. Spot helps peel off the stubborn ones. They continue walking and find some fruit, and both eat heartily. Then they start to hallucinate, realizing there was something in the fruit. Tired, they both fall asleep.They wake up at night, and walk through a meadow. Arlo waves his tail through the grass, causing fireflies to pop up. Excited, Spot tries to grab them, catching one in his hands. Arlo blows on it, making it light up, and Spot lets it go. Arlo says he misses his family, and Spot tilts his head in confusion. Arlo breaks some sticks and makes dinosaur shapes, saying that one is him, and the rest are Buck and Libby, and Momma and Poppa. Then he draws a circle around them and says they are his family. Spot grabs some sticks and makes three human shapes, then draws a circle around them. Arlo tells him that's his family. Spot lays two figures flat on the ground and covers them with dirt. Arlo does the same with his Poppa figure. Together, they howl sadly at the moon.The next day, they resume walking up the river, when a violent storm hits them. Arlo curls up under a fallen tree, with Spot following him. When it ends, Arlo climbs out and sees destruction everywhere, and he realizes he can't find the river. In the sky, he sees pterodactyls flying in formation, like a search-and-rescue team. Arlo calls out to them, but Spot scurries off and hides. Thunderclap, Downpour and Coldfront land next to Arlo, and offer to lead him back to Clawtooth Mountain. They find an animal trapped under a fallen tree, and Arlo helps them clear the tree away. Thunderclap picks up the animal, but instead of letting it go, he throws it into his mouth and swallows it. Scared, Arlo looks around and sees Spot hiding beneath some debris. The pterodactyls can smell him, and they ask Arlo where he is. Arlo tries to misdirect them, but when he nervously glances in Spot's direction, Thunderclap flies over to him. Spot runs away, with Thunderclap giving chase. Arlo runs over, and Spot jumps on his back. Arlo sees a long-necked dinosaur grazing and calls out for help, but then he sees that it's actually two T. rexes.Trapped between the pterodactyls and the now-charging T. rexes, Arlo curls up into a ball over Spot. Suddenly, the T. rexes attack the pterodactyls and drive them away, and then they approach Arlo. He's frozen with fear, but the T. rexes help him up, and introduce themselves as Ramsey, a girl, and Nash, her brother. Their father, Butch, walks up and Arlo sees a giant scar on his face. Arlo asks him for help getting home, but Butch tells him they don't have time to help, since they're trying to find their herd of longhorns. Arlo offers to let Spot sniff out the herd, in return for helping him back home. Spot is able to find their tracks, but feathers on the ground indicate that the herd was taken by rustlers. Following the tracks, they find the herd grazing in a nearby field. Knowing the rustlers are lying in wait, Butch tells Arlo to stand on a rock near the herd and scream, and then stand still when the rustlers charge toward him. Nervously, Arlo heads to the rock with Spot. He tries to scream, but his fear made him silent. Spot chomps his leg, and he lets out a pained yell. Three raptors rustle through the grass, and walk up to Arlo. They tell him he's trespassing, and they take care of trespassers by killing them. A raptor strikes, but the T. rexes jump in and fight them. Butch head-butts a raptor, sending him flying into the herd, who stampede straight toward Arlo.Arlo takes off running with Spot, and the T. rexes try to keep up with the herd. A raptor jumps on Nash, and they fight, with the raptor pinning Nash down. Just as he is about to strike, Ramsey hits him with a tail-whip, sending him flying away. Arlo runs behind a boulder to escape the stampede, but the raptors can smell him nearby. Butch charges in, but he gets pinned to the ground by two raptors. Summoning his courage, Arlo charges in and head-butts a raptor away, and Butch grabs the other by the tail and flings her off. Arlo joins the T. rexes in driving the herd to a safer place.That night, Arlo, Spot and the T. rexes gather around a campfire. Arlo sees a cut on his forearm, and Ramsey tells him that it will leave a good scar. Nash shows a scar on his calf, and says he got it fighting fifteen Stegosauruses. Ramsey says that once he was trapped with his tail stuck under a rock and a herd of longhorns coming straight at him, so he had to gnaw his tail off. He shows the stub where his tail was. Arlo asks Butch how he got his scar, and he says he was taking a drink from a pond, when crocodiles jumped out of the water and bit his face. He bit one crocodile in half, tail-whipped another one, and then drowned a third one in his blood. Then he opens his mouth and shows off a crocodile tooth lodged in his jaw. Arlo says that his Poppa wasn't scared of anything, and that he's done being scared. Butch tells him that he was scared when the crocodiles attacked him, and that fear can make you find out what you're made of. Just then, the first snow falls, and Arlo tells them he needs to get home, to prepare the food for winter.The next morning, the T. rexes herd the longhorns on, and when a group splits off, Arlo runs ahead and snaps off a tree with his tail to force them back. Going over a slope, Arlo sees the peaks of Clawtooth Mountain, and the T. rexes say goodbye to him. When Arlo gets close to home, he lets out a happy howl, and Spot joins him. Suddenly, they hear another person howl back. Arlo can't stand the thought of losing Spot, so he scoops Spot up and walks back to the river. A storm comes in, and Arlo's feet get stuck in the mud. Looking up, he sees the pterodactyls flying around. They fly in and attack Arlo with their wings, and Thunderclap snatches up Spot in his talons. The other two turn to Arlo, who tries to back away, but he loses his balance in the mud and falls into brambles below. He tries to get free, but the brambles tighten around him. Unable to get through to Arlo, the pterodactyls fly after Thunderclap and Spot. Arlo tries one more time to free himself, but a rock comes loose and hits him in the head, knocking him unconscious.When he comes to, he sees someone chopping the brambles in half, and realizes it's Poppa. He tells Arlo they have to go home, but Arlo wants to save Spot. Poppa keeps walking forward, and Arlo yells at him to stop. Then he sees that Poppa isn't leaving any footprints. Arlo tells Poppa that he has to go save Spot, because he loves him. Poppa says he knew Arlo had it in him, and then fades away into the rain. Arlo is still tangled in the brambles, but with renewed determination, he breaks them one by one, and he runs after Spot.Arlo climbs up the mountain and howls for Spot, and he hears Spot howl back. He sees Spot inside a hollow tree, surrounded by pterodactyls. They whack the tree, trying to get Spot out. Arlo charges in and head-butts a pterodactyl into the river. Thunderclap and the others lift Arlo into the air, and Spot howls from the tree. Thunderclap flies down to Spot, who goes deeper into the tree. Still in the air, Arlo whacks a tree and makes it fall, landing on the pterodactyls. Arlo falls to the ground, and another pterodactyl flies toward him. Arlo grabs a tree with his tail and flings it into the pterodactyl, knocking it into the water. Arlo sees Thunderclap still attacking Spot, so he runs up and lets out a loud roar, scaring Thunderclap away.A flash flood approaches, and the tree with Spot inside gets swept away. Arlo tries to save him, but he can't reach far enough. The flood causes debris to fall, knocking Arlo into the river. Struggling to swim, he sees Spot unconscious inside the sinking tree. Arlo swims to him, hearing a waterfall ahead. When he reaches Spot, he curls himself around Spot and they both go over the edge.At the bottom, Arlo pulls Spot out of the water, and Spot opens his eyes. Arlo puts his head down and breathes a sigh of relief. The next day, they resume walking home, when they hear a human man howl. They see a woman and two children join him on the hill. Arlo slowly approaches, and Spot jumps off his back. The father sniffs Spot and rubs his hair, and the family gathers around him. Spot jumps on Arlo's back, ready to keep going, but Arlo pushes him off. Arlo draws a circle on the ground around all of them, and Spot understands. Arlo hugs Spot and says goodbye.Arlo walks the rest of the way alone, seeing the farm in the distance with the harvest still on the ground. Momma, Buck and Libby were tired, but still working. Momma looks up and sees Arlo walking toward her. ""Arlo!"" she cries, and all of them run up and hug him.At the top of the silo, Arlo's mud footprint stands right beside Poppa's. Arlo had done something big for something bigger than himself, and he was home."
Spy,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3079380/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent diabolical global disaster. Susan Cooper is an unassuming, deskbound CIA analyst--and the unsung hero behind the Agency's most dangerous missions. But when her partner falls off the grid and another top agent is compromised, she volunteers to go deep undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer and prevent a global crisis.—20th Century Fox Susan Cooper is a 40-year-old, single, desk-bound CIA employee who remotely assists her partner, field agent Bradley Fine, on a mission. Fine accidentally kills arms dealer Tihomir Boyanov as he sneezes during a confrontation before extracting the location of a suitcase nuke from him. Susan uncovers evidence that Boyanov's daughter Rayna has contacted Sergio De Luca, a suspected broker with ties to various terrorist groups, so Fine infiltrates her home. However, Rayna shoots Fine dead while Susan watches helplessly online, then reveals that she knows the identities of the agency's top agents, including Rick Ford and Karen Walker. Susan, who is almost certainly unknown to Rayna, volunteers to track her (she was a top trainee agent, albeit over 10 years ago). When her boss, Elaine Crocker, reluctantly agrees, the ultra-macho Ford quits in disgust. With her best friend Nancy providing intelligence, Susan goes to Paris undercover. That night, Ford shows up and tells Susan she will fail because of her inexperience. The next morning, Susan discovers that De Luca's office has burned down. She finds a photo of a man standing next to the fire. Ford appears, argues with Susan again and leaves. Susan sees the man in the photo follow him and switch his backpack with another one containing a bomb while Ford is distracted. Susan warns Ford in time during a Verka Serduchka concert, then pursues the man into an abandoned building. During the ensuing fight, he falls to his death. When she checks the man's video camera, Susan learns that De Luca is going to Rome. Who would have thought that the inconspicuous and desk-bound CIA analyst Susan Cooper could be the guardian angel of the bureau's ultra-suave field agent, Bradley Fine? However, when things go awry in Bradley's last mission, it's Susan's turn to go undercover and retrieve information on the Bulgarian arms dealer, Rayna Boyanov, who is bent on starting a nuclear crisis of global proportions. Now, like a fish out of water, Susan must venture into the dangerous world of international espionage, and beat Rayna at her own game. Can the organisation's newest spy manage to save the day?—Nick Riganas The film begins with Bradley Fine (Jude Law) infiltrating a black-tie party, with the guidance of Susan Cooper (Melissa McCarthy). He quickly makes it to the head honcho underground (Raad Rawi) and holds him at gun-point, who reveals himself as Tihomir Boyanov, the father of Rayna Boyanov (Rose Byrne). He is about to sell a nuclear bomb to terrorists. Suddenly Fine's allergies act up and he sneezes as he shoots Boyanov's father in the head. Susan is shocked, but she quickly leads him out as Fine escapes on a boat back to the CIA. It is EXTREMELY OBVIOUS that she has a thing for him.Later, at dinner with Fine, Cooper receives a black box from Fine. She thinks it's a ring only to be shocked as it turns out to be a cupcake necklace. Fine then tells her to look at him closer.... only to find out that she contacted Pink-Eye.The next day, at CIA Headquarters, Head Elaine Crocker (Allison Janney) briefs the agents on the mission at hand. Nobody knows where the nuclear bomb is except Rayna Boyanov. She then sends off Fine to Boyanov's residence as Cooper is insulted and sent out by Agent Rick Ford (Jason Statham).That night, before the mission, Cooper goes out with her best friend Nancy (Miranda Hart) to a bar. She says that she has no idea where she's going in life. She joined the CIA after she quit being a teacher and her husband left her, and she thought things would be better, but she's just the same old boring person she was. Nancy tries to cheer her up by insulting Agent Karen Walker (Morena Baccarin), but this backfires when Walker notices them.During the mission, Fine's cameras and tech are acting up at Boyanov's residence. Cooper tells him to back-off, but he goes inside and disarms both guards. Boyanov then suddenly appears and holds him at gun-point. To Cooper's horror, Boyanov shoots Fine in the head and exposes all the agents in the CIA.The funeral for Fine happens, and Crocker decides to carry on the mission despite losing Fine. After confronting Cooper on calling Boyanov a ""thundercunt"" in the official report, Cooper discovers a list of numbers from Fine's spy-feed before he got killed. The numbers link them to De Luca (Bobby Cannavale), a businessman long suspected to be linked to terrorists; and who has an office in Paris. Crocker has no idea who to send (as all the agents' covers were blown), until Cooper volunteers, to the chagrin of Ford. After Crocker announces Cooper as officially on the case, Ford quits. Crocker then calls Cooper in her office and shows her a video from Cooper's training days. Cooper was the top of her class and was considerably aggressive, but placed herself in the job of analyst to the advice of Fine instead of being an agent.Crocker then gives Cooper her first identity and sends her off to gather her gadgets and head to France.Upon touching down in Paris, Cooper is brought, not to a grand hotel, but to a seedy motel. In her room, she is surprised by Ford, who has ""gone rogue"". After telling her a variety of (exaggerated) stories about his exploits, he tells Cooper to stay out of his way and that she will fail.The next day, Cooper finds out that the office of De Luca was burned down; he knew the CIA was coming. She then spots one of his associates on a photo taken by a bystander, and goes to a cafe where she is startled by Ford; who once again chastises her and walks away. Suddenly, De Luca's henchman appears and follows Ford. Cooper then follows them as an unidentified woman (Alicia Vela-Bailey) swaps Ford's backpack with an identical one containing a bomb. Cooper then chases and warns Ford in time for him to throw the bomb into the river without any casualties, but one of De Luca's goons snaps a picture of Cooper - blowing her cover. Cooper chases him to the burned down office and loses him - until he appears behind her and threatens her with a knife. She then takes out her gun and threatens him, at which he laughs - there's no clip - or rather it is lying on the ground beside her!. Cooper, however, successfully fends him off and knocks him off a balcony whereby he is impaled on a stake. A shaken Cooper then faints.Back in her motel room, Cooper, who took the camera, sends the footage to CIA. They then hear De Luca talking about ""Renaldo"". They figure out that ""Renaldo"" is the name of a Rolls-Royce car, and that it is presently in Rome. Cooper is then given another identity and flown off to Italy.In Rome, a spy (Peter Serafinowicz) is sent to drive Cooper to intercept ""Renaldo"". Cooper then spots De Luca going inside the Casino. To go in, she buys herself a nice dress and makes herself up.Inside the casino, Ford once again spots Cooper and insults her, while Cooper tells him to fuck off and that she's got this. Cooper then enters the private casino, and upon getting kicked out, she spots a waiter slip poison in a drink and alerts the customer- who is Reyna Boyanov in the flesh. For her thanks, Reyna forces the waiter to drink the spiked drink- which burns a hole through his throat as Cooper faints in horror. Boyanov then takes Cooper out to dinner as thanks for saving her life.During dinner, Boyanov spots Ford, sends her men to kill him; but Cooper sends out a morse code message to cut the power of the casino. While the power is out, she creates a diversion to let Ford go. Upon waking, Rayna brings ""Penny Morgan"" to her private plane en-route to Bulgaria, where Cooper is poisoned with her drink and knocked out.Upon waking, Boyanov is confronted by the Pilot (Matt DeVere) at gun-point. Cooper quickly subdues him and the other hostiles, while getting the plane under control on auto-pilot. Boyanov then holds Cooper at gunpoint, saying she knows she is from the CIA. Cooper then lies and makes up a fake name, saying that she's a bodyguard to protect her, and that her father sent her. Boyanov believes her and lets Cooper fly them into Bulgaria.In Budapest, Boyanov's associate, Anton (Björn Gustafsson), meets up with her while Cooper, mistakenly believing him to be an assassin, throws her phone at his head and insults him all the way to Boyanov's room at the hotel. Upon being left alone, she turns on her earpiece and makes her way out of the hotel, where Nancy surprises her- she was sent to keep an eye on Cooper. Boyanov then spots them and after Cooper saying that Nancy is an assistant bodyguard, an unknown assailant shoots at them, killing Boyanov's associate. Cooper picks up a pizza delivery scooter and gives chase while Nancy runs with Boyanov. Upon catching up, Cooper is surprised to see that the assailant is none other than Agent Karen Walker (Morena Baccarin). Walker is then suddenly shot in the head by a sniper while Cooper flees.Back at the hotel, Boyanov screams at her two incompetent ""bodyguards"", and tells them that her client is meeting her that night at a party, and ""don't fuck up if you don't want me to shoot a bullet in your heads"". They then hire an ""additional bodyguard"" who is none other than the spy from Rome. At the party, Cooper spots Ford yet again, as well as the woman from Paris. She then follows her as Nancy attacks musical guest star 50 Cent (playing himself) on stage to get arrested and cause a distraction. Cooper follows the woman to a restaurant, where they fight, with Cooper overpowering her and accidentally launching a knife through her hand. As she arrests her under the FBI, someone launches a knife in her heart- Fine (Jude Law), who faked his death and is now with Boyanov.Cooper is tied up and locked up with the spy from Italy. Fine then comes in and tells Cooper that his entire plan was to get close with Boyanov by faking his death, and that he was actually going to stop her. He tells Cooper to hang tight as he leaves, but Cooper has had enough. She gets help and frees herself and the spy from Italy as she drives to the estate of De Luca.De Luca, who doesn't trust Fine, tells Boyanov that the deal is off unless Fine gets killed. Cooper then pops in and gives De Luca a deal- she'll allow the deal to happen if Fine lives. She then confesses about how shitty the CIA was and how she knew that Fine would never be hers. De Luca accepts Cooper's deal.De Luca's customer then arrives and gives him his payment- millions of euros worth of diamonds. Boyanov then leads everyone to where the nuke is - inside ""Renaldo"" (the Rolls) the whole time. De Luca then suddenly shoots his customer and holds everyone at gunpoint. Ford once again interferes but accidentally knocks himself out.De Luca runs while Cooper shoots and kills every one of his henchmen, with Fine getting shot in the process. Cooper then gives chase to De Luca escaping in his helicopter, with an awakened Ford chasing after them. Cooper catches on his helicopter while Ford grabs her boobs. De Luca tries to shake them off, but only succeeds in dropping Ford and Cooper's shoes. Cooper then swings herself inside the helicopter and throws the diamonds and the nuke in the lake below. An angered De Luca then attempts to kill Cooper, but Nancy, who is now in a helicopter with the help of 50 Cent, shoots him with a sniper rifle and kills him. Cooper then lands the chopper - her first ever mission is complete.Upon landing, Ford congratulates her and drives ""off to sea"" (which is now a nuke-contaminated lake), the spy from Italy is actually MI6 (and British!) and Fine asks Cooper out on a date. She declines to have a girls night with Nancy, and the two walk away as Cooper gets a new assignment.Shortly before the credits roll, we see Cooper waking up in bed with Ford. She screams in disgust as Ford cuddles her and says, ""I know you liked it""."
Trainwreck,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3152624/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy. Despite having a love/hate relationship with her scoundrel of a father Gordon Townsend, the one thing Amy Townsend has grown up believing from him is that monogamy isn't realistic, he and Amy's mom who broke up due to infidelity when Amy was young. As such, she gets drunk and stoned frequently in her pursuit of indiscriminate sex, with an unstated rule that there is no sleeping over once the sex is over. Her current ""boyfriend"", Steven, believes they are exclusive, not knowing that she sleeps with other men. Working at sensationalistic magazine S'nuff under head sensationalist Dianna, Amy is in line for a promotion, she certain to get it if her next story meets Dianna's scrutiny. That story is a profile of sports doctor to the stars, Dr. Aaron Conners, it despite Amy knowing nothing about sports. To Amy's amazement, Aaron wants to date her following their first sexual encounter, his sexual history in terms of quantity which is in extreme contrast to her own. Also to her amazement, she kind of wants to date him, the entire ritual of being the one person in another person's life a foreign concept to her. The road to a happy ending for the two is not guaranteed as their very different sexual histories and very different perspectives on sexual life may make them incompatible despite truly liking each other as people. Ensuring that his man Aaron is happy and doesn't get hurt in the process is someone who seems to take Aaron's personal life even more to heart than he does:LeBron James.—Huggo Amy's parents divorced when she was still a child. Her father didn't believe in monogamy, and this left an impression on Amy. 23 years later she lives by her father's model, sleeping around and not believing in long-term relationships. Then she falls for a sports doctor, Aaron, and everything changes.—grantss A raunchy yet heartfelt comedy from director Judd Apatow about Amy (Amy Schumer), a commitment-phobic binge drinker living in New York City, who must reevaluate her feelings about intimate relationships when a sports doctor pursues a romance with her.. Since she was a little girl, it's been drilled into Amy's head by her rascal of a dad that monogamy isn't realistic. Now a magazine writer, Amy lives by that credo - enjoying what she feels is an uninhibited life free from stifling, boring romantic commitment - but in actuality, she's kind of in a rut. When she finds herself starting to fall for the subject of the new article she's writing, a charming and successful sports doctor named Aaron Conners, Amy starts to wonder if other grown-ups, including this guy who really seems to like her, might be on to something.—Universal Pictures In the opening scene, Gordon (Colin Quinn) tells his two daughters, Amy and Kim, that he and their mother are divorcing because monogamy isn't realistic.In the present day, the adult Amy (Amy Schumer) is hooking up with a random guy. She asks him to go down on her, which he does - and after which Amy immediately pretends to fall asleep. We see a montage of her life - getting drunk, getting stoned, partying, and with lots of guys - even though she's sort of already dating Steven (John Cena). She wakes up one morning in Staten Island and has to take the ferry back to New York in full ""walk of shame"" mode.Amy gets back to her life - she works at S'nuff, a snarky men's magazine. After telling her co-worker Nikki (Vanessa Bayer) about last night, she goes into a work meeting where her boss Dianna (Tilda Swinton) asks for pitches for new articles. One of her co-workers pitches an article about a sports doctor, Aaron Conners (Bill Hader). Amy makes fun of the idea, saying sports are stupid, and she thinks anyone who cares about them is a lesser person. Dianna thinks that Amy's take on the article will be the most interesting and assigns the article to her, despite the fact that she doesn't even want it.Amy goes to her father's house to help her sister Kim (Brie Larson) pack the place up. Apparently, Gordon has multiple sclerosis and has just been moved into an assisted living home. Kim is married to Tom (Mike Birbiglia) and has a stepson, the dorky Allister, who annoys Amy like crazy (she's not good with kids). Kim resents their dad because he slept around, was a drunk, and wasn't a good father... plus he cheated on their mom for no clear reason. She thinks they can't afford the nice assisted living place they've put him in, but Amy wants to make it work. Amy later visits Gordon in the home, and he's upset when she tells him Kim threw away a lot of his Mets memorabilia. He's a total curmudgeon.Amy goes to meet Aaron to set up their interview schedules and meets his best friend, LeBron James. LeBron is insistent on watching Downton Abbey and also getting his parking validated. That night, Amy goes on a date with Steven. He's upset that she's drunk, and their loud conversation gets him into a fight with the other moviegoers. Amy goes outside to smoke a joint, and when she comes back, Steven asks her who all the guys on her phone are. They go outside where Amy admits she sleeps with other guys. Steven is hurt, since he thought they were exclusive. He wants to have a family with her and make her his ""CrossFit queen"". All Amy can say is that she's too stoned and asks if she can leave. Steven tells her she's not a nice person and leaves, crushed.The next morning, Amy gets brunch with Kim, and after Kim doesn't have a mimosa, she realizes she's pregnant. They go to Gordon to tell him, and he's thrilled to have finally a grandchild - which makes Kim angry, since she says Allister is his grandchild. Gordon says Allister isn't really his grandchild, and after he and Amy make fun of the kid together, Kim leaves, furious. She says Amy always takes Gordon's side.Amy is interviewing Aaron at his sports facility. She's testing out a treadmill body-imaging suit, running when she gets a text from Kim saying she wants to move Gordon to a cheaper facility. Amy asks to slow down the treadmill and starts to have a full panic attack. Aaron coaches her breathing and calms her down, and suggests they get food. They bond over dinner - he compliments her writing, she learns about his family. And after some drinks they get in a cab to leave. Aaron tells the driver two stops, but Amy corrects him: one stop. Aaron's eyes widen. They go to his place and sleep together, and Amy breaks her rule by staying the night.The next day, Amy tells Nikki about what happened, and Aaron calls to ask if they can see each other again. Amy panics and tells him they'll talk about it at the interview. She and Nikki decide she has to end it. Meanwhile, LeBron is excited for Aaron; he hasn't dated anyone in six years. Amy goes to watch Aaron perform surgery (she pukes while watching) to Uptown Girl, his favorite song, and afterwards tries to politely break things off, but he won't let her. He thinks they like each other and should date (she's dumbfounded) and then Amy gets a phone call that her dad had a fall. Aaron drives her to the home where Aaron stitches up her dad's cut and impresses him with his sports knowledge.Aaron and Amy begin dating and fall for each other. Both of them are nervous. Amy is worried she's going to screw it up, but Kim tells her she's just finally doing what everyone else does. LeBron coaches Aaron over basketball. He wipes the floor with Aaron until Aaron scores a lucky shot. Amy goes with Aaron to a charity slam dunk contest LeBron is hosting. There are guys doing crazy trampoline dunks, and the Knick City Dancers perform. Amy makes fun of them for being like strippers. LeBron confronts Amy and asks her what her intentions are with Aaron. Confused, she assures him they're fine. Later, Amy goes to see Gordon, and hedisapproves of her relationship with Aaron. She's upset, wondering why he can't support her, and he says he knows she's just like him. She can't have a stable relationship. Amy leaves angry, not talking to her dad for a while.Aaron goes with Amy to Kim's baby shower. Tom makes a comment to Aaron about how Amy sleeps around that unnerves him. Meanwhile, Amy can't stand the ridiculous hoighty-toighty women at the shower and deliberately grosses them out with tales of her sexcapades. A couple days later, Kim calls her - Amy starts to apologize for the shower when Kim tells her Gordon has died. He was hoarding his meds. At the funeral, Amy gives a speech (she knows Gordon offended everyone). She says: ""raise your hand if my dad ever offended you"", but then says she loved him more than anything; ""raise your hand if he was also one of your favorite people"". After the funeral, she and Kim get into a big fight, Amy says Kim didn't even like Gordon anyway. Aaron tells her he loves her, but Amy can't believe he would pick today of all days to say that. Meanwhile, at work, Dianna tells Amy they're cutting the Aaron story because it was boring.Aaron is receiving a prestigious award at a Luncheon and brings Amy. She drinks too much and leaves to take a phone call from Dianna during his speech. He finds her smoking pot outside and is upset. They continue arguing at her apartment, and Aaron thinks they shouldn't go to bed angry - so Amy lets him have it, keeping him awake all night ranting and raving even though the next day is Aaron's big surgery on Amar'e Stoudemire. Aaron shows up completely out of it, and Amar'e panics and cancels the surgery. Aaron goes home and tells Amy that they need to take a break. Hurt, Amy reacts by telling him that they can just break up because the article was canceled anyway. He tells her ""you win"", and leaves.Amy returns to her ""trainwreck"" ways and goes out drinking at a bar with her co-workers, including the intern Donald (Ezra Miller). He invites her back to his place, and their bizarre sexual encounter is interrupted when his mom enters, screaming ""he's 16!"" After nearly committing statutory rape, Dianna fires Amy, but does tell her she was wrong about the article and thinks it's quite good.Aaron is moping all day in his apartment until LeBron calls telling him he's been hurt. Aaron rushes over to find an intervention for him consisting of LeBron, Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and Marv Albert. They tell him he's always been afraid of opening up and needs to make things right with Amy, but Aaron insists Amy and he are over.Amy goes to Kim to mend fences after their fight. After she tells Kim everything that's happened, Kim tells her maybe it's time to change. Amy clears out all the booze from her apartment and goes and pitches her Aaron story at Vanity Fair, who end up publishing it. She sends the article to Aaron and he smiles. He successfully performs the surgery on Amar'e and attends Amar'e's first game post-op. After the game, Aaron is called to the court - where the Knicks City dancers perform with Amy front and center. She hilariously knows about 80 percent of the moves and can't quite do them exactly the same as the dancers. Included in the songs is ""Uptown Girl"". For the grand finale, the slam dunk guys come back, and Amy races and jumps off the trampoline to make a dunk... and immediately face plants. Aaron rushes over to see if she's okay, and she tells him she was trying to show him that she can work hard and try, and she wants to make it work. She finally tells him she loves him, and they kiss, which is shown all over the jumbotron."

Rocky coming out of boxing retirement raises some questions as to why and the eventual discovery of Donny's Creed heritage. While the Creed-Balboa combination in name alone can open doors, both Donny and Rocky have to decide if using the Creed name is the right move specifically for Donny, especially with others who may have ulterior motives not in Donny's best interest. Regardless of what they decide to do, they will spiritually have others in their corner: Mary Anne, who despite not liking Donny's career path, still wants to see her adoptive son thrive and succeed in whatever he does; Donny's girlfriend, Bianca, who is nonetheless facing her own issues as an aspiring singer who has progressive hearing loss; and Apollo, who lives in both Donny himself and Rocky. Through it all, other real life issues taking place outside the ring may factor into what happens to Donny.—Huggo In the opening scene, set at a juvenile correctional facility in Los Angeles in the year 1998, a fight breaks out between Adonis ""Donnie"" Johnson (Alex Henderson) and another boy after the boy says something about Donnie's late mother. After being pulled away and placed in his cell, Donnie is visited by Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad). Thinking she is another social worker there to put him in another group home, Donnie refuses to talk to her until she says that his father was her husband, and she would like him to come live with her. Donnie asks her what his father's name was.In the present day, in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, Donnie (now played by Michael B. Jordan) is competing in a boxing match. He defeats his opponent easily and collects his earnings. 12 hours later, he returns to Los Angeles where he works a desk job. Unsatisfied, he hands in his letter of resignation to his boss and chooses to move on.Donnie goes to the Delphi Gym where his father, the late Apollo Creed, used to train. Donnie challenges all the fighters in the gym to a match, and the winner gets the keys to his Mustang. One fighter steps up, but Donnie knocks him down easily. Another professional fighter, Danny ""Stuntman"" Wheeler (Andre Ward), takes on Donnie and defeats him, taking the keys. Donnie goes to Mary Anne's home and she sees his bloodshot eye. She hates that he is fighting like Apollo was, reminding him what he went through during his days as a fighter. Later, Donnie watches an old fight between his father and Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), and Donnie mimes his father's fighting style.Donnie moves to Philadelphia to start anew. In his new apartment, he watches a news segment on undefeated boxing champion ""Pretty"" Ricky Conlan (Tony Bellew), who is set to compete in what may be his last professional match as he is being charged with gun possession and may spend the next seven years behind bars. Conlan was set to fight Wheeler, but they started fighting early and Conlan broke Wheeler's jaw, prompting Wheeler to file a lawsuit against him. As Donnie tries to sleep, he hears loud music coming from the apartment below him. He goes knocking and meets his neighbor Bianca (Tessa Thompson). He demands she turn the music down, and she says she will, only to keep it at the same volume.Donnie goes to Adrian's Restaurant, owned and managed by Rocky. There, Donnie sees a picture of Rocky and Apollo fighting (from their first match in 1976). Rocky comes out and meets Donnie for the first time. He asks Rocky to train him, but Rocky claims to be done with that. Donnie also asks about a third fight that the two had behind closed doors (at the end of Rocky III) and inquires as to who won. Rocky says Apollo did.Donnie goes to another gym operated by Pete Sporino (Ritchie Coster). When he says he comes from L.A., Donnie earns the nickname ""Hollywood"". He chooses to continue seeking Rocky's help, while also deciding to pursue a relationship with Bianca after hearing her perform at a night club. The two go and get Philly cheese steaks, and Donnie learns that Bianca has progressive hearing loss, so she is preparing for the inevitable.Rocky visits the cemetery and sits by the graves of his brother-in-law Paulie and Adrian. It's Paulie's birthday, and Rocky wants to remember his departed friend.Rocky decides to take Donnie under his wing, and Donnie starts calling him ""Unc"" (uncle). Donnie stays at Rocky's place as they train bright and early, while also developing a close bond.Donnie's first major fight is against Pete's son Leo (Gabe Rosado). Before the match, Pete approaches Rocky and says that he knows Donnie is Apollo Creed's son. Thinking this could bring in good press, Pete wants to exploit the name, but Rocky prefers to keep it a secret. The match commences, and although Donnie takes a few hits, he defeats Leo.Word breaks out that Donnie is Apollo's son, conceived out of an affair during Apollo's marriage. Commentators begin to look at Donnie differently, as he feared, while also wondering if this discovery will hurt Apollo's legacy. In Liverpool, Conlan's manager Tommy Holiday (Graham McTavish) learns of this and thinks this could make for an eventful fight. He flies to the States to meet with Rocky and Donnie to propose the fight to them. After much deliberation, Rocky and Donnie agree to go on with the fight.Rocky starts to put Donnie through more training, but he then vomits and collapses. Donnie takes Rocky to the hospital for a test. Later on, Rocky meets with the doctor and learns he has been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. The doctor says it's good that they caught it early and that they ought to start chemotherapy soon, but Rocky refuses to go through with that because it didn't work out for Adrian when the same thing happened. Donnie eventually finds out on his own and is upset with Rocky for not wanting to get help, but Rocky wants to just accept his fate.With the news of his name being outed to the world, Donnie begins to fear that he will be looked at as a fake Creed and a failure to his father's legacy. He visits Bianca at the club where she performs and meets Tone Trump (Anthony Brice). Tone takes a picture with Donnie, but he upsets Donnie when he refers to him as ""Baby Creed"". This escalates into a fight, and Donnie is arrested, with Rocky coming to bail him out. Donnie later goes to Bianca's apartment to apologize and admit that he is scared for himself and for Rocky's sake. Bianca tells him they need to work on their own issues separately and she shuts him out.Donnie and Rocky reach a compromise, wherein Rocky continues to train Donnie for the upcoming fight, and Rocky will undergo chemotherapy. After much extensive training, Donnie earns supporters around town, particularly from the youths in the area.The two fly to Liverpool for a press conference. Conlan shows up with Holiday and starts trash-talking Donnie, saying he is an overnight success and a false Creed. Rocky holds Donnie back from making a dumb move, saying this is what Conlan wants.The night of the big fight arrives, and even Bianca is there to show support. Mary Anne watches from her home. As a gift, she sent Donnie his father's original American flag shorts. The fans boo and jeer Donnie as he makes his way to the ring, while Conlan gets a dramatic entrance and all the fans chant his name. As the fight commences, Conlan cuts Donnie above the eye and wins the first round. However, Donnie steps up and starts to get some hits in, but not enough to convince everyone else that he's worthy. Between rounds, Rocky and Holiday offer encouragement and support to their respective fighters. Donnie takes many hits and spits out a lot of blood, and eventually Conlan hits his left eye so hard that it gets completely shut, but since Donnie can still see well enough, the fight continues. Conlan strikes Donnie again, knocking him to the ground. Donnie then remembers what he's fighting for, and he gets up real fast. Donnie strikes back and hits Conlan multiple times before bringing him to the floor, but Conlan gets up before the referee gets to 10. The fight is over, and Conlan remains undefeated. However, he acknowledges Donnie's work with respect, and Donnie reciprocates. The commentator approaches Donnie and briefly interviews him. Donnie refers to Rocky as his family. The commentator asks Donnie what he would say to his father if he were there. Donnie says he would tell Apollo that he loves him and that he knows he didn't leave him on purpose. The fans then start to chant ""Creed"". Donnie leaves with Rocky and Bianca.In the final scene, back in Philadelphia, Rocky and Donnie climb the famed steps in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Rocky is a bit winded to keep going, but Donnie pushes him to keep walking up. As they get to the top, they admire the view of the city."

Bound by a shared destiny, a bright, optimistic teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor jaded by disillusionment embark on a danger-filled mission to unearth the secrets of an enigmatic place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory as ""Tomorrowland.""—Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures In order to save our world from danger, a curious teenage girl with a high interest in science, and a former genius inventor embark on an adventure packed journey filled with evil machines, robots and, a technology paradise known as, ""Tomorrowland""! Casey Newton is a genius who dreams of one day going up into space. She's sure she'll get her chance because her father works at the NASA launch center at Cape Canaveral. But when the place is being closed down, Casey sneaks in and tries to stop them from doing that by sabotaging the equipment. She is caught and thrown in jail, when she's released and her personal effects are given to her, among them is a pin which she says is not hers. When she touches it, she finds in a futuristic city. When the pin runs out of energy, she wants to go back so she finds online someone who might know something about it. She goes there and when she talks to the people there, they ask her who gave it to her. When she says she doesn't know, they don't believe her and refuse to let her leave. Eventually they reveal themselves to be armed with advanced weapons. They try to shoot her but someone saves her and she discovers the ones who attacked her are robots. The one who saved her introduces herself as Athena. She says that Casey needs to help save the future. She takes Casey to meet a man named Frank Walker. When she sees him, he refuses to help. But when they are attacked by more robots, they try to go to the place she saw.—rcs0411@yahoo.com When a scientifically minded teenager (Britt Robertson) discovers a technologically advanced trinket that provides an astounding glimpse of the future, she enlists the help of a reclusive inventor (George Clooney) to make ""Tomorrowland"" a reality today.. Frank Walker (George Clooney) is talking to an unseen audience about the future when a female voice interrupts him, tell him that his wording is a touch 'bleak.' When the female asks him to think back to when he thought of the future as an optimistic place, he talks about when he went to the 1964 World's Fair in New York City as a child.Young Frank (Thomas Robinson) eagerly enters the Hall of Inventions carrying a very large duffle bag containing his invention: a jet pack he made. Though the judge David Nix (Hugh Laurie) does not show much enthusiasm for the device (which Frank admits doesn't work properly), a little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) seems to think Frank's invention has potential.Outside the hall, Athena catches up with Frank. Giving him a small pin, she requests that he follow her behind a small group. The group also includes Mr Nix, and some guests of his.Putting on the pin, Frank follows the group to the ""It's a Small World"" attraction, where Frank bypasses the line and boards one of the boats by himself. During the ride, a laser scans his pin, and he's suddenly plunged down a secret chute, underneath the ride. The boat Frank is on then pulls up at a small transport station.After a disorienting ride, Frank finds himself on a foggy platform, but sees a strange flying vehicle taking off nearby, with Athena waving to him. Frank attempts to follow, but finds himself on the edge of a platform. Suddenly, construction robots arise, creating new structures, but knocking Frank down to a lower level. As his jetpack clatters to the platform, a robot nearby suddenly grabs it. Frank fights to get back his invention, but he is surprised when the huge automaton fixes it. However, Frank inadvertently falls from this platform as well, but upon igniting his jetpack, he finds himself soaring amid a gleaming white cityscape unlike anything he's ever seen before. Eventually, he sees Athena and the others, and touches down right in front of Mr Nix...who only seems mildly amused that Frank's invention can actually fly. Even so, Athena gives the young boy a reaffirming smile.Frank then becomes pessimistic again, when the female voice interrupts that he's seeming negative again. When Frank asks if the unnamed voice would like to take over telling the story, it obliges. We are then introduced to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), who happily proclaims she's 'an optimist.'After a brief glimpse of a young Casey naming stars in the night sky, we cut to the modern day. Late one evening, Casey surreptitiously enters a Cape Canaveral, Florida NASA launch pad that is being demolished. She sabotages three construction cranes. When she returns home, her dad tells her 'the end' of the space shuttle's former launch site is inevitable. Casey still feels she's contributing something with trying to slow down the deconstruction.Unseen by Casey, a dark figure trails her from the NASA site to her home, and quietly slips a small pin into her helmet, dangling from her motorcycle handlebar.The next day, her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) laments how even though he's a NASA engineer, there's very little hope for him to do anything useful. Ever the Optimist, Casey reminds him of the metaphor of two wolves: light and hope, darkness and despair. In the end, as Eddie told Casey, the one who will win, is the one you feed.Casey goes to school, but becomes a bother in all her classes. Her teachers tell of nuclear annihilation, planetary meltdown, and governmental collapse, but Casey just wants to know one thing: ""how can we fix it?"" However, this question receives no answers.After hearing word that NASA has brought in working equipment from Orlando to continue disassembling the platform, Casey goes out to stop them, but is caught by NASA security.After her father bails her out of jail, Casey collects her things, but is surprised to find a small pin with the letter ""T"" on it. Picking it up, she is surprised when it seems to transport her to an endless field of wheat, with a futuristic city off in the distance.On the ride home, Casey attempts to show the pin to her father, but when Eddie touches it, nothing happens.Later on that evening, Casey sneaks out of the house, and bicycles to a large field. Touching the pin this time, she finds herself in the center of a dazzling futuristic city, with jetpacks and hovertrains. She also becomes enamored seeing a rocket launch station, and follows a group of space travelers...before the pin suddenly runs out of power, and she finds herself having wandered waist-deep into a lake.Waking up her little brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), she asks him for help trying to find another pin on the Internet. Their search takes them to a website of Blast From The Past, a store in Houston, Texas. Strangely, they only have a street address, but don't list an email or phone number.Casey tells Nate to cover for her while she takes a bus to Houston to talk to the store owners. The next day, Athena sees Nate in front of their home who asks to see Casey. When Nate attempts to tell Athena that Casey is away, she claims he's lying, and asks where she ""really"" is.Arriving at Blast From The Past, Casey meets the store owners, Ursula (Kathryn Hahn), and Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key). They tell her that the pin supposedly was a key to showing a world created by some of the greatests geniuses in history, who called themselves Plus Ultra.When the two press Casey for more information on where she got the pin, her claims that she just 'found it' cause the two to get upset. Things take a turn for the strange when the two grab two actual-working laser guns, and attempt to kill her.Casey is saved when Athena appears, stopping the two in their tracks with a time-bomb (a device that stops time temporarily in a 15 foot radius). As the two get free, Casey and Athena fight them, with Athena pulling off Ursula's head, and Hugo being skewered. Both Casey and Athena rush out of the store before Hugo self-destructs, with the small girl then breaking into a car, and allowing the two of them to get away.In the car, Athena tells Casey that the two people they encountered, were Audio-Animatronic figures, and it was she (Athena) who gave Casey the pin. However, the fight has damaged Athena, and Casey panics when she realizes that the little girl is also a robot!Casey attempts to flee with Athena giving chase...but not before a truck slams into the small robot; Casey uses the opportunity to take the truck, but Athena quickly recovers, and chases after Casey, managing to catch up to her' Athena claims she is from the place Casey saw when she touched the pin (which happened to be her last one.), but it may not be there much longer.After a small discussion, Casey is willing to accept that Athena will not harm her. Athena wishes them to drive to Pittsfield, New York, to meet a man named Frank Walker.Back in Houston, Police are combing through the wreckage of the store, when a black van pulls up, and several people get out, led by a smiling man who calls himself Dave Clark (Matthew MacCaull). When one of the officers finds the charred remains of Ursula's head, Dave pulls out a device that disintegrates the nearby officers. Once they are done away with, he informs the other members of his party to contact Governor Nix.Eventually, driving all-night wears Casey out, and she relinquishes the driving duties to Athena...only to awaken on the side of a road, with Athena driving away!Seeing a mailbox nearby with the name ""Walker"" on it, she ignores the no trespassing sign and comes onto the property. She soon encounters a barking dog, but upon seeing it leaving no paw prints in the dirt, finds that it is simply a realistic hologram.Going to the front door, a man on the other side tells Casey to leave. When she demands to be taken to the place the pin showed, a concussive blast sends her flying backward, and Frank emerges.While she pleads to be taken to the place she saw, Frank tells her it doesn't actually exist. What she saw was a 'commercial' for this place, and they threw him out, and sealed off all ways to get back in.Frank once again tells Casey to leave, but she refuses to. As day turns to night, Casey notices a number of cables leading from the main house, and finds they are all attached to an array of antennas and satellite dishes.Setting a nearby tractor on fire, Casey gets Frank to leave the house, and get inside. Frank manages to put out the fire, but Casey refuses to let him back in until he takes her where she wants to go.Exploring the house, she finds some futuristic-looking devices, and a room showing numerous world and political turmoil, along with a countdown clock, and a 'probability' detector.Frank manages to get back in the house, and attempts to get Casey to leave once again, but she demands to know what she has just been witness to. When Frank realizes she won't just leave, he posits a question: ""What if I could tell you the exact day you would die?""Casey claims she'd naturally want to know, but then if she did find out, she wouldn't believe it, and would try to find some way to change the future. Suddenly, the monitors behind her all flicker, and the probability numbers drop by the smallest percentage...but it's still enough to make Frank take notice.Suddenly, sensors indicate intruders, and a black van with dark-suited figures is seen. Frank attempts to fortify his house, but the intruders break in, revealing they are audio-animatronic figures. Frank manages to grab some things and stuff them in a bag, before he and Casey get into a bathtub, which rockets them out of the house as the former inventor self-destructs his birthplace.The tub lands in a nearby pond, and Casey and Frank emerge to find Athena in a truck nearby. The group begins to drive away from the house, but Frank quickly gets into a small argument with Athena.Athena ends up taking them to a television station, hoping Frank can take them to ""The Spectacle."" Frank at first refuses, but finally relents, willing to accompany them.Leading them into a utility shack, he reveals a secret underground entrance, wherein lies a teleportation machine. As he covers Casey's eyes and ears as part of the teleportation procedure, Frank asks why Athena chose someone like Casey.""Because she hasn't given up,"" the small automaton replies.In a matter of moments, the three are transported to their new location: atop the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France.After subduing a guard, the group find their way into a small room, wherein are figures of Thomas Edison, Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, and Nicola Tesla. Frank claims that the Eiffel tower functions as an antenna, and a secret gateway the men made, as an emergency entrance to reach their secret city. Frank reveals an Edison Tube, that when put on a phonograph, opens a secret entrance.As the group watches, the tower splits in two, becoming a gantry, and a rocketship emerges from a compartment beneath the ground. Getting into the rocket, the three find French robots also attempting to stop them. However, the rocket blasts off before they can get to the three.After breaking free of Earth's gravity, the main compartment of the rocket flips around, and hurtles back towards Earth, breaking through into another dimension.The three emerge near the rocket area that Casey saw in the commercial, only it's desolate and deserted. Seeing a group of vehicles approach, Frank hands Athena a small device: a 1-kiloton bomb the size of a small ball, that she hides in a compartment inside herself. Frank claims they may need it for leverage.As the group watches, a hover train arrives, and Governor Nix emerges, looking just as he did when Frank first met him. Nix exchanges some short 'pleasantries' with Frank and Athena, and is then introduced to Casey. It is here that Frank explains about the probability blip he saw, feeling she can change things.The group then heads to a central tower, with a giant sphere nearby, sending energy into it. A platform transports the group up, with tachyons bathing the group, showing glimpses of things several moments in the future.As the platform rises into the sphere, a globe rises up on a pedestal in the center of the room. Frank shows Casey that it can take people in and out of places, and go backwards and forwards in time, showing people the Earth. Casey tests it out, and Nix is surprised how quickly she adapts to using it.Zeroing in on the NASA landing platform, Casey pushes into the future, but is surprised when the image becomes fuzzy. Pushing forward, she sees fire and smoke. Going over the globe, she sees other things: cities being destroyed, tornadoes and freak thunderstorms, before seeing her family's home underwater.Frank claims that what they see is said to be coming in a month's time or less. Casey is angered as to why Nix hasn't told anyone on Earth about what will happen, but Nix shows no reason to be concerned: what will happen will happen on Earth. The city will survive. When this prompts Casey to ask why Nix doesn't allow those on Earth to come to the city, he counters that there is too great of a risk for humans to destroy it, just like the Earth.Casey then shows her optimism by refusing to give in to what the machine has shown them, when suddenly, the panoramic view brightens, and the environment looks normal. Frank eagerly tells Nix that he has witnessed what he was talking about, but the Governor taps Frank with a device, knocking him out.Frank awakens in a confined room, with Athena and Casey nearby. Athena tells Frank he is once again to be banished, with Casey upset that Frank didn't tell her about the impending end of the world. Frank tells Case that he knows she's 'special,' but her optimism seems to have dried up. Feeling lied to that the pin seemed broadcast into her mind a vision of a bright future...she suddenly comes to a startling conclusion.Frank's antennas and dishes were grabbing feeds of what the device was broadcasting. But what if it the machine isn't just predicting the future...it is causing people to give in to these visions, and just accept what will happen: a self-fulfilling prophecy doomsday device.The three are brought before Nix, who has decided to banish them to a deserted island, via a portal. Frank attempts to tell Nix about what they found out, but he claims that shutting down the sphere won't make any difference. Casey is still upset that given everything they've seen, little glimmers of hope, this futurist can't seem to see reason, before Frank explains that the sphere was Nix's idea (of which Frank helped to assemble it).Nix's idea was reasonable: broadcast a future in which humanity would be galvanized to do something about what they believed would happen...but instead, all the visions did was make people accept what they saw, and give in. They repackaged what they saw into media, and seemed to care only for the here-and-now, never willing to consider what their actions could mean for the future.The three are about to be put through the portal, when Frank activates the sphere's lift via the controls on Nix's watch. As the two struggle, Frank tells Athena to use the 1-kiloton device to blow up the sphere.However, Nix activates two robots, and Athena is detained. Tossing the device to Casey, she climbs onto the platform. She manages to arm the device, but during Frank's struggle, Nix manages to keep the platform from ascending. With the device armed, and no way up, Casey hurls the device through the portal, with Athena shutting it just before it explodes. However, the blast loosens a piece of architecture, and it crashes down on Nix's leg, pinning him to the ground.Suddenly, Athena sees Nix shoot Frank with a laser gun...only to see it was a tachyon glimpse of the future. Seeing the real thing unfold before her, she rushes into the line of fire, and takes the blast.Frank attempts to get Athena to a repair station, but she tells him she can't be repaired. As she begins to shut down, Athena reveals to Frank glimpses of her memory, via logs:one tells of how she fears what will happen when he finds out she isn't human, but wishes to support him, as it seems she helps spur on his creativity. - another tells how she may be having emotions towards him, but has decided not to report this.the final transmission, shows the year 1984, in which Frank was exiled from Tomorrowland, blaming Athena for what happened.Athena explains that she can still be of use to Frank: she has a self-destruct device within her, and she can be used to destroy the sphere. Using a jet pack, Frank ascends above the city with his former friend and confidante.As she shuts down, Frank drops her into the sphere. Her self-destruct mechanism sends the sphere crashing to the ground, and crushing Governor Nix.Once back on the ground, Casey and Frank wonder what to do next. It is soon decided there is only one thing to do: become proactive!Casey opens the portal near her home, and invites her father and brother into Tomorrowland.Frank decides to reopen the recruitment program, turning on the pin-making machines, and building a number of new child-looking recruiters.We soon find that this is who Casey and Frank have been talking to the whole time: the new recruiters (like Athena). Each one is given their own pin-case, with a mission to find Dreamers, those that will help build a newer, and better Tomorrow.The final images show a number of people finding the ""T"" pins. As they each touch them, we then see dozens of people popping up in the vast wheat field, eyes drawn towards the spires of Tomorrowland."
Get Hard,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2561572/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When millionaire James King is jailed for fraud and bound for San Quentin, he turns to Darnell Lewis to prep him to go behind bars. Kevin Hart plays the role of Darnell--a family man desperate to get enough money to buy a house in a better area to benefit his family's well-being. He is hired by James (Will Ferrell), a wimpy stock trader who is about to go to prison for 10 years, to prepare him for life behind bars. The catch is that James thinks Darnell is an ex-con--not because Darnell told him that, but because James just assumed.—The Twiz When obscenely rich hedge-fund manager James (Will Ferrell) is convicted of fraud and sentenced to a stretch in San Quentin, the judge gives him one month to get his affairs in order. Knowing that he won't survive more than a few minutes in prison on his own, James desperately turns to Darnell (Kevin Hart) - a black businessman who's never even had a parking ticket - for help. As Darnell puts James through the wringer, both learn that they were wrong about many things, including each other. The film starts with James King (Will Ferrell) crying hysterically.One month earlier.James was an extremely wealthy hedge fund manager, engaged to his gorgeous gold-digging fiancee Alissa (Alison Brie). His car washer, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) is married to Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and trying to put their daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal) in a better school away from the bad neighborhood they live in.James meets Darnell when the latter accidentally frightens James in the parking lot because he assumed Darnell was going to rob him, when he just wanted to give him his keys. James makes a speech about how he got to his success, and to inspire Darnell to go for his. He pulls out a big wad of cash, only to pull out two singles as a ""tip"" for Darnell.Alissa hosts an engagement party for herself and James. She gives him an electric guitar as a gift, and she invites John Mayer up onstage to perform. James performs alongside Mayer momentarily until the cops storm in and arrest James for fraud and embezzlement.James's lawyer Peter Penny (Greg Germann) urges James to go for a guilty plea, but he refuses and insists that he will be exonerated. Instead, everybody that lost money in the embezzlement scheme is out for James's head. The judge finds him guilty and sentences James to ten years at San Quentin, with only 30 days to get his affairs in order. His assets are frozen and he is placed under house arrest. He cuts off the ankle bracelet and tries to flee the country. He drives to a country club to get Alissa to go with him, but she says she has left him and decided to move on. The police then show up and get James. James asks his boss and Alissa's father Martin (Craig T. Nelson) for help.James encounters Darnell once more in the parking lot, expressing his fears over going to prison. He asks Darnell how he managed in prison, simply assuming he was incarcerated because he is black. An outraged Darnell reminds James that he will most likely be made somebody's bitch once he gets to prison. With that in mind, James begs Darnell to teach him how to toughen up if he wants to survive in prison. Darnell demands payment in the form of $30,000. James agrees to this.Darnell, who has little idea of how to act tough himself (he gets smacked after calling Rita a bitch), tries to put on a facade of his own to convince James that he can show him how to prepare himself. He calls up his cousin who did go to prison and asks him what went down. To start his ""training"", Darnell pepper-sprays James upon arriving at his home. He tries to get James to become intimidating with his ""mad dog"" face, but James can only ""sad dog"" it.Darnell tests James in fighting back by creating scenarios in which he must defend himself. He makes James pick fights at the park, only for James to get his ass kicked multiple times. James gets in touch with Martin and says he's getting help. Martin, who is the actual crook, thinks James is onto him and orders his lawyer and a hired gun named Gayle (Paul Ben-Victor) to take care of business.With little time left and even less improvement, Darnell figures that James has to learn how to perform oral sex in prison. They go to a gay hook-up spot for James to find a man to suck off. He can't go through with it and tells Darnell (in front of the other curious and interested gay men) that he will keep going and do whatever it takes to get hard. They leave as the men applaud them.James starts to work out harder and faster. He starts to make shivs just in case, and he keeps one in his anus just in case. Darnell simulates a prison raid with the help acting as inmates. In the chaos, James gets a shiv stuck in his head. Darnell drives James to his home for Rita to get the shiv out. He has dinner and listens to Darnell make up a story of how he went to prison (he just retells ""Boyz N The Hood""). Rita asks Darnell why he can't just find the real criminal to help James.Mere days before his incarceration, James and Darnell resolve for James to join a local gang, the Crenshaw Kings, to protect him in prison. James dresses in a ridiculous outfit that gets unwanted attention. Darnell's cousin Russell (T.I.) runs the gang and isn't convinced that James can pay him and knows that Darnell is lying about prison. James does help the gang gain interest in finance and stocks.Darnell drives James to a bar where the Allegiance of Whites gang is. James is unable to be a convincing racist, leading the white supremacists to think he's a cop. They nearly burn his face with a motorcycle tire until Darnell rescues him by bursting in with a flamethrower.Darnell realizes James is innocent and they conclude that Martin is the crook. They sneak into his home and find the embezzlement records on Martin's old computer. Unfortunately, Gayle finds them and takes the computer back after telling James that Darnell has a clean record and never actually went to prison. James feels betrayed and leaves the garage.James returns to the Crenshaw Kings with the intention of joining. For his initiation, they want him to kill someone. Darnell arrives in time to stop him and convince him to catch Martin and expose him.The two find Martin's yacht and sneak on board. They grab the computer, only to come across Gayle and more hitmen.

Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor and safeguard the future, an unexpected turn of events creates a fractured time-line. Now, Sgt. Reese finds himself in a new and unfamiliar version of the past, where he is faced with unlikely allies, including the Guardian, dangerous new enemies, and an unexpected new mission: To reset the future. John Connor, the one leading the human rebels against Skynet, has a plan to attack Skynet but decides not to take part in it and opts instead to prevent Skynet from implementing its contingency plan--to send a terminator to kill the woman who would give birth to John, Sarah Connor. But he fails so he sends his right hand, Kyle Reese who is the one who will sire him, to protect Sarah. And as Reese is leaving he sees John attacked by someone there who is one of Skynet's soldiers. When Reese arrives, he discovers a terminator which is not like the ones he's encountered. He is saved by Sarah who knows who he is and why he is there. He also discovers she has a terminator with her. She tells him that the terminator he encountered was sent to kill her when she was nine and the terminator, with her, was sent to save her and has been her companion and guardian ever since. They intercepted the terminator he followed and plan to use its chip to activate a time machine they built to go to 1997 which is when Skynet was activated, but Reese says they should not go to 1997 but to 2017. He says that there's a voice or memory that tells him to remember the date because it's when they can stop Skynet. So Sarah and Reese go, the terminator stays behind and says he'll meet them when they arrive but they get arrested when they arrive and someone unexpected show up.—rcs0411@yahoo.com It is 2029. Since 1997 humans have been engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the robots of Skynet. One of the leaders of the human forces is John Connor. He sends Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother, Sarah Connor. Upon arriving in 1984 he discovers that Sarah Connor already has a protector, a largely-obsolete robot / Terminator. However, Skynet has also sent back a Terminator.—grantss On the brink of ending the War against the Machines--more than three decades after the nuclear Armageddon inTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)--John Connor sends his right-hand man, Lieutenant Kyle Reese, to 1984 Los Angeles. Entrusted with protecting Sarah Connor, the most important woman on Earth, instead, Reese finds himself in a radically altered timeline after an unforeseen complication in 2029. Now, Sarah has a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator by her side, planning to travel forward in time, in 2017 San Francisco, to prevent the self-aware computer network from going online. First, humankind's arch-enemy was Skynet. This time, it is Cyberdyne's operating system, Genisys. Can we reboot the future to have one?—Nick Riganas In the year 2029, John Connor (Jason Clarke), leader of the human Resistance against Skynet launches a massive final offensive on Los Angeles. He is notified by his unit, Tech-Com, that Skynet will attack on two fronts in the past and future, thereby changing warfare forever. Connor sets up two attack forces, one to strike at Skynet's main defense grid in Colorado, and a second one, led by John and his trusted lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), to infiltrate a Skynet facility in the ruins of San Francisco, California.Once the defense grid is taken down, John, Kyle, and a number of soldiers enter into the San Francisco facility, and find a time machine...one that John has known about for years. John knows that a T-800 Terminator ((Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent back in time to 1984 to kill his mother, Sarah Connor, and Kyle volunteers to go back and save her. However, as the machine prepares to send Kyle back, he is witness to a soldier clamp a hand over John's mouth!It is at this point that Kyle is sent through time, but as he does, he sees a series of fragmented images. He sees a house both new and dilapidated. He is witness to a birthday party, in which he eagerly awaits the launch of an operating system called ""Genisys."" In a final image, he ses a young boy (Bryant Price), telling his mirror reflection, that ""Genisys is Skynet.""In 1984, the T-800 arrives at Griffith Park Observatory. As he demands clothing from some punks, his attention is caught by a nearby voice. He is the confronted by an older T-800, and the two begin to fight. The older T-800 is assisted by a Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), who uses a heavy-weapon to disable the recently-arrived T-800, and stop the battle.Meanwhile, Reese materializes in a dirty alleyway. After stealing a pair of pants off a homeless man, he is confronted by a police officer (Lee Byung-Hun). When Kyle demands to know the date, the officer confirms that it is 1984, but then surprises Kyle when his arm turns into a metal blade, and he attempts to kill the future soldier!Reese manages to take cover in a department store, and obtains more clothing. However, he soon runs into two officers, who subdue and handcuff him. It is then that the T-1000 materializes out of a nearby mirror, and kills one officer, as the other named O'Brien (Wayne Bastrup) and Kyle take cover. O'Brien gives into Kyle's demand to be uncuffed, just as a large armored truck barrels through the front of the store, knocking the T-1000 aside. In the vehicle, Sarah Connor unloads a few rounds into the still-active T-1000, and demands Reese get into the vehicle!As they drive off, Kyle finds out that the original timeline has been altered: Sarah already knows about Skynet, Judgment Day, and his role as her protector. Furthermore, Kyle learns that the T-800 sent from 2029 has already dispatched by Sarah and the new Terminator, who is now known as ""The Guardian"" (or as Sarah sometimes calls him, ""Pops""). As Kyle is taking in the new revelations, the T-1000 attacks the vehicle. The Guardian and Sarah plan to lure the T-1000 into a trap in an abandoned factory. From there, the T-1000 disables the Guardian and re-activates the fallen T-800. The T-1000 then pursues Sarah while Kyle fends off the T-800. After destroying its flesh, Kyle finally destroys the T-800 by blasting its head off. Moments later, Sarah finds herself in a chamber beneath an acid bath set up as a trap for the T-1000, when she's approached by two Kyles. Unsure which Kyle is the actual Kyle and which one is the T-1000, she takes a lucky guess and shoots one of them in the foot. By sheer luck, it's the T-1000, which morphs back into its cop form. After yelling to the real Kyle to run, Sarah fires at the ceiling, unleashing an acid bath on the T-1000. The terminator is mostly melted, although it takes some assistance from Pops to do so (and not without damaging the flesh on Pops' right arm).Sarah then explains to Kyle that the Guardian was sent to protect her from the T-1000 back in 1973, where the Terminator's arrival had caused a fractured timeline that differs from Kyle's. After saving Sarah, the Guardian began training her to face her destiny. The Guardian has built a crude time machine similar to Skynet's and Sarah plans to use it with Kyle to travel to 1997 to change the events that would lead to Skynet's initial attack on humanity. However, Kyle, convinced that the future has changed because of his new memories, persuades Sarah and the Guardian that they should travel to 2017 instead. He believes that Skynet will begin its attack on that year of the altered timeline; Kyle and Sarah time-travel while Pops spends the next 33 years preparing for their arrival.In 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize nude in the middle of a busy highway and are apprehended by police. The Guardian watches from a distance and follows them to a hospital. While being treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn about ""Genisys"", a soon-to-be-unveiled operating system that will be used on every computer system worldwide: they realize that it is Skynet's precursor. She and Kyle are then rescued by John Connor. As he leads the pair to a parking garage, the Guardian appears and shoots John, revealing ""John"" to be a nanomachine hybrid. John has been converted into a T-3000, and explains that shortly after Kyle was sent back, he was infected by a T-5000, and was subsequently transformed. His mission here is to ensure that Cyberdyne would receive Skynet's technology and secure its rise. The T-3000 John tries to convince Sarah and Kyle to join the machines and end the conflict, but they refuse. After a brief battle, the T-3000 is temporarily incapacitated with an MRI machine.The Guardian takes Kyle and Sarah to a safe house in southern Marin County, where they make final preparations to destroy the Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe before it comes online. The T-3000 pursues them to the Golden Gate Bridge, where Kyle, Sarah, and the Guardian are all taken into police custody. While awaiting interrogation, the trio is freed by O'Brien, (J. K. Simmons), who discovers that Kyle and Sarah are time-travelers, and the officer that Kyle and Sarah saved from the T-800's attack back in 1984. The three hijack a helicopter on the rooftop and head toward the Cyberdyne's San Francisco headquarters, with the T-3000 in close pursuit. During the airborne chase, the Guardian itself dive-bombs the T-3000's helicopter, causing it to crash.Emerging from the helicopter crash, the T-3000 enters the Cyberdyne complex and advances the countdown mechanism from 13 hours to 15 minutes. As Genisys begins to gain sentience, the Guardian, Kyle and Sarah plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off the T-3000. After a lengthy battle, the T-3000 reveals its true self before easily defeating the Guardian, only to be attacked by Sarah and Kyle. With not much time left, Sarah and Kyle escape while the Guardian traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of the prototype time machine, where T-3000 manages to throw the Guardian into a vat of mimetic polyalloy liquid just beneath the magnetic field. Kyle and Sarah manage to reach a bunker beneath the facility moments before the time machine explodes, setting off the bombs and preventing Genisys from coming online. The explosion also kills off the T-3000, destroying it once and for all. The Guardian, now upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components that the T-1000 usually has, appears and helps them find a way out of the debris.Later, the trio travel to young Kyle Reese's home, where they repeat the warning about Genisys to young Kyle, ensuring the events leading to their arrival. Sarah is relieved believing that she is now free to choose what to do with her future. She decides to stay with Kyle.In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the Genisys system core was located in a hidden subterranean chamber and has survived the explosion."

Sisters Kate and Maura Ellis are summoned home to clean out their childhood bedroom before their parents sell the family house, much to their dismay. Looking to recapture their glory days, they throw one final high-school-style party for their classmates, which turns into the cathartic rager that a bunch of ground-down adults really need.

Upon reaching their childhood home, they discover the house has already sold, and their parents have already packed up and sold all of the family's belongings, except for the things in the sisters' room.

They look up their old graduating class and decide which ones to invite, specifically leaving out Kate's nemesis Brinda (Maya Rudolph) and a dorky classmate named Alex (Bobby Moynihan), who tries way too hard to be funny. They buy a bunch of party supplies, only to run into Brinda at the supermarket, where she is clearly upset over not getting an invitation to the party. The sisters come across the new owners, the Geernts (Santino Fontana and Britt Lower). The ladies exchange banter with them and mock them for wanting to paint the steps of the house blue and for wanting to take down their old ""sister tree"". They go out and shop for new outfits as well.The sisters get their nails done, and Maura, compassionate to a fault, invites the stylist Vicky, aka Hae-Woo (Greta Lee) and her friends to the party. While at the salon, Maura notices a ""hiring now"" sign and gets Kate to go ask for a job. The manager looks at Kate's bad nail polish job and turns her away, but she makes him appear as though he gave her a job to convince Maura. The last thing they need to do is to cancel dinner with the parents. They go to the retirement resort where they're staying and discover they've caught them in the middle of sex, to everyone's horror.Kate drives Maura by the house of James (Ike Barinholtz), a guy that caught Maura's eye. She awkwardly invites him to the party, which he accepts. When they get home, Maura offers to give Kate a loan since she's supposedly turning her life around. She also asks Kate if she can be the ""party mom"" that night and not drink so Maura can get drunk and let loose. Kate reluctantly agrees.Night falls, and the sisters get ready for guests to arrive. Their old classmates quickly arrive, including Alex, whom Maura invited out of guilt. He starts off by quickly cracking terrible jokes. More guests arrive, but they only mingle and don't actually enjoy themselves. Things pick up when a group of lesbians arrive with their own DJ and get the party going.

Maura and Kate buy some joints and a bag of cocaine, which Maura hides in her bag, which she hides in her cupboard. Unfortunately, Alex, who is acting out ""Scarface"", decides to get too into character and snorts half the bag all at once, causing him to wreak havoc around the house.Maura finds James and smokes a joint with him in the attic. Together, they talk about each other and their personal fears. James says he recently lost weight to build self-confidence, while Maura thinks she is too boring.

James pulls her out, but the floor starts to shake beneath them. They run and end up falling through the ceiling of her bedroom, covered in piles of dust. Still, the two decide to get intimate, after James tries to fix the ceiling. However, Maura lights a Garfield candle that sets off sparks, causing her to drop it on James's crotch. In his panic, he slips on some gel that Kate squeezed out earlier (and never cleaned up) and he falls ass-first onto a ballerina music box, which gets stuck up there. Maura tries to pull it out but cannot, and James leaves annoyed and in pain.Brinda makes another attempt to get into the party, forcing Kate to confront her over why she hates Brinda. This leads to Brinda calling Kate a hothead, making her flip out and giving Brinda an opportunity to take a picture of her crazy self and put it on social media. Moments later, Kate gets a call from Haley, who is with her grandparents. She sees the picture of Kate at the party, still convinced that her mom hasn't changed. Haley calls her mom a loser. Upset, Kate ditches the party mom thing and starts to drink. When she goes out to get more booze, she grabs Maura's bag and looks at her phone to hear a message from Haley, learning that Haley has been staying not with a friend, but with Maura.The sisters, realizing each other's deceptions, confront each other outside the house.

Kate jumps in after her, and everyone helps the two of them climb back out.Kate and Maura are forced to own up to their mistakes by their parents. Kate admits she never got a job, but she is on slightly better terms with Haley. Bucky and Deanna force them to clean up the house. Over the next two weeks, the sisters try to do right and fix the house with the help of their friends. By the end of it, Brinda, having patched things up with Kate, helps sell the house again, to Alex and Hae-Woo, his new girlfriend. Brinda is now with Dave too, despite Kate telling her that he has chlamydia. The sisters reconcile, and Kate urges Maura to go after James. She goes to his house and lies facedown in the pool to call for help. James walks into the pool and kisses her.Four months later, it's Christmas-time.

Months after John's divorce, Ted and Tami-Lynn's marriage seems to be on the same road. To patch things up, Ted and Tami-Lynn plan to have a child with John's help, but their failed efforts backfire disastrously. Namely, Ted is declared property by the government, and he loses all of his civil rights. Now, Ted must fight a seemingly hopeless legal battle with an inexperienced young lawyer to regain his rightful legal status. Unfortunately, between Ted's drunken idiocies and sinister forces interested in this situation to exploit him, Ted's quest has all the odds against him.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) John Bennett has been divorced from Lori Collins for five months. Meanwhile, his best friend Ted marries his girlfriend, Tami-Lynn. One year later, following a heated argument, they decide to have a child. As Ted can not have children, John agrees to help Ted find a sperm donor. They ask Sam J. Jones, but he refuses, due to a low sperm count. Then they try to unsuccessfully break into Tom Brady's house and steal his sperm. Ultimately, John offers to donate his sperm. Despite Ted and John's efforts, Tami-Lynn's historical drug use has rendered her infertile, and the couple decide to adopt. As background checks are carried out, Ted's legal status as a person is brought into question. The opening scene shows Ted (voice of Seth MacFarlane) and Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) are getting married. Sam Jones (himself) is presiding over the nuptials. At the reception we find out that John (Marky Mark) is depressed because he got divorced from Lori six months ago. We also find out that Guy (Patrick Warburton) is dating Rick (Michael Dorn).Ted does a dance sequence on a giant wedding cake over the opening credits.One year later, the honeymoon is over for Ted and Tami-Lynn. Their bills are piling up and neither are making enough money as cashiers at the local grocery store to make ends meet. Teds mad that she spends so much money on clothes and Tami-Lynn is mad that Ted wastes so much money on weed.Ted meets John at McFeltys Pub to complain. The bartender flirts with John, but hes just not interested. John goes into the bathroom and Ted tries to con a free drink out of her by promising not to tell anyone that Jay Leno hangs out there looking for gay bathroom sex. Just then, John rushes out of the bathroom followed by an apologizing Jay Leno.Back at the grocery store, Liam Neeson (himself) stops in and asks if he can buy Trix cereal because the commercials have led him to believe theyre just for kids. Ted assures him its fine. Liam buys the cereal and leaves. A coworker named Joy suggests that Ted and Tami-Lynn have a kid to save their marriage because ""having a baby makes white niggers"" happy-pointing to a white family in the store. So, Ted proposes that to Tami-Lynn and they both agree that shed make a great mom.John and Ted get stoned and watch Law & Order. Ted tells John his plan to have a kid. They decide that Sam Jones would be a great sperm donor because hes Flash Gordonalso, Ted is a teddy bear and doesnt have a dick, so he cant get Tami-Lynn pregnant himself.Sam Jones cant be a donor because his sperm count is 1 on account of all the drugs he did in the 80s (up until earlier today, Id assume). On the way out, they accidentally break Sam Jones car window and bolt. They decide to get the next best thing to a super hero and devise a plan to steal Tom Bradys (himself) sperm.John poses as an A/C repair man and cuts Bradys A/C. That night, Brady opens his bedroom door leading to his balcony to cool off. Ted and John break in to jerk off Tom Brady in his sleep and steal his sperm. Brady wakes up and throws them both out. While hiding, John tells Ted that hes hurt that Ted never asked him to be a donor.They go to a fertility clinic so that John can donate. One of the doctors recognizes Ted from the news and shows him a room where sperm is stored for medical studies. John comes in and they start horsing around. Before you know it, John is on the ground coated in sperm samples. The doctor comes back and tells John that hes covered in rejected Sickle Cell samples. Ted says that he's covered in ""more black guy jizz than a Kardashian.""Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) is now a janitor at Hasbro. He kisses up to an exec (John Carroll Lynch) by telling him that he changes the urinal cakes in his favorite urinal every day because a man that important shouldnt have to smell pee.Tami-Lynn is barren because of all her drug use so the artificial insemination wont work. So she and Ted go to an adoption agency. Again, because of her drug use, they cant adopt. Also, more importantly, Ted is not legally recognized as a human.

His and Tami-Lynn's marriage is annulled as well.John says that they should get a lawyer to prove in court that Ted is a person.The lawyer wont rep them for free, but offers the service of his niece who just passed the bar exam and will take the case pro bono. The niece Samantha Louise Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) takes the case. She's a 26 year old pot-head, but also a super smart lawyer.We go through a lawyering montage where the three of them go through law book and start forming a friendship. Her strain of weed is called Get Me Home and it freaks out Johnny big time. After the montage, they watch Roots. During the Kunte Kinte/Tobe scene, Ted realizes that Kunta is just like him.

He says if they lose the case then Ted will just be property which they can steal, cut open and find out what makes him alive. Then Hasbro can mass produce Teds. The exec asks how much money Donny wants in return. Donny doesnt want money. He just wants his own Ted. So the exec says that theyll hire the best lawyer around Shep Wild (John Slattery) to fight Sam in court.During the court case, both sides argue very well.

But every silver lining has a cloud, and Zach's comes when he learns that Hannah has a mysterious dad who is revealed to be R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the author of the bestselling ""Goosebumps"" series. There is a reason why Stine is so strange: he is a prisoner of his own imagination, the monsters that his books made famous are real, and Stine protects his readers by keeping them locked up in their books.

It's up to Stine, Zach, Hannah, and Zach's friend Champ (Ryan Lee) to put all the monsters back in their books.

However, Zach meets Hannah again but they are caught by Stine. Zach believes that Stine is an abusive father and he breaks in his house with Champ to seek out Hannah. When Zach opens a book in Stine's library, he accidentally unleashes a monster from the book.

But Zach released the evil Slappy that promises to bring havoc to Greendale opening all the books on the same time.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Moving to a new town can be harsh, especially for Zach Cooper. He quickly befriends his next-door neighbor Hannah, despite the fact that her crazy father wants her safe from the outside world. Hannah's father is none other than Goosebumps author R. L. Stine who is imprisoned within his own wild imagination as his creations are actually real live monsters. He keeps them locked up in their individual manuscripts. Unfortunately, Zach unwittingly releases a villainous ventriloquist dummy named Slappy who intends to unleash an army of Stine's monsters in an attempt to get revenge on Stine himself. Now it's up to Stine, Zach, Hannah, and Champ to send the monsters back into their manuscripts in order to save themselves and the town.—Blazer346 A teenager named Zach (Dylan Minnette) reluctantly moves from New York City to the quiet town of Madison, Delaware, where he quickly realizes that his reclusive new neighbor is in fact the horror author of the Goosebumps series. Zach learns Stine's identity when he is drawn to the writer's daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush), but soon discovers the dangerous secret inside their home -- the creatures from Stine's famous stories are real, and are kept locked away inside their original manuscripts. After an accident frees the monsters, Zach, Hannah, and their nerdy pal Champ (Ryan Lee) must work together with Stine to save their town from destruction.. Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) is reluctantly moving from New York City to Madison, Delaware with his mother, Gale (Amy Ryan). Arriving at the new house, he is greeted by the neighbor, a beautiful girl named Hannah (Odeya Rush). Her father, R. L. Stine (Jack Black) gruffly tells him to stay on his side of the fence.In his room, Zach watches a video of the New York mayor paying tribute to his father, a fireman who was killed in the line of duty. The next day, he goes to his new school where his mom is the vice principal. At an assembly, his mom talks about tomorrow's fall dance. A kid named Champ (Ryan Lee) sits down next to Zach and awkwardly tries to chat.That night, when Zach is taking out the garbage, Hannah walks up and startles him. He says he didn't see her in school, and she tells him that she's homeschooled. She asks him to take a walk with her, and she leads him into a forest. They arrive at an abandoned theme park, and they climb up to the top of a Ferris wheel. He tells her about his father, and she says that she never knew her mother, and her dad keeps moving her from town to town.Back on the ground, they walk home, and Hannah's dad grabs her shoulder and orders her back inside. The next night, Zach hears a scream coming from Hannah's house. He runs over and is met by Mr. Stine, who tells him to go back home. He runs home and dials 911, and the police show up at Mr. Stine's door. Zach asks where Hannah is, and Mr. Stine says that she's staying in London with her mom. Another scream echoes through the house, and the cops force their way in. The scream came from the TV set. Gale apologizes and takes Zach home.That night, Gale leaves to chaperone the dance, and Zach's aunt Lorraine comes over to babysit. Zach looks into the neighbors' window, and sees the silhouette of Hannah in the house. He goes to his room, shuts the door, makes a phone call and opens the window to sneak out. Champ meets him in the driveway, and they go over to the house together. After Mr. Stine leaves, Zach jimmies the lock on the cellar door and they walk in. He finds the floor covered with bear traps. Going upstairs, he finds a study with shrunken heads, voodoo dolls and a sarcophagus. On a shelf, he sees books bound in leather with locks on the front. Champ recognizes the titles as Goosebumps books. Finding a key, Zach opens up the book ""The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena."" Just then, a shadowy figure swings a baseball bat at Champ's head.Zach pushes Champ out of the way at the last second, and then turns on a light. He sees Hannah standing there. She asks what he's doing in her house, but then notices the unlocked book. He picks it up to put it away, but it pops open. Suddenly, a fifteen-foot snowman appears, bounding out through a wall and running off into the forest. Hannah grabs the book and runs after the monster, with Zach and Champ running after.Following the trail of destruction, they arrive at an ice rink. They see Hannah climb in through a broken window, and they follow. They find Hannah in the middle of the ice, still holding the book. They walk out to her, and candy rains down around them. They see a vending machine flying through the air toward them, and they scatter as the machine crashes down on the ice. Hannah tells them the only way to get rid of the monster is to suck it back into the book. As the monster runs toward her, she opens up the book, and it starts to get sucked in, but then lifts an arm and swats the book out of her hands. Hannah runs toward the book, but the monster slams his fist down, causing her to lose her balance and fall. Zach grabs a hockey stick and knocks the book across the ice. Champ gets on a Zamboni, and the monster chases him. It destroys the Zamboni with one blow as Champ jumps free and slides into the penalty box. The monster turns toward the other two, but they manage to slide into the box and shut the door. The monster pounds on the Plexiglas, and it starts to crack.Mr. Stine shows up and opens the book, and the monster gets sucked in, turning into letters as it gets close to the page. He shuts the book and orders them all into the car. On the ride home, Zach goads Mr. Stine to reveal his true identity as the author of the Goosebumps series. Back at home, Hannah's dad tells her that they'll have to move again. Zach steps into the house, and Mr. Stine instinctively throws a candelabra at his head. His throw is wide, and Zach demands to know what's going on. Mr. Stine tells him that as a child, he had severe allergies that kept him indoors, and the neighborhood kids would taunt him and throw rocks at his window. He made up monsters that would terrorize the other kids, and one day they became real, leaping off the page. He says they're safe as long as the books stay locked. He and Hannah grab the books, and Zach finds ""Night of the Living Dummy"" on the floor with a broken lock.They hear laughter, and see a living dummy named Slappy (Avery L Jones) sitting in the chair. Mr. Stine approaches Slappy with the book, but Slappy lights a match and sets the pages on fire. Slappy leaves the house with the rest of the books. Going to the kitchen, they find lawn gnomes popping out from everywhere. A gnome tosses a knife that just misses Zach's head. Another group of gnomes ties up Mr. Stine, and drag him toward the oven, which they have turned on. Frantically, the kids smash all of the gnomes, thinking they have won. But then, the pieces of porcelain fly back together.They run through the basement, dodging the bear traps. The gnomes follow, but fall into the traps and get shattered. The group runs out, locking the door behind them. Outside, they find a pile of burned books. They drive around town looking for Slappy, finding only destruction everywhere. There's a thump on the hood of the car, and a tiny hand print appears on the windshield. The Invisible Boy climbs up to the roof, reaches in and grabs Champ. He lifts Champ up and starts slapping him. Mr. Stine hits the brakes, and Invisible Boy flies off the car. Driving onto Main Street, they find people frozen into statues. Zach tells Mr. Stine that if he wrote the monsters into life, he could write them out with a story where they were all captured. Mr. Stine says he can only write a story on his personal typewriter, or else it won't work. The typewriter is in a display case at the school. On the ride, Zach tries to talk to Hannah, but Mr. Stine puts his hand between them. Distracted, Mr. Stine doesn't see the people in the road, and runs into them and through them. They were ghosts. He drives into the leg of a giant praying mantis.Speeding off with the mantis in pursuit, he drives into a supermarket parking lot and crashes into a parked car. The group runs into the store as the mantis smashes the car. Hannah tells them they can get to the school by cutting across a cemetery. They grab some chips and soda, and Hannah sees that Zach has a cut on his forehead. She dabs it with antiseptic. In the meat section, they see a werewolf gnawing on a steak. They try to sneak by, but the wolf hears them and starts running their way.They all split up, and the wolf chases Mr. Stine. In the pets section, Zach finds a rubber steak and tosses it across the store. The wolf charges after it, and the group runs for the exit. The wolf sees them and resumes chase. Zach turns over a mop bucket, and the wolf slips and slides as they run out the door, slamming it shut behind them. The wolf breaks down the door, and the group finds themselves trapped in the back parking lot, with the wolf rapidly closing distance.Suddenly, they see headlights, and a car rams the wolf, knocking it into a brick wall. Aunt Lorraine pops her head out. Zach tells her to go to the police station and have the cops meet them at the school. At the station, Lorraine finds only Slappy, and some aliens pop out and shoot her with a freeze-ray gun. The group walks across the cemetery, and Hannah gets her jacket tangled in the fingers of a statue. Zach helps her get free, but when the moonlight hits her, she starts to fade away. Zach realizes she's not a real person, just another character Mr. Stine created. Suddenly, a hand reaches out from the grave and grabs his ankle.Zach gets himself free from the grip of a graveyard ghoul, but more pop out from the ground and give chase. The group runs to the back gate, and the kids get through. The ghouls grab Mr. Stine and pull him back, and the kids grab his arms. A tug-of-war ensues, and Mr. Stine kicks the ghouls in the face, causing them to let go. Making it to the school, the group sees kids dancing, and they look through the cases for the typewriter. Stine finds it, and tells the kids to warn the other students to barricade the doors while he writes. At the football field, Slappy gathers the monsters he already set free, and then unleashes the rest, saving one for the perfect time.At the dance, Zach gets on the microphone and tells everyone there are monsters outside, and they have to lock the doors. At first, nobody takes him seriously, but when they look out, they see the mantis squashing cars in the parking lot. Everyone panics, but Zach tells them they need to barricade the school. He tells them to grab anything that can be used as a weapon. They grab mops and buckets, and various sports equipment. Then they put desks in front of the gym doors. Tiny robots with laser eyes break through, and twelve-foot scarecrows punch holes in the windows.Stine furiously types out a story, and Slappy approaches. Slappy tells him that they share a consciousness since they are really the same person. Slappy says that if he stops, Slappy will let him live. When he refuses, Slappy slams the lid on his hands, breaking his fingers.The kids find Stine, and they grab the typewriter and run into the storage room with the rest of the students and lock the door. The monsters bang on the windows. Stine sees a line of buses, and he says that if he can drive off in one, he'll lead the monsters away. Zach sees a tackling dummy in the corner and gets an idea. A bus drives off, and Slappy tells the monsters to kill Stine. The mantis catches up to the bus and kicks it across the road, causing it to crumple in a heap. The monsters approach the bus, and find only the tackling dummy inside. A ghoul sees a thread on the outside of the bus and pulls on it, causing the bus to explode.Stine drives the kids away in another bus, dictating to Zach what to write. Stine knows that Slappy will find him wherever he goes, since they share thoughts. He tells them he needs to go to a place he's never seen before, to buy time before Slappy can find them. Hannah tells him to go to the abandoned amusement park. They all hide in a funhouse, with Zach typing as fast as he can. Slappy finds them, and unleashes the last monster.The Blob pops out of the pages, and the group runs for the exit. Outside, the monster army is waiting for them, and the kids run to the Ferris wheel. Stine tells Zach that he can finish the book on his own. The kids climb up the Ferris wheel as the Blob eats Stine with one gulp. Hannah cries out, but Champ sees that he's still alive inside the body. The monster army starts climbing the Ferris wheel. Zach types out, ""As the monsters converged, Zach closed his eyes, opened the book, and the monsters were swallowed back into the world of paper and ink, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. THE END!"" The mantis gnaws at the bolts of the wheel, and it rolls off the base and sends them crashing to the ground.The kids crawl out of the seat, and Hannah tells Zach to open up the book. Zach realizes that Hannah will also disappear. Zach grabs it and opens it up, causing all of the monsters to get sucked in. He grabs and holds Hannah as her body loses substance. As the Blob gets dragged along, Stine is able to free himself, but Slappy grabs onto him, trying not to fall into the book. Stine kicks Slappy, causing him to land in the center of the vortex. Hannah kisses Zach before getting drawn into the book. Champ shuts it, and the wind dies down.Months later, the town is rebuilt, and the school reopens. Zach is now the most popular kid in class. He and Champ go into English class together, and a new teacher introduces himself. ""Hello, my name is R. L. Stine,"" he says, noting that their regular teacher was still recovering from an attack by a mutant insect. Zach tells him that he really misses Hannah, and Stine tells him that she's still alive in their minds and hearts, and also down the hallway. Stine tells Zach that he might have written one more book. Hannah hugs Zach as Stine burns the book.Stine finds his typewriter, and sees the keys move on their own, and on the paper appears, ""The Invisible Boy's Revenge."" He sees his scared reflection in a glass window, and next to it, a tiny hand print."

Sam has been one of the best arcade gamers of his time. Once in an international tournament NASA sent the video recording of all the games to space for intelligent beings to find and know more about humans. However the aliens interpreted the games as a challenge and began attacking Earth using the video game data. It's now up to Sam and other old time arcade game champions to save the Earth from the video game alien invasion.—Keith Francis In 1982, the boy Sam Brenner disputes the video game arcade championship and loses the title to Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant playing Donkey Kong. This defeat affects his life and in the present days, Brenner is an installer of audio and video systems. His best friend Will Cooper is the President of the United States. Brenner is installing a system at the house of Violet Van Patten, who has just divorced, for her son Matty. Out of the blue, he is summoned to the White House and he finds that Violet is a military that works there. Soon he learns that an American base was attacked by aliens. When he meets his friend Ludlow ""The Wonder Kid"" Lamansoff, he discovers that the aliens have found a time capsule sent by the US Government to the space with a videocassette of videogame and understood that it was a declaration of war. The aliens broadcast a challenge to Earth to play and win a videogame against them; otherwise Earth will be destroyed. Now the last hope on Earth is Brenner, Cooper, Ludlow, Violet and Eddie.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war against them, they attack the Earth using games like PAC-MAN, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Centipede and Space Invaders as models for their various assaults. President Will Cooper has to call on his childhood best friend, '80s video game champion Sam Brenner, to lead a team of old-school arcaders to defeat aliens and save the planet: Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) the ""Centipede"" champ, and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) the ""Donkey Kong"" champ. At a video-game arcade in 1982 with his friend Will Cooper, 13-year-old Sam Brenner discovers he can master the games by spotting patterns. Participating in a video-game championship, he loses in a match with obnoxious arcade player Eddie Plant in Donkey Kong. A videocassette with footage of the event is included in a time capsule that is launched into space. 33 years later, Brenner has become an installer of home-theater systems while Cooper is the President of the United States. In Guam, a U.S. military base is attacked by UFOs of Galaga that turn pieces of the base into small glowing cubes and one of the soldiers is abducted.. In the summer of 1982, a young Sam Brenner rides his bicycle to the home of his best friend Will Cooper to tell him the new arcade in town is open. They spend the whole day there, with Brenner dominating almost every game while Cooper excels at the crane machine and wins a Chewbacca mask. Seeing how awesome Brenner is at games, Cooper grabs a flyer for the arcade game world championships and says Brenner should bring his skills here.At the event, the MC (Dan Aykroyd) tells everyone that a time capsule will be launched into space containing elements of the present culture. Brenner and Cooper meet Ludlow Lamonsoff, a weird but brilliant kid who's in love with Lady Lisa, the main character of the game Dojo Quest. After Brenner gets through every game, he faces hotshot gamer Eddie Plant in Donkey Kong. Eddie mentions the pattern of the game, causing Brenner to lose focus and come in second place.In the present day, the adult Brenner (Adam Sandler) works for a company that installs software. Cooper (Kevin James) is the President of the United States, and he is frequently mocked in the media, most recently for failing to read properly during a kindergarten class and yelling at a little girl.In Guam, a military base picks up a threatening signal. Alien life forms based off the designs of Galaga attack. The soldiers try to fight back but are easily taken out. One soldier (Affion Crockett) gets taken by the aliens.Brenner goes to a home to do his job. He meets a lady named Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) and her son Matty (Matt Lintz), who tells Brenner that his mom is going through a divorce. While Brenner goes to work, he hears Violet crying in the closet. He comforts her by listening to her situation, and they share wine. He thinks they're having a moment, and he goes in for a kiss but gets shut down. He then gets a call from Cooper telling him to be at the White House soon.Brenner heads to the White House with Violet close by. To his surprise, he finds out she is a Lieutenant Colonel. Cooper brings Brenner into the Oval Office to show him the Galaga aliens attacking.Later, Brenner drives his van home to find Ludlow (Josh Gad) in there. Ludlow brings Brenner back to his home where he says that the aliens are sending creatures with classic video game designs to attack. Ludlow received a message using manipulated footage of 1980's icons like Ronald Reagan and Madonna to explain their plans: since they perceived the items in the time capsule as a declaration of war, they are using the video games as a challenge, giving the people of Earth three rounds to fight back or it's game over for everyone. They also show that the soldier they took was a ""trophy"". They show the video to Cooper and determine that the next attack will happen in India. Sure enough, the aliens attack the Taj Mahal, and they take an Indian man as a trophy as well.Brenner and Ludlow are brought in to ""train"" soldiers to fight back by showing them how to play these games, to which Admiral Porter (Brian Cox) objects. Violet shows Brenner and Ludlow that the pixels are taken down by strong light beams. Cooper is with his wife Jane (Jane Krakowski) at a bakery when his assistant comes in to tell him that the next attack will happen in London.Everyone heads to London to meet with Corporal Hill (Sean Bean). The soldiers brace for attack as the creatures from Centipede attack. Brenner tells the men to shoot for the head and anticipate the pattern, but they have no luck. Brenner and Ludlow take over with permission from Cooper, and they blast away at the Centipede. The final boss makes its way into town and nearly devours a boy until Brenner blasts it away for good.The aliens send a message using the Fantasy Island guys to congratulate Earth on their victory, and they give them the Duck Hunt dog as a trophy, but remind them that they (aliens) are leading 2-1. It is learned that the next attack will happen in New York City. Needing more help, Ludlow and Cooper agree that they need someone else to help them.Brenner, Cooper, and Violet go to a prison to find Eddie (Peter Dinklage), a bitter and hardened criminal who got busted for adding charges to phone bills. He still taunts Brenner and makes self-serving demands in exchange for his help, among them a private island for himself, never paying taxes again, and a meeting with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Cooper agrees to let him out of prison... but only with the 'no taxes' agreement.The team goes to New York to discover that the next boss is Pac-Man. Violet presents the guys with four cars based off the ghosts in Pac-Man, with the fourth car driven by the game's creator Toru Iwatani (Denis Akiyama). When the team gets downtown Manhattan where Pac-Man is chomping through everything, Iwatani tries to appeal to Pac-Man's good side by talking to him like a father. Unfortunately, this gets his hand chomped and pixelated. The remaining three chase after Pac-Man. He eats a power pellet, giving him ten seconds to be able to eat the ghosts, and he eats Ludlow's car as he jumps out.. Eddie hits the first Pac-Man after catching up to him quickly. The second one also gets taken out by Eddie. The third causes him to drive into the water. Brenner chases him near a parking garage where Pac-Man finds another power pellet. Brenner counts down and drives backward through a parking garage. At the last second, the power pellet wears off and gives Brenner a chance to defeat Pac-Man, and they're given Q*Bert as a trophy.The team has a ball held for them as thanks for their heroics. Brenner asks Violet to be his date, and she stuns him when she arrives in a green dress. Eddie brings Serena Williams (who only showed up because she was promised an island). After Brenner spends time with Violet, the aliens send another message saying the rules have been violated, and they will launch a full-scale attack momentarily. Marty finds Eddie and sees that his shades that were fished out of the water contain cheat codes, which allowed him to beat Pac-Man and also explains how he beat Brenner in Donkey Kong. Eddie flees, and Matty is taken by the aliens as Violet watches.Q*Bert tells the heroes that the aliens were peaceful until they felt threatened by the time capsule. They realize they have to go to the ship and stop the aliens.The aliens bring down more video games upon Washington DC, including Frogger and Defender. Brenner, Violet, and Q*Bert gear up and are joined by Cooper while Ludlow stays behind to fight. One of the aliens takes the form of Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson), to Ludlow's joy. However, she still fights him until he says he only wants to love her. She drops her swords, and they kiss. Eddie comes to fight and apologizes for ditching the team.Brenner, Violet, Cooper and Q*Bert get brought up to the ship where Brenner faces his biggest challenge... Donkey Kong. The ape rolls barrels down as the heroes try to reach Matty and the other two captives. Matty tells Brenner that Eddie cheated all those years ago, making him realize he is the true DK champ. Brenner takes the hammer and smashes the barrels before hurling it at Donkey Kong, destroying him. This causes the rest of the video games to freeze and be brought back up to the ship. Unfortunately for Ludlow, that includes Lady Lisa.The team is recognized as heroes before the White House. Cooper announces he's made a peace treaty with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating and admits he's the best in the world. Ludlow misses Lisa until Q*Bert randomly morphs into her. Brenner and Violet become a couple. Eddie then gets a text from Serena to meet him in the bedroom, along with Martha Stewart, who made sandwiches. Eddie sneaks off with excitement. The aliens leave Earth, and Iwatani's hand is restored.One year later, Ludlow has married Lisa, and they're the proud parents of five Q*Berts."
The Intern,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2361509/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Seventy-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be. Seizing an opportunity to get back in the game, he becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, founded and run by Jules Ostin. A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom.—grantss Starting a new job can be a difficult challenge, especially if you're already retired. Looking to get back into the game, 70-year-old widower Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) seizes the opportunity to become a senior intern at an online fashion site. Ben soon becomes popular with his younger co-workers, including Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the boss and founder of the company. Whittaker's charm, wisdom and sense of humor help him develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules. Fed up with having all the time in the world to do nothing, Ben Whittaker, a septuagenarian retired widower, signs up to the seniors' intern programme of About the Fit: the booming start-up of founder and CEO, Jules Ostin. Having absolutely no idea about fashion, while being equally clueless about the Internet, before long, sophisticated, retro-cool Ben manages to win over his much younger colleagues with his effortless charm. Is a dash of good, old-school know-how what Jules' company needs?—Nick Riganas Senior citizen Ben (Robert DeNiro) shoots a video resume for an intern job he wants. He's responding to a flyer asking for senior citizens to apply for an internship via a video stating why they should be hired. He says he's a 70-year-old widower living a comfortable life but feels he needs to be more productive. He gets a call for an interview.The company is called 'About The Fit' and is run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). Originally started from her kitchen, the online clothes retailing company now has gained more than 200 employees since its founding only 18 months earlier. We first see Jules answering a customer service call from a bride complaining that her bridesmaids dresses are the wrong color. Jules takes full responsibility, is very helpful, promises to fix the glitch and even gives her own number to the bride. She moves around in her office on a bike, rarely has time to stop and celebrate co-workers' birthdays in the office or have a complete conversation with her mother.At his interview with a series of people, Ben reveals that he used to work for a company that made phone books. The interviewer (Nat Wolff) also asks him where he sees himself in the next ten years and then realizes the question really doesn't apply. He tells him that he did great in his interviews and video and is quite overqualified for the job.Jules's co-worker Cameron (Andrew Rannels) informs her that Ben is going to be her intern, and they had jointly agreed to the outreach program a few month ago. She asks and is advised that the minimum time for her to put up with him is six weeks, since she has to make an example.Ben takes care to dress impeccably for his first day at work. Jason (Adam Devine) shows him and three other interns (two senior citizens including Celia Watson as Doris, and a young man, Zack Pearl as Davis). While Davis sets up his table with various gadgets, Ben's table has basic stationery and a simple calculator and watch. The other employees are friendly and help him start up the computer.He is informed by Jules's assistant Becky that he has a meeting with her at exactly 3.55 pm, and he should be prompt because there's another meeting at 4:00 pm. Becky also tells him to talk fast and blink a lot, because her boss is disturbed by people who do not. In the meeting, Jules informs him that she will not have much for him to do. However, she will email him if something comes up.He does not hear from her for a few days. Nonetheless he makes himself productive, getting to know the ropes around the place and learning how to deal with the technology. He helps whomever he can and is referred to as Mr. Congeniality by Cameron. In addition, he also gives old school sensible advice to the youngsters when they need it, such as telling Jason to talk properly to Becky for cheating on her since his evasive text messages did not get any response.His first task assigning email is from Becky, asking him to have Jules's jacket cleaned. She spilled soy sauce on it, but she's wearing it and he has to get it from her. In the office, Cameron is telling Jules that their investors think that it's all going too fast at About The Fit and a seasoned CEO could handle affairs better and help them keep up with their success. Ben overhears this. Jules is clearly upset at the thought of having a boss although she admits that they have problems. Cameron advises her to look at the list of CEOs they have and take her time to meet them and decide on one.Ben starts to be noticed more and more around the office especially after he is lauded by having a bell rung for him (an office practice to highlight good performance) for clearing out a desk that was the office dumping spot and routinely got on Jules's nerves. The office masseuse Fiona (Renee Russo) gives him a massage and it's evident he is attracted to her, as Davis needs to give him a magazine to put on his lap commenting he is not as old as Davis thought.One day Ben notices the driver who drives Jules around drinking on the job and tells him to inform Jules he can not drive, or he will have to spill the beans. Ben takes over. She informs him that she can not sit in the front and that she will be making calls in the back, the contents of which should stay confidential. Her first call is from her mother who informs her that women who sleep less are more likely to gain weight. They clearly don't have a great equation. She calls Cameron next and tells him she is meeting one of the CEOs on the list. The meeting is very short. Cameron isn't convinced she is really trying. Ben has meanwhile bought her a cup of soup having realized that she hasn't eaten. While dropping her at home, he tells her he believes she should rest more and when she is in doubt she should remember that she started the company from nothing.At home, we see her daughter Paige and husband Matt, who is a stay at home dad. He looks disappointed the CEO thing did not work out. He is very involved, and their daughter seems loved and happy. Jules falls asleep in her daughter's bed, and when she returns to her own, Matt is asleep and too tired to make love.Becky calls Ben the next morning telling him Jules's driver is not responding to her calls, and he needs to pick her up. Matt invites Ben in for a coffee while he waits. Paige and Matt seem to like him. Ben quietly observes the dynamics at home and the school playground where the other moms seem to look down on Jules for being a busy career woman while she is dropping Paige. Later on, she handles a situation at their warehouse, and he seems impressed.Ben goes to see Fiona at her office where she gives him a foot rub. Davis suddenly walks in, confuses what he sees from his angle for a blow job, and runs away. Lewis (Jason Orley) has to deliver a package to an address he thinks may be Jay Z's, and Ben gives him sartorial advice. Jason also seems to have made progress with Becky after talking to her like Ben suggested.One day while Jules is working late, and Ben is working on his computer waiting around to drop her home, she brings over her pizza to talk and eat with him. He asks her about a meeting she had with another CEO that didn't go too well either. He tells her about his previous employment, which was actually in the same building before phone books became redundant altogether. They bond, and she helps him set up his Facebook account, and friends him, finding out more about him in the process.The next day, Doris comes to pick her up. The minimum period she had to put up with an intern, six weeks, is over, and Ben has been transferred. The 72-year-old Doris can not drive, and Jules takes over, while calling Cameron asking for Ben back. She goes to find him in a coffee shop where he is picking up coffee for the department he currently works at. She helps him with the coffee, apologizes, tells him she feels calmer in his presence and offers him his old job back. She also moves him closer to her work space, right next to Becky. Becky starts crying because she is already overwhelmed with her workload and is threatened by the new development as she is a Business graduate from Penn, who can't seem to do anything right. Jason steps in to comfort her and gives her Ben's hanky, while Ben calms her down, so she isn't threatened by him.Ben begins to give insightful opinions and shows that he has useful experience. Jules gives him more and more responsibility, surprising Cameron. Ben also points out Becky's input and degree encouraging Jules to say something nice to Becky. Davis, who had a deadline for moving out from his parents, declares he is moving to Philadelphia to crash with his cousin. Realizing his commute will be crazy, Ben offers him a room in his house. He is impressed with Ben's house and wardrobe, especially his affinity for handkerchiefs which Ben insists gentlemen must carry.The next morning at Jules's, Matt turns down a trip to San Francisco where Jules has to meet a CEO on account of school activities Paige is looking forward to. Jules has a work crisis to deal with, during which a phone call from her mother makes her mad. She writes a ranting email about her overbearing mother to Matt but accidentally sends it to her mom. She asks her coworkers to do something about it. Ben volunteers to go to her mother's house and delete it from her laptop before she comes back from work at 5.30 pm. Jason, Davis and Lewis accompany him and after some glitches they get the job done. That night Jules takes them out for drinks and gets to know them for the first time. Jules gets drunk and vomits in a trash bin outside.Meanwhile, Ben and Fiona have gotten close. He takes her to a funeral of another friend as their first official date.When Ben goes to pick up Jules the morning after that, he finds Matt sick and Paige in tears at the prospect of going to a party with a sitter, so he agrees to take her instead. In a very dignified manner, he defends Jules's career and professionalism in front of the catty moms making it sound like partly their victory that one of their own made it so big.Paige is not feeling well, so they leave the party early. However, he finds that Matt was faking his illness to meet another mom who he is clearly having an affair with when he sees him walk out of another rowhouse with the woman whom he gets into her car with and drives away. Since Paige is asleep, Ben waits a few hours for Matt's return by driving around the neighborhood. He drops a sleeping Paige off when Matt is back home. Matt asks Ben's take on the CEO situation saying he hopes it will be good for them. Ben replies that that a CEO will not be able to fix what is wrong in their house. Matt seems unnerved, but back at the office (where Jules is finally part of a co-workers birthday celebrations) Ben is in worse shape as his blood pressure acts up, and his co-workers show concern for his health.They take off for San Francisco the next day. Jules tells him she knows there's something he isn't telling her since he doesn't look directly at her and blinks little. He admits to being a softy despite his manly exterior and suggests they enjoy their first class plane ride.That night a fire alarm goes off in their hotel. When Ben escorts Jules back to her room, it is clear she wants company. She invites him in and asks him about his marriage, eventually confiding in him that she found out 18 days ago that Matt was cheating on her. Ben told her he saw them the previous day as Jules breaks down. He comforts her and tells her she should only hire the CEO if she wants to, not for anyone else, and she should be able to have both a great career and a good marriage.The next day, her meeting with the CEO takes longer than most of her meetings so far. When she is done, she tells Ben that she hired him on the spot, though the CEO told her to sleep on it. Back at home she informs Matt and tells him she thinks it will be great for us. He asks ""who the us"" refers to, and she clarifies that she meant Jules and Matt, not About The Fit. However, she breaks down as she is taking a bath that night, showing she is clearly unhappy with her decision.She visits Ben in the morning, and is pleasantly surprised to see Davis and then Fiona emerge from his apartment. She tells him it still feels like it is a right decision. He recalls the time at the warehouse and tells her no one will have the commitment she has to her company, even if they have more experience. He doesn't see how giving up her company in hopes that her husband will stop having an affair adds up, and tells her she came here because she wanted to hear it. She adds that it is also because he is her best friend.The bridesmaid from the customer service call she took at the beginning of the movie has sent her pictures of the bridal party and a thank you note. Also, the CEO she met in San Fransisco sent her some flowers. She asks Becky to put him on the phone in a decisive voice. Just then, Matt walks in saying she should not hire the CEO for him. She needs to do what's right for her. She informs him that she is aware of his affair as he is about to admit to it and asks if it is over. They recommit to each other and promise to do better. Jules tells him she was going to call the CEO and tell him that she changed her mind. They kiss. She goes after Ben to tell him that she changed her mind, to find him in a Tai Chi group. She joins him, finally letting herself relax."
Bridge of Spies,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3682448/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers. In 1957, lawyer James B. Donovan is recruited from his prestigious law firm to defend accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. It's an unenviable task in many respects. Donovan hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II. Also, the strong anti-Communist mood at the time makes him a target from who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. Just such a scenario comes into play when in 1960 U-2 spy pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down over Soviet territory and taken prisoner. Donovan is again recruited to act as the intermediary and negotiate swapping Able for the American requiring him to travel to East Berlin crossing the newly built Berlin Wall.—garykmcd After Abel, the Russian spy is caught, the US wants to make sure he gets a fair trial so they need someone to defend him. And the man who gets the dubious honor is Jim Donovan who tries to give him a good defense but the government seems intent on making sure he gets convicted. And when Abel is found guilty, Donovan pleads for Abel not to be executed because who knows they might need him as a bargaining chip if an American is captured by the Russians. And when U2 pilot Gary Powers is captured, someone from East Germany sends Donovan a letter claiming to be able to broker an exchange; Powers for Abel. When the CIA learns of this, they want Donovan to go there and broker the deal. He agrees. But when he arrives he is informed that another American is being held by the Germans and he could be the one that's being offered for Abel. But the CIA tells Donovan Powers is the priority. Donovan tries to get both men.—rcs0411@yahoo.com A European man living in the US, Rudolph Abel, is arrested as a Russian spy. An American lawyer, James Donovan, takes on his case but, faced with overwhelming evidence and a biased judge, loses the case. Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the ""U-2 Spy"", is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap.—grantss In 1957, during the Cold War, the insurance lawyer James B. Donovan is assigned by the Bar association to defend in court the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, who was captured by the FBI. Donovan is successful and Rudolf is sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death penalty. Meanwhile the American pilot and spy Francis Gary Powers is arrested by the Soviet government while taking photos from a spy plane that crashed. The CIA summons Donovan to help in the negotiation to exchange the two spies. When Donovan learns that the American student Frederic Pryor was arrested in the border of East Berlin while trying to bring his German girlfriend to the West Berlin, he decides to include the student in the negotiation. However his proposal is not supported by the CIA that is interested in Powers only. Further, Powers is prisoner of the soviet government and Pryor is prisoner of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Will Donovan succeed in his intent?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in 1957, at the height of the Cold War, both the United States and Soviet Union employed spies against each other out of fear regarding the nuclear capabilities of one another.In Brooklyn, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is painting a self-portrait. He receives a phone call. He never speaks but only listens to what he hears. Abel leaves his apartment and walks around the city, unaware of a man, Agent Blasco (Domenick Lombardozzi) stepping out of a cab to follow him. Blasco follows Abel through the subway station where he is joined by Agent Gamber (Victor Verhaeghe). Abel ends up at a park where he sits on a bench to paint. He recovers a coin under a bench. He returns to his apartment and uses a razor to split the coin open, where he finds that it contains a piece of paper. Soon, Blasco and Gamber, joined by other FBI agents, storm into Abel's home and arrest him for espionage.We meet lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) in his workplace discussing a client with his co-worker. He is brought into the office of his associate Thomas Watters Jr (Alan Alda) to discuss the case of Abel. Donovan is given the report on Abel's case, and Donovan knows what kind of reputation he would gain for defending a suspected spy.Donovan has dinner with his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) and kids Carol (Eve Hewson), Roger (Noah Schnapp) and Peggy (Jillian Lebling). Carol is upset because her date stood her up. Donovan tells his family about the case, just as his other co-worker Doug Forrester (Billy Magnussen) enters with documents involving the case.In a motel room, pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is undergoing a lie detector test. Later, he and a group of fellow pilots are brought into a room where they are told their mission - they are to become spies for the CIA to detect any nuclear activity occurring in the Soviet Union.Donovan meets with Abel in prison. Abel never admits to any wrongdoing and doesn't want to fully cooperate with the United States government.On a rainy night, Donovan is followed by CIA Agent Hoffman (Scott Shepherd). The two sit together at a bar where Hoffman tries to get Donovan to tell him what Abel is telling Donovan, for the sake of the country, though Donovan refuses to say anything.The pilots are brought into the Peshawar Air Station to see the U-2 planes that they will use in their mission, complete with cameras and the like.Roger's class watches a video on the dangers of nuclear warfare and the precautions that ought to be taken in the event of a catastrophe. He then sets up his own ""duck and cover"" station at home, worrying his father.Abel's trial begins, and nobody is on Donovan's side. The people in court think Abel deserves the death penalty for his supposed crimes, and nobody thinks Donovan can get Abel acquitted. On the train, everyone that Donovan sees is reading unkind headlines for his case, and one woman on the train looks at him scornfully. To make things worse, someone shoots at the Donovan home one evening, harming no one, but also not earning any sympathy for the family as most of the country thinks Donovan is a traitor.By the end of the trial, Abel is found guilty on all charges, but Donovan convinces the judge to give him a 30 year prison sentence instead of the death penalty.Powers and his comrades undergo their mission over the USSR. His plane suddenly takes a hit as it's shot down by a ground-to-air missile. He goes down but manages to eject himself from the plane and sail down on his parachute. Powers is later captured and held by the Soviet Union.In West Germany, American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) rides his bike by the construction site of the Berlin Wall, to meet his girlfriend Katje (Nadja Bobyleva). Pryor is confronted by East German Stasi agents who find him suspicious. He shows off his books to prove he is a student, but he is subsequently arrested.With both American men in detainment, an exchange is planned between the U.S. and USSR to trade Abel for Powers. However, Donovan thinks they should get Pryor back as well. The CIA only wants Powers back, but Donovan plans to make a negotiation regardless. He travels to East Germany to meet with Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch), a German lawyer who can broker a deal. Donovan meets three people posing as Abel's family before meeting Vogel. Donovan sees through the ruse, however.During his time in East Germany, Donovan is forced to stay in a cold and crummy hotel room. As he passes by the wall on the train, he sees several East Germans trying to climb over the wall to escape, but they are shot down by guards. The sight of this horrifies Donovan.The East German government refuses to give up Pryor after learning that the USSR was involved in the negotiation. While the CIA thinks they should leave Pryor, Donovan makes a bold move by threatening the East German government. If Pryor is not released to them, the whole deal is off, and Abel would be interrogated, leaving bad blood between Germany and the USSR.The men on both sides meet on the Glienicke Bridge. Powers's buddy Joe Murphy (Jesse Plemons) is brought over to confirm that it is definitely Powers on the other side. Meanwhile at Checkpoint Charlie, Pryor is brought over. After he is confirmed, the exchange is made, and Abel crosses over to the other side, but not before letting Donovan know that he left him a gift. The two men share one final look before departing the bridge. On the plane ride, Powers tells Donovan that he never told his captors anything, to which Donovan states that none of it matters anymore. He then opens the gift from Abel, which is a painting of Donovan himself.Donovan returns home to his family. The kids see the news story on the exchange and are shocked to hear their dad's name mentioned, thinking he was away on a fishing trip. Mary then walks into the bedroom to find her husband lying there, resting comfortably at last.Donovan rides the train where he sees people are now reading positive headlines. The lady who stared at him earlier now looks at him with a smile. As he looks out the window, he sees children climbing over a fence, reminding him of what he saw in Germany.The ending text states that Rudolf Abel returned home and was never acknowledged as a spy. Francis Gary Powers died when his plane crashed in 1977. Frederic Pryor went on to become a professor at Swarthmore College. James B. Donovan was asked by President Kennedy to negotiate the release of 1,000 Cuban exile prisoners from Cuba after the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. He would eventually get over 9,000 men, women, and children released."

He learns what they're trying to steal and plans to stop them while also rescuing Maya and Lane. He gathers all the non-lethal equipment and takes out most of the goons. Meanwhile, Maya escapes the room she's in using the copper wire in a snow globe that Lane gave her to unlock the door. They have to go back to the room since the goons are too close. One goon offers Vincent an oatmeal cookie, but he rejects it since he is terribly allergic.After taking out one goon carrying a Van Gogh painting, Paul contacts Vincent and tells him they'll trade the painting for Maya. Vincent drags Maya out after hearing her tell Lane about Paul's fear of being alone after being divorced, losing his mother, and now having his daughter go away to college. Vincent uses this against Paul, but it doesn't faze him as he got Donna, Saul, Khan, and Gino to join forces with him. They square off against all of Vincent's henchmen as he takes Maya and Lane to the helipad to get away. The security guards clumsily but successfully take out the villains.Paul gets to the rooftop to see Vincent has taken Maya and Lane to the roof of another building. Eduardo goes up to find Paul. Paul thinks he is in on the scheme, but Eduardo is just mad that Paul has attracted Divina's attention. They settle their differences and, with the help of the other guards, including a now sober Manero, Paul uses a zipline to get to the other building and stop Vincent. He uses a gun with some sticky material to take out the remaining henchmen, but he accidentally gets his own feet stuck. Vincent is about to shoot Paul when Maya gets oatmeal lotion and rubs it all over Vincent's face, causing him to go blind and to swell out. Paul jumps out of his shoes and headbutts Vincent, knocking him out cold.The villains are arrested and the artwork is returned safely. Paul makes peace with Eduardo and talks to Divina, who admits her attraction to Paul, but he feels that she must stay with Eduardo (especially since he's crying). She agrees, though Paul immediately realizes he just made a huge mistake. Later, the security guards honor Paul with a medal of valor. Finally, Paul decides that he must let Maya go and supports her choice to go to UCLA.Months later, Paul drops Maya off at the UCLA campus with her new friends. Paul walks back to his car when he spots a policewoman riding a horse downtown. He tries to coolly walk over to her, but she starts to write him a ticket for jaywalking in a business district. He mentions that he's an officer, and the woman instead decides to give him her number. Paul then proudly smacks the horse on the rear, causing it to kick him against his car. The policewoman asks Paul if he's okay. He says he's never been better."
The Big Short,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 2006-2007 a group of investors bet against the United States mortgage market. In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is. Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old ""friend"", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.—Huggo Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, among others), the true story of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst.—grantss In 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett, hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.—Jwelch5742 2008. Sensing the imminent danger of a financial crisis based on inconspicuous warning signs in the mortgage-backed real estate market, a motley crew of bold and shrewd investors reap immense profits by betting against the housing market. But who could have predicted that a real-estate bubble of such magnitude was about to burst? No one could have foreseen the catastrophic impact of an economy in shambles that renders millions jobless and homeless.—Nick Riganas Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) states to the viewers that the world of banking is extremely boring. Things changed when Lewis Ranieri (Rudy Eisenzopf) created a plan for mortgage-backed securities to ensure bigger profits with lower risks since everyone was paying their mortgages. This was big for bankers, up until the year 2008 when the global financial crisis hit. Vennett adds that a small group of individuals saw this coming.The next scene shows hedge fund millionaire Michael Burry (Christian Bale) in his office conducting an interview with a young analyst. Burry says his wife told him he needs to ""share more"". He discusses having a glass eye since childhood due to losing his real eye to an illness. We see him as a child playing in a football game and being ashamed when the eye falls out. Burry continues rambling on about how the tech bubble burst in 2001, yet the housing market went up. He hires the analyst on the spot and instructs him to get him a list of the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.The scene shifts to a counseling session where Mark Baum (Steve Carell) enters and takes over the session by complaining to everyone about an encounter he just had with a retail banker regarding his bank's overdraft policies and how he is screwing over working people. Baum despises people working in big banks, especially after his brother committed suicide after getting screwed over. He later calls his wife Cynthia (Marisa Tomei) to express his anger, which she is used to hearing about, but still thinks he should quit his job. Baum then takes a cab from another man.Burry does his homework and reviews the list he asked for. He discovers that the housing market is being backed by subprime loans in which clients are providing fewer returns, and then decides he can bet against the housing market and profit off of it. To properly explain what a subprime loan is, Vennett (still narrating) directs us to a woman (Margot Robbie) taking a bubble bath and drinking champagne to explain that ""subprime"" means ""shit"", and that the banks created them to add more mortgages to their plans. Burry then goes to multiple banks, starting with Goldman Sachs, to express the idea that the bonds will fail and to create a credit default swap market. Thinking the bonds are secure, the bankers roll with his bet. Burry's boss Lawrence Fields (Tracy Letts) is distressed by his plan for fear of what it'll do to their own business.Vennett learns of Burry's dealings and then meets with Baum and his team of investors - Danny Moses (Rafe Spall), Porter Collins (Hamish Linklater), and Vinnie Daniel (Jeremy Strong) - to propose to them the idea of the credit default swap. He explains that all the bad bonds can be put together into CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations). Vennett brings us to Anthony Bourdain to explain CDOs by comparing it to making a seafood stew from a bunch of fish that didn't sell too well. After Vennett leaves, Baum and his team consider taking his words seriously.We meet young hopeful investors Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) waiting to meet with someone from JP Morgan Chase. However, they don't get far without having an ISDA agreement. Discouraged, they then find a pitch from Vennett on how the housing market is a bubble (which Shipley states isn't a completely accurate depiction of how they found out about it). They decide to jump on the credit default swap bandwagon and bring in retired trader Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to help them since they are too inexperienced to pull off the trades they need in order to profit from this.Moses and Collins go to a neighborhood to find foreclosed houses. They encounter a renter that worries about being evicted with his son. Moses and Collins enter a home with a past due notice paper in the kitchen, and then a home with an alligator in the pool.Burry is confronted by Fields for his betting, thinking that his plan will fail within six years. He and another investor demand their money back, but Burry refuses to give in.Baum and his team dig further into the housing market, meeting with a real estate agent, two mortgage brokers, and even a stripper to learn about what sort of loans are given to particular customers, leading Baum to realize that the market is indeed a bubble.By early 2007, it is reported that mortgage delinquencies have reached a new high. Baum and his team are told to give up their swaps by risk assessors. Baum has Daniel tell them to fuck off. The two meet with Georgia Hale (Melissa Leo), an officer for Standard and Poor's, and grill her over giving banks AAA percentages on subprime loans. She defends herself by saying the banks would default if they didn't get those ratings, and Baum criticizes her actions, but she fires back by noting that he and his team own multiple credit default swaps.Vennett tells Baum and his team to pull out of their trades, as Geller tells Shipley the same thing, due to mortgage defaults going up. Shipley and the team both express their respective negative views. Rickert tells the guys, as Vennett tells his guys, to go to Las Vegas to attend the American Securitization Forum.Both groups go to Vegas for the Forum. Baum spends his time grilling the big-wigs for their dealings. Shipley meets with a girl he knows named Evie (Karen Gillan), who works for the SEC, and asks her if the SEC investigates mortgage bonds, to which she says no.Burry becomes increasingly morose as he continues to learn that bonds aren't going down and that the whole system is fraudulent.Geller, Shipley, and Rickert then plan to short AA tranches. They make many deals with many bankers, but as Geller and Shipley celebrate, Rickert reminds them that eventually, the market will collapse and millions of people will be hurt from it. The realization hits the two deeply.Baum meets a businessman named Mr. Chau (Byron Mann) in a casino and learns that he has created synthetic CDOs, which is a series of bigger and bigger bets on faulty loans. Baum slowly but surely realizes the economy is going to collapse. We then get Richard Thaler and Selena Gomez to explain what a synthetic CDO is by comparing it to people making bets on Selena winning at blackjack because her odds are looking good, until she deals a bad hand, and everyone loses.By April 2007, everyone is preparing for the inevitable. Burry prevents investors from withdrawing their money. Geller and Shipley go around to the press and the like to warn then about the collapse, but no one is interested in pursuing the story. Baum and his team are told to give up or sell their swaps.As predicted, by the end of 2008, the market economy has collapsed, but all those involved in the shorts have profited immensely from the swaps, although none of them are proud of it. Several banks begin shutting down. Burry retires, and one of his analysts takes a new job at a 7-11. The man that Moses and Collins visited earlier is now living out of a van with his wife and son. Geller and Shipley have lost faith in the system. Baum mentions a bailout happening, which Vennett states is true, and that the banks saved their skins and blamed the bad things on immigrants, the poor, and even teachers. Daniel then tells Baum that they should sell their swaps, but Baum thinks it'll make them as bad as the banks, though Daniel says otherwise. Baum then tells him to sell them all.The final text reads that five trillion dollars from real estate values, pension funds, 401k, savings, and bonds had disappeared after the collapse. 8 million people lost their jobs, 6 million lost their homes, and that was only in the U.S. Mark Baum refused to say ""I told you so"", and his team continues to run their fund together. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley attempted to sue ratings agencies but were laughed out of the offices. Shipley still runs Brownfield but Geller moved to Charlotte to start a family. Ben Rickert lives with his wife on an orchard. Michael Burry contacted the government several times to see if anyone would ask him how he predicted the collapse. Nobody responded, but he was audited four times by the FBI. He now only invests in water. In the present day 2015, several large banks, who in their corporate greed had apparently learned nothing, began selling billions in CDOs."
War Room,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3832914/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A seemingly perfect family looks to fix their problems with the help of Miss Clara, an older, wiser woman. Filled with heart, humor, and wit, WAR ROOM follows Tony and Elizabeth Jordan, a couple who seemingly have it all-great jobs, a beautiful daughter, their dream home. But appearances can be deceiving. In reality, their marriage has become a war zone and their daughter is collateral damage. With guidance from Miss Clara, an older, wiser woman, Elizabeth discovers she can start fighting for her family instead of against them. As the power of prayer and Elizabeth's newly energized faith transform her life, will Tony join the fight and become the man he knows he needs to be? Together, their real enemy doesn't have a prayer.—AFFIRM/Provident With great jobs, a beautiful daughter (Alena Pitts) and a dream house, the Jordans seem to have it all.

Their lives take an unexpected turn for the better when Elizabeth meets her newest client, Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie), who encourages the couple to find happiness through prayer. Ms. Clara (Karen Abercrombie) is standing by a grave. The scene cuts to army soldiers standing in a war room. Clara explains a war room is where an army gathers before a war to plan their strategy. This is what her husband did for a living until a heart attack took his life too soon.We meet the Jordan family. Tony (T.C. Stallings), the father, is very emotionally cold. He comes home and yells at his wife, Elizabeth (Priscilla C. Shirer). Tony is angry because he just found out that she transferred $5,000 from their savings account and knew it is for her poverty-stricken sister. He tells her to put it back, and its his decision to handle their money and she wont be giving her sister any money. Tony tells their young daughter, Danielle (Alenna Pitts), that she is too old for a double dutch team. Liz nods disapprovingly. She tells Danielle she has to drop her off at the community center early the next day to meet with a client and Tony is leaving for a business trip.We see that Tony is the top salesman at a pharmaceutical company. He makes a lot of money and is well respected. On his way out of a meeting, he meets an attractive lady who hands him her phone number. He takes it and smiles.Liz works as a real estate agent. We see her in a meeting room with her co-workers, and they tell her not to back down to Tony and to give her sister the money anyway. Then one lady makes a joke and says ""My grandmother used to say, submitting to your husband is just ducking so God can hit your husband.""Liz goes to meet Ms. Clara. She gets the details of her beautiful home. She sees a picture on the wall of Clara and her husband. She says they only had one son and were married for only 14 years before he died. Then Clara asks to meet Liz the next day for coffee. Liz agrees.The next morning Clara asks Liz about her church and her prayer life. Liz says she goes to church sometimes and that shed consider her prayer life lukewarm. Clara brings Liz room temperature coffee, and when she expresses her disgust, Clara tells her thats how God feels about His people being lukewarm. ""He wants us either hot or cold"" says Ms. Clara. Meanwhile, Tony calls the woman from earlier and say hell be in town and asks her out to dinner.Clara asks Liz if shell meet with her one hour a week, and shell train her about how to pray for her husband so Liz wont step on the same land mines that Clara did. Liz agrees. Clara tells her that God calls us to pray, not to change people and that her battle isnt with Tony, but its with the devil who has taken control of her house and her marriage. She shows her a closet, which Clara calls her ""war room"", where she goes to pray. She has scriptures and notes posted on the walls of the room about what to pray for what situation and what she needs to pray for. Outside of the closet, she has a wall of remembrance, where she posts answered prayers.At home, Liz overhears her daughter Danielle tell her friend that she wishes she could live at her house because anytime her parents are together, all they do is fight. Liz goes to her closet and cleans it out and makes her war room. She isnt sure what to do at first. (In a hilarious scene, Liz is shown taking chairs and bean bags in and out deciding what to do.) Then she decides just to sit and eat chips until Danielle finds her. Danielle makes a joke about how stinky the closet is because of her mother's feet.Liz gets a text from a friend that Tony is at dinner with another woman, and it doesnt look like business. Liz begins to cry. Then she sits down in her war room and genuinely prays. She finds scriptures to help her trust God and resist the devil. She prays to God to take her hurt and intervene in the situation with Tony, to please help him and stop whatever is happening and save her marriage.Meanwhile, Tony is at dinner with the woman. She doesnt care that hes married and invites him back to her apartment to spend the night. Tony agrees and asks for the check. Meanwhile, Liz is still praying that God stops the situation. At the same time, Tony suddenly gets very sick and runs to the bathroom.Tony comes home early and finds Liz making dinner. She says Danielle is going to a friends house. He asks if she can eat with her. She smiles and agrees, never mentioning the affair. He sees her cell phone and the messages from the friend telling her about him with the other woman, so he knows that she knows where he was. Liz treats him with dignity and respect, never questioning him because shes trusting it to God. She says God is his judge, not her. In another funny scene, he switches their plates of food because of how nice and calm she is. He asks her what she wants. She says ""Right now? Right now... Id like a big ice cream sundae. Hot fudge just everywhere and lots of whipped cream. One cherry right on top. OH and a foot rub"". Tony says ""Liz, I am NOT touching your feet.""Liz continues to meet with Clara. They go for ice cream and are robbed at knife point. Clara stands up to the man and tells him to drop the knife in the name of Jesus.

When he tells Liz that he was just fired, hes already very defensive. Shes very calm and says that its okay, and theyll make it through this.

He reads the prayers and the letters she has. He takes Danielle to her double dutch practice and gets involved. He jumps with her and teaches her new tricks. Her and her friends love him. Tony goes home and falls on his face and begs God to forgive him. Then he goes to Liz and begs her forgiveness and says he will be better. He says he didnt cheat on her, but he almost did; he came so close, and hes so sorry for all hes done and how he has treated her. She forgives him. Then he asks the same from his daughter.Tony tells Liz hes struggling with one more thing. He opens a box full of pills he stole from the pharmaceutical company. He says he knows he has to return them but if he does, he may spend time in jail. She tells him to trust God. Tony takes the pills back to the company. One boss, Tom, is ready to call the cops immediately, but another boss (played by writer and director Alex Kendrick), tells him to give him two days to think about what he wants to do.Liz tells Tony to spend the next two days involved with the jump rope team and to let God have his worries. He does. The day before he finds out his fate, his boss comes to his house. He tells him that he cant give him his job back but that he believes he is sincere because not many men would risk returning the pills. He also tells him he needs to pay back the company $19,000 in bonuses because of his lies. He says they already agreed to do so.Liz and Tony break down saying this is grace and mercy from God on them.The next day the family goes to the Double Dutch competition. On the way, they see Tom, the boss who wanted him in prison, with a flat tire. He cant change it, and Tony stops. He gets out of the car and approaches Tom with a tire iron. Tom is visibly scared until Tony goes to the ground to change the tire. He stands up with dirty hands to shake Toms hand, and Tom relaxes and gives him a firm, respectful hand shake. Tom sees that Tony was sincere in his reasoning to get right with God, his family, and his former company. He gets back in the car, and his daughter asks why he did that for such a mean man, and he says ""Its mercy, Danielle. I treated him the way I want to be treated.""At the double dutch competition, Tony competes with his daughters team. They are amazing. Danielle's team wins second place. However, Tony tells Danielle that it wasnt about winning, it was about him being involved and being there for his daughter.They go home as a family. Liz shows Claras house to a retired preacher who says he can tell someone has been praying in that closet; thats how strong she prayed. They buy the house.Liz still meets with Clara and thanks her. She says that Clara was her answered prayer and helped save her family. Clara says that Liz is her answered prayer, too. She tells her that she never got to reconcile with her husband. That she never prayed for him because she was so stubborn, bitter and prideful. She didnt learn her lesson until after he died from a sudden heart attack. She asked God to send her a woman to pass the knowledge on to before it was too late and that God sent her Liz. She asks Liz to please find a woman to do the same for.Liz and Tony are at home, and he asks her how it went with her sister. She said it went fine, and she appreciated the $500 and knows they cant do more right now. He tells her he got a job as head of the community center, its half the pay, but theyll make it if theyre wise. She says shes so wise the ladies skipped dessert. He says good, he has something for her.She sits on the couch, and he brings a bucket of water to her. He tells her to put her feet in and relax then brings her her ice cream sundae just the way she described earlier.Liz tells him please, dont touch her stinky feet.

Becca mentions that she agreed to the trip because their mom hasn't been able to connect with her new boyfriend, and a five-day cruise might help them get closer, (as in getting laid and having steamy, passionate, wild sex day in and day out!!).They get to Pennsylvania where their grandparents live, and they're waiting for them as they get off the train. The grandparents, John ""Pop-Pop"" (Peter McRobbie) and Doris ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan), seem friendly enough and take them back to their house. Tyler does a freestyle rap using Nana's suggestion of pineapple upside down cake. Becca discusses her documentary and her love of making movies.Tyler and Becca get settled into their room upstairs, which used to be their mother's. They play rock, paper, scissors to see who gets the bed and who gets the sofa, and Becca gets the bed. She tells Tyler about the old time song she's going to play over some of the footage when there's a happy conclusion to the week. She gives Tyler a second camera so he can film additional footage.Tyler films Pop-Pop mysteriously working in the shed. He calls out to him and Pop-Pop sees him but doesn't respond.Tyler coerces Becca to play Hide and Seek underneath the house. They crawl around, and then suddenly Nana is down on all fours behind Tyler. She races after him, and then Becca, each scurrying to get away from her as she seems demented and off, repeating ""I'm going to get you"" as she scurries after the kids. They escape from underneath the house, and Nana laughs, her hands sullied, seemingly aware of the game and simply trying to participate. She walks away, revealing the roughhousing has caused her dress to ride upwards, exposing her bare butt.A man comes to the door and asks to talk to their grandparents. They tell him they're not there. He says he knows them from Meadow Shade, the hospital they volunteer at a few days a week, and he has some gossip to tell them about the latest drama going on down there.Tyler decides he's going to investigate what's in the shed. He sneaks inside and says it ""smells like ass"". He finds in the corner a pile. He gets closer to see what it is and discovers it's used adult diapers. He runs out screaming. Inside, Nana explains to him that Pop-Pop is incontinent, and a lot of adults have to wear diapers. He hides them in the shed because he's ashamed, then he burns them. She then continues giving Becca tips on how to make cookies.That night, Pop-Pop comes into their room and tells them that there is mold in the basement, and they should not go down there. He also tells them that everyone follows the same schedule, so lights have to be out at 9:30. They agree but are annoyed, especially since there is no WiFi, and they can't use any electronics. Tyler decides to start using pop stars names instead of swearing in his raps and says if he stubs his toe, it sounds cooler to shout out ""Shakira!"" than a cuss word (This is a motif that is carried out throughout the movie with him shouting out Sarah McLachlan and Katy Perry in times of annoyance or danger). The two can't sleep, and it's now 10:23 PM. Becca says she's going to sneak out to get one of Nana's cookies. She opens the door and sees Nana walking in the dark, projectile vomiting. She quickly shuts the door.TUESDAY MORNINGThe next morning, Pop-Pop and Nana are outside with breakfast on the table. Nana apologizes because shes got hot oil all over Becca's computer but really only the webcam. Becca says she will probably be able to scrub it off with enough effort. The kids later ask Pop-Pop if Nana is sick. They are told Nana experiences something called ""sundowning"", which is a form of dementia that happens when the sun sets. It's the equivalent of talking in one's sleep and not to be concerned, but it's best for them to stay in their room during the night. He says Nana is convinced there are bad things inside her, so she throws up to get rid of them. As he's explaining this, he's putting on a tuxedo. They ask him if he's going somewhere, and he tells them there's a costume ball at the train station he's late for. He then realizes that he's confused and takes the tuxedo off.Pop-Pop takes Becca and Tyler through the town. They play a game where they make up stories about people who live in the buildings including the closed police station. When they try to make up a story about a tall building, Pop-Pop tells them its Meadow Shade where they volunteer, and he'll show it to them when he gets his Meadow Shade badge from home. They go to the park to play, but Pop-Pop tells them they have to leave because they're being followed. The kids see a man across the street using his cell phone, not paying attention to the three of them. Pop-Pop runs over and begins to assault the man, yelling at him. Becca and Tyler convince him to leave the man alone, and Pop-Pop apologizes to them.Back home, Becca is in the kitchen with Nana. She asks her if she can interview her, but Nana does not want to be on camera. Instead, she asks for Becca's help cleaning the oven. Becca cleans with just her arm, but Nana tells her to lean into it. Nana then convinces her to get completely inside. While she's fully submerged in the oven, Nana bounces up and down excitedly. Becca reappears, and Nana tells her she is ready to be in her movie.Becca interviews Nana by asking her warm-up questions. When she asks Nana what happened 15 years ago to cause her not to speak to her daughter, Nana starts going berserk, shaking violently, and screams that she no longer wants to be in Becca's movie.Outside, Tyler interviews Becca asking what animal shed want to be (a dolphin), then why she likes the pizza guy despite him having bad acne (he has kind eyes.) Then he asks her why she can't look at herself in the mirror, pointing out when she brushes her hair, she does it with her back to the mirror. And when she brushes her teeth, she looks down. She hints that it's because their dad abandoned the three of them years ago, and she has felt rejected. Tyler defends his dad, saying there was a time when he was eight when he was playing peewee football. His team was up by three, and it was the fourth quarter and they were set to win as long as nobody scored in the final minutes. A big kid came running towards him but instead of blocking him, he just froze. Everyone started screaming at him but he was completely frozen, immobile, which is what happens when he's afraid. But his dad never judged him for it. But he sometimes blames that for being why his dad went away.In the editing software, she's piecing together on her computer, Becca films herself in front of an obstructed slideshow of pictures of her brother, her, and their father. She says that while she's trying to tell the story of her mom's parents, she will not be including anybody from the past that she doesn't consider worthy of acknowledgment.That night, at 10:47 PM, they hear a scary sound coming outside their locked door. The two want to film what's on the other side, so Tyler tells Becca to open the door. She refuses. He then says if she holds the camera, hell open the door. He does, and they reveal a naked Nana clawing at the door opposite them, scratching like a frantic dog. He shuts the door and declares that he's now partially blind.WEDNESDAY MORNINGThe next morning, Becca interviews Pop-Pop, and he tells her how he used to have a great job, but he used to see a white figure with yellow eyes at his job. Nobody else could see it, but he was insistent it was there. So he was eventually fired. He warns Becca that she, too, will see the white figure with yellow eyes one day. She tells him he seems sad.Tyler tries to convince Becca to set the camera up in the living room so it can film what happens at night. She says she can't film their grandparents unless one of them is there otherwise it's unethical. She explains they're both experiencing signs of early onset schizophrenia.A neighbor named Stacey comes over, telling them their grandparents volunteered at the hospital when she was in rehab, and she baked treats to thank them.The kids get an Ethernet cord and now talk to their mom on Skype. Tyler tells her Nana is acting weird. The mom tells them ""they're old, and that's just how old people act"". Becca defends them and says they are weird but nice. Tyler and Becca both agree that this is a 1 on the scale of problems. Their mom comments how she wishes she could see them (but can't because their webcam is blocked from Nana's mishap in the kitchen). Their mom leaves to watch her boyfriend in a Hairy Chest contest on the cruise ship.That night, at 10:16 PM, they hear an odd commotion outside the door. They want to know what Nana is doing this time but are too scared to look. Becca decides just to open the door and film for a short while, for the documentary sake. When she opens the door, they see Nana running past, with both arms behind her back, rushing past them, in both directions. Just as she's about to crawl towards the camera, they shut and lock the door.THURSDAY MORNINGThe next morning, the four of them go out into the woods. Becca says she doesn't want to leave without getting an elixir for Mom. While the grandparents are ahead on the trail, Tyler begins to mimic Nana's running with her arms behind the back only to get caught by Nana, who tells them they're going to miss the family of foxes. They turn the corner and see Nana staring into a well. They ask her what she's looking at, but Pop-Pop tells them it's nothing.Tyler and Becca return to the well later to try to figure out what is hidden inside. But all they pull up is water.Becca goes in the shed and finds Pop-Pop with a rifle in his mouth. He declares he's just cleaning it and then mimics cleaning it.Later that evening, Becca is in the living room and hears Nana laughing hysterically. She decides to show what kind of television show makes her Nana laugh, hoping it's the same one her mom loves. But she finds Nana rocking in a chair, facing the wall. She asks Nana what she's laughing about and is told the naughty spirits are inside her, and she laughs to keep them at bay. She then tells her a story about how there are people in the water that were stolen by people from another planet. These people will later be collected and sent back to this planet but for now, they're at the bottom of water. Becca tries to interview her again, but she goes crazy when she is asked about the night that caused them to become estranged. When Becca presents it as a story about a girl who fell in love with an older man, whose family did not approve, and what she would say to the girl, Nana tells her I would tell the girl ""I'm sorry.""Becca now has her elixir, an apology from Nana. Outside the window, they see Nana and Pop-Pop in a heated argument with their neighbor, Stacey. They wonder what they are fighting about.Becca decides Tyler is right and that they should set up the camera in the living room to see exactly what goes on at night. Becca also wonders what's in the basement given that they were told not to go down there.At night, Tyler is freaking out because he touched something slimy on the toilet handle and can feel it seeping into his skin. Becca gets tissues and helps wipe it off. Time passes, and they fall asleep. In the living area, Nana opens and slams the basement door several times. She then rushes around the room, crawling like a dog then appears..... RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HIDDEN CAMERA and screams. She picks up the camera and then films herself going into the kitchen where she grabs a butcher knife. She makes her way up to the kids' bedroom and begins pounding at their door. Becca and Tyler wake up, startled. They can hear Nana trying to get in but just stay still.FRIDAY MORNING:The next morning, they watch the footage and see that Nana was trying to kill them. Becca tells them that their mom is back from her vacation that day so they just have to avoid their grandparents all day until she can come and get them. They throw the ball around and every time the grandparents come by, they tell them ""We're playing. This is how kids play.""Inside, they try to avoid their grandparents by going out to play but Nana asks if Becca can help clean the oven first. Becca leans in, but Nana tells her to go in further. Tyler objects but Nana tells him they've done this before. Becca finally climbs all the way in and Nana pushes her fully inside and shuts the door, telling her she wants to do something real quick and wipes down the handle. Tyler screams at her to open up the oven, and she does. Becca is shaken up, and they quickly go outside and play.They wait until the grandparents are out front and then get on Skype, hoping to sneak in a call without the grandparents being aware. The oil has now been scrubbed off of the webcam so their mom can see them, too. The mom is back home and tries telling them about her vacation and a fight with her boyfriend, but they quickly tell her that she needs to come and pick them up right now. She tells them, ""Do you know how long it'd take to drive from here to there?"" but they tell her to get in the car immediately and make her way to them. They say that their grandparents are scaring them; Nana tried to kill them with a butcher knife, and Pop-Pop put a gun in his mouth and she's afraid he's going to hurt himself.Tyler films the grandparents from the window so his mom can see them. The mom is now white-faced and tells them she has to tell them something and for them to listen. She says: ""THOSE ARE NOT YOUR GRANDPARENTS!!!!"" She asks if they've been staying with them all week and tries to call the local police but gets a recorded message (the station is closed). The mom complains that the hick town has an incompetent police department, and she's going to drive to come get them and will continue to try to call the police on the way. Heading out, she tells them to get somewhere safe but just then the grandparents return, and they shut down Skype. The grandparents suggest having a board game night, but the kids say they want to check something outside while the grandparents figure out the teams. They head for the yard only to see..... STACEY HANGING DEAD FROM A TREE! Nana appears and tells them they already have the teams... Old versus young.The kids are forced to play Yahtzee with the fake grandparents, who eerily pretend everything is normal, Nana complaining how competitive Pop-Pop is. They begin to play the game, but the grandparents are becoming more demented. Pop-Pop begins dressing up for the costume party again. Becca excuses herself from the game saying she's got to film something real quick. Pop-Pop is suspicious and angry. Nana gets excited and starts eating cookies frantically. She turns to the camera Tyler has placed on the table and screams ""YAHTZEE!""Becca goes down to the basement, explaining to the viewer that she thinks her real grandparents have been trapped down there, and that's why Pop-Pop told them to stay away. She begins calling out for the real Nana and Pop-Pop but doesn't hear a response. In the corner, she sees a dumpster and hurries over to it. Inside are family photos of her real grandparents. She also sees something from Meadow Shade which she now learns is a MENTAL HOSPITAL. She digs some more and finds a hammer with blood and white hair on it and then sees..... THE CORPSES OF AN OLD WOMAN AND OLD MAN! Immediately behind her, Pop-Pop has appeared. He explains that he and the woman they know as Nana were mental patients and their real grandparents were volunteers. When they told them about their upcoming visit with their grandchildren, the two imposters decided it would be fun to experience in their place. But he is now determined to kill Becca. He chases Becca up into her room and locks her in. But she manages to defend herself, then busts the lock and escapes.Its past 9:30 PM. Nana is beginning to ""sundown"" and starts crawling around the couches, chasing Becca. Meanwhile, Pop-Pop comes down to the kitchen with Tyler, who is frozen in fear, just like during the peewee game. Pop-Pop tells him he's under a spell and tells Tyler he never liked him. He goes behind the kitchen counter and removes his pants while the frozen Tyler looks on. Simultaneously, Becca continues to be chased by Nana. Becca's hiding in the corner facing the mirror but as normal, she doesn't look at herself, so she's oblivious that Nana's creeping up on her. Nana smashes Becca's face into the mirror and pieces of glass shatter all around them. Becca picks up a shard of glass as Nana jumps on top of her, clawing at her.
'
In the kitchen, Pop-Pop has now revealed that he's removed a dirty diaper. He comments that he's noticed Tyler doesn't like germs and then shoves the dirty adult diaper into Tyler's face.Meanwhile, Nana is on top of Becca, trying to kill her, but Becca stabs Nana to death with the glass shared. In the kitchen, Becca encourages Tyler to snap out of his frozen state, and he does, charging at Pop-Pop again and again and shouting as if he's tackling the big player on the peewee league. He has so much adrenaline that he pummels Pop-Pop to the ground and then smashes the refrigerator door against his head several times (unseen to the audience).The kids run outside to find their mom and police cars out front. They hug their mom as the old time music that Becca promised to play at an important moment in her film plays.Back home, the mom tells Becca that she used to be a great singer, and she could tell her mom was proud of her when she'd sing around the house as a kid. The fight happened because they didn't approve of her husband and when her mom blocked the door to keep her from leaving, she hit her mom and in response, her dad hit her. Stunned by the event, she stormed out and even though her parents tried to reconnect with her, she never talked to them again. She tells Becca not to hold on to anger. In response, we see the slideshow of Becca's dad that she previously said was banned from her documentary, played in full.As the credits roll, we see Becca brushing her hair while looking at herself in the mirror while Tyler performs a rap to camera about the events that took place over those five days, including getting a used adult diaper shoved in his face and how it took two bars of soap to feel clean again. He says it did not taste like chicken."
The Wedding Ringer,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884732/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two weeks shy of his wedding, a socially awkward guy enters into a charade by hiring the owner of a company that provides best men for grooms in need. Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is a lovable but socially awkward groom-to-be with a problem: he has no best man. With less than two weeks to go until he marries the girl of his dreams (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), Doug is referred to Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart), owner and CEO of Best Man, Inc., a company that provides flattering best men for socially challenged guys in need. What ensues is a hilarious wedding charade as they try to pull off the big con, and an unexpected budding bromance between Doug and his fake best man Jimmy.—Sony Pictures Entertainment Elated to finally have found a bride in bossy Gretchen Palmer, goofy nerd Doug Harris, who never had a proper adult social life, got caught in his own lies about suitable friends as best man and seven groomsmen with unfortunately detailed characteristics. Doug's gay Mexican wedding planner, who fears a no-show in a few weeks, discretely refers him to Best Man, Inc., the private agency of slick bachelor Jimmy Callahan, who helps men trough daunting weddings for a living, yet considers this case an unprecedented-daunting 'golden tuxedo'. Still, paranymphs are recruited and like the groom trained intensively for their parts. Doug and Jimmy, whose character is army chaplain Bic, meet the Palmer future in-laws, and are dares to an American football match which proves less then friendly, in fact as painful as masked-abducted Doug's wild bachelor party, yet some bromance also blossoms. Still, hearing the unromantic truth from the bride's mouth on wedding day proves the crucial obstacle.—KGF Vissers Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is a nice guy with a high-powered job and a gorgeous fiancee, but with only one week to go before his big wedding to his dream girl Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), he has yet to find his best man. Cue Jimmy Callahan (Hart) the owner of Best Man Inc., which provides a rather unique service for men who need to juice up their weddings: For a fee, Jimmy will be your best man -- and not just any best man, but one whom your guests will be talking about for years to come.. With ten days until his wedding to Gretchen Palmer, the type of woman he thought he could never get in she being proverbially way out of his league, successful accountant Doug Harris has finally admitted to himself that he not only doesn't have friends to fill the seven groomsmen's spots to match Gretchen's seven bridesmaids, but that none of his current or former acquaintances feels comfortable enough to accept the role of best man in he having no true friends. Beyond the under pressure story he came up with of the best man being someone named Bic Mitchum, an army priest currently serving in El Salvador, Doug doesn't want to tell Gretchen about this issue in wanting the wedding to go perfectly for her. Seeing what is happening with Doug and knowing that this problem will throw a wrench into his vision for the wedding, Edmundo, their stereotypically effeminate wedding planner, points Doug in the direction of the figurative and literal underground business, The Best Man Inc., operated by Jimmy Callahan, his service to act as a best man at weddings for such friendless men like Doug, complete with a ""best buds"" back story. No matter what package any of his clients purchase, the one thing that Jimmy is up front to them about is that their relationship is solely business, any pretense of friendship just that: pretend. Doug feels that he has to go off the list of services Jimmy offers for what Jimmy refers to as ""the golden tux"" package - price tag: $50,000 - as it entails something more elaborate than Jimmy has ever perpetrated, especially in finding seven groomsmen, the nine of them who have to show Gretchen and the world that they indeed have long been the closest of friends. Beyond anything that may expose their ruse, especially to Gretchen, complications ensue when Doug, for the first time in his life, has a group of men he truly considers his friends, even if he had to pay $50,000 for their services. The question then becomes if Jimmy feels the same way, he never having gone to this extent in his services and thus never having gotten to know a client more so than Doug.—Huggo Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart) provides best man services for guys who don't have the friends necessary for a wedding. As Doug Harris (Josh Gad), a successful tax attorney, and his fiancee Gretchen Palmer (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) are planning for their wedding day, Doug becomes frantic searching for a best man. He faints and is referred to Jimmy's company, The Best Man Inc., by his party planner, Edmundo (Ignacio Serricchio).Doug is sent to The Best Man Inc., by Otis (Corey Holcomb), which is located under an amusement park. Doug meets Jimmy and asks him to pull off a ""Golden Tux"" (seven groomsmen) to match with Gretchen's bridesmaids, which has never been done before. Jimmy refuses, claiming he is complacent and doesn't need the pressure. After hearing Doug's plea, Jimmy agrees to be his best man along with a payment of $50,000 and all expenses paid. When going over the formalities for the wedding, Doug tells Jimmy his name is Bic Mitchum.Jimmy recruits some former friends. Fitzgibbons (Colin Kane), a criminal who escaped from a federal prison, agrees to be a groomsman because there will be seven bridesmaids to hit on. Next, he recruits Lurch (Jorge Garcia), a plumber, who agrees to get away from his nagging wife. Lastly, he recruits Reggie (Affion Crockett), an airline security agent, who agrees because there will be good food. Jimmy, his secretary Doris (Jenifer Lewis), Fitzgibbons, Lurch, and Reggie interview people willing to fill the four remaining spots based on their ""party trick distractions."" They choose Kip (Alan Ritchson), a sexy man with a stutter, Endo (Aaron Takahashi), who has three testicles, Bronstein (Dan Gill), who can dislocate and relocate his shoulder, and Otis, who can say every sentence backwards.Doug, excited, tells Gretchen that ""Bic"" flew in from El Salvador, and he will be at the wedding. He also presents to her two honeymoon tickets to Tahiti. Gretchen insists that Bic comes to the family brunch. Doug meets Jimmy and they memorize their identities. Doug also tells Jimmy that he must act as a military priest from North Dakota.At the brunch Gretchen's father Ed (Ken Howard) asks Jimmy what part of North Dakota he's from. Doug becomes nervous and almost blows his own cover until Jimmy accidentally sets Grandma (Cloris Leachman) on fire. They take her to the emergency room, and Jimmy makes up a lie to Ed that Doug used to play football. Ed challenges Jimmy and Doug to a football game with some of his old college teammates who will be at the wedding.Doug meets his groomsmen, who he is initially not fond of. Doris gives all of them fake identities, all of which share the last names of famous Los Angeles sports figures (Plunkett, Rambis, Garvey, Alzado, Drysdale, Carew, and Dickerson) which they have to memorize. Jimmy takes the groomsmen on fake photo shoots of skydiving, scuba-diving, bowling, running a marathon, and climbing mountains. As Jimmy realizes Doug is beginning to doubt him, he is taken to Edmundo's house. Doug learns Edmundo's flamboyant personality is just a ruse for better business. Edmundo tells him that the only key is to please Gretchen and her mother Lois (Mimi Rogers) and nothing else matters. To prove to Doug how good he is at being a best man, Jimmy takes Doug to a wedding where the best man (Josh Peck) makes a terrible speech. After, they have drinks and show off their dance moves. The two drink after the wedding and talk. Jimmy said he made an excellent best man speech for a minor friend which led to his career as a wedding ringer. Doug said that his father was an international tax attorney and moved frequently as a child, so he never got to make friends. He also tells Jimmy he's never been on a ""guy trip"" and just wants a friend to ""sit down and have a beer with."" When his parents died, Doug took over the business, and work consumed him, leaving him without a best man. Jimmy drives Doug home, and reiterates that they are in a business relationship, and Doug, although hurt, agrees.Jimmy, thinking about what Doug said, is reminded by Doris why he started his business in the first place. She tells Jimmy he needs a real friend for himself, and he is motivated to pull off the rest of the wedding.The next day, Doug is captured by Reggie and Fitzgibbons and taken to his outrageous bachelor party. He is introduced to Nadia (Nicky Whelan), who tries to seduce him. Doug instead befriends her and she later puts peanut butter on his genitals. Doug, who is blindfolded, is unaware that Jimmy and Nadia have a basset hound to lick off the peanut butter. When the prank goes awry, the groomsmen and Nadia race to the hospital and evade a cop chase. When Doug wakes up the next day, Nadia kisses him goodbye, and hints she would like to know him better. Later, the groomsmen play football with Ed and his college football friends, including Joe Namath, John Riggins, and Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones. A mud bowl ensues and Ed blows out his knee on the last play.At the rehearsal dinner that night, Gretchen's bridesmaids sing a song, while Doug's groomsmen create a slideshow of the fake pictures they previously took, winning Gretchen over. That night, Gretchen, speaking to Doug, notices Bic razors and Mitchum deodarant in their cabinets. She recognizes the familiarity in the last names of the groomsmen and deduces the scheme. She asks Doug about it but he brushes it off, saying Gretchen is paranoid, to which she reluctantly agrees.On the day of the wedding, the family priest cancels and is replaced by Jimmy's old Catholic school principal. Doug hatches an idea where Reggie and Fitzgibbons kidnap the priest and Jimmy officiates the wedding as Bic Mitchum. The wedding reception is initially successful. Jimmy passes Gretchen and congratulates her on the wedding. Gretchen exclaims that the wedding is a disaster because her grandmother has third degree burns, her dad's knee is blown out, the food is bad, the bridesmaids are not attracted to the groomsmen, the zipper on her dress is broken, and she isn't marrying the man she loves. Gretchen confesses to Jimmy she only married Doug because she was tired of having bad relationships and he can easily provide the lavish lifestyle she wants. Doug overhears this in the bathroom and tells Jimmy that he can't go through with the rest of the wedding. Jimmy dismisses Doug's ideas and makes the best man speech. Before Jimmy wraps up his best man speech, Doug stops it and reveals he and Gretchen aren't married since ""Bic"" is not a real priest. He also tells everyone that his groomsmen are fake. Jimmy, Doug, and the groomsmen try to escape. Before doing so, Jimmy asks Gretchen's sister, Allison (Olivia Thirlby) on a date, which she accepts. Doug pays Jimmy his $50,000 like he promised and they accept each other's friendship. As they leave, Jimmy has an idea.They use Doug's first class honeymoon tickets to Tahiti, taking him on a guy trip where the groomsmen, Edmundo, Doris, and Nadia, who begins her romance with Doug, party in the plane, while Lurch says that he ""has a bad feeling about this flight.""In a scene at the end of the credits, Jimmy and Doug are seen playing a painful game of tennis."
Black Mass,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355683/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf. In late-1970s Boston, the FBI are looking to break the Mafia's hold on the north of the city. Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) is on the case and willing to go to any lengths to achieve his aims. A South Boston native, he decides to ""ally"" the FBI with South Boston crime kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), as his main enemies are the Mafia. Approaching Bulger via his brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), a Massachusetts State Senator, Connolly is successful in gaining Bulger as an informant and ally against the Mafia. However, this alliance only emboldens Bulger in his quest for power and wealth, as he is able to operate with impunity and utter ruthlessness. Not realizing he is being duped, Connolly finds himself backing Bulger rather than law, order, and justice.—grantss In the 1970s, Irish criminal James ""Whitey"" Bulger is the leader of the Winter Hill Gang in South Boston after imprisonments for many years. His brother William ""Billy"" Bulger is a Massachusetts Senator. When ambitious FBI agent John Connolly is assigned to investigate the Boston Mafia, he proposes a deal to Whitey, his childhood friend, to become an FBI informant; in return, the FBI would neglect any investigation of his gang. They take down the Italian mob with Whitey's information while Whitey becomes one of the most powerful and notorious gangsters in South Boston. But when the prosecutor Fred Wyshak is assigned to Boston, he demands investigation of Whitey despite the interference of Connolly and Whitey becomes one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A partial account of the life ofJames 'Whitey' Bulgeris presented. This phase of his story begins in 1975 when his gangster activities are largely confined to the South Boston neighborhood where he grew up, there where his group, the Winter Hill Gang, are the kingpins of such criminal activity. John Connolly, an FBI agent recently returned to Boston and a childhood friend of Whitey's state-senator brother Billy Bulger, approaches Whitey with a proposal: to act as his snitch against other Boston mobsters, most specifically the Angiulos of North Boston, in return for protection against any FBI action against himself, with only a handful of people within the Bureau in the know. Although reluctant at first in not wanting to be caught or thus identified as an informer, Whitey eventually agrees following a specific incident. The effect of their agreement on their professional and personal lives over the next twenty years is presented, as Whitey's criminal empire is allowed to flourish with the unfettered elimination of his competition, as Whitey does whatever he wants without FBI retribution to protect his own interests, and as those in the know within the FBI question whether Whitey has been of any real use to them.—Huggo In the opening scene, Agent Eric Olsen (Lonnie Farmer) is interrogating Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons). Olsen asks Kevin to tell him everything he knows about his involvement with the Winter Hill Gang of South Boston, the business dealings of former FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), and anything Kevin can say about his former boss/fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp).Flashback to Boston, 1975.Kevin is seen working as a bouncer outside a bar that Whitey (known to his friends and family as Jimmy) frequents with the other members of his gang - John Martorano (W. Earl Brown), Steve Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), and Tommy King (Scott Anderson). Whitey is introduced as criticizing Martorano for putting his fingers in his mouth after repeatedly taking from a bowl of nuts. Whitey is called outside when Kevin is fighting a man who turns out to be Whitey's cousin.The next day, Whitey makes Kevin drive him and another man, part of the Angiulo crime family, out by a beach where Whitey and Kevin both start to brutally beat the man up and leave him for dead. Later, Whitey goes back into town and greets an old woman who asks him about his stint in Alcatraz. Kevin tells Olsen that Whitey was well-liked in his part of town.Whitey goes home to his mother (Mary Klug), where they play Gin Rummy so he can pay her back some money. They are later joined for dinner by Whitey's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is the state senator.John Connolly, whom Whitey and Billy knew as kids, returns to Boston and has made a name for himself with the FBI. John meets Billy for lunch to try and get closer to Whitey, but Billy won't tell him anything.John later meets with Whitey at night. He proposes an idea for Whitey to be his informant to take down other mobs, specifically the Angiulos. Whitey doesn't like the idea of being a snitch for the FBI, but John persuades him on the grounds that Whitey can help take down those that, in Whitey's opinion, deserve to get screwed over.The Angiulos murder a Winter Hill Gang member, leading Whitey to go ahead and agree to be an informant. He confides in Steve over his actions, which surprises Steve.John discusses his plans to his boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) and fellow Agent Robert Fitzpatrick (Adam Scott). McGuire doubts John's success in taking down the criminals they're after, but John has some support from another co-worker, John Morris (David Harbour).While driving, Whitey and his boys run into a cop who says the Angiulos are trying to send the Winter Hill Gang a message. Tommy becomes abrasive and swears at the cop, but Steve and Martorano hold him back. The gang goes to the bar where Tommy is still fuming over his encounter with the cop, to which Whitey says Tommy wouldn't have done anything. Tommy gets up and tries to pick a fight with Whitey. He responds by getting up calmly and telling Tommy to take a shot and make it a good one. Tommy cools down and takes his seat.Whitey visits his girlfriend Lindsey Cyr (Dakota Johnson) and their son Douglas (Luke Ryan). During dinner, Lindsey brings up that Douglas got in trouble at school for hitting another kid. Whitey is proud of the boy, but says that he got in trouble because he struck the other kid while people were looking. Therefore, Douglas realizes it's totally okay to hit people when no one else is looking.John pleads with Whitey to not kill or commit any major crimes as long as he is an informant. However, Whitey disregards this when he brings Tommy out by the bridge and has Steve execute him with a shot to the back of the head, despite Whitey appearing to forgive Tommy for his outburst. They bury his body under the bridge, which Kevin mentions to Olsen as being referred to as the ""Bulger Burial Ground"" for the number of bodies Whitey and his boys have put under there.Whitey goes to visit Lindsey and Douglas, only to learn that the boy is sick. It gets worse later when Whitey joins Lindsey at the hospital. She tells him that Douglas started getting very angry and just fell into a motionless state due to Reye syndrome, leaving him on life support. Realizing he will be brain dead and with no hope left for the boy, Lindsey opts to pull the plug herself. Whitey criticizes her and calls her a murderer, to which Lindsey points out the hypocrisy in that statement. She leaves in tears while Whitey has an outburst and flips a table over.Flashing forward to 1981.By now, Whitey has taken over the Winter Hill Gang, but hasn't brought John back any results regarding the Angiulos. He has also separated from Lindsey after Douglas passes away. He's also got other people on his side, including unstable coke fiend Brian Halloran (Peter Sarsgaard). Brian is first seen coked up at a restaurant where he murders two of his drug dealers in front of everyone before walking out.A breakthrough comes when Whitey is able to deliver John pictures of the Angiulos meeting in local areas. This gives John and his buddies to opportunity to wiretap them and overhear the Angiulos talk about their dealings, including bringing in a lot of drugs. Subsequently, the Angiulos are busted, John becomes a hero at work, and Whitey has less competition to worry about. John becomes closer to Whitey and his boys, which upsets John's wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson).Whitey gets cut out of an embezzlement scheme for World Jai Alai. He gets Martorano to find the owner of World Jai Alai, Roger Wheeler (David De Beck) and murder him in his car after his weekly golf game. Also killed is their former contact for the scheme, John Callahan (Bill Camp), whom Martorano kills in his car and stuffs in the trunk.Whitey pays off Brian to keep his mouth shut. However, when Brian gets really coked up, he goes to the feds and spills the beans before John and Morris. They dismiss his confession as a bad coke episode. John later finds Whitey at the St. Patrick's Day parade and asks him if he killed Roger Wheeler. Whitey doesn't say a word, yet he knows what led to this question.Brian gets into a car with a friend, only for a bullet to his the other man. Brian tries to drive away frantically when he sees Whitey emerge with a rifle aimed at him. He shoots the car as Brian stumbles out, getting him shot in the leg. As Brian cries in pain, Whitey grabs a smaller gun and shoots him three times before he's dead. Onlookers see the dead bodies and scream as Whitey walks away.Later on, Whitey and Steve pick up Steve's prostitute stepdaughter Deborah (Juno Temple) from the police station. After Whitey asks her if she said anything to the cops, she affirms that she denied anything that could have hurt Whitey. Seemingly trusting her, Whitey takes her to an apartment building where he strangles her to death in front of Steve.A new district attorney, Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), moves into the Boston FBI HQ. John tries to befriend him with two tickets to the Red Sox game, but Wyshak refuses them. He is more interested in learning how Whitey has managed to evade police capture over the years.Whitey faces another problem when his mother passes away. He stands on the balcony at the funeral, away from Billy and his family. Now, the only thing that appears to put his mind at ease is his weapons dealings with the IRA.Whitey has dinner with John, Steve, and Morris at John's home. Whitey compliments the steak that Morris made and asks what he marinated it in. Morris says it's a family secret, but Whitey playfully presses him to tell. Morris finally admits it's ground garlic and soy. Whitey then states how easily Morris gave that up despite saying it was a family secret, and if he could spill that so easily, then he figures Morris can say anything else about Whitey. Whitey's demeanor visibly terrifies Morris until Whitey breaks into laughter and plays it off as a joke. He then asks John why Marianne hasn't joined them, to which John says because Marianne doesn't feel good. Whitey goes up to her room to talk to her, chastising her for not joining her husband's friends and putting his hands on her menacingly and also frightening her. This contributes to her later changing the locks on John.John McIntyre (Brad Carter), an informant in the Winter Hill Gang, rats Whitey out over his business with the IRA, leading the gang to beat and murder him.Things start to go downhill for the gang when Wyshak and McGuire really dig into John's business with Whitey. The final nail in the coffin is when Morris confesses to what he knows about Whitey and John's relationship, in exchange for immunity.Martorano, Steve, and Kevin are all arrested, and later on, so is John. He asks the feds to let him leave his house with dignity, but they don't let him When asked by Olsen how his opinion on Whitey has changed since his arrest, Steve says his opinion of Whitey is ""strictly criminal"".Billy sits in his living room looking somber, most likely already hearing about his brother. Whitey calls Billy from a payphone and says he'll be going away for a while, and he gives him one last goodbye. With that, Whitey would go on the run.The ending text states that Kevin Weeks and John Martorano served their time and that they walk the streets of Boston today as free men. Stephen Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders and is serving a life sentence. Billy Bulger left the state senate and would become president of the University of Massachusetts, but he was forced to resign after it was found out he kept in touch with his brother. John Connolly was convicted in the second-degree murder of John Callahan and was sentenced to 40 years in state prison.The final scene shows an older Whitey in 2011 when, after a tip-off to his whereabouts, he is promptly arrested outside a hotel after 16 years on the run. The real Whitey Bulger received two life sentences, plus five years for his other crimes."
Vacation,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1524930/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rusty Griswold takes his own family on a road trip to ""Walley World"" in order to spice things up with his wife and reconnect with his sons. Following in the footsteps of his father, Clark Griswold, the man with a vision inNational Lampoon's Vacation (1983), his son, too, the hard-working family man, Rusty Griswold, wants to have some quality time with his wife, Debbie, and their two sons, Kevin and James. With the idea of revisiting the place of his vivid childhood memories, the exciting Walley World, keep coming to mind, Rusty decides to surprise his family with his proposal for an unforgettable trip across the country in their rented Albanian SUV. However, as the Griswolds hit the road for some serious family-bonding, this is easier said than done, and, disaster after disaster, Rusty's romantic intentions seem to go down the drain. Can some minor mishaps thwart Rusty's plans for creating the perfect family vacation?—Nick Riganas In the opening scene, we are introduced to Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) who is a pilot for Econoair, a regional airline. He is show making the 18 minute flight from South Bend, Indiana to Chicago. He lands, and while waiting for the Crew Shuttle, he is bullied out of line by a rival pilot (Ron Livingston).At home we see Rusty is married to Debbie (Christina Applegate). His older awkward teenage son James (Skyler Gisondo) is being bullied by his younger brother Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Kevin wrote ""I have a vagina"" on James's acoustic guitar. Rusty fixes it by crossing out ""vagina"" and writing ""penis"".That night, the Griswolds have dinner with their neighbors the Petersons (Keegan-Michael Key and Regina Hall). Jack Peterson has a great relationship with his son. They built a go-kart and play fight. Rusty tries to show that he and his kids have the same great relationship, but Kevin isn't interested in pretending and James is just really bad at bonding. Nancy Peterson passive-aggressively gives Debbie a hard time about not liking her Instagram photos from the family's Paris vacation. She also comments on the fact that Debbie has lost so much weight that her wedding ring is loose on her finger. Rusty leaves the dining area, but comes back in time to hear Debbie reveal that she's disappointed that the family only ever vacations at their cabin in Cheboygan, Michigan every year and that she'd like to do something different.Rusty rents a car, the only thing left was a thing called a Prancer from the Ukraine. It has two gas tanks and is a hybrid, unfortunately the outlets are insane (and have corkscrews as part of the plugs). It also has too many mirrors and a ridiculous amount of buttons on the key fob including a swastika and a muffin. It was the only thing available that weekend. Rusty is recreating his favorite vacation from he was a kid, he's taking the family to Walley World in Los Angeles!During the first day's drive, Rusty tries to get the family to sing along with the song Kiss From a Rose by Seal. They have no interest. He shows the family that the car comes standard with a CB so they can talk to truckers. Rusty asks the truck behind them (which has a teddy bear mounted to the grill) if the road is clear of cops. The trucker says it is. Kevin gets on the CB and asks the trucker if its true that all truckers are rapists. Rusty bungles up an apology and explanation as the truck barrels past them.The family stops at a diner for lunch in Missouri. As they leave, we see the Teddy Bear Truck is in the parking lot.On the road, James sees a cute girl in the back of a Jeep and they have a wordless flirtation until Kevin puts a plastic bag over his head from behind and tries to kill him. Once James is free, the Jeep girl is gone.When the Griswolds get to Tennessee, Rusty decides to take a detour and show the boys where their mom went to college. They go to her old sorority house and see they're doing a ""chug run"" (an obstacle course you have to complete after you chug a pitcher of beer) to raise money for ""Ass Burgers"" instead of Aspergers. Debbie brags that she actually invented the chug run. One of the current sisters hears and asks if shes the legendary Debbie Does Anything. Debbie is clearly embarrassed that Rusty is finding out about her wild college days. The Sorority Sisters dismiss Debbie as being old, but to prove that shes still got it, she decides to do the chug run. Debbie chugs the beer and immediately starts projectile vomiting her way through the course.Back on the road, the Teddy Bear Truck is behind the Prancer. It speeds up and taps their bumper. Rusty speeds away, but the truck is hot on their tail. Rusty decides to pull a Fast and the Furious move and yank the emergency brake while turning so they can take off in the opposite direction and get away. His logic: ""If Vin Diesel can do it, so can I."" Rusty attempts the move and rolls the Prancer end over end along the highway. Luckily it ends up on its wheels and they take off.The family stops at a little motel and Rusty is a little embarrassed that Debbie clearly has experienced more than he has. They have the number conversation. Rusty has been with three women. Debbie has been with about 30 guys. He decides to spice up their sex life and says they're going to do it in the shower. The shower is unfortunately disgusting and they don't.Outside, James is playing his guitar while soaking his feet in the hot tub. The girl from the Jeep is staying at the same motel. The girl introduces herself as Adena (Catherine Missal). They're really starting to hit it off until Rusty comes out and tries to help. Instead of helping, he ends up looking like a paedophile and scares off Adena.The next stop is to visit Rusty's older sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her husband, an incredibly successful and handsome weatherman named Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth). Debbie is a little too enamored by Stone, so Rusty decides to make another detour first.The family stops at a hot spring, but the line to get in is really long. He asks a local passing by (with a rat on his shoulder) if he knows a shortcut. The local tells him to take the dirt road off to the side up until it ends. Rusty thanks the local and asks the pet rat's name. The local sees the rat, screams, and runs away. The Griswolds head up the dirt road and find the spring. At first it's great, but then they find an ear and a syringe. They realize its not a spring, but a septic dump. They get out and return to the Prancer only to find that the local broke in and stole all their stuff. Plus, the local also painted the shape of a penis on the side of the Prancer.The Griswolds get to Audrey and Stone's house. It's a huge ranch. Rusty wanted to make up a better excuse why they had no money, were in their swimsuits and covered in shit, but Kevin tells them everything. Stone is amazing. Everyone loves him.That night, Debbie is super turned on, but Rusty realizes it is just because she's turned on by Stone. In fact, her wedding ring is gone. She explains that its been loose lately and she lost it. She's really upset by that, but it was an accident. Stone comes in to tell them how to operate the remote control. He is only in boxer briefs and we can clearly see the outline of his massive penis.The next morning, Rusty wakes up early to help Stone wrangle cattle. Instead of horses, they ride 4 wheeler Quads. Rusty is of course in over his head and ends up riding right through a steer and it explodes. Stone hoses the steer guts off Rusty and the Griswolds are on their way again.That family stops at a reservation for the night. They're by the Four Corners Monument, so Rusty has the idea that he and Debbie should do it outside in four states all at the same time. They sneak off and go there. Unfortunately there are already dozens of naked couples with the same idea in mind. Four policemen from the four Indian states (Michael Pena, Nick Kroll, Kaitlin Olson and Tim Heidecker) swoop in to make arrests. Everyone flees except Rusty and Debbie. They too are able to escape when the four cops fight over whose jurisdiction this is.Back at the reservation, James runs into Adena again. He comes clean and explains that the paedophile was his dad trying to be his wing man. Right when they're about to kiss, Kevin comes out and ruins things. Adena thought James was being bullied by an older brother and doesn't understand why he just doesn't stand up to Kevin. James explains that he has been trying to be the bigger man. She asks how that has been working so far? It hasn't. So James finally stands up to Kevin and awkwardly wins.Back on the road, they stop at the Grand Canyon to go rafting. Their guide (Charlie Day) gets dumped by his fiancé right before the trip and decides to take a much more dangerous fork in the river towards a waterfall. The family barely makes it to safety, but the guide goes over the falls.Back on the road, Rusty tries to sing Kiss From a Rose again, but no one is having any part of it. This has all been too much. They're at the end of their ropes. The car runs out of gas. Rusty hits the muffin button on the key fob and the car starts up and drives away without them. He hits it again and the car blows up.The Griswolds don't understand why Rusty needs this vacation so bad. He explains that it was the time in his childhood when his dad pulled out all stops to try to do something for his family. He wanted to do the same, but that's it. He quits. He's done trying. The car runs out of gas in the desert. Rusty abandons the family and starts walking off. From down the road, the Teddy Bear Truck appears. Rusty runs away, it chases him. Rusty stops running and the driver (Norman Reedus) gets out to tell Rusty that he found Debbie's ring way back in the diner in Missouri. He gives the family a ride to San Francisco. Kevin apologizes for saying that all truckers like molesting kids and asks to make sure that's not true. The trucker doesn't answer. He drops them off at a Bed and Breakfast. Before the trucker leaves, Rusty asks why the Teddy Bear. The trucker says it's to make kids on the road feel safe. Rusty asks if the trucker has kids. The trucker says 'no' and drives off.The Bed and Breakfast is run by Rusty's parents, Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo). After spending the night, Clark tells Debbie that Audrey's life isn't so great. She and Stone sleep around on each other. Rusty finds out the copy of 'The Help' that Debbie has been reading throughout the movie is just the jacket for 'The Help'. She is actually reading a book about saving a dead marriage. He is upset. She says they don't have a dead marriage, because he never gave up on it. So Rusty decides he has to complete his mission. He can't give up on the family. He's taking them to Walley World. Clark lets his son borrow the old station wagon from the first Vacation movie and off they go. Rusty has sold his family on riding this new roller coaster called the Velociraptor and that's just what they're going to do.Rusty and the family finally get to the park and end up waiting in line five hours to ride the coaster. Right when they're next, the rival pilot from the beginning of the movie and his family cut in line because they have Fast Passes to the park. They're also the last family to get to ride. The park is closing. The Griswolds team up and beat the shit out of the other family and get on the coaster.As the coaster goes up the first hill, the Griswolds all start singing Kiss from a Rose together. When the coaster gets to the third loop it stalls upside down. Later that night, an emergency team has to go rescue everyone.The next day, Rusty flies the boys back home. He and Debbie are going to Paris. He used his airline connections to get seats. They're the rumble seats next to the bathrooms at the back of the plane where the flight attendants sit. Still though, they're going to Paris."

Joy's older half-sister, Peggy, is an overachiever who constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children for her failed marriage. Peggy and Rudy are very close, and Terri spends all day in bed watching soap operas, leaving Joy to run the household. Only Mimi, and Joy's best friend, Jackie, encourage her to pursue her inventing ambitions.. The film opens with a scene from a soap opera. One woman (Donna Mills) convinces another woman (Susan Lucci) that she needs to be a strong woman. Hands her a gun. Two male actors walk up and add to the scene, all filmed in a master shot from set so you can see how silly it looks when seen this way.We are told this film is a true story is inspired by strong women everywhere but mostly one in particular.The films narrator introduces herself she is Mimi (Diane Ladd) who introduces the girls we see playing outside her dad's auto body shop is a young Joy, there is her half-sister Peggy (from Joy's father's previous marriage), and there is Joy's close friend, Jackie. Mimi also introduces us to Joy's mother her daughter, Carrie (Virginia Madsen) who is obsessed with soap operas and Joy's father, Rudy (Robert De Niro), the owner of the auto shop. We also see Mimi for the first time when she tries to instill confidence in Joy despite her dysfunctional upbringing she tells Joy she is going to grow up to be a strong woman, meet a nice man, have beautiful children, and is going to build wonderful things.Young Joy is an inventor and she has built a house made of paper in her room. She tells her half-sister, Peggy, a story about a princess and her friends that live in the house Joy, herself, is represented by an origami swan and invited to play. Peggy tells her there needs to be a prince if there is a princess in the but Joy is adamant that there is no prince.In present day, Carrie (Joy's mom) is now watching a soap opera in her bedroom, which she never leaves. Because of this, Joy constantly has to cater to her and take care of her. At this moment, the adult Joy (Jennifer Lawrence) is in her airline uniform, looking in her mother's closet for the lanyard she needs for work. Instead she finds an old dog collar. She shows it to her mother, reminding her she invented it after choking their dog on a walk -- it has a breakaway material so dogs can't be choked. But her mom wouldn't get a patent for her and now another company has patented it and is selling it. Carrie just responds that she doesn't know how to do patents. We meet Joy's two children as she wrangles them up. The doorbell rings, surprising everyone. It turns out to be Joy's father who is having problems with his girlfriend of two years so he's moving back into the basement. Joy says he cant because her ex-husband lives down there. Carrie tells Rudy he can't stay there and he mocks her for watching soap operas and never leaving her room -- he tells her she's like a gas leak that is silently killing them all. They get into a quarrel and Rudy breaks a bunch of things, which upsets Carrie. Rudy goes downstairs into the basement to move in and Joy's ex-husband, Tony (Édgar Ramírez) is down there practicing a song in Spanish for an upcoming gig. Rudy and Tony begin to bicker. Joy tells them not to kill each other and uses a roll of toilet paper to divide the room in half. She goes upstairs, charging out the door with her cup of coffee to get to work. At the airline desk, a customer yells at her and throws her itinerary in Joy's face, demanding to speak to her manager. Joy's coworkers pull her aside and tell her she's been moved to the night shift which Joy points out she can't do because of her family.Joy visits her dad at his shop, tells him about her job. Her older half sister, the adult Peggy (Elisabeth Röhm) is there, and she tells Joy she should take over Peggy's position at the shop so she can do more important, managerial things for the company. She obviously has rivalry towards Joy and a self-aggrandizing attitude. It is mentioned that they have gun practice across the street (which will come into play later). Rudy makes a phone call about a woman he liked -- he reveals to Joy he joined a service via a 900-number where he finds single women based on their four digit ID number. He talks on the phone to his selection, who is named Trudy -- he finds this funny as his name is Rudy.At home, Carrie continues watching soaps in bed while Joy tries to fix a huge leak under her floorboards. The entire bedroom is flooding and Joy chastises her mom for rinsing her hairbrush (and hair) in the sink. It is now so clogged, Joy says it's beyond her abilities and she'll have to call a plumber. Carrie is nervous about a man coming into her room because she has retreated from the world. Joy falls asleep while the soap opera plays and dreams she is in a soap opera, with the characters from the show harassing her alongside her own family.We now flashback to what Joy's life has been like and why her family causes her such anxiety. Her parents get divorced 17 years earlier. They argue over visitation rights and Rudy accidentally destroys the origami house that was shown to be so important to Young Joy earlier.Years later, Joy's childhood friend Jackie (Dascha Polanco) invites Joy to a house party. When they arrive, a Mexican band is on stage, singing in Spanish. The lead singer is Tony, who grabs Joy and begins dancing with her. They go to the back room and have a conversation -- he brags that he's going to be a famous singer, the next Tom Jones. She tells him she was valedictorian of her class and got into a great college in Boston but had to give up on her dreams to stay home to watch her recluse mom. He tells Joy that her dreams are just on hold.The next time we see the two, they are performing in a musical theater show together. As fake snow falls on the stage, they sing a song to each other.Then we see their wedding. While Rudy is putting Joy's veil on her head, he tells her she should have married a lawyer or a doctor. She is annoyed he is telling her this at that specific moment (her wedding). When it's time to give a toast, Rudy goes into a huge speech about he likes Joy more than Peggy, he acknowledges his new girlfriend (the one who kicked him out at the beginning of the film), and tells Joy that her marriage won't last. He then accidentally breaks the glass he is toasting with. Cut to Joy and Tony fighting, with their two kids in the room. He thinks she's mad at him because he hasn't becoming famous and is just playing gigs at the same club over and over. She tells him it's because he drinks too much hence his current hangover. Her infant son begins to cry in Joys arms.Back to present day. There is a ring at the doorbell. Joy now remembers she hired a plumber, who is a handsome black man from Haiti named Tousssaint. At first, Carrie is very nervous about him entering the room, citing a soap opera plot line where a woman is kidnapped in her home. Carrie asks Toussaint how long hell be; he says it should only take a day. She then asks if he can put a sheet up so she can have her own space while he works. He politely agrees and calls her mademoiselle. This changes her feelings about him and she now seems entranced.Joy joins Rudy and his new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rosallina) on a date. She is an Italian woman whose husband has recently just died and she has been left with a lot of money. She tells Rudy about her husband's boat that she inherited and invites Rudy's family for a trip. Trudy asks them to bring wine but not red wine because it will stain the wood that her husband has had laid down on the deck.Cut to Tony bringing bottles of red wine onto the boat despite Trudy's discouragement. The yacht gets rocky and everyone struggles to keep his or her glasses from spilling. Joy's glass actually breaks which horrifies Trudy. While the others lounge, Joy tries to mop up the glass and when she goes to wring the mop, she finds her hands are all cut up from shards of glass.Back at her house, Joy's cuts are catered to. She begins to fall asleep on the stairs, terrified of sleeping in her bed because of all the weird dreams she's been having (i.e. the soap opera dream). The group gives her children's cough syrup to put her to sleep. When she wakes up, she begins thinking. She has a new idea for an invention. She runs upstairs to her daughter's room and begins drawing out her idea in crayon. Studies the yarn on a doll's hair.When Joy next sees Tony, she tells him she needs him to move out. He needs to get on with his life. Her father is ecstatic that he will now have the basement to himself but she tells him to move out, too. She says she has an idea for a new invention and she needs Trudy to put up the money. Rudy arranges for Trudy to pitch the idea in his office. Joy explains that she wants to design a self-wringing mop that you never have to touch, using her crayon drawings as visual aids. While she gives her speech, the work in the auto shop drowns out her voice so Rudy has to tell them to be quiet via the intercom. Trudy is skeptical, saying Joy doesn't have a prototype but instead just some drawing. Rudy chimes in, saying Trudy will have to see a model of what she is envisioning. Joy goes to one of the welders in her dad's shop and asks him if he can weld something for her.Joy works and develops a mold of what she wants. Her mother surprises her by leaving her room to say hello -- the plumber, Toussaint, is with her and it's obvious they are smitten with each other.Joy now pitches the prototype to Trudy, in the office again. This time, Jackie and Peggy are there. Joy loops 300 feet of cotton around Jackie's hands for several minutes until it's all combined into a mop head. She demonstrates how this means the mop is one continuous loop, which can easily be cleaned (instead of individual strings like most mop heads). She also adds you can remove it and clean it off in the washing machine. Trudy gives a speech that her husband worked hard every day for 50 years to earn his fortune and he said he would never forgive her if she mismanaged even one dollar. She was given four questions for prospective investment deals -- the first is, where did Joy go to high school? The second is, what was her position in school? (Joy answers she was valedictorian). This appeases Trudy. Peggy interjects, saying Joy has never run a business in her life. She points out that shes been managing the auto shop and any investments should go towards that and not Joy. Jackie interjects, asking what the third question is. Trudy asks if Joy can promise a return in six months. Joy agrees which makes Tony nervous. Joy is then asked the fourth question, which is in the form of an analogy -- ""There is a gun on the table. The only other person in the room is an adversary in commerce. Only one of you can prevail. Do you pick up the gun?"" Joy says it's a weird question but assures her she will, in fact, pick up the gun. Trudy says she will have to tell her lawyers that Joy said that. She's also going to check that there aren't any existing patents similar.After Trudy's lawyer does a search, he finds a patent filed in Texas for a similar design by someone in Hong Kong. They work with a manufacturing plant in California and so Trudy arranged that they would be a part of the enterprise in exchange for providing work for the plant. It's cheaper, anyway, than manufacturing it locally so Joy doesn't have any issue with this. Edgar is angry, complaining that Trudy's lawyer doesn't specialize in but Rudy tells him to shut up and they bicker as usual.Trudy gives Joy $50,000 to start up the operation. The plant in California sends over parts but they have overcharged her, billing her for redoing mistakes they made. This makes everyone nervous that they're dealing with unscrupulous people. Joy phones Gerhardt, the man who filed the patent in Texas, and tells him that he's overcharging her. He claims they were redoing her mistakes but she is not stupid and points out it was the plant's and he's trying to take advantage of her. She tells him she wont pay the overcharges. Joy hangs up to end the discussion, which impresses everyone else. She then tells all those in the office never to pay the overcharges.Now Joy has to find a place to sell the mops. She starts by going to the head of a local store and pitches the mop to him. He tells her he doesn't want to sell a $20 mop that you only have to buy once -- he wants to sell a $5 mop that you have to buy hundreds of in your lifetime. The fact that the mop only needs to be purchased one time is a bad thing, in his mind, because there's no return revenue.Now, with an excess of product, Joy has to try to sell one by one. With her daughter in tow, she sets up a display in the parking lot of Kmart and tries to convince women passing by to purchase one. Nobody stops or engages in conversation. So Jackie jumps in and Joy walks by with her daughter, pretending to be a customer who is talked into trying the mop. Right as people begin to take notice, the police come and confiscate the mops, telling her she can't solicit customers in their parking lot. Joy is upset they have taken three of her mops and goes back to her car -- she has to kick the car door to get it to open. When she gets home, there is a bill taped to the door -- she hasn't paid the phone bill. Joy has now reached a new low. She has been given a huge loan from Trudy but cannot find any way to sell the product.Then Tony, her ex-husband, visits and tells her he might have a friend who can help her sell the mop. (Its now clear that even though their marriage didn't work out, they still care a lot about each other). Tony drives Joy to Amish country for a meeting but the large corporate building they're headed to isn't related to the Amish it just happens to be nearby. They wait and wait all day but are ignored -- Tony hadn't scheduled a meeting; he just happens to know someone who works there. That friend comes out and says they have to come back tomorrow for a possible chance to meet the guy in charge. Joy demands just two minutes and steps inside with her mop. There is a large meeting going on in a boardroom and Joy promises she just needs two minutes. She tells them about the mop but the guys just make sexual references when she talks about wringing the head. The man in charge Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper) apologizes, says they're tired after a long day. He asks her if she knows where she is. She says, no. He tells her the company is QVC and gives a history of his track record -- he was a manager of several Kmart's and worked his way up and up until he became appointed to run QVC. He tells her it stands for Quality, Value, Convenience. They sell great products, not junk, which is what her mop is. She confidently tells him it's not junk.In the QVC bathroom, Joy mops up the entire place until it is clean. She points out that she didn't have to wring the mop once because it has 300 feet of continuous cotton. She then points to the adjacent kitchen, saying she has cleaned all over the toilet and would he use his family mop to then clean the kitchen, spreading those germs? With her mop, he can remove the mop head and wash it in the washing machine. Neil is convinced and he asks her if she can get 50,000 units by next week. Joy tells him, ""I think so.""Neil shows Joy around the makeup room in the building. The male spokesman is having a meltdown and he calms him down by telling him hes the best seller which upsets a spokeswoman seated nearby. Joy then is led out into the rotating studio. A dog runs to Joy as the stage rotates and it's revealed to belong to Joan Rivers (Melissa Rivers, playing her real-life mother). Neil points out they use celebrities to sell along with their hosts. We see Joan and the spokeswoman sell jewelry to the audience. Neil points out they're masterful at selling the product with their hands. The phones light up. The jewelry sells thousands and thousands, all kept track of on a large display nearby while dozens of phones are answered and callers gush about the product on air. Joy realizes she can sell out all her mops with this opportunity. But she needs more money.Trudy is reluctant to give Joy another $200,000 because she hasn't gotten her initial investment back. Peggy complains again, saying Joy shouldn't get that kind of loan when she actually has ideas that pertain to her father's business. Trudy decides it is only fair if Joy takes on the risk herself, putting up half of the money. It is suggested that she takes out a second mortgage. Joy is nervous but confident enough in QVC that she agrees. Now, realizing she might lose her home, Joy goes over to the gun range behind her father's shop. She asks the man if she can shoot off a few rounds. He tells her he's seen her grow up, coming in and out of the shop, but never talked to her. Joy shoots several rounds, apparently hitting her targets (we don't see). She then hands back the gun, having gotten the rage out of her system.An operation is set up in Rudy's auto shop, with the order supply is kicked up to fill the 50,000 units. Joy is polite and speaks in Spanish to a group of women who she trains to assemble the mops.Joy and her family gather around the TV to watch her mop being sold on QVC. The spokesman tries to demonstrate how to use it but he doesn't know how instead he drips water all over his shoes and complains about getting wet. No calls come in. After dead air, they move on to another product. Joys family is horrified they have $250,000 tied up into this product selling. Joy receives a phone call from Neil. She tells him the salesperson didn't know how to use the product but he said it just wasn't a good product. She explains she is going to lose her home; he tells her that her contract says QVC will cover one-third of the expenses lost but even that isn't guaranteed.Trudy is distraught, saying she will have to declare bankruptcy and suggests Joy does, too. Instead Joy drives to the studio, demands a meeting with Neil. She tells him she has to be the one on camera. He tells her, ""We don't use regular people. We use spokesmodels and celebrities"". He asks her if she's ever been on TV before, points out that most people freeze when the camera is on them. She tells him she uses the product so she will be the one to sell it. He is finally sold when she points out her demonstration in the QVC bathroom is what convinced him to put it on the air.Backstage, Joy gets all dolled up in the same makeup room she saw during the tour. She is given an early 90s hairstyle and then changes into a poofy black early 90s style dress. She tells Neil she wants to make just one change. She comes out and her hair is down and she's wearing a shirt and trousers. Joy tells Neil that's what she wears and that outfit is her. Joan Rivers walks by and says Joy looks good but she should be in a skirt to show off her great legs. Joy says she's going to have to ignore Joan Rivers suggestion.Now Joy goes on the QVC stage. The camera rolls. Countdown. And then she freezes. She mumbles on-air that she's Joy and doesn't know what else to say. The family is watching once again from home. At the station, there is dead air. Everyone is panicking. Then a stage manager says they have a call. Neil says to patch it through. Joy is confused; how can they have a call already? She hears Jackie's voice asking her about the mop. Joy perks up, knowing who's on the other end. She tells the caller that its a mop with 300 feet of continuous cotton that you can clean an entire floor with, without having to wring it. Jackie replies, ""That's perfect for my family. I want three"". Now Joy gets more confident and begins pitching the mop. The phones light up. Orders pour through. After its sold tens of thousands, she tells the audience she hasn't told them the best part you can remove the mop head and wash it in the washing machine. At the end of the broadcast, it has sold 50,000 units.Neil congratulates Joy backstage. She said she was afraid he was going to tell her the counter was broken.Joy goes on the QVC again, now selling 100,000 units. Neil tells her he is proud of her, and says that if they ever become adversaries in commerce, he hopes they'll still respect each other. The love fest is broken up when Joy receives an urgent phone call.The next scene shows Joy at the funeral of Mimi (ironically, Mimi narrates this event). Peggy shows up to the funeral late. Back at the house, Joy learns that Peggy was attending to some business in California. The manufacturing plant halted production until it could get more money. Peggy claims she took care of it by paying the money owed (when they overcharged Joy) and offering an extra $2 a unit. Joy is shocked, pointing out that if they paid that price, they would lose money. She now has to go to California herself with the argument that Peggy doesn't represent her company. She tells Peggy, Never speak on my behalf about my business again.Joy arrives in California in a dilapidated manufacturing factory. The waiting room has her mop on display, listed as their latest invention. When a man notices Joy waiting, she asks to speak to Marv Brickman but is told he's not there. But Marv shows up and begins to debate with Joy about the deal he's made with her half-sister. She says she didn't approve that deal and she will go broke if she agreed to it. Joy finds it funny that ever since they had a lot of sales on TV, the plant want to demand more money. She accuses him of shaking them down. He tells her she should be paying more now because the increase in demand causes wear on their machines, that her molds break and have to be replaced every day. She is skeptical of her molds needing daily replacement and asks to see them. She is told no. It's obvious she's not getting anywhere with them. She asks to use their bathroom.In the bathroom, Joy notices a side door that opens up into the factory. On a table is a blueprint of her mop design that they are claiming is their own. Marv finds Joy there and she screams at him, saying its her design. She tries to take back the molds but the police come and arrest her. Marv said he called them as soon as she showed up in the building. Outside, Joy is arrested for trespassing and put into a cop car.Joy is bailed out of jail by Trudy, who has flown to California with Rudy and Joy's daughter. Trudy points out that not only is she at a loss of over $150,000 but they now have new expenses flying there, bailing Joy out of jail. Joy has been told by their lawyer that when Peggy paid off the overcharges, it validated Joys work relationship with the factory. She can go to court and explain that Peggy had no jurisdiction to make business decisions on her behalf but the court case will take years and they'll probably not even rule in her favor she shares a patent with the guy in Texas, therefore its his product as well as hers. Joy complains that they should have dealt with a patent lawyer, like Tony had originally said. Trudy and Rudy tell Joy they need her to declare bankruptcy and a notary is outside the room, with the paperwork. Rudy tells Joy its his own fault for giving her the confidence to think she was more than just an unemployed housewife. Joy now begins crying, tells her young daughter never to believe that shes special or that the world owes her anything. Her daughter reminds Joy of Mimi's prophecy but Joy says Mimi was wrong; she wont achieve dreams. Hesitantly, Joy signs the bankruptcy papers. She then tears her crayon designs for the mop off the wall.Joy goes to sleep. Then in the middle of the night, she cuts off her long hair in the bathroom. With a shorter hairdo, she seems more mature and now has a new confidence about her.Joy flies out to Texas. She walks into her hotel and goes into her room. A man enters shortly after. She asks if hes Gerhardt. He says he could be or he could have been sent as a representative. Joy tells him that last night, she was distraught and called Hong Kong at 1:00 AM which is 5:00 PM their time she mumbles that it always amuses her how time works like that. When she mentioned to the Hong Kong inventor (who hired Gerhardt) about the patent, he said he was never told about the deal Gerhardt made with Joy. She points out this is fraud. She then looked into his design and realized its nothing like her own mop, after all. This is another count of fraud. She said her lawyers are very insistent that she file a lawsuit on these grounds. Immediately, Gerhardt backpedals and says hell pay back the $50,000 initial investment. Joy isn't happy with this deal. He offers another $20,000. She ignores him. Then he offers another $50,000. She now acknowledges him and suggests he adds interest, too. He does. She smiles and pulls out a contract that absolves their relationships. She writes in that he will pay her $50,000 plus $50,000 and interest. He signs.Joy walks down the street confidently. She looks into a stores window display. There is a house inside similar to the one she created as a young girl. A TV in the window says, Is it snowing? and on cue, fake snow begins to fall on her from overhead. Joy walks away.Mimi tells us, as the narrator, that Joy didn't know, when she walked down the street, what her life was going to become.We now see a giant estate and are told Joy moved into a nice home. She had 100 more inventions things like velvet hangers who conserve closet space. Hundreds of million sold because apparently this is the kind of thing that consumers want. Joy employed her family and remained close to them, even after they sued her, claiming they were owed some of her money and that they were more involved in the inventions than they were.Neil stops by and visits Joy on her estate. He wants her to work on the Home Shopping Network as QVCs biggest success story but she is hesitant. Their fondness for each other is adamant after all these years.Joy sets up an office in her house for inventors like herself. A woman comes in with her husband and baby. Joy is very sweet and respectful to her, unlike the men she met with when she was pitching the Miracle Mop. Joy asks the lady where she's from, what hotel she's staying at. The woman shows her product to Joy a lint roller you can bring with you when you travel. Joy compliments the prototype and asks the woman to come back tomorrow. The woman tells her she only has one day off from work. Joy says she will have her team make a call to ensure the woman can stay an extra day. She also upgrades the woman to a nicer hotel so shell have more room for her baby. Joy says shes eager to have the design team meet with the lady so they can begin working on developing her invention for mass consumption."

He offers Reed a scholarship so he goes to New York to work on it and he works with Storm's daughter Sue and his former student Victor Von Doom. Storm also brings in his son Johnny, a mechanic to help him. When Reed says it's done, Storm decides to send him, Sue, Johnny and Victor. Reed asks his best friend Ben Grimm to join him. When they get there, they're exposed to elements not native to their own, And when they return, they start to change or gain abilities.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The nerd teenager Reed Richards has been researching teleport since he was a kid, helped by his best friend Ben Grimm.. During a high-school scientific fair, he is invited by Dr. Franklin Storm to join his research team in his institute in New York. Reed teams up with Dr. Storm's son and daughter Johnny Storm and Susan ""Sue"" Storm and the outcast Victor Von Doom and they succeed to send a monkey to another dimension. Soon they learn that the institute has an agreement with NASA to send astronauts to the other universe. However they decide to go by themselves to be the first humans to reach the place. However there is an accident and they are all affected by the power in the planet. Further, they achieve super-powers, but Victor is left behind. What will happen to the researchers?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Struggling to complete their ambitious project and perfect their untested teleportation device, the science genius, Reed Richards, and his best friend, Ben Grimm, finally get the chance to prove their worth at the local science fair. However, an ill-advised venture into the dangerous Planet Zero, along with the fellow scientist, Victor Van Doom, and their supporter Dr Franklin Storm's children, Sue, and Johnny, will pave the way for an unforeseen complication, and an unexpected mutation. Now, Richards turns into the rubber-like Mr Fantastic; Sue becomes the Invisible Girl; Johnny commands fire at will as the Human Torch, and Ben transforms into the Thing, a mountain of rocky muscles. Can this new team of untried super-heroes thwart the plans of an unstoppable megalomaniac who wants nothing less than the world?—Nick Riganas In the year 2007, young Reed Richards does a presentation for his class and states that he wants to be the first person to teleport through dimensions. His classmates laugh at him and his teacher Mr. Kenny (Dan Castellaneta) mocks his goal, but Ben Grimm takes an interest in Reed's words.Later that night, Reed sneaks into Ben's family's junkyard and gets him to help him bring a device into his basement. Reed gets a toy car and attempts to show Ben that teleportation is very real. He activates his machine and fries every transformer in the neighborhood, but he manages to teleport the car and sees a pile of rocks where the car used to be. Ben tells Reed he's insane.Seven years later, teenage Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are best friends entering a science fair to show off their machine. Reed teleports a kid's model plane but causes an energy surge that breaks a basketball net, disqualifying him. He and Ben are approached by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Impressed by Reed's invention, Franklin invites him to join him in a project at the Baxter Foundation. Ben later gives Reed his old pocketknife as a going-away present.Franklin speaks before a board of other researchers headed by Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson), who isn't too eager to put young scientists on this project. Franklin wants to use inter-dimensional travel to acquire new resources that can be used on Earth. He later goes to see out Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), as he is the one that started the project. Franklin finds him in a shack and urged him to go back and work with him, despite Victor being rejected before. Victor only agrees because he has a thing for Sue.Meanwhile, Franklin's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) in a street race. He initially stalls out but catches up and puts the pedal to the metal... until his car's engine blows out. Franklin finds Johnny in the hospital as he is leaving with an injured arm and scolds him for wasting his potential, but Johnny resents his dad for putting more focus on his work than his family.Johnny joins the team and quickly befriends Reed. Victor is cold and snobby towards them, but the whole team works together and creates a bigger teleportation machine based off of Reed's designs, known as the ""Quantum Gate"". After the machine is complete, the team sends a little chimp through the other dimension, which they call ""Planet Zero."" They receive video surveillance of the planet, and they successfully bring the chimp back in one piece. Allen then tells the team that he and the other board members will be recruiting NASA members to be the first human subjects to travel to Planet Zero, despite Franklin trying to convince Allen that the team is ready.Reed and Johnny share a drink with Victor as they lament this news. They decide that they're gonna go ahead and teleport themselves anyway. Reed calls Ben and invites him to join them.The four guys suit up and teleport themselves to Planet Zero. Sue picks up a notice that the Quantum Gate was activated and she calls Franklin to the lab. On Planet Zero, the guys find soil and a green substance that reacts to organic matter. It starts to turn in a bad way and then causes an eruption. Realizing the place is unstable, the guys run back to the Quantum Gate. They climb back up a hill, only for Victor to be hit by a lot of the substance, causing him to fall into it. The other three run back and contact Sue, but Ben's pod gets filled with rocks while Johnny gets hit by a big ball of fire. They're teleported back, bringing a wave of radiation with them that hits Sue as well, making her partially invisible. When Reed comes to, he crawls over to Ben as he calls for help beneath a pile of rocks. Johnny is unconscious and completely on fire. Reed then sees his leg has stretched to an unnatural length and he faints.Reed awakens to find himself strapped to a bed with his limbs stretched out. He repeatedly asks for Ben but none of the doctors answer him. When they leave, he removes the straps and crawls through the air vents as he hears Ben calling for him. When Reed finds him, he sees Ben has been mutated into a huge rock creature. He begs Reed for help, but Reed hears people coming. He promises Ben he'll be back for him, and Reed escapes. He flee from the facility known as Area 57 and flee into the forest.One year later. Allen has used Ben/Thing as an asset in warfare due to his size and strength. He is seen smashing tanks on the field. Johnny/Human Torch has managed to control his fire and flight powers, while Sue/Invisible Girl is exercising her invisibility and force field powers. Both have been given suits to accommodate these powers. Meanwhile, everyone is still looking for Reed. Sue tracks the pattern of the last few places he's been spotted. She gets a reading by tracking his emails, recognizing ""cptn_n3mo"" from when they talked about ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.""Reed is in Panama, able to disguise himself by altering his facial features. He detects that the airbase is breached and he is found by some mercenaries. Reed avoids their attacks by stretching and escaping, but Ben catches him. Feeling betrayed by Reed for abandoning him, he headbutts Reed and has him brought in.Reed is taken to Area 57. Allen tells him that he wants Reed to help reactivate the Quantum Gate, and they may be able to find a cure from Planet Zero. Reed reluctantly agrees to help his friends.After some time, Reed is reunited with the other three and a group of explorers re-enter Planet Zero. They detect a life form in the distance. It's Victor. The explorers bring him back and see his whole body coated in metal, a result of his suit fusing with him and the green substance. Victor awakens and says that he has grown stronger on Planet Zero and feels that he must destroy Earth to recreate Planet Zero in his own image. He starts to manipulate the objects in the room and kills a couple of doctors before blowing up Allen's head. Victor breaks out and continues blowing up heads before getting back to the Quantum Gate. Franklin tries to stop him, but Victor fries him. Before dying, Franklin tells Sue and Johnny to look after each other. Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben run after him and follow him through the Gate.Everyone is back on Planet Zero. Victor has opened a black hole in order to absorb Earth matter and destroy it. The four realize they need to take him out in order to take out the portal. Victor continues manipulating the environment against the four, pinning them down. Reed tells them that he may be stronger than each of them, but not all of them together. Sue maintains a force field on the portal briefly while Reed distracts Victor. Ben declares, ""It's clobberin time!"" and punches Victor into the path of the black hole, absorbing and destroying him. Johnny then manages to close the portal while he flies and Sue brings herself, Reed, and Ben back to Earth.The military, while hesitant to continue working with the four, reward them for saving the world and agree to give them a private base of operations. Reed decides the team needs a name. Ben admires the place and comments that it's fantastic. And suddenly, Reed knows what to call the team.The Fantastic Four... end credits."
The Hateful Eight,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters. Some time after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. Bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive captive Daisy Domergue race towards the town of Red Rock, where Ruth will bring Daisy to justice. Along the road, they encounter Major Marquis Warren (an infamous bounty hunter) and Chris Mannix (a man who claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff). Lost in a blizzard, the bunch seeks refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive they are greeted by unfamiliar faces: Bob, who claims to be taking care of the place while Minnie is gone; Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock; Joe Gage, a cow puncher; and confederate general Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside, the eight travelers come to learn that they might not make it to Red Rock after all...—Jordan Crighton Wyoming in the 1870s. A stagecoach is heading towards the town of Red Rock with two passengers onboard. One is John ""Hangman"" Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), a celebrated bounty hunter. The other is Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), his prisoner and wanted for murder. Along the way they pick up another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson), and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Due to a blizzard they are forced to hole up in a store some way out of town with the occupants of another stagecoach. Suspicions commence and Civil War enmities are reawakened.—grantss Years after the American Civil War, bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren is transporting three dead bounties to the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. He hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson. Aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth, and handcuffed to him is fugitive Daisy Domergue, whom Ruth is escorting to Red Rock to collect her bounty and watch her hang. Ruth and Warren are previous acquaintances who bonded over Warren's personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Former Lost-Causer militiaman Chris Mannix, who is traveling to Red Rock as the town's new sheriff, persuades Ruth and Warren to let him on the stagecoach. Warren and Ruth form an alliance to protect each other's bounties.. In snow-capped post-Civil War Wyoming, the rugged bounty hunter, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth, defies an imminent blizzard, bent on delivering his shackled prisoner, Daisy Domergue, to Red Rock to stand trial for murder. With the snowstorm rapidly approaching, John and his new undesirable travel companions--the fellow bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren, and Red Rock's soon-to-be-appointed sheriff, Chris Mannix--will have no other choice but to seek shelter in Minnie's Haberdashery. But, there, another unwelcome encounter awaits, as four more suspicious strangers are added to this already volatile motley crew. Engulfed in this unforgiving white hell, the hateful eight must endure each other until the storm weakens; however, who is friend, and who is foe?—Nick Riganas Note: The movie is divided into six narrative sequences, all of which take place chronologically, with the exception of Chapter Five, which takes place before the others.Chapter One: ""Last Stage to Red Rock""Set in the dead of winter in post-Civil War Wyoming, Major Marquis ""The Bounty Hunter"" Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) attempts to hitch a ride on a stagecoach driven by O. B. Jackson (James Parks). Warren is trying to transport the corpses of three outlaws to Red Rock for a handsome reward; O. B. instructs Warren to consult the passenger of the coach, one John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell), himself an infamous bounty hunter. Ruth is escorting fugitive Daisy ""The Prisoner"" Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock - alive - to collect a $10,000 reward, and to see her hanged. To ensure she cannot escape, Ruth has handcuffed her to his own arm. Ruth and Warren know each other, having seen each other in Chattanooga some eight months before.Ruth agrees to let Warren ride with them to a passover called Minnie's Haberdashery, where they intend to take shelter from an oncoming blizzard. While riding, Ruth asks Warren to see his letter written to him by Abraham Lincoln. Warren produces the letter, which Ruth reads. Then Daisy spits on the letter, and Warren hits her in the face, causing her to fall out of the carriage, yanking Ruth out of the carriage as well. Warren signals the driver to stop the coach while Ruth picks himself up. Warren exits the coach to find his letter, and throws snow in Daisy's face. The driver sees another man in the road. Ruth makes Warren put on handcuffs, suspecting the Major is in cahoots with Daisy or the new man.Chapter Two: ""Son of a Gun""They are approached by Chris ""The Sheriff"" Mannix (Walton Goggins), who is also looking to hitch a ride to Red Rock. He says his horse stepped in a hole in the snow, and recognizes Ruth and Warren, but not Daisy. He claims to have been appointed the title of Sheriff of Red Rock and to be the person who is supposed to pay the bounties Ruth and Warren seek to collect. Ruth tells Warren that Mannix is the youngest son of the leader of the ""Mannix Marauders"", a group who terrorized South Carolina following the Civil War. Mannix refuses to wear handcuffs, and insists on coming aboard since Ruth will be charged with murder if he causes his death. Ruth reluctantly allows Mannix to ride with them, but uncuffs Warren and has him hold a gun on Mannix for the remainder of the ride. Ruth knows Mannix would never work with Warren since he is notoriously racist.On the coach, Mannix says he will buy the two men dinner and a drink at the Haberdashery. Ruth says he does not drink or break bread with rebel renegades. Mannix says, ""it sounds like you have an ax to grind against the cause,"" and Ruth says that there was no cause, just terrorizing people, especially (he points out to Warren) emancipated blacks. Domergue says she supports that kind of thing. Mannix says that Ruth is misinformed by Union newspapers.Mannix asks Warren if Ruth knows how famous Warren once was. Warren's answer is no. Mannix asks if Daisy knows Warren. She says she knows he had a huge bounty from when he Confederacy put a $30,000 on Warren's head, and he was openly suspected in the North of just wanting to kill white people. Warren's bounty fell to $5,000, but people would still try to collect it. Warren says he has killed several of them. Warren, a Union veteran, tells Ruth of how he burned down Wellenbeck prison camp in order to escape.Mannix is offended because many young southern men died there, but Warren is indignant, asking why he should apologize for killing Confederates who wanted to enslave him. Mannix says that he also killed 37 Union prisoners of war. Warren says indifferently that ""people die in war."" Mannix says ""War is hell"" is hard to argue with, but that the Union also investigated him following the war. Mannix claims that Warren was ultimately forgiven because of his service in the cavalry during wars against indigenous people.Ruth says that Mannix has no right to talk, given the atrocities that his father inflicted on black people. Mannix says not to talk about his father, who was fighting for the dignity in defeat that southern white men, as the ""brothers"" of those in the North, deserved. Warren asks how many black towns Mannix raided in this struggle for dignity. Mannix says many, and that when black people are scared, white people are safe. Warren immediately points the gun straight at Mannix's temple and says that if he speaks so hatefully, Warren will kill him immediately. Mannix is very scared, says he only starting talking ""politics"" by mistake, and goes to sleep.Chapter Three: ""Minnie's Haberdashery""The group finally arrive at Minnie's Haberdashery with the blizzard bearing down fast, and they find it in the hands of Bob ""The Mexican"" (Demian Bichir), who explains that the owner, Minnie Mink (Dana Gourrier), is visiting family for a week and has entrusted the passover to him; Warren is suspicious of Bob's explanation. Ruth and Daisy go inside and meet the others staying at the haberdashery. The lock on the door is broken and the door needs to be secured shut with nails and boards. Oswaldo ""The Little Man"" Mobray (Tim Roth), introduces himself as the hangman of Red Rock and speaks with an English accent. He asks to see the warrant Ruth is carrying for Daisy. Meanwhile, in the blinding wind outside, Warren, Mannix, O.B. and Bob put the horses in a nearby stable. Mannix and O.B. further set up ropes and iron stakes to find the outhouse and stable in the snow, and Warren stays behind to help Bob with the remaining stablework. Warren asks Bob again where Minnie is, and says it doesn't sound like her to have left Joe ""The Cow Puncher"" Gage (Michael Madsen), a quiet cowboy and Sanford ""The Confederate"" Smithers (Bruce Dern), an aging former Confederate General. Ruth, suspicious that they may be trying to ambush him and release Daisy, announces his intent to deliver Daisy to Red Rock alive and forcefully disarms all but Warren of their pistols.Over a dinner of hot stew, Mannix teases Warren over his letter from Abraham Lincoln, saying that there is no chance Warren was friends with Abraham Lincoln. Ruth says that he is surely telling the truth, but Warren reveals that it is a lie. Mannix and Daisy laugh. Ruth spitefully throws stew in Daisy's face. Ruth is angered and loses trust in Warren, saying that it must be true what people say: that you can't trust black people. Warren asks Ruth if he hurt his feelings and Ruth says yes. Warren rebuts by saying that Ruth cannot understand what it is like to be a black man faced with America. Warren says that black people are safe when white people are disarmed, and the letter disarms white people (sets them more at ease). Ruth says it is still a dirty trick to him. Warren points out that it got him a seat on Ruth's stagecoach.Mannix says the letter wouldn't have worked on him. Daisy says she spat on it, and Mannix congratulates her for it. Warren brings Sanford food and asks to join him. Sanford says yes and Warren places a gun on a side table next to Sanford. Warren reveals to Sanford that he murdered Chester Smithers, Sanford's son, in retaliation for the latter trying to kill him (most likely for the bounty). Warren taunts Sanford with the humiliating details of his son's death, claiming he was forced to march naked in the snow for over two hours and perform fellatio on Warren before being killed. In a fit of rage, Sanford reaches for the gun to shoot Warren, but Warren swiftly draws his other gun and shoots Sanford dead, much to Mannix's dismay.Chapter Four: ""Domergue's Got a Secret""Daisy asks to play the guitar and Ruth says yes. A narrator then reveals that while everybody was distracted by Sanford's death, an unseen character slipped poison into the brewing coffee, which only Daisy witnessed. Ruth and O.B. drink the coffee, and Daisy smiles knowingly. She sings a beautiful song on the guitar, which she plays well. Ruth asks to hear another verse as he drinks coffee, and Daisy sings a verse that end with the line ""You'll be dead behind me John as I go to Mexico."" Ruth becomes furious, takes the guitar and smashes it before handcuffing Daisy to himself once again.Mannix pours himself a cup of coffee. Suddenly Ruth violently vomits blood on the table, just as Mannix is about to take a sip. O.B. also vomits blood, and collapses onto all fours, repeatedly vomiting up more blood. Ruth throws the coffee cup away, and Mannix realizes it was the coffee and throws his cup away too. As Daisy mocks a dying Ruth, the latter tries to kill her, only for her to seize his pistol and shoot him dead.With Ruth and O.B. dead, Warren lines up the rest of the lodgers at gunpoint and throws the key to Ruth's handcuffs in stove, ensuring that Daisy cannot escape. Warren determines that Mannix could not have poisoned the coffee since he was about to drink it himself, so he gives Mannix a spare gun. He goes on to explain that the stew they ate was made by Minnie that morning, so something must have happened to her. Bob asks Warren if he is really accusing him of murder.Warren then explains that Bob's story about Minnie entrusting the place to him cannot be true, since she hated Mexicans. He also finds a dried bloodstain on one of the armchairs, and hypothesizes that Bob murdered Minnie; he knows, however, that Bob cannot be the person who poisoned the coffee since he was playing the piano at the time. He shoots and kills Bob because he knows he was involved in killing Minnie, only to be shot in the groin from underneath the floorboards by a shadowy gunman. Mobray then draws a gun and shoots Mannix, hitting him the thigh, before the latter shoots him back, hitting Mobray in the abdomen.Chapter Five: ""The Four PassengersEarlier that morning....A stagecoach arrives at Minnie's Haberdashery containing the four passengers: Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Jody (Channing Tatum). They are driven by the cheerful and cheeky Six Horse Judy (Zoe Bell), who hails from New Zealand. They are met by Charlie (Keith Jefferson) outside Minnie's. Charlie, a black man, stays outside and helps the carriage driver with his horses before he travels on. Judy leads the passengers inside and introduces them to Minnie Mink. Minnie is shown to be a cheery, black woman perhaps in her thirties, and is there with a black woman, Gemma (Belinda Owino) cooking. Two older white men, Sweet Dave (Gene Jones) and the previously seen Sanford, are playing chess by the hearth.The crew makes small talk for a few minutes before violently massacring everybody in the lodge, leaving only General Sanford alive. Charlie comes in from outside just in time to see the massacre, and is shot by Bob in the doorway (one of the shots destroys the door's latch) before fleeing outside. Mobray asks in Spanish if they should perhaps keep Sanford alive to create the illusion of a more lively setting. They agree to try it, and Jody talks to the old man while his crew starts cleaning up the mess the massacre left. Gage goes to kill Charlie, whom he finds hiding in a shed and shoots in the throat with a shotgun as he begs for his life.Jody explains to Sanford that they are preparing to ambush Ruth to rescue Jody's sister, Daisy, and that they will not kill him if he agrees to keep quiet about their plan. Sanford agrees, and the bandits all prepare for Ruth to arrive: throwing the bodies down the well, hiding guns around the lodge, cleaning up the jelly beans that had spilled. Jody hides in the basement (implying that he was the one who later shot Warren in the crotch from under the floorboards).Chapter Six: ""Black Man, White Hell""We cut back to the present as, Warren, in agonizing pain, is confined to a bed while he and a wounded Mannix hold guns on the surviving lodgers - Domergue, Gage, and a mortally wounded Mobray. Warren tells Mannix his genitals are destroyed, and he thinks he will bleed to death. They flush Jody out of the basement by threatening to kill Domergue. Warren shoots Jody through the head, killing him. Domergue becomes hysterical, berating Mannix for working with a black man. She then attempts to strike a deal with Mannix, explaining that her brother was the leader of a notorious gang and that 15 of his men are waiting in Red Rock. Domergue further claims that these men will hunt down Mannix if he kills her, however she will call them off if he kills Warren instead. Mannix tells Warren Domergue has ""nothing to sell,"" but to humor him as he listens to Domergue's offer. They count up the bounties that Mannix could collect: Bob, revealed to be ""Marco the Mexican"" with a bounty of $12,000, and Mobray, really Pete Hicox, with a bounty of $15,000, and Gage, really Grouch Douglas, has a bounty worth $10,000.Domergue explains that they cannot collect the bounties if they kill her since the gang waiting in Red Rock will kill them. She also says the gang will sack the town and kill all the residents. If Mannix as sheriff wants to protect the town, he should spare her life. Warren shoots Domergue in the foot. Hicox tries to convince Mannix again that they can forgive him what he has done if he kills Warren. Warren shoots Hicox in the leg. The scene is then interrupted when Gage reaches for a pistol that he had previously hidden underneath a table. Mannix and Warren shoot him dead.Warren tries to shoot Domergue, but his gun is out of bullets. Warren begs Mannix for his pistol, Mannix smiles and sits down. He asks Domergue about the offer: he kills Warren, they wait two days, and then he gets the bounties for Oswaldo and Gage. Domergue ascents. Mannix asks about Jody's bounty, since he is worth $50,000. Warren asks Mannix if he is about to make a deal, and Mannix says they're just talking. Domergue says he is being greedy and that she must take that body, since Jody has children. So Mannix goes over the terms again before looking back at Warren. He turns back to Domergue and says ""no deal"".Domergue says he is making a big mistake, and that the gang will come and kill him. Mannix says that in order for him to be afraid, he would have to believe that those 15 men existed, which he doesn't. Warren laughs. Mannix says Douglas poisoned the coffee and points out that Domergue didn't say anything as he was about to drink the coffee, too- showing that she didn't care about his life. He says she is a liar and is surely just saying what she needs to in order to escape being hanged. He says he suspects that what remains of Jody's gang is lying dead on the floor.Domergue replies that Jody leads an army of men, but Mannix interrupts her and says that his father led an army, a renegade army fighting for a lost cause- 400 men who followed because of their respect for his command. Warren nods appreciatively, then Mannix says he doesn't feel so good and collapses on the floor, fainting due to his leg wound.Daisy cuts Ruth's handcuffed arm off with a machete, freeing herself, before reaching for the gun Douglas dropped on the floor. Mannix suddenly wakes up (or reveals himself to have been playing possum) and shoots Daisy, wounding her. As he prepares to shoot her again, Warren convinces him to spare her so that they can hang her, just as Ruth wanted to. Since Ruth saved their lives from the storm, they can act out his last wish: to see Domergue hanged.Domergue is hanged from the rafters of the lodge. Mannix pronounces it as his first and final act as sheriff of Red Rock. Mannix is left lying on top of Warren, but then he drops down off the bed and onto the floor. The two men delight in seeing Domergue slowly strangle to death in accordance with Ruth's final wishes and the law.Mannix asks Warren if he can read his letter. Mannix takes the letter in his bloody hands and reads it aloud. In it ""Abraham Lincoln"" praises Warren for his service and expresses the belief that racial progress is being made slowly in America. Mannix remarks on the final line of the letter, ""Ol' Mary Todd is calling so I guess it's time for bed,"" that it was a nice touch, and Warren thanks him. Mannix crumples the letter up and throws it away, and the movie ends with Mannix and Warren waiting to die."

When they meet again 3 years later he does everything he can to win her back.—alisondifor Nicky has studied the science of human nature his whole life, and understands precisely how to earn anyone's trust, or fool them into never noticing he's stealing their watch, or wallet, or anything they might have that Nicky can sell. In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky.. Con man Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) goes to a bar in New York City. There, he sees a beautiful young blonde woman (Margot Robbie) with another man, who seems to be pestering her. She escapes from him - he later falls asleep, drunk - and goes to Nicky's table. Her name is Jess. They go upstairs to her hotel room and start to make out. A man then bursts into the room with a gun, threatening to shoot Nicky. Jess says he's her husband. Nicky then quips that he's got cancer, and the man says he doesn't want to shoot a guy with cancer. Jess figures that Nicky is on to them. Nicky says how they should have handled it if they really wanted to rob him before he leaves.Jess finds Nicky a few nights later and begs him to teach her his ways after she's done her research on him. Nicky mentions a story to her about two partners involved in a con gone wrong where one partner had to shoot the other to make it seem like they weren't working together. They happened to be Nicky's father and grandfather, and the former shot the latter in something called the ""Toledo Panic Button"". Nicky agrees to teach her and says the act of conning people is a game of focus. He shows her how her works his hands so that she can't tell when he's swiped something off her person.Nicky takes his business to New Orleans with his friend Horst (Brennan Brown), and their own team of con artists. It's Super Bowl week, so the city is packed full of people. Jess joins them down there for a practice round of conning. They take her through the crowded streets where they swipe watches, wallets, and other trinkets off unsuspecting people. They also take Jess through a hotel casino for another round. After she proves her worth, she is allowed on the team. On a sidenote, we see Nicky may have a gambling problem as he loses money at a horse track.Jess meets Nicky's friend and associate Farhad (Adrian Martinez). He is involved in more complicated schemes, as he is seen removing a fake ATM that is used to nab private information. Jess takes a liking to Farhad despite his often crass behavior.Over time, Nicky and Jess develop a mutual attraction. After sex, Jess asks Nicky why some people refer to him as ""Mellow"". He says his father used to call him that because he told him he was soft like a marshmallow. Nicky believes that there's no room for heart in this game because it can get you killed.The night before the big game, with all their conning complete, Nicky addresses the team and congratulates them on a record week, $1.2 million worth. He sends everybody home with his usual promise to send them their cut. Horst gives Nicky the bag of cash, and makes Nicky promise he won't gamble with it. Nicky promises as Jess looks on.Nicky and Jess go to the football game. They make small bets with each other such as if one fan will catch a hot dog, and if another is too drunk to get up for the wave. They see a woman in short shorts and bet how many men will look at her ass as she walks by. Jess bets 8 while Nicky bets 3. A curious man named Mr. Liuyan (B.D. Wong) joins the game and bets 5. Seven men check out the woman as she walks by, making Jess the closest. Liuyan makes more bets with Nicky over the game, practically begging him to play when Nicky tries to back out. Nicky plays and loses $1,000. The bets escalate as the two men double the bets, even as Jess tells Nicky they should just leave. After losing $100,000, it looks like Nicky has finally had enough and is about to walk away. Mr. Liuyan goads him back in, and Nicky bets all the remaining cash ($1.1 million) on a simple high card draw. Liuyan pulls the card with a higher number, winning all their money. Nicky and Jess are heartbroken. Nicky chooses not to walk away and decides to double the bet again. He tells Liuyan to pick any player on the field, and he will guess which one, seemingly impossible odds. Mr. Liuyan thinks he is crazy and doesn't bet on crazy, so he refuses. Nicky sweetens it when he says Jess will pick the player that Liuyan spotted, much to Jess's terror. Liuyan can't turn down free money, so he picks a player. As Jess nervously looks through the binoculars, Liuyan gives them a chance to back out. Jess looks to Nicky, seemingly begging him to take this chance to back out, but Nicky tells her to pick. Jess again nervously scans the players. All of a sudden, she spots Farhad wearing a jersey with 55 on it. She grins and picks him, and to everyone's surprise, that's the correct answer.On the taxi ride home, Nicky, now with a LOT of money on him, explains to Jess that this was set up from the beginning of the day. He knew that Liyuan is a notorious gambler, so he had it set up so that Liuyan would see the number 55 throughout the day, thereby subconsciously getting him to pick that number when the moment was right. Nicky then has the taxi pull over while another car pulls up behind them. He tells the cabbie to take Jess to the airport. He leaves her with her share of money and departs without another word, leaving Jess confused and heartbroken.Three years later.In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Nicky is working with a billionaire race car owner named Rafael Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro) and his associate, Owens (Gerald McRaney). They are in possession of a revolutionary new fuel burn algorithm, which will give them an edge in the upcoming season. But Garriga is nervous this won't be enough, so their plan is for Nicky to pose as a disgruntled former employee of Garriga, and sell a fake version to another team owner McEwen (Robert Taylor), who is Garriga's biggest competition. This will make the competition slower, while Garriga gets faster.Nicky goes to a party at Garriga's mansion where he sees Jess for the first time since he left her, descending the staircase in a stunning red dress. She kisses Garriga, to Nicky's disdain. He approaches Jess afterward, where she assures him that she's doing just fine on her own. Nicky plays his part of disgruntled employee, and is later approached by McEwen.Nicky spends a lot of his time trying to get closer to Jess, even though she's done with him. This eventually leads to them going back to Nicky's hotel room and having sex. The next morning, Owens goes to Nicky's room while Jess stays out of sight. Owens complains about his feelings toward the younger generation and his lack of progress in the job.Nicky eventually sells off Garriga's REAL algorithm not only to McEwen, but to every other race team as well for the same price, amounting to about 27 million Euros. He also convinces Jess to run away with him. Before they can escape, one of Garriga's men rams his car into theirs, and the two of them are abducted and taken to one of Garriga's warehouses with duct tape on their mouths. He takes the tape off Nicky's mouth but leaves it on Jess and plugs her nose until Nicky tells him how he managed to hack Garriga's system and get his hands on the real algorithm. First Nicky tells him Jess wasn't a part of it so he can let her go. Garriga plugs her nose again, so Nicky finally admits that he used Jess (again), and planted a bug on her so that when she returned to Garriga's hotel room, the bug picked up his computer password. He laughs, knowing it's a lie, and takes the tape off her mouth. She admits to Nicky that Garriga isn't her boyfriend - she just wanted his watch, which is worth two hundred grand. She's never slept with Garriga, or even been to his room, despite his numerous attempts. Nicky finally resigns to telling the truth, and right as he's about to start, he gets shot in the chest by Owens, which horrifies Garriga and causes him to leave. Nicky appears to bleed out as Jess cries and tells him she loves him. It looks like Nicky dies until Owens says he shot Nicky in the right spot to avoid any major arteries, although he did puncture his lung. Owens gets the blood out of Nicky's lung, reviving him. Owens then calls Nicky ""Mellow"", making Jess realize that Owens is Nicky's father, Bucky Spurgeon, that he was in on the con the whole time, and that they've just performed the ""Toledo Panic Button.""Owens drives Nicky and Jess to the closest hospital. He reminds Nicky of what he said regarding putting your heart in the con game, and adds that he's taking all the money. Jess helps walk Nicky to the front of the hospital.

At a charity event for the orphanage where he and his wife both grew up, Billy is taunted by an up-and-coming boxer, Miguel ""Magic"" Escobar, leading to a brawl in which Maureen is accidentally shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector, who flees.Billy begins abusing alcohol and drugs while obsessively searching for Hector. He eventually gets a tip of his whereabouts, but finds only his drug-addict wife Maria (Rita Ora), and leaves after learning Hector is a father. After attacking a referee out of frustration after losing a fight, Billy is suspended and left indebted, leading to his house and belongings being repossessed. He continues to spiral out of control and nearly dies after crashing his car while driving intoxicated, which also causes him to lose custody of Leila, who is put under care of Child Protective Services officer Angela Rivera (Naomie Harris). The incident drives Billy to become sober, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament.At the behest of friends, Billy gets a job at a gym owned by seasoned boxer, Titus ""Tick"" Wills (Forest Whitaker), and eventually convinces Tick to become his trainer. Billy's former manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent), who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.Leila is reluctant to forgive her father, but she is allowed to watch the fight by closed circuit in the locker room with Angela. As the match begins, Miguel has the upper hand against Billy, but, with Tick's advice, Billy has the chance to turn the tables in the final round by using the Philly shell defense and countering more aggressively with his left. As the round reaches its final minute, Billy pivots hard and, although fighting from a traditional stance, delivers a powerful left uppercut (southpaw, from which the film takes its title) which sends the champion down to the ground. Miguel manages to get up before the count is over and is saved by the bell. Billy is declared the winner by a split-decision and reunites with Leila in the locker room, where she forgives his past mistakes and they embrace."

He taps the wall and finds a hollow point to drill through. The drill gets pulled into the wall, creating a huge hole. Boyd sticks his arm in there and gets pulled against the wall. The drill starts to make holes closer to Boyd's face until he is let go with a red mark on his arm. He looks back at the wall with no hole and back to his arm with no mark.Boyd runs back downstairs with everyone else, now definitely believing their story.

The team and family get contact with Maddie through the TV again, until the poltergeists push the TV and break it. Eric goes into Maddie's room and smashes through the wall with a table leg, and then shoves a huge part of the table through the wall. This opens a portal from the closet to the living room ceiling. Brooke then decides she needs to call in the only person she knows who can stop this.She calls in Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), the host of a paranormal investigation series, and her ex-husband. Carrigan suggests that Maddie has a gift that allows her to communicate with the spirits, and her purity is the key for the spirits to move forward. Although Eric is hesitant to trust Carrigan, he knows he has no other choice if he wants to get Maddie back.Together, they throw a rope through the closet and out the ceiling to make a chain with which to bring Maddie back. Carrigan uses one of Griffin's toy drones to fly in with a camera for a sign of Maddie. The drone flies through the portal, giving everyone a view of the house, infested with countless spirits. The drone eventually finds Maddie, who hears her family and calls to them. Three spirits pull her back, alerting everyone. As the adults argue as to who should go in, Griffin runs upstairs and goes to save Maddie himself. He goes through the portal and finds Maddie. The poltergeists pull the rope and throw it through the other end. Griffin takes Maddie and runs toward the exit. The two of them fall from the opening of the ceiling. Their parents revive them and embrace them.The family starts to pack their bags after thanking Carrigan, believing the house is clean. Maddie says it's NOT clean, despite Amy thinking she helped get the spirits toward the light. Maddie says she didn't since she was pulled out before they could go. Eric starts to drive the family out until the poltergeists attack again and push the car through the house. They begin to pull Maddie back toward the closet. The family runs over to save her. The spirits then emerge in their ghoulish forms to pull Maddie back themselves. Carrigan then commands the spirits to retreat and leave the family alone. He knows what he must do to stop this. He runs up to the room and allows the family to escape while he gets pulled into the portal himself. The Bowens retreat in Sophie's car and drive away. Maddie then sees a beam of light burst from the house, suggesting the spirits have moved onto another realm.In the aftermath, the team tries to find a sign of Carrigan. After spotting nothing for a while, they find a signal near the bottom of the house.The Bowens start to look for a new home. They visit one house that the realtor describes as having big closet space. After seeing the big tree outside and other reasons not to stay, the Bowens leave and decide to just get out of town.Shortly after the credits start, we see Carrigan (alive and well) in his show, only with Brooke joining him.

Later on, the two are expecting their child, which Maximilian wants to name Jupiter. Aleksa isn't too fond of the name.

Caine bursts in and kills the doctors as they reveal their Keeper form. He gets Jupiter out of there.Jupiter finds herself atop the Willis Tower. Caine explains to her that he is a genetically-engineered being made up of a splice between a human and a wolf. Jupiter asks why she was almost just killed, and Caine tells her that she is the rightful owner of the planet. He claims that human life began not on Earth but on another planet called Orus. Jupiter also has no memory of the Keepers finding her and her taking a picture of them, which Caine explains as them erasing her memory. They are beamed up by a spaceship hovering over them, when the bounty hunters show up and destroy the ship. Caine carries Jupiter as they fly over the city with his hover boots as the bounty hunters chase after them. Jupiter falls in the attack, but Caine catches her before she hits the ground. Caine hijacks a small ship and escapes with Jupiter.Caine and Jupiter drive away from the city, where Caine continues to explain the history of the Abrasax family. They have been splicing humans with other animals for ages, and are responsible for events such as the extinction of the dinosaurs. The two drive up to the home of Caine's former comrade Stinger Apini (Sean Bean), who is spliced with a bee. Stinger lives with his ailing daughter. He and Caine were once skyjackers, but were dismissed following an incident, and now Stinger resents Caine. The two fight for a little, when a swarm of bees appears.

Kalique says she is 14,000 years old, and her mother was 90,000 when she was murdered. Kalique walks into a bath and sheds her older image to a more youthful appearance. Stinger then shows up with the Aegis, led by Captain Diomika Tsing (Nikki Amuka-Bird).

She goes through several windows with an android lawyer until she is printed with a tattoo on her wrist and officially allowed to claim ownership of Earth. In the meantime, Jupiter attempts to sort of flirt with Caine. He thinks he isn't good for her and compares himself to a dog, even though Jupiter claims to love dogs.Titus and his people take in Jupiter and apprehend Caine as Stinger hands them over to him in exchange for currency to help his ailing daughter. Titus and Jupiter have dinner together. Titus deduces that Jupiter has fallen in love with Caine, yet he still proposes to her. Afterwards, he shows Jupiter a room filled with thousands of vials that contain youth serums made from harvesting hundreds of dead humans. Jupiter is horrified by this realization.Caine is imprisoned and placed in a chamber by Titus and his people. He plans to kill Jupiter after marrying her so that he can get his claim to Earth. Caine is expelled into space with his hands cuffed behind him. He uses his hover boots to burn the handcuffs off and grab a floating pack that contains a spacesuit that automatically forms itself around Caine's body and saves him from suffocation. He only has 40 minutes of oxygen, but the Aegis emerge from hyperspace and rescue him.The wedding is about to take place. Titus has his ring printed on his finger during the ceremony. Jupiter nearly has hers printed on when Caine comes crashing in on a ship into the cathedral. He comes up to the platform where Jupiter and Titus are and informs Jupiter that Titus plans to kill her.

His lizard-rat hybrid henchman Sargorn (Neil Fingleton) is sent to Earth with his team of lizard-rat men to break into the home of Jupiter's family and capture them. Jupiter goes home and realizes this, forcing her to return to deep space and save her family.Jupiter arrives at a mining facility on the planet where Balem resides. The Aegis are close behind her but are unable to enter because the planet is protected by a shield. Jupiter is brought before Balem, who shows her the family in the floor beneath them as they are floating and sleeping in stasis, while the henchmen get ready to splice into them. Using a special contract, Balem orders Jupiter to sign over her rights to rule over Earth if she wants her family to live. Realizing that either way, she and her family would die since Balem would harvest them on Earth, she refuses and smashes the contract.With the help of Stinger, Caine breaches the planet's shield. Tsing informs him his mission could get him killed, but she adds that he is tremendously courageous. Caine breaks into Balem's facility and kills the lizard-rat people to save Jupiter's family. He pulls Jupiter out with a device that opens a hole beneath her to get her away from Balem. Outside, the facility starts to destabilize and collapse. Caine fights Sargorn while Balem tries to kill Jupiter himself. Caine kills Sargorn by pushing him into the hole he made and removing the device to close the hole around Sargorn's neck, crushing it.Jupiter's family is taken to safety while Jupiter fights back against Balem. Balem believes Jupiter is his mother reincarnated, and he admits that he murdered his mother, claiming that she told him she hated her life and wanted him to kill her. Jupiter shoots Balem once in the leg and whacks him across the face with a bar. The platform beneath them breaks slightly. Balem is unable to hold on and he plummets to his death. Jupiter falls but is rescued by Caine. With the help of the Aegis, everyone is able to escape the crumbling facility and get out safely.Jupiter and her family are taken back home, with their memories erased of their capture or any interaction with evil lizard-rat people. Jupiter continues to go about her work and has made breakfast and coffee for her family. They surprise her by bringing out the brass telescope she wanted. She then tells the family that she has a date. They all press her with questions like ""Is he Russian?""Jupiter joins Caine on the roof of another building. He has his wings restored to his back after his heroic deeds, and she has gotten hover boots of her own. Jupiter decides not to tell her family that she basically owns Earth. The two of them kiss and take flight over the city."

Kate Macer leads a Phoenix based kidnap response unit for the FBI. Following Kate's team leading a raid on a known drug den in nearby Chandler, Kate is recruited to work on a special ops team led by Matt Graver of the CIA, he who is on special assignment for the Department of Defense. They recruited her because they wanted someone with tactical procedures knowledge. Outwardly, the team's mission, which works behind a Delta Force team as its primary gun power as required, is to decapitate a Mexican drug cartel by capturing or dismembering the workings of the main players, cartel head Manuel Díaz, his second in command Guillermo Díaz (Manuel's brother), and drug lord Fausto Alarcón.

In Mexico, the word means ""hit-man"".In Chandler, Arizona, a SWAT team advances on a house where they suspect hostages are being held by Mexican Sinoloa cartel leader Manuel Diaz (Bernardo P. Sacarino). Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an American FBI agent in charge of the kidnapping response team, and her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluyya), crash through the front of the house with their van. They capture several suspects and when a man tries to shoot Kate, she kills him. They observe a head wrapped in plastic inside a hole caused by the bad guy's weapon. A forensic team takes the house apart and finds 42 bodies hidden in the walls with bags over their heads in various stages of decay.Kate's superior Dave Jennings (Victor Garber) calls her inside. Two officers find a padlocked hatch in the floor of a shed outside. When they open it, a bomb explodes, killing two officers. Kate is traumatized and wounded.At the FBI offices in Phoenix, Kate meets Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). He is in charge of an operation to catch Diaz. Kate is invited to join the team as an advisor, and she agrees to volunteer so she can help catch the men responsible for the deaths she witnessed that day.In Mexico, Silvio (Maximiliano Hernandez) is in bed. His son tells him that he has a soccer match later that day. Silvio eats breakfast and wears his police uniform as he walks to his car.On board the federal jet for the flight, she meets a mysterious Spanish-speaking man who introduces himself as Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). The team arrives in El Paso. They are warned during a briefing that they may be the target of a hit squad when returning to the U.S. the border crossing. She learns that Alejandro was a prosecutor from Cartagena, Colombia. In Mexico, they spot a police car who is not part of their team, pacing them on a parallel street, apparently acting as a spotter.They drive up to the crowded U.S. entry station and are held up by long lines. Alejandro spots two cars nearby filled with suspicious individuals. He alerts everyone on their team in the nearby cars. The cops slowly move out of their vehicles and approach the gang members. One of them gets out of their car slowly as well, gun in hand. The officers tell him to lower his weapon, but he raises his weapon, and he and everyone else in the car is quickly killed. One of the gang members in the other car also draws his weapon and he and the others in the car are killed. Kate also shoots a bandit sneaking up on her vehicle.On the U.S. side of the border, they enter a prison. Kate argues with Matt about shooting the individuals on the Mexican side of the border, as well as the way the mission is being conducted. Matt watches Alejandro torture Guillermo. The two men have a history. Outside, the stress causes Kate to start smoking again.The team drives to Tucson to question Mexican illegal aliens who have been removed from transport buses returning them to Mexico. Alejandro wants to talk to the individuals apprehended near Nogales. They question the men to determine to identify the location of a secret tunnel under the border that Guillermo revealed to them.At a hotel room, Alejandro speaks with several illegal immigrants and gets them to identify the location of the tunnel entrance.The team surveils a bank where they believe they will find a woman who has been depositing money tied to the Mexican drug cartels. They arrest the woman and in their search, the team finds bags of money intended to be laundered and wrapped in blue-pink wristbands. The bank manager shows the Feds that the cartels have been repaying $17 million in fictitious loans, which are not reported. Kate wants to arrest Diaz, but Matt won't let her. Kate wants to make a case to prosecute, but even her boss doesn't agree with her.Reggie and Kate go out for for drinks that night. Reggie introduces Kate to an acquaintance, Ted (Jon Bernthal), a off duty Phoenix cop. After a few drinks, Kate goes to her apartment with Ted to have sex. Then she sees a wristband with his keys like ones they found around the money earlier that day. Kate tries to get away, but they struggle and she reaches for her weapon. Ted strangles Kate until Alejandro walks in and points his gun in Ted's face, making him release Kate.Ted is arrested and placed in the police vehicle. Matt threatens Ted and his daughter. Alejandro beats him until Ted tells him what he knows about Diaz and other corrupt U.S. cops. The team succeeds in taking away a substantial amount of money from Diaz's account, forcing him to make his return to Mexico.Matt decides to attack the tunnel to force the drug cartel to react. They gear up and head towards the tunnel. Matt tells Kate to stay out of the way. She is only there because the CIA needs a U.S. agent attached to a domestic agency to work within the U.S.The team enters the tunnel at night. Alejandro and the Delta Force team lead a running gun battle with the smugglers and mules inside. Kate and Reggie follow nervously. On the Mexican side Alejandro observes Silvio unloading drugs from his police vehicle in a warehouse above the tunnel entrance. Kate sees Alejandro apprehend Silvio and hold him at gunpoint. Kate attempts to stop Alejandro, but he shoots her purposefully in her vest and tells her to never aim a weapon at him again. He takes Silvio and forces him into in his police car. He gives Silvio directions while coordinating with the Americans.Back on the American side of the border, Kate is the last person out of the tunnel. She angrily punches Matt but he calms her down. She learns that Alejandro is not a Mexican federal agent, but an assassin originally a member of the Colombian Cartel. He has been hired by the CIA to catch Diaz's boss, Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo), the local head of the Mexican Sinaloa cartel. The Mexican Sinaloa cartel decapitated Alejandro's wife and threw their daughter into a vat of acid. The CIA thinks they can control drugs better if the Colombians are in charge.Alejandro forces Silvio to drive until they see Diaz's car. Alejandro makes Silvio pull Diaz over and tells Silvio to order Diaz to step out of the car. Silvio walks out to confront Diaz, when Alejandro shoots Silvio in the back, killing him, and wounds Diaz in the leg. He forces Diaz to drive to his boss's (Alarcon's) house.Alejandro arrives at Fausto's palatial, gated estate and kills all the guards outside and in the house. He exits the house and finds Fausto having dinner with his wife and two sons on the patio. He aims his gun at Fausto and tells the wife and boys to continue eating and to stay calm. Fausto tells Alejandro that his wife wouldn't like what he's become, a lawyer-turned-hit-man. Alejandro brings up his daughter. Fausto says it was nothing personal, but Alejandro says it is for him. He tells Fausto in Spanish, ""Time to meet God"". He kills his wife and two sons, to Fausto's horror. Alejandro tells him to finish his meal, and then kills Fausto.Alejandro slips into Kate's apartment unseen late at night. He hands her a document and orders her to sign it, confirming that everything they did was by-the-book. Kate refuses to sign it. Alejandro holds a gun under her chin, stating she'll be committing suicide if she doesn't sign. He wipes tears away from her cheeks while never removing the gun. Kate reluctantly signs. Alejandro leaves and tells her to go to a smaller town where the rules of law still apply. Kate grabs her gun and as he walks away, aims it at him from her balcony. He turns around and waits for her to pull the trigger, but she just slowly lowers it and lets him walk away.In Mexico, Silvio's son stands over his father's empty bedside, almost as if he knows his father won't be coming home. His mother takes him to his soccer match. During the game, everybody hears gunshots in the distance. They quickly carry on with the game."
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638355/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons. In the 1960s with the Cold War in play, CIA agent Napoleon Solo successfully helps Gaby Teller defect to West Germany despite the intimidating opposition of KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Later, all three unexpectedly find themselves working together in a joint mission to stop a private criminal organization from using Gaby's father's scientific expertise to construct their own nuclear bomb. Through clenched teeth and stylish poise, all three must find a way to cooperate for the sake of world peace, even as they each pursue their own agendas.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In the 60's, the CIA agent Napoleon Solo is assigned to bring the mechanic Gaby Teller from East Berlin to the other side of the wall. Gaby is the daughter of the scientist and American collaborator Udo Teller that defected from German at the end of WWII and now has vanished. They are chased by KGB agent Illya Kuryakin but they succeed to escape. Soon Napoleon Solo's chief Saunders discloses that Gaby's uncle Rudi works for the wealthy Alexander and his wife Victoria Vinciguerra and Udo might be secretly building a nuclear weapon for them. Napoleon Solo is forced to team-up with Illya and Gaby and they go to Rome to investigate.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin, band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist's daughter, Gaby, to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren't all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren't sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.—grantss 1963. Napoleon Solo is a suave and urbane C.I.A. agent. He was once a criminal, but the C.I.A. believed his unique talents would be of better service to the country as a spy than they would be if he was behind bars. His current case is to locate Dr. Udo Teller, a famed German rocket scientist who had been working for the Americans on their nuclear program since the end of WWII until he disappeared without a trace two years ago, that is until he was recently photographed in Rome. Napoleon manages to smuggle Teller's biological daughter, Gaby Schmidt, out of East Berlin to the west in order to locate Teller. The Americans don't believe she knows anything about his whereabouts - her father who she has not seen or heard from in eighteen years - but that she can influence some who do, namely her Uncle Rudi who is an executive at Rome-based Vinciguerra Shipping, owned and operated by husband and wife Alexander and Victoria Vinceguerra. The company is purportedly the front for the development of nuclear weapons, the major national intelligence agencies suspecting that Victoria, the brains behind the operation, having kidnapped Teller to build her an atom bomb. Because of the global implications, Napoleon is forced to work on this case with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin. Beyond the east-west divide between the Americans and Soviets, Napoleon will have a difficult time working with his new partner due to their recent not so pleasant encounter in East Berlin, and Illya's volatile and violent temper, which can cloud what he does professionally. As Napoleon, Illya and Gaby work on the case - their success or failure which may determine world order - what happens is affected by other players in the picture which they do not know about, and the Americans and Soviets working arguably on their own different agendas.—Huggo 1963, West Berlin.Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) makes his way through checkpoint Charlie from West to East Berlin, but notices he's being followed by a man we'll later discover is Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer). Solo goes to a chop shop garage where he meets Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander). Gaby's father is being forced to build an atom bomb for the Nazis. Solo's mission is to get her out of Berlin so they can find her uncle Rudi (Sylvester Groth) and have him set up a meeting between her and her dad.As they make their way to the border they're chased by Kuryakin, who turns out to be Solo's match. However, Solo has help. Waiting on the other side of the wall is a CIA truck that shoots a zip line up to the roof where Solo and Gaby end up. They're able to zip line over the Berlin wall. Kuryakin is right behind them but the truck backs up making slack in the line and leaving Illya on the other side of the wall.There is a flashback to Kuryakin's briefing on Solo.Solo came to Europe during the second world war but stayed there and became a master art thief. He was eventually captured but the CIA felt his skills were too good to be wasted in a prison, so they recruited him.In the present, CIA specialist Sanders (Jared Harris) meets with Solo at a park. In the restroom he lays out the mission. While at the urinal he says, ""What I'm going to feed you might be bitter."" It's innuendo, but nevertheless, it's true. It's Illya Kuryakin! They fight and Kuryakin overcomes Solo. The KGB director Oleg (Misha Kuznetsov) comes in and tells Kury, ""Don't kill your partner on your first day."" Solo asks what that means. Sanders translates. Solo says he understands the words, but what does that mean. The CIA and KGB have struck a deal and are sending Solo and Kury on a joint mission.They have to go to Rome where Kury will pose as Gaby's fiancé and Solo as an antiquities dealer. They believe a family business there that Gaby's uncle Rudi works for is a front. The business has been in Alexander's (Luca Calvani) family but actually his wife Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki) is the brains behind the operation.Kury and Solo get to know each other by revealing what they've discovered in each others files. Solo triggers Kury's rage issues, but the Russian manages to keep them in check.Meanwhile, a man named Waverly (Hugh Grant) checks into the hotel in Rome right before Napoleon does. When Napoleon checks in, he notices a couple of guys who are clearly evil henchmen in the lobby. He has his bags brought to his room but he takes off.On the streets of Rome Kury and Gaby bond a little. Solo shows up and tells Kury that he's going to get mugged. To convince the bad guys that he's really a Russian architect, his cover, and not a super bad-ass secret agent, his instructions are to ""be a pussy""; just get mugged and don't fight back. The mugging happens and even though the thugs take Kury's father's watch and Gaby's engagement ring he manages to suppress his rage and submit. Solo pops up and they all go back to the hotel.Solo and the hotel desk clerk drink champagne and wind up in bed. Meanwhile, in the ""engaged couple"" room, Gaby chugs vodka and tries to get Kury to dance with her. He won't so she slaps him and they start wrestling. She passes out and he tucks her into bed.In the morning Solo discovers about a dozen monitoring bugs in his room. He goes to Kury's room and hands them to him telling him that they're Russian-made. Kury hands Solo about a dozen bugs too and says that they're American-made.Kury meets Gaby in front of the hotel and gives her a brand new engagement ring.Solo heads to a party that Victoria is throwing. On the way in he literally bumps into Waverly. We later find out that he picks Waverly's pocket and steals his invitation. Solo crashes the party and gets in a fight with security because he doesn't present an invitation. Victoria takes notice and Solo shows his invitation. He manages to ""lift"" her necklace and another woman's bracelet. Victoria asks how he got an invitation and who he is. He says his name is Deveny and that he specializes in filling the gaps in people's collections. He gives her the bracelet and the necklace.Gaby and Kury are also at the party. Rudi disses Kury by wondering if Gaby is slumming it like ""a racehorse with a work horse"". Kury goes into a bathroom but three young Italian aristocrats prevent from using the sink and tell him to use the ladies' washroom instead. He finally gives in to his anger and roughs them up. Alexander takes a keen liking to Gaby right away.Back at the hotel Kury has locked himself in the bathroom which he has turned into a dark room and is developing film. His camera was able to pick up on radiation on clothing at the party. Therefore, Gaby's father must be near and working on that atom bomb. Both Solo and Kury say that they'll sleep on this new information, but ...... in the next shot they both break into the company's factory in the middle of the night. While Kury is clearly the muscles between the two of them, Solo is more cunning and manages to break into a large bank-style safe. It's empty except for a centrifuge used for enhancing uranium. Solo thought that model of safe didn't have an alarm. Wrong! They escape by jumping out of a window and onto a boat. Solo falls off and swims to a dock where he finds a truck. Inside is the driver's dinner which he casually eats while Kury gets chased in circles by guards on a well-armed boat. They blow up Kury's boat. Solo drives away but has second thoughts. He returns, crashes his truck onto the bad guys' boat, and then rescues a drowning Kury.Victoria sees that the safe has been opened and calls Solo's hotel room. No answer. Rudi calls Gaby and asks to apologize to Kury, but she says he's asleep. She then calls room 304 to tell the person on the other end that the meeting is confirmed. Victoria and her goons race to the hotel, but Solo and Kury get there first. She and Solo get it on in his room (807).The next morning, Kury awkwardly turns on a tracker that's on Gaby's garter belt. (Lots of sexual tension there).Gaby meets with her uncle and says that she knows her father is there and that he works for him. Rudi asks how she knows. We don't hear her answer just yet. Instead, we see Kury, who's monitoring from afar, start running.Solo meets with Victoria. He pours himself a drink, but she's drugged it. He wakes up strapped to an electric torture chair. Rudi is an evil Nazi scientist who keeps a scrapbook of all the horrific stuff he's done. He has a blank page just waiting for Solo. Fortunately, there's a short in the electric chair. Kury rescues Solo and straps Rudi into the chair. He tells them that the warhead is already built. Kury and Solo step out of the room to debate what to do with Rudi. In the background, the short in the electric chair fixes itself and Rudi gets electrocuted to the point of bursting in flames.Gaby is brought to an island where her dad is working. She slaps him and tells him to finish the job. Alexander and Victoria seem happy with this.Meanwhile, Waverly (who turns out to be a member of the British Intelligence) informs Solo and Kury about the situation. The Brits knew that it was only a matter of time before someone grabbed Gaby to try to get her dad to finish the atom bomb. They assumed it would be the Nazis. They were surprised that it was the Russians and the Americans. So Gaby has been working undercover with the British this whole time. She gains the trust of the bad guys by telling them that Kury and Solo are secret agents. She knew that her new engagement ring would have a bug in it and that Kury would be listening. Solo says that he thinks the British were working with her, but now that they've lost her, they need the American and the Russians help.Kury and Solo are both told by their respective superiors to get the warhead and the disc with professor Teller's research. Also, to kill the other if necessary.On the island, Gaby and her dad try to switch lenses on the warhead but Victoria notices. There is also a second warhead. She orders Gaby be put in a cell and tells her father to finish, with the threat of her death. He does, but Victoria takes his disc and the backup he had hidden, then shoots him.Time for a super-stylized and ultra-cool breaking-in montage as Solo and Kury storm the island. During it, Solo finds Kury's father's watch on a guard and grabs it. They find that Gaby and the warhead on the far side of the island in a jeep being driven by Alexander. Solo chases in a dune buggy while Kury is on a motorcycle. The vehicles all crash. Alexander and Kury fight and Kury stabs him in the head with his knife. Turns out though, this is the wrong bomb! Victoria disappeared with the right one.Solo remembers that Alexander's family used a fishing boat to smuggle gold for the Nazis. He also remembers the name of the boat from an old childhood photo of Alexander. They radio the boat and Solo taunts Victoria about the way her husband died. They stay on the radio long enough for the good guys to track the boat. Turns out that the two lenses that were in the bombs make it so that one bomb can take out the other. They launch the decoy bomb and blow up Victoria, the Atom bomb and the fishing boat.Gaby apologizes to Kury and returns the engagement ring. He tells her to keep it so that he can know if she ever needs him. Kury's boss tells him that the professor's disc wasn't destroyed but that Solo has it. Kury goes to his room. Solo pours drinks for the two of them. Kury sees the disc and is filling with rage. Solo gives him the watch and reveals the disc. They both decide to destroy it. Waverly and Gaby show up. Waverly says that he's decided to keep the group together and that they have a new code-name: UNCLE. (United Network Command for Law and Enforcement).Over the end credits we see everyone's dossiers. In one little detail, Gaby is currently learning to speak Russian."
Spotlight,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. When the Boston Globe's tenacious ""Spotlight"" team of reporters delves into allegations of abuse in the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation uncovers a decades-long cover-up at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishment, touching off a wave of revelations around the world.—Open Road In existence since the 1970s, Spotlight is the investigative reporting unit of the Boston Globe. They can spend months or years on a single story, which they choose amongst themselves. As such, they are somewhat autonomous from the rest of the newspaper, only needing to report to their superior. As a rule, they are not to discuss their work with anyone else, whether it be other staff, friends and or family. In 2001, the four person team consisted of its editorWalter Robinson- Robby to his friends - and his team of three investigative journalists,Michael Rezendes,Sacha Pfeifferand Matt Carroll. Robby reports to the assistant managing editor,Ben Bradlee Jr.. Upon his arrival from his most recent position in Florida, Marty Baron, the newly appointed editor-in-chief. Mr. Baron requests Spotlight to place their current project on hold and dig deeper into a recent story written by fellow Globe reporter and columnist Eileen McNamara, regarding allegations against a Catholic priest of sexual abuse of a minor and what appears to be the subsequent cover-up by the head of the Archdiocese of Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law. They are at first hesitant to work on the story, seeing Baron as an outsider to Boston, he who doesn't understand what is important to locals. Baron's outsider status includes not being born and raised there, and not being Catholic (he being the Globe's first Jewish editor-in-chief). Spotlights first task is to see if they can get some court documents on the case unsealed, which means they will need a court order. The Church and its parishioners could falsely interpret this as The Globe suing the Catholic church. This could have major, negative consequences for The Globe due to the fact that a majority of their subscribers are Catholic. Robby and his team begin by speaking to lawyers who have or are working on alleged sexual abuse cases perpetrated by Catholic priests in and immediately surrounding Boston (those lawyers said including Eric MacLeish andMitchell Garabedian), known victims (such asPhil Saviano, the head of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP)) and insiders in the Catholic church. Through this investigation, they get wind that the problem is not contained to a couple of priests and few victims, in essence changing the focus from the priest(s) to the systemic problem of the Archdiocese not only covering up the abuse but in reality doing nothing to stop it and thus condoning it. Their goal is not only the end product of an important story, but making sure that the other major local newspapers, such as the Boston Herald, do not beat them to the scant outline of the story in the public consciousness which the Catholic church could easily quash. Through it all, they may come to some unpleasant realizations that not only the Archdiocese and the Catholic church in general are to blame for what happened.—Huggo In 2001, editor Marty Baron of The Boston Globe assigns a team of journalists to investigate allegations against John Geoghan, an unfrocked priest accused of molesting more than 80 boys. Led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, reportersMichael Rezendes, Matt Carroll andSacha Pfeifferinterview victims and try to unseal sensitive documents. The reporters make it their mission to provide proof of a cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church.—Jwelch5742 In 2001, the Jewish editor Marty Baron is hired by The Boston Globe and he asks the Spotlight team to investigate the priest John Geoghan that was accused of abusing children and the lawyer Mitchell Garabedian that has told that Cardinal Law knew what his priest did. Walter 'Robby' Robinson, Mike Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer and Matt Carroll are fully supported by Baron and their leader Ben Bradlee, Jr. to set in motion the investigation of the priest and they contact the initially reluctant Garabedian; the lawyer Eric Macleish that has defended many victims; the leader of the victims' rights organization Phil Saviano; and several victims that accept to meet them. After one year investigation, they confirm the names of twenty pedophile priests in Boston and they publish the story showing that Cardinal Law had prior knowledge of the priests' abuse of children—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The opening shot shows the text: BASED ON ACTUAL EVENTS.Boston, Massachusetts, 1976At a police station, an older cop tells a younger one that the woman is hysterical, that she is divorced with four kids and that Father Geoghan was helping out. In an interview room, the Monsignor is talking to a distraught woman fingering rosary beads while her three children color with crayons. The young cop is told nobody can discuss this case with the papers and that the case isn't going to be arraigned.Boston. July, 2001It is the Boston Globe newsroom. A reporter named Stewart is retiring to be replaced by a new editor. Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) gives a playful speech about his departure. Another reporter, Mike (Mark Ruffalo) carries a piece of cake downstairs to the Spotlight department, a small office with only two others on staff -- Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They are the investigative team for the Boston Globe, all working so hard on a story, they have to eat the cake for their lunch. They mention how sad it is to see Stewart go to a bigger paper and mention many others are leaving the company. The new boss that is coming on Monday is said to have cut a lot of people from the paper he ran in Miami; they worry he's going to phase out Spotlight. Nobody has met him yet but Robby is going to have lunch with him.We cut to that lunch meeting. Marty Baron (Liev Schrieber) is reading 'The Curse of the Bambino' while he waits for Robby. When Robby suggests Marty check out a Red Sox game, Marty explains he's actually not a baseball fan but just trying to get a feel for his new city. He asks about Spotlight, which Robby explains is a four-person team that does investigative that reports to Ben Bradlee Jr. They just finished a story on a negligent construction site and are looking for a new story. Marty asks how long it takes and Robby says it can take weeks or up to a year because they don't like to rush things. Marty asks what they are working on now but Robby tells him all their investigation has been on their new editor since everyone is concerned about losing their job. Marty notes this is understandable as the Internet is making classifieds obsolete and they're losing revenue. Robby asks if this is why he asked about Spotlight but Marty tells him he had another reason.The next day, Robby attends a 10:30 AM meeting where Marty is first introduced to the staff. He asks them if they've read Eileen McNamara's column about the Geoghan case. They're only vaguely familiar so he tells them it's about a Catholic priest that molested many children in six different parishes over the last 30 years. The lawyer for the victims, Mr. Garabedian, said that Cardinal Law found out about it 15 years earlier and did nothing. The cardinal denies this but the lawyer claims he has documents to prove it. He says they should write a story on this since it's only been in their paper twice in the last six months. Robby points out the documents are sealed but Marty tells him they can take the church to court for access. Ben confirms that he is suggesting they sue the Catholic Church. Marty says technically all they're doing is filing a motion to lift the seals on this documents. Ben points out everyone will still consider this suing the church. Marty isn't worried.In Ben's office, Ben and Robby update Mike on Marty's suggestion to sue for the sealed documents in the Geoghan case. Eileen, who has written the article, gives them the lowdown on the people involved. The judge on the case is Catholic so they aren't hopeful she will rule in their favor. Marty suggests Spotlight take the story since it's now an investigative report.Robby tells the Spotlight group about their new story -- not just the Geoghan case but that Cardinal Law knew about the allegations and covered it up to protect the corrupt Catholic Church and the Vactican's reputation. They decide to investigate Geoghan, as well as Eric MacLeish, the lawyer for the victims of molestation by another priest a decade earlier. Mike decides to meet with Mr. Garabedian, who's reaping the current victims. He's told he is a personality which doesn't faze Mike... he likes personalities.The next day, Mike is kept waiting when he goes to Mr. Garabedian's office. He is ignored. Sacha and Robby visit Eric MacLeish (Billy Crudup), a handsome lawyer. They ask if Eric's been following the Geoghan case and he mentions the 80 plaintiffs with all individual cases (not a class action suit). Eric points out the molestation cases are ""all shitty"" because the statute of limitation is only three years and most victims don't come forward until they're adults -- because of shame and guilt and they come from tough neighborhoods where they don't want other kids to know they were molested. And the charitable immunity statute caps damages at $20,000, which astonishes Robby. Eric says they should try the cases through the press, like he did years earlier. But he adds that most of the victims are afraid to be publicly interviewed -- he knows because he represented some of the victims. Eric tells them that his settling of the cases resulted in nothing more than acknowledgment of their victimhood by the bishop and a few thousand dollars. He suggests Mr. Garabedian doesn't really have sealed documents -- he's just bluffing to get a better deal. They think that would be risky but he believes Mitch Garabedian would do that and asks if they've met him.We now meet Mr. Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) when Mike sneaks into his office as a client leaves. Mike reminds him of their appointment but Mr. Garabedian tries to blow him off, telling him the Phoenix is writing an article on him. Mike tells him he's following up on the article Eileen McNamara wrote about his suit he is told there are 86 individual suits, it's not one large one. Mr. Garabedian tells him he can't show him the documents because they're under seal. The church is trying to get him disbarred and he doesn't want to be speaking to Mike or to be on the record in any shape, even handwritten notes. Garabedian tells him he's already talked to the Phoenix but Mike tells him nobody reads the Phoenix but the Globe still has power. If they cover the story, it will be read by everyone -- they're just as powerful as the Catholic Church. Mike asks if he can interview some of the victims. Garabedian tells him he needs to think about it and to call him tomorrow.At the Globe, Marty meets with Richard Gilman and tells him about challenging the protective order in the Geoghan case. Gilman points out that their subscriber base is a majority Catholic but okays the lawsuit. Down in the Spotlights office, a woman brings clippings on past reports regarding the case. Sacha mentions an organization for survivors of priest molestation called SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests). It's run by a man named Phil Saviano. Matt finds a clip from their Religion column that mentions another priest molesting kids in Ohio and then being moved to Boston where he did the same thing. It wasn't Cardinal Law who swept it under the rug -- it was another cardinal. They now see a pattern that when these men are found molesting kids, they are quickly moved to another parish. The article mentions Jim Sullivan, a friend of Robby's, defended the priest.Robby meets with Jim and his wife for dinner. He asks about the priest that Jim represented and whether the cardinals covered it up. Jim says he can't talk about the case, even off the record.Sacha attends church with her very Catholic grandmother, a bit torn now that she's learning more about the cardinal covering up the molestations. She looks at all the young children singing in the choir and is unnerved. At the Globe, Mike continues trying to reach out to Garabedian. Marty meets with Cardinal Law who says he looks forward to working with the Globe. When Marty tells him, they are best to perform without the church's influence, the Cardinal mentions how another paper lost a lot of subscribers when the church disagreed with their stance on a topic. A secretary comes in and gives Marty a gift -- 'The Catechism of the Catholic Church.' (Marty is Jewish.)The Spotlight team meets with Phil Saviano, who runs SNAP. He tells them when he was 11, he was preyed upon by a priest. He asks if any of them are Catholic. They all were raised Catholic but none of them are very religious now. Saviano tells them, ""When a parish priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal. It's like God asking you for help. So one day, when he asks for a hand job, you give it to him. This is not just physical abuse but spiritual abuse because it robs you of your faith. You're ashamed and many end up becoming alcoholics or drug addicts or killing themselves -- hence why the organization is for survivors.""He tells them about a book written on a case in Louisiana and suggests talking to Richard Sipe, a former priest who worked at a treatment center, where priests are sent when they get caught. He tells them he sent all this information to the Globe about five years ago and they never ran the story. He was shocked because the story was big -- not just Boston but the whole country, even up to the Vatican. He knows of at least eight Catholic priests in Boston alone who have molested children.Robby and Mike join Ben at a baseball game with Ben Bradlee and a reporter. They mention meeting with Saviano. Ben and the reporter know him because he sent hundreds of letters to their staff and they consider him not a reliable source. The next day, Mike returns to meet with Garabedian who tells Mike that he spoke with his clients and they don't want to be in the press. Mike explains this isn't for a profile piece but for a Spotlight story much bigger, that will be on the front page. This catches Garabedian's attention who tells him to come back later that week.Robby and Sacha meet with Saviano and wonder about his credibility. He points out that he's being smeared for speaking out against the Catholic Church and complains that they never took him seriously before. They mention they have a new editor taking the story seriously and that Robby himself is now involved and he wasn't before. Saviano is convinced and decides to connect them with some of the survivors.Sacha meets with a heavy, effeminate man named Joe at a cafe; he is very sweet but nervous. Meanwhile, Mike meets with one of Garabedian's clients at his office, Patrick. He is a handsome, masculine father who explains that his dad killed himself and his mom was schizophrenic. He tells them he doesn't want his name published. The two interviews are intercut simultaneously. Joe was sent to a group for kids from troubled families by a nun, led by the priest who raped him. Patrick was taken in by the priest after he lost his father. The priest took him to go get ice cream, which excited him. But on the drive home, he started touching Patrick through his pants which scared him but he couldn't do anything because it was a priest. He mentions that he never even touched his ice cream; it just melted down his arm. Joe told him his priest knew he was gay and showed him a mobile over a baby's crib with different words like homosexual, transsexual, and bisexual on it. Being attracted to men and being forced into sex at an early age really affected him. His mother found out about it years later and complained about the incident to the cardinal who responded by moving the priest to another parish. Sacha asks if his mother ever hired a lawyer but he said he only went to a lawyer for the first time a few years ago and was told he could only get a small settlement. Sacha asks who the lawyer was but he cant remember the name, only that he was handsome. Sacha then realizes the lawyer was Eric MacLeish, whom they met with earlier. Finishing his interview, Patrick is now determined to expose priests who molest kids and says they can use his name if they want.Back at the Spotlight, everybody compares notes. Sacha realizes MacLeish has settled cases with a bunch of priests. They now have a list of four priests in the city who have molested kids. Mike gets in contact with Sipe, the former priest, on the phone. He is told it's not just a few bad apples molesting kids but that it is a psychiatric phenomenon. Mike explains to Robby later what he was told -- they all target kids from low income families with absentee fathers, in need of attention. They don't target boys because they're gay but because their actual sexuality has no basis on molesting kids; it's a form of power control. Sipe has learned of dozens of molesting priests over the years but when he went public, the church smeared him. Mike and Robby make their way to the basement where Matt has pulled the annual directories listing all the priests in Boston. The directories show where every priest is in a given year -- in one directory, Geoghan is listed as being on sick leave. They check the '91 directory for the year another priest was accused of molestation. He is also listed as being on sick leave. They realize it's an official designation by the church when someone is being moved after being caught molesting kids. Upstairs, they look through the directories and see ""emergency response"" and ""sick leave"" listed for all the molesting priests they know about.Marty is visited in his office by a critic who tells him that reporting on the church story could lose them a lot of subscribers. Marty realizes this is why he was invited to a Catholic Charities Gala. Sacha and Robby meet with Eric MacLeish again who won't talk about the cases he settled against the priest that molested Joe, the effeminate victim Sacha met with. They mention other cases and Sacha asks why there aren't any records. Eric tells them he dealt directly with the church, that it was a private mediation. Back in the office, Sacha realizes there's no paper trail because the victim had to sign a confidentiality agreement to get the settlement. Everything was done under the table and the lawyer gets his fee from the church who then maintains their clean image by washing the crime clean. Because Eric was confirmed to have defended the priests that molested the victims they were connected to through Saviano, it gives him credibility. They're now looking at seven or eight priests they can discuss in their story.Marty and Robby attend a gala run by the Catholic Church. Robby was invited by a friend from the high school he went to, which is across the street from the Globe. They are surrounded by powerful people in the Catholic Church and meet two of them, Jack Dunn and Peter Conley. Robby tells Marty that when they were investigating one of the priests a decade earlier, Cardinal Law called down the wrath of God on them and one of their editors broke his leg skiing days later. Jim Sullivan, the lawyer who defended priests in the past, greets Robby at the bar. Robby mentions how Eric MacLeish admitted to settling cases with the Archdiocese out of court, quietly, with cash and a handshake. Robby asks how many priests Jim has represented but Jim says he can't answer that because it's unethical. Robby tells Jim that he should want to be on the right side of this.On the same night, Mike meets with Garabedian for dinner and is told that one of his clients filed a criminal complaint but the Church stepped in to protect Geoghan, using their friends like Eric MacLeish. Garabedian mentions it took an outsider at the Globe -- Marty, the new Jewish editor -- to break a story. He tells Mike that it takes a village to raise a child and it takes a village to abuse one.At the Globe the next day, Sacha realizes there are several of the same terms that the directories uses when a priest is inexplicably removed from his parish. Richard Sipe, the former priest, calls in and Mike puts him on speakerphone. Sipe tells them that only 50% of the Catholic clergy practice celibacy, which creates a culture of secrecy -- covering up sex between consensual adults which extends over to covering up pedophiles. He continues, telling them that in 1985, a secretary canonist warned that pedophile priests would be a billion dollar liability for the Catholic Church. Sipe estimates that 6% of all Catholic priests molest minors out of sexual frustration because of their enforced celibacy as well as their secret shame of being homosexual or being a pedophile. Out of the 1,500 priests in Boston, that means at least 90 priests would be molesting kids. Robby suggests they use the directories to look up any priests listed as being on ""sick leave"" or ""absent on leave"" or ""unassigned""--code for priests being sent to church-run treatment centers. These same priests are moved from parish to parish every few years. The reporters all begin working on compiling a list of names with these designations.The entire team works tirelessly on scanning the directories. At home, Matt realizes one of the ""treatment centers"" is a house around the corner from his home. He goes outside and stares at the house, flabbergasted. He puts a sign on his refrigerator telling his kids to stay away from the house and the men who live there.At the office, they've finally compiled all their data into a spreadsheet. They have a list of 87 priests that the directory seems to suggest are molesting kids, right in line with the six percent of priests that Sipe suggested. Robby calls Jim Sullivan and asks him if there are as many as 90 priests that have been caught molesting kids in Boston. Jim tells him he has to stop this. Matt enters Robby's office and tells him that he discovered some of the molesters living near his home and asked him whether he can tell the neighbors about their findings. Robby tells him they'll tell them soon.Robby meets with Eric MacLeish, telling him he has a list of 87 priests that are potential child molesters. He needs to know which ones Eric has settled cases for (to verify their crimes since the directories are circumstantial). Robby threatens Eric that there are two stories -- one about the clergy covering for priests and the other about lawyers who spent ten years profiting off of sex scandals, never going public with the dozens of priests that were molesting young boys and girls. Eric agrees to help but says that he actually told the Globe about it years earlier and they buried the story. At the Globe, Sacha gets new clips and finds something very interesting -- a clip that confirms that MacLeish did give them a heads up years earlier.At the Globe, Robby reveals that MacLeish has shared a list of 46 priests he represented, along with some victims' names. Some of the victims of the eight they were told about by Saviano have agreed to go on record. Marty is concerned about Law, referencing Robby's story about how he called down the wrath of God after their past report. He wonders why he had such an extreme reaction when they reported on a single priest in the 1990s, given that the priest was elsewhere in Massachusetts. Robby suggests Law had to know there were others and it was a bigger story -- even bigger than 50 priests. They suspect that the Church manipulated the system so the priests wouldn't face charges; that reporting on the molestations won't get a public reaction (they seem like isolated incidents) but showing that the cover-ups came from the top will.Ben pulls Mike and Robby in his office. He is worried that Cardinal Law is going to bully them if they run a story, which could tank their paper. They have to take Law down in a way that he won't be able to recover from and he won't be able to smear them. That night, Sacha is leaving and shares with Robby the clip that she found, confirming MacLeish's story. Robby looks it over but has no response.The entire group begins to investigate policemen who were involved in the arresting of the priests and how the church covered it up with bribes and/or intimidation (including the cop on duty in the film's opener). Back at the office, Matt asks Robby if he knows of a Father Talbot at BC High. He remembers him from when he went there. He is given a printout about him.Mike is in court watching the case the Globe is filing against the church to unseal documents. The Catholic judge seems antagonistic to the Globe. The church's lawyer accuses them of just wanting to sell papers and Mr. Garabedian just wants to help his cases. Outside, Garabedian tells Mike that a priest discovered Geoghan was molesting boys in 1962 but when he told the Bishop, he was threatened into silence. Then, 30 years later, when he read about Geoghan molesting hundreds of boys, he felt guilty and called Garabedian, who asked the priest to come in and sit for a deposition on having given the church a heads up. But when he showed up, he was with the same lawyer attacking the Globe in court that day. Now the priest states he has a foggy memory and negates his claim that he told his superiors. A year earlier, Garabedian found an article from a local paper, revealing the priest finally went to the press to tell them about being silenced by officials in the 1960's. Now that he had him on record, he has a good reason to talk to him again. But when he filed a motion to depose him, the church's lawyer filed a motion opposing his motion. However, this allowed Garabedian to make an argument why he should be allowed to depose the priest and he's able to present the documents that have been sealed earlier. These 14 documents prove everything -- about the church, the bishops, Cardinal Law and now it's all public, in his case. But if Mike goes into a courtroom and tries to retrieve them, he'll find they are missing because the Church had them removed. Garabedian tells Mike to check the docket. Mike does and sure enough, the exhibits folder is empty.Mike calls Robby and tells him about the documents. He says that if the Globe's lawyer files a motion (for the lawsuit against the church), the judge will order Garabedian to refile the documents.The next morning, everyone is gathered around a TV. It is September 11, 2001 and they are watching the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington DC unfold on the news. Later, Cardinal Law is on TV, giving a speech about praying for the nation. Ben orders the Spotlight team to stop their story so they can focus on 9/11 -- the only story that could derail them from their larger investigation. Mike is sent away to Florida to investigate the flight school that trained the pilot of the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Center. He calls Garabedian and begs him not to refile the documents until he returns. Once he does, they'll be public record and another newspaper can break the story without all of the information they've uncovered. Garabedian says he can't make any promises.Robby meets with Saviano to tell him they've been taken off the story because the country needs the church at this time. Saviano points out he needed the church at one point and that a lot of people relived painful experiences in an effort to expose the crimes. He threatens to take the story to the Herald. Sacha calms him down by telling him they're not abandoning the story, she's met with too many survivors and their families to not tell the story -- but they need to tell it right and need a few more weeks. This calms Saviano down.In Florida, Mike gets a call from Robby who tells him that Garabedian refiled the docs. He is then told Marty has been put back on the story because of this; Mike flies back to Boston that afternoon.Robby visits the high school he went to and talks to the principal about the seven victims that have come forth about being molested by Father Talbot there. It is clear to Robby that the Brothers in charge must have known about the crimes because of how tightly run everything was. Jack Dunn and Peter Conley, who Robby met at the Catholic gala, are there, defending the school. But the schools president says that if he was on board at the time, he would have done something. He admits that they must have known since they sent Father Talbot out of town after he was caught. Robby is told by Jack that the presidents statement is off the record. Outside, Robby points out to Jack that both of them were athletes while Father Talbot was a coach at the school. They escaped molestation by pure luck. Robby notes that the Boston Globe is directly across the street from where these crimes took place.Mike gets to the courthouse and tries to get the documents. The clerk is standoffish and asks him if he knows what's he's retrieving. He is then told because of their sensitive nature, he must meet with a judge upstairs. He rushes up there and is given permission. When he gets back down and finally gets the documents, he's told he can't take them out of the building. He says he's going to make copies but is told the copy room closed at 4 PM. He then gives the clerk $83 in his pocket in exchange for using their personal copier.The documents reveal the church knew about the molestations based on letters written to Cardinal Law and how he demanded the victims' families keep silent. Another letter is from an auxiliary bishop who broke ranks, acknowledging Geoghan has a history of homosexual involvement with young boys, in an attempt to find some solution beyond a mild punishment of weekend work. Mike wants to write up the story but Robby tells him to hold off -- that there are 90 other cases out there and they need to get more evidence corroborating them to tell the bigger story. Mike is furious, worried that the Herald is going to steal the story before them and butcher it -- he is adamant that they nail the scumbags and they need to print the story to show the Church that they can't get away with what they've done.Mike finds Sacha at home. He asks her if she's ever thought of going back to church. She says she has attended with her grandmother but it's hard with all the things they now know. Mike mentions, growing up Catholic, it's hard to abandon it completely but after reading those letters, his faith collapsed.Robby meets up with Peter Conley in a hotel bar. Peter complains about Marty and says running the story will lose them subscribers. He tells Robby he doesn't want his career to be ended and him forever to be known as the guy who brought down the Globe. He writes the entire story off as being just a few bad apples. Robby realizes this is how the Church operates they have one guy lean on someone and the entire town looks the other way.At the Spotlight office the next day, Robby is told that Sweeney ruled in favor of the Globe to unseal the documents. The church has filed an appeal but the trial court is almost always upheld in manners like this. The documents will probably be released in mid-January, around the time Geoghan's trial begins. Ben and the Globes editor want to make their success against the Catholic Church a big story, focusing on a first amendment victory, but Robby doesn't want to alert the Herald of the story. Mike and Robby now tell Marty and Ben how some of the documents have already become public due to Garabedian slipping them into a public motion; these documents prove Law knew about the molestations in the 80s. Ben is upset that they didn't release the story but Robby tells him that the church covering up molestation has been going on for decades, even before Law, and the court covered it up. They think they can write everything up in two weeks but suspect it will be a poor move to publish the story during the first Christmas season after September 11th. They decide to run it right after New Years Day 2002, shortly before the Geoghan trial begins. Marty now tells the editor to bury the Globe's victory over the church in the metro section.The Spotlight team steps up their story. Mike begins writing. The team continues meeting with victims, priests, judges. The wife of a priest yells at Sacha when she asks to speak with him. The sister of a victim is also hostile. But Sacha also gets to speak to someone who is happy to talk. The team is getting quotes from various sources. Robby visits Jim Sullivan at his house, led in by Jim's wife. Robby tells Jim they're running out of time. He tells him they've got the cover-up stories of 75 priests but they need a solid confirmation from him because he represented them. He tells Jim he has to choose what side he's on. Jim tells Robby hes out of line but Robby responds that the entire city is out of line lawyers, politicians, cops. Everybody is looking the other way but Jim can put an end to it. Jim gets riled up, says that he defended the scumbags but it was his job to. He points out the Globe had a lot of information that could have alerted them to the story but they never did any investigating so they're just as guilty as everyone else. Jim kicks Robby out of his home. But as he walks to his car, Jim runs to him, still angry, but asks for the list. Jim reads it over and then circles every single name, verifying them as clients he once represented.Through Jack Dunn, Mike is able to make an offer to Law to defend himself in the Globe in a full page, unedited response. But later, he visits Marty and Ben to tell them that Law turned the offer down and the Archdiocese spokeswoman says they don't even want to know what the questions are. This gives them enough of a quote for their story The church had no interest in knowing what the Globes questions would be. Ben wonders about manning the phones come Sunday morning given all the attention the story will get; Robby tells him Matt and Sacha will be there working on a piece and they'll have a tip line listed where people can call with more information. Ben wants to hire extra staff to man the phones at reception, remembering the protests from the last story about a molesting priest. He's also concerned about picketers and angry letters. Robby mentions Jim confirming all the priests they suspected as being involved. He has been rattled by Tim's comment that the Globe should have caught it sooner. Ben tells him the story needed Spotlight since no singular reporter could have broken it. But Robby is still upset he was one of the reporters in the department that ran the story years earlier (i.e. the clip that Sacha gave to him) and he never thought to investigate it further. Marty tells them all to forgive their past sins because they need to prepare for Laws backlash after the story is published. As hard as they've worked over the last six months, they're going to have to work even harder from this point on.The team leaves for the night, content with all of their work. Mike stops by Garabedian's office and gives him an early look at the paper. When he leaves, he sees a mother and two children in a waiting room; the mother is fingering rosary beads. Its a callback to the opening scene at the police station with a mother in a waiting room with her kids. Garabedian tells Mike that both boys were abused weeks earlier and encourages Mike to keep doing his work.Sipe calls Mike about the story. Mike asks him how hes able to continue to believe in something after all he knows. Sipe says he still needs his faith; the church is an institution of men and even well-meaning men fail. The papers are printed, come off the presses, are transported around the city by trucks. They end up on doorsteps, in living rooms. The headline on the front page Church Allowed Abuse by Priest for Years. Matt takes a copy of the paper and drops it on the doorstep of the house where the molesting priest lives.Sunday morning, Matt is looking out his window. He notes that there aren't any protesters. His colleague suggests they're still at church. Robby finds Mike in the parking lot, even though its their day off. They want to go inside and get a sense of the response they're getting.Inside, the main receptionist is bored, saying its the easiest overtime she's made because nobody is calling their phone lines. She mentions that she had to send people down in the Spotlight office to help out Matt and Sacha. Mike and Robby rush down to the office. Phones are ringing off the hook. After getting off a call, Matt tells them they're getting tons of response, almost all positive and many from victims who have more tips. Matt suggests Robby and Mike help out. Mike answers a phone.The ending titles indicate that the cover-ups were revealed to have extended far beyond Massachusetts which led all the way to Vatican City. Hundreds of U.S. cities as listed as having similar scandals. Then dozens of countries are listed (Ireland, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Brazil, Mexico, etc), as well, where the abuse also extended to."
"McFarland, USA",2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2097298/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jim White moves his family after losing his last job as a football coach, and at his new school he turns seven disappointing students into one of the best cross-country teams in the region. A struggling coach and teacher who has had to move around for different incidents in his career finally comes to one of the poorest cities in America: McFarland, California. There he discovers buried potential in several high school boys and slowly turns them into championship runners and brings them closer than even he could ever imagine. Jim White, a school football coach at odds with the system and players, takes a job as an assistant football coach at McFarland. White finds the potential for cross-country in few students at the school. He gets interested in building up a cross-country team, but has to adjust his ways to suit the system. White and his team overcome poverty and personal turmoil, and get to the pinnacle of success.—Thejus Joseph Jose Kevin Costner plays a high-school football coach who ends up leading a cross-country track team made up unlikely students to a state championship. Jim White (Costner) finds his days as a football coach numbered when an incident with a player leads to his dismissal. Desperate for work, he moves his wife (Maria Bello) and daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) from Idaho to McFarland, CA, a rural town that's predominately Latino and the only place willing to give him a teaching job. The family feel like they don't fit into their new community, but White has an epiphany one day when he sees his students running from their early-morning farming jobs to school: Why not channel their talents into running cross-country track? Soon enough, White is connecting with his young charges, particularly a gifted athlete named Thomas (Carlos Pratts), and the squad set their sights on a state championship.. 1987. Jim White, a high school teacher and football coach, has been fired from one job after another, as the desired end of getting people to do the right thing in his mind has not always justified his sometimes impetuous and spontaneous actions as the means. He, his wife Cheryl White, and their daughters, mid-teen Julie White and preteen Jamie White, have only lived in largely white homogeneous environments, so when Jim accepts the only job he can get as life sciences and phys ed teacher and assistant football coach at McFarland High School in Central California, they are somewhat ill-prepared mentally for the relatively poor conditions and the largely homogeneous Hispanic population in the town, most of their neighbors Mexican immigrants who work as pickers in the surrounding agricultural fields. Within this situation, many of those in the next generation have little chance of getting out of this life, many turning to crime as a means to survive. Regardless, the Whites decide to live in McFarland instead of Jim making the commute from nearby Bakersfield, where most of the school's Caucasian teachers live. While the school's football team is as bad as most that he has coached, the one thing he does notice is that out of necessity many of the boys have the stamina to run long distances quickly. Beyond not respecting Mr. White who they mockingly call Blanco or Homey, the boys see running cross country, a team which Jim wants to establish at McFarland despite he having no history coaching runners, as an activity of the country club set. Jim does whatever he can to get the key boys in any way he can to be the core of the needed seven member team. For them to gel as coach and team members, they will have to understand the other better and fully embrace the opportunities. As the boys manage to reach one goal after another on the march to the state championships, their newfound support as a collective may be threatened by the realities of McFarland and Jim catching the attention of other, more prestigious schools in predominantly white, upper middle class communities.—Huggo Boise, Idaho. Year: 1987.Football coach Jim White (Kevin Costner) is chastising his players for a rather underwhelming game. One of his players starts to give off a bit of an attitude. After having had enough, Jim orders the player to leave. When he doesn't, Jim throws a shoe at a locker, which bounces off and strikes the player in the face, cutting his cheek.Following this incident, Jim is forced to move away with his wife Cheryl (Maria Bello) and two daughters, Julie (Morgan Saylor) and Jamie (Elsie Fisher). They settle down in McFarland, California in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood. On their first night there, the family goes to a small restaurant and leaves to find a large gathering of Latinos in cars surrounding the place. One man makes suggestive motions toward Julie, prompting the family to leave faster.Jim starts his new job as the life science teacher/PE and football coach assistant at school the next Monday. He meets Principal Camillo (Valente Rodriguez), who pairs Jim up with the current football coach. Jim later sends the students to do a lap, while three boys, the Diaz brothers - Danny, Damacio, and David (Ramiro Rodriguez, Michael Aguero, and Rafael Martinez) - are forced by their mother to leave.The football team plays a game against another school. One of the players, Johnny Sameniego (Hector Duran), gets injured on the field. The coach wants him to get back out there, but Jim orders Johnny to sit this one out. The home team then loses the game to an embarrassing 63-0.As the family continues to adjust, Jim's neighbor gives him a rooster as a gift. He goes to the store to buy it some feed. Outside, he sees some of his students drinking water from a hose. A man named Javi (Rigo Sanchez) picks up his nephew Victor Puentes (Sergio Avelar). The other boys tell Jim that Javi just ""got out"" while Victor's dad is still in there.The coach complains to Camillo about Jim's actions during the game and demands that he step down. Jim later sits out on the bleachers and watches the boys run a lap around the track with Jamie joining him. She comments that the boys, particularly Victor and Johnny (who got cut from the football team) move very fast. This sparks an idea in Jim.Jim goes to Camillo to convince him to let him start a track team to compete in the upcoming state championships. Jim also enlists Johnny's help to recruit six more runners for the team, starting with Victor. Johnny also asks the Diaz brothers, as well as two other students - Jose Cardenas (Johnny Ortiz) and Thomas Valles (Carlos Pratts). Thomas has gotten in trouble at school for being involved in altercations with other boys that mocked his younger sister for getting pregnant, so Jim negotiates for him to join the team to avoid suspension. Although the boys are initially reluctant, they agree to join the team and run with Jim across the town, with Danny lagging behind as he is the fattest of the team.After some training, the team goes to their first meet in Palo Alto. The boys from the other teams taunt the McFarland team with derogatory comments. The race commences, and the McFarland team lands in the final spot. Knowing the boys are disappointed, Jim takes full responsibility for the loss to not let them get discouraged.Jim learns of some of the boys' personal issues during their practice session. Thomas expresses his frustration due to his not seeing a better way out for himself and that he and his friends are only suited to picking fruits and vegetables in the fields all day. At home, Thomas's father has returned after a long absence. Thomas returns home one afternoon to find his parents arguing. His father starts punching the wall, and Thomas runs in to stop him.Jim takes up a lot of practice time that it causes him to be late for a birthday dinner for Julie, and he forgets to pick up a cake for her. She goes to her room, angry and disappointed. Jim later drives by a bridge and sees Thomas sitting over it. He approaches the boy and notices a bruise on his eye, which Thomas says was his own fault because he tried to stop his dad from hurting his hands so that he could keep working. Jim talks the boy down and tells him that he has good things ahead of him, encouraging him to continue doing something worthwhile.The Diaz brothers are pulled out of the team by their father, who wants them to keep working the fields. Jim goes to their home and offers his services to them. He even gets up as early as they do to go to the fields to pick produce in the blazing sun. By the end of the day, Jim is exhausted.The team goes up for another race to qualify for the championships. Danny notices the hill they must run over is VERY tall, to his dismay. The team competes, and they manage to just break into the top four teams, enough to qualify. Meanwhile, a coach from Palo Alto gives Jim a card in case he is interested in an open full-time position.Cheryl befriends Javi's girlfriend Lupe (Martha Higareda) when her car breaks down in the streets. Lupe invites Cheryl into her salon for a free manicure while Javi fixes the car. The Diaz family later shows up to the White home to make tamales and organize a car wash for team fundraisers. The Diaz matriarch says the team ought to use better uniforms and shoes. She says Jim is a good man, and then tells him to go take a shower.The team continues to practice harder, allowing Jim to bond with the boys. They name their team the McFarland Cougars. They even get new uniforms and shoes to go with it.The people in town learn that Julie just turned 15 and decide to help organize a quinceañera for her. They bring Cheryl, Julie, and Jamie to the salon while everyone sets up at home. Jim gets Julie a pretty dress, and she loves the party. Thomas gives her a bracelet that his grandmother made. Later, Javi and Lupe offer to take Julie out for her own ""parade"", with Thomas accompanying them. Not long after, their car is confronted by a group of punks that bother Javi. They attack the group, while they push Julie out of harm's way. The authorities contact Jim, forcing him and Cheryl to drive to the scene and find Julie on the ground, unharmed but with scrapes on her legs and shaking tearfully. Jim is angry over this, despite being assured that Julie was protected.Jim meets with the Palo Alto district for the coaching position. The boys and his family know about this, and they are upset with him. He tells Cheryl that he could bring them the better life that he promised them. Cheryl argues that they have settled in just fine here and it would be wrong for Jim to abandon the team and the friends they have made.The day arrives for the state championships. The whole community goes out to support the team. The race commences, which already sees a problem when Jim notices that Jose is moving too fast and worries that he will overexert himself. Thomas runs faster to pick up the slack as Jose starts to slow down. Thomas ends up crossing the finish line first, while the others come in closely. Jim worries when he doesn't see Jose, but to both his and Thomas's surprise, it is Danny that runs faster and picks up the slack.The judges tally their scores together, and, coming in first place is...MCFARLAND! The townspeople cheer for their team. Jim approaches the Palo Alto coach, which his family and the boys see. He comes back and smiles, simply stating, ""McFarland."" He hugs his family and then gets a hug from his team.The ending text says that the McFarland team won nine state titles over 14 years, all of which Jim White coached. We see the real coach and team running by a hill, all of them now grown men. The boys went off to college, and some, including Thomas Valles, the Diaz brothers, and Johnny Sameniego, went on to teach at the McFarland schools. Victor Puentes served a sentence at the penitentiary, but continued his education and got a good job. Jose Cardenas became a writer for The Los Angeles Times and is currently serving his country in the U.S. army. The McFarland team continued to run races in North America, Europe, and Asia. Jim White retired from coaching and still lives in McFarland."

Simon has a chance encounter with a former acquaintance, the off-kilter Gordo (Edgerton), who begins to surprise the couple with unwanted and increasingly menacing gifts. Eventually, Gordo also reveals a hidden secret from Simon's past and throws the couple's lives into a tailspin.. Simon and Robyn Callum (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) are a married couple moving from Chicago to California while recovering from a recent miscarriage. They find a lovely home near the place Simon used to live and decide to settle in.While getting furniture for their house, a man (Joel Edgerton) approaches Simon and claims to know him from high school. Simon doesn't recognize him until the man says his name is Gordon Mosely, or simply Gordo. He politely welcomes the couple to the area and leaves.Gordo first drops off a bottle of wine on the couple's doorstep as a welcoming gift. He later shows up while Simon is at work. Robyn invites him in and takes him on a tour of the house. In one room, they find a giant toy monkey, and Robyn tells Gordo that Simon has a phobia of monkeys. Robyn invites Gordo to stay for dinner. When Simon joins them, Gordo tells Robyn about how Simon used to have a campaign for class president and using ""Simon Says"" as his slogan, and it would get him anything he wanted. A little too drunk from wine, Gordo comments that ""Simon Says..."" applies to all the nice things Simon has in his life (great home, beautiful wife, nice job, etc.) which makes the couple a bit uncomfortable.Simon doesn't approve of Gordo visiting them, even crossing his name out over his phone number on the fridge and writing ""Weirdo,"" as that was Gordo's nickname in high school. Gordo continues to come to their house when Simon is at work, and he leaves gifts like a bunch of koi fish for the pond in front of their home, and he gets their cable TV working. He walks into the kitchen and sees ""Weirdo"" written on the fridge and leaves offended. To Robyn's surprise, Gordo later invites the couple over for a dinner party.Simon and Robyn go to a surprisingly nice home for the party. Gordo tells them that the other couple he invited just canceled on them. During the conversation, he mentions that he is not married. Gordo then gets a phone call which he claims is from work and he leaves Simon and Robyn home alone. Simon then starts making rude comments about Gordo, saying that he has a crush on Robyn and wants to do perverted things to her. Simon then suggests they go exploring the house. They find a bedroom with women's clothing, as well as what appears to be a child's bedroom. They hear Gordo's car returning, and they run back to the living room. When Gordo comes back inside, Simon asks him what he does for work. Gordo says that he lied and that he took a call from his ex-wife and admitted that it was a heated conversation. Simon insists that Robyn leave the room and Simon forcefully tells Gordo that he doesn't want him visiting them anymore.The next morning, Robyn thinks she hears noises while home alone. She goes outside and discovers that the koi fish are dead, and their dog, Mr. Bojangles, is nowhere to be found. Simon later goes back to Gordo's house, being greeted at the door by a woman whom he thinks is Gordo's wife. It turns out that Gordo doesn't live there. The Callums call the cops and find out that the couple in the house did know Gordo, and he had a key, since he handled their leased cars, and he had apparently used the key to get inside while the couple was on vacation. Without sufficient evidence, the cops can't do more than question Gordo, and they observe that Gordo would know who sent the authorities to him.Simon is being considered for a promotion at work, and after a good meeting with the two men who head the company, a colleague tells him that he has only one competitor for the position, Danny McDonald (PJ Byrne).Robyn continues to feel like Gordo is watching her at home. She takes some prescription pills that she pinched from their next-door neighbor, and she faints in the bedroom. She awakens to find herself lying on the bed.At night, Robyn walks into the kitchen and thinks she hears a noise. A thump is heard at the door. It's Bojangles, safely returned home. Robyn wakes Simon up, and they talk in the kitchen as Simon mentions he was going to tell Robyn that he got a promotion at work, but he found her passed out. He also takes out the pills he found and thinks that Robyn has had a relapse after previously abusing pills during their stay in Chicago. Robyn argues that Simon doesn't believe her suspicions about Gordo. Simon just thinks that the man has had a negative influence on their lives and it would be best to forget about him and move on.Over the next few months, Robyn becomes pregnant again. The couple lives on just fine until Robyn is told that a man is watching her at work. It's Gordo. Later, the couple finds a letter that apologizes for him bothering them, and he addresses Simon by saying he was willing to let ""bygones be bygones."" Simon denies knowing what Gordo is talking about.The couple goes to a baby shower for Robyn. She later takes a walk with Simon's sister Joan (Katie Aselton). Robyn asks her if she knew anything about Gordo. Joan says that it was reported that Simon and his friend Greg (David Denman) found Gordo in a car being molested by an older student, and this made everyone think he was gay.Robyn looks up Greg's name online and finds that he's a chiropractor. She makes an appointment to see him and starts to ask him about what happened between Simon and Gordo. Greg does not want to answer her questions but finally tells her that Simon made up the story about Gordo being molested because Simon was a bully and frequently targeted Gordo. This story also led to Gordo's father trying to burn him alive after thinking he was gay, resulting in his father's arrest.Robyn goes to Simon's home office and searches his desk, finding two files. One contains information about Gordo, and the other is about Danny McDonald, the other finalist for the job that Simon is hoping to get. She sees a mugshot of Gordo, as he was apparently arrested years ago for burglary. Robyn later confronts Simon when he gets home, and he callously states that while he did not know what Gordo's father tried doing to him, he doesn't care since his dad was hard on him, but he toughed it out and didn't feel he's done anything wrong. He starts to comment on Robyn taking pills, and she slaps him, saying he's just as much a bully now as he was back then. Simon later apologized to her and said he did a background check on Gordo to protect themselves.Simon goes to a bar where Gordo is hosting a trivia contest. Afterward, Simon finds Gordo in a parking garage and gives him a half-hearted apology, mainly because Robyn told him to. Gordo says it's too late for that, and while Simon thinks he's done with the past, the past isn't done with him. Simon knocks a basket out of Gordo's hands, spilling papers everywhere. Simon then kicks Gordo as he tries to pick them up, then presses him against the pavement, demanding that he accept his apology. Simon leaves and goes home to tell Robyn that Gordo won't bother them again.Simon gets the job, and the Callums host a dinner party to celebrate. A clattering sound is heard from upstairs, followed by another, and then something is thrown through the glass door, triggering the security system. Simon runs outside and sees someone running away. He tackles the man to the ground, thinking it's Gordo, but it is Danny McDonald, angry with Simon for fabricating information about him that not only cost him the promotion, but it also cost him his current job. Police sirens are heard, and Danny starts begging to be let go. Simon relents and allows him to leave. Robyn then announces that she's going into labor.Robyn gives birth to a healthy baby boy. However, she tells Simon that she doesn't want to go back home with him due to all the drama and madness he's caused. When he leaves her room, he gets a call from work saying he's being let go after word got out that he lied about Danny.Simon returns home to find a big wrapped box outside. In it is a baby bassinet the, and three numbered boxes. The first one contains a key to their house, showing how Gordo has been getting in and around their home. The second box has a tape that recorded Simon mocking Gordo when he left them to take his phone call. The third box contains a DVD of recorded footage showing Simon and Robyn having dinner and sleeping. Then there's footage of Robyn when she passed out, followed by Gordo wearing a monkey mask (to spite Simon since he has a phobia of monkeys) and pulling Robyn onto the bed, stroking her and waving to the mirror. The footage cuts off, leaving Simon to think that Gordo may have raped Robyn. While Simon watches the DVD, Gordo visits Robyn in the hospital with flowers to congratulate her on her baby. He has a bruise on his face and his arm in a sling. Robyn asks if Simon did it. Gordo states merely that people will get what they deserve and he exits.Simon rushes back to the hospital and finds Gordo getting into an elevator, but he fails to catch him. Simon runs out the hospital to give chase and receives a call from Gordo. He demands to know if Gordo did what Simon thinks he did. Gordo says no but then suggests maybe he did, and this is what happens when a bad idea is put into someone's head.Simon goes to find the baby to get a better look at his eyes. It still doesn't let him know whether the baby is Simon's or Gordo's. Robyn holds the baby and looks at Simon with displeasure. Simon slumps against the wall and quietly weeps, knowing his whole life is now ruined. Gordo briefly watches Simon before leaving and removing the sling from his arm; his mission to heartlessly destroy Simon's life is now completed."
Everest,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2719848/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of New Zealand mountaineer Rob Hall, who on May 10, 1996, together with Scott Fischer, teamed up on a joint expedition to ascend Mount Everest. On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds. Back in 1992, New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer, Robert ""Rob"" Edwin Hall, started guiding amateur climbers on Mount Everest. With his company named ""Adventure Consultants"", he successfully led 19 clients to the summit without a single fatality--and his 1996 Everest expedition, which consisted of eight clients and three guides--was the perfect example about the increasing demand for expeditions to the Everest. As a result, on 11 May 1996, Rob's team was joined by Scott Fischer's ""Mountain Madness"" company on a joint summit attempt, only to come face to face with the omnipotence of nature. In the end, when a furious blizzard struck, disaster was at hand.—Nick Riganas By 1996 guided climbs of Mount Everest has become an industry. The pioneer of this is New Zealander Rob Hall and he now leads another climb up the mountain. His climbs have largely been incident-free but the summit is now quite congested, adding to the possibility of a life-threatening incident.—grantss The opening text reads that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the first two people to successfully climb Mount Everest. Since then, only hundreds of professionals have attempted to do the same, with one in four dying.Set in the year 1996, Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) gathered his team, Adventure Consultants, to go ahead and climb Everest themselves. Rob meets with his team, including experienced climber Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), Doug Hansen (John Hawkes), Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori), and co-guide Andy ""Harold"" Harris (Martin Henderson). Together, they plan to embark on what they hope will be a successful and adventurous expedition.Six weeks before the initial climb, Rob and his team are in New Zealand ready to depart from the airport. He's with the manager of the base camp, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and his friend/co-worker Guy Cotter (Sam Worthington). Rob informs his friends that he booked journalist Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly) to do an article on them, which he was going to do for another expedition team, Mountain Madness. Rob later explains to his team the dangerous altitudes and temperatures of the Death Zone on Everest, which they hope to get past quick enough before things get really dodgy.Before boarding the plane, Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley). Rob promises to return home for the birth. Jan later sends him a message to let him know that they'll be having a girl.The expeditions make it to the bottom of the mountain before heading on up toward the base camp. There, Rob runs into Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), the leader of Mountain Madness. He's a bit peeved at Rob for getting Jon to move to their expedition, but is still on fine terms. Later, Rob introduces the team to the camp's doctor Caroline McKenzie (Elizabeth Debicki). She and Rob remind the climbers of the lack of oxygen at the top of Everest, as well as the dangers of hypothermia and hypoxia. We see clips of climbers succumbing to the cold and dying.Beck calls his wife Peach (Robin Wright) from the base camp after he forgot to send her a message for their anniversary. She doesn't like him climbing mountains and has stated that she'd divorce him if he ever climbed another mountain. He didn't listen.Adventure Consultants and other expeditions move from Base Camp to Camp II. They walk across a fixed ladder acting as a bridge hanging over a crevasse. Huge ice chunks break off and slide down under the weight of all the climbers, causing the ladder to shake, making Beck nearly fall over. He hangs on for dear life and is guided by Rob the rest of the way over.Facing some concerns, Rob suggests to Scott that they join their expeditions together to get to the top safely, and to ascend at a later date. Scott is hesitant, saying that he and Rob have different styles, but he ultimately agrees to the union. The two meet with their teams later to state that they plan on having eight oxygen tanks at the top. Scott's guide, Anatoli Boukreev (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), says he won't use oxygen. Rob urges the rest of his team to use oxygen.The AC team gathers in a tent at night to discuss why they're climbing. Doug says that he wants to prove that an ordinary person can do the impossible. Yasuko wants to be the oldest woman to climb Everest.The teams encounter problems on their summit, such as several climbers beginning to fall ill (like Doug and Scott), Beck having trouble seeing due to a surgery he had a year before, and no fixed ropes over the south summit, forcing some climbers to turn back. Beck stays behind on the southeast ridge. Guy, who is scaling the mountain next to Everest, observes Rob and company from his POV and contacts them to make sure they're okay.Finally, some of the climbers start to make it to the very top and mark their spots on Everest. Anatoli is the first to touch the top, and Yasuko puts a Japanese flag on there. Rob contacts Helen back at base camp to inform her and the team that they made it to the top. She and the rest of the camp cheer the team on.Doug is still climbing, despite his health rapidly deteriorating and his oxygen levels dropping. Rob runs into him on the way down and he insists to Doug that it's over and that he gave it a good run, but Doug is not yet satisfied and decides he wants to keep climbing. Moved by his determination, Rob guides Doug to the top.A huge blizzard starts moving toward Everest, spelling trouble for the descending climbers. Rob and Doug get hit as the storm hits the mountain, forcing them to take cover. As they get lower, Rob notices there aren't any oxygen tanks where he requested, so he radios Helen to send some up. He and Doug keep walking as the winds intensify. Doug, barely conscious, unbuckles himself from Rob's guide rope. His dizziness, combined with the heavy wind, causes him to fall over the edge to his death.Beck's vision worsens, while Scott starts suffering from hypothermia, forcing them to stay behind from their respective groups. The other climbers go get help, leaving Beck behind with Yasuko. Andy goes up to Rob, wherein Rob tells Andy that Doug is gone. Rob and Andy wait on the side of the mountain until it's safe to keep going. Unfortunately, Andy begins to feel the hypoxia, making him believe he's overheating, and he removes his clothes, leading to his death.Helen, sitting in the tent with Caroline and Guy (who has come to join the camp), radios Rob and urges him to keep moving downward. He tells her that his hands and feet are frozen, and also that Doug and Andy are dead, bringing everyone in the tent to tears. Helen calls Jan and gets her to talk to Rob by putting the phone next to the walkie-talkie. Jan encourages her husband to get down safe, reminding him that he has to return for the birth of their baby.Rob is told by Helen that the people meant to bring him the oxygen tanks aren't coming because of the terrible conditions. He tries to keep moving on his own, but even he knows he can't make it in his condition. He falls over and calls Helen again. She calls Jan again so that she can speak to him one last time. He tells her he is comfortable, and asks how Sarah (the baby) is doing. Jan tearfully agrees to call her Sarah. Rob's last words to her are ""Sleep well, my sweetheart. Please don't worry too much.""Rob passes away under the snow and ice. Scott succumbs to the cold and lies in the snow to die. Yasuko has also died next to Beck's side. Helen calls Peach to tell her that Beck never returned to camp, which she must in turn tell her kids.Beck, however, despite being frostbitten, partially blind, and almost totally frozen, starts to get up and slowly head on back to camp. Jon spots him and radios Helen to let her know that Beck is alive. She in turn calls Peach to tell her the news. Together, they get a helicopter to fly up and bring Beck back. The helicopter is almost brought down by the winds and extra weight, but they succeed in bringing him down where he gets heated up.Helen and the other climbers return home. They are seen meeting Jan at the airport and tearfully hugging her. Beck also returns home and hugs Peach.The last shot is of Rob's body, frozen and almost completely covered in snow. The final text states that Rob's body is still up on Everest alongside the others that perished. We see photos of the real Rob Hall, Doug Hansen, Andy Harris, Yasuko Namba, and Scott Fischer. Beck Weathers lost his nose and both hands due to frostbite. Jan Arnold gave birth to a girl, whom she named Sarah. We then see a brief video clip of the real Sarah Arnold-Hall."

They go play the piano, eat Chinese food, sing karaoke in a bar, and look for the Nutcracka Ball, the Holy Grail of all Christmas parties, for the very last time. On their quest they run into difficulties: Isaac is totally wrecked from all the drugs he has taken, Chris is trying to get some weed for his famous friends, and Ethan is still not over his ex-girlfriend Diana.—immevangorp Every Christmas Eve for the last decade, best friends Isaac (Seth Rogen), Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Chris (Anthony Mackie) have reunited for a wild night in New York City. But since the guys are getting older and facing new responsibilities, their tradition is about to end. As a result, they plan one last epic night together, which includes finding their way to a legendary party called the Nutcracka Ball.. Friends since high school, thirty-four year olds Ethan Miller, Isaac Greenberg and Chris Roberts have a had a blow out of a night every Christmas Eve for the last fourteen years, the tradition, which includes set things on the to do list, having started in Isaac and Chris coming to needy Ethan's aid in he just having lost his parents. For the last half of those Christmas Eves when they first found out about it, they have wanted to attend the highly secretive and exclusive Nutcracker Ball, they so far unsuccessful in locating it. They have decided due to changes in their lives that this will be their last Christmas Eve as a blowout night, Isaac and his wife Betsy expecting their first child, while Chris, an NFL player, is having a breakthrough season, this the first year he having some level of celebrity and the perks that go along with it. The problem for Ethan, a so-called musician, is that his life has stalled, albeit largely on his own lack of initiative and thus feels he needs his friends more than ever. What they hope will be the last epic blowout takes on greater proportions when Ethan locates, i.e. steals three invitations to the Nutcracker Ball, those invitations just the first of many steps to gain entrance. As they get sidetracked this night by individual issues in their respective lives, they may come to some realizations about those lives and their chosen paths, Ethan's which includes running into Diana, the one that he let get away.—Huggo Christmas Eve, 2001Ethan Miller (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) just lost his parents in a car accident. His best friends Isaac Greenberg (Seth Rogen) and Chris Roberts (Anthony Mackie) stay by his side and start a tradition to hang out every Christmas Eve. In 2008, while out at a bar, the guys meet a woman that tells them they came from the craziest Christmas party ever - The Nutcracker Ball. For the next few years, the guys try to find out where the party takes place, but they never succeed.In the present day of 2015, Chris is now a famous football player that secretly uses steroids while Isaac is married to Betsy (Jillian Bell) and is expecting their first baby. Ethan is a struggling musician that has recently broken up with his girlfriend Diana (Lizzy Caplan) and works at a hotel dressed as an elf where he gets chewed out by his boss (Randall Park) for not acting enough like an elf. While tending to the coats, Ethan finds something in one of the pockets - three tickets to The Nutcracker Ball. Excited, Ethan runs out of work with the tickets. He calls the number on the tickets to find out the location of the party, only to be told by an automated message that the location will be announced at 10:00 PM.Isaac is at a party hosted by Betsy's sister Cindy (Helene Yorke). Ethan, already a little drunk, shows up before Chris arrives. Isaac and Chris want their yearly tradition to end now that their lives are moving in different directions, but they don't think Ethan is quite ready. Before they head out for the festivities, Betsy gives Isaac a box full of every drug known to man (weed, coke, shrooms, molly, etc.)Since Chris is the new face of Red Bull, he gets a huge limo to take them around for the night. The guys go in front of the tree in the city where Ethan shows off the tickets to his buddies. They plan to kick off the night by going to FAO Schwartz and dancing on the piano like Tom Hanks in ""Big"" to Kanye West's ""Runaway"". Chris calls his football buddy Tommy Owens (Aaron Hill), who is attending The Nutcracker Ball and requests that he bring weed. The guys call their dealer Mr. Green (Michael Shannon). He meets them in front of their old high school, and Chris has to go into the car to get the weed. Mr. Green shares some weed with Chris and tells him to go to a party he's throwing later, and to tell Isaac that he'll see him later.The guys go to a karaoke bar where the three of them sing ""Christmas in Hollis"" while wearing three festive sweaters that Ethan wants them to wear. They are met by Diana and her friend Sarah (Mindy Kaling). Ethan and Diana awkwardly catch up while Isaac is already tripping on shrooms. He runs into the bathroom to do coke and balance himself out, and then he makes a crazy video expressing his fears over becoming a dad. When he goes back to talk to Sarah, he gets them both drinks but his nose starts bleeding and a drop falls into Sarah's drink. She has a sip and doesn't realize what happened until Isaac's nose bleeds harder and he admits he did coke. Outside the bar, Chris talks to a fan named Rebecca (Ilana Glazer), who admittedly hates Christmas. The two have sex in the bathroom.Afterwards, Ethan calls the number on the tickets again and learns the address of the party. Chris then realizes that he doesn't have the weed on him anymore and that Rebecca must have stolen it from him during sex. They contact Mr. Green again and must wait for him in from of Chris's mother's house. Knowing Mr. Green will take a while, the guys go inside and quietly play N64. Isaac then goes to get the weed when Mr. Green shows up. He shares weed with Isaac and gives him a glimpse into the future. The two of them are at a strip club, and Betsy is sitting in the front. The dancer they are watching happens to be Isaac and Betsy's 18-year-old daughter, horrifying him even further about having a kid.When Isaac goes back inside the house, his phone's ringtone goes off, waking up Mrs. Roberts (Lorraine Toussant). She feeds the guys while Isaac continues to trip out. He then looks at his phone and receives a dick pic from a guy named James. Confused, Isaac responds and is propositioned by James. He then realizes he took Sarah's phone by mistake, and if Sarah is still upset about drinking Isaac's bloody martini, she will probably show Betsy the video Isaac made. Meanwhile, Chris tells his mom how Ethan is not over Diana, to which Mrs. Roberts states that he ought to take the opportunity on Christmas to make it up to her.After the guys leave, they spot Rebecca on the street. Chris forces his driver (Nathan Fielder) to chase after her to get his weed back. The driver runs a red light and the limo gets struck by a car. The guys run out and try to take a sleigh to catch up with Rebecca, but it's chained to a lamp post, causing the guys to go flying when the reindeer pull it. Isaac gets dragged across the street until he hits some cones. Chris runs after Rebecca himself, chasing her to the rooftop of a building. When he catches up to her, she tells him that he should go spend time with his friends instead of worrying about the weed. She then jumps off the building and lands in a dumpster before disappearing.Isaac goes to a church where he starts talking to the nativity display. He runs into Betsy and her family, who invite him to Midnight Mass, despite Betsy knowing how fucked up Isaac is. He continues to trip out in the church and hallucinates that a baby is cursing at him. He then panics when he sees Jesus on the cross and thinks that everyone is judging him because he's Jewish. Isaac gets nauseous and runs out to puke in front of the whole congregation. He runs away from the church.Meanwhile, Ethan wanders the streets alone and runs into two drunk guys (Jason Mantzoukas and Jason Jones) both dressed as Santa pissing in the street. Ethan criticizes them for mocking a Christmas tradition. He ends up getting into a fight with them, leaving him disgraced. He gets a phone call from Diana, who is already at The Nutcracker Ball, asking if Isaac has Sarah's phone.The guys meet up again and get on the subway to head to the party. Ethan is pissed at them for leaving him alone, and he argues with Chris as he refuses to wear his ""Black Santa"" sweater.The guys go to a bodega that holds a secret entrance to the party. Isaac returns Sarah's phone and gets his back. He then finds out that the James who sent the dick pics is none other than...Franco. He is still interested in sharing his dick with Isaac, though he declines. Chris runs into his football buddies and sees that they already had a ton of weed. They then make fun of Chris for the video of him performing karaoke with Ethan and Isaac. Ethan then spots Miley Cyrus and asks her to help him out with Diana, knowing she is a huge fan of Miley. Thinking Ethan wants to propose, Miley agrees to help. She gets onstage and performs ""Wrecking Ball"" with Ethan's help. Ethan then gives an impassioned speech to Diana and proposes to her. Under pressure, Diana says yes. However, when she pulls Ethan aside, she makes it clear that they are not engaged and that he cannot use her as a lifeline because his friends won't continue the tradition.Isaac, still tripping, accidentally knocks some people over with decorations and ends up impaling Tommy's hand with a broken glass. When the others try to beat him up, Chris threatens to film them and use his social media status to ruin them. They try to run away, but security takes them out of the party.Ethan goes on the roof in shame. He is encountered by Mr. Green, who has been hosting The Nutcracker Ball for the last 20 years.

Max remains a firm believer in Santa Claus, and intends to send him a letter. on sending a letter to him. In his family are his parents Tom and Sarah; his teenage sister Beth; his aunt Linda and uncle Howard; their children Howie Jr., Stevie, Jordan, and baby Chrissie; Sarah and Linda's cantankerous aunt Dorothy; and Tom's mother Omi, who speaks mostly in German. Max wants to continue family traditions, but tension between his relatives leads to them losing their Christmas spirit. The movie opens with a montage of crazed customers storming into a store for their Christmas shopping, trampling over the store's employees before maniacally grabbing every hot item they can get their hands on, all to the tune of ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"". In the mall, we see two parents, Tom and Sarah Engel (Adam Scott and Toni Collette), run to their son Max (Emjay Anthony) as he is fighting with another child after this child spoke ill of Santa Claus to the other children. Max's sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) gleefully films everything on her phone.The family returns home where Max's German grandmother Omi (Krista Stadler) is baking. Sarah continues working in the kitchen in anticipation of her sister and her family arriving. She is anxious, as is everyone else, but Sarah tries to keep the Christmas spirit alive in the house. She hangs up a picture of her family posing with Santa, but it's ruined by everyone looking uninterested and Santa checking out Beth's butt.Sarah's sister Linda (Allison Tolman) arrives with her husband Howard (David Koechner) and their kids - Howie Jr (Maverick Flack), Stevie (Lolo Owen), Jordan (Queenie Samuel), and Baby Chrissy, along with the family dog Rosie. Also joining them, to Sarah's extreme displeasure, is their Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell), whom Sarah considers to be a nightmare. The family gathers for dinner, where Howard takes the time to boast about his use of guns, despite Linda telling him not to bring that up. Dorothy insults Sarah's cooking, so Sarah goes to get the dessert in the kitchen, where Dorothy follows her to make more complaints until Sarah shuts her up. Stevie and Jordan mock Max for still writing a letter to Santa. They swiped it off of him and start reading off Max's wishes. He wants his parents to be in love again, for him and Beth to spend time like they used to, and for things to go better between Linda and Howard. Stevie gets angry when she reads that Max wrote that Howard wishes she and Jordan were boys. Max loses it and fights Stevie to get the letter back. He yells at the whole family and says he wishes Christmas was like it used to be, but now he hates the holiday and his dysfunctional family before running back upstairs.Tom goes upstairs to comfort his son and remind him that this is the time of year where they have to deal with family members like this. After Tom leaves, Max puts his Santa letter into an envelope, but he is too angry to go through with it and he tears up the letter. He throws the pieces out the window, which are then blown up high into the sky. A dark cloud then forms over the whole neighborhood, followed by a strong gust of wind that takes out the power.The next morning, the whole family is struggling without heat and electricity as a snowstorms blows through the area. Max looks out the window and notices a creepy snowman having been built in front of the house. Someone knocks on the door and Linda answers it to find a delivery guy bringing some boxes. Next to him is a sack of gifts, but he claims it didn't come from him. Beth suggests that she walk a few blocks to her boyfriend Derek's house to see if he has power (and also so she won't be stuck with the family). Although Sarah is hesitant, she and Tom allow Beth to go out for an hour.Beth walks through the storm and sees a large horned creature perched on top of a roof. The sky becomes darker, and the creature appears to follow Beth. She runs away as the creature pounces across rooftops. Beth finds the delivery guy literally frozen in fear. She hides underneath his truck as the creature lands on the ground, where Beth sees its hooves. To her side, she sees a jack-in-the-box playing a tune. It opens and a smaller creature emerges slowly before attacking Beth.As it gets darker, Tom and Sarah become concerned when Beth doesn't return. Howard agrees to go out with Tom in his Hummer to find her, and Howard gives Tom a gun to carry just in case. They go to Derek's house and find it unoccupied and wrecked. The two see large hoofprints in the snow. They go back outside and Tom hears Beth screaming. He runs to find her, only for something burrowing underneath the snow to grab Howard. It nearly drags him beneath the snow until Tom shoots at the creature and sends it fleeing. They find the Hummer has been destroyed and they run home. The ladies tend to Howard's leg, which appears to have a bite mark on it. Omi is seen looking nervous by the fireplace. Tom says they need to board up the house and look for Beth in the morning.The adults decide to take turns keeping watch for anything suspicious. Howard volunteers to stay awake while Tom rests with his family. Howard also apologizes to Tom for thinking he was always a ""spineless dick"". Eventually, everyone falls asleep and the fire goes out. A hook descends from the chimney with a gingerbread man cookie tied to it. This awakens Howie Jr. He goes over to the cookie and takes a bite out of its head, only for the gingerbread man to come to life and frighten Howie. The hook wraps around Howie and starts pulling him up the chimney. Sarah wakes up and runs to grab the boy, with the rest of the adults grabbing her for help. Sarah accidentally kicks a hot log toward the Christmas tree, igniting the presents and then the whole tree. Max runs to get the fire extinguisher and puts out the fire, but Sarah gets freaked out by the cookie, causing her to let go of Howie, and he is taken up the chimney.Now convinced that something unnatural is occurring, Omi speaks English for the first time to tell the family that she knows who is doing this, and that this is all their fault. She says she experienced the same thing as a child. Through an animated sequence, we see Omi as a little girl in her old poverty-stricken village. She was holding a toy Santa and a loaf of bread, but the other villagers snatched the bread from her and fought each other for it. When Omi returned home, her parents didn't help matters through their own bad behavior, and her mother ripped the Santa doll. Omi lost her holiday spirit and threw the doll in the fireplace after wishing that her parents would go away. This wish would summon an ancient spirit that arrives to punish anyone that disrespected the Christmas spirit. the spirit's name is Krampus, and he brings multiple helpers to terrorize the misbehaved. Omi watched as Krampus and his helpers dragged her parents to their underworld, with Krampus leaving her with nothing but a bauble with his name on it as a reminder of what she's done. Omi shows the family the bauble, and to this day, she has regretted making that wish. Howard remains unconvinced that this is the work of some supernatural entity, and he grabs his shotgun to go out and find Howie. As he opens the door, he discovers a snowman with a close resemblance to Howie on the front porch. Several demonic creatures lurk behind the snowmen, and Sarah pulls Howard back inside the house.Tom devises a plan to get to the snowplow with the family and head to the mall for shelter. Meanwhile, Stevie and Jordan think they hear what sounds like Beth's voice coming from upstairs. They walk up to investigate, but then the adults hear the girls screaming. Tom, Sarah, and Linda run up to the attic and notice that the kids' presents had something burst out of them. They then come across an enormous, worm-like Jack-in-the-Box in the process of swallowing Jordan whole. Tom shoots it, causing it to flee towards the vents, where it later escapes. The adults then get attacked by demonic toys. Sarah faces her mother's angel ornament that nearly hangs her with Christmas lights, Linda is jumped by an evil teddy bear, and Tom is attacked by a robot toy. Downstairs, Howard gets shot with a nail gun by three gingerbread men. Linda sees Stevie in the next room, driving her to grab an icicle and stab the teddy in the eye. She grabs a hatchet and swings at the angel and robot before running to Stevie. Sarah gets Howard's gun and shoots the robot to pieces. Howard shoots a lantern that burns the cookies, only for one to survive and pounce toward him, but Rosie eats it.The family goes downstairs to the living room where Max sends Rosie into the ventilation shaft to combat the clown, but the dog is consume by it off-screen. The Jack-in-the-Box clown suddenly crashes through the ceiling into the living room. Before Howard can kill it, the teddy and cherub leap down from the hole in the ceiling to attack once more. Dorothy takes the shotgun and kills the teddy and angel, but before she can finish off the clown, a group of dark elves break into the house. They take Dorothy and Chrissy, while Howard is lost when he grabs onto the clown's tail as it is sucked out through the hole in the wall. A loud thumping is heard on the roof, signifying the arrival of Krampus and causing the elves to flee. Omi stays behind while Tom, Sarah, Linda, Max, and Stevie escape. Omi then comes face-to-face with Krampus, who looks like a demonic Santa Claus with a long tongue. He opens his sack in front of Omi, and a gruesome-looking nutcracker soldier grabs her and pulls her inside.The family heads toward the snowplow, only for the creature in the snow to attack again. It first takes Tom before also getting Linda and Sarah. Max and Stevie get into the snowplow. Max tries to start it, but the elves attack and take Stevie. Max runs after her and he is faced by Krampus. He hands Max his torn-up letter that is wrapped around a bauble similar to what he gave Omi. This leads Max to realize that it's his fault that Krampus arrived. He follows the demons to a spot where they are preparing to take Stevie. Max calls to Krampus and throws the bauble back toward him. It sinks in the snow and opens up a massive hole in the earth that leads to the underworld. The elves hold Stevie over it until Max tells Krampus that he knows it's his fault that Krampus is there, and he offers to take Stevie's place. Krampus wipes Max's tear with his claw, but he and the elves start laughing as they throw Stevie into the hole. Krampus grabs Max and holds him over the hole. Max says he only wishes Christmas could be like it used to be. Krampus drops a screaming Max into the hole.Max then wakes up and finds himself in his room, and it's now Christmas Day. He goes downstairs and sees the whole family together, looking more happy and peaceful than they did a few days ago. They start to open presents, and Max hugs his parents, thinking the whole ordeal was just a bad dream. He then opens his gift to find the Krampus bauble, and suddenly everyone has an ominous look on their faces as their memories of the horrific events slowly come back to them. The camera pans out revealing that either the family is being watched through a snow globe by Krampus, along with hundreds of others in his collection, or are now held prisoner for all eternity by the evil Krampus.The evil toys then appear for one last jump scare."

In the years to come, a chance encounter with charismatic philanthropist Ellis Jones reignites her passion for life and romance. When a weekend with his parents threatens to uncover the truth, Adaline makes a decision that will change her life forever.—Miss W J Mcdermott Adeline, a young married woman with a child crashes her car on a December night and something many would believe impossible happens at the scene. Adeline stops aging. She has lived through about 8 decades in her prime. In present day, Adaline meets a man named Ellis Jones and regains passionate feelings. Her love story with him is epic and will remain timeless for ages.—Gerald McGlothlin Adaline (Blake Lively) has kept to herself for decades in order to keep secret the fact that she has remained 29-years-old for nearly a century. However, when she meets a handsome philanthropist named Ellis (Michiel Huisman), she strains against the self-imposed exile she's lived in. When her secret may become public, she is forced to take greater control over her life. Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) is seen purchasing fake ID's at an apartment in San Francisco. The forger asks her why she chose to be 29 with her looks, she could shave off a few years. She smiles and says he's too kind. While leaving, she asks why he makes fakes ID's when he has the potential for much more. She also notes that the autographed baseballs on his desk show his real name. ""It's the little things that slip you up"", she says.Adaline goes home to her apartment where her dog greets her. It is seen that during her 107 years of being alive, she has raised the same dog over and over again. She notes she is late for work at the library's office of archives.While working, she opens a film reel and her life is explained. She was born on New Years Day in 1908, got married, had a child, and became a widow when her husband suffered an accident during the building of the Golden Gate Bridge. One night, an unexplainable snow begins to fall as she is driving to her parents house. She suffers a car accident/lightening strike combination that causes her to remain 29 years old forever. At first it is not noticeable, but as her daughter (Ellen Burstyn as an old woman) grows older, it becomes more apparent. One day she is pulled over by a cop, who takes away her ID as it says she is in her late 40's. She decides to move away and does a year of research at a medical college but cannot find anything to explain her condition where she cannot age.Late one rainy night, she is walking home when two FBI agents follow her. They put her in a car and try to take her on an airplane. She escapes out the trunk and decides she will spend her life on the run with a new look and identity every decade. She explains this to her daughter (now an adult) and they have a heartfelt goodbye.At present day, Adaline adds a co-signer to her account (her new identity) and has a flashback to when she first opened the account. She had invested in Xerox and it has paid off well, which explains her financial situation. She is planning to leave soon to live on a farm in Oregon.It's New Years Eve and she enters the hotel to a party. On the wall is a picture of her with friends and its clearly from many decades ago. She stares at it and moves on to find her friend who is playing the piano for a party. Her friend is blind and jokes to Adaline that they're cougars as only young men go after her (her friend assumes they're both old ladies). A young man walks up to Adaline and she quickly pins him, Sherlock Holmes style. From his expensive heirloom watch to the paint on his hands, she knows hes an artist who comes from a wealthy family. As they make small talk, Ellis Jones (Michael Huisman) walks in the room. They have a moment of eye contact until a brunette kisses Ellis on the cheek and Adaline looks away.At midnight, she walks out of the room and calls her daughter. Her daughter sings happy birthday on the phone and confirms lunch the next day. A young man walks up to Adaline and tries a smooth line about kissing a stranger at midnight. He asks if shes heard it before and she says yes, from a young Bing Crosby-type. She says goodbye to her friend and walks to the elevator.Before the elevator closes, Ellis pushes his hand to open it and they ride down together. He tries to smooth talk her and fails. She politely turns him down all the way to her taxi.The next day at work, her co-workers mention a generous benefactor is coming by to donate some books. Surprise, its Ellis! He brings her books that have flowers in the name (alluding to their elevator conversation). Apparently, he's seen her before at board meetings and knew she worked there. He asks her to be in the photograph they're doing for publicity and she quickly says no, she doesn't like being photographed. He suggests a date instead and she says no. He then says he'll withdraw his donation if she declines the date.In the next scene, they are in the tunnels beneath San Francisco. They found a boat. He tells her a great deal about himself and then asks about her. All she is willing to say is ""I have a dog"". As they leave, he offers to tell her a joke and if she laughs then she has to go out with him again. He tells a terrible joke and she laughs.Adaline goes to Ellis' apartment for the next date where they have hot dogs, wine, and listen to jazz. They spend the night together. The next morning, Ellis is on the phone having trouble with a work call in Portuguese. (He majored in mathematics and discovered an algorithm. Ellis friend figured out how to make money off it so they split the profits and his friend is off in Fiji while Ellis is a philanthropist.) Adaline rapidly fires off some Portuguese on his phone and leaves.Somewhere in there is a scene between her and her daughter, who could look like Adaline's grandmother. She talks about having trouble getting up stairs and wants to move to a retirement home in Arizona. Adaline is upset and says she planned on moving to Oregon so they could see each other more. Her daughter urges Adaline to stop running, as the people who were interested in catching her have long since passed away.Adaline also has a flashback to an unknown man. He is fiddling with an engagement ring. She doesn't go to meet him. Presumably because of this memory, she doesn't respond to any of Ellis' calls. He shows up her cheap apartment in Chinatown and she freaks out, demanding to know how he found her address. She brushes him off.While looking through old photographs, she has a change of heart. Shes clearly very lonely. During this time, she has had to put her dog down. She goes back to Ellis work to apologize. They go on a date to an old covered drive-in movie theater. She explains the history as if she was there (which she was). They drink wine and look at the stars on the ceiling. He asks her to attend his parents 40 year anniversary party and she says yes.On the way there, she drives as if she has nine lives (as a joke) and picks up his sister. They enter his home and she is greeted by William Jones (Harrison Ford), who immediately calls her Adaline. She says that was her mother. He's very shaken and says they were very close.The next morning William cant stop talking about Adaline which makes his wife a little annoyed. There's another flashback which explains how they met. Adaline was having car trouble while she was living in England and he was a soldier studying medicine overseas. They both returned to America together. She pushed William to follow his dream of astronomy instead of medicine (he was afraid of running out of time). He was the one with the engagement ring. He describes things about Adaline that Ellis picks up on, such as her interest in languages and driving skills.That night, they play trivia. William is on a 47 game winning streak. Adaline pretends to not know an answer but after a diss by Ellis she goes all out and wins. The family jokes that they didn't know what would happen first, Williams loss in trivia or the arrival of Della a meteor he predicted would come (it never arrived) and also Adaline's nickname.The day of the party, everyone is out doing things. Adaline talks to William and he notices a scar on her left hand a scar from stitches he made while they were hiking (its not explained how her scar doesn't heal or how her hair grows or details like that if shes immortal). He rummages through an old shed to find a picture to make sure he isn't crazy. (Yep, same scar.) He runs after her, asking her if this is the reason she left him. She says yes. He begs her not to run but she says she doesn't know how.She runs back to the house, writes a note to Ellis, packs, grabs his car keys and leaves. Ellis comes home and is confused. William doesn't explain anything. Ellis drives his dad's car to chase after her.Adaline is driving in the woods when she stops. She calls her daughter and they have a moment. She decides she will stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her and drives off. Inexplicably, snow begins falling again. Ellis pulls up and sees what's happening. An ambulance takes her to the hospital.She wakes up to Ellis and decides to come clean. Her daughter arrives, sees Ellis, and says ""I'm her grandmother."" Adaline tells her he knows and she cries with joy and hugs him.One year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Years Eve party. Adaline suggests her daughter to go out but she has a date night in (another puppy). Before leaving, Adaline checks the mirror and does a double take. She plucks a gray hair, a sign of aging. Apparently, a combination of the defribilator and hypothermia have restored her humanity. Also, Della the meteor arrives. It's 50 years too late, but it shines brighter than ever."

Things are going well, but then she learns that Rose has died, and decides to return to Ireland, temporarily. She and Tony hastily get married, and then she sets off back to Ireland, alone. Life is about to get complicated.—grantss 1950. Despite having a good head on her shoulders and being a hard worker, shy Eilis Lacey has had no opportunities in life in her hometown of Enniscorthy, Ireland, especially ending up working a dead end job as a clerk in demanding and disagreeable Miss Kelly's grocery store. Realizing Eilis' situation, her caring sister, Rose Lacey, makes arrangements with Father Flood in Brooklyn for Rose to immigrate there, he who will arrange a job for her as a clerk in a department store and to live in Mrs. Kehoe's boarding house, as such being immersed within the Irish immigrant population. Rose's actions are despite realizing that she will end up being the sole caregiver for her and Eilis' mother. Despite Father Flood's efforts, he doesn't realize just how homesick Eilis is in being away from her familiar settings, as depressive at it was. Father Flood decides to be more hands on with Eilis, including paying for her tuition to attend night school so that Eilis can expand beyond her clerk job to be come an accountant just like Rose. But arguably what breaks Eilis out of her homesickness is meeting a boy, plumber Tony, at an Irish dance, he who eventually admits that he proverbially crashed the dance in not being Irish, but rather Italian, his family name Fiorello. She discovers that Tony is kind, caring, thoughtful of her feelings, and has fallen in love with her. Eilis can admit to herself and finally to Tony that she too has fallen in love with him. As she finally starts to feel at home in Brooklyn, she is physically and emotionally pulled back to Enniscorthy in a change of situation, which tears her between Enniscorthy and her new life in Brooklyn with Tony, especially problematic as she has told no one in Enniscorthy about him.—Huggo The movie opens in the year 1951 in Enniscorthy, a medium-sized town in County Wexford in southeast Ireland.

She then goes to work at a bakery store, run by the mean old Mrs. Kelly (Brid Brennan), who is very judgmental and critical. Eilis, who had tried to talk to Mrs. Kelly before her shift started but was rebuked, tells her that she is going to America. Her sister contacted a priest in America to sponsor her. She says she can work until she leaves, but is not permitted to do so. Mrs. Kelly guilts her for leaving her sister behind to take care of their mother for the rest of her life.Eilis is at home at dinner with her mother and Rose, who does not think so highly of Mrs. Kelly either. They talk about the weather and about Eilis buying clothes.That evening, Eilis meets up with her best friend Nancy (Eileen O'Higgins). They discuss boys, particularly one boy, George (Peter Campion), who seems to like Nancy. Eilis admits that she didn't put in more effort because she's going away soon. While the two girls are at a social, they awkwardly stand off to the side while couples dance. George comes over to Nancy and asks her to dance. Eilis watches then and then leaves.As Eilis is packing, Rose is surprised that she owns so little and wishes she looked after her better. This is part of the reason why Rose is sending her, because she can't buy Eilis a future.Eilis sets sail while her mother and sister watch, though their mother leaves early. Eilis and Rose cry while they blow each other a kiss. The ship appears to be full of mostly young people, being sent off by the older ones.On the ship, Eilis finds her room, with a bathroom being shared by two girls next door. Her roommate, Georgina (Eva Birthistle), soon comes in to kick her off of the bottom bunk. She declares the cabin Hell and that she should not have come home from America, claiming that she has already traveled to the USA and back to Ireland and is now going back to stay. She invites Eilis out of the room for a cigarette, who refuses saying that she doesn't smoke. Georgina tells Eilis she'll be back soon, unless she finds a man from first class to smoke with.Later, Eilis is the only one eating in the dining hall. She gets sick in the middle of the night and desperately has to use the bathroom, but the other girls had locked it from their side. She leaves her cabin and is forced to use a mop bucket to defecate in and when she comes back to the room, she throws up in a bucket there as well.When Eilis wakes up, her roommate is taking care of her. Georgina forces her way into their bathroom and then blocks the others using it with her suitcase. She then goes to get Eilis water.A day or two later, Eilis and Georgina talk outside on the ship's deck about her going to America. She is feeling better, as it's been hours since she's eaten. Her roommate tells her about America, what it's like, about letters, and how she'll meet people easily where she'll be living, in Brooklyn. When Eilis is eating again, her roommate is shocked by how pale and sick she still looks. She tries to dress her up so she won't be quarantined once she arrives.At immigration, Eilis looks quite different and lovely. Georgina's voice-over tells her how to get through, which involves thinking like an American. As Eilis steps out of a blue door, she is bathed in light.Eilis finds her new place, which is a boarding house where four other young Irish women live, which is run by the delightful gossipy, Mrs. Kehoe (Julie Walters).Eilis walks to Bartocci's, the department store where she now works.

She is told by her supervisor Miss Fortini (Jessica Pare) that she has to treat every customer like a new friend. Eilis keeps to herself and seems awkward. It is clear she misses home.On the day, Eilis had forgotten to check for mail, it turns out she had gotten letters from home. As soon as dinner is done she rushes up to read her letter, from Rose. She cries as she reads the letter.At work, a crying Eilis is still being watched by Miss Fortini. The supervisor asks her if she's crying because it's her time of the month, which it's not. She tells Eilis to take a few minutes off and sends her to the staff room. While there Eilis is approached by the Irish priest who had sponsored her, Father Flood (Jim Broadbent). He had been told she was doing so well that he didn't think she would need looking after. He lets her know that she has enrolled her in a bookkeeping night class at Brooklyn College. He says that they need Irish girls in Brooklyn, and she wishes she were back in Ireland. He assures her that she will feel wretched at first, but that it will then move on.The class does not seem to be an easy one, where they are learning about a Supreme Court case. Eilis is interested and doing well, though, and earnestly takes notes. During the break, a male classmate shares with her how hard he finds it.During dinner at the boarding house, they discuss their Christmas plans. Two of the brash women, Patty (Emily Bett Rickards) and Sheila (Nora-Jane Noone), make fun of Eilis, since she is going to be serving homeless men at the church who have no other place to go.At the church, Father Flood explains to Eilis when she asks that these men don't go home to Ireland because there is nothing there and they've lost touch. As a thank you, a man stands up to sing beautifully in Gaelic, which evokes emotion in Eilis as well as the other men. The music continues overhead during the film as the meal continues and is then cleaned up.Eilis walks home where she is greeted by Mrs. Kehoe. As the two have a drink, Mrs. Kehoe explains that with one girl leaving, Eilis will be offered the best room in the house, the basement, since she is pretty and sensible.
The other girls indeed look differently at Eilis during the next dinner. Patty and Sheila will be going to the movies instead of to a dance. Mrs. Kehoe remarks that hopefully they will have better luck with their new boyfriends than the ones before. Eilis says she will take the new girl, Dolores (Jenn Murray), to the dance.Sure enough, the two girls just sit at an empty dance. Dolores talks about wanting to meet a guy. Patty and Sheila who had said they would go to the movies end up coming to the dance. They bring Eilis to the ladies room to put some lipstick on her and remarks that she looked like she had been milking cows.Eilis is dancing with a boy who is teaching her, though he quickly moves on to another girl. She is then approached by a boy, Tony (Emory Cohen), who had been watching her and they dance, including to a slow song. Tony asks Eilis where she lives and asks to walk her home. She says yes and then explains why, so he won't get the wrong idea. She points to Dolores and says that he'd be rescuing her from Dolores.While they're walking, he admits that he's not Irish, which she already knew. He explains that he's fully Italian-American. He came to the dance because he really likes Irish girls. Eilis makes him nervous as she teases him about if he danced with anyone else. Once Eilis arrives home, he asks to take her out on a date next week. She accepts and says goodnight. He watches her go in and leaves.While Tony and Eilis are out to eat on their first date, Eilis tells him about school and how she wants to be a bookkeeper and eventually an account. She wants to know about his plumbing work, but he would rather hear about bookkeeping, which she goes quite in depth about. She also tells him about Rose. She's been talking so much though that she hasn't eaten much.At the boarding house, Patty and Sheila are all knowingly smiling at Eilis. Mrs. Kehoe criticizes them and says Eilis is right not to say anything to those gossips. When they make fun of Tony's shoes, Mrs. Kehoe says she's going to ask the priest to talk about giddiness, the 8th deadly sin.Another time later, Tony is waiting outside of class for Eilis to take her home. While they're riding on the trolley together, he dances around the question before asking her if she wants to meet his family. He tells her Italian food is the best in the world, which she's never tried. They also make plans to go to the movies.At work, Eilis is now in a much better mood and easily talks to customers. Miss Fortini notices and says she's a different woman. Eilis offers it's because of Tony. Her supervisor says that since he doesn't talk about baseball or his mother too much she should keep him.At the boarding house, Patty and Sheila teach Eilis how to eat spaghetti, which she is trying to do with a fork and a spoon.Eilis writes to Rose about Tony, but asks that she not mention him to their mother. She tells Rose that he helps her feel like she has a life there that she didn't have before.Tony warns Eilis about his younger brother Frankie, who seems to be looking forward to causing trouble, though the family had tried to talk him out of it. At dinner, Eilis is much more of an expert at eating spaghetti, and even tells Tony's mother that she took classes. Frankie then bursts out that they don't like Irish people since one of his brothers got beaten up by an Irish street gang. He is then taken aside by their father.While Eilis shares how she is going to college for bookkeeping and working at the store, Frankie comes back to admit that he was a rude idiot, and they all applaud.One of Tony's brothers asks Eilis if Tony has talked to her about baseball, and they say that's how she'll see him in the summer if she goes with him. Tony is a Dodgers fan and jokes how it will be bad if their kids are Yankees or Giants fans. Frankie points out that Eilis isn't laughing and so must be a Yankees fan.Tony walks Eilis back home. Once they arrive, they hug goodnight. Tony says that he loves her. She thanks him for a lovely evening but is unable to say it back.While Eilis is looking at herself in the bathroom, another girl accidentally comes in. Eilis asks her why she isn't married, which turns out to be because her husband met somebody else and left her. When Eilis asks if she'd get married again, she says she, of course, would. Eilis isn't sure if somebody has asked her.The next time Eilis comes out of class, Tony isn't there. She is about to head home on her own when he shows up late. He seems awkward about last time and even though Eilis wants to talk about it, he changes the subject and talks about the job he had right before he came to that dance. She insists she talk though and lets him know that she loves him back. He was worried they were going to have a totally different kind of talk. Eilis asks him not to talk about their kids being Dodgers fans.Rose writes to Eilis, thanking her for her nylons and talking about her golf tournament. She can't wait to see her one day. Over dinner with their mother she is crying.Eilis brings her grades to Father Flood and says she has saved up enough money to pay for them on her own now, and to pay him back. He remarks how much she's changed.Mrs. Kehoe points out how Eilis is the first girl to have passed exams while living at her house. Eilis shares that Tony is taking her to Coney Island to celebrate. The girls tell her that she'll need to think carefully about her costume. Even Mrs. Kehoe agrees, since it'll be the most he'll have seen of her, and she won't want to turn him off.Eilis' supervisor helps her with bathing suits and comments on her needing to shave down there. She does compliment her full behind though and helps her into a nice green suit.Tony and Eilis seem to be enjoying Coney Island together. At the beach, though, Tony has to hold up a towel so that Eilis can change into her bathing suit. They certainly enjoy swimming and kissing in the water.Eilis writes to Rose to let her know she's really happy in America for the first time, and that it's because of Tony. He took her to a Dodgers game, and she's looking for office jobs. She'll even soon be able to afford coming home for a visit.In Ireland, Eilis and Rose's mother knocks on Rose's door and upon opening it, finds her dead.Back in New York, Eilis is approached by Father Flood while she is at work who tells her that her sister Rose had died back in Ireland. He explains that she likely knew she was sick with a terminal illness but didn't tell anyone. Eilis is upset that they're burying Rose without her being there, and she believes she'll never see her sister again. Father Flood says he thinks she will and that her sister will be watching over her.When the phone rings, Eilis hesitates but picks it up. It is her mother who tells Eilis about the funeral. She makes Eilis cry though with how she has no one. Father Flood comforts her.Eilis cries in Tony's arms while they're out to eat. He understand that she wants to go back to Ireland for her sister's funeral, but is afraid that he won't see her again. He says he wants to take her somewhere.Tony takes her out to Long Island, to an open space where he hopes to build houses for his family and be in a building company with his brothers. He asks Eilis to at least think about it, but she says she doesn't need to.Eilis can't sleep. Her mother back in Ireland is praying the rosary at church dressed in all black. Eilis gets up to go to Tony. She explains she needs to go home for just a month or two. He asks her to marry him before she goes. She's hesitant, but he says if they don't he'll go crazy.Eilis brings Tony to her room where she warns him if he makes any noise she'll get evicted. They make love, and when done they hear footsteps, though they fortunately stop. Eilis has Tony stay the night.The two are all dressed up to get married at City Hall. Tony plays ball with a little boy there and strikes up a conversation with his Irish father. He wants Eilis to meet them, but their name is called. When Tony drops Eilis off at home, they wonder what their children will think about such a story.Some time later, Eilis is back home in Ireland. As she walks out of church with her mother, she sees Nancy, who is engaged to George. Her mother already knew but wanted Eilis to hear it from Nancy. Eilis is invited to the wedding, which is set to take place after Eilis plans to leave, but her mother says she can stay.Eilis brings flowers to Rose's grave, which she is buried in the same plot as their late father (Note: the gravestone lists Eilis and Rose's father, Thomas Lacy, death on March 12, 1947, and Rose's death is listed as July 1, 1952). Eilis talks to Rose's gravestone about Tony and cries about how she wishes everything were different.They go through the letters of condolences with Eilis wondering if she'll keep going back and forth sending thank you notes. Nancy is there, and her mother sends her off.Nancy isn't there with their other friend Annette though, as Eilis had been expecting. Rather she and George have brought another young man along, Jimmy.Once they arrive at the rugby club, Eilis asks why Jimmy is there, who had broken off an engagement with another girl because he didn't think she was serious enough. She reminds Nancy that she's going back to the United States, but Nancy assures her she can have fun before they go back.While walking with Jimmy, he tells Eilis that he went to Rose's funeral and that her death was the saddest thing that happened in town. His mother knew her since they were in the golf club together. While talking to Nancy, George, and Jimmy, Eilis distinguishes how she lives in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan, which isn't very glamorous. Since she wants to be a bookkeeper like her sister, Jimmy says she should do some work before she goes back. George accuses him of wanting Eilis to stay, but Jimmy says he's just thinking of Eilis.Her mother is still up and asks about her evening and asks about Jimmy. He'll have his house to his own soon, and her mother says he's a catch. Eilis just says goodnight.Eilis returns home from shopping. She is told that she needs to go straightaway to her sister's old place of work to fix an accounting issue. It's a terrible mess for Eilis to work out. She makes it clear she'll make a system for the person after her and will not be staying.The boss comes into compliment Eilis. He asks about her certificate and wants her to continue working there part-time and that they will speak again, even though she's going back. The grave is now filled, and Eilis continues to bring flowers.Eilis goes to the beach with Nancy, George, and Jimmy. Since it's so different from Brooklyn, Jimmy wants to know if they must seem backward to Eilis, but she tells him they seem calm, civilized, and charming.Jimmy tells Eilis there will be a prize in Rose's name at the local golf club. They want Eilis to present the first prize and Jimmy's mother also wants to meet her. Eilis mentions she wishes it were like this before Rose died.While the other three have to change into their bathing suits under their towels, Eilis already has her bathing suit on. They remark it must be an American trick.Tony wants help from Frankie writing out his letter to Eilis, since he's written so many, and she's only written back once. While Tony's letter is read aloud, Eilis seems to be getting along just fine in Ireland, including with Jimmy.Eilis comes home to find a letter from Tony. She doesn't even read it but rather puts it in her drawer with the rest of the unopened letters.Jimmy and Eilis are having lunch. She remarks that he looks different and jokingly ask if he's come to trick her. He admits that his life must seem very easy to her and others, but it doesn't feel like that.

Eilis thanks him, is grateful and flattered, she just envisioned a different life. He understands but says her life could be just as good or better. They embrace.Eilis is fetched by one of her former co-workers to go back to her old boss, Mrs. Kelly, to talk. She wants to know how she's been getting on with her job and Jimmy, but Eilis says it's just talk. She shares how a customer, Mrs. Brady, has a relative living in Brooklyn and so she knows Eilis was getting married.Eilis says she has forgotten what this town is like and asks what Mrs. Kelly was asking her to do and assures her that her name is her married name.Eilis composes herself outside and walks over to make the next reservation for New York.Eilis' mother is just chattering away until she notices Eilis and thinks something happened with Jimmy. Eilis breaks down and apologizes for not telling her about Tony, but she wants to be with him.

Her mother hopes she'll write about him and says goodnight.Eilis looks around her room as she packs up her things.

Which makes them wonder about their relationship.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel comes to the big screen in this romantic drama from director George Tillman Jr.. The plot centers on the star-crossed love affair between a retired bull rider who wants to get back in the saddle, and an art student preparing to seek her fortune in New York City. As their relationship is put to the ultimate test, the wisdom of an aging man who recalls his lost love serves as a source of great inspiration. Scott Eastwood, Britt Robertson, Jack Huston, and Alan Alda star. In the opening scene, Luke (Scott Eastward) is riding a bull and falling off of it; the commentators seem concerned as his fall seemed unsafe.Then the movie cuts to Sophia, a young college student at Wake Forest College. She is in her room at her sorority house with her best friend handing her a pair of boots and begging her to come to a bull riding competition. Her friend calls her boring and tells her that she can't spend her whole life studying. She - relenting - goes to the competition and watches Luke (and several other riders) ride the Bulls. Luke is attempting to make a comeback at the championship after his fall. He rides the bull for the required amount of time and dismounts. As he waves to the crowd the bull charges in his direction, so he heads to the rails, in his rush his hat falls into the lap of Sophia, and he tells her to keep it. Later that night while everyone is drunk at the bar, Sophia heads outside and runs into Luke, who recognizes his hat and says ""hi"". They are both about to make their way inside for a drink, but Sophia runs into her friend who is noticeably drunk and feels sick. They all agree it's best for Sophia to take her friend home. Luke takes Sophia's number.Luke calls Sophia, but she doesn't answer because she has an upcoming art internship in New York after she graduates in two months and doesn't think it worthwhile to pursue a relationship. Her friend (who was drunk in the bar that night) convinces her to call him as all the sorority girls would like to be with a handsome bull rider like that. He takes her out to a secluded lake and brings some delicious barbecue take out for them to eat. On the ride home, though it's pouring outside, Luke notices some missing rails on a bridge, reverses and runs towards a car- It's on fire, and an elderly passenger is inside. As he is rescuing the old man, he keeps yelling about saving a box in the front seat. Sophia grabs the box, and they take him to the hospital. Sophia agrees to stay behind with the elderly gentleman and they part ways as Sophia explained to him earlier that she won't be in town for much longer.While in the waiting room, Sophia opens the box and discovers a lot of letters. She opens one and finds that it's addressed from a young Ira to his late wife, Ruth. When he's out of surgery, Sophia introduces herself and hands him the box. The old man is not eating his food so she says she'll read him one of the letters (as his eyesight is not a good as it used to be) if he eats. While eating we cut to a scene with a young Ira being introduced to a young immigrant Ruth from Austria, at his parents' store; he is at a loss for words.Ira observes her around town but doesn't approach her out of shyness. He finally summons up the courage to approach her with a rose in his hand, but sees another young man talking to her and so throws away the Rose as he walks off, but she sees him as he walks away. Another day at a joint gathering she approaches him and wonders why he hasn't said ""hi"" even though he always stares at her, she said it's a shame he threw away the rose.In the present day, Sophia asks old Ira if he would like her to read another letter but as he is crying he asks her to do it another time. Sophia comes back to visit old Ira regularly and so the rest of the movie is intertwined with scenes of Ira and Ruth and the present. Luke continues to ride bulls and is shown throughout the movie in a series of competitions climbing the ranks, and his aim is to be number one. Driving home one day, he notices a picture in his car of young Ira and Ruth and so goes back to the hospital to return the picture to the old man, where he runs into Sophia. As he turns to leave Sophia asks him to go out sometime and he accepts. He tells her he'll take her bull riding, but she agrees to ride a horse.They go home to his ranch and after a day of horseback riding she dares him to a race but before he can stop her she runs right into the lake hidden behind the grass. He takes her inside to change and have a shower. As she is entering the bathroom, he offers her soup when she gets out. While undressing they both notice that the door is slightly open, so she takes off her clothes slowly making eye contact with him. He joins her, and they have sex in the shower.Ruth and Ira continue courting enjoying dates on the beach and at art galleries. One day she pulls him into a hotel lobby and shows him an arty picture and explains how beautiful it is and her interpretation of it. He is also shown having dinner with her family one night where we learn that art is looked upon highly in her family. He proposes to her one day on the beach, and she says that she wants a large family. It is then shown that he is called off to serve in the war; they are both sad, but she promises to wait for him til he returns. While in the middle of the battlefield one of his fellow wounded soldiers calls for help. Many of his colleagues are hiding in a ditch as shots and bombs are being fired, so they see helping him a suicide mission. Ira decides to help against the warning of a colleague. He grabs the wounded soldier but is shot on the way although they both make it to safety.Next he is shown in the hospital, and while he is still alive he is sent home but the reason is not yet known. Upon arriving home he is shown outside Ruth's home but doesn't have the courage to enter. She approaches him in a diner saying that his mom called to tell Ruth that he has been home for a few days, and she is upset as he hasn't called her. She demands to know why he won't talk to her as she waited all that time for him and wanted to marry him. He reveals that the injury left him unable to have kids and said that he can't give her the family that she wants so she should continue without him. She says that she loves him and will marry him regardless. On one of their dates he takes her to an open house and asks her if she likes it, she says yes and he reveals the keys in his hands and inside the house he reveals the painting she loved from the hotel lobby. They hang it in the house.Sophia and Luke are now in a relationship. While talking to his mom one day at home, she reveals that his father was also a bull rider who passed away several years ago. Luke rides Bulls as a way to keep the ranch and his mom afloat. Sophia's boss calls her and tells her that the New York art dealer will be in Charlotte that weekend and asks if she'd be interested in meeting him, she says yes. On leaving to meet the art curator she receives a call from Luke's friend and finds out that he took a rough fall and is in the hospital. She calls her boss to let her know she can't make it this weekend.While at the hospital, she hears the doctor warn Luke not to ride again, as he was warned against riding after his serious injury (for which he has a scar on his chest) at the beginning of the movie. Sophia is concerned as she cares about Luke, and doesn't want him to harm himself, upon being discharged from the hospital she assumes he will stop riding bulls but when he tells her he won't she breaks up with him as she can't be with him if he is harming himself unnecessarily especially after she called her boss to cancel both the meeting this weekend and her upcoming internship so they could be together. His mom says that he is making a mistake letting her go as she is the rest of his life. When he explains that he does it for his mom, she says she will make it without the ranch and that the only person he is doing it for is himself.Sophia meets with Ira at his home as he has been discharged from the hospital. She learns that adoption was not as easy in those days so Ruth took a job as a school teacher so she could be around kids. Though it is shown that it still isn't enough for her. She notices a kid asleep in class one day and it is obvious that he needs a bath, she visits his home to find that his impoverished half brother looks after for him and neither he nor his wife care much for the boy. Ruth takes extra care of the boy bringing him home after school and feeding him some days. Ruth and Ira become attached to the boy and look into adopting him, but his half-brother says no. She cries and says there must be another way, but Ira says that his lawyer said there was no other way. This is a small town, and his brother is legal guardian so there is no way they will win in court. Upon bringing the boy to his family for the last time, she tells him that he can be anything he wants to be a farmer, a scientist a lawyer. Whatever he wants to be as he is a smart young boy.This loss and Ira's level headed approach to the situation is too much for Ruth as she considered the boy a part of their family. She packs her bag and leaves as she wants children too badly. Ira cries but loves her enough to want her happy and so lets her leave. She comes back a few days later, and they grown old together, continuing to collect art and have adventures until one morning in their old age Ruth doesn't wake up. After her funeral, Ira says that a woman showed up to his door, she is the wife of the young man Daniel they wanted to adopt. She reveals that he has passed on but was not only a teacher but professor at University College of London; she returned to America after he died. He was inspired by Ira's wife who told him as a child that he could be whatever he wanted to be. Words that clearly struck a chord with him and so upon reading Ruth's name in the obituary she felt compelled to visit. She hands him a framed portrait. While the portrait is not shown, a picture of Ruth and Ira stuck to it is. This is the same picture Ira had with him the night of the accident.Cut to present day, when Luke is ranked number five in the world and is competing for the championship. From the hat pick, it is shown that he will ride the number 1 bull for the championship. His hand is still shaky from his accident, but he rides the bull and the entire time he is looking in the audience to the empty seat where Sophia usually sits. He rides the bull long enough and is now ranked number 1 rider in the world. Sophia receives a call one day and is notified that Ira has died, she starts crying but is invited to an invitation only auction for his art the following week. Luke also receives an invitation in the mail. Apparently, Ruth has an eye for art, and amassed a large collection throughout their lifetime, which Ira took down after she died because the painting were a permanent reminder of her and too painful to bear. They have Warhols and other paintings by famous artists in their collection as Ruth was great at identifying young talent.Luke arrives late and stands to the back of the room while the first picture goes to auction, it is a picture of Ruth painted by Daniel. The auctioneer offers $1,000 with no takers and so goes down to $800 with still no takers. At $600 Luke purchases the picture, and Sophia is surprised to see him. The auction is on hold until he finalizes the purchase, and in the other room, Sophia says ""hi"". He tells her that all thought he wanted was to be the #1 bull rider, but the entire time he was riding the bull, he was thinking of her. He realizes that she is his life, and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They kiss and can't keep their hands off each other til the curator calls them up. The auction was put on hold as Ira's lawyer reveals that the entire collection now belongs to the owner of the picture of Ruth. He reads a letter from Ira explaining that Ruth was his heart and his entire life belonged to her so the entire collection will go along with the painting of the love of his life Ruth. Luke is unsure what the hysteria breaking out in the room is about as people start asking him how much he wants for the pictures. Sophia grabs his hand and explains that he is now a millionaire.In the final scene, Sophia is seen at a art gallery surrounded by Ira's pictures and is shown locking the door to the room and jumping into a car with Luke. The building she left is the 'Ira and Ruth Levinson Museum'."

Claire mentions that she teaches classic literature at school, prompting Noah to quote Homer and express his love for ""The Iliad"". Claire is clearly impressed by this. Later, Noah notices a pair of stilettos that Claire keeps in a box, which she says were a gift from Vicky. Noah comments that the shoes are for women who try to be sexy, and that Claire doesn't need to try. He apologizes for sounding too forward.With Kevin and Garrett away on their trip, Claire is getting ready to go out. She looks out the window and sees Noah naked in his room.

She says there was a big rainstorm, to which Noah smugly remarks that it got very wet over there. Kevin offers him a cookie, and Noah responds, ""I love your mother's cookies.""The school year begins, and as Claire begins her first class, the principal comes in and tells her that Noah is joining their class, since he made it appear as though Claire requested him to transfer into her class.

He leaves as she expels him.Claire chaperones the fall fling and leaves Kevin with Allie. Allie tells Claire about a leak in the boy's bathroom. She goes to turn the sink off and sees in big letters on the wall, ""I fucked Claire Peterson"". Noah emerges from the darkness and tries to force himself on Claire, only to get kicked in the balls. She tells him to stay away from her and Kevin.The next day, Claire's students are locked out of the class. She opens the door and looks inside to see something awful.

He turns his car around, prompting Vicky to call Claire, just as she is breaking into Noah's house. She finds the camera hidden behind a clock above the fireplace. She walks into the basement and finds hundreds of pictures of herself all over the walls. Claire looks into Noah's laptop and finds the video and picture files. She trashes all of it, and then spots two other files with pictures of brakes, implying that Noah was the one that cut the brakes out of Garrett's car, as well as from a minivan. Claire goes back upstairs and is startled when Noah's uncle shows up. She runs back home.Claire meets with a detective and learns that Noah's parents were killed in a car accident after his dad swerved into a truck.

An orphan boy (Levi Miller) discovers his destiny as Peter Pan in this vividly-realized fantasy and is whisked away to an enchanted land to battle the fearsome pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) with the help of the warrior woman Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara).. In the opening scene, a young woman named Mary (Amanda Seyfried) brings her baby to the steps of the Lambert Home For Boys in London. She leaves the boy with a note and a necklace of a pan flute. Mary kisses her baby, Peter, and tells him she loves him before leaving.12 years later.Peter (Levi Miller) is still living at the Lambert Home, and he has only one friend, Nibs (Lewis MacDougall). Their time is made miserable by the cruel nun Mother Barnabas (Kathy Burke). Peter figures out that Barnabas is hoarding extra food for herself, so he and Nibs break into her office and uncover her stash of extra food and coins. The boys go into her private records and find Peter's file, which contains a letter from Mary that reaffirms her love for her son and says they will see each other again, in this world or another.While the boys sleep at night, some are snatched up into the air by men coming down on tethers. They were summoned by Barnabas, who raised a pirate flag at the top of the orphanage. Peter sees Nibs being grabbed, so he runs to save his friend. Peter ends up being taken after Barnabas kicks him into the path of one of the pirates. The boys are out on the ship, but Nibs jumps off and lands on the roof. As the ship flies toward the sky, Royal Army planes fly after the ship and shoot at it. The planes retreat once the ship rises above the clouds.Peter ties himself to the ship to keep from falling out. He floats through space and touches Saturn before getting yanked back to the ship. It flies all the way to Neverland. There, the boys are brought before a large quarry where the workers are singing ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". Atop another floating ship emerges the dreaded pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman). He tells the boys they are digging for fairy dust in the mines.While working, Peter meets James Hook (Garrett Hedlund), an older man and fellow slave worker that's been there as long as he can remember, and that's why he's grumpy and disillusioned. Peter then finds a rock of fairy dust that an older man swipes from him. Peter argues with the man and insults his cohorts, leading to Blackbeard making Peter walk the plank along with two other boys that misbehaved. Blackbeard kicks Peter off the plank, but as he falls, Peter suddenly starts flying, to everyone's surprise, until he drops to the ground.Peter wakes up in a room in Blackbeard's ship. The pirate walks in and tells Peter of a prophet that states that a boy who can fly will fight Blackbeard and kill him. Peter says he doesn't believe in bedtime stories.Hook gets Peter and his accomplice Mr. Smee (Adeel Akhtar) to escape and try to make their way to one of Blackbeard's boats, on the condition that Hook helps Peter find his mother. They ride a cart up to the floating boats, only to get pulled back by Blackbeard's right hand man Bishop (Nonso Anozie). Peter cuts the wire and sends himself, Hook, and Smee toward one of the boats.The three ride the boat into the forest to find the natives. They are caught by a group of the natives, led by Princess Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara). Hook and Smee are almost executed until the Chief (Jack Charles) notices the pan flute around Peter's neck. Because the pan is the symbol of their tribe, the natives bow to Peter. Tiger Lily explains to Peter that his mother fell in love with the fairy prince, which made Blackbeard jealous, though it also means that Peter is part fairy. The natives helped bring Mary to the fairy kingdom to protect her, so that's where Peter can find her. Now, they just want to prove that Peter really is her son, so he needs to fly. However, Peter is unable to recreate the same flight as before, causing him to lose hope.Blackbeard and his men attack the natives after Smee cowardly gives away the location of the heroes. The pirates battle the natives, and Blackbeard ends up killing the Chief. He finds Peter and reveals that he killed Mary. Peter escapes with Hook and Tiger Lily.The three head toward the fairy kingdom on a raft. Peter is devastated to learn that Tiger Lily lied to him about his mother. Suddenly, a large crocodile attacks the group. Peter falls into the water and is dragged to the bottom by the crocodile, until a trio of mermaids (all played by Cara Delevignge) send the croc away and bring Peter back up to the surface. Peter then has a vision of his mother as a warrior, leading the natives and fairies to safety from Blackbeard. He sees Mary fighting Blackbeard until the pirate ran her through with his sword, and he screamed in regret and sorrow. Later, Hook leaves the two because he doesn't want to be there when they lose the battle.Peter and Tiger Lily locate the fairy kingdom, but unfortunately, Blackbeard had followed them. He takes the pan necklace from Peter and uses it as the key to enter the fairy kingdom. He ties the heroes to the ship as they enter. The fairies fly around the good guys, and Peter befriends one such fairy named Tinker Bell. The heroes break free and fight the pirates, with Hook returning on his own ship to join the battle. The three fight the pirates, with Hook taking on Bishop while Tiger Lily fights Blackbeard. Smee escapes on a boat. Hook's ship tilts over, causing Bishop to fall to his death in the abyss, while Hook hangs on. Realizing he won't make it, he lets go. Blackbeard taunts Peter until the boy jumps and flies to rescue Hook. After doing so, the fairies help fight the pirates, sending them off the ships to their doom. The fairies then swarm all over Blackbeard and cause his ship to crash into a wall, plunging it into the abyss, taking Blackbeard with it.A vision of Mary appears to Peter. He still doesn't believe he is the hero that was prophecized, but his mother disagrees and restates her love for her son, calling him her little ""Peter Pan."" As she disappears, Tiger Lily hugs Peter.The heroes return to London on Hook's new ship, the Jolly Roger, to gather Nibs and the rest of the orphaned boys to become the new Lost Boys, to the anger of Barnabas. As they fly back to Neverland, Peter asks Hook if they'll always be friends. Hook responds: ""Sure. What could go wrong?"""
Concussion,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3322364/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In Pittsburgh, accomplished pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu uncovers the truth about brain damage in football players who suffer repeated concussions in the course of normal play. Will Smith stars in Concussion, a dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu, the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known. Omalu's emotional quest puts him at dangerous odds with one of the most powerful institutions in the world.—Sony Pictures Entertainment The film opens with a footage of football player Mike Webster (David Morse), showing him in action during games in playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the man speaking in a conference. In the present time, September 2002, Mike is homeless and living in his car, suffering from dementia.Nigerian pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu (Will Smith) is giving a testimony in court over a murder case. Based on his research, he determines that the blood on the defendant's hands was not that of the victim's because the defendant is a hemophiliac and could not risk something for possibility of injury or death.Bennet works at the coroner's office in Allegehney county where he has an odd habit of speaking to the deceased so that he can get an idea as to what it is that killed them. He is friends at work with Gracie (Sara Lindsey) but is antagonized by Danny (Mike O'Malley). Bennet also tends to throw away knives after being used once. He is called into the office of his boss, Dr. Cyril Wecht (Albert Brooks) over this. Bennet asks Cyril if he would like it if Bennet cut his mother open with the same knife he used on a serial killer. Cyril says yes, and that he would personally ask him to do so.Bennet is asked to provide care for a young immigrant woman named Prema Mutiso (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). He takes her to his home and offers her some money, which she appears to find offensive. Bennet explains to her that it's okay to need money and that it doesn't make her weak, but in America, sometimes it is necessary to fake it in order to get ahead.Webster visits Dr. Julian Bailes (Alec Baldwin) over his condition. He appears to be getting worse. Webster is visited at his car by fellow football player Justin Strzelczyk (Matthew Willig), who is also suffering from a similar condition. Webster complains that he doesn't want to go to sleep, so he is seeing tasing himself to stay awake. He is later found dead.Mike Webster's death shocks the city. His body is brought in for Bennet to examine. He observes that Webster pulled out his teeth and superglued them back together. Bennet takes a look at Webster's brain and discovers severe head trauma that led to his mental deterioration. He brings this to Cyril's attention. Bennet furthers his research by studying football videos and noticing the amount of times someone like Webster took serious blows to the head.Bennet and Prema spend the night out and quickly fall in love. Bennet later proposes to her and they are married, and later are expecting their first child.Strzcelczyk is seen ready to attack his wife and children, claiming that the voices in his head are telling him to kill them. His wife screams at him to get out, and he drives away. He turns up dead, and another football player, Terry Long, is reported to have died from drinking antifreeze. Bennet examines them as well and concludes that the men suffered from CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy). He presents his research to Dr. Steven DeKosky (Eddie Marsan) and Dr. Ron Hamilton (Stephen Moyer), who reluctantly agree with him. After word of this gets out, it is believed that Bennet is trying to shame football, earning him a number of enemies. He is told to retract his statements, saying that he made it all up to harm the NFL's reputation. He does, however, receive support from Julian, who distances himself from the NFL's actions.Meanwhile, Dave Duerson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is approached by fellow player Andre Waters (Richard T. Jones). Waters is suffering from a mental condition as well and begs Duerson to help him, but Duerson leaves him and walks away. Waters is later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.One evening at a restaurant, Bennet and Julian meet with Dr. Joseph Maroon (Arliss Howard) over the matter. He chastises Bennet and thinks he is trying to destroy football, although Bennet continuously urges him to tell the truth that could prevent other football players from suffering similar fates to the recently departed.Roger Goodell (Luke Wilson) is made the new commissioner of the NFL. Bennet is called upon to speak at a summit for concussion. However, Julian later tells him that they don't want Bennet to speak, but rather for Julian to speak since he was the NFL's neurological consultant, leading the two men to conflict. Furthermore, two corrupt FBI agents shows up to Bennet's job to indict Cyril on multiple charges for supporting Bennet's work, while also coming for Bennet by threatening to deport him back to Nigeria. Bennet decides he must resign and look for work in another state.Prema is driving by herself when she feels that someone is following her. She makes a detour and loses the car, but she experiences a problem. She is taken to the hospital and joined by Bennet, where they are told that the doctors cannot find a heartbeat from the baby. After Bennet is forced to sell his home, he breaks down, feeling utterly defeated.Three years later, Bennet and Prema are living in Lodi, California with their daughter. Bennet is called by Julian when Dave Duerson commits suicide and requested that his brain be examined.Bennet speaks before a group of people on his research, while also simultaneously admiring the sport of football. Talks of CTE begin flowing through the country, sparking comparisons between tobacco companies and their denial of the links between their products and bad health. Bennet is redeemed, and he is offered a job in Washington DC. In the final scene, he later drives by a school during football practice and watches as two players run head-to-head into each other.The final text states that Bennet Omalu turned down the Washington job and remained in California with Prema Mutiso and their two children. Multiple retired NFL players filed lawsuits against the NFL for concealing information on concussed football players. The NFL settled on the condition that it would not have to disclose that it knew, and when, on the effects of concussion on football players. It was later determined that 28% of football players have or will suffer from CTE. All charges against Cyril Wecht were dropped. In February 2015, Bennet Omalu officially became a US citizen."

However, things will take a turn for the unexpected, when Cooper is assigned to escort and guard Daniella Riva (Sofia Vergara)--the curvaceous trophy-wife of a Colombian drug lord--who is going to testify against an infamous cartel boss. Suddenly--as trigger-happy criminals and corrupt officers of the law are closing in on the two women--the road to Dallas seems very long, and very dangerous, especially when Rose and Daniella can only depend on each other to survive.

However, as an adult, her drive for her work has made her too intense in her personal life. While out on a date, she scares the guy away after she defensively pulls a gun on him. She chases him down just to give him back his wallet.At the station, Cooper is brought in to meet Detective Jackson (Richard T. Jones).

As the once-contented senior wages a monumental struggle to regain her confidence, she gradually turns her efforts toward knocking cruel class queen bee Madison (Bella Thorne) from her throne up on high.. For a long time, high school students have been stuck with the typical labels - jocks, princesses, nerds, divas, geeks, dweebs, rejects, etc. In recent years, these students have now branched out from their stereotypes. As high school senior Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) explains, now jocks play video games, the princesses are on anti-depressants, and the nerds are in charge. We then see the short, slightly-overweight unattractive Bianca walking down the halls with her two attractive best friends: Jessica 'Jess' Harris (Skyler Samuels), an aspiring fashion designer, and Casey Cordero (Bianca A. Santos), a tough computer hacker girl. All the guys drool over Jess and Casey, but nobody ever really acknowledges Bianca.The school's ruthless mean-girl queen bee Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to a party at her house, and deliberately chooses not to invite Bianca, until Casey makes it so that there's a free invitation. Here, we also meet Bianca's neighbor and former friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), captain of the football team and Madison's on/off boyfriend. Bianca also has a crush on a guy named Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman), but she is too scared to say more than two words to him.The supervisor of the school newspaper and Bianca's teacher, Mr. Arthur (Ken Jeong), assigns her the task of writing an article for the school newspaper on the upcoming homecoming dance and what social life means to her. She reluctantly agrees to it.At home, we meet Bianca's mom Dottie (Allison Janney), who became a successful author after her divorce. She was inspired by an episode of ""The Simpsons"" to create a book on the five stages of dealing with divorce. She, along with Jess and Casey, convince Bianca to go to the party, despite her hesitance.At the party, Wes runs into Bianca and asks her if Jess and Casey have mentioned him or are interested in him. Bianca says it's not her job to divulge information on her friends, to which Wes argues that it is as their DUFF. Wes explains to a confused Bianca that it stands for the ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"", and that a DUFF is there to make their friends look better by comparison. They are approachable enough for someone to ask them about their hot friends, and Bianca fits this role. Offended, she throws her drink in Wes's face. She goes home alone feeling insecure and self-conscious.Throughout the rest of the day, the thought of being a DUFF bugs Bianca until she realizes that everyone only talks to her to get closer to Jess and Casey. She even notices all the other social cliques at school with their own DUFF. It gets to a point where Bianca confronts Jess and Casey about being their DUFF. Despite their assurance that they don't see her like that, Bianca spitefully unfollows them from every form of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, etc.) and decides she doesn't want to be friends with them at all.Bianca notices that Wes is failing chemistry. She sees this as an opportunity for the two of them to help each other out. She offers to tutor Wes if he agrees to turn her image around so that she won't be a DUFF. Wes agrees, but only if Bianca asks him in her monster voice from when they were kids. She does.Wes joins Bianca at the local shopping mall where he first gets her to dress in a more flattering manner. As Bianca tries on different outfits, she fools around with a mannequin and pretends it's Toby. From afar, Madison's minion Caitlyn (Rebecca Weil) films this and sends the video to Madison. Wes then challenges Bianca to go around the mall and talk to a bunch of random guys for her to get over her fear of talking to Toby. It goes awkwardly for a while until one guy from a frozen yogurt stand talks to Bianca for a while.The next day, the video of Bianca at the mall goes viral throughout the school. Everybody points and laughs at her, forcing her to run into the bathroom and cry. Mr. Arthur and Principal Buchanon (Romany Malco) take notice of this and demand everybody turn in their cell phones to prevent further cyberbullying, which only turns everyone against Bianca even more since they blame her for the loss of their gadgets. Jess and Casey also see the video, and Casey gets rid of the video. The phones are returned to the students when the constant ringing bothers Buchanon.Wes comes over to Bianca's house to apologize for not stopping the video and for not defending her. He gives her a dress that she had her eye on at the mall. He tells her not to let the video get to her and that she should approach Toby personally and admit how she feels. Wes then promises to go out and continue studying.Bianca approaches Toby at school after being previously humiliated by the video. She tells him she's into him, and he invites her to go over to his house to hang out.Bianca takes Wes into the nearby woods to her ""thinking rock"" so he can tell her how to handle herself on a date. He explains how the mood should be set and how Toby would act if he is trying to go for a kiss. Wes ends up kissing Bianca, but they laugh it off as just practice. Once again, Caitlyn is in the distance filming this with her video phone. Madison then approaches Bianca at school the next day and threatens to post another video at the mall of Bianca's awkward encounter with the guys since Madison doesn't like Bianca hanging around Wes.Another evening or two later, Bianca goes to Toby's house for dinner. He puts out sushi and talks about how he got into writing songs. However, Bianca cannot stop thinking about Wes. She goes to the bathroom and tries to convince herself that she's not into him. Outside, Toby plays an awkwardly-written song for Bianca and then asks about Jess and Casey. Bianca slowly realizes that Toby is DUFF-ing her, and he admits he only invited Bianca over because he thought Jess and Casey would be joining them. Bianca leaves and then sees that Toby bought the sushi from another place instead of cooking it like he made it seem. Bianca goes home and leaves a message for Wes. She walks by the woods and sees him and Madison sitting on her rock, kissing. Wes comes over later to comfort Bianca, only to be turned away after she tells him what she saw.Depressed, Bianca tries to write her article, only to become lonely. She decides to make amends with Jess and Casey. The two of them, along with Dottie, convince Bianca to go with them to homecoming. Jess makes Bianca a dress using Bianca's flannel shirt and another dress.The three girls go to the homecoming dance, and everyone is stunned by Bianca's new look, including Wes. She goes over to him and admits that she's into him. Madison catches them talking and threatens to post the video, but Bianca is no longer fazed by it. She says that it won't bother her and that she doesn't care about labels the way Madison does. Bianca adds that everyone is a DUFF since there will always be someone prettier or more popular, but that shouldn't bother anybody. Moments later, Wes and Madison are crowned homecoming king and queen. Madison gladly accepts the crown, but Wes rejects it and goes over to kiss Bianca in front of everyone. They leave to go hook up in the computer room.Bianca writes her article on being a DUFF, which is a hit with the students. She and Wes become a couple in the end, and she becomes a more confident person that doesn't let a label define her."
Woman in Gold,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2404425/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Maria Altmann, an octogenarian Jewish refugee, takes on the Austrian government to recover artwork she believes rightfully belongs to her family. Maria Altmann (Dame Helen Mirren) sought to regain a world famous painting of her aunt plundered by the Nazis during World War II. She did so not just to regain what was rightfully hers, but also to obtain some measure of justice for the death, destruction, and massive art theft perpetrated by the Nazis.—Elyse J. Factor In a series of flashbacks throughout the movie, Maria Altmann (Dame Helen Mirren) recalls the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna, and the subsequent persecution of the Jewish community and the looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann (Tatiana Maslany) and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband, Fritz (Max Irons), are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna. In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the Nazis. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the ""Woman in Gold"". A dramatization of the fight by JewishMaria Altmannnée Bloch-Bauer (Dame Helen Mirren), with the help of lawyerE. Randol Schoenberg(Ryan Reynolds) to reclaim items stolen from her family in Austria by the Nazis during World War II, including some paintings byGustav Klimt, most notably one better known as ""Woman in Gold"" (a painting of Maria's aunt,Adele Bloch-Bauer) which has been hanging in the Belvedere Museum in Vienna since the end of the war, and which is considered a national Austrian treasure, is presented. A young Maria (Tatiana Maslany) and her husbandFritz Altmann(Max Irons) were able to escape from what was the total Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Austria during the war eventually to live in Los Angeles. Maria has been unable to reconcile what happened during the war with being a native Austrian, contempt what she feels for Austria and the Austrian peoples. Maria hired young and relatively inexperienced Randy, the grandson of composerArnold Schönberg, and the son of a family friend, following the death of her older sister Luise, and discovering amongst her possessions that she was planning on taking some form of legal action with the recently instituted Restitution Committee in Austria. Only now getting back on track with his career after some earlier missteps, Randy takes the case solely for the potential financial gain in light of ""Woman in Gold""'s market value. Even then, Randy has to convince his new bosses to allow him to work on this case, which may eventually have high profile, but little chance of success. In Vienna, Maria and Randy find an ally in Viennese investigative journalistHubertus Czernin(Daniel Brühl), who tells them that the Committee is largely a sham that makes the conditions so prohibitively stringent as for no one being able to succeed. They will also find that the Austrian government generally and the administrators of the Belvedere have no intention of giving up, especially the Klimts, without a fight. Beyond these obstacles, Maria and Randy also have to discover if they do have a legal foot on which to stand regarding whether the paintings rightfully belong to Maria. As Maria and Randy hit one roadblock after another, Randy gains a new appreciation for the case in his affection for Maria and in coming to terms as being a descendant of Holocaust survivors. In Randy discovering alternative legal channels in which to pursue as those at the Belvedere refuse to negotiate, they all know that the Belvedere has one other important factor on their side: that they can drag out whatever legal proceedings as long as need be for elderly Maria to die before any legal decision is made.—Huggo In a series of flashbacks throughout the film, Maria Altmann recalls the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna, and the subsequent suppression of the Jewish community and the looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna.
In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Altmann family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the Nazis. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the ""Woman in Gold"".
Altmann enlists the help of Randol Schoenberg, the grandson of her close friends, but a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the art restitution board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was in fact legitimately willed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist Hubertus Czernin, this claim proves to be incorrect, as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting in question, the artist's fee having been paid by her uncle. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board, but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States.
Months thereafter, happening upon an art book with ""Woman in Gold"" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retroactively applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the Supreme Court of the United States, where in the matter of Republic of Austria v. Altmann, the court rules in Altmann's favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of an arbitration panel of three arbiters in Vienna.
In Austria, the arbitration panel hears the case, during which time they are reminded of the Nazi Regime's war crimes by Schoenberg. Schoenberg implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word restitution and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings. The Austrian government representative makes a last minute proposal begging Altmann to keep the paintings in the Belvedere against a generous compensation. Altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the United States with her (""They will now travel to America like I once had to as well""), and takes up an offer made earlier by Ronald Lauder to acquire them for his New York gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.

The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2555736/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has only a single remaining vacancy, posing a rooming predicament for two fresh arrivals, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) pursues his expansionist dream of opening a second hotel. The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the expansionist dream of Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), and it's making more claims on his time than he has available, considering his imminent marriage to the love of his life, Sunaina (Tina Desai). Sonny has his eye on a promising property now that his first venture, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful, has only a single remaining vacancy, posing a rooming predicament for fresh arrivals Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) and Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig). Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) and Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) have now joined the Jaipur workforce, and are wondering where their regular dates for Chilla pancakes will lead, while Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) and Carol Parr (Diana Hardcastle) are negotiating the tricky waters of an exclusive relationship, as Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) juggles two eligible and very wealthy suitors. Perhaps the only one who may know the answers is newly installed co-manager of the hotel, Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith), the keeper of everyone's secrets. As the demands of a traditional Indian wedding threaten to engulf them all, an unexpected way forward presents itself.—Fox Searchlight It's been eight months since the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, India, has been in its current model, with the original British pensioner residents minus Graham (Tom Wilkinson), and Douglas Ainslie's (Bill Nighy's) now estranged wife Jean (Dame Penelope Wilton), still there and immersed in South Asian life for all of its good and bad. In both the good and bad categories, they all, minus Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith), are facing emotional issues of the heart in one form or another, which are somewhat affected by their professional commitments. Meanwhile, the hotel is victim of its own success, and as such, the world is seemingly Sonny Kapoor's (Dev Patel's) oyster. He is financially secure enough that he and Sunaina (Tina Desai) can now get married. But he and his business partner Muriel believe they need to expand to a second property, that property which they have chosen and has long been on the market. They are looking for an investor, they believing being a franchise of Evergreen, an American based conglomerate specializing in seniors facilities, the best way to proceed. Evergreen's response is that they will send someone to Jaipur to investigate on their behalf. Sonny is certain the Evergreen representative is an American who checks into the hotel without a reservation, Guy Chambers (Richard Gere), despite Guy stating that he is an aspiring novelist wanting to experience the world for his book. Regardless, Sonny places all of his attention on Guy at the expense of everyone else, especially the other temporary resident of the hotel, Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig), a young Brit who is on a reconnaissance trip at the hotel for her mother, and at the expense of his and Sunaina's wedding planning. Sonny's world takes a possible turn for the worse with the arrival back into town of his brother's friend, Kushal (Shazad Latif), as Kushal ends up factoring into Sonny's professional life, as well as is a person who may interest neglected Sunaina romantically. What Sonny is unaware of is that his own actions are a bigger threat to his professional success and future life with Sunaina than Kushal or anybody or anything else. He will also find that eventual heartache is an inherent part of his life in running the hotel in its current model.—Huggo As the contented residents of the hotel begin settling into their new lives, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) strives to balance the demands of planning his wedding with the responsibilities of purchasing a new property. Meanwhile, new guests Guy Chambers (Richard Gere) and Lavinia Beech (Tamsin Greig) find themselves in a predicament after arriving at the hotel to find there is only one vacancy. Perhaps with a little innovation new co-manager Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith) can find a means of accommodating the hotel's latest occupants, but she'll have her work cut out for her as Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) and Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) begin their new careers in Jaipur while flirting with the idea of a serious romance, like Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) and Carol Parr (Diana Hardcastle). With romance in the air, it's no wonder that Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) has her pick of handsome suitors, and as stalwart Muriel safeguards the many secrets of the vivacious residents, Sonny and Sunaina learn that planning a traditional Indian wedding can be a true test of commitment.

Entourage,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1674771/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Movie star Vincent Chase, together with his boys Eric, Turtle, and Johnny, are back - and back in business with super agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold on a risky project that will serve as Vince's directorial debut. This movie picks up where the TV show ended. Vincent Chase is offered a role by his former agent now Studio boss Ari Gold in a movie he is developing. Vincent agrees on the condition that he be allowed to direct the movie also. Nearly a year later, Vince is uncertain if the movie is ready, so he asks Ari for money to finish the movie. But Vincent has asked for money more than once already and Ari's bosses are not happy of how much they're spending. But he goes to their backer to ask for more money and he wants to see what Vince has shot so far but Vince won't let anyone see it yet. But he's planning a screening, and asks the backer to come to L.A. with him but he can't so he sends his son instead. At the screening Vince decides not to show it. But gives out DVDS. The son after watching the movie, says he has issues with Drama, Vince's brother who has a small role in the movie. Vince is unwilling to drop him. When they appease the son, he then says he has issues with Vince. So as they try to fix the situation, Ari's catching heat both professionally and personally. And Vincent's friend, E who is expecting a baby with his ex Sloane, is trying to decide if he wants to get back with her.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Vincent Chase, who separated from his wife after nine days of marriage, wants to do something new in his career. He calls his former agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold, who offers Vince a leading role in his first studio production. Vince says he will only star in it if he directs. Eight months later, Hyde, the directorial debut by Vince, is in the middle of post-production and is over budget by $15 million. Needing more money, Vince asks Ari if they can get an additional $10 million to complete the movie. Reluctant, but wanting to please him, Ari flies to Texas to meet the co-financiers of the movie, Larsen McCredle and his son Travis, to get them to give the money. Hesitant, Larsen sends Travis with Ari back to Los Angeles to see a cut of the film at Vince's private screening. Vince has second thoughts on the rough cut and cancels the screening out of fear no one will enjoy it. He later gives Ari and Travis a copy of the movie for their viewing. Ari and Travis enjoy the movie but Travis requests that Ari cut the scenes with Vince's brother, Johnny ""Drama"" Chase, out of the movie or he will not give the film the extra money. With Ari giving him no answer, Travis puts the post-production on hold. Vince and Eric ""E"" Murphy visit Travis to come up with a solution, but this results in Travis saying he did not like Vince's performance either and wants the entire movie to be redone with a new lead and director. In addition, studio CEO John Ellis removes Ari from the production.. The film starts with Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon), Eric ""E"" Murphy (Kevin Connolly), and Sal ""Turtle"" Assante (Jerry Ferrara) riding a motorboat to a yacht party for their buddy Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier). Vince has just been separated from his wife after nine days of marriage and is already dating Nina Agdal. The guys talk about a new project for Vince. He calls up his former agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven). Ari offers Vince the project, but Vince says that he wants to direct the film too. Ari is left silent.After an opening credits sequence (not unlike that of the TV series), we see a segment from Piers Morgan eight months later, detailing Vince's directorial debut, ""Hyde"", which is a new take on ""Jekyll and Hyde"". Vince has cast Drama in a pivotal supporting role. The segment also adds that E is still managing Vince while Turtle is still his driver. Ari is obviously nervous about having allowed Vince, a big Hollywood actor, to go ahead and take on such a big project for his first-time directing gig. Drama, meanwhile, is confident that he will nab himself an Oscar nomination.The film's production goes over-budget by $15 million. The guys head to the studio to meet with Ari so Vince can ask him for more in addition to the $100 million Ari already gave Vince. Ari doesn't want to do it because he'll have to involve financiers from Texas, but Vince is certain that he needs it to fully complete his vision.As the guys leave the studio, Turtle catches a glimpse of Ronda Rousey. He gets excited and follows her, hoping she will remember him from the one time they met. She stops her car in the middle of the street and grabs a wrench to hit Turtle's car until she recognizes him and Vince, noting that Turtle used to be fat.E meets up at the OB/GYN with his ex-girlfriend Sloan (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who is close to giving birth. He meets T.I. in the waiting room, who is pissed that he's about to have another baby. E is also currently seeing a new girl named Melanie (Sabina Gadecki), though he hasn't told Sloan about her. She finds out when she sees a text from her that says she wants E's cock.Ari is in Texas to meet with the financiers. He chats on FaceTime with his former assistant Lloyd (Rex Lee). Lloyd is getting married and wants Ari to give him away because he has a sour relationship with his dad. Ari groans and hangs up as he pulls up to the home of the financiers, Larsen McCredle (Billy Bob Thornton) and his doofus son Travis (Haley Joel Osment). The two are hesitant in giving Ari more money, but Ari is confident in Vince's work and persuades Larsen to give up the money. He sends Travis back with Ari to ensure things go well.After the movie's rough cut is complete, Vince hosts a screening party, with celebrity guests like Gary Busey, Clay Matthews, Andrew Dice Clay, and Bob Saget, who asks Vince to have sex with his daughter's friends so he won't have to. Drama chats with Jon Favreau for a part in another ""Iron Man"" movie, which Favreau declines. Ronda also shows up to hang out with Turtle. They walk in on E, hopped up on molly water, having sex with a girl he just met named Paula (Christine Donlon). Ari is upset that he's the only one that didn't get an invite, so he heads to the party himself to view the film anyway. Travis tags along and gets excited when he sees Vince with Emily Ratajkowski, as he has a huge crush on her. He introduces himself to her and comes off like a fool. A nervous Vince backs out and tells everyone that the projector broke, so he saves face by introducing the guests to Pharrell and gets him to perform. He gives Ari a DVD of the film for his own personal viewing.Ari watches the film at home. We see a bumping party in a tunnel where Vince, as the main character, plays the DJ. The cops show up to bust the party, until Vince throws everyone at the party a container of some sort. One person hurls a Molotov cocktail at the cops. Vince takes the serum and morphs into the film's Hyde persona. It then cuts to the next day where Ari has left Vince and the guys with a sweet new ride to show that he absolutely loved the movie, and he even gets E a mini-scooter as a gag. Ari drives to the studio to find Travis parked his car in Ari's spot. Ari leaves his car in front of Ed O'Neill's car, to the actor's dismay. Ari confronts Travis, who tells him that while he liked the movie, he did not like Drama's performance, and he demands that Vince cut Drama from the film.Turtle continues his pursuit of Ronda, but Drama thinks she is only talking to him to expand her brand. He meets with her and starts talking business, only to discover that Ronda actually is interested in him and cooked a meal for them, but she is upset at his behavior and orders him to leave.E joins Sloan at a Lamaze class and admits he still has some interest in her. She invites him to join her for sex until he admits he had sex with two women in the same day. Sloan leaves and E gets a call from Melanie, who says she is pregnant. She tells him to meet her at a restaurant. He walks there until Turtle and Drama spot him and take him there. Paula finds him and sits with him, suggesting she may have given him an STD. Melanie arrives and sits to argue with Paula, until it turns out they know each other and orchestrated the whole thing to see if E was a typical L.A. douchebag. Knowing that Melanie isn't pregnant and that Paula doesn't have a disease, E leaves in high spirits.Ari joins his wife (Perrey Reeves) at an anger management session with Dr. Marcus (Nora Dunn). The couple sees Kelsey Grammer leaving, swearing profusely. Ari has tried to keep his anger under control, but all the pressure from the movie is getting to him. He takes a phone call in the middle of the session to learn that Travis has locked himself in the studio and has kept everyone else out. Ari furiously punches a framed picture of a cat and continues with the meeting.Vince goes to the studio to try and get Travis to come out. He is approached by Mark Wahlberg and his own entourage as Ari shows up to tell Vince that Travis wants to cut Drama out of the picture. Mark says it's messed up and he wouldn't cut any of his family out of his stuff. Vince realizes he has to break the news to Drama himself.Drama is engaging in an affair with a woman he hooked up with at the screening party. They're about to get kinky on their phone cameras until the girl's boyfriend comes in and threatens Drama.Ari's assistant (Scott Mescudi) finds Ari during a meeting and tells him that the studio CEO John Ellis (Alan Dale) wants Ari to see him in his office. He retorts that Ellis should see him in his own office, forcing Ari to head to his office through the studio. He passes David Spade, who is upset that they're releasing ""Hyde"" on a date where one of his movies is coming out, along with Jessica Alba, who wants Ari to greenlight her passion project and also expresses her disgust at the director of her current project that is taking pictures of her ass. Ari gets to his office before Ellis does and plays hardball regarding the movie. However, Ellis still takes him off the project and replaces him.Vince finds his friends and tells them about their problem. Without saying a word, Drama realizes that HE is the problem. This sends him into a depression. He's drinking in the car on the way to a meeting with Travis. Vince and E speak with Travis, who admits he hated Vince in the movie. This throws everybody for a loop. Ari realizes something is up. He goes to meet with Travis, and realizes it's something personal, but he doesn't know what. Over lunch later, Vince confesses to the guys he's dating Emily Ratajkowski, and the guys realize that's why Travis is pissed.Drama goes to another audition, only for the casting directors to not pay attention to him because they see a viral video of Drama masturbating furiously, which the girl's boyfriend uploaded in retaliation. Drama is unable to escape the mockery wherever he goes.The guys join Turtle as he goes to the gym to apologize to Ronda for how he acted. She challenges him to a cage match to prove he really wants to go out with her. Turtle asks if 30 seconds will get him a date with her, to which Ronda says she'll have sex with him if he lasts a full minute. Ronda knocks Turtle on his ass and snaps his arm, right as the clock ticks 30 seconds.Ari flies to meet with Larsen, Ellis, Travis, and his old friend Dana Gordon (Constance Zimmer). He confronts the McCredles and says that the only reason Travis is slamming the movie is because he hates Vince, and it's because he's jealous of the time he spends with Emily. Apparently, Travis stayed outside her house one night to see if Vince would show up. Larsen is disappointed in his son and orders Travis to stay outside for the meeting. Ari gives Larsen a DVD of the movie, with Dana adding that she thinks it's amazing. Larsen says he trusts the studio because they do good work, but he won't give them anymore money unless Ari is fired. He says it's because he treated Travis poorly. He tells Ari that even if his son is a buffoon, he still wishes people would at least pretend to respect him. This seems to resonate with Ari, who realizes he screwed up.Sloan's waters break, and the guys go to the hospital for the birth of E's child. E tells Sloan that he still loves her. She gives birth to a healthy baby girl that they name Ryan Murphy (yes, after THAT Ryan Murphy). Drama forgets about his woes once he learns that E's daughter was born. He joins the gang at the hospital to celebrate. While there, Vince gets a phone call from Piers Morgan asking for a comment about the recent resignation of Ari as studio head. Ari arrives at the hospital room at the same time.On their way out of the hospital, Ari explains his resignation as a way to save dignity, as they were going to fire him anyways. He explains that he turned down a hefty severance package in exchange for a share of the profits from Vince's movie. He believes in the movie, and is proud of Vince and his entourage. We move to months later at the Golden Globe Awards, where we learn from Maria Menounos and Matt Lauer that ""Hyde"" is a worldwide box office success, and it's garnered 4 nominations, including Best Picture and two acting nominations for Vince and Drama.

Years later she crawls back into his window in the middle of the night to get him to help her to do 9 things of revenge against her cheating boyfriend. The next day it seems Margo has disappeared she left clues for him Quinten and his friends set off to find her before senior prom. After an adventure that Quentin takes with the young, beautiful Margo he simply falls in love overnight. After she goes missing Quentin and his friends search for clues to find her and he won't rest until he is reunited with his long lost love. Quentin's life changed the day Margo Roth Spiegelman moved next door. He considered her his one true love. They were both close in age, they became close friends and did everything together, until one day they discovered a dead body. Apparently, the man couldn't cope with his impending divorce. Quentin didn't flinch, but Margo took it badly. She showed up one day at his window, saying she discovered that the dead man's wife worked at Sea World, and wanted to go out with him to Sea World to solve the mystery. Quentin refused to go as it was 11:00 pm, and they were kids, so she rode her bike there without him. Quentin comments that Margo loved mysteries so much she became one. Her life was a series of epic adventures.We cut to them as teenagers. Margo (Cara Delevingne) was one of the popular kids at high school who did whatever she wanted, Quentin (Nat Wolff) is not, and they aren't really friends after that night in childhood. She went as a groupie for three months with a band among other things.One night, Margo crawls through Quentin's window and asks to borrow his car. Her parents keep their car keys in a safe under their bed every night, with a dog nearby who hates Margo (the dog will bark and wake them up). Since Quentin doesn't have a car, they use his mom's.They head to Costco and buy lots of plastic Saran Wrap, a raw catfish for cooking, Petroleum Jelly, spray paint, a steering wheel lock and Nair. Margo plans to exact revenge on all who have wronged her. Her boyfriend Jase (Griffin Freeman) is cheating with one of her best friends Becca (Caitlin Carver), so they first head to her house. Waiting outside, Margo sees Jase's car, and places the lock on his steering wheel as she knows he never locks the car. She then calls Becca's house and informs her dad that Becca is having sex in his basement. Her dad storms downstairs to discover the two of them in her room. Margo hands Quentin the camera before Jase runs out, and instructs Quentin to take a picture of Jase running naked across the lawn. Jase sees him but continues running. Quentin is scared, as Jase is on the football team and can beat him up, so Margo points out Jase's microscopic penis and says Jase won't beat him up if he threatens to release the photo. They both then run into Becca's room, while Becca is elsewhere, quarreling with her dad. Margo throws a fish in her closet and sprays an M on the wall.The next house they head to is Lacey's (Halston Sage), Margo's best friend. Margo is upset because Lacey knew Jase and Becca were cheating but said nothing. Margo saran-wraps her car, and sprays an M on it.The next house they head to is a guy who told all the girls in 6th grade not to dance with Quentin; this one is for him. She tells him to spray Nair on one of his eyebrows while she locks the door and puts Petroleum Jelly on the handle. As Quentin wipes off the nair and his eyebrow, the guy wakes up. They run out of his house, pulling the door behind them and he is unable to open it as the Jelly on the door makes it hard to unlock.The next place they head to is a business building. Quentin is hesitant to enter as he doesn't want to be caught trespassing because he has his whole life ahead of him; Duke University, med school, kids at age 30 and he looks forward to being happy. She is confused that he will wait until he's 30 until he's happy. She also lets him know that the guards name is Gus. They walk in, and Gus lets them in saying, ""Mi casa is su casa"". He and Margo appear to know each other well (the night guard appears to be very young.) They go to a conference room over-looking the city. She point at all the buildings and calls it a paper town with paper people, complaining that no one seems to care about the right things. Quentin is quite smitten with her, and they dance to some music before heading back home. After parking the car, Quentin asks Margo if tomorrow things will change between then. She appears to think they will, but the next day she is absent from school.A few days later, a police officer, Margo's parents and his parents all greet him in the dining room asking when was the last time he saw Margo. He tells them Wednesday night, but leaves out specifics, just saying that she climbed through his window to say hi. Margo's parents decline to file a missing persons report because she has run away five times before, and is now 18, free to do whatever she wants. Quentin also comments that every time she leaves, she leaves clues for her loved ones to come find her (mainly her sister.)Quentin is deeply in love with Margo, and longs to solve the mystery. His two friends, Ben and Radar (Austin Abrams and Justice Smith) help him mourn. One day, he notices her shades are down, showing a band on the blinds, which is weird, as all these years her blinds have never been down. The three guys go to Margo's house (her parents aren't home) and bribe her sister with $20 to let them look around. Her room is filled with records. He searches the records for the band on her blinds. He finds the record he is looking for and sees and writing circled Walt Whitman's niece. Then he sees the Walt Whitman book on her desk and takes it home.He spends the next few days reading the book and comes across a line circled- Unscrew the door themselves from their jams. He proceeds to Margo's house and again bribes her sister with $20 and uses a screwdriver to unhinge her doors to find nothing.Later that night, still reading Walt Whitman's book, he notices a small piece of paper in his door hinge with an address written on it. He calls Radar to join him, but Radar tells him no, they can go the next day as he has plans with Angela, his girlfriend.The next day, all three guys head to a shady part of town, going to the address, to find an abandoned building. Quentin hopes Margo is inside. They enter to see a hole in the wall leading to an abandoned store: still no Margo.The next day in school, Jase approaches Quentin with his friends and tries to beat him up, but he shows him the picture and threatens to release it, and Jase and his friends leave him alone. Lacey approaches Quentin and friends, to find out what happened to Margo, as he was with her on her last night in town. He tells Lacey they're trying to find out, but also lets her know Margo is angry that she didn't let her know about Jase and Becca's affair. Lacey claims she had no idea, but that her boyfriend knew, she really seems concerned for Margo and broke up with her boyfriend when she found out. She also lets him know that now she is without prom date and Ben immediately begins flirting with her, she says she'll be at Jase's party later. The boys seem excited and decide to attend a popular party, now that they have dirt on Jase. Quentin is obsessed with Margo's disappearance and decides not to attend.He goes back to the abandoned room and sees Margo has written on the wall ""We live in Paper Towns"". Confused, he falls asleep and sees Margo approaching him in a red dress begging him to come find her. Quentin is awoken when Radar calls at the party and lets him know that Ben is drunk, and that they need help to get him home. He arrives, hoping to search Jase's room for clues, but Becca and Jase are banging upstairs. He then heads to the bathroom, and mid pee is interrupted by Lacey, who is hiding in the tub. He joins her (platonically) in the tub, and they discuss life. He lets her know that he and his friends are searching for Margo. Lacey says everyone thinks she's just a pretty face, but she is actually going to Dartmouth in the fall. When Jase interrupts, Quentin knows he can now go search his room. He finds an atlas like one in the abandoned store with a page missing.After one friend pukes in the house, they head to the abandoned building. They look through the other atlases and are startled to find that Lacey has followed them, she wants to know what happened to Margo. He finds the missing page and holds it against the light, to see that Margo has made holes in the map, pointing to where she is headed. He hangs up the map and discovers she is headed to New York, and the one friend says that there are so many towns there that they'll never find her. Quentin then instructs him to look for a Paper Town, made up towns on maps that people place to see if anyone infringes their copyright by copying their map without permission. They find one Agloe, New York.MRS (Margo's initials) edits the Wikipedia page and gives it a population of 1. The four agree to leave immediately in order to make it back to prom, but Radar wants to stop to tell his girlfriend Angela goodbye, and she joins them. The five head on a road trip to New York, and one friend, who needs to pee half hour in, is given bottles to pee in and spills it in the car. So they make a six minute stop to buy food, drinks, new clothes and plan out their trip stops in order to make it home in time for prom.At night, Quentin nearly hits a cow, but Ben spins the wheel and averts is, so they skid and decide to stop for the night. Angela has sex with her boyfriend. Ben and Lacey agree to go to prom together.They arrive in Agloe, New York the next day and find the barn, but it's empty. The rest give up and decide to head back for prom, but Quentin doesn't want to go and is angry they don't want to find her. Lacey loves Margo but says Margo would never do the same for her, Ben and Radar just did it to have one last memory and a fun road trip before they graduate. He gives them the keys and tells them hell find another way home.Quentin hitch hikes to town and buys a bus ticket home, but sees Margo walk by. He runs after her and calls her name. She is surprised to see him there; she left clues for him to find to let him know she is okay, not to join her. He says he loves her, and she is surprised, saying everyone likes the idea of her, but no one really likes her. She buys him a drink and explains she wasn't made for town life, and this is the perfect place to lose, and then find herself, in solitude. She planned to disappear after graduation, but Jase, and Becca's cheating speeded it up. She relents, offering to let him join her, but he decides against it. He wants to go to Duke. They hug, and he tells her that her sister misses her. She says they talk everyday on the phone.Quentin heads back in time to join all of his friends at prom, and the five of them dance and enjoy themselves.The film ends with him saying that someone says they saw Margo doing a play on Broadway, another claiming to see her giving surf lessons in Malibu."
Chappie,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson. The former military Vincent Moore is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Johannesburg, South Africa. In order to curb the high crime rate the police use robots to fight crime. This is an immediate success and the police order several more robots from the developer, Tetravaal. After falling foul of these robots, two criminals, Ninja and Yolandi, kidnap Tetravaal's chief engineer, and genius behind the robots, Deon Wilson, with the aim of getting him to deactivate them. To their surprise he is transporting one of the robots, Scout 22, as he is working on a personal project to give robots consciousness. Ninja and Yolandi see the opportunity to have a robot on their side and immediately set about attempting to train the robot to help them in their criminal activities. They also give him a name - Chappie.—grantss A law enforcing robot (agent 22) is severely damaged during an encounter between two rival criminal gangs. His creator recommends that this police droid be dismantled & recycled. However, this Bot is infused with new life and emotions after a group of criminals abduct the creator and force him to modify the machine. Now possessing emotions, a name and the ability to choose between right & wrong what path will Chappie choose to tread on?—Ashvin Moorooteea In a crime-ridden near-future Johannesburg, the robotic squad of mechanised law enforcers known as the Scouts--state-of-the-art creations of the benign engineer, Deon Wilson--have managed to clean up the streets, minimising police officer casualties. However, when the criminal trio, Yo-Landi, Amerika, and Ninja, abduct Deon in high hopes of turning the powerful droids off, they end up with Scout #22: a mangled robot marked for destruction. Now, after a few repairs and a new AI software, a metal killer with the mind of an infant is theirs to do their bidding, provided mama Yo-Landi and papa Ninja show Chappie the ropes, and teach him a thing or two about the gangsta etiquette. Is Chappie capable of choosing his future?—Nick Riganas Set in an undeterminate year of the near future in South Africa, Johannesburg is the first city to use a robot police force. Tetravaal is the company that develops and supplies the robots to the city. The deployed robots are called Scouts. Created by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) these robots are completely automated and have artificial intelligence. Deon's office rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has created The Moose (basically ED-209 from Robocop), which is operated remotely by a human. Moore isn't a big fan of Deon's work.Scout unit 22 is back in the shop again. It seems this particular unit is accident prone and is always getting serviced. The techs get it back into action and send it out into the field where it assists in a police raid on a drug deal gone bad.On one side of the drug deal are Ninja and Yolandi, members of the real world South African band Die Antwoord. They're playing characters named Ninja and Yolandi (same as their own real names). They're teamed with Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo). They're trying to deliver goods to crime boss Hippo (Brandon Auret). Hippo demands that Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika pay him $20 million within 7 days. During the meeting, the police and Scouts raid. Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika manage to escape during the police raid. Hippo shoots a rocket launcher into Scout 22's chest, seriously damaging it. Hippo also manages to evade the cops. After the raid, Yolandi has an idea that the scouts are probably like a television, so they must be able to be turned off by a remote control. If they can find out how to do that they won't have to worry about these effective weapons.Moore asks Tetravaal's boss Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) for more money to assist with further developing his Moose. Deon's robocops are such a hit that the government has decided to sink more money into that project, and ordered 100 more of them, and has no interest in the Moose.Back at the shop at Tetravaal's headquarters, the technicians see that Scout 22's battery is fused with his chest piece, so he's beyond repair. They set him aside to be scrapped.Hippo calls the gang and tells them that he's not dead or in jail, and he still expects them to pay him the $20 million they owe him. Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika believe they need to conduct another heist to get the money for Hippo.Deon goes home, which has several artificial intelligence robot pets, and starts working on his newest project, which is creating an artificial consciousness for the Scout units. After a long night of programming and Red Bull, he succeeds.Ninja's gang sees a TV news story and learns Deon is the mastermind engineer behind the Scouts, so he must be the guy who knows how to power them off.Deon asks Bradley if he can use his artificial consciousness program on the scrapped 22 unit. He explains that it's possible that this could create a robot smarter than humans and it could even conceivably write music and poetry. She explains that they're in the business of defense and not in the business of creating poets, so she denies his request citing insurance, red tape, and paperwork.Deon decides to take a chance, gets the scrapped 22 and the Guard Key, which is needed to update the programming in all the robots as a precaution against hackers, and smuggles them out of the factory. Ninja's gang kidnaps him before he can get home.Moore, in a meeting with Ms. Bradley and a committee, tries to convince them that the moose is a better weapon than the Scouts, but they turn him down saying that the moose is big, expensive and ugly.The gang (Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika) takes the kidnapped Deon back to their base/hideout and ask him how to shut down the Scouts. He says it's impossible. They're about to kill him, but discover the Scout 22 unit in the back of his van. They put a gun to his head and force him to agree to program it to work for them. He assembles it for them, explaining that if his program works, it can be taught. He installs the new software into the unit and Scout 22 ""awakens"" and has the personality of a scared child. Yolandi takes on an immediate mother-role and tells him that he's a happy chappie and names him Chappie. They let Deon leave, but he asks to come back to check on the progress. He also tells them that because of the fused battery, Chappie has only about five days to live.Moore wants to work on his Moose, but discovers that the Guard Key is missing. His computer tells him that the guard key is installed in Scout 22 and he knows that Deon must have taken it.The next day Yolandi and Amerika start teaching Chappie how to talk. Ninja gets mad that because he needs Chappie trained to help them to do one more heist so they can pay back Hippo. Ninja starts to train Chappie to shoot guns but gets very frustrated because Chappie is a slow learner.At work, Moore puts his gun to Deon's head and tells him to return the guard key. Deon refuses and Moore pulls the trigger but it merely clicks and Moose pretends it as a joke.Back at the hideout, the gang teaches Chappie some more words, including tough gangster talk and profanity.Deon leaves work to check on Chappie. He's mad that the gang is turning him into a foul mouthed thug, so he asks Chappie to promise not to count drugs, commit crimes, or do anything illegal. Moore follows Deon to the hideout in hopes of finding out where Deon is keeping the guard key. Ninja returns and threatens to kill Deon again for interfering with his plans. Yolandi say to let Chappie be a kid but Ninja says that he needs Chappie to be ready within 5 days to pull the heist to repay Hippo (or else Chappie will ""die""). Moore leaves without interacting with any of these tough characters.Ninja and Amerika take Chappie to the middle of a rough area and leave him there as a test to see if he can toughen up and defend himself. The locals start attacking him with rocks, pipes, and flammable chemicals, but because Chappie promised Deon he wouldn't do anything bad, he doesn't fight back. He manages to run away and escape.In a van, Moore tracks the escaping Chappie and locates him. Moore deactivates Chappie with a battering-ram-looking electronic device. They take him into the van and cut off his arm and remove the guard key. They were going to chop him up into more pieces but Chappie fights back and manages to open the doors and escape out the back of the moving van. Moore says they can let him go now because he is crippled because he's missing the guard key and can't learn anymore.Chappie makes his way back to the gang hideout. Yolandi is angry that Amerika and Ninja endangered Chappie. Amerika and Yolandi fix him back up by attaching a new, spare robot arm. Yolandi reads Chappie bedtime stories and tells him that he has a soul inside and ""that's what Mommy loves."" Ninja and Amerika figure out a way to trick Chappie into helping them. Together, they steal cars so they can get money to get weapons so they can do their big heist.Once they have enough money, they go to a crazy looking tall, round apartment building, not completely unlike the building in Dredd. When they get there, a dog fight is taking place. The criminals there see the Scout (Chappie) and scurry away, thinking he is a police scout on a raid. Chappie and Ninja go up to see the arms dealer Pitbull (Johnny Selema) and buy explosives, weapons, and Sony Playstation 4's. When they return, Chappie is trying to nurse a dead dog back to health. Ninja explains to him that in life you can either end up as the dead dog, or as the winning dog. He must fight if he's to be like the dog that survives. He also tells him that his battery can't be fixed because Deon made him to die. But if he helps them with their heist, they'll be able to buy him a new body. Chappie goes along with the idea because he doesn't want to die.Deon returns to the gang hideout and is disappointed that Chappie is out doing illegal stuff with Ninja and Amerika. Yolandi tells him that he should leave because Ninja will kill him if he finds him there. Chappie, Ninja and Amerika return. While the two are alone, Deon tries to reason with Chappie, but Chappie tells him that he's angry that Deon didn't tell him that he was going to die in a few days. Chappie tells Deon that he wants to live and stay with ""Mommy"" (Yolandi) and not die.Back at Tetravaal headquarters, Moore, plugs the guard key in and installs new firmware, genesis.dat, that remotely disables all scouts around the country. They fall to the ground wherever they are. The criminals realize this and pummel any Scouts they see. Thousands of crimes all over Johannesburg are now being committed since the Scouts have been shut down. Total chaos and viciousness rule the city.Deon loads the deactivated Chappie back into the van and returns to Tetravaal headquarters. Deon finds the Guard Key in Moore's computer and reverses the genesis firmware update that Moore remotely installed into all Scouts, and brings Chappie back to life. However Chappie knows he is still going to die in a few days and says he wants to be transferred into a new robot body that is hanging there. Before they escape, Chappie sees The Moose robot. Deon explains that The Moose is controlled by transferring a human operators consciousness into The Moose via a control helmet. Chappie steals the helmet and they go back to the gang hideout.The gang has Chappie help them rob an armored car, and it is covered live on the news. Hippo and his gang are watching. In the escape from the armored car heist, Chappie asks about his new body, now that they have money, and Ninja lets on that it was all lies, that he needed Chappie just for the heist, and that there would be no new body for Chappie, who would still die in a few days. Chappie is furious. At the gang hideout, Deon says that a threat is coming (meaning Hippo) and Chappie must be prepared to fight. He shows Chappie a gun but Chappie refuses to use it. Chappie rigs up Yolandi's laptop and all the PS4s to create a super computer. He tests the helmet out on Yolandi and it works!Moore tries to convince Ms. Bradley that since all the Scouts have broken down that they are defective and that she should enable him to proceed with the Moose program instead of the unreliable Scouts. Moore also convinces Bradley that Deon is the cause of the Scout robots committing crimes. Bradley gives Moore authorization to use The Moose to combat the crime and track down Deon.Hippo's gang shows up at Ninja's gang's hideout. He now wants Chappie for himself after seeing it on TV during the armored car heist. Back at Tetravaal headquarters, Moore remotely pilots a flying Moose to Ninja's hideout to obliterate them all. A three way fire fight breaks out. The Moose steps on Amerika and rips him in half and flings him against a building. Moose starts indiscriminately shooting at everyone. Moose fires cluster bombs at Hippo's gang and kills them all except Hippo himself. Chappie attacks Moose. He is no match for Moose's awesome firepower but is able to jump on the Moose and attach a bomb. Hippo shoots Ninja and Deon but then Hippo is killed by Ninja with a shovel. Ninja taunts Moose so that Deon, Yolandi and Chappie can escape in the van back into their hideout building. The Moose is about to take out Ninja, but Yolandi surprises it by launching a rocket at it. The rocket is ineffective and Moose turns and shoots Yolandi dead. Chappie jumps back into the action and blows up The Moose with the explosive he had attached to the Moose when he had jumped onto it earlier before the Moose (Moore) has a chance to kill Ninja. They bury Yolandi in a shallow grave. Chappie says he's needs to go back to Tetravaal to kill a man (meaning Moore, whose Moose robot shot Yolandi/Mommy dead).Chappie drives Deon in the van back to the Tetravaal headquarters/lab. Moore is still there. Chappie beats him into a mangled mess, but doesn't kill him. Deon is seconds away from death, but Chappie puts Deon's consciousness into the one orange test robot that's available. As Transvaal secutiry forces try to get into the room they're in, Deon, now a robot, figures out a way to save Chappie too. He sends Chappies consciousness into the nearest fallen Robocop, out on a street nearby the Tetravaal HQ, from Moore's computer, which still has the guard key inserted into it.So Deon and Chappie are both robots now. Chappie saved Yolandi's consciousness saved on a USB flash drive from earlier when he was testing out the helmet. Chappie hacks into the Tetravaal robot factory and has it create a new schematic, for a female scout. Presumably much later, after Tetravaal has built and tested the new female Scout, Yolandi's consciousness is transferred into a brand new Fembot.And Deon, Chappie, and Yolandi all lived happily ever after....... as Scout robots."

Wrapping her dark, decaying fingers around young Edith's shoulder as the girl shudders in her bed trying to will away her terror, the ghost whispers a warning: ""Beware of Crimson Peak.""14 years later in 1901, when Edith is a young woman living in Buffalo, New York she aspires to write about the ghosts she sees and encounters, though it is implied that her mother's is the clearest and most intimate encounter she has ever had. Instead, she is pressured into writing about romance as it is expected of her gender. Edith writes the story and it fails, though it passes the eye of a visiting aristocrat seeking funding for an invention of his own from Edith's father. The aristocrat is Sir Thomas Sharpe of Allerdale Hall, which is located atop a mine for red clay ultisol that is used in brick-making and rendering for iron ore. Being wary of aristocracy, the New York gentleman, Carter, turns away the Cumbria-born Sharpe with extreme distaste. Thomas turns his attentions to Edith and gains her affection by crediting her as a gifted writer and story-teller who doesn't merely write 'ghost stories', but rather writes stories that happen to have ghosts. Charmed by this notion, Edith begins a romance with Sir Thomas that is watched closely by her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam).Mysteriously, Cushing is brutally killed in the mens room, his skull crushed in by a shadowy figure. In the wake of his untimely death, Edith seeks solace in her romance with Sir Thomas who gently and tenderly seduces her into leaving New York for his own home in England to escape the ghosts of her past. Remembering the horror of being visited by her mother, Edith immediately agrees and sets sail for England. McMichael is wary of this arrangement and makes his own way to England later. Once at Allerdale Hall, a brilliantly clad but dilapidated mansion teetering on the red mire beneath it and crumbling under the snow and rain above, is revealed to be the Sharpe family home. Its unofficial name is Crimson Peak due to the red clay beneath it, though this is not mentioned to Edith at first, so the warning is not heeded. There, Lady Lucille Sharpe, Thomas' older sister who has already seemed cold and distant towards Edith despite her charming brother's demeanor and her apparent warmth for her brother, becomes even more cruel and controlling of Edith even denying her a copy of the keys to the rooms of the house itself. Edith is once again visited by the spirit of her mother who again wraps her fingers around Edith's shoulder and offers the same warning: ""Beware of Crimson Peak.""Edith becomes inconsolable after visits by other ghosts begin to terrify her, but Lucille firmly insists that she stays. As Edith's inquiries about the house's and the family's histories begin to become more vocal, ghosts begin to appear all the more, beckoning her to the mines below.
Edith explores the mansion and pieces clues together, discovering that Thomas previously married three wealthy women.Despite a warning from her husband, who is awaiting the fortune of the late Carter Cushing, who is revealed to have been killed by Lucille, Edith ventures into the attic where the two siblings were holed up by their abusive mother and to the rendering vats below in the mines where she uncovers the decaying corpse of Sir Thomas's last victim.One of the ghosts lures Edith to a linen closet where she discovers wax cylinders on which one of Thomas' previous wives recorded a message telling that the Sharpes are poisoning her for her inheritance. Thomas and Lucille have been using the inheritance of brides whose families lost their patriarch to fund Thomas's inventive efforts. It is revealed that the siblings conspired both to murder the holder of the fortune if necessary and then the woman herself. It is also revealed that Thomas has an incestuous relationship with his sister who seduced him at a young age and that Lucille also conspired to free them and 'never be apart' by killing their own mother who had discovered the siblings' sexual relationship. Left with the house to tend to, the two clung to their cursed surroundings and began the plots of marriage and slaying out of necessity. Sir Thomas has truly fallen in love with Edith, however, and cannot this time bring himself to do the deed. Insane with jealousy and greed, Lucille loses her calm demeanor and becomes a feral killer.McMichael arrives to take Edith back to New York only to be stabbed and wounded terribly by a knife-wielding Lucille. Realizing that his wife is in mortal danger, Thomas helps Edith escape the house and is killed by Lucille in the process, dying the better man he had always wished to be. Edith becomes enraged that the man she loved was so corrupted by Lucille and herself strikes back with an equally large butcher knife. The two women battle one another intensely with Lucille doing considerable bloody damage, but ultimately being slain by Edith herself. Leaving the corpse of Lucille, Edith returns to the house and rescues McMichael.The two escape to a nearby city while the film reveals the images of the Sharpe siblings' ghosts now residing in the home. Lucille has become a ghost and continues to play the piano and seems to have her eyes filled with hate while the once charming Sir Thomas is steeped in sorrow and shame.The final shot implies that Edith has now written a best-selling book about her experiences which is appropriately titled 'Crimson Peak'."
A Walk in the Woods,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1178665/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After spending two decades in England, Bill Bryson (Robert Redford) returns to the U.S., where he decides the best way to connect with his homeland is to hike the Appalachian Trail with one of his oldest friends, Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte). In this new comedy adventure, celebrated travel writer, Bill Bryson (Robert Redford), instead of retiring to enjoy his loving and beautiful wife, Catherine (Dame Emma Thompson), and large and happy family, challenges himself to hike the Appalachian Trail - two thousand two hundred miles of America's most unspoiled, spectacular and rugged countryside from Georgia to Maine. The peace and tranquility he hopes to find, though, is anything but, once he agrees to being accompanied by the only person he can find willing to join him on the trek - his long-lost and former friend Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), a down-on-his-luck serial philanderer who, after a lifetime of relying on his charm and wits to keep one step ahead of the law - sees the trip as a way to sneak out of paying some debts and sneak into one last adventure before its too late. The trouble is, the two have a completely different definition of the word, ""adventure"". Now they're about to find out that when you push yourself to the edge, the real fun begins.—Broad Green Pictures Author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford) is living the quiet life in New Hampshire with his wife Catherine (Dame Emma Thompson) and family. He decides to hike the two thousand two hundred mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Catherine insists he not go alone, so Bryson searches far and wide for someone to accompany him. Though not approached, old friend Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte) volunteers. However, Katz is unfit and seems like he may be a liability in Bryson's endeavors. Nevertheless, the two of them set off on an adventure of a lifetime.—grantss Lauded travel writer Bill Bryson (Robert Redford) returns to America after decades abroad with the intention of retiring. However, he's drawn in by the lure of the Appalachian Trail, of which he challenges himself to hike the entirety. He's joined on his journey by a long-lost friend, habitual criminal and line-stepper Katz (Nick Nolte), and the two embark on an unforgettable and challenging adventure. In the twilight of his life, New Hampshire based travel writerBill Bryson(Robert Redford), who has travelled the world primarily outside the U.S. for work, literally stumbles upon the idea to hike the two thousand two hundred mile Appalachian Trail, despite only a small fraction of those that make the attempt, the majority being much younger, complete the entire length, which usually takes in the realm of five or six months. Most that know him consider the idea total folly, including his adult children and his loyal and faithful wife of forty years, Catherine (Dame Emma Thompson), who tries to talk him out of it. If he is determined to do it, she insists that he not do it alone. In Bill putting the feelers out, the only person who responds positively is Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), who only heard about it through a mutual friend, as the two have not seen or talked to each other in forty years. They parted company way back then on less than good terms. In reuniting with Stephen, Bill can see that it will be a difficult physical journey since he's not in the best of shape. Beyond the physical issues and the natural hazards of the hike, they will have to overcome many other obstacles if they have any hope of completing the journey, including dealing with the misadventures they get into with other people they meet along the way. Arguably, the biggest obstacle may be dealing with each other, not only in having different motivations for making this trip, but in addressing the other's foibles which made them not keep in touch for forty years.—Huggo Bill Bryson (Robert Redford) is a successful author who after living in England for many years, comes back to live in New Hampshire, with his loving wife, Catherine (Emma Thompson) whom he met and married while living in England. After a TV interview, Bill goes with Catherine to a funeral. After talking to the widow and offering their condolences, Bill wants to leave, but Catherine tells him to go and talk with the others that are there.When they get home, Bill tells Catherine that he is going for a walk. On his walk, he comes across a sign that says ""The Appalachian Trail."" Later that night, Bill does some research on the trail, concluding that it is a 2,000+ mile trek from Georgia to Maine. When he tells Catherine about it, she voices her displeasure with the idea. But, she eventually relents when she tells Bill that she will let him go on the hike if he can find someone to go with him.After calling everyone he knows, he almost gives up since everyone that he called declines. Suddenly, he gets a phone call from his long-lost friend, Stephen (Nick Nolte) who offers to go with him on the hike. When Bill tells Catherine, she gets upset because she has heard stories about Stephen's philandering ways. Bill tells her that she agreed to let him go if he found someone, which he has. So she lets him go.Bill and his son go to an outdoor shop to buy supplies for the trip. The salesperson (Nick Offerman) entices Bill with some camping equipment, including an overpriced backpack and a tent.Bill and Catherine go to the airport to meet Stephen. Stephen, overweight and clearly out-of-shape, stumbles off the airplane. When he sees Bill, they hug, and he also hugs Catherine.That night, Stephen tells Bill's family stories about Bill with other women in his past. Bill, who was out of the room, comes in and is surprised that Stephen told them about that. Catherine asks Bill why he kept those stories a secret, to which he says that he forgot about it. Catherine tells Stephen that she wants to hear more of these stories.The next day, the two men head off to the start point of the trail. The first morning is clearly the most difficult. Bill starts off at a nice pace, but Stephen is very slow, so Bill has to adjust his pace. Other hikers pass them, including a boy scout group.They stop to get something to eat, which is when they are approached by Mary Ellen (Kristen Schaal), a loud, arrogant, know-it-all hiker who doesn't hike with others because she points out their techniques as being wrong and assumes that she is the only one who hikes ""the correct way"".She tags along with Bill and Stephen, constantly talking about them and even telling Bill that he got ripped off at the outdoor shop and that the salesperson must have seen him coming.That night, Bill goes over to Stephen's tent with a plan to ditch Mary Ellen. They agree to get up early and head out before she wakes up. In the morning, as they prepare to leave, Mary Ellen wakes up. She asks them if they are leaving, and they say they are. Bill asks if she wants them to wait for her. She says that she will catch up. When she goes back into her tent, Bill and Stephen take off down the trail. She begins to catch up to them, so they hide until she passes by, and then they continue.A little later, Bill and Stephen come across another hiker heading in the opposite direction. He tells them that a storm is coming and that they should prepare for it. Stephen looks up at the clouds and doesn't see any sign of an approaching storm.All of a sudden, they are hit by a snowstorm. They eventually make camp and are able to ride out the storm. They come to a motel with some cabins. When they ask for a cabin, the front desk attendant tells them that all that is left is a couple of bunks in the main room.They go and settle in their bunks. Stephen takes the top bunk while Bill takes the bottom. Bill lays down in his bunk and looks up and notices the boards cracking from Stephen's weight. Suddenly, Stephen crashes through and falls onto Bill.They continue on and eventually come to another town. They head to the local motel, where the proprietor, Jeannie (Mary Steenburgen) begins to develop feelings for Bill after they have a conversation. Bill decides not to do anything with Jeannie, due to him being married.The next morning, Bill and Stephen go to the local laundromat to do some laundry. Bill decides to go to K-Mart to get some supplies before they head out, but ends up falling into a mud pit after taking a shortcut to avoid crossing a busy highway to get to the store.Stephen develops an attraction to a woman who comes into the laundromat. They decide to meet at a fire station later that day. Bill comes back with his clothes all muddy and Stephen tells him the story of the woman at the laundromat.Stephen goes to meet the woman while Bill goes to have lunch at a restaurant. As he's having lunch, Stephen comes in and tells Bill that the woman is married and that her husband is looking for him (Stephen). So, they go back to the motel and prepare to get ready to get back on the trail. All of a sudden, they hear screeching tires. It is the woman's husband. He is knocking on all of the doors in the motel, trying to find Stephen. They are able to avoid the man by escaping out the window in the bathroom.They get back on the trail. On the path, they are chatting when they find themselves at the edge of a cliff, overlooking a beautiful landscape view. They choose to stop and end up having an enlightening conversation about Stephen's past as an alcoholic and his being sober for years. He shows Bill a bottle of bourbon that he has in his bag. He tells Bill that the bottle is a reminder that he can drink, but that he chooses not to. He has Bill open the bottle, which he does. Bill hands the bottle back to Stephen. Stephen smells the bourbon inside the bottle and then pours it out.Later that night, Bill hears some noises in the woods. He wakes Stephen up and asks him if he hears it. Stephen passes it off as being nothing. Bill shines a flashlight into the bushes and two grizzly bears come out and start smelling around. Stephen gets frightened, but Bill suggests that they have to stand up to the bears and then they will go away. With their tents, they are able to appear larger, make noises, and successfully frighten the two bears away.The next day, they continue on and pass a sign that says that this particular area is only for experienced hikers. They press on and end up accidentally falling down a part of a ravine onto a small section of a platform that overlooks the river below. They are trapped because they cannot climb back up the mountain and cannot climb down because of the river below. So after trying to make a makeshift rope with their clothes, they concede for the night.The next morning, they are noticed by two hikers that they encountered earlier in the trip, who rescue them. As they press on, they notice a map that highlights where they are in the trail. The map shows that they have only hiked about a third of the entire length of the trail, and they have already been hiking for months (they started in April, and it was already after June). It is not too long afterward that Bill asks Stephen if he wants to go home. Stephen says that he does.Bill accompanies Stephen to the bus station where they say their goodbyes. Bill heads home and hugs a grateful Catherine. Bill goes over to his study where Catherine has put all of his mail, including some postcards. The postcards are from Stephen, who wrote them on his bus trip home. The postcards comment on different key things during the trip, including the grizzly bear incident. On the final postcard, Stephen writes, ""Hey Bill. What's next?""Bill opens up his laptop and begins writing his new book, entitled ""A Walk In The Woods"".THE END"

In a farmhouse near a corn field where Ellison Oswait lived, the boy Dylan has nightmares and is visited by ghostly children led by the boy Milo. Dylan lives with his mother Courtney Collins, who has just left her abusive husband, and his brother Zach and is forced by the ghosts to go to the basement to watch home films in Super 8 of families being slaughtered.

With the help of an ex-deputy they will attempt to race against time to stop the evil forces of the sinister Bughuul..—john_regrut Sinister 2, instead of using super 8 film the way the first Sinister movie did, uses other found footage mediums such as vinyl records, a ham radio and 16mm film. The film begins with a 16mm home movie of three people tied to crosses in a rural cornfield. One of the crosses suddenly catches fire, killing the person tied down to it.Deputy So & So from the first Sinister film visits a Catholic confession booth, and it is revealed to the audience that he is no longer a deputy because of his involvement with the Oswalt case. He is now a private investigator, and he spends his free time burning down the houses which he thinks that Bughuul visited. Meanwhile Courtney, a mother of two twin boys (Dylan and Zach), is shopping at the supermarket when suddenly a pervert begins following her, hired by her abusive ex-husband to locate his family. The pervert almost catches her, but she escapes with her sons and he is stopped by a security guard. She drives out to a decaying farmhouse where she and her sons have been in hiding for some time. Dylan has been having nightmares, and to stop them, his not-so-imaginary friend Milo (one of Bughuul's victims), shows him a number of 16mm snuff reels depicting families being murdered in various ways. One film shows a family eaten by alligators (Fishing Trip), one shows a family frozen to death in the snow (Christmas Morning), one shows a family being electrocuted violently (Kitchen Remodeling) and one shows a family being disemboweled by rats in a church (Sunday School). Zach becomes increasingly violent, calling his mom and brother nasty names, beating up his brother cruelly and displaying behavior akin to his abusive dad.Deputy comes to the house to burn it down, assuming that it is empty, but he's stopped by Courtney who threatens him and tries to chase him away. When she realizes that it's all a big misunderstanding, she invites him in for coffee. He explains that ever since his best friend Ellison Oswalt, was murdered, that he's been investigating similar cold cases. Courtney allows him to investigate the nearby church, where the rat murder happened, and while investigating, Deputy witnesses a number of odd and frightening paranormal things. Clint shows up without warning, along with a team of cops, demanding that the boys come out to see him, but Deputy chases them away, with the threat of telling the media about Clint's abuse. It is also revealed that Deputy was nearly arrested for the Oswalt family's murder but that the charges were dropped. Courtney invites him for supper and sees how nice he is to her and the boys, so she lets him spend the night on the living room couch before driving back to his motel. He wakes up in the night and goes over some crime scene photos, and Courtney comes downstairs. They start drinking out on the porch and she tells him about Clint. Deputy tells her that her abused son reminds him of himself when he was a kid (implying that he was abused by his own father in the past). He also tells her about his motives for obsessing with the Oswalt murders. Courtney tells him that she wishes he was the boys' father, and when they go back inside, they kiss briefly.The next morning, Deputy drives away to visit Dr. Stromberg, who reveals that Professor Jonas (from the first Sinister film) has gone missing, and that he discovered a disturbing recording on a HAM radio of a child speaking in Norwegian and then killing their family. The words translate back to ""I can't hear Bughuul over your yelling, mom!"" in English. The deputy requests that the radio be destroyed and it's revealed that Bughuul travels through art (books, film, music, drawings).At the same time, Courtney and her sons are taken from the house by Clint, and Zach watches the last film, Dental Work (a man having all his teeth pulled without anesthesia). Deputy shows up to rescue them, but Clint beats him up and threatens to murder him, so he leaves, and Clint starts the abuse all over again. The next day, Dylan texts Deputy with the words ""Help us!"" Zach becomes possessed and starts filming his family with the 16mm camera, drugging them, tying them to crosses and then lighting one cross on fire, with Clint on it. Clint is killed and he twitches violently in the flames, but before Zach can finish off his family, Deputy knocks him down with his car and unties Courtney and Dylan. Zach picks up the camera and a scythe and starts chasing them all through the cornfield, partially cutting off Deputy's hand, but they all make it back to the farmhouse. Zach searches for his family but Deputy hides them both, and Milo and the other dead children begin destroying the house room by room. They crush Deputy behind a desk and hit him with golf clubs, but before Zach can finish off Courtney and Dylan, Deputy smashes the camera, exposing the film to the light and destroying it instantly. Zach screams ""NO!"" repeatedly and runs to the basement, only to be cornered by the dead kids, who all worriedly tell him that Bughuul will get rid of their souls now. They disappear and Bughuul touches Zach's shoulder, turning him into ashes and killing him.Deputy, Courtney and Dylan drive away, back to Deputy's motel, but when he goes inside, he finds the HAM radio sitting on the nightstand. The voices of dead kids start drifting from the speakers, chanting ""It's the kids! It's the kids! It's the kids! ...DEPUTY!!!"" Bughuul's face suddenly pops up and it's implied that Deputy is killed."

He discovers that the place has been cursed with dark magic, implying that 36th was murdered.Kaulder brings 37th to a bakery run by Max Schlesinger (Isaach de Bankole), who uses magic creatures in his food to enchant customers. He has done shady dealings with witches and warlocks, leading them to suspect that Max gave something valuable to a warlock named Ellic (Joseph Gilgun), who was sent by someone worse to look for something in 36th's apartment. Kaulder brings Ellic before a council of witches led by Glaeser (Rena Owen) to determine Ellic's fate. He is imprisoned by them.Kaulder and 37th go to 36th's body and realize that he's not dead, but cursed, and the only way to break the curse is to kill the witch or warlock that did it to him. Back in the apartment, Kaulder notices a book that 36th left clues in. On three separate pages, the words ""remember"", ""your"", and ""death"" have bloody fingerprints on them. Kaulder knows it's a message, and he states that there's only one way for him to remember his death: magic.Kaulder goes to a witch bar run by Chloe (Rose Leslie), who is a special type of witch known as a Dreamwalker. As he enters the bar, all the other witches and warlocks head for the hills, knowing of the witch hunter's brutal reputation against their kind. Kaulder approaches Chloe and asks for a memory spell to remember his death. She injects such a spell into a cherry for Kaulder to consume. He pops the cherry in his mouth and lays back, making Chloe think he's passed out. She takes the opportunity for a witch hunter selfie, but Kaulder is still awake. He then swallows the cherry for real and sees himself walking toward the burning tree where he fought the Witch Queen. He enters and sees his charred corpse, but before anything else can be shown, a warlock named Belial (Olafur Darri Olafsson) pulls him out of the spell and has Kaulder chained to the floor. Kaulder breaks the bones in his hand to release himself as Belial lights the bar on fire. Kaulder and Chloe get out of there in time as the place is destroyed.Chloe wakes up in an apartment and wanders through it. Dark forces begin to rip through the apartment and she briefly appears to be pulled into the walls where she sees a monstrous entity. Kaulder's arms then appear to pull Chloe out until she reawakens to the real world. She's pissed at Kaulder for causing the destruction of her bar, but he still needs a memory spell to figure out what he needs to remember from his death. Knowing that Chloe is a Dreamwalker and that she doesn't need a liquid potion to help Kaulder, he gets her to take both of them into his mind to remember the day he died. They find his charred body again, but this time, they hide as the Axe and Cross arrive. They see the Witch Queen's corpse crumble, leaving her heart still beating. The Dolan tries to stab it, but the burnt Kaulder awakens and screams in pain. Realizing that the heart can't be destroyed without killing Kaulder for good, the Dolan takes the heart with him, leading present day Kaulder to figure out that the Axe and Cross betrayed him and let him endure immortality.Chloe receives a phone call from her friend Miranda (Aimee Carrero), whom she last saw as Kaulder arrived at the bar. The two find Miranda dead after Belial got through with her. He calls them from Miranda's phone to taunt Kaulder.Kaulder and Chloe go to a place where witches are disguised as beautiful women with the power of magic gems that conceal their ugliness. They find the leader, Danique (Dawn Olivieri), who puts Kaulder under a trance where he sees Helena and Elizabeth. Chloe enters Kaulder's mind and breaks him out of the trance. They then interrogate Danique over her business with Belial. She confesses that he helped them obtain the gems in return for helping him obtain the heart of the Witch Queen. Before they leave, Chloe crushes Danique's gem, making her look like a hag once again.Belial locates the Witch Queen's heart with the council of witches, all of whom he murders. He releases Ellic and takes Max to use him as a cocoon to bring the Queen back after burying the heart in the dirt next to Max. Kaulder arrives and finds Max held up by roots. Belial appears from behind but Kaulder kills him with a dagger to the throat. The Witch Queen is already half-alive until she uses a root to grab Kaulder and use his immortality (which she says was always meant for her) to fully return. She peels off Max's skin and emerges in her true form before setting off to unleash her plague upon humanity.Kaulder returns home to find 36th, reawakened after Belial's death. Although Kaulder thinks he's failed in stopping the Witch Queen and is discouraged by the Axe and Cross's deception, 36th encourages him to do what he's always done best.The Witch Queen uses Ellic as a vessel to unleash her plague. Kaulder and Chloe find him in a trance. Chloe enters Ellic's mind to kill him and stop the plague while Kaulder goes after the Queen. Chloe fights Ellic in his mind and pushes him down a hole where he lands on his face and dies, holding off the plague. Still, the Queen's dark magic is spreading across the city. Kaulder battles her and nearly kills her until 37th enters, holding Chloe at gunpoint. He reveals that the witches Kaulder killed in 37th's youth weren't attacking his parents, they WERE his parents. He gives Chloe to the Witch Queen in the hope that she will grant him the magic that he was born without, but the Queen refuses and kills 37th. The Queen possesses Chloe and continues to spread the plague. Kaulder resumes his fight after being motivated by a vision of Helena and Elizabeth. As the Queen uses her powers against Kaulder, he grabs his sword and hurls it into the Queen's chest, where it combines with falling lightning bolts to destroy the Queen once again. As her body crumbles, her heart is exposed again. Kaulder is ready to permanently get rid of her and himself, but Chloe stops him.Despite retaining his immortality, Kaulder is more at peace than before, now having found a new reason to keep living. He joins Chloe as they drive trough the city on another adventure."

An American moves his family to Asia because of his work. But the day after he arrives he goes out of his hotel and sees a mob and they have a confrontation with the police and people are killed. He sees them execute a foreigner. He then goes back to the hotel and tries to get his family out but the mob surrounds the hotel. He learns the mob is there because it seems like the intentions of the company he works for is not as benevolent as they claim. So he tries to get his family out but they're trapped. A man whom they met when they arrive tries to help them.—rcs0411@yahoo.com The American engineer Jack Dwyer is expatriated to Southeast Asia to work in the water plant of his company. He travels with his wife Annie and their daughters Lucy and Beeze and befriends the English Hammond at the airport. Nobody from his company comes to take Jack and his family to the hotel and he accepts the ride offered by Hammond with his local friend Kenny Rogers. Soon Jack notes that the television, telephone, Internet and cellular do not work and the front desk explains that they are facing problems. On the next morning, Jack walks to the market to buy a newspaper, he discovers that there is a revolution in the country and the rebels are executing foreigners. Now his only hope is to reach the American Embassy with his family. But the rebels are everywhere and Jack does not speak or read the language of the country.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In high hopes of starting afresh, the down-on-his-luck Texan businessman, Jack Dwyer, relocates with his wife and their two young daughters to an exotic Asian country, after taking a promising new job. However, there, too, things are far from perfect, as the Prime Minister's brutal assassination leads to a daring political coup, plunging the land into explosive turmoil. Now, with the local death squads executing travellers and foreigners alike, Jack must safely navigate through the battle-scarred city and the angry mob, to get to the American Embassy in one piece. Amid chaos and death, Jack's only ally seems to be the grizzled Brit, Hammond; however, can he get them out of the endless war-zone before it's too late?—Nick Riganas In an unnamed country in Southeast Asia (either Laos or Thailand or Burma), the prime minister is in a meeting with a diplomat about a crisis at his residence on a calm night. A few minutes later, gunshots are heard. A security agent runs toward the sound and sees both the prime minister and diplomat dead, murdered by a group of rebels with red scarfs wrapped around their necks. The man encounters the armed rebels, and, realizing he is outnumbered, he grabs a dagger and slashes his own throat.17 hours earlierJack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is flying with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and young daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare) to the same Southeast Asian location where he will start working for a new company, Cardiff. On the plane, the family meets an Englishman called Hammond (Pierce Brosnan). Beeze asks him about the scars on his hand and face. He claims they came from a tiger fight (in which he pulled out the tiger's tooth) and from falling down the stairs. At the airport, Hammond offers to share a ride with them provided by his friend Kenny Roger (Sahajak Boonthanakit), which he says is his nickname because he looks like the singer.The Dwyers make it to their hotel. A little later, Jack finds Annie crying in her room, unhappy about uprooting their lives here. He tries to turn on the TV but there is no signal. Jack learns from the clerk downstairs that all the cable and internet across the city is down. Jack then goes to a nearby bar where he finds Hammond and Kenny drunk and singing karaoke. He shares a drink with Hammond, who assures him that he will enjoy it there.The next morning, Jack tries to get a newspaper. The clerk tells him to go to a nearby store to find one. Jack walks to the store and the clerk there sells him an American paper from three days ago. When Jack walks outside, he sees a huge mob of armed civilians walking toward an equally large group of police in riot gear. One civilian throws a rock, and the cops start shooting at them. Jack is caught in the middle of the chaos and runs toward safety. Everywhere he runs, he finds rebels killing innocent people. Jack runs back to the hotel and sees the rebels seize and execute an American man who also works for Cardiff. The rebels spot Jack and chase him, but he climbs up a fire escape and escapes.Jack runs back to the hotel and sees the rebels have started breaking in and are killing the staff and other guests. He runs back to his room to get Annie and the girls, but Annie says that Lucy went to the pool by herself because she was acting out. Jack runs to get her while Annie stays in the room with Beeze. The rebels are knocking down doors and storming into rooms to kill foreigners. Annie holds the door back while telling Beeze to stay hidden. Meanwhile, Jack finds Lucy and grabs her just as the rebels start running into the pool area. Jack runs back toward the room and is almost attacked by a rebel until Hammond comes in at the right moment to kill the rebel. He tells Jack to take his family to the roof.Jack gets Annie and the girls up to the roof where other foreigners are gathered. Outside the hotel, the rebels are chanting. A French hotel guest interprets what they are chanting (""Don't resist. There will be no prisoners, because [they're] going to kill [us] anyway."", ""Blood for water!"") Upon questioning an injured hotel bellhop, they learn that the rebels are protesting the foreign corporations' control of the nation's water supply. A helicopter then flies up over the roof, making everyone think that they're being rescued. Unfortunately, the helicopter is carrying more rebels. Jack and Annie grab their girls and run as one rebel opens fire on the foreigners. As they run for cover, the helicopter gets tangled in some wires and is pulled to the roof, causing it to explode, killing all the rebels on board.The other rebels start to make their way up to the roof and kill anyone in their path, both foreigners and locals. Jack tells Annie they need to get to the roof on the next building, which means making a huge leap. Annie hesitates but runs over and lands on the roof, scraping her knees and elbows. Jack throws Beeze without warning, but Annie catches her. He is about to throw Lucy next, but she stops him mid-toss and nearly causes both her and Jack to fall over the building until he pulls her up. Lucy gets thrown and Annie catches her, and then Jack makes his leap. They get inside the building, but the rebels start attacking it with a tank. Jack gets his family hidden inside one of the empty office rooms as the rebels continue killing people. Jack assures the girls that he loves them.Some minutes later, a rebel walks into the room as it's become quiet. He spots Jack and starts to call to his comrades. Jack tackles him and tries to keep him quiet, but the rebel continues to shout, leaving Jack with no choice but to bludgeon the man to death, to Annie's horror and his own.As nighttime comes, the Dwyers find a map, take clothes from the dead office workers to disguise themselves as locals, and make their way to the American embassy on a stolen moped. On the way, they manage to ride through a crowd of rebel demonstrators; one man notices they are foreigners, but says nothing, upon seeing the two young children riding with him.The Dwyers reach the embassy, which has a blockade on both sides. Jack climbs over the wall and sees all the Americans dead. A mob of rebels and protesters had apparently stormed the building earlier and killed everyone. He sees a small group of rebels run out of the embassy as it explodes. Jack runs back to his family.The Dwyers seek shelter in a Buddhist shrine after pleading with the caretaker to let them stay. But, predictably, a squad of rebels show up. They kick the caretaker around and then try to find the Dwyers. Jack sees one rebel left his gun unguarded, so he tries to go for it. When it looks like he's about to get caught, Annie stands up and calls attention to herself. The rebel leader punches her and lays her down to rape her, until Hammond shows up. He and Kenny shoot the all rebels dead, except for the leader, who gets away.Hammond takes the family and Kenny to a local brothel, since it's apparently the one place the rebels do not appear to want to tear through. Hammond explains to Jack that the people he works for are responsible for bringing American companies like Cardiff out there to control the water supply, so Hammond feels he must redeem himself by helping the Dwyers. He tells them that they need to take a boat toward the Vietnamese border where the rebels cannot touch them.As the group makes their way to their destination, more rebels appear and attack from a gun tower nearby. The Dwyers get away, but Kenny is killed while Hammond shoots and kills most of the rebels, but he gets wounded. Knowing he is dying, Hammond tells Jack to keep going, just as a rebel comes riding in a truck. Hammond musters enough strength to shoot the rebel dead, just as the truck plows into him and crashes.The Dwyers make it to the riverbank where Jack trades his watch and shoes to a fisherman for his boat to take him across the border. Annie and the girls hide as a group of more rebel troops appear and begin shooting. Jack fights back, but he gets overpowered and is shot in his arm. Lucy runs toward him, and the rebel leader grabs her. He gives her a gun and forces her to shoot Jack, and then holds a gun to her head as an incentive. Annie runs in and whacks the leader over the head and beats him to death while Jack grabs the gun and kills the rest of the rebels.The family gets on the boat where Jack and Annie paddle toward the Vietnamese border. The Vietnamese border troops spot them and order them to stop, but Jack says he will not and pleads with them to let him and his family in as another group of rebels show up in a truck and drive near the family. Before they can do anything, the boat passes through the border, officially entering Vietnamese territory. The Vietnamese troops order the rebels to stand down, finally ending the family's trouble.The Dwyers are recovering in a hospital bed together. Lucy asks her parents to tell the story of how she was born. Jack says how he told Annie to push until Lucy came out, but she didn't start breathing when the doctors spanked her. Annie had told Jack to speak to Lucy since she would know his voice. Jack spoke to her until she started breathing. Jack then holds his family closely."

Ricki has a rock band that plays a regular gig at a small bar, when she is not working as a cashier to make ends meet. Julie recently attempted suicide because her husband cheated on her and is divorcing her. Despite being broke, Ricki comes to Indianapolis to help her daughter, but Julie is hostile. Likewise, her two sons are hostile and unwelcoming.. The film opens on the interior of a dive bar in California. Ricki (Meryl Streep), a middle-aged woman, is on the stage performing for a crowd of regulars with her band, ""The Flash."" She reveals she is having a romantic relationship with her guitarist Greg (Rick Springfield) and the crowd hoots and hollers, particularly the gay bartender. Ricki then announces they are going to attempt a more modern song at the request of some younger patrons, and they perform Lady GaGa's ""Bad Romance"".Ricki then gets a call from her ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline). He informs her that their adult daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer) (note: Meryl Streep's real-life daughter) has had a mental breakdown after being left by her husband and that she needs the presence of her mother. Despite being relatively poor (Ricki, whose real name is Linda, works at a Whole Foods style grocery store called Total Foods) Ricki scrapes up the money to fly to Indianapolis.She arrives at the home Pete shares with his current wife Maureen (Audra McDonald), who is out of town on business, and marvels at how fancy and clean everything is. She encounters Julie, who is unbathed and disheveled. Julie does not welcome her mother's presence, and we discover that Ricki left the family when Julie was still a child to pursue her dream of being a rock singer. She also left behind sons Joshua and Daniel. The family arranges to have dinner together.When at the restaurant, none of Ricki's children seem particularly thrilled to see her. Straight-laced Daniel has a new fiance who is prim and proper, and Ricki keeps inadvertently offending her. They make it clear Ricki is not invited to the wedding. Gay Joshua gets upset because despite being a liberal rocker Ricki is clearly not at peace with his orientation, suggesting that he might be dating a woman because in high school he said he was bisexual. She also expresses a variety of conservative views, including a dislike for Obama. None of the tension is helped by Julie, who seems to revel in stoking the animosity around the table.Ricki is told later that evening that Julie's situation is far worse and that in fact she attempted to commit suicide. Ricki takes her out for breakfast the next morning, causing her to miss a therapy appointment, and confronts her on this issue. She takes Julie out for a makeover and successfully gets her to shower and dress slightly better.

Ricki is very uncomfortable and annoyed at her presence, and everyone feels the tension even though Maureen is being very nice. Maureen notes Ricki is wearing her bathrobe, but tells her she can keep it.Shortly thereafter, Ricki comes out of the shower to discover Maureen waiting for her in her bedroom. Maureen tells Ricki that she doesn't appreciate her causing Julie to miss therapy or giving her pot. She asks Ricki to go home. The two argue about the past and the fact that Maureen raised the children and Ricki was absent. Ricki says that Pete is still in love with her, to which Maureen very pointedly says ""I'm going to let you have that one.""Ricki returns home to her life in Los Angeles and finds that her inability to commit to her boyfriend is causing tension. There are several extended scenes of The Flash performing at the dive bar. Ricki reveals that she lost her brother during his military service, which explains her sometimes conservative viewpoints and unwavering support of the troops.Ricki receives a letter from Maureen apologizing for the way things were left and inviting her to the wedding. Ricki doesn't want to go because she cannot afford the cost of travel. Greg sells a vintage guitar to pay for their fare, and the two go together. At the wedding, everyone is very cold to Ricki, and despite dressing down to look more conservative she still sticks out like a sore thumb. Pete's elderly mother Oma (Charlotte Rae) tells Ricki that she thinks she is a great wife for Pete, and Ricki realizes she has Alzheimers.Her children, however, are happy she came, though Daniel's wife is wary of her. She meets Joshua's long time boyfriend and tells them she is happy they found each other. At the reception, Ricki stands up to make a toast. She declares that she loves her children very much but that she couldn't figure out what kind of a gift to give her son for his wedding. She then declares that all she really has is music, and heads to the stage. The reception band exits and the rest of The Flash take the stage, and Ricki sings the married couple a song. Maureen and Pete respond to this warmly, as do her children, but Daniel's wife is reluctantly pulled onto the dance floor for a first dance.Slowly the younger people move to the floor to dance, though most of the crowd just stared disapprovingly. Ricki doesn't care because for the first time she is able to be herself, be accepted by her family and still be present in their lives. The band continues to play as the end credits roll."

Love the Coopers,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2279339/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The intertwined stories of four generations of Coopers unfold right before the annual family reunion on Christmas Eve. Can they survive the most beautiful time of the year? When four generations of the Cooper clan come together for their annual Christmas Eve celebration, a series of unexpected visitors and unlikely events turn the night upside down, leading them all toward a surprising rediscovery of family bonds and the spirit of the holiday.—CBS Films In anticipation of a great family reunion, happily married Sam and Charlotte make the necessary preparations for the memorable night. Everyone is expected: their children, Hank and Eleanor; their grandchildren; Charlotte's father, Bucky; her sister, Emma, and, of course, Aunt Fishy. Little by little, as the intertwined stories of four generations of Coopers unfold, well-kept secrets, unspoken desires, and intimate wishes begin to surface, just before the dinner on Christmas Eve. Sooner or later, the Coopers will have to realise that--even though it is easy to lose track of their shared lives--occasionally, unexpected encounters can bring hope and joy when they least expect it. Can the Coopers survive the most beautiful time of the year?—Nick Riganas Sam and Charlotte are divorcing after forty years of marriage. Charlotte convinces Sam to wait until after their grown children (Hank and Eleanor), grandchildren (Hank's kids Charlie, Bo and Madison), Charlotte's father and sister (Bucky and Emma) and Sam's aunt (Fishy) have enjoyed one last ""perfect Christmas"" before announcing the planned divorce. As scenes shift back and forth across the Cooper family members, their memories also briefly appear on screen as younger versions of themselves.. As is the annual ritual, four generations of the extended Cooper family are convening for Christmas Eve dinner at the Pittsburgh home of the family nucleus, Charlotte and Sam Cooper, married for forty years. They will not make it to forty-one as there has been one last straw on both sides in they having drifted apart in promises not kept. As Christmas is Charlotte's favorite time of year, she has convinced Sam not to tell the family of their impending divorce until after the holidays so that they can have one last perfect Christmas together. What they are unaware of is that no one considers these Christmas Eve dinners as being within the perfect family in their collective dysfunction. Emma, Charlotte's younger single sister, has always felt in competition with Charlotte, only exacerbated by their father Bucky having slotted them into specific types, as such Emma having been picked up for shoplifting in ""buying"" the perfect Christmas gift for Charlotte. Having been caught makes Emma's ability to attend dinner slim as she is escorted to the police station by emotionally detached Officer Percy Williams. Lonely Bucky spends his days at a local diner just to be able to spend time with a young waitress, Ruby, who he has befriended. He is saddened not only to learn that Ruby is leaving town for good in wanting to find a better i.e. happier life in what is a random move, but that she did not have the courage to tell him directly. Sam's care facility residing Aunt Fishy is largely in her own world in being in an early stage of Alzheimer's. Charlotte and Sam's son Hank, having just gone through a divorce from Angie and being father to three children, has just lost his job as a department store photographer, which he has told no one in trying to maintain his ""financial"" Christmas commitments, this only what he sees as his latest failure. Hank and Angie's oldest son, mid teen Charlie, can now only think about approaching his first crush, Lauren Hesselberg, without being too obvious in his feelings for her. And Charlotte and Sam's daughter Eleanor, flying in from out of town, has decided to hang out at a bar in the airport for as long as possible rather than go home in not wanting to face Charlotte's judgment for still being single. Reality is worse: Eleanor is in a long distance sex-only relationship, it necessarily commitment-free as he is married. In hanging out at the airport, Eleanor meets Joe, a soldier snowed in and who will probably spend Christmas alone in the airport. They make an uneasy connection, that unease due to their philosophical differences about most things in life. The Coopers' collective story is largely told by arguably the happiest member of the family, Rags, Charlotte and Sam's faithful dog who can view things both at an intimate and objective level.—Huggo"
The Lazarus Effect,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2918436/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of medical researchers discover a way to bring dead patients back to life. *** SPOILER ALERT *** THE LAZARUS EFFECT follows a group of researchers led by Frank and his fiancée, Zoe, who've achieved the unimaginable - bringing the dead back to life. After a successful, yet unsanctioned, trial on a newly deceased animal, the team is ready to unveil their breakthrough to the world. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is unexpectedly shut down and their materials confiscated. Frank, Zoe and their team take matters into their own hands, launching a rogue attempt to recreate their experiment, during which things go terribly wrong and one of their own, Zoe, is horrifically killed. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank pushes them to do the unthinkable: attempt to resurrect their first human test subject. Initially, the procedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong with Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team quickly becomes stuck in a gruesome reality. They are no longer faced with the question of whether they can bring someone back to life- but rather, the wrath of her return.—Relativity Dr. Frank Walton and Dr. Zoe McConnell have been researching a serum named ""Lazarus"" to help patients in coma to stay alive during interventions for three years in the university sponsored by the Werner-Goss Biotechnical. They bring the documentarian Eva to make a film about their discoveries with their team formed by Niko and Clay and their experiment with a dead dog. However they discover that Lazarus is capable to resurrect the animal that awakes with a different behavior. They decide to keep their discovery in secret, but their project is shut down by the President Dalley claiming that he had an experiment in direct violation of the Review Board. Further, their research is completely stolen by the Crylonis Pharmaceutical that had become shareholder in Werner-Goss. Frank convinces his team to return to the laboratory to duplicate their experiment to prove that they own the patent of the serum, but there is an accident and Zoe is electrocuted and dies. Frank decides to use the Lazarus to resurrect her against the will of his friends but soon the team learns that something is wrong with Zoe, who is Catholic and tells that she is trapped in hell.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Medical researchers Frank (Mark Duplass) and his fiancee, Zoe (Olivia Wilde), have developed a serum, code-named ""Lazarus"". It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life. With the assistance of their friends, Niko (Donald Glover), Clay (Evan Peters), and Eva (Sarah Bolger), they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog's brain. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project.. We see video footage of a dead pig lying on an operating table. A team of medical researchers are performing an experiment to bring it back to life. They inject it with a serum and hit the switch to their machine, but nothing happens. One researcher jokes about eating the pig, and then the pig starts to squeal briefly before staying dead.The team works at a university in Berkeley, California. One of the scientists, Zoe McConnell (Olivia Wilde), guides a student, Eva (Sarah Bolger), to the lab so that she can record the team's experiments and research. Zoe introduces Eva to her co-workers Niko (Donald Glover), Clay (Evan Peters), and Zoe's fiance and the head of the project, Frank Walton (Mark Duplass). While Clay ogles Eva, it's clear that Niko has feelings for Zoe. Frank explains that their serum, codenamed ""Lazarus"", began as a means to retain neural activity in coma patients, and is now used for the means of bringing the dead back to life. They test the serum on a blind dead dog named Rocky. At first, it appears that nothing happened, but Rocky begins to bark and move around. The team celebrates with a bottle of champagne.Frank and Zoe take Rocky home with them. The dog's cataracts disappear and it experiences a loss of appetite. It also displays slightly aggressive behavior. The team discovers that the serum is still in Rocky's brain, despite the fact that it should have dissipated within hours.At night, Zoe has a nightmare of being in a burning apartment building. There are burnt hands sticking out from underneath a door. Zoe awakens with a gasp. Frank comes in to comfort her.Clay is left alone in the lab with Rocky while he sits in his cage. He turns away from the dog for a brief moment, and he hears a crash. Clay goes to find the fridge opened and food spread out everywhere. He then sees Rocky growling viciously at him. When the team comes back, Clay mentions what he saw, but nobody seems to believe him.The dean of the university calls Frank in to chastise him for the underground experiments, unhappy that he and the team are trying to play God. Frank learns that someone has been giving the dean footage of the experiments that show them testing the serum on animals. The shareholders later show up at the lab and confiscate every bit of equipment and research that the team has after they are told that a major pharmaceutical corporation bought out the company that was funding the project. Zoe accuses Eva of being the one that told the dean, since this happened after she showed up.Using a security pass that Eva kept, the team sneaks back into the lab at night to recreate the experiment. Niko hacks into the security system to buy them time. The team gets another dead dog and gets it prepped for another test. Zoe flips the switch, and she is electrocuted. Frank rushes to her side and feels that she has no pulse. Niko hands him an adrenaline needle that he sticks in Zoe's chest, but she remains unresponsive. Clay brings over the defibrillators, which also doesn't work. Zoe is dead. Frank then sees that she had her engagement ring on her finger, which caused the electrocution.Not ready to let her go, Frank puts Zoe's body on the table. Clay, Niko, and Eva all argue that this is wrong since they know Frank is gonna try the serum out on a human being. Accepting whatever consequences are in store for him, Frank goes ahead with the test. He injects Zoe with the serum. She is still unresponsive. Niko then sees that the security guard is headed their way. They hide from him until he leaves, at which point the team sees Zoe sitting up on the table. Frank goes over to her and checks for anything unusual. Zoe grabs his wrist and asks if she just died. She then appears to be able to hear everyone's thoughts.At home, Zoe notices her fingertips look darkened, as well as the spot where Frank injected her. She tells him that she feels there is something wrong with her. She says that she felt herself in the burning apartment building, but she couldn't get herself out. Frank dismisses it as just a bad dream, like the ones she always has. After he leaves, Zoe moves a pen with her mind.The team returns to the lab with Zoe. She is left alone with Eva while the guys step out. Eva leaves Zoe to sleep. She walks out and finds herself in the same burning building. Eva sees a little girl standing in the hallway holding something in her hand. The little girl runs away, and Eva sees the burning hands reaching out. A burning hand then grabs her wrist, and she wakes up screaming as the guys find her. She tells them what she saw, and that she also has a visible burn on her wrist. Frank explains that Zoe had a traumatic childhood experience in which she was trapped in the burning building and that she saw her neighbors sticking their fingers out, unable to escape. Eva suggests that Zoe saw something when she died, and that maybe her soul is trapped.Niko is alone in the room on his computer when he's startled by Zoe. She begs him to help her figure out what's wrong with her, attempting to manipulate him with a kiss. He rejects it, knowing it's wrong. The lights go out, and Zoe disappears. Through a security camera, it's seen that Niko is pulled into a closet. Zoe reemerges and telekinetically crushes the closet with Niko inside, killing him.Frank, Eva, and Clay return, demanding to know where Niko is. Zoe appears calm and doesn't tell them anything. Clay tries to call for help, but the power goes out, taking out the emergency lines as well. He yells at Zoe for her to tell them where Niko is, and she uses her powers to choke Clay with his e-cigarette. Frank and Eva try to save him, but it's too late. They are horrified when they pull the e-cig out of his mouth. Zoe disappears again.Now realizing that something is very wrong, Frank and Eva attempt to catch Zoe with a syringe to incapacitate her. Frank finds Zoe in the hall, sobbing. He goes to her and says the Zoe he loves is still in there. She reads his mind and hears that he doesn't think she's the same Zoe. She grabs his head and squeezes it until his neck snaps. Eva flees after seeing this. Zoe then grabs the rest of the serum and injects herself with all of it.The lights continue to go out, leaving Eva in the dark with Zoe. Eva appears to get thrown into the burning building again. She encounters the little girl, whom Eva realizes is Zoe. Little Zoe hands Eva a book of matches, revealing that it was she that started the fire. Eva tells her that it wasn't her fault and that she can fix this. Evil Zoe then comes in with her skin burning and her eyes blackened. Little Zoe goes to open the neighbors' door as Evil Zoe comes closer. Little Zoe opens the door, and a blinding white light flashes before their eyes...Eva sticks Zoe with the syringe. Zoe apologizes for what she's done, and she collapses. Eva slumps over as sirens are heard. A fireman runs in with a response team. He goes to Eva and comforts her. Eva then sees that Zoe's body is gone. She looks at the fireman, which is really Zoe. She then breaks Eva's neck.Zoe lines up the bodies of Clay, Niko, and Eva next to each other. She puts Frank's body on the table and injects him with the serum from her body. Frank then comes back to life with a gasp."
The Witch,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession. New England, 1630: William and Katherine try to lead a devout Christian life, homesteading on the edge of an impassible wilderness, with five children. When their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, the family begins to turn on one another. ""The Witch"" is a chilling portrait of a family unraveling within their own sins, leaving them prey for an inconceivable evil. In the Seventeenth Century, in New England, the farmer William and his family are banished from the Puritan plantation controlled by the church due to differences in religion principles. William leaves the spot with his wife Katherine; his teenage daughter Thomasin; his son Caleb and the twins Mercy and Jonas and settles at the edge of a forest. They build a small house and a barn and meanwhile Katherine delivers the baby Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing with Samuel near the forest and the baby mysteriously vanishes. The family unsuccessfully seeks Sam out and Katherine becomes insane, praying all the time and mistreating and blaming her daughter for everything wrong in their lives. However, William goes to the forest to hunt since the crop has failed. Early in the morning, Caleb, Thomasin, their dog and the family horse go to hunt in the woods. However Thomasin falls from the horse and faints, and Caleb becomes lost in the woods. William finds Thomasin and Katherine confronts her about Caleb's fate. Is this the beginning of the tragic end of their family?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Banished from the bosom of their righteous pilgrim community, the troubled patriarch, William, and his Puritan family set out a humble farmhouse on the outskirts of a thick and dark forest, in mid-seventeenth-century New England. As the struggling family tries to settle in their new isolated homestead, before long, disaster will strike when their infant child vanishes into thin air, and, shortly after, other unforeseen and grievous calamities smite the God-fearing farmers. However, is this grave situation the result of a family on the brink of psychological breakdown, or is William's first-born daughter, Thomasin, the root of all evil?—Nick Riganas The film starts with William (Ralph Ineson), the patriarch of a Puritan family, on trial in 1630s New England. He dismisses those around him as false Christians, and the others claim that he speaks ill of the word of God.William's family includes his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), and baby Samuel. Having been banished from their New England plantation, they start a small farm in the wilderness. Mercy and Jonas frequently play with a large black goat that they named Black Phillip.One afternoon, Thomasin is outside playing Peek-A-Boo with Sam. She covers her face to scare him, but when she looks down, Sam is gone. We cut to somewhere in the darkest part of the woods where a wrinkled hand strokes Sam's body, moments before the creature lowers a knife to his chest. We then see a haggard old woman pounding what appear to be Sam's remains before consuming them. The woman then slowly walks out into the woods.Katherine becomes distraught following Sam's disappearance. The family believes that a wolf took the baby. Caleb goes out to hunt with his father, but first he starts to notice Thomasin's breasts. Out in the woods, Caleb becomes fearful that Sam was taken because he lived in sin, making Caleb worry that he is also leading a sinful life that will lead to his doom.William comforts his son, and they proceed to hunt. William aims his rifle at a rabbit, but the recoil from the shot gets him in the eye, and the rabbit runs away. The two return home to an angry Katherine. Thomasin takes the blame for her father for the two of them going to hunt.Thomasin and Caleb are by the river gathering water. Mercy comes along and accuses Thomasin of being a witch, blaming her for Sam's disappearance. Thomasin plays along with the accusation and starts to terrify Mercy. Thomasin says she is a witch, and that she will get Mercy if she continues to bother her.With a lack of growth on their crops beginning to turn problematic, Thomasin and Caleb venture into the woods. The two are separated from each other. Caleb disappears and comes across a small cottage. From the doorway emerges a beautiful woman (Sarah Stephens). She lures Caleb toward him and she kisses him before grabbing his head with a haggard hand.Thomasin later finds Caleb outside in the rain, naked and scarred. The family becomes worried that something evil is overtaking them. Mercy and Jonas continue to accuse Thomasin of being a witch, to the point where even Katherine appears to believe it. Later, Katherine discusses with William that they should give Thomasin to another family, which she overhears. Caleb is bedridden, and the family prays for him. After a while, Caleb begins to writhe and speak some sort of prayer, while Mercy and Jonas also writhe on the ground as if they were possessed. Caleb speaks as though he accepts that he is about to meet God, and he starts to moan passionately before dying with a smile on his face.Thomasin runs outside to cry in despair. William starts to accuse her of evildoing that led to Caleb's death. She angrily defends herself and states that perhaps it was Mercy and Jonas that made a demonic pact with Black Phillip. William locks his three surviving children in the barn with the goats until something happens.In the barn, the kids see a pale, nude figure drinking the blood of one of the goats. The creature (a witch) turns around and cackles at Mercy and Jonas, causing them to scream. Meanwhile, Katherine appears to find Caleb sitting in a chair, holding Samuel. She approaches them and takes Sam to breastfeed him, but in reality, it is just a crow picking at Katherine's bosom.In the morning, the goats have been slaughtered, and Mercy and Jonas have vanished. Thomasin emerges from the barn and sees Black Phillip charge at William, impaling him with one of his horns. William grabs a hatchet and seems ready to fight, but he then drops it, allowing Black Phillip to charge at him again and knock him into a pile of logs that crushes him. Katherine comes out and continues to accuse Thomasin, blaming her for the deaths of her family members. Katherine starts to choke Thomasin, who continuously tells her mother that she loves her. Thomasin grabs a nearby blade and hacks at Katherine's face until she is dead.Thomasin quietly walks into a barn and dons a cloak. She later encounters Black Phillip and demands to speak to him. After a brief moment of silence, we hear the quiet voice of Phillip. He asks Thomasin what it is that she desires, and tells her what he can promise to give her. Phillip appears to take human form and walks behind Thomasin, telling her to undress. She does, and she follows him into the woods while naked. In the middle of the woods is a coven of witches, all dancing nude around a fire. The witches then start to float in the air. Thomasin embraces the darkness and begins to float high above the trees herself."
In the Heart of the Sea,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1390411/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A recounting of a New England whaling ship's sinking by a giant whale in 1820, an experience that later inspired the great novel Moby-Dick. In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. A dramatisation of the true events that inspired Herman Melville's classic novel ""Moby Dick"". In 1820 the whaling ship Essex sets sail from Nantucket, Massachusetts. After a largely fruitless search in the Atlantic she heads for the west coast of South America. There she hears about rich whaling grounds several hundred miles west. After reaching the whaling grounds she is attacked and sunk by massive white sperm whale. The crew take to the boats in what will be an epic struggle for survival.—grantss In 1850, author Herman Melville visits innkeeper Thomas Nickerson, the last survivor of the sinking of the whale-ship Essex, offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but then finally agrees when his wife intervenes. The story turns to 1820: a whaling company in Nantucket has refitted the Essex to participate in the lucrative whale oil trade, and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a cabin boy. The owners hire veteran whaler Owen Chase as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is George Pollard, an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale. Almost three decades after the life-altering events that sent the ill-fated whale-ship, Essex, at the bottom of the cold Pacific Ocean, the epic whaling novel Moby-Dick's soon-to-be writer,Herman Melville, visits the tragedy's only survivor, Tom Nickerson, circa 1850. A fourteen-year-old novice seaman back in 1820, Nickerson recounts a story of greed, man's arrogance, and the omnipotence of nature, as Nantucket's veteran whaler, Owen Chase, and his inexperienced captain, George Pollard, came face to face with the ocean's ultimate Leviathan--an all-powerful bull sperm whale. However--helpless and stranded in the unforgiving open sea--the men would also have to face adversaries even mightier than the pale-hued avenger of the deep waters: despair, and the ugliest face of human nature.—Nick Riganas Herman Melville visits old Thomas Nickerson about the whaling ship Essex. The man refuses to speak but his wife insists otherwise, believing that Thomas has been tormenting himself by refusing to speak of his story, so he starts.Nantucket farmer and whaler Owen Chase convinces his wife all will be better as he gets his promised captaincy. But the executives have him as the first mate instead on his next whaling journey aboard the Essex, accommodating young Captain George Pollard, who is descended from a family of prestigious whalers. After they set out, Owen shows he's the de facto captain with his skills and initiative. One day the captain orders the crew to head into a squall despite Owen's warning. As the ship gets damaged the captain orders to turn around, but the waves wreak havoc to the ship. This starts open animosity between George and Owen, but they grudgingly remain allies for the sake of the ship's success.They capture a sperm whale, with Chase again displaying his expertise by correctly guessing the whale would not be able to dive deep enough to drag the harpoon boat under the water. Young Nickerson gets his first experience with whale oil when he is ordered to slip inside the head to scoop leftover oil. But no whale appears for the Essex for the next several months. After sailing far they meet a Spanish captain informing of them a large whale pack's location, but there's also a 'demon' whale. Both George and Owen agree to chase the pack, dismissing the 'demon' whale as a myth. They reach the place and soon find the 'demon', a 30-foot long white whale. It easily damages the Essex' hull, forcing the crew to abandon her. The whale oil the crew had gathered earlier catches fire, but the crew are able to save the three harpoon boats and some makeshift sails. The crew rations their supplies, but the supplies are very limited. The crew faces friction among them. Weeks pass and the men grow large beards and grow increasingly haggard. After days adrift, Owen spots the demon whale following them. The second mate Matthew Joy gets injured in a storm. Again Owen spots the demon whale; this time, it attacks the boats, killing some men. They get washed ashore to an island. But after some time, Owen finds a cave full of decomposing bodies and realizes that other crews that were stranded here waited in vain for someone to rescue them. Owen proposes to leave since no boats will come.They go, leaving the injured Matthew and three others. Some more days adrift, one of the men dies. As rations scarce over, Owen proposes they eat the remains to survive, and so they do. The men in George's boat even draw straws to determine who should sacrifice himself to be the next meal. Back in the present, the old Nickerson tearfully admits that the sheer atrocities of cannibalism and drawing lots to see who will be the next meal were the memories that he refused to share even with his wife. The crew again they spot the 'demon'. The crew cooperates and Owen gains a killing shot position, holding a makeshift trident that Captain Pollard had forged on the island. He and the whale exchange stares, canceling Owen's throw. The two remaining boats are separated by currents, but both eventually become rescued. Pollard's boat, containing Pollard and one other survivor, is found by another whaling vessel, and the vessels captain is horrified at the number of human bones in the boat. Owen's boat drifts near a harbor and is rescued by ships in the area. Arriving back in Nantucket, Owen and George are intimidated by the executives, who demand that Owen and George lie to preserve the industry's reputation. The executives do not want horror stories of monster whales and human cannibalism to spread among the sailors, who would inevitably quit from fear. But Owen refuses, claiming that it would be dishonorable to dismiss what the crew had gone through. George eventually tells the truth in the inquiry, and Owen moves from Nantucket. The young Nickerson meets Owen before Owen leaves, and Owen gives Nickerson a whale bone pin, a badge of whaling prowess that Nickerson had longingly looked at when he first boarded the Essex.The elderly Nickerson still has the pin in the present, and when he asks Melville what facts he will include in his story, Melville respectfully answers that he will ""add some, and leave out others,"" and Nickerson is relieved that Melville will likely not include the atrocities in his story. Melville leaves and Nickerson closes the door."

Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.—20th Century Fox Genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, he's the culmination of decades of research, endowed with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. Known only as Agent 47 (Rupert Friend), his latest target is a corporation that plans to unlock the secret of his past to create an army of killers even more powerful than him. With help from a young woman, the elite assassin confronts revelations about his own origins in an epic battle with his deadliest foe. Agent 47 (Rupert Friend), known only by the bar code tattoo on his neck, is an elite international assassin. Engineered to be an unstoppable killing machine, 47 is contracted by a covert organization to assassinate high-profile targets on a global scale. He's given the assignment to kill the leader of a crime syndicate who wishes to unlock the secrets behind 47's powers and harness that information into an army of highly skilled hit men. As 47 races to complete his mission, new information emerges about his origins and sparks a race against time as the agent is hunted for the secrets behind his skills.. In the opening text, the Agent program was started to create genetically enhanced men to use as unstoppable killing machines. An organization known as Syndicate International is seeking out Dr. Litvenko, the man that started the program. However, Syndicate has located a young woman, named Katia Van Dees (Hannah Ware) with ties to Litvenko.Several Syndicate mercenaries track down Katia's location and head out to find her. They are in pursuit when someone detonates a bomb in the street, taking out one of their vans. The mercenaries and Syndicate doctors try to find out who is responsible. They are cornered by Agent 47 (Rupert Friend). He kills two men before leaving one doctor alive long enough for him to tell 47 where Katia is. After this, the doctor is killed by a bomb planted by 47. The Agent then proceeds to kill every other man in the building.Syndicate's chairman, Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann), is informed of the killings at the research facility and demands that he be stopped.Agent 47 gets in contact with his handler Diana (Angelababy). He has two new targets to take care of.Katia is desperately looking for a man that she feels she has some connection to. She also doesn't know why she can see or feel things that she can't explain, such as when she senses a woman being attacked by her husband, leading Katia to hit a police alarm on the street to save the woman.As Katia continues her pursuit of the mystery man, she is found on the subway by a man who calls himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto). He follows Katia and approaches her, making it clear he knows where she's going and who she's looking for. They are found and pursued by 47, who shoots at them. Smith takes Katia away and arrives at an embassy. He fires two shots so that the soldiers in front can apprehend him and Katia.Katia is met by Sanders (Dan Bakkedahl), who asks her what she and Smith were doing, until 47 arrives at the embassy and intentionally gets himself captured after his huge gun (and other guns) are found. Sanders interrogates him and brings the gun to the room. 47 notices a tattoo on Sanders' arm for his family. He questions Sanders about them to get a rise out of him before kicking the table up to cause the gun to fire and shoot one of the cufflinks off the table. 47 beats and kills the other two men in the room and takes one of their uniforms, then knocks out Sanders after he says he is willing to die for his children. 47 slips out while Katia runs and gets Smith out.Smith takes Katia away to a hotel after another chase where she's shot in the arm by 47. He reveals to Katia that the man she's looking for is Litvenko and he is her father. Smith says that he was last seen years earlier with Stage 3 cancer. He asks her to tell him anything she can remember about him, right before 47 arrives and shoots Smith repeatedly, then knocks Katia out and takes her with him.Katia wakes up in a dark room, all tied up. 47 says he won't kill her, and that he wants to help her find her father. He also tells her that she possesses a similar skillset like his, so she can untie herself. 47 pulls a lever to reveal Katia is in front of a jet turbine, so she hones in on her skills and frees herself.As 47 and Katia get a move on, Smith arrives, turning out to possess some sort of super strength and agility not unlike an Agent. Other mercenaries arrive to kill the two, but 47 shoots most of them and Katia causes two more to get sucked into the turbines, allowing the two of them to get away.47 informs Katia that her real name means ""90"", indicating she is a more advanced Agent than 47. He has also known of her since they were children as he saw her being taken away from her home.They go by undetected through an airport until they eventually find Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). Although he is happy to see his daughter again, he doesn't want her to be around when trouble is lurking, which is why he had to abandon her. 47 sees some assassins disguised as civilians and kills them. He takes Katia and Litvenko away as Smith and other Syndicate mercs chase them. Smith orders the other villains to trap them in the city. They shoot harpoons at 47's car, trapping him, Katia, and Litvenko in the middle of the city. The mercs descend upon them, but 47 shoots them down. They still manage to take Litvenko with them.Litvenko is brought to the Syndicate headquarters where Smith tortures him with a painful serum until he gets Litvenko to tell him how to make an Agent. Le Clerq tells Smith to stop before he kills Litvenko. Le Clerq tries to get answers too, but Litvenko never budges. Meanwhile, 47 pages through the system and informs the villains of his presence, making them think he is in a chopper outside. It is really Katia, who is tied up again and made to fly the chopper into the building. More mayhem ensues and the mercs get killed while Smith and Le Clerq run away with Litvenko. Smith then realizes that 47 is already in the building. They have a supercharged fight, with Smith almost overpowering 47. He punches through a wall, exposing an electric circuit. 47 ties a garrote around Smith's neck and presses it against the circuit, electrocuting Smith.Le Clerq takes Litvenko to the roof of the building and escapes on his own personal chopper. Inside, Litvenko takes out his inhaler, only for Le Clerq to realize too late that it's an explosive. Litvenko presses it and destroys himself and Le Clerq before Katia's eyes. 47 then gets a call from Diana to confirm that Le Clerq is terminated, but when she asks about Katia, he throws the phone off the roof. 47 tells Katia that he needed to find Litvenko to put an end to the Agent program completely, but also assuring Katia that Litvenko loved her. They turn back to go into the building, but Katia senses that one more person is there to kill them. The elevator door opens to reveal Agent 48, who looks identical to 47. He says, ""Diana says 'Hello'"", before 47 and Katia shoot him."
Project Almanac,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2436386/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of teens discovers secret plans for a time machine, and construct one. However, things start to get out of control. Teenage David Raskin is a genius who dreams of attending MIT. He has a crush on Jessie Pierce but is too shy to date her. When he finds the design for a time machine that belonged to his father, he decides to build the device with his friends Quinn Goldberg and Adam Le, and his sister Christina. Soon Jessie joins the group and becomes David's girlfriend. When their experiment gets out of control and changes the future, David decides to fix the problems but only makes them worse.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Aspiring to follow in his late inventor father's footsteps, brilliant 17-year-old high-school senior David Raskin finds himself with his back to the wall, unable to afford MIT's tuition fees. However, things will take an unexpected turn when David stumbles upon his genius dad's blueprints of an untested time machine, and after persistent experimentation, decides to use it for personal gain. Before long, the first pivotal mistake takes place, causing irreversible ripple effects by the time travels of David and his friends, doing more harm than good. More and more, the already precarious future of the young adventurers falls apart, as each trip they take only results in more disaster. Can the ambitious Project Almanac fix the team's future to save their past?—Nick Riganas High school senior David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is testing an experiment with his friends Adam Le (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner) while David's sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) films it. The video is for a scholarship to MIT University. David shows off an aircraft he made that he can control with a material placed on his fingers. The gang sets the craft loose outside when someone calls David's phone, jamming the signal on Quinn's laptop to connect with the craft. The craft plummets to the ground and crashes.A few weeks later, David gets an envelope from MIT. He gathers with Christina and their mom Kathy (Amy Landecker), along with Adam and Quinn, to open it. David gets into MIT, but he only receives $5,000 instead of the proposed $45,000, to his disappointment.At school, we learn that David has a crush on a girl named Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-D'Elia). Quinn flunks a chemistry test in front of his whole class. Christina is bullied by the school's head bitch Sarah Nathan (Michelle DeFraites).Back home, David and Christina discover that Kathy is trying to sell the house. Later, David rummages through the attic. Christina comes upstairs and they find a videotape of David's 7th birthday party. It was the last day the two saw their dad Ben (Gary Weeks) before he died in a car crash. The two look at the video and David notices something strange - he, in his current age, is physically visible in the video. He shows the tape to Adam and Quinn, who both react with surprise.David obsesses over the video and notices details like that he has a blue stain on his shirt and that he's holding keys with a ballerina figure key chain. He looks in his bag and notices he's actually holding Jessie's bag. He goes over to return it to her and awkwardly tries to talk to her. He returns the bag and she congratulates him on getting into MIT.The gang goes to David's basement and they uncover a secret hatch in the floor that contains blueprints for a temporal relocation device, or a time machine. The boys get excited and begin to gather the materials they need to build it. After a few failed tests, they steal hydrogen canisters from the school to properly charge their batteries. They manage to activate something that causes objects in the basement to levitate, but the batteries keep short-circuiting.A party goes on next door one night. Jessie brings her car and parks it in David's driveway. The gang hooks up their cables to her car battery to test their next experiment: they are trying to send Christina's red toy Corvette through time. They activate the machine, just as Jessie comes in when she sees what they're doing to her car. The room begins to shake and objects start floating, and then all the power on the street goes out. When the lights go back on, the gang sees that the toy car DID go through time, and is somehow fused to the wall. They look on the GoPro that they attached to the car and see that it was already sitting there recording them as they set up the machine.Jessie joins the gang as they show her David's birthday video and prove to her what they can do. They get together that night in the neighborhood and attempt to go back to one night ago. They activate the machine and jump through time. The gang is left deafened and disoriented for a brief moment. They then run to Quinn's home where Quinn was sleeping the previous night. Quinn draws a smiley face on his own neck. Past Quinn then rolls over and wakes up and sees his future self. This causes a glitch in time, and the two of them start to disappear. The gang runs out of there and then excitedly jump for the fact that they successfully time-jumped. When they get back to the area where they made the jump, they find a dog. As they drive through the streets, they notice a bunch of ""missing dog"" flyers that weren't there earlier. They return the dog to its rightful owner.The gang starts to imagine the possibilities of their newfound ability and decide to utilize it for personal matters as long as they all time-jump together. Quinn uses it to ace his chemistry test until he finally gets it right. Christina uses it to catch Sarah moments after she caused Christina to spill her drink, only for Future Christina to show up and purposely spill drinks on Sarah, humiliating her and declaring, ""I'm everywhere, bitch!"" Adam has the gang time-jump so they can win the lottery. However, he only got five out of the six numbers right, and after taxes, they only make $1.8 million. Quinn still uses the money to buy himself a cool car and to bring a line of food trucks to the school. At home, Kathy ends up getting a new job, to the delight of David and Christina.During class, David pulls the gang out of class to meet under the bleachers. They jump to three months ago for Lollapalooza. They watch their favorite bands play and even score VIP passes (after getting them cheaply on eBay in the present) to go backstage and hang with the band. The gang has the time of their lives. They hang on water slides and party all day. Christina and Adam hook up. Before the day is over, David goes over to Jessie as she checks out the wall that says ""Before the world ends..."" with a number of things people would do. Jessie drops HUGE hints to David like going to the statement that reads, ""Before the world ends, I want to fall in love."" David misses the chance to make his move, and they later jump back to the present, where only 41 seconds passed.Frustrated with his failure, David jumps back alone to Lollapalooza and makes his move on Jessie. He kisses her and then returns to the present. He's in his room and tries calling Jessie, only to see her phone is on his desk. She emerges from the bathroom wearing only a towel. David asks her if they had sex. She says yes.The two become an item, but when they get to school, David notices odd things. The school's basketball captain Justin has a broken leg. Sarah walks by David crying. There's a banner hung up that reads ""Titans Basketball - Better Luck Next Year"". After school, David learns from Adam and Quinn that there was a plane crash that killed 77 people, including Sarah's dad, who was the pilot. The boys think that their time-jumping is responsible for this, as well as the basketball team losing the championship.The gang meets up at night when David tells Adam that he jumped alone. Despite Adam telling him not to do it again, David jumps back alone to the night of the party. After he and the others kill the power when they jumped Christina's toy car, David runs into the street and pushes Justin out of the path of a car to prevent him from breaking his leg. The other partygoers hail him as a hero. David jumps back to the present and sees that not only did the team win the championship, but the plane landed safely. However, Adam lands in the hospital following an incident after the basketball game.David runs home and tries to figure out how to stop Adam from being hurt. He gets the machine ready when Jessie comes into the basement. They both jump through time, and David is forced to explain to her that he jumped alone to go back and make his move on her. Jessie is hurt and admits that she liked David since she first met him, and that she would use the machine to go back and meet him sooner. Then, Jessie's past self comes by, and once they see each other, she completely vanishes into thin air, leaving behind only her car keys, which David grabs.Seeing no other way out, David decides he must jump all the way back to his 7th birthday to prevent the machine from ever existing. Quinn goes to his home after Jessie goes missing. David explains the whole situation to him and apologizes for his mistake. The police then show up to David's home, suspecting him of being involved in Jessie's disappearance. David escapes his home and runs to the school where he takes one more hydrogen canister. He is able to fuel the machine just as the cops barge in, moments before he makes the jump.David goes back ten years and makes it home. He sees himself in the mirror, right where the video first got him. He follows his dad to the basement and they come face-to-face. Ben recognizes his son and realizes he got the machine to work. David tells him that there are no second chances and that they need to stop this. The two of them hug and Ben leaves. David gathers all the components of the time machine and burns them. His body flickers repeatedly until he vanishes.David is back in the present, looking in the attic where Christina finds him. They find their dad's video camera, which has footage of what they were doing and saying mere minutes ago (them questioning how the camera got there, specifically).The gang is at school during the moment when David sees he has Jessie's bag. He goes over to give it to her with more confidence, and he repeats a statement that Jessie made to him the first time they spoke. When she asks how he knew what he was going to say, David leans in and says, ""This is gonna sound crazy, but I think we're about to change the world."""
Aloha,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him. A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs - the US Space program in Honolulu, Hawaii - and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him.—Sony Pictures Entertainment In this era of private sector billionaires taking over much of the work in space from governments, Brian Gilcrest left the US Air Force to work for one of those billionaires, Carson Welch. However, incidents in Afghanistan including injuries while working for Carson have left Brian on the outside looking in, he now taking any scraps of work even remotely related to space. It is one of those jobs that takes him back to Hawaii, his old stomping grounds. That job is to organize a traditional Hawaiian blessing for a pedestrian gate Carson is building in association with a rocket launch facility, Brian's responsibilities including negotiating with the native islanders for their participation. To ensure things go smoothly, the Air Force, who have negotiated a separate deal with Carson for him to launch a satellite to improve such things as wireless services, has assigned Captain Allison Ng, a space geek and one-quarter native islander, to be Brian's ""shadow"" for his entire stay in Hawaii. Brian's return to Hawaii is bittersweet in being reunited with his old girlfriend, Tracy, who he has not seen in thirteen years when Brian left Hawaii, she now married to one of Brian's old colleagues, John Woodside - Woody - the two who have two children. Regardless of the sparks of both a positive and negative kind that still exist between Tracy and Brian, there is trouble in the Woodside marriage largely due to Woody's unusual means of communication, which Tracy sees as no communication whatsoever. As Brian goes through his work, he and Allison start to fall for each other, in part due to their shared love of space and island life. Things have the potential to go off the rails with Brian's job and his burgeoning relationship with Allison when Carson's true long game comes to light within certain small circles, the issue being who knew of that long game and if they did anything either to support or thwart it.—Huggo A former US Air Force officer, Brian Gilchrist, returns to Hawaii as a civilian contractor. He now works for a private space company, owned by multi-billionaire Carson Welch. This return is a homecoming of sorts but is bitter-sweet: his best friend is now married to his ex-girlfriend and he still holds a torch for her. Then there's Allison Ng, the beautiful Air Force captain tasked with watching over him.—grantss Brian Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper) discusses longing and looking up to the future as a boy. We see him in military uniform, but he then mentions that the billionaires took over in 2008 after the last financial crisis in the USA, and so he left the military and took a job as a contractor, working for a billionaire, Carson Welch (Bill Murray). He had seriously messed up in Kabul, but he now gets to go back to Hawaii, which he sees as a second chance.As he flies over there, his pilot is John 'Woody' Woodside (John Krasinski). We are also introduced to Colonel 'Fingers' Lacy (Danny McBride), and Captain Allison Ng (Emma Stone).Upon meeting up with Brian, Colonel Lacy jokes with him about Kabul, and tells Brian he is a big deal in Hawaii. He also informs him that his ex-girlfriend, Tracy, who is now married to Woody, handles ceremonies for the dead.Allison Ng is Brian's Air Force liaison, very decorated and no nonsense. Tracy (Rachel McAdams) suddenly runs up to Brian though. She is surprised to see Brian there, and that Woody actually spoke to him.Brian meets Tracy's children, her 13-year-old daughter, Gracie (Danielle Rose Russell), and her younger son, Mitch (Jaeden Lieberher), who seems to be very interested in his video camera and talking about this Hawaiian god and the arrival. Gracie seems more interested in seeing her dad. Tracy invites Brian to dinner, and Mitch hopes he will accept. Mitch asks Brian if he is the arrival.Brian walks in on Carson talking with a biographer. Carson says he didn't abandon Brian, but rather saved him. He wants him to start with the blessing and move on from there.While flying, Ng tells Brian tells him about a meeting with the king of the Hawaiian nation. He tells her she doesn't need to call him sir, but she still does. She also reveals that she is 1/4 (one-quarter) Hawaiian.Once they get to the hotel, she wants to get peppermint tea, and discuss a wide range of topics, though he says there is no time for small talk or long conversations in general, and somewhat coldly tells her goodnight.From his room, Brian can hear Ng talking about him over the phone, to her mom. She gossips about him, but also claims to see greatness, but she says she also believes him to be a wreck.While Brian is ordering his coffee the next morning, he changes his order from a double espresso to a triple espresso since he has to be around Ng. Although he hasn't even said anything, Ng claims to appreciate his presence. As she peppers him with questions, he rolls down the window and howls like a coyote, in reference to one of the ways in which Ng had described him the night before. She finds out he had heard her then. Brian assures her he is just there as a private citizen doing work.Gracie asks her mother why her father is in places where the war is supposed to be done with, while Tracy tells Mitch to stop playing with the camera. Gracie tells her that she seems different, and that her bad mood isn't as convincing.Brian and Ng come to a padlocked gate to a sort of trail. Ng thinks that they're stuck, but Brian knows a shortcut, which involves hills. They joke over which one of them needs help.Ng says that she liked to dance but broke a bone and so joined the Air Force. Brian likes to dance, but alone. Ng calls him cynical and gets him all angry. He explains that his ex-wife left him for someone interested/involved with comic books. Brian tells her that he sees what she is doing, but his brain is unpickable.Brian and Ng come across an upside down flag, which means a nation in distress, Ng explains. They are at the nation of Hawaii. The king comes out and seems to know and be comfortable with Brian, as the two joke around.The three of them are sitting in the king's office. Ng is honored to be there, but Brian wants to get down to business and says he just needs a 20 minute blessing and approval for a new Air Force pedestrian gate. The king tells Brian his people are crooks. Brian says that it is his nation, but they are in America, with the king seeing it as military occupation.The three, and a bunch of others, are eating outside at night. They discuss the sacredness of the sky, and Ng absolutely affirms that weapons should not be allowed in the sky. Brian is authorized to make offerings to the king in order for the ceremony. The king wants 2 mountains back and free cell phone service. Brian says he can't really give that. Ng tells the king that she believes in Hawaii, and gives her word that the military will not put weapons in the sacred skies. She then asks him for the band to play music, and even plays the guitar with them. Brian and the king then actually agree on the deal, and the king gives him a flag.Ng says the sky is speaking to them, but Brian says it's metaphorical and that nothing is sacred and it's all for sale. Ng tries to argue in favor of the sky, but Brian just wants to keep it about their deal with the king. She goes quiet then. Bradley Cooper does tell her about a telescope he asked his dad for in 1983. Ng asks where that guy has been.Suddenly, there are shadows of people walking in the street. Ng tells him to stop the car and to look down. These people are supposedly ancient peoples looking for the souls of their ancestors. Ng warns him not to lift his head up, or he will be cursed.Mitch says that he misses his dad, but Tracy tells him then he will be home tomorrow, and that also Brian is coming over then. His mother gets him food from a food truck, and Mitch sees a truck with a strange oversized load, which he films.That next night, Ng is also over, chattering away and helping out as she tells Tracy about how she is 1/4 Hawaiian. Brian arrives, just sort of randomly popping in. Brian surprises Tracy with his presence and asks for a soda. He's brought her a poinsettia. He apologizes for Ng, but Tracy likes her. Brian and Tracy make awkward comments as to if each of them has what they want.While Ng teaches the kids how to salute in the other room, Woody is there, but he is still silent. Brian comes in and sees a picture of Tracy in a picture frame. Brian takes out the picture and sees that it was really a picture of her and Brian.In the kitchen Tracy tells Brian that Woody doesn't speak, but that he is a great dad. She then tells Brian she isn't ready to talk to him like a girlfriend yet. She tells him how she likes and doesn't want to lose their house, but that she is stressed out all the time with Woody being away. She tells Brian not to have any regrets and then admits she's talking to him like a girlfriend. They rehash their break-up, which involved Brian never showing up for their vacation. He saw Tracy as making it an ultimatum, which he did not like. She tells him he is a workaholic, and he says he is still working on that. She says that she loved him, and had plans, but he wrecked everything. She has waited and wanted to tell him something, which he needs to hear, about how he cannot just let people go. Woody suddenly comes in though. He comes up to touch Brian's shoulder, smiles, and leaves. Brian says he doesn't see what Tracy means, as Woody said a lot with his gestures.Gracie comes over to them in the kitchen and says she's picked out a dress for the winter formal. As she leaves, Brian remarks that her daughter looks just like her. Brian then goes to Mitch's room and admires his collection of space items. He admits that he did almost marry his mom when Mitch asks, but won't answer why anyone would break up with her.Instead, Brian notices a book on the arrival Mitch has. Mitch again asks if Brian is that god and tells him about the myth. Brian then tells Mitch to call him by his first name, and Mitch thinks that Brian really is that god.Ng and Gracie are doing the hula. Woody sees them and mouths ""beautiful."" Brian tells Mitch he is that god, and Mitch says that he loves him.Outside, on the Woodside's lawn, there are so many Christmas decorations it's almost tacky. Woody repeats that he loves his lawn.Brian, Ng, Tracy and Woody all go to a holiday event. General Dixon (Alec Baldwin), a very important but irritable man, is also there. Ng goes to help Brian get the drinks.Carson is there, talking to his biographer from before about the future. Woody looks at his wife. Brian asks Ng why she is alone on the holidays, but she says she would rather be alone. He tries to help her say in a more sexy tone that she is a fighter pilot.General Dixon comes over to Brian and tells him not to screw up the deal with the Hawaiians. He also admits that he dislikes him and calls him a bottom feeder before walking away. Another man, Bob Largent, talks with Brian and claims that General Dixon does like him, and then slips something into his pocket. He takes his drinks and sends him to wait for Carson in the hallway.Carson explains that they're doing what the country was meant to do, and are taking control. He was mad about Kabul, about how Brian destroyed himself by pocketing money from the Afghans. Carson tells Brian that he actually always knew of this, despite Brian thinking he never knew. He is giving him another chance though.Carson and Ng meet and go to dance, while Brian looks on amused, as does Colonel Lacy, who is the DJ. Everyone seems to really be enjoying themselves but Brian leaves.Back at the hotel, Brian inserts a flash drive, and sees that it contains top secret info. He sneezes and with how close their rooms are, Ng can hear him and they talk outside. She says she had fun. Brian says he's found nothing beats fun, but she says maybe purpose does. She comes over with her peppermint tea and laptop.Ng asks about the stickers on his laptop, which he says are for each adventure. Ng then says she's never been shot and asks him what it's like. They seem to be having a moment, but then he remarks about how he messed up in Kabul.In Kabul, Brian says he saw a missile coming but he didn't get out of the way because he didn't care. He then says that tonight was the first night he was truly happy he lived. They then kiss and are shown naked in bed together, in the middle of the night. Ng says she thinks she left her sunglasses somewhere, but they are also talking about something else, which turns out to be Brian's foot they are looking at. Brian explains that a doctor sewed another toe onto his foot.Brian and Ng spend a romantic day together, not in their uniforms, and with Ng even in a dress.While on a morning run, Ng seems to be in an even more excited and energetic mood than usual. She comes over to the Woodside's house, where Gracie is babysitting Mitch. Ng notices that Mitch is looking at footage he shot, which is the oversized load. They wonder what it is and guess it's a big covert operation. Ng seems distraught.Ng wants to tender her resignation to Colonel Lacy, who is amusingly at some kind of stroller exercise morning thing. Ng wants to know what is going on, but Colonel Lacy claims he was only told what they wanted to tell him, since it's a private operation. She thinks they could be filling the sky with weapons. Once she finds out it's Carson Welch behind the program, she asks what Brian knows, but Colonel Lacy says it's more like what doesn't Brian know?Brian buys Ng a hat before waiting to meet her for lunch at a little restaurant, complete with peppermint tea. He explains that the odd hat, which has sunglasses on it, is because of her having lost her sunglasses. He puts the hat on her, which covers her eyes, and understands her reluctance, as people have detached themselves from him before. He really wants to be a couple though. She is crying underneath the hat, which he thinks is maybe her way of saying yes to them. Ng then tells him that she knows he knows and knows what he knows, and for him to stop playing games. She got personal with him, had fun with him, believed him, and he had told her not to, which is what she is most upset about. When he says he needs her to believe in him, she just again says that she knows what he knows, and that he lied to everyone. He seemed to know about the rocket which was the oversized load, and that he was just distracting the Hawaiians. She is upset that he had her lie to the Hawaiians, especially when she is Hawaiian. Ng also tells Brian that he is lost. She then admits that she was there as his babysitter and watchdog, and everyone said he was morally bankrupt. She keeps the hat and thanks him for it as she gets in her car. She does ask if there are weapons in it though. Ng tells Brian that she was his last chance. He's sold his soul so many times that nobody is buying anymore.Woody comes home to see his family writing thank you cards. He says very little about work when Tracy asks, even though she is clearly hoping for more from him. Tracy follows Woody to their bedroom, where he blames Brian for their problems. She says that they had problems long before he showed up though, and she can't take the silence anymore. She offers to let him stay and says that she'll leave, but he says he'll go, since he's always going anyway.Outside, Woody destroys the Santa in the noisy Christmas display he was once so proud of.The next morning, Tracy shows up to Brian's hotel and says she has stuff to discuss with him before he leaves. She thinks he came there for a reason. By way of asking if he has anything to celebrate on Father's Day, he confirms that Gracie is his daughter. Tracy is relieved she told him. They look down on Gracie and Mitch playing below, and Tracy tells Brian Gracie has a lot of him in her. Woody doesn't know, as it's never been discussed, with how silent he is. Tracy then admits that Woody left the night before. They briefly hold hands before she leaves.The Hawaiians come together for a blessing of the new Air Force pedestrian gate, which will enable Carson to privatize space exploration. Everyone just looks awkward.Bob Largent suddenly comes to take Brian and Ng with him, since the rocket launch may have been compromised by a Chinese hacker. Ng does not want to be part of it, but is obviously stuck in the car with them.The three have to move quickly to ensure the launch, which is ahead of schedule, goes well. Colonel Lacy is also there. Brian gets his laptop to communicate with his friend, Roy, as well as Carson and the rest of the launch team. Brian needs to stop the hacker during the launch. Ng begs Brian for it to not happen and appears distraught.The launch seems to be going well. Ng walks in the room where Brian is working on all upset, while everyone else is relieved. Carson calls Brian to make sure the Chinese hacker is gone, which Brian took care of. Carson celebrates the rocket being in orbit. Brian soon becomes distressed himself, once he sees how upset Ng is. The king is also looking up at the sky.Brian then gets an idea, which Roy reluctantly goes along with. Brian explains to Ng that he's having Roy send the biggest amount of sound into space, which when released, will compromise the rocket. Brian and Ng hold hands as the rocket is ruined and explodes. Carson is not pleased. Brian tells Ng to stay away from him, since he's radioactive now. Ng still tries to go after him, but he just repeats for her to stay away from him, especially since she is just starting and he is finished. He tells her it's over.Carson is outside, singing the wheels on the bus. He tells Brian that he gets it, since he left Brian for dead in Kabul, and this is his revenge. Brian tries to tell him he can't buy the sky, but Carson tells him that he can't stop the future with such desperate acts, since he will just buy another rocket. He says Brian will just become a joke, and tells him his life will be very, very complicated.Brian and Colonel Lacy are waiting to meet with General Dixon. Colonel Lacey explains it's best to let the general speak first, and tells him to just take whatever he says. The general tells Brian its all his fault that Carson pulled out, and that he set back their footprint in the Pacific by a decade Brian claims he saw weapons, but the general tells him he saw a philanthropic effort. The general tells Colonel Lacey he told him Brian would be bad. He also tells Brian to stay away from Ng, because the Air Force likes her, and so does Hillary Clinton apparently, for her salute.Before she goes to fly, Ng is seen with a bumper sticker from the hotel.While in her kitchen, Tracy tells Brian that he ruined himself to get a girl, and that he didn't even get the girl, who was a good one. She also think its bizarrely sweet that Brian got them a new Santa. She reads him a letter Woody sent her, which says not to penalize him for not being emotional, and that he hated how she changed when Brian came back to town, though he doesn't like to hate, since it's not good for his brain. He admits he's not the original owner of her heart, but he is the better owner. Brian jokes he liked him better when he was silent. Gracie walks in briefly to say she noticed the new Santa. She takes notice of Brian being there before leaving. The rest of Woody's letter says that Tracy calmed the fear in him whenever he walked in through the door. Brian says he likes the letter Woody wrote, and that he lacks that romance, and Tracy should go be with her husband. Tracy tells him to go be with Ng, the girl who lit up his sky.Brian helps Mitch hang up his flag. Once he returns to the kitchen, he sees Woody walk in. Woody is still silent but subtitles explain that Woody knows Brian is Gracie's father and they hug. Brian says it's Woody's family and always has been, and that they all love with him. Woody asks Brian if he slept with his wife, which he did not, but he did sleep with Ng. Woody enthusiastically hugs him once more. Brian stands in the doorway while Tracy and Woody hug and kiss. She and Brian smile at each other with tears in their eyes. Gracie and Mitch also come in to greet Woody. Mitch says goodbye to Brian outside.General Dixon and Colonel Lacey tell Brian that he is off the hook. Nobody knew the whole story, that Carson really did have weapons. The general will take all the credit for the exposure though. Carson is getting picked up and taken away by men in Japan though. The general tells Brian to let Ng go, since she is on her way, and for him to get lost.Ng is outside the hotel in her uniform, ready to leave. Brian shows up and says he wants to know everything about her. She asks what he's still doing there and he just tells her wherever she's flying to come back, since he'll be waiting. As she counts how many words he's spoken to her, he tells her he loves her and calls her by her name, Allison. They kiss and he says he's staying. He sees that she still has that hat. He does have one more thing to do though.At night, Brian goes to Gracie's hula class and stands outside, watching her dancing. She notices him and seems confused with him being there, and he just nods at her. She cries as she puts it together that he's her father. She dances for a moment more but then runs out to embrace him before going back inside to continue dancing.During the closing credits, we see Brian planting along the Hawaiian nation."

Shaun the Sheep Movie,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872750/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When Shaun decides to take the day off and have some fun, he gets a little more action than he bargained for. A mix up with the Farmer, a caravan and a very steep hill lead them all to the Big City and it's up to Shaun and the flock to return everyone safely to the green grass of home. Tired of working on the farm, the special sheep, Shaun, takes his flock and the farmer's dog, Bitzer, into his own ""temporary escape plan"" after an unexpected accident. Unfortunately, in the big city, the farmer is diagnosed with amnesia, that could possibly change their normal farm life forever, and the squad sets a plan in order to regain the farmer's memory and return to the farm. But, an animal control worker named Trumper intervenes in their plan.—Gusde Fed up with the Farmer's inflexible schedule, and the tedious daily routine in the verdant Mossy Bottom Farm, Shaun, the naughty woolly sheep, is yearning for a short break. With this in mind, the mischievous lamb assembles the old flock, and under the nose of Bitzer, the ever-watchful sheepdog, they hatch an elaborate scheme to have a day off. However, as there's no such thing as a foolproof plan, an unforeseen complication results in a severe case of amnesia, with the Farmer stranded somewhere in the heart of the Big City: the realm of the relentless animal-control worker, Trumper. Under those circumstances, can Shaun right a wrong? In the end, is the grass always greener on the other side of the fence?—Nick Riganas The film opens with a montage, set to Tim Wheeler's ""Feels Like Summer"". The montage shows clips of a young farmer just starting out his career with a new flock of lambs. He bottlefeeds the smallest, Shaun, and lets the little ones run and play with his new puppy Bitzer. Sometimes he plays with them as well, and they are a big happy family of sorts. He also takes a photograph of himself holding baby Bitzer and baby Shaun, with the rest of the lambs gathered round them. He keeps this photograph for many years.Time fast-forwards to the present day, and Shaun, Bitzer, and the flock have all grown up. One member of the flock has a baby of her own, Timmy. The farmer has grown older, and stricter. And Mossy Bottom Farm itself has grown to include many more animals - a rooster, chickens, a goat, a cow, a bull, three pigs, and some ducks. The farm has also become a lot less fun; the Farmer now has a schedule hung on the barn door, and with Bitzer's help he makes sure the sheep follow it to the letter. Every day has become the same routine over and over - the sheep are led into the field, allowed a specific time to graze, are penned up for part of the day, bathed or sheared if necessary, and then led back. The picture from the days when they all played together has been dusty and forgotten in the back of the storage shed for a long time.As the days go by, Shaun and the other sheep grow weary of the same dull routine. After one particularly rough day of shearing, Shaun becomes fed up with the farmer. He spots a bus driving by with the slogan ""Take a day off"" in large letters on the side. Shaun decides this is what the sheep need to do, and starts trying to cook up a plan to make it happen.The next morning, before the farmer has risen, Shaun gets up early and tells the other sheep his plan. He goes out and bribes one of the ducks to decoy Bitzer away for the day, paying him in slices of toast. The duck ties a bone to a string. Bones have a hypnotic effect on Bitzer, and he follows it blindly. The duck leads him across the fields and to a tall tree, where he leaves the bone dangling just out of reach while Bitzer vainly tries to jump and grab it.The farmer comes to the barn, and after searching for Bitzer without success, decides to handle getting the sheep across the lane and into the field on his own. While he is doing this, Shaun whacks him in the backside with a wad of paper shot from a toy catapult. The farmer searches for the culprit and the sheep start wandering down the lane. The farmer heads them off near a gap in the hedge which has a small, short gate, and orders them to jump over it into their field. The sheep obey, jumping in single file over the gate. However, once in the field, they follow Shaun through a second gap in the hedge farther down, then circle back and do it again. In this way they have made a ring around the farmer of continuously jumping sheep. The farmer, of course, is confused and starts counting them. However, doing so puts him instantly to sleep.The sheep celebrate their success but Shaun stops them for fear the farmer will wake. He puts earmuffs on the farmer to keep him from waking. The sheep change him back into his pajamas, put him in a wheelbarrow, and search for a place to put him. They spot an old abandoned caravan left at the side of the road, on the other side of the field. They wheel the farmer over to it and lay him in the bed, shutting all the windows and drawing nightscapes on them. They then lock him in and proceed to throw a party, cavorting across the fields and enjoying their freedom. Once they tire of this, they go indoors and - making rather a mess in the process - fix themselves some food and drinks and settle down to watch a movie.The party comes to an abrupt end when a very angry Bitzer, having discovered the ruse, barges in carrying the duck. Reluctantly, the sheep show him where they have put the farmer, who still has not awakened. Bitzer tries to let him out, but the door handle breaks off instead of unlocking. The chock holding the caravan in place is jiggled loose as Bitzer struggles with the door, and suddenly the caravan starts careening downhill. Bitzer hangs onto the back as tightly as he can but is dragged down the hill with it. The sheep all grab hold of Bitzer as well and soon there is a line of animals being dragged behind the speeding caravan.The piece of the caravan that Bitzer is hanging onto breaks off just as the caravan smashes through the main gate on the road to Mossy Bottom Farm, and he and the sheep are left lying in the dust, watching it roll away. Shaun tries to lead the sheep in pursuit of it, but Bitzer is furious with them for having caused the disaster in the first place. He tells them to stay out of it and pursues the caravan himself. The sheep wait for him to return, but when he does not they eventually trail back to the farm, reasoning there is nothing else they can do.Bitzer chases the caravan until he comes to a stoplight - as it is red, he obediently stops. The caravan rolls on down the hill, out of the countryside, and starts barrelling towards the Big City. When the light turns green, Bitzer charges after the caravan once again. By this time, the farmer has awakened - however, having misplaced his glasses, he just thinks he is in his own bedroom, until the window shade rolls up and he sees he is about to crash into oncoming traffic. Mercifully, the caravan finally hits a level patch and slows to a stop; however, the hitch of the caravan collides with a street lamp, and when the farmer steps out of the caravan to see where he is, the giant bulb of the street lamp falls on his head, knocking him out. Bitzer catches up to the caravan just in time to see the farmer, conscious but woozy, being taken away in an ambulance. He pursues the farmer to the hospital, only to be thrown out because there is a ""no dogs allowed"" sign on the door. Now very worried, he sits on a bench nearby to figure out what to do.Back at the farm, the sheep find their plan to resume their snack and movie has been foiled by the pigs, who have taken over the house for their own party and locked them out. The hungry sheep go to the trough where the farmer puts the special sheep feed once a day, only to find it is empty because the farmer never filled it that morning. The sheep feed is on a high shelf, and Shaun tries to use a grabber that the farmer recently installed on the tractor to get it down, but he puts the tractor in reverse by mistake and crashes into the bull's field. The enraged bull rampages around the farm, releasing the hungry goat in the process, and the two of them soon have the whole place in chaos.The sheep begin to cry, and tell Shaun they miss having the farmer there. Shaun knows the mess is his fault, so he reasons he will have to go to the city and find the farmer and Bitzer himself. He packs a rucksack with several things he thinks he will need, including an old tape recorder, some binoculars, and the picture they took when the farmer was young and Shaun and Bitzer were babies. He writes ""Missing"" on this, and then when the regular morning bus stops by, he climbs onboard and hides under a chair, riding to the big city. Along the way he accidentally sets the tape player off, and it plays ""Feels Like Summer"". He quickly shuts it off before anyone can hear.Meanwhile, the farmer has had his headwound treated, and has been evaluated by the hospital staff. They ask him who he is, but he cannot remember. As his reflexes and everything else seem to be in order, the doctors decide his only problem is amnesia and write this on his hotel chart.Shaun's bus arrives in the Big City. After the rest of the passengers exit, he makes his way down the stairs and looks around the bus terminal to see if the coast is clear. He spots a scruffy little dog named Slip, who is foraging for food in a trash can. He waves to her, but a large and angry man suddenly appears on the scene, grabs her with a claw-like device, and throws her in the back of a paddy wagon. The side of the paddy wagon says ""Animal Containment Unit"", and by the way the man and the people watching are acting, Shaun realizes that stray animals are strictly forbidden in the city and that he is in danger.It is at this moment that a second bus comes in from the countryside, and parks next to Shaun's bus. To his horror, he sees the rest of the flock has sneaked aboard and followed him. The Animal Containment officer is still patrolling, so Shaun quickly makes them all climb out of the bus and under it. The officer spots the tail of one of the sheep, however, and gets out of his car, carrying his animal grabbing device.Shaun sees they are being followed and quickly has the sheep duck into a clothing store in the bus terminal. The officer spots the tail of the hindmost sheep again and runs in the store after them, showing his badge with the surname ""Trumper"" on it. However, by the time he gets there, the sheep have bought and changed into clothes that disguise them as humans, so there are no stray animals in sight. Two of the sheep, sitting on top of one another, are dressed up as an attractive female - having come up with nothing, Trumper gives up looking for animals and flirts a bit with ""her"", before returning to his wagon and driving off. The sheep leave the bus terminal and commence their search for the farmer.Outside the hospital, Bitzer can stand the suspense no longer. A laundry van comes to drop off cleaned goods, and Bitzer hides in a wagon full of scrubs, and is wheeled into the hospital. Disguised as a doctor, he jumps out of the wagon and begins to look for the farmer. However, just as he finds the room the farmer is in, the security officer that threw him out the first time starts coming down the hall. Bitzer ducks into the nearest room quickly, but it's an operating room and he suddenly finds himself expected to perform a stomach operation on a patient. He does everything he can to stall, waiting on the security officer to leave the hallway. His cover is blown when a nurse moves a bit to reveal a skeleton hanging on the wall in the back. As before, the bones have a hypnotic effect on Bitzer; unable to stop himself, he runs over to it, losing his scrubs, and starts eating it. The nurses panic, alarms go off, and Trumper shows up outside the hospital to retrieve Bitzer. In all this chaos, the farmer leaves the hospital, taking his chart with him, and begins wandering around town, trying to discover who he is.Shaun and the flock work their way around town, trying to blend in with the crowd and find the farmer. Many times, their cover is nearly blown, and when they accidentally destroy a pantomime horse putting on a show, they find themselves running from an angry crowd. They duck into the nearest building to hide, and it turns out to be a fancy restaurant. Having not eaten since their interrupted party, the sheep beg Shaun to let them stay. They try to fit in by copying what a customer across from them, who is clearly a celebrity, is doing - reading the menu, drinking the wine, and so on.Timmy is tucked under the table, since he was the only sheep not disguised as a human (he was disguised as a backpack) and he spots a trolley with cakes rolling by. He creeps out and steals one of the cakes. Shaun sees this and walks over, tucking Timmy underneath his jumper and trying to get back to the table unnoticed. However, a thread of his sweater snags on the trolley, and his jumper is pulled off of him and he is exposed as a sheep. He tries to flee and in doing so throws the whole restaurant into a panic at a dirty sheep running round. Food is dropped, people fall and crash into one another, and the famous celebrity has his pompadour ruined by a flying purse, horrifying him. Trumper arrives on the scene and takes Shaun into custody. As he is dragged off, Shaun notices Timmy's teddy bear lying on the ground and Timmy looking longingly at it. Shaun rescues it before it is thrown away but is taken into the paddy wagon before he can give it back. As the paddy wagon heads off to the animal containment facility, Shaun spots the farmer, sad and lost, wandering about town. But the farmer doesn't see him or hear his cries.The famous celebrity rushes into an upscale stylist's shop, nearly in tears that his big hairdo was ruined. The farmer, wandering by, sees a set of electric clippers dangling by the chair - they look remarkably like a pair of sheep shears - and the customer's masses of unruly, fluffy platinum blonde hair. A memory is jogged of shearing the sheep and before he knows what he is doing he has stepped in, grabbed the customer round the neck, and shaved his hair short. The other stylists grab the farmer and drag him off the customer, and the farmer is horrified at what he has done. The customer is furious, until he sees himself in the mirror. His hair is not unlike Shaun's little topknot now, and he likes the look of it so much he pays the stylist's shop a good deal of money. The celebrity and his fans share the story on social media, and soon the farmer finds himself hailed as a celebrity in his own right - Mr. X, Hairstylist to the Stars. He decides to embrace this new identity, and is hired by the stylist's shop, where people eagerly line up to have their hair done by him.Shaun is led to the Animal Containment facility, which is run like a hardcore prison under Trumper's steely eye as warden. The other two workers try to make it more like an animal shelter, but he undermines their efforts, liking the power he has over all the helpless creatures. Shaun is thrown into a cell, only to find that his cellmate is Bitzer. Shaun is relieved to see him, but Bitzer is absolutely livid with him and refuses to be consoled, chewing Shaun out for landing them in this mess. The other animals in the cells are unfriendly as well - a vicious cat has a cone to keep it from biting people, a morose turtle does nothing but count days until he is released, a rottweiler and a poodle lift weights and growl if anyone looks at them, and a big grey pit bull with bloodshot eyes does nothing but stare unnervingly at Bitzer the entire time. Trumper watches all this with sadistic satisfaction from security cameras he has set up about the place.Wearied of chewing Shaun out, Bitzer proceeds to give him the silent treatment. Shaun looks around the cells and spots Slip, the little scruffy dog he saw before, in the cage next door. She is happy to see him, and he her. Moments later, a young couple enters, having seen a sign the other two Animal Containment workers hung out asking for people to adopt the strays (Trumper takes it down moments later). The animals immediately go on their best behavior, hoping to be adopted. Slip, sits up and begs, trying to look as cute as she can, but because of her scruffy fur and jagged teeth, the people pass her over as too ugly. She cries and retreats to the back of her cell as the couple adopts a large iguana instead and leaves.The two sheep disguised as a woman come into the shelter and start flirting with Trumper, which surprises Shaun and shocks Bitzer. Outside, while Trumper is distracted, the rest of the flock have divested themselves of their disguises and are tying a rope to the bars of the cell window. Shirley, the biggest and strongest sheep, tugs and rips the bars and a section of wall out. The sheep celebrate their victory until they see they have only taken down the lavatory wall. Shaun and Bitzer's cell is across from it. The sheep panic and abort the plan when an alarm goes off. Trumper comes running after them. Thinking quickly, Shaun draws with chalk a realistic hole in the wall of the cell and he and Bitzer hide under the bench. Trumper spots the fake hole and runs in to investigate. Shaun and Bitzer swipe his keys and dash out the opened door, locking him in. Shaun frees Slip, and the three of them run out and join the fleeing sheep. Slip, who knows her way about the city, shows them the way to safety, and they all celebrate. Shaun returns Timmy's teddy bear and tries to shake Bitzer's paw. However, Bitzer refuses to give Shaun a handshake back, as he is still very unhappy with him.The sheep see a billboard advertising the salon that the farmer, AKA Mr. X, is working at. His picture is on it, and so is a map leading there. Slip knows that street, so she leads Shaun and the flock there, clearly enjoying very much being in the company of so many friends. The Sheep are excited, but Bitzer is not so sure, sensing trouble ahead. When they arrive at the shop, Slip keeps watch while Shaun sneaks in. He bleats to let the farmer know he is there. The farmer looks at him for a moment, but his memory does not return and he starts to shoo Shaun away. Shaun does not understand, and tries to move closer, but the farmer backs away from him, disgusted. The other people in the shop start to notice and someone calls the authorities. Shaun is heartbroken, and stands there in tears. Bitzer, deciding that they can't risk their lives if the farmer doesn't want them anymore now that he's a celebrity, runs in and forces Shaun out. Slip leads them into the sewers before the authorities get there and to the junkyard in which she lives.Back at the animal containment facility, the other two workers discover Trumper locked in the cell, staring down the pit bull which is giving him the same look it was giving Bitzer. They let him out, and he gets a special animal grabber that is also a taser, and a pair of special computerized goggles that track animal hair. He takes the mug shots of Shaun, Slip, and Bitzer, and vows to bring them back in.Miserably, the sheep try to settle down in the junkyard. Shaun looks at the old photo he had been showing around town when they were searching for the farmer, but the wind blows it away, out of his reach. Slip is happy to have some friends with her in her lonely junkyard, but she can't seem to cheer up the sheep and Bitzer, who seem to have hit an all-time low. Then, Timmy starts crying, and the sheep start to try to cheer up for his sake. Bitzer tries to comfort him with his teddy bear, but to no avail. Shaun remembers the tape recorder and sets it off, and the cheery ""Feels Like Summer"" starts playing. Timmy is consoled, until the ancient cassette suddenly breaks mid-song. He starts to cry again, and in desperation Shaun whistles the tune instead. Shirley starts vocalizing the tune's melody as a bass line, and three other sheep join her, harmonizing. They give a bouncy, barbershop quartet style rendition of the song. Another sheep starts beat-boxing, and yet another picks up an old bicycle wheel and plays it like a guitar. Shaun joins in the singing, and soon the whole flock is either playing or singing the song in a moving, sweet performance. The music floats out of the junkyard and across the city.In the stylist's shop, the farmer hears the tune and is intrigued. He steps into the supply closet, opening the window to listen better. A memory is jogged, and he starts to question whether he has another purpose out there instead of being a stylist to the snobs of the world. He pulls the chart that says ""memory loss"" out of his pocket and looks at it, reminding himself he really doesn't have a true identity yet. But his new boss calls him to come back to work, so he wads up the chart and throws it out the window, deciding to go back to the one thing he knows he can do.The wad of paper is blown by wind and passing cars into the nearby junkyard. Shaun gathers it and several other bits of wood and paper to put in a large fire drum that Bitzer has set up to keep everyone warm as the cold night sets in. As the fire burns, the chart unfolds. Bitzer sees the farmer's face on it, and he and Shaun fish the half-burnt chart out quickly. When they read the words ""Memory Loss"", the flock realizes the truth about why the farmer didn't want them, and Shaun decides that they have to get the farmer back home to Mossy Bottom to remind him who he really is. The question is, how could they pull it off without being caught?Trumper, meanwhile, is hot on their trail thanks to his special goggles. Even the most minute strand of wool causes them to set off an alarm, and he uses this to follows their route across the city doggedly, getting more and more angry as the trail winds on with no sign of the actual sheep. He is determined to catch them and exact revenge at all costs.Slip shows Shaun a big pile of junk not unlike the one they have at the farm, which they have used before to create all sorts of inventions. Shaun decides the sheep will make their greatest invention now, and draws out a blueprint for it, and the plan to get the farmer home. With Slip's help, they put the device together, and set back off under the cover of night to the stylist's shop. Upon arrival there, Slip makes sure the coast is clear, then gets the farmer's attention. The sheep set up a gate near the window of the shop, and in a ring, as before, start to jump over it one by one. Not only the farmer but everyone else in the shop and on the nearby street succumbs to slumber, leaving the sheep free to do as they please.The sheep capture the farmer and drag him into an alley, and their invention is revealed as a life-size mechanical horse, which the sleeping farmer, now disguised as a mounted policeman, is riding on while Slip and the sheep operate it from inside. Bitzer is at the helm, and he ""drives"" the horse down the street, only to run smack into Trumper. He is momentarily fooled by the ruse, and asks the farmer if he's seen the three escaped animals. The sheep make the sleeping farmer mime directions and Trumper starts to walk away. However, his glasses go off as he looks at the horse. He starts to run after it and trips. His head rips through the fabric and he sees the sheep inside, but he is stuck half-in and half-out of the ""horse"" and can't do a thing about it. Timmy beats him over the head with his teddy bear, knocking him loose, and the sheep use an augmented fire extinguisher as a rocket to propel the horse away from Trumper as fast as they can go. Trumper shoots his electrified grabber at the horse but it gets tangled round a leg and Trumper finds himself helplessly towed after it, eventually crashing into a garbage bin.The sheep and the two dogs stop the horse at the spot where the old caravan still sits, abandoned, on the sidewalk by the wrecked street lamp. They all pile inside, and Shaun lassos the trailer hitch to a passing bus, which he knows is heading back towards Mossy Bottom farm. Trumper chases the camper on foot and uses his non-electrified grabber to catch hold of the back, but they hit a bump and he vanishes from view, much to their delight.The bus passes by the farm and the sheep make the rope come loose, the caravan coming to rest in the spot where it was before the whole mess started. However, it misses the chock and almost rolls away back towards the city again, much to the sheep's horror. The Bull spots the camper about to roll away and, having calmed down from his temper tantrum earlier, runs over and rescues it, putting it safely back into place. The sheep, Bitzer, and Slip get the still-sleeping farmer back into the wheelbarrow, and start to wheel him back towards the farmhouse. However, Trumper was actually run over by the caravan and clung onto the underside. He climbs out now, practically insane with rage, and with the seat of his trousers completely stripped off by friction with the road to reveal his red underwear beneath. He starts to storm after the sheep and dogs, grabbing a large scythe from a nearby field to finish them off.Shaun spots Trumper coming after them and changes course, and the lot of them pile into a small shed, locking the door and trying to wake the deeply-sleeping farmer who has been oblivious to the whole incident. Trumper winds caution tape round the building to seal them in, and then uses the tractor, with its new grabber, to rip the shed from its foundation and push it down the lane to a nearby granite quarry. The barb-wire fence round the quarry prevents the shed from being pushed over more than halfway - while the sheep try to figure out an escape, Shaun manages to wake the farmer by waving the contents of a bag of manure beneath his nose. This wakes him, but his memory is still gone and he screams in terror and tries to back away from all the animals.Trumper uses the grabber to pick up the shed and lift it over the fence of the quarry, but can't figure out how to get it to let go. Fearing the end has come, all the animals huddle against the farmer in a tight hug, crying. The farmer is stunned, and then sees his reflection in the window of the shed. The positions they are in are not unlike the old photograph he took of himself, Shaun, Bitzer, and the flock when they were all young. His memory returns in a rush, and he hugs the sheep back lovingly, then proceeds to heroically barge out the door of the shed to confront Trumper. Unfortunately, his short sight made him pick the wrong door and he plunges into the quarry. Bitzer catches and saves him, but the two of them are now leaning out the door dangling perilously over the sheer drop. Shaun jumps out the right door and struggles with Trumper, trying to get the tractor to go in reverse. He succeeds in this effort, dragging the shed and its occupants back onto solid ground, but Trumper grabs him bodily and throws him into the quarry, intent on killing him.The farmer catches Shaun and saves his life, and hugs him affectionately. He sets him down and confronts Trumper, who, while a terror to animals, shows himself a coward in the face of an angry human and starts to run away as the furious farmer advances upon him. Then Slip attacks him, chewing on his leg. In trying to escape from her, he turns his red-clad backside into the bull's line of vision. The bull charges and butts him hard in the rear. Trumper sails clean over the quarry to the other side of it, crashing headlong into a massive pile of manure. Everyone celebrates and heads back to the farmhouse - the pigs see them coming, and hurriedly clean and vacate it, so the farmer notices nothing amiss when he goes in.As the farmer goes back to his own bed after his city adventure, Bitzer finally shows Shaun he has forgiven him by giving him a high five and then hugging him. Shaun looks around for Slip, but she is nowhere to be found, having walked away during the celebration earlier. He finds a note pinned on the garden gate, saying she has left now that she isn't needed. He tries to run after her and bring her back, and sees her going down the lane back towards the city. The bus from earlier is returning and nearly runs her over - the driver skids to a stop just inches from her, and gets out to make sure she is okay. Slip tries to look cute but her ugly face still has snaggle teeth sticking out everywhere. However, the female bus driver smiles and shows the same sort of snaggled teeth, and picks up Slip and decides to take her home with her. Having found a family at last, Slip is happy, and waves goodbye to Shaun as the bus driver takes them both back home to the Big City.The next morning, the rooster crows and everyone wakes up to business as usual, but everyone is going about it more happily and with more of a spring in their step. The Farmer and Bitzer open the barn and the sheep happily gather round the farmer, glad to have him home again. The moment is almost ruined as the farmer sadly looks at the schedule, clearly wishing for once they didn't have to do it. Bitzer makes the decision for him by grabbing the paper, wadding it up, and throwing it to the goat to eat.During the credits, images are shown of the farmer, Bitzer, and the Sheep enjoying a day off in the country. Trumper is fired from his position and becomes a street hawker for a chicken restaurant. The other two workers convert the containment facility into a true shelter, and Slip and her new owner both get braces to straighten their teeth. The farmer turns the news on to see something about Mr. X having disappeared on horseback, which confuses him a bit, and the Rooster comes by carrying a sign that says ""The End""."

Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2473510/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Using a special camera that can see spirits, a family must protect their daughter from an evil entity with a sinister plan. The Ghost Dimension, follows a new family, The Fleeges - father Ryan (Chris J. Murray), mother Emily (Brit Shaw) and their young daughter Leila (Ivy George) - Who move into a house and discover a video camera and a box of tapes in the garage. When they look through the camera's lens, they begin to see the paranormal activity happening around them - including the re-emergence of young Kristi and Katie. A newly moved family finds a box of old VHS sets in their house. The family consists of the married couple Ryan and Emily, their young daughter Leila, and Ryan's little brother. Ryan and his brother decide to watch the tapes, and soon see that they film Katie and Kristi being taught supernatural abilities by their grandmother. However, Katie notices the brother's presence, though the video was filmed 20 year before. In another box they find a camera that they soon discover allows them to see paranormal occurrences that the human eye can't detect. Soon Leila becomes the victim of supernatural attacks, and Ryan must find a way to save his daughter. The film opens with a scene from the end of Paranormal Activity 3, set in 1988, where Katie and Kristi watch as Dennis' spine is crushed by a mysterious force. Grandma Lois takes the girls upstairs while the entity takes the camera with them. A man speaks to the girls about ""Toby"" and how they are important to his plan. Twenty-five years later in 2013, Ryan Fleege, his wife Emily, and their six-year-old daughter Leila are about to celebrate Christmas, when Ryan's brother Mike moves in after breaking up with his girlfriend. Along with them is Skylar, who notices that Leila is talking to an imaginary friend named Toby. Mike finds a box of old video tapes, dating from 1988 to 1992. The tapes show a young Kristi and Katie with their mother and her boyfriend Dennis in 1988, while others from 1992 are in Lois's house where the two are practicing supernatural abilities with the mysterious man. Ryan and Mike notice that the girls are seemingly aware of the two's presence: they are able to foresee Ryan and Mike's every action as the pair simultaneously watch the video.. The film starts in 1988 at the end of the third film. A supernatural entity bends Dennis backwards and kills him. Grandma Lois (Hallie Foote) guides young Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) upstairs where they meet with a guy named Kent (Don McManus), whom Lois says will be the girls' teacher. Kent tells the girls that he is going to help them with something that will benefit them in the future.We jump to 2013 in Santa Rosa, CA at the Fleege home. Dad Ryan (Chris J. Murray) is with his daughter Leila (Ivy George) as they wait for Ryan's brother Mike (Dan Gill) to show up. Mike is staying with his brother after going through a pretty bad break-up. Ryan's wife Emily (Brit Shaw) doesn't like the idea of Mike staying for too long. Joining them is a friend named Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley).While going through some stuff, Ryan and Mike come across a camera and some old tapes. They play one of the tapes and see Katie and Kristi as kids while Mike records the events with the camera. Another tape shows the girls in a room with Kent asking Kristi what she sees. Based on what she describes, Ryan is a bit creeped out to notice that Kristi is describing Leila's room. Kent asks Kristi if she sees ""him"". Kristi strains and says yes before a skeletal blue flash goes over her face and the power in the house go out.Mike records the family as Leila puts the angel on top of the Christmas tree. When Ryan gets ahold of the camera, he sees that it's picking up particles in the air, and it sounds like he's underwater as he walks past it.
?Leila starts acting strangely. Ryan catches her with her bleeding hand pressed against the bathroom mirror while saying something backwards. When they leave, the handprint fades into the mirror before something cracks it. When Ryan and Skyler review the footage, they play the tape backwards and see that Leila is saying ""Bloody Mary"".Ryan starts to leave cameras in the living room and Leila's room. On Night #1, a dark spirit forms next to Leila's bedside. She wakes up and talks to it like a friend. When asked about who her new friend is, Leila calls it ""Toby"". Ryan walks into the room and Tobi vanishes.Ryan and Mike bring Skyler in to watch the tapes. The guys note how Katie and Kristi are seen with their mom and Dennis in some videos, but the videos of them from a few years later only feature Lois and Kent, and how cult-like Kent's teachings appear to be.Mike and Skyler are outside with the camera. They notice a ripple in the pool. A dark cloud appears to jump from the pool and go into the woods. There, they find Leila alone. It becomes evident that Toby's presence is only ever noticeable around Leila.Night #2 - Ryan and Mike are awake as they try to catch new footage. Ryan goes into Leila's room and watches her sleep. From the window, an entity with a slightly noticeable demonic face appears and flies toward Ryan, frightening him.The guys review the footage and get a better look at the demon's face. They later go into Leila's room and see that she's drawn weird symbols on her bedroom wall, which Ryan recognizes from some papers he found with the same symbols.Night #3 - Leila wakes up and follows Toby to the living room. She turns on the gas and leaves it going for a while until Emily comes downstairs and turns it off. She sends Leila to her room, after which the gas turns on by itself again. Moments later, the angel falls off the tree with a loud thud.Concerned about Leila's behavior, Ryan and Emily call in Father Todd (Michael Krawic). The priest goes into Leila's room and tries to talk to her. He rubs holy water over her forehead. Leila grins slightly but stays still as Todd asks more questions. After a brief moment, Leila growls and lunges at Todd, throwing him to the ground as her parents try to pull her off of him.Night #4 - Ryan and Mike watch another Katie/Kristi video. Kristi is still trying to describe her visions to Kent. What she describes is eerily similar to the room in which the brothers are standing in. What's more, Kristi says she sees two brothers. Leila then comes in, complaining that she can't sleep. Ryan picks her up, and she sneezes. Mike then catches Katie and Kristi saying ""bless you"" in the video.The adults dig a little deeper into the events surrounding the tapes and the girls. Ryan reads up on Hunter Rey (Kristi's son), who appeared in one of the videos from 1992, despite not being born until 2006 on the exact same day as Leila. Emily reads about a cult called The Midwives that uses the blood of two firstborns in order to bring something into the world. They also see some drawings of a creature with multiple eyes, something that Leila has made drawings of.Night #5 - A crack forms in the wall in Leila's room. It opens up a tunnel that she climbs through and stays in for hours. The adults notice she's nowhere to be found and scramble to find her. Leila later re-emerges in her room, seemingly dazed out. She says that ""he"" is going to take her away.The adults worry about Leila as she grows increasingly detached from them. They forbid her to be friends with Toby, but Leila won't listen.Night #6 - The adults stay awake and close to Leila. Downstairs, Ryan picks up Toby forming around Mike. They hide in the kitchen as they can see Toby through the camera, stomping and making troublesome noises while growling menacingly.Deciding that enough is enough, Ryan and Emily call Father Todd to get rid of Toby once and for all. He says that since Leila is not technically possessed, they aren't doing an exorcism, but an extermination. That night, the adults soak some sheets in warm water and draw a circle with a star in the middle on the floor that everyone stands in. They get Leila and prepare for the cleansing. Toby starts to shake the house like an earthquake. Mike turns on the night vision as the adults jump out of the circle as Toby lunges toward them, where we finally get a look at his demonic face. He becomes trapped in the circle as the adults throw the sheets on him. He rises as a tall figure and stomps toward them until Todd speaks an incantation that supposedly vanquishes Toby. Everyone thinks it's over, and Leila appears to snap back to normal...until Skyler's neck starts twisting and she regurgitates an acidic black bile that burns Mike to death. Leila runs away. Her parents chase after her, but Toby puts his arm through Ryan's chest, killing him. Emily then finds the tunnel in Leila's wall and follows her through it.Emily finds herself in the basement of Katie and Kristi's old home back in 1992. She sees blood dripping from the ceiling and she fears the worst. Emily then comes face-to-face with Katie and Kristi, whose eyes are both blacked out. Katie tells Emily it's too late and that ""he's"" real now. Emily finds Leila, grinning with her hand bleeding. A stomping noise is heard, and Emily sees Toby, now having finally taken on a physical form of his own. She pleads with Toby to spare her since he got what he wanted, but he grabs her by the throat and snaps her neck.The film (and series) ends with Leila taking Toby's hand and walking away off-screen."
Steve Jobs,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Steve Jobstakes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac. His passion and ingenuity have been the driving force behind the digital age. However his drive to revolutionize technology was sacrificial. Ultimately it affected his family life and possibly his health. In this revealing film we explore the trials and triumphs of a modern day genius, the late CEO of Apple inc. Steven Paul Jobs.—Anonymous Earlier, before the launching of the ""iMac"", the former CEO of Apple Inc, Steve Jobs must battle his own ego to solve his inner problems, including the internal conflict inside his company that cracked his relationship with his own confidant, Steve Wozniak, the continuance of his own family, and his passion to innovate- that affected his own health.—Gusde A full on view of Steve Jobs from 1984-1998 encapsuling three distinct product launches. All three events were SRO but the product receptivity was mixed. The film is fast paced and provides insight to the iconic Job's life. Flashbacks aplenty give us further background. Steve Job's many contributions may never be paralleled, yet his method was equally formidable. His relationships are examined and you are left to judge their impact on him, and his impact on those close to him.—J Morris Steve Jobsis largely the iconic name and face of Apple Computers, a company he co-founded. He always wants to be in control, in large part an outcome of his childhood, where he knows his biological mother willingly gave him up for adoption. That control often places him at odds with those around him, about which he doesn't care as long as he gets what he wants at the end, including a closed end system for each of his products to maintain his vision rather than users being able to transform his products for their own wants. The state of his life is presented at three specific times, on the day of preparation for the launch of three different products, each for which he is the lead: in 1984 for the Macintosh computer, it being the first new product for Apple since the debut its most successful product, the Apple II, seven years earlier; in 1988 for the NeXT computer, which Jobs outwardly is more concerned about the integrity of the perfect black cube design than its unknown capabilities, but for which he secretly has a specific end goal; and in 1998 for the iMac computer. The significant people in Jobs' life are also presented, they who are at the three launches, if not in person than in direct spirit to the proceedings:Steve Wozniak, Apple's other co-founder who sees himself more as the nuts and bolts man compared to Jobs being the big picture man, with Wozniak wanting as much of a focus on Apple's successful brand as opposed to Jobs' want to focus purely on his product being launched; Joanna Hoffman, his ethnic-Polish head of marketing for each of the three launches, and who acts as much as his mother figure and his moral center;John Sculley, Apple's CEO who is more concerned about meeting the wants of the Board and the shareholders than Jobs';Andy Hertzfeld, one of the two Andy's, who is chief engineer for the Mac and who needs to meet Jobs' every whim for the product, even if he feels it cannot be done; and Lisa Brennan, who the courts deem to be his biological daughter, a claim which he tried to deny largely to spite Lisa's mother, Chrisann Brennan, whose every action, in Jobs' mind, is for her own best interest as opposed to Lisa's as she claims.—Huggo The opening titles roll as archive footage plays, of science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke explaining how personal computers will be a part of our future.Cupertino, California, 1984.A 28-year-old Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), his right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), and one of the inventors of the Apple Macintosh, Andy Hertzfeld (Michael Stuhlbarg), are all gathered around a projection screen trying to figure out why the Macintosh computer won't say 'hello'. Its revealed they're in a performing arts center, about to do a heavily anticipated product launch for Apple shareholders and press. Joanna suggests that he just leaves it out of the demo, which is minutes away. Steve refuses and insists that it must work. He tells Andy he must make it work. Andy tells him that they need special tools to get inside the machines hardware you cant just use a screwdriver. Steve is furious but Joanna tells them not to talk loudly about the machine they're introducing to the world being hard to open; she points out that Joel Pforzheimer from GQ Magazine is in the nearly empty audience already, having been shadowing Steve for three weeks. He says he doesn't care. He mentions how he wants to sell a million units in three months. Steve then calls for Andy Andy Hertzfeld asks which one (since there is Andy Hertzfeld and a female, Andy Cunningham, who is in charge of the launch). Steve says that since Andy Hertzfeld is already on stage with him, he obviously wants the other Andy. She comes over and he tells her to make sure the Exit signs go off during the video presentation so there is total blackness. When she informs him that the fire department will not let them dim the lights for safety reasons, he tells her, If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits, it will have been well worth it for those who survive. Joanna suggests pushing the demonstration back while they work on the voice feature but Steve says they will always start exactly on time (this will come back to play throughout the film).Joanna and Steve go backstage. She tries to convince him to just leave the hello out of his demo, that no one will realize there is supposed to be a voice program, but he is insistent it happen because this machines success will dictate whether he is a success or a failure. He later admits that he needs it to say hello because Hollywood has turned the computer into a monster in their films. This computer is designed to look warm and friendly and inviting and he wants it to say hello. She acknowledges that HAL said hello and it scared her (i.e., the film he is referring to is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Joanna complains about both the $2,500 price point of the machine and the fact that it doesn't have much memory; he tells her she can complain about one or the other but memory will up the price point further so she cant complain about both. She asks why he is charging as much and he explains that its new and innovative in that its the first computer without programming language if he tells her she has a spot on her shirt, he describes it as such, ""not look three centimeters down from your neck and then two centimeters over.""Steve finds boxes of TIME Magazine in the back and asks why they are there. She tells him it was a mistake they were going to leave them on all the chairs since it talked about how personal computers were to be the future. But they changed their mind because it was a scathing article that focuses on Steve having an illegitimate daughter, Lisa, which he vehemently denied although one of the Apple coworkers seemed to refute his story. Steve complains about the TIME article, saying that they put a drawing of a man and a PC on the cover. He says he was up for Man of the Year but the journalist has some ill will towards him and that's why he's not on the cover. Joanna tells him Chrisann and Lisa are there and she begs him to meet with her, to keep her from badmouthing him to the 335 reporters in the lobby.Joanna brings Chrisann and her precocious five-year-old daughter, Lisa, backstage. Chrisann and Steve begin fighting so Joanna leads Lisa out of the room. Joanna has gotten to know Lisa acting as a middle man for John, which we learn when Joanna repeats that Lisa said she loves Joanna's speaking voice (Joanna has a slight Polish accent). Lisa tells Steve she knows he named one of the Apple computers, the LISA, after her. He tells her its something called a coincidence the machine actually stands for Local Integrated System Architecture. She is confused, wondering if he named her after the computer instead of vice versa. Joanna keeps him from loudly announcing his theory that Lisa isn't his daughter to her. Finally alone by themselves, Chrisann is frantic, saying that he inferred in the article that she slept with 28% of the country's population. He said he didn't say that -- but with a paternity test that says hes only 94.1% likely to be the father, he was quoted as saying that it meant 28% of the US population could be just as likely. She insists he called her a slut and points out that his Apple stock is up to 441 million yet her and his daughter are going to have to be on welfare. He responds by shouting that Lisa is not his daughter (hence his refusal to help out financially). Later, in private, Joanna points out that he must realize that Lisa looks an awfully lot like him.Apple co-founder Steve Woz Wozniak is introduced, said to be socially awkward (Seth Rogen). Steve Jobs notices a man with a floppy disk in his pocket getting into an elevator. He asks what size shirt the man is wearing, what size shirt he himself is wearing. He now wants a shirt with a pocket so he can keep the floppy disk in it and pull it out during the demonstration. He tells Joanna to find someone who wears the same size shirt as him, in white, and to give him his shirt in exchange, as well as a free computer. She tells him, ""Why white? What if its blue?"" He tells her the computer is beige so he must wear white to offset it. Andy Hertzfeld finds Steve and tells him he still cant get the voice feature to work. Steve tells him to fix it and Andy says they're not a pit crew at Daytona; they cant fix this in seconds. Steve tells Andy they didn't have seconds, they had three weeks. The universe was created in a third of that time. Andy replies, ""Well, someday, you'll have to tell us how you did it."" Steve threatens to call out every single member who helped create the Macintosh computer on stage itemizing each team member by their creation and tells Andy that he will call him out by name in front of the hundreds of reporters when he gets to the voice feature that didn't work.Steve returns to the stage to practice his speech. Woz is in the nearly empty audience. He tries to convince Steve to acknowledge the Apple II team during his speech but Steve refuses. They go outside and have a long debate, with Woz telling Steve that the Apple II accounts for the bulk of Apples profits but Steve is dismissive, only focused on the Macintosh and how excited everyone is after seeing the famous Super Bowl 1984 ad. Woz mentions that the Board hated it but Steve doesn't care about their opinion.Steve goes back in the room with Chrisann and Lisa. He asks why shes not in school and Lisa says that she woke up on time but forgot to set the alarm so her mom overslept. He asks why she should be in charge of setting the alarm but she says its just one of her chores. Chrisann attacks the Macintosh, asking how its going to change the world. He responds by telling her they donate many to underfunded schools. She asks how that answers her question. He sets Lisa up at the computer and tells her to use it however she wants, that she can click anywhere and it cant be broken. While Lisa plays on the computer, he raves about how the machine is the next big thing and will revolutionize how computers are used. He checks on Lisa's progress and then rotates the screen to Chrisann, revealing Lisa has used the MacPaint program to draw what she calls an abstract. He teaches her how to save the file she can already read the word Save, another sign that she is a gifted child. He has now warmed up to the little girl and tells Chrisann he will put enough money in her account to buy a house. She is skeptical but Joanna promises it will be so.Steve goes into the room with all the technicians working furiously to fix the voice feature. There is discussion about how Steve wanted only two ports a modem and a printer while the others pitched to him eight. Andy Hertzfeld suggests something possibly unethical the program worked fine on a 512K so they can do the demonstration on that instead of the unit they're showing (which is a 128K). Joanna comments that it is, in fact, quite unethical.The audience is now filled with people. They stomp their feet and start a wave. Backstage, moments before going on, John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), the former president of Pepsi and now CEO of Apple, chats with Steve Jobs behind the projection screen, telling him he heard hes behaving worse than usual that day, which he didn't know was possible. John voices that the Board was unhappy with the 1984 ad and Steve is argumentative, saying it looks like it should win an Academy Award for Best Short Film. John points out that it doesn't show the brand, its set in a dystopian future that the customers don't live in, that there were real-life skinheads in it. Steve argues that that's the look they wanted the characters to have but John counters that real skinheads are racists and they're now associated with their brand if anyone finds out. Debating aside, its obviously Steve and John have much love for each other; John Sculley refers to himself as a father figure for Steve. John then asks Steve why he can only focus on being rejected instead of chosen, pointing out that if someone is adopted, its not that their parents spent time with him and then gave him away its that a couple chose him and agreed to raise him. He doesn't give a solid response. He goes on stage as he is introduced but we don't hear his speech.Instead, through news footage, we hear that the Macintosh was a huge disappointment and it fell very short from Steve's projected one million in three-month projection. Instead it only sold 50,000 in that time period. Steve was subsequently fired by Apple.The movie skips forward to the year 1988. Steve has launched NeXT, computer workstations designed for educational use. Joanna and him are preparing for the launch. The product is a black cube and Steve is focused on the design he takes pride in that the machine is a perfect cube and is angry that some of the dimensions are off. Joanna mentions recent articles about his firing from Apple and how Steve Wozniak was the only one to give a no comment in relation to whether he was fired or not. John Sculley actually has said nice things about him in Forbes Magazine, which he finds a bit surprising.Lisa is backstage with Steve while he puts his foundation on, asking him all kinds of questions. She measures the NeXT with her ruler and says all the sides are the same. He tells her its a faulty ruler and she tells him if she had another ruler, she could measure that ruler but she doesn't. She says as long as four sides are equal, they're all equal but he says its a cube and it has six sides. He tells her the machine has to have the proper dimensions of cube but a few centimeters are skewed because the human eye don't see a perfect cube as such. They have playful banter, revealing they have grown closer over the last four years.Joanna has a discussion with Steve backstage and he is adamant about the cube being perfect, screaming at everyone. Someone suggests starting late while they perfect the model but Steve repeats that he never starts presentations late. Joanna tells him when he was at Apple, he made everyone uncomfortable and they had contests every year for the person who did the best job standing up to him. She won three years in a row. Joanna then tells him he has reality distortion and reveals that years ago, when he was upset about TIME Magazines cover, it wasn't a PC on the front but a sculpture of a computer. And he was never up for Man of the Year. This new information changes his perspective of things.Steve Wozniak comes to visit and mentions that Macworld Magazine has written up an interesting article about him. It states that Steve Jobs NeXT is so innovative, he may become Apples CEO. Steve and Woz go down to the orchestra pit. Steve Jobs says he once asked a conductor why his occupation exists, given he doesn't do anything a metronome can't do. The conductor told him musicians can play individual instruments but the conductor plays the orchestra. Steve is a bit condescending to Woz, which infuriates him. He points out that Steve isn't an engineer or a designer. Woz built the circuit board, the graphical interface was stolen, so why does he constantly have to hear that Steve Jobs is a genius? Steve tells him that he is the conductor; they are just the musicians. Woz stops him as he walks away, telling him he only stopped by to give him a warning the NeXT computer is going to flop and its going to be his second failure in four years. Steve tells him, ""Tell me something else I don't already know.""Joel Pforzheimer from GQ is there again. He asks Steve Jobs for a quote, on record, but Joanna gives him all the sound bites while Steve stays silent. Joel follows them into an elevator and Steve says the computer is just missing one thing but won't say what. Joel tells Steve hell keep whatever he says off the record, both turning off the tape recorder and removing the cassette to prove hes being genuine. Steve says the missing component is the OS (operating system). Joel asks how he is doing a launch for a computer without an operating system. Steve tells him they are using a demo which shows what it can potentially do but they haven't finished creating these things yet.John Sculley surprises Steve backstage, saying they need to bump up security. Steve thanks him for his positive Forbes quote but they later get into a heated conversation with Steve pointing out that he used the gentle Woz as a mouthpiece for the company in regards to his ousting. John asks why everyone thinks he fired Steve and complains that hes getting death threats from computer users. They argue with Steve saying the Macintosh would have sold if they had set the price point at $1,495 instead of $2,495 but John says its not the price; users were unimpressed with the machine. They continue fighting and John asks Steve, ""Why do you want everyone to dislike you?"" Steve replies, ""I don't want them to dislike me. I'm just indifferent to if they do."" John tells him that Steve will be happy to hear that he dislikes him and always has. Steve admits that he actually liked John.We learn who was really to blame for Steve's firing (according to the film). Through a flashback, we see John surprising Steve at his home which has no furniture he only has a Macintosh set up on the ground which he tinkers with when hes home. Sculley tells him the Board just decided they want to get rid of Steve. They argue, with Steve pointing out that John hated the famous 1984 ad; John says they had skinheads in it and they didn't show the product. He points out how his Pepsi ads showed the soda, people drinking it. Steve replies, ""Sorry to assume the consumer needs to be shown how to use the product."" He then accuses John of trying to keep the ad off the air but John tells him, ""it's the opposite; without him, it wouldn't have aired at all."" They had purchased various air time two 30-second spots and one 60-second spot but after viewing the ad, the network didn't want to air it and insisted they auction off their time. But he kept the 60-second spot and that's how the commercial aired. Steve demands a meeting with the Board.Next, we see Steve and John in a conference room with the Board on a rainy night, which Steve recalls was the worst night of his life. Steve points out to the Board that he was the one who founded Apple, in a garage; hes an inventor while they are hacks who just lead by a show of hands. He forces an ultimatum between keeping him, who he knows the Board already doesn't want, or keeping John. Of course, the Board votes for Steve to be ousted so Steve had forced the vote just to make John look like he was responsible for his departure.Steve goes to his dressing room where Chrisann is waiting, demanding more money because she has to go to the doctor for a sinus infection. But he points out that records show she spent $1,500 of the money he's given her to bless her house, which she could have used for things like the doctor. He is furious with her because he knows people who know people and they have reported that Chrisann threw a bowl at Lisa's head. Chrisann defends the report, saying that she didn't throw it at her head that she threw it at the ground and Lisa wasnt even in the room. It is revealed that she was angry at Lisa for forgetting to set her alarm clock, which he says is not something a child should have to do anyway.We learn that Lisa is now in a gifted school although Steve admits to having funded the school. Steve finds her on a catwalk, listening to a cassette on a Walkman. She says its two versions of the same old song. He asks her what the song is about and she says its in three parts first its about clouds, then love, and then life but in the second half, the singer begins to see these things in a new light. He knows the song, Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell and tells her its not an old song or else he'd be old. He tells her she needs to get to school because she's a truant and that's a crime. On the elevator down, he asks the difference between the two versions. She said the first is girlish and the other one she doesn't explain.Joanna pulls Steve backstage, frantic. He playfully asks, ""Why havent I ever slept with you?"" and she replies, ""Because we don't love each other."" She tells him that getting the cube the exact right shape means nothing because the product is not going to do well. He tells her he knows. Steve reveals that the Macworld article was right his goal was to show his innovation and ideas so Apple would take notice and he can be reinstated back in the company, as CEO.Chrisann and Lisa are leaving because Lisa now says she needs to get to school because she doesn't want to commit a crime. Steve tells her he was joking about that. He asks her what the second version of the song was, the first being girlish. Lisa tells him regretful but he tells her she shouldn't be regretful, shes just a child. She tells him that is what the second version is like, a word that seems fitting now that Steve is warming up to his daughter, who he once denounced as his own. She hugs him goodbye and whispers to him privately, ""I want to live with you.""Years go by and through real archival footage, we see that Apple falters in the 1990s with the one big gadget launch being The Newton, a PDA that turns whatever you write into computer text. It is mocked by the press and on The Simpsons and considered a failure.It is now 1998. Steve is getting ready to launch the new iMac. He runs through his presentation for the handful of people gathered in the audience. The iMac is revealed, beautiful for its transparency, bright color, side compartment for all the ports. Steve says that the video on the projection screen was the best hes ever seen. Andy Cunningham comes over and tells him its because shes dimmed the Exit signs for a true blackout. He asks how she managed that and she tells him she connected the light sources of the Exit signs to their system so they can turn them off for seven seconds. She hands Steve quotes on the iMac but Joanna confiscates them and says its best for him not to hear any buzz in advance. Steve knows his daughter is there and asks someone to grab her to come visit with him backstage. He is told Lisa is with her friends but he is insistent someone brings her to him.Joanna takes Steve backstage and she reveals that she has already reviewed the quotes and discloses what they say everyone is raving about the iMac and it is slated to sell a million units in three months. The statistics predict that 33% of the consumers will be people buying a personal computer for the first time and many PC users are slated to swap over to Mac. Steve says he already knows and jovially begins doing yoga. But Joanna changes the subject to something that makes her intensely upset she has found out that Steve has not paid for his daughters tuition at Harvard. He defends this decision stating that Lisa's mom has sold the house he bought for them. Joanna tells him that's not Lisa's fault but Steve says Lisa could have stopped her from doing so. Its later revealed that Chrisann sold the house at a fraction of its worth, the same thing she has done with sculptures she had previously bought at top dollar with the money Steve gave them. Joanna mentions that Chrisann needs money for doctor visits because she has a sinus infection. He tells her shes had the same sinus infection for 15 years.Joanna reveals that Andy has paid the first semesters $25,000 tuition. He asks which Andy and she tells him, Hertzfeld and she tells him he needs to start calling the other Andy Andrea. He tells her he could but its not what he calls them that matters; everybody else would have to call her Andrea for him to know who they were talking about. Andy Hertzfeld is outside the door, listening to the conversation as Steve gets upset that Andy paid for his own daughters tuition. Andy finally makes his presence known. Joanna leaves as Steve and Andy talk.Steve tells Andy that he will wire $25,000 into his account to reimburse him. Andy defends him paying for the tuition by explaining that word would let out that Steve Jobs daughter had to miss out on her first semester at Harvard because her dad refused to pay the money, and it would have made Apple look bad. Steve points out that the expenditure report lists Andy as having purchased other things for her Andy explains Lisa needed mittens because it gets cold in Cambridge. It is revealed that Steve is more concerned with something else his daughter has been seeing a therapist, at the encouragement of Andy, who seems to be closer to Lisa than Steve is. Andy explains that Lisa really enjoys the therapy, so what does it matter who suggested it? He also says that Lisa would like both of her parents to attend with her, revealing that Andy is in constant conversation with Lisa. Steve repeats what he had heard, that Andy suggested the therapist to Lisa to substitute for the lack of a strong male influence in her life. Andy admits its true.All through the theater, there are blown-up photos of innovators from the past like Bob Dylan, Lucille Ball, etc. Someone asks who is the man in a photo. Steve tells him that its Alan Turing who single-handedly ended World War II and invented the personal computer. When Steve is asked if hes going to include him in his speech, he says no because he just had to explain who he was. Someone mentions that Alan Turing killed himself by a poisoned apple and asks if that's where the Apple logo with a bite taken out of it comes from. Steve says it doesn't but it would be a good story.Steve goes back onstage to finish tinkering with his presentation. He finally approves the picture of a shark as the demo computers wallpaper. The technician is annoyed, stating its the same as the 37 other shark images that Steves been shown and it was probably one of the earlier ones he initially rejected. Steve runs through his speech, which utilizes Bob Dylan lyrics (who, in real life, Steve Jobs was fond of). Woz is in the nearly empty audience again, like in the 1984 presentation, and he asks Steve if hes going to acknowledge all the people hes just laid off. Steve defends his decision to downsize and refuses to add anyone into his speech. He explains this by stating that there are A-players and B-players in the company and theres no reason to include B-players in his speech. Woz is defiant, stating that they arent B-players, that the employees who design and build the machines are the reason the A-players can shine. Woz says he is sick of being treated like Ringo. Steve replies that everyone loves Ringo. He adds, ""But why penalize John for being John? He is who he is and Ringo is who he is."" Woz says, ""John Lennon is John Lennon because he wrote Ticket to Ride. I wrote the Apple code."" Woz says that people ask him all the time why Steve gets acknowledgement and he's always responded that Steve is a genius who invents and he prefers contributing from a hard workbench. But now he thinks Steve is simply an asshole. Steve defends himself by listing all of the improvements he's made to Apple since becoming CEO. Steve tells him ""It's not binary. You can be decent and gifted at the same time."" He exits.Backstage again, John Sculley sneaks into the area Joanna and Steve are clustered in. Joanna is quick to sneak John in as he was recently let go as Apple CEO and she doesn't want the press to notice him. He gives Steve a Newton, the gadget that Apple thought would be a big hit but was a flop. They have a cordial dialogue and Steve reminds John of how he said that as an adopted child, he should feel selected, not rejected. But in reality, he was rejected the Catholic lawyer who originally adopted him sent him back to the adoption agency after a month. His mother refused to sign the adoption papers when the less-educated Jobs wanted to adopt him which Steve comments as being flabbergasting, that someone selects him and they're still rejected. As they speak, we flashback to Steve in the early 80s trying to convince John, then president of Pepsi-Cola, to become CEO of Apple. He gets into an impassioned pitch about how the personal computer he's designing at Apple will be so inviting that everyone will have one, in the future. They are waited on by a nice Syrian waiter. John asks if Steve ever met his biological parents and Steve admits he did meet his biological mom. John asks if he ever wants to meet his dad and Steve says that they both have. We now see them again at the restaurant with the waiter he is Steve's father, whom Steve tracked down. John asks if he ever told the man he was his dad but Steve says no but he actually brags to customers that Steve Jobs comes into the restaurant. He fears revealing their relationship would end up in a law suit of his dad claiming some ownership of Apple. Steve is ushered away but he gives John one last note about the Newton before he leaves it was the stylus that kept it from being a hit. He tells him, ""Why use one unit when people already have five (he holds up his hand)?""(Perhaps this a hint at the iPhone, which will become a huge hit for Apple years later; the Newton was the first PDA in the industry and it was the touch screens that made the iPhone so popular).Outside, Steve is finally united with his daughter, who has been listening to music on her Walkman, just like in 1988. She is not happy to see her father. He tells her he's wiring money to Andy and is glad her tuition is being paid for her. But that's not what she is upset about Harvard has Internet access (i.e., its not as ubiquitous as it is today) and she was able to look up the TIME Magazine article from 1984 and knows Steve originally denied her as his daughter. She says that unknowingly, two of her professors have actually tried to reverse engineer the 28% statistic he listed (stemmed from there being only a 94.1% probability he is the father).Joanna tries to get Steve on stage as its time to begin his speech but he doesn't care about being late, counter to all the times hes been adamant they have to start right on time. Lisa continues to berate her father and for once, he is gentle and apologetic. She looks at a giant photo of Bob Dylan on the wall and tells him he might give a speech quoting Bob Dylan lyrics and the computer might have a fast processing speed but gesturing to a blown up picture of the blue iMac it still looks like Judy Jetsons Easy-Bake Oven. She storms off.In the final scene, Steve finds Lisa on the roof parking lot, walking towards her beat-up car, preparing to leave. He stops her in her tracks, asking her if she knows what Apples LISA computer stands for. She says, ""Yeah. I read the article. It's the Local Integrated System Architecture."" He points out those words don't even make sense together. That it was named after her. He always knew she was his daughter. He reveals the abstract picture that Lisa designed on MacPaint in 1984; he had saved it all these years. She is touched by this. Joanna finds them on the roof and tells him he needs to go onstage. Shelter from the Storm by Bob Dylan song begins to play on the films soundtrack, apparently from Lisa's Walkman. Steve eyes the portable cassette player stuffed into Joanna's pocket and tells her she shouldn't have to keep a giant machine on her to hear music. He's inventing a new gadget that will allow her to play 1,000 songs from one tiny gadget. Or maybe 500 songs. Between 500 and 1,000 songs. (Obviously this is the iPod, which will revolutionize Apple as a company). Joanna repeats that he's going to be late for his speech. But looking at his daughter lovingly, for once, Steve Jobs doesn't care."

Masterminds,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2461150/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A guard at an armored car company in the Southern U.S. organizes one of the biggest bank heists in American history.

Day in and day out he drives an armored vehicle, transporting millions of other people's money with no escape in sight. The only glimmer of excitement is his flirtatious work crush Kelly Campbell who soon lures him into the scheme of a lifetime. Along with a group of half-brained criminals led by Steve Chambers and an absurdly faulted heist plan, David manages the impossible and makes off with $17 million in cash...only problem is he foolishly hands the money over to this wild group of double crossers and has been set up to take the fall. With the bandits blowing the millions on lavish and ridiculous luxuries, they leave behind a glaring trail of evidence. Now on the lam and in over his head, David must dodge the authorities, evade a hilarious hit man, Mike McKinney, and try to turn the tables on the ones he trusted most.—Relativity Back in 1997, with the closest thing to adventure being an open spot at Loomis Fargo armoured car business, David Ghantt, a shy, quiet man in his forties, entered the world of thrill and excitement, following his dream. If only it were that simple. Instead, from now on, Ghantt's new reality includes a boring repetitiveness of collecting and delivering money, up until that day that Kelly Campbell, a new and exciting colleague, entered the company's door rocking David's world for good. Inevitably, head over heels for her, David is prepared to do anything for her attention, and before long, he would even accept a key role in an inside job proposed by Kelly and her opportunistic accomplice Steve, the town's petty thief. As one of the selected few who hold the key to the vault, David will be successful in his task and with the intention to please his new sweetheart, he will eagerly cram $17 million in the back of the company's armoured van, in the biggest cash heist in history. However, the security cameras are silently recording..—Nick Riganas A dim-witted armored-car driver is lured into taking part in a massive heist by a seductive co-worker and her criminal accomplice. But when his partners steal the money and betray him, he is forced to evade a police detective and an eccentric hit man while seeking his revenge.. 1997. Somewhat clueless about things in life in general, David Ghantt, a trusted armored car guard with Loomis Fargo, always imagined that his professional life would be full of adventure, the reason he went into the business, his expectation which has been far from the case. His life has the potential to reach that adventurous stage when he is approached by Kelly Campbell, a flirtatious former co-worker recently having quit/gotten fired, she who David can admit he is still attracted to despite being engaged to controlling Jandice Gartrell. Knowing about a recent inside job robbery at a similar security facility, one of Kelly's friends, Steve Chambers, gets Kelly to ask David to be the inside person in a robbery at David's Loomis Fargo facility, the secure area which houses millions of dollars to which he has access. To protect himself, Steve never identifies himself to David, and only uses with David the code name Geppetto as the one ""who pulls the strings"". To sweeten the offer, Kelly tells him that the two of them can start a new life together in Mexico with their share of the loot. Even if David is able to pull off the inside work for the job, he doesn't know two things: that while Steve will arrange for him to go to Mexico using fake identification, Kelly has no intention of going to Mexico with him, the talk still just part of her flirtatious nature; and also unknown to Kelly, Steve has no intention of cutting David in except for the few thousand dollar pocket change to get rid of him, David who can hang out to dry for all Steve cares as David has no idea who he is.—Huggo The film is based on a true story.Set in the year 1997, David Scott Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis) thought being an armored car driver would be a dream come true. He discovers that it's pretty boring stuff, and he often fantasizes about getting robbed. Everything changes when he meets Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig), a new employee at his bank, Loomis Fargo.David and Kelly hit it off at a shooting range where David accidentally shoots between his buttcheeks. He is in love with Kelly, but he is already engaged to Jandice (Kate McKinnon), a strange woman originally engaged to David's distant cousin before his death. David goes to an awkward engagement photo shoot.One day at work, David and Kelly's boss yells at the two of them to go back to work, so Kelly stands up for David. She argues that even if she gets fired, she can collect unemployment. She pushes it too far when she pretends to sexually harass David and grab his belt, causing his gun to go off and shoot a window. Now she's definitely fired. Before Kelly leaves, David asks for her number. She adds the numbers 143 to the end since it means ""I love you"" to her, and it's sort of like a signature.Kelly stays with her childhood friend Steve Chambers (Owen Wilson), his wife Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), their sons and two friends of Steve. After watching a news report on Phillip Johnson robbing from another Loomis Fargo bank, Steve concocts an idea to rob Loomis Fargo so they can escape their dead end lives and get away with some money. He persuades Kelly into getting in on the plan by getting David in on it since they know he likes Kelly.Kelly gets in contact with David to bring him onto the plan, with Steve hiding his face from David but also giving him instructions. Since he would rather follow her than get married to Jandice, David agrees to help. She then guides him through some ""training"", which includes eating a tarantula since he may be living off the land after the plan goes off.The team has David go inside the bank's vault and load as many bills as he can into the back of a truck. He nearly gets caught by another guard, but that man just assumes that David got overtime. Two hours later, David is done, and he breaks three cameras and steals two security tapes, but he misses one tape and another camera. He tries to close the backdoor but ends up locking himself in the back. He tapes some stacks of money together to drive the van through a door and into a ditch as the others watch. They are then amazed by how much money David has nabbed.The money is counted and comes out to $17 million. David flees to Mexico to wait for Steve to send him money and to also lay low, with a bunch of money stuffed in his underpants already. However, Special Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones) and her partner (Jon Daly) are already on the case, and Scanlon is pissed since the money stolen was federal agent money. They bring the security tape to Jandice and show her that David is guilty.After indulging in their share of the wealth, Steve thinks it's time to cut David loose since the FBI are after him, but Kelly thinks it would be wrong to screw David over now.Three Interpol agents arrive at the hotel where David is staying to look for him. They miss him as he tries to refill his ice bucket, but the concierge rats him out. David flees and manages to escape. He dons a disguise to evade capture and then calls Kelly to tell her what happened. He looks through his pocket and finds a wallet with Steve's name and face on it. When he drops Steve's name, Kelly and Steve become worried.Steve hires dim-witted hitman Mike McKinney (Jason Sudeikis) to kill David. He goes down to Mexico to buy a gun, but he buys a wooden display gun that even the seller says isn't worth anything. When Mike attempts to kill David in the streets, the gun backfires and blows up in his face. He then goes after David after instigating a chase (he likes it that way), which results in multiple car accidents.Scanlon goes around asking about David and how he can be found. Everyone tells her to go to Kelly. Scanlon and her partner talk to Kelly, who quietly breaks down when she realizes David is in trouble.Mike eventually gets David by knocking him unconscious. He gets ready to cut David up until he looks at his ID and sees that Steve used Mike's own name and information to give David a fake ID. Thinking David was born under the same circumstances as him, Mike gives up trying to kill David because he thinks they were brought together by fate, so they become buddies.David calls Steve and demands that he send him money within two days, or else he will turn himself into the authorities and name-drop Steve first.Kelly is at a clothing store when she is confronted by Jandice near the fitting rooms. She knows that Kelly was David's ""mistress"", and she attacks her. The two fight in front of everyone, with Kelly getting Jandice off by hitting her with a mannequin body. One of Steve's guys then follows Kelly.David calls back when he finds that Steve did not transfer money to his account. Steve then reveals that he has Kelly as a hostage, and he orders David to go to South America until he receives further instructions, or they will hurt Kelly.David is getting ready to leave from the airport, just as the same three Interpol agents are there looking for him. Mike is there too, because he is heading back to the States to kill Kelly under Steve's orders. When David finds out, he tells Mike who Kelly is, and Mike can't bring himself to kill David's woman. The agents show up and try to arrest David, but he and Mike beat them up. They trade plane tickets and say their farewells.Steve is holding a house party which David infiltrates to rescue Kelly. Scanlon gets one of Steve's neighbors (Ken Marino) to wear a wire to get a confession out of Steve. David breaks Kelly out of the shed where she is being held, and he steals Steve's BMW to make a getaway. Unfortunately, David's plan to burst out the gates backfires. Steve catches him and tries to beat him up, until David realizes he is near the police van with the detectives waiting for their confession. David tricks Steve into admitting that he was the mastermind of the whole plan, giving the detectives enough reason to arrest him.David and Kelly say goodbye just before they are hauled off to prison. Once David gets to prison, he is applauded by all the inmates for stealing the biggest amount of money in U.S. history. The story of the robbery becomes nationwide news, but it turns out that David stashed away $2 million in a barrel that he rolled into a lake. After serving seven years, Mike picks David up, and they head off to visit Kelly.The final text states that Steve Chambers served 11 years in prison, and he now owns a fitness center. David Ghantt served 11 years and he occasionally works as a film consultant. The Loomis Fargo robbery was one of the biggest heists of all time, and $2 million of the stolen money remains unaccounted for to this day."

When Frank's father (Ray Stevenson) pays him a visit in the south of France, their father-son bonding weekend takes a turn for the worse when Frank is engaged by a cunning femme-fatale, Anna (Loan Chabanol), and her three seductive sidekicks to orchestrate the bank heist of the century. Frank must use his covert expertise and knowledge of fast cars, fast driving and fast women to outrun a sinister Russian kingpin, and worse than that, he is thrust into a dangerous game of chess with a team of gorgeous women out for revenge. From the producers of LUCY and the TAKEN trilogy, THE TRANSPORTER REFUELED is a fresh personification of the iconic role of Frank Martin, that launches the high-octane franchise into the present-day and introduces it to the next generation of thrill-seekers.—Europacorp In the south of France, black Ops mercenary Frank Martin is leading a quiet life, living with his father. He gets illegally hired by 3 mysterious women who force him to be the getaway driver for them robbing a bank. Soon he finds the bank they hit was that of a powerful Russian Kingpin who has his father as hostage. Frank must figure out what is going on, clear his name and save his father. Former special-operations mercenary Frank Martin is living a less perilous lifestyle than he had previously, transporting classified packages for questionable people. Then he took the contract from Anna following his three rules of no names, no questions and no re-negotiations. According to the contract, he should be near the bank for her and her two packages. However, he finds himself thrust into danger again when Anna and her accomplices Gina, Maria, and Qiao orchestrate a bank robbery and kidnap Martin's father to confront and kill Arkady Karasov, a Russian mobster who had victimized Anna years earlier. Anna's whole team robbed Arkady's friends and framed him for it.. Balancing between the dangerous criminal underworld and the quiet life in glamorous French Riviera, Frank Martin, a former special-ops mercenary and now a professional freelance courier driver for hire, can transfer anything to anyone if the price is right. However, when mysterious femme fatale Anna commissions unsuspecting Frank to pick her and a couple of packages up in front of a bank, before long, the driver finds himself dragged in a white-knuckle conspiracy involving the hard-as-nails Russian gangster, Karasov. Now, it's up to Frank to put his unique set of skills to good use and save the day with his powerful 2012 Audi S8. But has anyone ever crossed paths with the murderous crime kingpin and came out smelling like roses?—Nick Riganas In the year 1995 somewhere in a French Rivera city on a typical evening, a group of teenage girls, prostitutes, are on the street, strolling for customers under the watchful eyes of their local black pimps. A van rolls up and a man gets out. One of the black pimps tells him to keep moving, as he's working. ""So am I"", the man says and opens fire with an assault rifle. The man, a Russian named Arkady Karasov (Radivoje Bukvic) and his partners, Yuri (Yuri Kolokolnikov) and Leo Imasova (Lenn Kudrjawizki) continue to fire on the men, killing them and causing their working girls to flee. Karasov sees one man survived and lets him live with a warning to his bosses that this territory is theirs now. Karasov whistles and a van of his ""girls"" complete with necklaces with the shape of a knife through the heart (to signify they're his ""property"") are made to stand on the same street where the murders took place. One of the girls Anna (Loan Chabanol) is visibly shaken by what has happened.Meanwhile, Karasov notices one of the previous French pimps working girls, Maissa (Noémie Lenoir) is still standing where her bosses just got murdered. Karasov asks her if she wants to work for him and she quickly says 'yes'. Charmed by her ability to get in line and know her place, Karasov offers her a ride with him (implying she will be a kept woman and will not be forced to have sex like the others) and she quickly gets into the car. Karasov then yells at the others to get to work. Anna stands on the street corner, tears in her eyes.15 YEARS LATERAnna is in a nice restaurant. She receives a call and tells the person on the other side of the line that the plan is in motion.A group of six local thugs in a parking garage spot a black Audi. They walk up to it, planning to steal it. Frank Martin (Ed Skrein) sees this and uses his phone to open the two front doors, knocking two of them to the ground. Seeing, Frank, the leader of the thugs tells him to hand over the keys. Frank says that's not going to happen. The six thugs attack Frank, and he makes short work of them using his martial arts training, and using their own weapons (knives, a taser) against them. He has the leader in a headlock when he looks at his watch. ""You're going to make me late,"" Frank says. ""I hate being late."" Frank knocks him out and drives away.Frank drives and looks at his watch, sighing. He's late.Frank picks up his father, Martin Sr. (Ray Stevenson). Martin Sr. tells his son that he late. Frank says he is only 30 seconds late, but his father counters late is late regardless of the time. As they drive off, Frank asks his dad about his retirement and Martin Sr. says he will now get 791 Euros a month in retirement money. Frank gets a call with an unlisted number. His father asks if he is going to answer it. Frank shakes his head no. ""I don't use the phone when I'm driving,"" he says.Meanwhile, a Chinese woman, named Qiao (Wenxia Yu), is in a hotel room with two men, waiting for Anna. One of the men, the accountant of Karasov's money, is angry that Anna is late since he is the one that pays them. Anna finally arrives and the man says they should get the party started.""My sentiments exactly,"" Anna replies before pulling a silenced pistol out her bag and shooting the accountant and his guard in the head. Anna and Qiao get to work, setting up a line of towels that lead out of the bathroom to the bodies. Anna then adds in the body of a dead independent prostitute to fake Qiao's death, making sure to add Karasov's necklace to the body. They use lighter fluid and a dryer in running water to cause a fire and burn all three bodies past recognition.Frank and his father have dinner at his house. Frank asks what he has planned for the future. Martin Sr. he plans to buy a boat with the money he has saved up. Frank dryly comments on that despite his father working in ""water purification"" he always worked in dangerous locations implying that Martin Sr. used that as a cover to be a soldier/spy. Frank gets a call from the same unlisted number. Anna asks if he is willing to do a job. Frank says he doesn't take contracts over the phone and asks to meet. Anna says okay and sets a meet for 2:00 pm the next day.Meanwhile, Karasov is on his yacht, surrounded by women and his two partners, Yuri and Imasova. Maissa is still there, as Karasov's loyal de facto girlfriend/kept woman. Maissa gets a call and hands it to Karasov. There has been an ""accident"" involving the accountant.Karasov and Maissa meet with Inspector Bectaoui (Samir Guesmi) who shows him the corpses of the three bodies, saying the first two have been identified. Karasov asks why he wasted him time showing them then. Bectaoui then shows him the third body, of a woman and asks if he recognizes one of his ""hostesses."" Karasov insists he is a legitimate businessman but Bectaoui counters he is not accusing him of anything and it would be a moot point to do so since many on the force have enjoyed the company of his hostesses. Karasov makes it clear that if he does try to accuse him, he better have an army with him.Frank meets with Anna at a local restaurant and lays out his three rules: there will be no names mentioned between them (at least not real names), the deal cannot be changed once it's agreed on, and he is not to know what he is transporting. All of the rules are so he can maintain plausible deniability in case things go wrong. Anna says he will be picking up one passenger (herself) and transporting two packages for a total of 104 kilos to their destination from the Mediterranean Bank in three hours. Frank agrees to the terms, and says one minute after 5:00 pm he leaves, with or without her. Frank leaves to get ready. Anna calls someone on her phone, telling them they are good to go.Meanwhile, Martin Sr. is at the store, buying an expensive bottle of wine.Frank is at a local mechanic shop, working on his car to get it ready. He calls his dad and tells him he will have to miss dinner since some things came up. Martin Sr. sees a pretty woman needing to change a flat tire, and tells his son he will just have to share dinner with someone else. Frank says that sounds good and hangs up. Martin Sr. goes up to the woman and offers to help her change the tire. When he is distracted, she pulls out a stun gun and knocks him unconscious, stuffing him in the trunk. The woman is Gina (Gabriella Wright), Anna's third and final conspirator in her plot.At 5:00 pm, Frank is waiting outside the bank. Anna appears in a blue dress and a blonde wig. Frank asks where the two packages are. Anna says they will be there in a minute. Frank counts down the seconds. As he does, two other women, a Slav named Maria (Tatiana Pajkovic) and Qiao in a similar disguise as Anna, get into the car. Frank asks what is going on and Anna explains that Maria and Qiao are her packages and weigh exactly what she told him. Frank wants to bail, thinking she is changing the deal, when Maria pulls out a gun and puts it to his head. Frank is less than scared, saying that isn't the first time a gun has been put to his head. Maria replies it will be the first time someone fires it though. Needing him to move (since nearby police are getting suspicious) Anna shows him a cell phone video of his father, who they have kidnapped in order to ensure his cooperation. Frank having no other choice revs the engine and drives away from the bank with the police in fast pursuit. Despite throwing numerous police cars and motorcycle officers his way, Frank is able to evade them all, putting most of them out of commission via car crashes due to precise turns and movements. He takes the three to a parking garage where they switch cars. Anna asks why they are leaving evidence behind but Frank says they are not, and pushes a button, blowing up the car and every trace they were in it.Karasov meets with the bank manager who shows him the video footage of Anna and her conspirators taking him hostage. However, they only broke into the safety deposit box of Karasov's accountant which had jewels, some money, and a little black book ledger. Karasov vows to find out who is responsible and make them pay. Maissa says she will do an ""inventory"" of their girls and see if anyone is missing, in case this is an inside job.Frank drives the three women back to their safe house, where he sees his father handcuffed and calmly drinking a beer. Anna wants to talk about a new deal, but Frank will have none of it. He just wants his father back and to leave. However, Anna tells him that his father has been poisoned and will die within 12 hours if he is not given an antidote, which only they have. Frank can kill them, but if he does, he kills his father too. Frank seethes in anger but has no choice but to go along with the next step of their plan.Meanwhile, Karasov meets with Maissa who has lined up all the girls Karasov currently owns. She says four are missing. Since Karasov believes one of the girls was killed in the hotel fire, he believes three of his girls are doing this to him.Back at the safe house, Frank notices Anna's necklace and recognizing it, quickly realizes that the plan Anna and her friends are trying to accomplish isn't just about the money; it is personal revenge against Karasov, the man they hold responsible for ruining their lives.Frank drives Anna to a hospital. Frank asks why they are here. Anna asks if he has ever played doctor. Frank, with a stolen white jacket, poses as a doctor with Anna in a wheelchair as a patient. He calls an office and poses as 'Dr. Smith', coming for some gases necessary for surgery. When they get to the office, they knock out the guy at the desk and steal a tank of gas.Meanwhile at the safe house, Martin Sr. watches a soccer game with Gina, drinking vodka. They talk about her home country and Martin Sr. impresses her a bit with his knowledge of it. She leans in to kiss him, having been seduced a bit by him, only to be interrupted by Qiao who tells her they got the gas, so the next stage of their plan can begin.Maria walks up to a local gang and asks if they speak English and are willing to make one thousand Euros each. The men all quickly agree and follow her.Yuri is at his plane, where he lives all the time. He wants to leave but they don't have clearance. Yuri tells his guard he wants the pilot to leave the second they can.Maria goes to a hotel bar and picks up a man and takes him back to his room. As soon as she gets him inside, she pulls out a gun and tells him to sit down.Frank drives Anna to a club that Imasova owns. Gina and Qiao are already there, once again in their blue dresses and blonde wigs to avoid identification. Frank parks around back (after knocking out a guard) and tells them he will replace the tank. After they do what they need to do, they will meet back at the car.Anna, Gina, and Qiao go into the club and dance with some of the guys as well as each other to kill time.Frank finds the fog machine system and switches out one of the tanks for the gas. He then texts Anna that the tank is ready so she and her two friends race to the bathroom and put on gas masks they had hidden there earlier. Meanwhile, when caught messing with the tanks, Frank is forced to knock out a club employee. When he drags him into a break room he accidentally locks the door. Turning around, he is surprised to see three other men there. Frank tries to make up a story of the guy being sick but they don't buy it. Frank notes they probably wont just give him the key to open the door. The men stand up and begin to fight Frank.Back in the main club area, the DJ hits the fog machine button and it pumps the gas into the building, knocking out Imasova and everyone else. Anna, Gina and Qiao walk through the club and get to his office and copy his fingerprints with a scanner. They are now able to access his bank accounts. Using the ledger, the find the right code and log in.Frank is still battling the men in the break room and a fourth man joins the fray. He uses a vacuum cord to twist and subdue some of the men into positions where he can hit them. Trapped in a narrow hallway, Frank uses the shelving units to beat and incapacitate the men. Moving back into the main room, Frank fights the four with pipes, knocking them out.Back in Imasova's office, Anna transfers 100 million of his money into her account. The three get back to the car but Frank isn't there. Anna calls Frank who is still busy with the goons. Taking the call and realizing he has to leave, Frank ties a vacuum cord around the leg of one man who tries to still fight him and string him up over the rafters. He then holds that man in place by looping the other end of the cord around the neck of a second man. He pockets the key and leaves, but not before telling them they should have just given him the key in the first place.Frank finally meets them at the car, only to see four more men have arrived outside to stop them. Frank and the three girls get inside the car. Frank opens the sun roof and puts the car into neutral. He tells them no matter what, not to touch a thing in the car until he gets back. Frank steps outside and begins to systemically beat every man that comes out trying to stop him. Despite that, Qiao and Gina freak out about the car still moving towards a locked gate and want to stop it. Anna says they will listen and wait for Frank. Frank eventually knocks out the last guy, climbs back through the sun roof and floors the car through the gate, making their escape. ""We're late,"" Frank says. ""My dad hates when I'm late.""The next morning, Yuri learns he can finally take off in his plane. A pilot and a stewardess arrive. It is Martin Sr. and Maria. Yuri wants to know what happened to his pilot and Martin Sr. says that he got food poisoning from bad oysters. Yuri calls the pilot, who is being held hostage by the gang that Maria recruited. The pilot vouches for Martin Sr., which calms Yuri. Martin Sr. gets ready to take off while Maria, under Yuri's request, pours some champagne. However, she laces it with a drug to knock him out. Yuri tells his guard to retire to the back room, and asks Maria to keep him company as he takes a sip.Yuri passes out due to the drugs. Maria locks the room where Yuri's guard is. She takes Yuri's fingerprints via scanner, so the group can access his money too. She then calls the gang in the pilot's hotel room to let him go and gives them the combination to the safe, which has their payment.As Martin Sr. pretends to take off, Maria comes in and tells him ""its done."" The co-pilot realizes something is wrong so Martin Sr. knocks him out and they proceed to flee. However the co-pilot slumps over the controls and accidentally causes the plane to accelerate to the shock of the control tower that can no longer get in contact with him. Martin Sr. and Maria go down to the emergency exit hatch of the plane, but at the speed the plane is moving at, they cannot escape without getting themselves killed in the process. He calls his son, who is nearby with the other girls in the car. As police units converge on the plane, and Yuri's guard breaks through his locked door, Frank drives under the hatch and times it with his father for him and Maria to jump. Just as they are about to jump though, Maria is shot by Yuri's guard, and Martin Sr. must return fire. The two are still able to jump into the car safely and the six drive off, with two cop cars in pursuit.Meanwhile, Yuri comes to, and is able to get to the control and stop the plane before he drives off the runway.Back in the car, Frank is looking for a mode of escape. He sees a ramp that is used for passengers and sees that at a certain moment it will line up with a tunnel that leads right back to the terminal. Timing his jump perfectly, Frank drives the car up the ramp back into the tunnel, racing the car through the terminal and out the front entrance, escaping.Karasov is in bed with Maissa looking at an old military photo. He sees Frank. Apparently they served together. He gets a text from Imasova saying he has been robbed.Back at the safe house, the five pull the wounded Maria out of the car. Frank wants nothing to do with it, saying he just wants the antidote for his father. Anna reveals they lied, there was no poison. Frank wants to leave, but his father wants to save Maria and together the five improvise to get the bullet out of her and close up the wound until they can properly patch her up. Martin Sr. pulls out the bullet and with a combination of sugar and cobwebs they close up the wound for the time being.Karasov meets with Imasova at the nightclub who explains that he and all his customers were knocked out by gas and his money is gone. Imasova shows him security footage of Frank fighting his men, and Karasov confirms for himself that Frank is responsible in part for his recent misfortune. Imasova is angry, thinking that Karasov is trying to double cross him, but Karasov denies it. He asks for six hours to bring those responsible to justice.At the safe house, Frank watches as his father has some fun with Gina and Qiao. He goes into another room and douses his busted hands in ice water to dull the pain. Anna comes in and apologizes for what she has put him and his father through and wants to make it up to him. She disrobes and they kiss and have sex.Later in bed, Anna tells him that no matter what happens she will finish what she has started. Frank asks when she was forced into prostitution and Anna tells him at age 12. As an increasingly horrified Frank listens to her story, Anna explains she grew up in an impoverished town with few opportunities. She had just come home from working at a factory when she saw her mother talking with a handsome man in a nice suit. The man was Karasov. He told Anna that she could work for him. Her mother told her it was okay and Anna went with him. It wasn't until it was too late that Anna realized that her own mother sold her for 500 dollars. Because of her family betrayal, and Karasov ruining not only her life but countless others, Anna will not stop her plan to collapse his entire empire. ""Do you know what it feels like to be considered trash?"" Anna asks Frank. Frank gets dressed and gets his father who is in the bed with Gina and Qiao. ""Time to go Dad,"" Frank says. ""Really?"" Martin Sr. replies with a hint of whine in his voice. Martin Sr. goes with his son, telling the girls goodbye.As they drive off, Martin Sr. and Frank discuss the various dark things they have seen in their lives and relate it to what Anna and her friends have experienced. ""Being sold into prostitution, where death is the only option out is pretty dark,"" Martin Sr. notes, feeling great sympathy for them. Martin Sr. asks what his son is going to do. Frank tells him he is going to drop him off, then go to Paris for a while until the heat dies down. He wants to forget any of them existed. Martin Sr. chastises him for running away from people that need help, saying that is not the son he raised. Frank then says he spent years trying to do the right thing and in the end it got him nothing (implying his time in the service was marred by being forced out by corrupt influences). ""It doesnt mean you stop doing the right thing,"" Martin Sr. says.Frank drops his father off at the consulate. ""Send me a post card from Paris,"" Martin Sr. says, disappointed in his son. Frank drives off. A moment later he gets a call from his father. But it is actually Karasov who has kidnapped him. He tells Frank that he knows he has access to the girls that stole from him and he is to deliver them to Karasov if he wants to see his father alive again.Frank returns to Anna's safe house and explains the situation as she, Maria and Qiao burn all their equipment. Frank notices Gina missing, and Anna says she went back to her family. They always made the crimes always look like three people were committing them so in case things went bad, one of them would be able to escape. Anna says they will help him save his father.Frank and the girls drive to Karasov's location. They are taken to his boat via a speedboat. When he sees Frank, Karasov mocks him, saying it wasn't his fault the rest of their squad wanted to make some money on the side. If he had just played along, nothing would have happened (implying Frank was forced out of the army due to trying to implicate Karasov in corruption). Frank says he went to serve, not make money. Frank says he brought the thieves and asks for his father. Martin Sr. is brought into the room. Suddenly, Yuri and Imasova arrive with their guards. Karasov asks what they are doing on his boat. They tell him he texted them to have a meeting. Besides, they are suspicious of him already. They want to know what happened to their money.Meanwhile, someone in scuba gear dives under the boat and gets inside to the electrical mainframe. It is revealed to be Gina. She never left. Shes integral to the final phase of the plan.Anna then tells Yuri and Imasova that they were ordered by Karasov to steal their money and his show of finding them was just a means to tie up loose ends. Karasov tells her to shut up but his two partners and their guards pull guns and allow her to keep talking. Karasov tells the two he is going to put his gun down and show them his bank accounts, and prove his innocence. As he logs in, Gina supersedes him, and transfers the 200 million they stole into his account. When Yuri and Imasova see that, their suspicions are confirmed. The standoff boils over and breaks into a huge gunfight that leaves Yuri, Imasova, and many of their guards dead. Unfortunately, Maria and Qiao are also killed as well. With no gun, Frank is forced to use a fire extinguisher to blind the remaining gunmen so he, his father, and Anna can escape. As they charge out however, Karasov grabs Anna and drags her away. Meanwhile, Maissa discovers someone hacked the boat and goes down to investigate.Gina, still down in the controls, transfers all the money, all 320 million dollars back to Anna, wiping Karasov out completely. Maissa finds her and shoots her in her back, pushing her out of the way. Maissa tries to log back into the system and recover the money but cannot. Seeing a piece of rope, Gina uses what is left of her strength and strangles Maissa to death. Martin Sr. finds Gina and begs her to hold on. Gina tells him she's sorry and dies in his arms, much to his sadness.Frank in the meantime gets into a fight with some of Karasov's men in a room filled with medieval weaponry. He takes a battle axes and trades blow with one man until it eventually breaks. Finally, he grabs an orange flotation donut and twists the two men through it, leaving them stranded.Karasov pushes Anna into a speedboat and takes off. Anna calls out to Frank as he is attacked on deck. Frank quickly dispatches the goon, throwing him overboard. Jumping off the boat, he lands on the back of a jet ski where a goon is already on it. Frank kicks him off and gives pursuit. Karasov gets to land and drags Anna into a SUV and knocks her out. As he is about to drive away, Frank drives the jet ski on to the sand and jumps off, kicking through the passenger side window and kicking Karasov out of the car. Karasov runs for the cliffs with Frank not far behind.Anna comes to in the car. She finds a gun and makes sure it is loaded.On the cliffs, Karasov and Frank fight. First just hand to hand. Then Karasov pulls out a knife and slashes Frank a few times. Then he picks up rocks trying to beat Frank to death. They trade blows until Karasov has the means to bash Franks head with a rock. Before he can though, Anna shows up and shoots him four times in the chest. His dead body falls from the cliff to the waters below. Anna screams out in a combination of relief, agony, and sadness, knowing that it is finally over.However, Frank knows that she is the one that called Yuri and Imasova. She made sure Martin Sr. was kidnapped, so Frank would have no choice but to deliver Anna and the others to Karasov and thus be there to save them all. Now, she has to kill him to erase any trace of what she has done. Anna breaking down, tells him to stop, to not get any closer. Frank then says if he needed to be dead, why did she save him? He gets closer to Anna and makes her put the gun down. Frank tells Anna that her friends died for her, and Anna says she would have done the same for them. Frank says that whatever she wanted out of all of this had better been worth it. Frank tells her to go before kissing her one last time. ""Is that the deal?"" Anna asks.
""That's the deal, Frank replies. Anna gets off the mountains and goes back to the car. She looks at Frank one last time, sadly, and then drives away.An undetermined time later, Martin Sr. is being interrogated by Inspector Bectaoui. Martin Sr. denies having anything to do with the mess and cannot identify the man who killed Karasov. Bectaoui has no choice but to release him, having no just cause to keep him locked up as a person of interest. Frank is waiting outside the police station, reading a paper detailing the death of Karasov and the dissolution of his criminal empire. Frank says they should go get dinner with a nice bottle of wine. Martin Sr. says that is the first smart thing he has said. They drive off.ONE MONTH LATERAnna, in a large mansion, free from her life of prostitution, sits at her pool with a tablet. Looking at her bank accounts, she begins to transfer money. She gives 75 million each to the families of Maria, Gina, and Qiao so they will never have to endure the horrors their daughters did. In addition she sends 10 million each to Frank and his father for their trouble, leaving the last 75 million for her, allowing Anna to have a life of peace."
Eddie the Eagle,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1083452/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Eddie Edwards, the notoriously tenacious British underdog ski jumper who charmed the world at the 1988 Winter Olympics. Eddie the Eagle is a feel-good story inspired by true events, about Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards (Taron Egerton), an unlikely but courageous British ski-jumper who never stopped believing in himself--even as an entire nation was counting him out. With the help of a rebellious and charismatic coach (Hugh Jackman), Eddie takes on the establishment and wins the hearts of sports fans around the world by making an improbable and historic showing at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. From producers of Kingsman: The Secret Service, Eddie the Eagle stars Taron Egerton as Eddie, the loveable underdog with a never say die attitude.—20th Century Fox In 1973, 10-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of Olympic glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favor of skiing in the Winter Games. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realizing he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him. A semi-fictional account of the rise to fame ofEddie 'The Eagle' Edwardsis told, he, since a young age, whose aspiration to be an Olympian far stronger than the odds against him in not being very athletic, not being very coordinated, being nearsighted, and not having the meaningful support, financial or otherwise, to achieve the goal, besides the emotional support of his mother who did not want to burst the dreams of a child. By 1987, at 22, he managed to teach himself an Olympic sport which he performed adequately, namely downhill skiing. Regardless, he is told by the British Olympic Committee that he would not only not make the 1988 British Olympic ski team, this the one and only year he would even have a shot in being prime age, but that he never would in just not having enough inherent talent as an athlete. In learning that the Brits are not and have not fielded a team since the 1920s and that under existing British Olympic Committee rules he would only need to have completed a sanctioned competition to qualify, Eddie decides instead to change sports to make it into the 1988 Winter Olympics despite never haven participated in the sport at all before: ski jumping, he traveling to Garmisch, Germany to learn how to do it. Added to the list of positives fighting the odds against is the needed attribute of fearlessness. Unlike the self teaching he has done before with skiing and other sports, Eddie quickly discovers that that will only take him so far in not even being able to jump the smaller Olympic hill, the 70m, without that help. He is able to secure a ""coach"" of sorts, Bronson Peary, despite Bronson not totally agreeing with Eddie's motives. Bronson is a black sheep like Eddie in being an American ex-jumper from the 1970s who fell out of favor with the sport's establishment, including his then coachWarren Sharp, Bronson now an alcoholic and piste driver at Garmisch, where no one except the all knowing Petra, a server at a local bar, knows his truth. But with every step forward Eddie and Bronson are able to take, they hit one wall after another, from the British Olympic Committee, other athletes, especially members of the British Olympic team and other ski jumpers, and his father, who only wants him to focus on a real life and not an unachievable pipe dream.—Huggo Cheltenham, U.K., 1973. More than anything, Eddie Edwards, a 10-year-old blue-collar weakling, wants to be an Olympian. And in 1987, at 22, Eddie finally gets a chance to make his ambitious dream come true when the plucky boy makes his way to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. By tackling the big jumps with the help of coachWarren Sharp's former U.S. ski-jumping champion Bronson Peary, Edwards becomes the first British ski jumper to compete in the games since the 1920s. Inexperienced, underfinanced, ill-equipped, and ill-prepared, the courageous underdog athlete enters the make-or-break 90-metre jump for the first time and writes history asEddie 'The Eagle' Edwards.—Nick Riganas Eddie the Eagle (Grint) is a very British hero, i.e., not very good, goofy and endearing. The film plots Eddie's entry as the only British ski jump competitor in the 1988 Calgary Olympics. Easily the worst competitor, Eddie becomes a fan favourite. His path to glory is strewn with anecdotal stories, slapstick moments and other antics.To paraphrase Eddie, ""I realised two years before the Olympics that I might be able to get to Calgary because no one else was going to apply and so started training. I got a lot of advice from Austrian and French ski-jumping coaches, but because I can't speak French or German, a lot of it went over my head.""A legend was born"
Room,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A little boy is held captive in a room with his mother since his birth, so he has never known the world outside. ROOM tells the extraordinary story of Jack, a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his loving and devoted mother. Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named ""Room."" Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within ""Room,"" and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.—A24 Five year old Jack's entire life consists of his Ma and whatever he has where they live, Room. Room is an approximate ten by ten by ten foot cubed structure, out of which he's never been. Seven years ago, Ma - Joy Newsome, the daughter of Bob and Nancy Newsome - was abducted by ""Old Nick"", the man who is keeping them captive in Room, which is really a tool shed in his back yard, the shed's only door secured by a number coded keypad, the code which only Old Nick knows. They are dependent on Old Nick for their basic necessities, such as food, water, clothes and utilities. Whenever Old Nick does stay for extended visits in Room, Ma will not let Jack see him or visa versa, Jack who is supposed to hide ""asleep"" in the wardrobe. Old Nick has no desire to see his biological offspring anyway. To shield him from anything that is happening to them, Ma has told Jack that the two of them and Old Nick are the only real things, and that what Jack reads about in books or sees on television are all not real. Jack believes that Old Nick gets their food by magic from television. The only exposure they have to natural light is a skylight at the top of Room, out of which they can only see sky. Joy knows she can't kill Old Nick because they would still be locked in Room. Joy tried to escape only once before Jack was born, that attempt which failed and which resulted in her not having tried again... until now. She has made this decision to try to escape partly due to Jack's age where he can now understand things better, and an incident which showed Joy what were to happen if something truly did happen to Old Nick with them locked inside. If they are able to escape, not only would Jack be required to adjust to a life and a world he may have no comprehension about, but Joy may find that the outside world is much more difficult to adjust to than she imagines, and not only because of the changes to outside in seven years.—Huggo Five-year-old Jack's whole world is a confined, 11-by-11-foot locked space crammed with pictures, toys, and books: the Room. Of course, his young mother, too, is in the room, taking care of her only son and making sure nothing happens to him--especially when Old Nick visits them, and Jack starts hearing creaking sounds. However, one day, Ma says there is a place outside their chamber where houses, trees, people, and dogs are real: a marvellous realm where the air is fresh, and the sky is blue. Is she telling the truth? Is there, indeed, a life beyond the Room?—Nick Riganas Jack (Tremblay) is a young boy of 5 years old who has lived all his life in one room. He believes everything within it are the only real things in the world. But what will happen when his Ma (Larson, in an Oscar-winning performance) suddenly tells him that there are other things outside of Room? Nominated for Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards and based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, who also wrote the screenplay adaptation. The film begins with a young boy with really long hair named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) telling us how he came into the possession of his mother, who we only know as Ma (Brie Larson) via TV people in outer space and him falling from Heaven. He wakes up and says hi to all the things in the tiny ramshackle room he shares with his mother: the chair, the cupboard, the inkblot on the carpet. Jack is excited because today is his fifth birthday. His mom tells him they're going to make him a birthday cake. They go throughout their normal day she leads him through yoga practice in their tiny bathroom. She gets him to exercise by telling him to touch this wall, no, I meant this wall. Ma notes a bad toothache.At night, Ma bakes the cake. Due to the limited resources, it ends up being very small and not impressive. Jack asks why there are no candles with fire. She tells him they can't get them. He is upset and refuses to eat the cake, telling her she could have asked for candles from Old Nick for their Sunday treat instead of jeans like last time. She says she gets things they need for Sunday treat. He says maybe he'll ask for candles for when he turns six next week. She tells him he turns six next year.It gets late and Jack goes into a tiny cupboard where he sleeps. Old Nick comes in and we see him briefly from Jack's point of view, through the slats. Nick asks about the cake and tells Ma if he knew the boy had a birthday, he would have brought a present. Ma's small bed begins to squeak as they have sex off screen. Jack merely counts higher and higher as this goes on.The next morning, Jack finds his mom in bed. They go throughout their normal day. She cuts apple slices and her bad tooth comes out. She gives it to Jack who keeps it in his mouth. He watches TV on a CRT television and talks of the TV people, which he thinks of are some form of aliens. Ma teaches Jack, educating him on various subjects. He takes a bath. Jack complains that his mom didn't tell Old Nick that it was his birthday and that Nick would have brought a present. Ma tells him he was lying. She makes him dinner, which is just a piece of toast. He asks if he can have something else to eat but she doesn't respond, irritated at her limited resources.The next morning, Jack wakes up and sees a brand new remote control race car for him. He plays with it all around the tiny room, much to Ma's annoyance. With the whirl of the race car making noise, Ma begins screaming up at the ceiling, which we see is lined with soundproof material. There are no windows in the room but only one skylight showing the blue sky above. Jack begins telling his mom about his pet dog, Lucky, and how he can't wait to be reunited with him. His mom tells him he invented Lucky in his head and that they have no dog. Jack sees a mouse in the kitchen and tries to befriend it but Ma scares him away. Jack is upset but Ma explains that the mouse could eat their food or bite them when they sleep. He tells her she didn't have to kill it and she says she didn't it went to the backyard with his family. Jack doesn't know what she means.That night, Ma is making cheese sandwiches. Jack asks what smells funny and she realizes she left the toaster oven on and it has caught fire. She is worried about this. She sends Jack to bed. He wonders, when he dreams, where he goes. She tells him he is always there, in that room. A padlock code is punched and Jack stays silent in his cupboard. Old Nick comes in with groceries. He asks about the smell and she tells him she burned the sandwiches she was making and she wasn't thinking. He tells her thinking was never one of her strong points. When she asks him about something missing from the bags, Old Nick gets violently angry with her and says its hard to have to provide for the both of them. He tells her he was laid off six months ago and asks if she knows how hard it is to buy things without an income. She asks if he's been looking for a job and he gets angry with her. In the cupboard, Jack stirs, watching the argument. Old Nick notices and asks if he's really asleep in there. He tries to prove he is awake by telling Jack to come out because he has candy but before Jack can take the bait, Ma lures Nick to the bed.Later that night, Jack sneaks out of his cupboard and tiptoes over to Ma's bed. Old Nick is still asleep next to her. Jack peers over to look at Nick, who then opens his eyes. He lunges for Jack but Ma wakes up and throws herself on top of Nick. He clobbers her, allowing Jack to escape. Nick storms off and Jack begins sobbing, telling his mom he knows he is not supposed to leave the cupboard and he will never do it again.The next morning, Jack wakes up in Ma's bed and notices he can see his breath. When Ma wakes up, he points this out to her, telling his mom he's a1 dragon. Ma realizes Nick has cut the power. They are in the dark and the heater is off so they are freezing. They bundle up in blankets.Ma sits Jack down and asks if he wants to know where the mouse went after he left the room. She tries to explain the mouse is outside, on the other side of the wall. Jack asks if she means outer space with the TV people. She says, no, that wasn't true. He was younger and so she made up a story that he'd understand but now he is five and should know the truth. She tries again, telling him there are two sides to everything. He says, Not an octagon. That has eight sides. She said but every wall has another side and on the other side are buildings and people and trees and a house with a hammock that she used to live in. That when she was 17, a man told her he had a sick dog to lure him into his custody. Jack interrupts, asking about the dog. She screams there was no dog. She tries to explain that there is a world outside the room that he's lived in his whole life but Jack cannot conceptualize this as he has never seen anything beyond that room. She explains that the TV people are images of real people. He asks if Dora (the Explorer) is real and she says, no, she is a cartoon. But people are real and they're all outside. He calls her a liar. She tells him the things she said before were a lie and now shes trying to tell an un-lie. He says he wishes he were four again. He suggests she tells him these things when he's six instead of five.After some time, the power is turned back on. A leaf falls on the skylight and Ma points this out. Jack doesn't believe it because leaves on TV are green but she sees they are green on trees but turn brown when they fall off and rot. Ma tells Jack she has a plan to get him out. She boils water on the stove and says she's going to convince Old Nick that he is sick. He will take him to a place called a hospital where there are people around. Jack is going to give a note to anybody he sees in the hospital and tell them his mommy's name (since she was sure to have been a high profile kidnap victim). Jack is nervous because he's never seen a real person before and doesn't quite know what to expect. He asks why they don't just hurt Old Nick and then escape. Ma said she tried once, years ago she took the toilet lid off and when he came inside, she tried to smash it over his head. But he caught her and hurt her wrist and that's why its been in bad shape his whole life. Its about time for Old Nick to come in so she pours the hot water on his face, which makes him scream but she tries to assuage him, telling him he must pretend to be sick and act floppy. She then forces herself to vomit and spreads it around Jack's pillow, which freaks him out. When Old Nick comes in, Ma pretends to be hysterical, explaining that Jack got sick when the power was turned off and they were left in the cold. Old Nick notes that Jack is burning up and says he'll get some antibiotics the next day. But Ma insists he takes Jack to an emergency room because it is urgent. He refuses.The next day, Ma says she has a new plan. Jack will pretend to be dead instead of floppy, he'll be stiff like a robot. She will roll him up in a rug and Old Nick will put Jack in the back of a truck. He will feel movement and unroll himself in the rug. There will be a long stop and that's when Jack has to jump out and run to the first person he sees, asking for help. She rolls him in the rug but too tightly so he can't unravel himself. She tries it again where he is more loosely wrapped and he is able to get himself out. Jack watches some TV and is now able to discern that the people he sees are real people being filmed although the cartoons are, in fact, not real. He is finally beginning to understand.They are discussing the plan with her repeating over and over that he will unravel, jump out when the truck stops, and then find help. She tells him to picture his moms voice giving him guidance even though they'll be apart. When he asks her if she will join him in the outside world, she agrees but it is obvious she doesn't believe she will survive once Old Nick realizes she has tricked him into letting Jack escape. Just then, they hear the padlock and Ma has to be quick to roll Jack up into the rug. She finishes just as Nick enters, telling her he has the antibiotics, but Ma begins crying, saying that he killed Jack when he turned the power off. She begs him to give Jack a proper burial in the woods, some place with trees. Nick agrees and picks Jack up in the rolled up rug.The rug is loaded into the back of Old Nick's pickup truck, just as they planned. He drives off to bury Jack in the woods. From inside the rug, Jack feels the truck slow to a stop. He begins to unravel and is successful at releasing himself from the rug. Old Nick rolls through two stop signs, then proceeds over railroad tracks. Jack decides then to stand up and jump out, looking for a person. Nick sees this happening in his mirror, says Stupid bitch in regards to Ma's tricking him, and stops the car. Simultaneously, Jack begins running towards a real person with a dog. But Nick grabs him and violently tries to return him to the vehicle. Jack is too scared to talk to the person but tries handing him the note as he is dragged away. The man is suspicious and tells him to leave the girl alone (he mistakes Jack as a girl because of his long hair) and that he is going to call the police. Old Nick abandons Jack and speeds off in the truck. Jack is now left alone with the man.Time has passed and Jack is greeted by a friendly police officer and her cranky partner. He is put into the back of the car and asked questions. The lady's partner theorizes the boy has probably escaped from some cult but the female officer is more patient with Jack. He shows her Ma's bad tooth that he keeps in his mouth and finally begins to talk. She asks what his mom's name is but he can't remember. She asks him where he lives but he tells her a room. She asks if the room has any windows and he says 'no'. She asks how they get light and he tells her there's a skylight. He remembers that it is called a shed. He explains that he was supposed to jump out when the truck stopped but it stopped two times and then went sideways. She tells her partner to put out a radio call to officers to look for sheds with a skylight in the backyards of houses three blocks from the railroad stop. She says a red pickup truck should be in the driveway.Time passes and the police car shows up in front of the house that we've seen when Old Nick loaded the rug into his truck. The officers leave Jack alone in the car and he can't open the door because it is a police car. Then suddenly Ma comes running around the corner, followed by officers. She rushes towards the car with Jack inside. She can't get in and Jack can't get out and she bangs on the glass.The next scene, Jack wakes up in a hospital room, which by his reckoning feels enormous with large windows overlooking a grander world he's been isolated from all this time. Ma wakes up and he tells her he wet the bed and he is sorry. She's not upset with him. She throws away his underwear and tells him they'll get more. They have a lot of food and he asks if it is for their Sunday treat and she tells him they're going to have lots of treats and not just on Sunday. He wants to take a bath but she tells them they have a shower stall. They shower and play and he admires the view of the city. He is overwhelmed at seeing more of the world than the room for the first time.Ma and Jack are treated and given many tests to take. The doctor comes in and suggests Jack wear a mask and sunscreen before he goes out since he hasn't built up immunity to the environment, but overall he's still young enough to likely develop normally. Regardless, Jack also has to endure being given vaccinations for the first time to acclimate him properly. It is mentioned that Ma will have surgery on her wrist that Nick damaged after she tried to harm him. Ma tells Jack that his grandma and grandpa are going to meet them. Grandpa now lives several hours away but he has flown in. The two (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) burst in the door, tired of waiting to be admitted, and embrace their long-lost kidnapped daughter.Jack and Ma are taken to her childhood home where Ma's mother now lives with her new husband. The media is camped outside the house but the family ignores them. Jack wants to know where the hammock is that Ma always talked about but she isn't sure; it must have been removed in the last seven years. Jack is told that his grandma's new husband has a dog but he keeps him in the country. Inside, there are tons of toys for Jack, which Ma explains are from all the people who care about him. He wants to know who these people are. Jack's grandmother asks if he wants to cut his hair but he whispers his response to Ma that his strength is in his hair.Ma notices her room is exactly as she left it. She goes through her old yearbook and shows Jack an old picture of her from high school with members of her track team, on which she ran anchor. She asks if he knows what happened to the other girls and Jack said he doesn't and she said, ""that's right because nothing happened to them.""At dinner, Jack is given ice cream and experiences his first brain freeze. Ma's mom and stepdad try to make conversation but Ma gets violently angry with her own father, demanding that he looks at his grandson but he can't because he is too uncomfortable (i.e., because Jack is the product of his daughter being raped by her abductor). She finally takes Jack upstairs.Ma and Jack have a hard time settling into life outside their captivity. Jack asks Ma when they are going to leave but she tells him they live there now. He is still wary of people and constantly hides in small spaces. Ma's stepdad is very friendly to him, which makes him a little more comfortable.The family's lawyer comes and tells them that there is going to be a trial and they will need money and the easiest way to get some is to do a prime time interview.A broadcast journalist shows up at the house. Ma is made up by the crew and prompted that if she feels uncomfortable with any questions, she can simply request they move on. The interview begins and the journalist tells Ma it must have been hard to maintain her faith in God after all those years in captivity and asks if she ever considered taking her own life. This derails Ma who doesn't answer. The journalist then asks what Ma will tell her son when he asks about his father one day. Ma responds that Nick was not her father to which the journalist inquires if there were other men. Ma explains, no, but he is not Jack's parent she is his only parent. The journalist doesn't acknowledge this response and instead says that he is his father, biologically speaking. She asks another invasive line of questioning: why didn't she have her captor take Jack away when he was born? The journalist suggests Jack could have been dropped off at a hospital and been able to live a normal life. She then suggests Ma only kept Jack imprisoned out of a selfish desire to not be alone.The interview has upset Ma and she sinks into a depression. She is aggressive with Jack and tries to force him to play with the toys he's been given by the sympathetic masses. Jack isn't interested so she forces him to play with Legos. Mas mother tries to defend Jack but Ma explodes on her mother, saying she seems to have been able to continue on with her life just fine in Ma's absence. Ma's mother encourages her to be nice but she said her mom's voice telling her to be nice is what ran through her head when a man approached her about a sick dog.Later, Jack hears some noises coming from the bathroom. He enters to find his mom unconscious on the floor. She has swallowed pills in a suicide attempt.Ma is taken away. Jack is left alone with just his grandma and her boyfriend. But he begins to get more acclimated with the world and feel more comfortable in their home. His grandma's husband even brings his dog home, which excites Jack, who still remembers his (imaginary) dog, Lucky.Ma calls Jack from the hospital. He doesn't know how to use a telephone but they have a short conversation.Jack tells Grandma that he wants her to cut his hair (which has never been cut in his whole life). She asks if he's sure and he says it is his strength but now he wants to send it to his mom so it can be her strength. His grandma tells him she used to cut his mom's hair and then cuts off his ponytail in a few snips which he is worried about, expecting it to hurt. She tells him she has wanted to cut his hair for a long time. He tells her, I love you, Grandma.Time goes by and a neighbor spies Jack through the window. Jack goes into the backyard and begins to play with him. It is revealed that Ma is watching from inside. She greets Jack and tells him that when he sent his hair, it made her happy and gave her a reason to come home. Ma and Jack play Legos together, their camaraderie from early in the film returning. Jack asks Ma if they are ever going to return to the room. She is taken aback by this and he tells her he means just for a visit.Ma and Jack return to the shed which now has the front door blasted off (how Ma was initially rescued). It looks completely different from his new perspective so Jack asks if its been shrunk. All of the furniture is gone which Ma explains is because the police took it for evidence to prove that they were there. Jack tells her its different with the door open. Ma asks him if she wants him to shut the door but he says, no.Just like when he said hello to everything in the room, Jack now says ""Bye, Chair #1. Bye, Chair #2. Bye, Cupboard."" He then tells Ma to say goodbye to Room. Privately, Ma mouths ""Bye, Room.""Ma and Jack walk away from the shed with police escorts in the distance, who have given the two the opportunity to say goodbye to their prison for their years of captivity."

At the funeral, her younger brother Todd (Stephen Root) and his wife (Wendi McLendon-Covey) try to persuade her to sell the house, especially the possessions, as she is a hoarder and has a habit of keeping discarded furniture and other items that she finds on the street. Her only close friend is the fiery Roz (Tyne Daly), though she also gets along with Roz's granddaughter. On her way to work, where she has been working as a data entry worker for decades, she meets a younger co-worker, John (Max Greenfield), whom she is immediately infatuated with. Empowered and inspired by cliched self-improvement tapes, Doris decides to go after him.Doris finds ways to get John's attention, though the attempts are frequently combined with daydream fantasies about a passionate love affair between them. With the help of Roz's granddaughter (Isabella Acres), she creates a fake social media profile in order to find information about him, and discovers that he loves an electropop band that is planning an upcoming concert in the area. Doris buys a CD for the band, which gets John's attention, and attends the concert, where she meets him and they spend time together. The band is intrigued by Doris and invite her backstage, where they spend a fun evening meeting young artists in the area. John tells her that he and his girlfriend recently broke up over text, and asks her about her love life. She reveals that she was engaged in the past, but when her fiance left for a job in Arizona, she had to decline in order to take care of her mother. When they part for the night, John gives her a friendly kiss goodnight, and Doris is in love.John is distracted for the next week, and Doris discovers that he has a girlfriend, named Brooklyn. Though Brooklyn is friendly and charming, and John likes her, Doris is devastated. She spends the night drinking wine, and in a drunken fit of anguish, she posts a comment on John's social media wall while using her fake profile, posing as a scorned young woman whom he had a torrid love affair with. The next morning, Todd arrives with her therapist, planning on decluttering Doris's house, but when his wife tries to throw out a pencil Doris stole from John, she angrily throws them out of her house.

He says that it was what worked out the best for his success, and she tells him that she could have had those opportunities, too.At work, Brooklyn arrives and has a fight with John before breaking up with him; Brooklyn tells Doris later that she had seen the comment on his wall and accused him of cheating on her, and she admits that she was cheated on in the past.

While trying to come onto him, she reveals that she's always liked him and that she was the one to put up the comment that drove him and Brooklyn apart. Upset, John rebuffs her, shocked that his friend would break him up with a girlfriend he was so fond of. When a flustered Doris asks him what he meant by asking her if she was interested in younger men, he admits he was trying to set her up with his uncle, who is a decade younger than Doris -- thus, a younger man. A hurt Doris leaves and invites Roz over for comfort.Doris invites her therapist over to declutter her house, and she succeeds getting it cleaned up. She also quits her job, and apologizes to John before she leaves. When Doris goes to the elevator, John calls her name, races out of his office, and tells her that he really is interested in her and wants to sincerely begin a relationship with her.

American Ultra,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3316948/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A stoner - who is in fact a government agent - is marked as a liability and targeted for extermination. But he's too well-trained and too high for them to handle. Small-town stoner Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) spends most of his time getting high and writing a graphic novel about a superhero monkey. What Mike doesn't know is that he was trained by the CIA to be a lethal killing machine. When the agency targets him for termination, his former handler activates his latent skills, turning the mild-mannered slacker into a deadly weapon. Now, the utterly surprised Mike must use his newfound abilities to save himself and his girlfriend from getting wasted by the failed test subjects that are sent after him by the CIA.—Mr.Moiz Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is in a holding cell, handcuffed and trembling. A man enters the room while another (Bill Pullman) watches them. Mike sees flashes of the last few days, as well as items such as a bloody spoon, a frying pan, and a shot-up teddy bear.Three days earlier:Mike was living peacefully in the small town of Liman, West Virginia with his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). He's a stoner-slacker and he is head-over-heels in love with Phoebe. Mike planned a surprise trip to Hawaii for the two of them where he hoped to propose to her, but they missed their flight because he was having a panic attack in the bathroom. Mike apologizes to Phoebe repeatedly but she forgives him. En route back they're stopped by the local sheriff, who knows Mike well. He welcomes them back to town in a kind of warning way.Mike returns to his dead-end job as a clerk at the local convenience store. Since business is slow, he kills time by drawing cartoons and rolling joints. Mike draws an ongoing cartoon about a simian astronaut named Apollo Ape.At the CIA Headquarters, Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) is going through classified files when her former assistant Petey Douglas (Tony Hale) enters. She then gets a phone call from a disguised voice saying ""Tough Guy"" is moving in on ""Wise Man"". She confronts another agent, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), as they both know this involves Mike and his association with a program that Victoria started, the Ultra Program. Yates wants Mike dead immediately, because he ""keeps trying to leave town,"" and orders Victoria to leave.Mike and Phoebe are sharing a joint at a spot overlooking a street where they see a bunch of cop cars and a tow truck taking a car that crashed into a tree. A very stoned Mike talks about how the tree has just been standing there forever and only just did something by stopping the car. He starts crying because he thinks he's the tree and Phoebe is the car. She comforts him and says that's not the case.The next day, Mike meets his buddy Rose (John Leguizamo) to get fireworks, as he wants to propose to Phoebe using them.Later that night at work, Victoria approaches Mike with a soup cup and a milk bottle, and she speaks in codes. He has no idea what she means, and she leaves frustrated. Mike goes outside to smoke a joint and eat the soup when he sees two guys putting something on the tires of his car. He calls to them, and they approach him with knives. Something in Mike goes off and he quickly reacts by throwing the hot soup in one guy's face before disarming both of them. He stabs the other guy in the neck with a spoon and then shoots both goons dead. Freaked out, he calls Phoebe at work. She rushes over and sees the dead men. They're then both arrested by the sheriff as he arrives on the scene.Yates gets wind of what happened and knows that the codes Victoria said to Mike were meant to activate his skills. He orders two of his own agents, Crane (Monique Ganderton) and Laugher (Walton Goggins) to find Mike and Phoebe at the station, as well as a whole lockdown of the town. Crane opens fire and kills the officers while Laugher goes to kill Mike himself. Mike and Phoebe fight him and lock him in the cell. They run into Crane, who shoots at them, but they escape. The sheriff slows Crane down by cuffing her ankle to a metal chair before she executes him. Mike and Phoebe run, but Crane calls to Mike and throws him a grenade. He catches it and throws it back, blowing up the station and spilling Crane to the ground. He nods to Phoebe and walks over to Crane, and squares off with her. She throws a punch, but he grabs her wrist and breaks it, then slams Crane in the head before breaking her neck.Mike and Phoebe head back to the store where Mike left his car. He freaks out again and they hug each other. The wind blows a bag onto Mike's car, setting off a bomb that the goons from earlier planted on the car.Yates is brought to a truck full of sleeper agents, including Laugher, who survived the explosion at the station. Yates decides to use him and a few others to go after Mike.The two take Phoebe's car to Rose's home where they can be protected. Rose is suspicious when he sees them because the news is making it seem like Mike contracted typhoid from Victoria, and that's why the town is on lockdown.Meanwhile, Victoria comes across the station and sees Crane's corpse sitting outside. She contacts Petey and asks for his help. He sends her a package containing guns and files on Crane and Laugher. Victoria realizes that Yates is using people with mental health problems as part of his program.Yates calls Petey and tells him he knows about the supply package, and threatens to have him killed for treason.Looking over the files, Victoria talks to Petey, who now says he can't help her because he's been told she is committing treason.A few sleeper agents sneak around Rose's home and spread a poisonous gas through the vents. Another agent breaks in and kills Rose and his two buddies while Mike and Phoebe are in the next room. Phoebe tries escaping through the ceiling but falls through as one agent attacks Mike. Mike is exposed to the gas but he rips the mask off the agent, which Phoebe takes. Mike bashes the agent's head in with a weight and slowly slips out of consciousness.Phoebe grabs Mike and takes him outside. She kills the agent that let the gas in and takes an antidote from him, then injects it into Mike. He feels sleepy but Phoebe warns him that he will die if he slips away. Mike then sees flashes of nothing but his time with Phoebe as she pleads with him to wake up. He pukes and is okay but asks Phoebe how she knew what the gas was. She then admits that she is CIA and has been his handler for the last five years. Betrayed, Mike retreats to her car. She runs there with him, and the car is then hit by Laugher, driving in a larger vehicle. The car falls over a bridge. Laugher grabs Phoebe and pours gas all over the car. Victoria shows up and gets Mike out before Laugher lights it up and makes the car explode. He takes Phoebe back to Yates.Victoria takes Mike somewhere safe and tells him that he volunteered at a young age for the Ultra program after getting in and out of trouble a number of times. He was the only successful volunteer, but the program was discontinued after it was discovered it was starting to drive Mike insane. She erased his memories and gave him phobias to prevent him from leaving home (the order to kill him was because he tried to leave town to go to Hawaii). They return to Mike's house where he says he would rather die stoned and smiling in bed. Victoria explains to Mike that Phoebe watched over him during his training and always believed in him. She was only supposed to stay long enough so that Mike was settled in Liman, then return to CIA headquarters for debriefing and go on to her next assignment, but she fell so deeply in love with Mike that she gave everything up to stay with him.Three more agents arrive and shoot at Mike. At the same time, Yates orders Petey to send out a drone to blow up Mike's home, even at the cost of some of his own agents. Victoria kills one using a teddy bear as a silencer. Mike kills another and then finishes the last by bouncing a bullet off a frying pan. Petey cancels the drone strike to spite Yates. He then calls Yates and Victoria's superior, Raymond Krueger (the man watching Mike at the beginning).Yates gets in touch with Mike, who arranges to get Phoebe back at a nearby supermarket. When Yates lets Phoebe talk to Mike to show she's alive and that Yates has her, she tells him that she was the tree all along, and he was the car. But Mike resolves to get her back.At the supermarket, Yates brings Phoebe with a team of assassins. Mike uses the fireworks as he makes his entrance, driving through the store. He takes on all the assassins, killing them with whatever he can get his hands on in the store (a meat cleaver and hammer, for instance). He is left to face Laugher while Yates takes Phoebe with him. She uncuffs herself with a paper clip and punches Yates in the face. He hits her back and yells at her about how Mike will be killed, but she just smiles and flips him off. Victoria then catches Yates and nearly strangles him to death with a cable until Krueger arrives and stops her. Mike almost finishes off Laugher until he slumps over and apologizes, saying he can't control what he does, and that Mike is a better agent than him. Mike lets Laugher go.Mike finds Phoebe and they walk outside together to face SWAT teams and other armed troopers. Mike takes this opportunity to propose to Phoebe. She says yes, but the moment is killed when both of them get tasered.Krueger takes both Yates and Victoria into the woods and reprimands them for letting all the deaths happen as a result of getting Mike activated, including seven civilians; a severe violation. Yates admits to acting without authorization, but insists he took initiative on a program already in place and that Krueger would be thanking him if it was a success. Krueger admits Yates is right about this, but then he shoots and kills him. A frightened Victoria begs for her life, but Krueger coldly tells her she needs to come up with a miracle. Victoria says she already has one: Mike killed 17 ""toughguy"" assets by himself, proving that Mike is a very valuable asset worth keeping alive.We return to the first scene where Krueger is watching Mike get debriefed.Six months later.Mike and Phoebe are in the Philippines on what appears to be a romantic getaway. Mike leaves Phoebe at the front desk, and she looks into a camera where Victoria and Petey are watching them. Mike gets into an elevator and is taken by two Mandarin gangsters, as planned by Victoria. The main gangster threatens and taunts Mike, but Mike observes what he can get his hands on in the room and he springs into action...As the closing credits begin, a montage of Apollo Ape animations show Mike wiping out all the gangsters and escaping the hotel with Phoebe, where they finally take that long-awaited Hawaiian getaway."

Burnt,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2503944/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Adam Jones is a chef who destroyed his career with drugs and diva behavior. He cleans up and returns to London, determined to redeem himself by spearheading a top restaurant that can gain three Michelin stars. Chef Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) had it all - and lost it. A two-star Michelin rockstar with the bad habits to match, the former enfant terrible of the Paris restaurant scene did everything different every time out, and only ever cared about the thrill of creating explosions of taste. To land his own kitchen and that third elusive Michelin star though, he'll need the best of the best on his side, including the beautiful Helene (Sienna Miller).—Polly_Kat Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper), a young chef who was once a rising star in the restaurant world, is recovering from a drug addiction that had decimated his promising career. After getting clean he heads to London to take the helm of a top restaurant and is determined to earn it three Michelin stars. Three years ago, Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) worked at one of the premier restaurants in Paris, France, which his mentor Jean-Luc owned. His drug use and manic drive for perfection caused him to implode, taking the restaurant and a number of his friends' careers with him. Adam disappeared, sobered up, and sentenced himself to shucking one million oysters at a bar in New Orleans. When Adam finishes shucking his millionth oyster he returns to London with a plan to regain his former glory and go for his third Michelin star.
After arriving in London, Adam begins to look up his old colleagues. Jean-Luc's former maître d'hôtel Tony (Daniel Brühl) now manages his father's hotel. Adam wants to take over the hotel's restaurant, but Tony doesn't trust him after his behavior in Paris. Frankly, he thought Adam had died, especially because he didn't show up for Jean-Luc's funeral. Adam had no idea Jean Luc died and feels deep remorse for how he hurt his mentor. Next Adam visits his friend Conti (Henry Goodman) at the restaurant Conti owns. He takes a liking to Conti's sous-chef Helene (Sienna Miller), but Helene finds him old-fashioned and unbearably conceited. Adam locates Michel (Omar Sy), another of his friends from Jean-Luc's. When Michel opened his own restaurant Adam felt deeply betrayed. He released rats in Michel's kitchen and reported him to a health inspector, which lead to the closure of the restaurant. Michel forgives Adam and agrees to work for him. Adam pays a visit to Reece's, a cutting edge eatery run by Reece (Matthew Rhys), with whom he has a long standing competition. Reece does not forgive him. Adam also plans to employ another Jean-Luc protege, Max (Riccardo Scamarcio), after he is released from prison. Unfortunately, Adams reappearance in Europe attracts the attention of his former drug dealer. Eventually, Tony kicks Adam out of his familys hotel, where hed been staying, so Adam seeks out chef-on-the-rise David (Sam Keeley). David agrees to work at Adam's restaurant and let Adam stay in his apartment.Adam contacts famed restaurant critic Simone (Uma Thurman) and asks her to dine at Tony's hotel. Tony flips out when he sees Simone. Adam appears in the kitchen and asks Tony for the opportunity to prove himself. Tony, having no other option, agrees. Simones review of Adam's food is favorable enough that Tony and his father agree to renovate their hotel's kitchen and hire Adam as the head chef. They do require Adam to submit to weekly drug tests with Tony's psychiatrist Dr. Rosshilde (Emma Thompson). Adam refuses her offer to see her privately. He throws himself into preparing for his restaurant Langham's grand opening. Max gets out of prison and joins Adam's team. Helene rebuffs further job offers until Conti gently fires her. He sends her to the hotel's kitchen, where Helene tears into Adam for getting her fired. Adam offers her a much higher salary and she agrees to work at Langham's. The opening night turns into such a disaster that Adam closes the restaurant early. He becomes furious with everyone, especially Helene. After humiliating her in front of her colleagues and becoming physically aggressive with her, Helene quits.Adam goes on talk shows to generate interest in the restaurant. He manages to bring another famous restaurant critic to eat at Langham's. The critic's favorable review cements Langham's as one of London's new go-to eateries and drives Reece into a frothing rage. Tony visits Helene to convince her to return to Langham's. He offers her more money and some insight on Adam's behavior: he grew up in an unhappy home and has always been volatile but brilliant. Helene agrees and Adam treats her with more respect. Their relationship continues to improve when Adam bakes a cake for Helene's daughter Lily (Lexie Benbow-Hart) on her birthday. Adam does not give Helene the day off, so Tony offers to watch her at the hotel, and Adam makes an effort to connect with Lily.Once Langham's has established itself, Tony and Adam prepare to earn a Michelin star. Adam continues to fend off his drug dealer's collectors and to see Dr. Rosshilde for drug tests. He remains impervious to her judgments about his sobriety and his perfectionism but, when asked, admits he knows Tony is in love with him.When Adam receives an invitation to the reopening of Reece's restaurant, he asks Helene to accompany him. Adam and Reece manage to be civil, but the night derails when Adam spots Jean-Luc's daughter Anne Marie (Alicia Vikander). Reece explains to Helene that they used to date. Adam is surprised when Anne Marie treats him kindly, especially since he abandoned her three years ago and didn't attend her father's funeral. Anne Marie has also gotten clean and sober and wants to give Adam her father's cooking knives. Helene finds him at a fish market next morning. Adam has wandered around the whole night thinking about what went wrong in Paris. Jean-Luc was more of a father figure to him than his own dad, and he defined himself by his prowess as a chef. He loved the volatile fast-paced environment of the kitchen and thrived there. Until, he didn't any more. He took drugs and eventually came unhinged. He now wants to achieve greatness and doesn't know how to handle failure.Adam and Helene share their first kiss in front of the restaurant that morning. Tony interrupts them, but he's not alone. The drug dealers henchmen have returned, and they want Adam to go with them. He hands the fish to Helene and leaves with them. Tony tells Helene not to worry because Adam can handle himself. That evening, Helene discovers a beaten Adam by the kitchen entrance. Tony and Helene want to take Adam to the hospital, but before they can do much more than clean him up, they learn that two Michelin judges have come to Langham's. Everyone rushes about in a frenzy, and Adam barely holds it together. They finish the judges' meals and minutes later, the waiter returns with two uneaten meals. The judges sent their food back because their soup was too spicy. Michel, who previously assured Adam that hed checked the soup, admits he poured too much cayenne into the soup. He has had his revenge for what Adam did to him in Paris. After Michel leaves, Adam falls apart and, despite Tony and Helene's protests, also runs out.Adam wanders around London. He climbs onto the railing of Westminster Bridge and seems to consider jumping. Later he shows up at Reece's restaurant and bangs on the windows until Reece lets him in. Adam is drunk and makes a nuisance of himself in the kitchen. When he pulls a small plastic bag over his head and begins weeping, Reece dismisses his kitchen staff and rips the bag off Adam's head. He cradles Adam when he falls to the floor, and he allows Adam to spend the night. The next morning, Reece says that he knows Adam's a better cook than him. He still appreciates Adam's work though because it pushes him to keep experimenting. They part on far better terms. Adam visits Dr. Rosshilde and attends his first group therapy session. When he returns to the hotel, he learns that Anne Marie has paid off the drug dealer. She also gives him her father's knives and urges him to be good to Helene. Tony and Helene find Adam with amazing news: the two men the night before were not Michelin judges, although they behaved exactly like them. Adam is thrilled to have another chance to get a Michelin star, but hes even happier to kiss Helene again. They begin to date.Adam changes the way he runs the kitchen. He listens to Helene and Max more, and he's more supportive of David. When the real Michelin judges come to Langham's, he works with the other chefs, especially Helene, to serve a superb meal. They receive their third star, and Tony and Adam celebrate."

A man named Jack enters a nice restaurant and spots his friend Therese (Rooney Mara) who is seated across from a pretty blonde woman (Cate Blanchett), who is introduced as Carol. Upon Jack's entrance, Carol excuses herself from the table, saying she has an event to attend to. She says her goodbye to Therese, squeezing her shoulder. Jack suggests Therese and he share a ride to their mutual friend's party. Therese agrees, sedately. In the cab, Therese sees Carol walking down the sidewalk and flashes back to a day months earlier, when Therese is working at a department store, wearing a red Santa hat, transfixed on something in the distance.In the flashback, it is New York City of December 1952, Therese is picked up at home by her boyfriend, Richard. She rides tandem on his bicycle to the Frankenberg Department Store where they both work. As they head to the floor, every employee is handed a Santa hat and told it's a gift from their employer. In the break room, Richard mentions an upcoming boat trip that he wants to take with Therese.Therese is revealed to work behind the counter of the toy department. Her no-nonsense supervisor chastises her for not wearing her complimentary Santa hat, which Therese puts on, now matching the flashback we had seen a few minutes earlier. Among the rowdy customers admiring a train set, Therese is fixated on the calm and radiating Carol. But a woman approaches her, distorting the view to ask where the restroom is. After Therese directs her, Carol has disappeared, much to Therese's disappointment. But suddenly, Carol is in front of her, asking for help finding a Betsy Wetsy doll. Therese is familiar with the doll, which wets itself but says they have sold out. Carol is disappointed, saying it's the doll her daughter wanted. Therese references the other dolls they have for sale. Carol begins to smoke a cigarette and Therese has to tell her that she can't smoke indoors. Carol is defensive, stating that she is just stressed out from the shopping and Therese politely sympathizes, telling her she feels the same way working there. Carol tells Therese she is kind and asks what doll she would have liked as a young girl. Therese tells her she didn't play with dolls but would have loved the train set that Carol must have seen as she entered, as it snakes around the store. Carol decides to take Therese's suggestion and Therese writes up a sales ticket. Carol walks away but turns and tells Therese she likes her (Santa) hat. Therese then notices Carol has left her gloves on the counter. She notes Carols home address on the sales ticket.That evening after work, Therese is in a bar with some guy friends. One of them gives her back her camera, which he has fixed for her. A new acquaintance tells her he works at New York Times and if she comes by sometime, he can show her around the photojournalist department.Meanwhile, Carol returns to her massive home in New Jersey. She brushes her three-year-old daughter's hair while they look in the mirror and is loving towards the girl. A woman named Aunt Abby is mentioned, the godmother of Carol's daughter. The following evening, Carol attends a dinner party where she dances with her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler) who tells her every time they go out, she's always the most beautiful girl in the room. But Carol is uncomfortable and doesn't want to be there. A friend finds her in the corner and invites Carol to her home for Christmas. At home, the gloves arrive, postmarked from Therese at the department store.The next day at the store, Therese checks with the human resources department to check the status of the train set being sent to Carol's home, saying she had promised it would arrive by Christmas Eve. She gets a confirmation that it has arrived on time. When Therese goes upstairs, her supervisor calls her over, frightening Therese. But it is a phone call from a customer - Carol, who thanks Therese for sending the gloves. To show her appreciation, Carol offers to take Therese out to dinner. Therese has to ask her supervisor for a pad and pen to write down the address, which irritates the supervisor even further.Carol is now driving in a convertible with Aunt Abby (Sarah Paulson), who inquires about the shop girl that Carol is meeting up with. Although she claims she is merely thanking someone who returned her gloves, Abby teases Carol, suspecting she is interested in her romantically. This is the first time we hear that the wife and mother is openly interested in women.Therese and Carol meet at the restaurant. Carol confidently orders creamed spinach as well as a dry martini with an olive. Overwhelmed, Therese simply orders the same thing. When the waiter asks if she means the entrée or the drink, Therese tells him ""All of it"". As they both light up and smoke cigarettes while waiting for their food to arrive, Carol asks Therese if she is living with someone. She tells her 'no', but her friend Richard wants to live with her. Carol seems disappointed so Therese interjects, ""It's not like that. He's just in love with me."" Carol tells Therese that she and her husband are divorcing. She suggests that Therese stop by her house in the country. Carol admires Therese, telling her she seems to have just sprung out of (outer) space.Therese now meets with her new friend at the New York Times building after hours. She is intrigued by the photo lab. He asks her what kind of photography she does and she tells him she takes shots of a lot of trees and buildings. He tells her she should photograph people but she has always been shy about taking pictures of people because it feels intrusive. He tries to kiss her but she stops him and walks out.Richard joins Therese as she waits for Carol to pick her up for their Sunday at Carol's house (the date is December 21, 1952). He asks if she is distant from him because he's had sex with two other girls in the past but says he only did it because they loved each other. She says it doesn't bother her because the two of them have never had sex. Carol arrives and Richard says ""Bye, I love you""... to which Therese doesn't respond. Carol and Therese drive through a long tunnel and seem giddy to be in each others company. Their first stop is a Christmas tree lot. As it begins to snow, Therese takes a photo of Carol while she is selecting a tree. Carol catches her in the act and Therese apologizes, telling her she has been encouraged to start photographing human subjects. Carol isn't upset though; she just says she'd prefer to be photographed when she is more done up.At her home, Carol and her daughter decorate the tree. Therese isolates herself at the piano and plays a tune. Carol comes over and asks Therese about her photography. She asks if Therese is talented, which Therese doesn't know. Carol tells her it's something she would have been told by others. Carol suggests visiting Therese's apartment to see her work. The two are having a great time but then Carol's husband, Harge, comes home to pick up their daughter. Carol objects defiantly, reminding him their daughter was supposed to spend Christmas Eve with her and then Christmas Day with his relatives in Florida. But he says they have a long drive and his parents demanded they leave early. Harge then spots Therese. She tells him they met at Frankenberg's and she invited her over to thank her for returning her gloves. Harge doesn't believe this and they step outside to argue. Inside, Therese can hear them yelling, with Harge accusing Carol of being in love with the shop girl in their home, lamenting that he thought she had recovered from her period of immorality. Inside, Therese turns up the stereo loud to drown out the discussion. When Carol returns inside, she is cold to Therese and tells her there is an 8:00 PM train back to New York and she should be taken to the station immediately to make it in time.Therese takes the train home, rejected and sad. When she gets to her place, the public phone in the hallway is ringing. She answers it and her neighbor comes out and tells her its too late for phone calls. Therese points out that coming home to a ringing phone isn't her fault. On the line, Carol apologizes for the abrupt exit and asks to come over to Therese's place to see her photographs. She also suggests they spend Christmas together as she'll be all alone. She is planning on taking a trip out west. Therese agrees.The next day, Harge returns with their daughter. She has been crying that she wants her mother to join them for Christmas so he is now adamant that Carol come along. He tries to get her to rethink the divorce but she refuses to join him, adamantly wanting to stay home. He asks her where else she is going to go at Christmas given she has no friends. She tells him she has lots of places she can go with Ed or Abby. At the mention of Abby's name, he accuses her of cheating on him with her. Carol explains Aunt Abby is their daughter's godmother and that their relationship was over long before it was over with him. Harge gets violent and upset that he didn't get his way. He reluctantly drives off without her, threatening Carol that she will be sorry. She realizes that if he can't have her, he will make sure no one else can.Carol shows up at Therese's apartment stating she needs a drink and hopes that her refrigerator contains more than just film canisters. Carol looks at the pictures on Therese's wall including the recent one of her at the Christmas tree lot. Therese is humble, saying she would do a better job in better circumstances. But Carol is impressed with her work, telling her the pictures are perfect as they are.Another day or two later, Richard and Therese walk through the city and he asks why she's been so distant. She explains that they don't have chemistry and that when two people connect, it is undeniable. She explains that who you fall in love with is out of your control it could even be two men and asks if he's ever been in love with a boy. He scoffs at the notion and says of course not. He then inquires if she's in love with a girl. She denies this.Carol meets with her lawyer who suggests she sits down. She laughs at this, wondering why people always think sitting down will help lessen the blow of bad news. Her lawyer tells her that Harge has suggested Carol has broken a morality clause and therefore he will get sole custody of their daughter. She knows this refers to her homosexual relationships. Carol goes outside to smoke and notices an expensive camera in a window display.Meanwhile, Therese goes to a record shop and is very specific in finding a certain album. As she purchases it, two lesbians ogle her from afar. She ignores them.At home, Therese is packing up while Richard lambasts her for quitting her job and leaving for a long period of time. She tells him her last month for the rent is paid because she had extra money in her savings he points out she has that surplus because she was putting it aside for their boat trip. He chastises her for having a schoolgirl crush on this older woman and that she'll regret leaving him when she sees him with another girl. She ignores this and tells him she's having her mail forwarded to Chicago so he doesn't need to check it.Carol and Therese set out on their cross-country trip. They stop at a motel. While Carol takes a shower, Therese looks through her suitcase, smelling her sweater. She stops short when she sees a gun hidden among her clothes. When they get back in the car, Therese asks Carol if she believes she's in danger. Carol replies in the negative.Back in New Jersey, Harge arrives at Abby's door, asking for Carol and saying he will drop the charges if she stays with him. Abby tells him Carol isn't there and he shouldn't be so presumptuous. Harge doesn't believe this because Carol has no other friends and then realizes Carol must be with the shop girl.Carol and Therese stop by a restaurant, vacant because everyone is at home for the holidays. Therese gives her present to Carol - the album she purchased, which includes the song Therese played at the piano in Carol's home. Carol then gives Therese a present - the expensive camera.The two drive on and check into another motel in a small Ohio town. In their hotel, the woman at the desk tells them they can upgrade to the presidential suite at an attractive price. Carol tells the woman two standard rooms are fine but Therese interjects, pointing out its an attractive price. Inside, Carol puts makeup on Therese.They plan to open a bottle of champagne but Therese goes outside to get some ice. In the parking lot, Therese finds the ice bucket. A goofy man approaches and offers to help her, mentioning how the cold weather tends to fog up his glasses. She is polite to him but obviously finds him weird. Inside the motel room, Therese takes photos as she lovingly watches Carol sleep.The next morning, Therese is seated at a table at a nearby diner with her morning coffee. The dorky man from the night before joins her where he introduces himself as Tommy Tucker. She tells him the coffee is horrible but he says ""As long as it's hot..."". Carol then joins them with a map, telling Therese she thinks the coffee is lousy. Tommy tries to ignite a conversation but Carol just responds by smiling at him, silently. When Therese mentions they are headed to Chicago, he tells them he is, too, and suggests taking a shortcut through the interstate to save two hours. Therese thanks him for the tip. Carol responds with an indifferent smile.Later that day, Carol and Therese arrive in Chicago. Therese checks her mail at the nearby post office she has had her letters forwarded to. Carol sneaks into a phone booth and calls her home to hear her daughter's voice but she hangs up without speaking when Harge answers. Carol reunites with Therese who asks if she had made a phone call, coming from the direction of the phone booths. Carol denies this, stating she just went to the restroom.The next day, Carol and Therese check out of the hotel and continue to drive. A little later, they arrive in Waterloo, Iowa, a quaint little town. Carol is giddy to be spending New Years Eve in Waterloo because she's always been the wife of Harge and her identity was always tied to him even her friends were all his acquaintances introduced through him.They spend New Years Eve together in a small motel room and listen to the radio broadcast of the celebration in Times Square back in New York. Carol remarks how she and Harge never spent the New Year together, due to his many business functions. Therese says she is also usually alone, but she's not alone this year. Carol and Therese kiss for the first time. They quietly disrobe and get into bed together, where Carol admires Therese's nude body, saying she never looked as beautiful as her. They finally consummate their strong feelings for each other and make love for the first time. After they are finished having sex, Carol holds Therese and says softly, ""My angel. Flung out of space.""The next morning, the two of them go to check out of the hotel. Carol receives a telegram while Therese loads the car with their suitcases. Carol comes outside, panicking, demanding her suitcase. She grabs the gun and runs back to the room they've just vacated. The goofy man, Tucker, is inside, without his glasses; he reveals himself to be a private detective and he has bugged their room as well as other rooms they stayed at for the past few days, recording their conversation and their sexual encounter. Carol points the gun at him, but he tells her he has already sent the recordings to his employer and there's nothing they can do. She asks how she knows he isn't lying and he replies that she doesn't. She fires the pistol at the tape recorder but no bullets come out (the gun is not loaded). Therese enters and discovers what has happened. She tells the private detective, ""How dare you!"" He responds, ""It's not personal. I'm just doing my job.""On their way to the next motel, a distraught Therese admits she feels selfish and wishes she had just said 'no' to Carol before things got complicated; she feels that she doesn't know what she wants in life anymore because all she can do is say yes to everything. Carol tenderly reassures her that none of it was her fault, and that she wanted the relationship just as much.In their motel room, Carol is somber, knowing Harge is going to use this against her at the divorce hearing. As they get ready for bed, Carol invites Therese to sleep with her. Therese joins her, and they lovingly kiss and embrace one another and proceed to make love again. When Therese wakes up the following morning, Carol is gone and Abby is there with a look of disapproval in her face.At breakfast at a local diner, Therese does not eat any food and just sits and smokes. Abby confirms that Carol is gone that she phoned her and asked to drive Therese back to New York while Carol took the first flight back from a nearby airport. Therese asks Abby why she hates her but Abby responds that she doesn't, pointing out that she just traveled across the country to bring her back to New York in Carol's car. She explains that she's not jealous of Therese because she's known Carol since they were age 10 and they had their sexual tryst as teenagers but now their relationship is strictly platonic. Abby gives Therese a letter that Carol has written to her. Therese reads it and we hear Carol in voice-over saying that one day, she will come for Therese, running towards her with open arms but for now, she has to focus on her daughter and because of this, they must not contact each other until that day comes.Back in New York City, Therese returns to her apartment and develops the photos she's taken of Carol during their road trip. She somberly remembers the woman she has now become estranged from.A few weeks later, while walking on the street, Therese runs into her friend from the New York Times. He helps paint her new place and asks if she has been somber around him because he tried to kiss her months earlier. This amuses her. He tells her there is an opening in the photojournalist department and he can recommend her for the job.Meanwhile, Carol is living with Harge again. Her daughter returns from boarding school and she is ecstatic to see her. Carol and Harge have dinner with his parents. They comment that they were told she is seeing a great doctor. She tells them she is seeing a psychotherapist, not a great doctor. Nonetheless, the family awkwardly comments that they heard the treatment was going well and that she is said to have been ""cured"". Carol is dismissive towards this.Carol meets with Abby and tells her she can't stand being with Harge. She only stayed with him to see their daughter but she is never at home. Abby mentions that she's heard Therese is doing well at her new job at New York Times.Being a woman, Therese's position at the newspaper is a secretary to the male journalists, which isn't as enthralling as she'd hoped. Carol calls Therese at home but does not speak when Therese answers. When Therese asks if it is Carol on the line, Carol struggles in how to respond but forces herself to hang up the phone by pressing down the hook switch.Carol has now hired a lawyer and is going through divorce proceedings with her husband. Harge's lawyer says if she is difficult, he will expose her a lesbian and Harge will get full custody of their daughter. Caro'ls lawyer counters by saying they've prepared a statement that Harge was so harsh to her, it is what drew her to behave amorally in the first place. Against his urging, Carol speaks candidly towards Harge. She doesn't understand why the divorce has to be so nasty. Instead of apologizing for her homosexual behavior, she admits that her feelings towards women are part of her and she doesn't know exactly how they're sourced but it doesn't negate the time she was married to her husband. Carol says she doesn't want money, that he can have full custody of their daughter she just wants visitations, even if they are supervised, and that this is not much to ask for. She advises Harge to accept it for if he refuses she will take him to court and the proceedings could get ugly, and she further states they they are not ugly people.Some months later, on April 17, 1953, at the New York Times building, Therese is told she had a letter hand delivered to her. It is from Carol, requesting that Therese meet her at 6:30 PM tonight at a restaurant at the Ritz Tower Hotel. Therese throws the letter in the garbage and continues her work.But that night, Carol shows up at the restaurant and there is Therese, waiting. The two have a conversation where Carol dotes on Therese, telling her she looks divine. She then tells Therese that she no longer lives in her house in the countryside but instead has an apartment in the city. Carol also states that she has a job as a buyer in a fabric and carpet store and still sees her daughter once or twice every month. Carol suggests that Therese move in with her but Therese refuses, still recovering from the heartbreak months earlier. Carol understands, but is clearly saddened by this. Carol tells Therese that she is meeting with some buyers at the Oak Room later that evening at 9:00 PM and invites Therese to join her, but Therese again refuses. After a moment, she says to Therese, ""I love you."" Jack, the friend from before, spots Therese and interrupts the two (this is the framing device from the beginning of the movie, as we now know the scene in context). As earlier, Jack suggests Therese and him share a ride to their friends party and Carol excuses herself, saying she is meeting friends at a restaurant and should head out anyway. As before, Carol squeezes Therese's shoulder as she exits but now we see this from a different angle instead of Jack's point of view.As before, Therese shares a taxicab with Jack as they go to their friends party, looking out the window, reminiscing about Carol. At the party, Richard is there, dancing with another girl. He shoots Therese a dirty look, hoping she is regretful for deserting him. A lesbian and friend named Genevieve Cantrell (Carrie Brownstein) seems entranced by Therese and follows her into the kitchen, trying to start up small talk. But Therese is mentally distracted and non-receptive.Some time later, with most of the party guests drunk or disoriented, Therese leaves the party and makes her way to the restaurant. The host tells her she cannot enter without a reservation but she says her friend might be inside and she steps inside without permission. Therese looks around the busy restaurant and finally spots Carol, at a table in the back, laughing among two dapper men seated with her. The frame is now from Therese's point of view as she walks towards Carol. When we catch Carol's eye, her face lights up knowing Therese has made a conscious decision to join her. Carol smiles."

When they awaken they find themselves ten years in the future, where Jacob is in charge of Lou's mansion. After determining that they are in an alternate time-line where Lou's killer is from this future, they go to their friend Adam Yates's home, only to meet his son Adam Yates Stedmeyer (Adam Jr.) who is engaged to a girl named Jill.. The film begins with an episode of the TV series ""American Success Story"" documenting the lives of the main characters since the last movie. Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) has become a mogul with his Lougle empire and his side band Motley Lou. Nick Webber (Craig Robinson) has become a popular musician mainly because he's made hit songs from the present before the actual artists could make it themselves. Lou's son Jacob (Clark Duke) hates his father and doesn't really want to be associated with him. Nick also mentions their buddy Adam Yates (John Cusack), who wrote a bestselling book and is currently going on a trip of self-discovery.Nick is seen recording a music video for the song ""Stay"", which he ripped off of Lisa Loeb and incorporated his own lyrics. The real Lisa Loeb works as his cat wrangler and mentions that the song feels personal to her. Nick quietly apologizes for stealing the song.Lou joins his employees in the board room with his employees, all of whom are sick of his man-child schtick. One of the employees, Brad (Kumail Nanjiani), points out that the company is going down hard, but Lou doesn't care. He brags about going making his success through time travel, while Brad retreats to the lab to find a way to save the company.Lou hosts a big party that night in his mansion. He makes Jacob act as a butler. Jacob spots the pretty coat-check girl, Sophie (Bianca Haase), and tries to talk to her, yet she thinks he really is just a butler. At the bar, Nick and Lou are approached by an old schoolmate, Gary Winkle (Jason Jones), who is a total loser. He tries to convince Lou to buy a piece of land from him, which Lou declines. Nick also upsets his wife Courtney (Kellee Stewart) since she wanted to go to her sister's home, but Nick always makes her go wherever he wants.Moments later, Lou goes up the stairs and makes a big speech where he tells everyone to do things for themselves and to forget everyone else, to everyone's dismay, including Lou's wife Kelly (Collette Wolfe). The lights go out, and a gunshot rings out. Somebody has shot Lou in the dick. He tumbles down the stairs bleeding profusely. Nick and Jacob grab him and pull him up the stairs. Jacob pulls a switch shaped like a squirrel, taking the guys to the deck outside to reveal the hot tub time machine. Jacob grabs a vial of nitrotrinadium and puts it in the hot tub, setting it to send them back to stop Lou's killer. Jacob also happens to spot Adam's trench coat lying by the tub. They also get blackout drunk to set the mood properly.When the guys wake up, Nick and Jacob find Lou unconscious. They think he's dead, until he farts and yells that his dick is still in place. They enter the home to find it looking a lot more lavish and clean. They look up and see a portrait of Jacob, older and more bald. Sophie enters the room topless and kisses Jacob. The guys deduce this is now Jacob's place, and that they've jumped ten years into the future. They look in the mirror and see their older selves. They run back to the hot tub, only to find that there is no more nitro left. The hot tub repairman (Chevy Chase) then shows up out of nowhere to explain that they are stuck there without nitro. Jacob then figures out that they must be in an alternate timeline, and that Lou's killer must be from the future.The guys walk the streets to see that not a lot has changed in the future (besides the dog behind them riding a hoverboard). They sit down and briefly mention how Adam would be there to solve the problem. Jacob brings up seeing Adam's coat at the party, leading Lou to think that Adam tried to kill him.The three go to Adam's home to find another man living there. His name is Adam Yates-Steadmeyer (Adam Scott), the son of Adam and his old girlfriend Jenny. Adam Jr. is excited to see Nick and Jacob, but he has no idea who Lou is. The guys explain their relation to him and their situation. They meet Adam Jr.'s fiance Jill (Gillian Jacobs). She and Adam Jr. are both fans of Nick and his ""Webber Strut"" (something Nick came up with to apologize for ripping off other artists) and she offhandedly mentions to Nick that he's fallen on hard times, something he isn't aware of.The guys, joined by Adam Jr., continue their mission, when Adam Jr. summons a smart car that runs on emotions. Lou behaves rudely around it, causing the smart car to secretly plot to kill Lou.Lou spots a building with Gary's face on it, making him think he tried to kill him and steal his success. He runs in the building and tackles Gary, but Gary explains that Lou not buying the land from him actually helped him turn a profit. He invites the guys to his nightclub, where he tells Nick he's sorry to hear about him and Courtney, something else that Nick isn't aware of. Lou does cocaine while Adam Jr. requests the strongest thing in the place. Gary gives him a new drug called ""the electric ladybug"". He has the shot girl stick it on Adam Jr.'s neck, and he advises him not to take it off for 24 hours. Adam Jr. then experiences an intense high throughout the night. At one point he calls Jill and tells her he's a god.The guys are picked up the next day to go to a popular game show, Choozy Doozy, with Nick as the special guest. Adam Jr. calls Jill again and states that the experience from the previous night led him to realize that most of what he's said and done through his life is a life, to her shock. The host (Christian Slater) tells the audience to pick something for Nick to do. After three other choices, Lou yells ""FUCK A DUDE!"" Naturally, that's what the audience chooses, but since Lou ""choosed"" it, he must ""dooze"" it. He and Nick are put in a virtual reality simulator where they are forced to have sex or get shocked by 10,000 volts of electricity. Lou chooses a lifeline and makes Adam Jr. take his place, something that Jill watches on TV.Following this experience, Jacob tells Lou that he's a virus that only causes misery everywhere he goes. He leaves to go back to Gary's club. Lou then takes off the ladybug from Adam Jr.'s neck, causing him to have a seizure. They take him to the hospital where Kelly is now a nurse, and she divorced Lou after getting clean. She gives Adam Jr. some nanobots to fight the narcotics, but they don't work with the ladybug and instead make his balls inflate. Kelly gets a needle and sticks it there to remove the fluid, squirting some all over Nick and Lou's faces.Back at the nightclub, Jacob orders every drug and drink he can get his hands on. Sophie comes in, disgusted with Jacob's antics, saying he's just like his father, a realization that hits Jacob hard. The guys return to find him, when Gary says Jacob ""went to see the family therapist."" Lou knows what this means, and he finds Jacob on the roof of his home. Lou goes up to talk him down and admits that the men in their family are screw-ups, but there's still hope for Jacob. They hug for the first time. Jacob accidentally slips off the roof, and Lou tries to save him. Their hands slip, but Jacob is saved by a suicide prevention system that he apparently invented.The guys see a news report on Brad, who has invented the nitro in the future. Adam Jr. realizes Brad will be at his wedding, which is that day. The guys rush to the chapel to find Brad while Adam Jr. goes on to get married. Jill is too mad at him from what he's said and done on TV. She gets wasted and spots Lou. The two of them have sex, which Adam Jr. unfortunately walks in on.Meanwhile, Jacob finds Brad and deduces that he's not the killer since he went on to find his own success away from Lou, and thus had no need to kill him. This doesn't stop Lou from punching Brad. The guys then learn that Adam Jr. stole the nitro and went back to the past, meaning HE is the killer, and it's Lou's own fault that he gets shot for having sex with Jill.The guys run outside to find the smart car attempting to kill Lou. He sincerely apologizes to it, and it takes the guys to the mansion. However, Adam Jr. already went back in time, taking the nitro with him. As the guys sit in hopelessness, Jacob realizes that with the nitro in the past, it must now be in the future. He opens the chamber to find many nitro vials. He puts one into the hot tub and gets them back to 2015.The guys walk in on the party the moment that Lou is going to give his speech. Lou is slightly more sincere this time around, but he and the guys spot Adam Jr. pick up a shotgun and attempt to shoot Lou in the dick. Lou talks him down and apologizes for what he's done, saying he'll blast himself. Adam Jr. is sorry and he pulls the gun away from Lou, accidentally shooting a portrait of Lou having sex with a tiger.Following this, Nick apologizes to Courtney and says he just wants to spend time with her. Lou tells Kelly he wants to get clean, and asks her to join him for a 12-step program, which she agrees to. Jacob approaches Sophie and convinces her to join him in a relationship, promising her it will be a crazy experience that will be worth it. She smiles and they kiss.The guys go outside to the hot tub once again. As Lou reflects on the adventure, a whirlpool rises behind him, and his head gets blasted off. Emerging from the whirlpool is... Patriot Lou! He tells the other three that this Lou was terrible and he needed to die. He invites the guys to join him in ""making America happen."" Against their better judgment, Nick, Jacob, and Adam Jr. follow Patriot Lou for another dip in the hot tub time machine.During the closing credits, we see the guys exploit the time machine to change history. Adam Jr. saves Lincoln from getting assassinated and even becomes the first man to land on the moon (which he says is just a sound studio in New Mexico). Jacob has sex with Marilyn Monroe. The guys discuss time travel with Einstein. They even end up becoming The Beatles, which upsets Lou since he turned out to be Ringo."

The one person he wants to reconnect with before he dies is his estranged daughter, Claire Hale, who refuses to speak to him. Through anonymous means, Damian learns of the secret Phoenix Corporation based in New Orleans and run by Dr. Albright, who, for a $250 million fee, performs a revolutionary procedure called shedding: Damian's still functioning brain with all its knowledge and memories will be transferred into a laboratory created healthy body. The procedure would entail that Damian give up his life as he knows it, but with what money he is able to stash away, to start life anew in a newly created identity, in his case thirty-five year old Phoenix born Edward Kidner. Part of the recovery is to take medication contained in a red capsule on a daily basis. In missing one dose, ""Edward"", during his recovery away from the secret and hidden facility, begins to see visions of people and places he doesn't know, but knows something about, and inherently knows exist in real life. In tracking down the people and places in his vision hopefully without Albright or his subordinates knowing, Edward begins to believe that his life under Albright's world will never be his own. In the process, he has to figure out exactly what those red capsules he takes every day actually do, which again he surmises is not exactly what Albright tells him, and how to regain a life he can call his own while also protecting/saving those Albright sees as acceptable collateral damage in unknowingly getting Damian to this point as Edward.—Huggo Business tycoon and billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is master of his own universe, until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The 33,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2006295/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the real-life event, when a gold and copper mine collapses, it traps 33 miners underground for 69 days. A docudramatic account of the 2010 Chilean mine disaster is presented, where the thirty-three miners who went into the San José Mine in Copiapó, Chile in the middle of the Atacama Desert on August 5 were trapped 700 meters underground for sixty-nine days, with all thirty-three eventually able to make it out of the mine alive. That day, mine foreman, Luis ""Don Lucho"" Urzúa, reported his concerns to mine owner, Carlos Castillo, about the unstable nature of the mountain under which the mine is located, those concerns which went unheeded. Don Lucho one of the thirty-three, went to work as usual into the mine, when that instability led to collapse in some of the underground shafts, the thirty-three who were able to make it to the refuge area, however with communication channels to the surface inoperable. Under normal circumstances, the refuge area had enough supplies to last thirty men three days. The miners also discovered that the company had failed to place the requisite ladders from the refuge area to the surface, and that the primary route out was now blocked by a shifted rock, its mass the equivalent of the Empire State Building. The thirty-three were ultimately led by Mario Sepúlveda, who was not going to let any of the thirty-three take priority over any of the others, especially in the initial panic and instinct for self-survival among some. On the surface, loved ones of the trapped miners held vigil at the mine, with María Segovia, elder sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, arguably the most outspoken in condemnation of the powers that be not doing anything to search for the miners, not knowing if they were dead or alive, but who was also quick to give praise where praise was due. That praise largely went to the relatively new Minister of Mines, Laurence Golborne, who was determined both to do whatever he could on behalf of the government to look for the men and to provide accurate assessments to those holding vigil of the situation, especially in Castillo seeing miner deaths solely as an unfortunate nature of the business. The chief engineer assigned to drill toward the refuge area in the hopes that the miners were there was Andre Sougarret, who admitted that the process was not a scientific one as one would have hoped. Once the miners were discovered alive in the refuge area, the next phase of trying to extract them held its own new challenges for all concerned, both logistical and emotional.—Huggo Dozens of people from Copiapó, Chile, work in the San José mine. The owner ignores the warnings of the failing stability of the mine, which collapses a short time later. The only path inside the mine is completely blocked, and the thirty-three miners manage to get to the rescue chamber. They discover that the radio is useless, the medical kit is empty, the ventilation shafts lack the required ladders, and there is very little stored food. Mario Sepúlveda becomes the leader of the miners, dividing the foods rations and stopping the outbursts of violence and despair. The mine company does not attempt any rescue, and the relatives of the miners gather around the gates.. August 5, 2010. As the small copper-and-gold San José mine collapses, trapping 33 men 700 metres underground, the entire world focuses on Copiapó, Chile. In the following 69 days after the devastating cave-in, an international rescue team tirelessly works day and night to save the trapped miners, as the families and friends of the doomed crew can only pray for a miracle. This is the story of Mario Sepúlveda and his enclosed companions, who, against all odds, had to endure sweltering heat, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion to survive in a desperate race against time.—Nick Riganas An opening text reads: 'Every year 12,000 miners die in work related accidents.'Copiapo, Chile.Many of the town's men dig for gold in the San José mine. Mario (Antonio Banderas) takes extra shifts to support his wife Katty and his daughter Escarlette. Álex (Mario Casas) considers taking a much safer job despite that it may pay much less to ease the mind of his pregnant wife Jessica and his father Don José. Darío (Juan Pablo Raba) would rather sleep on park benches than accept the charity of his estranged sister María (Juliette Binoche). Yonni (Oscar Nunez) entertains his fellow miners with his romantic escapades, while Edison (Jacob Vargas) dresses and behaves like an Elvis impersonator. José (Marco Trevino) doubles as a pastor for the men when they head below ground; shift foreman Luis (Lou Diamond Phillips) has growing concerns about the safety of the San José mine. Gomex (Gustavo Angarita), the crews oldest member, will retire in two weeks.August 5, 2010. Day 1.Mario, Álex, Darío, Yonni, Edison, José, Gomex, Luis, and other men board a shuttle bus to the San José mine. While driving through the desert, they pass Carlos (Tenoch Huerta), a Bolivian transplant walking to his first shift at the mine. The bus does not stop to pick him up. Before their shift begins, Luis storms into his boss Castillo's office. While inspecting the stability of the tunnels below ground, he discovered a shard of glass. Luis explains that mirrors were placed between the fissures of the mountain; some of the mirrors have broken, which means the mountain shifted. Luis, concerned about the safety of his men, thinks the mine should be shut down. Castillo disagrees and sends Luis away. Outside, Edison berates Carlos because he comes from Bolivia, where men dig tin but not gold. Everyone climbs aboard a truck, which drives them into the mine through its only entrance and exit: a narrow tunnel. Carlos quickly becomes claustrophobic.The Machine Shop. Dig site. 1,700 feet below ground. 90°F.The men set to work. Luis continues to inspect the tunnels and finds more shards of glass. Mario shows Carlos how to operate an excavator. Álex asks Darío if he should take the lower paying job; Darío is hungover and doesnt care. Without warning, the ground begins to shake. Giant boulders rain down upon the miners. Everyone runs to the trucks and drive like mad for the Refuge (dig site, 2,300 feet below ground, 94°F), a place built for miners to wait during a cave in. Tunnels collapse, the trucks careen into giant boulders, and the men are thrown every which way. Above ground, the entrance to the mine gives way in a puff of smoke. All in all, thirty-three workers have been trapped underground.Above ground, Castillo shuts down the mine site and tries to prevent anyone from leaving. Two miners manage to drive away before Castillo bars the gates; the men call newscasters to report the collapse. The families of the men trapped underground rush to the gates of the San José mine and demand answers. At the presidential palace in the capital city of Santiago, the minister of mining Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro) tells President Pinera (Bob Gunton) that the mining company cannot handle the rescue expedition. Despite being new to his job, Lauren convinces the president to intervene.Underground, the miners gather and assess their options. A staggeringly large boulder blocks them off from the roads leading out of the mine. Luis wants the men to go to the Refuge, where there is enough food and water to last thirty men for three days. Mario will not give up so easily. He wants to inspect the ladders that extend up the mines chimneys: if the chimneys have not been blocked, they can all climb out. Álex offers to join him. Luis fails to stop them.Day 2.Below ground, Mario and Álex climb the ladders. They quickly discover that the ladders stop halfway up the chimney. Their employers never bothered to finish them. Luis discovers that the communication radios installed in the Refuge were never finished. Darío attacks Yonni to get access to the food rations. The men discover eighteen cans of tuna, a few packets of cookies, and some milk cartons. Mario confronts Luis, who knew the ladders were never finished. Luis has given up hope: it took a century for the miners to dig this deep, and the company that owns the mine will never pay for their rescue. He believes they will die underground. Mario and Luis almost come to blows, but when Darío begins to eat the rations, a riot erupts. Mario calms the other men down and earns their respect: they put him in charge of the rations.Above ground, Laurence arrives at the mine site. María confronts him and will not let him pass until he has sworn he will save the men trapped in the mine. Castillo tells Laurence he tried to send a team of rescuers down a chimney but that it collapsed. Its too dangerous to attempt another rescue. When Laurence delivers the news to the miners families, María attacks him for failing them. President Pinera calls upon André Sougarret, a well-respected mining engineer. André tells Laurence that, even if they began digging immediately, it would take about eight days to reach the trapped men. To complicate matters, the rockbed could cause the drills to veer away from the Refuge. Reaching the men will be a challenge, and they dont have any time to spare.Day 3.Below ground, Mario distributes meager rations. The men manage to restore the Refuges lights, which raises their spirits. When they hear the drills and realize they will be rescued, their moods rise.Day 5.The drills have been working nonstop but break frequently because of the incredibly hard rock of the mountain. André becomes impatient with Laurence when the other man asks him too many questions. The families of the miners have set up camp outside of the mine site. Laurence, unable to answer whether the trapped men are still alive, feels helpless when he addresses them. He organizes a camp that will provide shelter, food, medical attention, and schooling for the rescuers and the families of the trapped miners. María finds Laurence and thanks him for keeping his promise. Below ground, Darío struggles through withdrawal. José comforts and prays with him.Day 8.Camp Hope is up and running. Katty and Escarlette cook food; Jessica teaches the children of the miners; Yonnis wife and mistress come to blows over who will be the one to greet him.Day 14.A drill finally reaches the depth of the Refuge. Above ground, Laurence and André and the miners families wait anxiously for the machinery to break through the rock. Below ground, the men hear the drills approach and rejoice. Their celebration ends abruptly, when they realize the drill has bypassed the Refuge. Álex breaks down and runs to a ledge within the cavern. Mario convinces him not to jump by reminding him of his responsibilities as a father. Days pass, and hope dwindles. The miners eat the last of their rations and imagine it is a feast attended by their loved ones. Above ground, André tells Laurence that the men are probably dead. He's giving up. Laurence is furious, but after talking with María, he has an idea: based on their past miscalculations, they should direct the drills along the fissures in the rock. When he explains his plan to André, the engineer realizes its brilliant.Day 17.Mario walks through the Refuge and sees how badly the men are doing. Álex is talking to himself. José has difficulty breathing. Carlos seems lost in his own mind. To his astonishment, one of the drills breaks through the cavern ceiling. Mario calls the other men, and they bang upon the drill. Aboveground, Laurence hears the noise. The miners attach a note to the drill, which President Pinera reads to the miners families: all thirty-three men are alive. Everyone rejoices. Even Yonni's wife and mistress embrace. André tells Laurence that extracting the men still presents a challenge: nothing like this has been attempted before.More days pass. The rescue team lowers a camera into the Refuge, allowing the men to communicate with the world above. Now that they've found the men, they can send them food and more: iPods, magazines, new clothes. The men's health improves, but they grow tired of living in close quarters. Mario quickly becomes the face of the miners, and they resent his rise to fame -- especially when Yonni reads in a paper that Super Mario has been offered a book deal. Mario does not respond to his friends criticisms well and takes credit for keeping them alive. Edison leads a coup and ousts Mario from power. Above ground, the president is furious that the drills keep breaking, delaying the miners rescue. Below ground, Darío finds Mario. He confesses he doesn't know what to say to María once they're rescued: she abandoned their family, and him, when he was young. Mario tells him to forgive María and pray to god she forgives him. Edison awakens and believes Carlos has stolen his iPod. When he tries to beat Carlos, Carlos pulls a knife on him. Mario breaks up their fight and apologizes for letting his fame get to his head. All of the men, including Edison and Carlos, embrace Mario and welcome him back into the fold.Day 58.Luis hears the drills approach and realizes it will hit an iron support beam if it continues on its current path. Hitting the beam will break the drill and delay their rescue again. The miners tell Laurence and André that they will have to use a controlled explosion to take out the iron beam underground. They're willing to assume that risk. Above ground, the families know the men will be rescued soon. Jessica goes into labor but refuses to leave the mine site. Yonni's wife decides to leave him (and Camp Hope) while his mistress is invited to the extraction site by María. An extraction capsule will carry the miners out one by one. Laurence and André tells the miners that, due to the mountains instability, there is not enough time to enforce the shaft that the capsule will travel. If anything happens as the capsule goes down and up, then it might be impossible to get the miners out. The first man will be in the most danger but might also be the only man to get out.October 13, 2010.The extraction capsule reaches the Refuge. Álex is chosen to be the first one taken out. He tells his friends he will see them above ground. The extraction goes off without a hitch, and Álex emerges from the capsule to find his father, Jessica, and their newborn daughter waiting for him. The rest of the men emerge one-by-one. Mario whips the crowd into a frenzy. Edison and Yonni strikes poses. President Pinera embraces Laurence and congratulates him. Darío and Mario hug each other. Luis is the last man to be taken up, and the film ends as he steps into the capsule.The San José Mining Company was found not guilty of criminal negligence, and the miners were never compensated. Nonetheless, they remain brothers to this day."
The Danish Girl,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810819/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fictitious love story loosely inspired by the lives of Danish artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. Lili and Gerda's marriage and work evolve as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a transgender pioneer. Copenhagen, Denmark, 1926. Einar Wegener (played by Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander) are a happily married couple. Both are artists, Einar preferring landscapes and she portraits. One day Einar poses for a portrait of Gerda's while wearing a dress. This is initially done as a lark, as is the later attendance at a party dressed as a woman. However, Einar soon discovers that she is in fact a woman and over time prefers being Lili. At first she and Gerda try to have her situation ""cured"" but this leads nowhere (other than to many doctors trying to have Lili locked up as a pervert and/or lunatic). Her voyage of self-discovery will ultimately lead to her undergoing the first ever sex-change operation.—grantss Set in early 1920s Copenhagen, real-life renowned painter artist Einar Wegener shares a strongly-bonded and filled with love marriage with his less recognised portraitist wife, Gerda. However, the very foundation of their relationship is about to be compromised, when one day, Gerda will playfully ask of Einar to fill in for one of her female models and pose for her painting dressed in a marvellous dress. Unobtrusively, this life-changing experience will trigger a subtle transformation inside Einar, who will begin to realise that, in reality, he is Lili, a woman trapped in a man's body, and that his real, true self should start living as a proper woman. As more and more it will become evident that this is not an ephemeral caprice, Einar determined to live his new life to the full, will boldly attempt amidst prejudice, discrimination, social dictations, and of course, public outcry, to fight for the right to be different and undergo a highly experimental sex reassignment surgery that would eventually make Lili a notable transgender pioneer.—Nick Riganas 1926. Copenhagen-based married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, who are madly in love, have so far tried unsuccessfully to have a child. They both work as artists, and while Einar has a modicum of critical success for his landscapes, Gerda has not had much critical success with her portraits. An innocent enough request by Gerda to her husband leads to Einar exploring his feminine side. While Gerda sees that exploration all in fun, it becomes more for Einar, who, hearkening back to a time long ago in his past, ultimately allows himself truly to believe that he is a woman, ""Lili"", born into a male body. He wants to experience all that being Lili is, including sexually, and not as Einar pretending to be a woman. The emotions that Gerda develops when she learns what Einar is truly going through spurs some creative energy in her art, which was not present before. Wanting some medical diagnosis for what she is feeling, Lili is told again and again that she is crazy, most physicians who want to institutionalize her on the spot, until she meets Dr. Kurt Warnekros, who believes he can perform two risky gender reassignment surgeries for her fully to become Lili. As such, Lili dreams of getting remarried and having a child in that post-surgery life. Both Lili and Gerda have to decide how long Gerda will go along with Lili for this ride, especially as they both know that the end, if it happens, is that Gerda will lose her husband forever, Lili who states it meaning all of Einar including his art.—Huggo The film begins with a montage of landscapes. Then we see a painting, which looks just as realistic as the cinematography we have just seen. The artwork is observed by Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander). It is revealed that she is attending an art show when a patron comments that Gerda's work is not as exquisite as her husband's, the artist of the painting Gerda was admiring. The gallery owner declares Gerda's husband, Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), to be part of the one percent of gifted Danish talents.A title card reads that it is the year 1926 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Einar and Gerda walk home from the art show together. She makes fun of the man declaring Einar part of the one percent. A man shouts down at them to be quiet because it's late at night. They laugh and hurry home.The next morning, Gerda is painting a man's portrait. Simultaneously, Einar visits their friend, Oona Paulson (Amber Heard) at her ballet class. He says he wants to give Gerda space to work and his presence would be distracting. At their home, Gerda tells a middle-aged man who she is painting that men tend to be afraid of the gaze of a woman.Einar is working on a painting of his own, of five trees in the woods, an actual sight in their town. His paintings take much longer to complete than hers, as he is very meticulous at detail. Einar and Gerda are affectionate with each other and they begin to have sex. While she is undressing, he asks her to leave her undergarments on as he finds them beautiful. He caresses her clothes and then they make love.Gerda is finishing a large portrait of a woman but Oola is supposed to serve as her model and she has not arrived. She asks Einar to wear the stockings and shoes so that she can finish painting that part of the picture. He nervously agrees and she has to educate him on how to put the stockings on. She then has him hold the dress up so that it will flow over the stockings properly. Just then, Oola shows up with flowers. She is delighted at the sight of Einar serving as the model and hands him a lily, telling him that that must be his name.Gerda meets with an art collector to evaluate her portraits and paintings, including the one with the stockings. He tells her that sketches of people are commonplace and there is nothing unique about them but she is a good artist who just needs a better subject.When Gerda returns home, she explains the feedback she received to Einar. They begin to kiss and she begins to take off his shirt. Underneath, he is wearing her undergarments. This takes her aback but she doesn't acknowledge it directly and instead, she simply continues touching him underneath the brassiere he is wearing.In the morning, Gerda sketches Einar while he sleeps but in an androgynous way so its not clear if the picture is supposed to be of a male or female. When he wakes up, she tells him how beautiful he is.The next day, Gerda and Einar join Oola for a gathering. Oola tells them that she has had relations with two nearby men at the same time. They are stunned by this and she giggles that its so easy to shock married people. Gerda tells Oola how Einar and her first met when he admired her ankles. He was too shy to ask her out so she did it for him. He was so beautiful that when they kissed, she felt as if she was kissing herself (another woman). This makes Oola blush and Gerda comments that its so easy to shock unmarried people.There is an event that Gerda and Einar are invited to but he doesn't want to go because the people gush over him as an artist. Gerda realizes that he can go in disguise, as Lili. Gerda puts makeup on Einar's face and finds a wig for him. He has transformed and he delights at being able to inhabit the identity of a woman.They attend the party and everyone is told Einar couldn't attend but his cousin, ""Lili"", has taken his place. Lili is left on his/her own and she catches the eye of Henrik (Ben Whishaw) who is immediately intrigued by ""her"". They isolate themselves and Henrik flirts with Lili, who is awkward in response. Henrik tells her a man should always ask a woman before he kisses her and then leans in. She pulls away and says he didn't ask. But he tells her he didn't want her to refuse. Gerda walks in and witnesses the two clumsily kissing. Lili begins to have a nosebleed and becomes frightened. Gerda leads her away.At home, Gerda is confused about what she witnessed. She doesn't understand why the game they were playing went so far. Einar tries to explain that he didn't want to kiss Henrik but when he was in the mind of Lili, she did so it was Lili who wanted to, not him. Gerda asks if he has kissed boys before. He says only once, when he was very young with a friend of his. His father saw it happen and got very upset with him.Gerda now has found her subject: she paints Einar as Lili. When she presents these paintings to the art collector, he loves them and wants to have a show with them. The collector wants to meet the model but Gerda tells him it was Einar's cousin who has since left town. At home, Einar is wearing Gerda's undergarments as he looks in the mirror and studies his body. He strips himself bare and then finally removes his trousers. He looks at his penis with disgust and tucks it between his legs.When Gerda gets home to tell Einar of the praise the collector has given her Lili portraits, she is surprised to see Einar dressed as Lili. She wonders if something is the matter with him and suggests they go see a doctor. They do and the doctor makes notes of the nosebleeds, as well as the stomach cramps he imagines having once a month. Einar tries to explain he has always felt like a girl despite being in a male body.The next time Gerda meets the art collector, she is told he sold all the paintings and there is representation interested in her in Paris. He encourages her to go and become an esteemed artist in France. Gerda encourages Einar to join her, as she will need Lili as a model for her paintings. The two of them set out to live in Paris.In France, Einar continues to serve as the model for Gerda's portraits. They seem to be distancing themselves from each other. While Gerda is out that evening, Einar goes to the seedy part of Paris' red-light district and enters a peep-show club. He watches a woman strip naked. But instead of being aroused by her, he starts to mimic her movements. She notices this and they do a back and forth game where they mirror each other.Gerda goes to meet Hans Axgil (Matthias Schoenaerts), a childhood friend of Einar's. Hans tells someone on the phone he must go because he has a ""Danish girl"" waiting for him (interesting because the movie's title alludes to both Lili and Gerda). He tells Gerda he loves her artwork but he cannot represent her because he doesn't specialize in those kind of paintings. He asks to meet the model and she tells him it is Einar's cousin but she is not around. However, she tells Axgil that Einar is waiting for them at home though.When they get to the house, Einar is dressed as Lili. Gerda has to completely backpedal and explain that this is Einar's cousin and Einar is out. ""Lili"" brazenly flirts with Hans who is very suspicious. Lili becomes frazzled and runs off. When Gerda comes to join him, he tries to assure himself that Hans has not detected the reality of who he is.Gerda attends an art show for her Lili paintings. Hans is there and he tries to kiss her, knowing that her husband is a transsexual, but she stops him and tells him, ""Einar is still my husband"". Hence sets up a unique love triangle Hans loves Gerda who loves Einar who loves Hans. All of this overwhelms Gerda who leaves the event despite it pouring down rain, refusing an umbrella in lieu of walking down the street. Hans finds her and brings her to shelter.At home, the three are gathered in the kitchen. Hans reveals to Gerda that he was the childhood friend that had once kissed Einar. Einar was dressed in his grandma's apron while they were playing pretend. Hans thought Einar looked so pretty, he just had to kiss him. He was then sent home while Einar's dad violently responded to his son.Gerda wonders if she has turned Einar into a transsexual when she dressed him up for the event but he tells her he's felt like that his whole life and she merely gave him the first opportunity to experience it. Because he is still confused about his feelings, Gerda and Einar visit various doctors in Paris in hopes that they will be able to make sense of the situation. The first doctor suggests a lobotomy, telling Einar he will make two holes on each side of his head. The second one tells Einar that his diagnosis is bad that he believes Einar is a homosexual. The third excuses himself during the meeting. When Einar looks at his notes, he sees the man suspects that Einar is a schizophrenic. As the doctor rushes back to the office with a security team and a straitjacket, Einar escapes out a window.Oola is in Paris and she tells Einar and Gerda about a doctor who has treated a patient with the same situation as Einar. They meet with the doctor who is progressive and tells that he once met a man who believed he should be a woman, so he set to perform two operations the first, to remove his man bits and after he's recovered his strength, a second, to construct a vagina. But the man got scared and disappeared on the day of the surgery. Excitedly, Einar says that he wouldn't do that. And he agrees to have what will be the first sex change operation.Einar is standing in front of a train, to be taken to the hospital where the surgery will be performed. Gerda tells him she will be there for the surgery but he wants to be alone. Hans tells Einar, ""I've loved only a handful of people and you are definitely two of them.""Einar is admitted to the hospital. He is giddy with excitement and looks at himself lovingly in the mirror. He then decides not to put his wig on and to instead stylize his own hair in a feminine manner.On the patio of the hospital, a pregnant woman asks ""Lili"" if she is there because she is going to have a baby. Lili says maybe someday, not knowing what the limitations will be to the surgery (i.e., if she'll be able to get pregnant).The doctor goes over the procedure with Einar/Lili and she glows with anticipation. She tells the doctor she hopes her husband will be handsome like he is and mentions her hope of giving birth. The doctor warns that the surgery will be very brutal but Einar/Lili says she will sleep through it.The first surgery ends up being just as the doctor predicted brutal. Gerda arrive as a surprise, to support Lili. Although she is drained by the operation, Lili is also enthralled that it was performed. She is given estrogen pills to take every few hours but explicitly told to spread them out throughout the day.Although the surgery is only half done (Einar/Lili no longer has a penis but doesn't have a vagina yet), Lili enjoys living her life completely as a woman. Instead of painting, she gets a job as a sales clerk in a local department store. She shares some tips on how to apply perfume to customers, telling them that when she was in Paris, women never applied perfume directly on their skin. They would spray it in the air and then walk into it. This tip is well received.When Lili walks through a park, two local French men heckle her, calling her a lesbian and asking if she has a ""hoo hah"". When cornered, she punches one of them but the other one retaliates by badly beating up Lili.Gerda runs into Lili in the marketplace, where she is fraternizing with Henrik (the Ben Whishaw character she met when she was first dressed as Lili). Lili visits Gerda's home and tells her she is not romantically linked to Henrik because he is a homosexual. Gerda tries to encourage Lili to paint alongside her like they used to. But Lili is adamant that she has left Einar behind and no longer wants to do the things she did when she was living as a male. She then takes an estrogen pill, which upsets Gerda because Lili has just taken some ten minutes earlier (the doctor emphasized they have to be taken far apart). Lili defensively states that she knows what she's doing. Its obvious she wants to rush the process.Lili arranges to have the second part of her surgery despite Gerda telling her its too early. But the doctor agrees so she returns to the hospital and undergoes the procedure. Both Gerda and Hans are there for support but the doctor tells them the surgery did not gone well and the prognosis does not look good.Gerda and Hans visit Lili in the recovery room and she looks close to death. Nonetheless, she is happy and tells them, in a weak voice, that she finally feels like who she was meant to be. She adds that God made her a girl but there was some mistake in her physicality.Gerda takes Lili outside in a wheelchair so he can get out of the hospital room. Even though she is sick, Lili is happy. But despite her bliss, Lili passes away, leaving Gerda distraught.In the final scene, Hans and Gerda go walking through Denmark and stop at a set of five trees, the ones Einar had been painting early in the film. The scarf that Gerda is wearing blows away in the wind. Hans goes to retrieve it but she tells him to leave it alone. The piece of women's clothing floats in the sky, above the beautiful landscapes that Einar once painted, symbolizing that Lili was finally free."

With innovative photorealistic techniques and IMAX 3D wizardry, The Walk is true big-screen cinema, a chance for moviegoers to viscerally experience the feeling of reaching the clouds. The film, a PG-rated, all-audience entertainment for moviegoers 8 to 80, unlike anything audiences have seen before, is a love letter to Paris and New York City in the 1970s, but most of all, to the Towers of the World Trade Center.—Sony Pictures Entertainment With the help from several international recruits, his mentor- Papa Rudy, and the love from his close related person, Phillippe Petit created a team that will help him pursue his dream- a plan to walk between the void from the two towers of World Trade Center, which affected by several issues that will be eradicate the plan, both internally or externally.—Gusde In 1974 Philippe Petit, a French wire walker, dreams of walking the tallest building in the world, The World Trade Center. He consults with an expert Papa Rudy and he meets some people whom he recruits to help him. Eventually he goes to New York to plan the thing and hopefully do it before the building officially opens.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1974, the French street juggler and equilibrist Philippe Petit decides to cross the towers of the World Trade Center walking on a tightrope. He travels from France to the USA with his girlfriend Annie and their friend and photographer Jean-Louis. They team-up with a small group of residents and plot a scheme to take their equipment to the roof of the building. Will Philippe make his dream come true?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stands atop the Statue of Liberty telling the audience that he does not fear death and never says the word (except for when he is explaining himself), and that is why he walks the wire. This inspired him to follow his dream to hang a wire between the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center and walk across it.He takes us back to Paris, France in 1973 where he used to be a street performer playing to dazzled crowds, but Philippe was always running from the police for performing without a permit. While collecting money from the viewers, he tosses a jawbreaker that a girl gave him, which he catches in his mouth and accidentally bites into, naturally causing him pain.Philippe goes to the dentist and finds a magazine advertising the unfinished Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. He is instantly amazed and swipes the page out the magazine. His dream has now been born.We see a flashback to when Philippe was a child and he first saw high-wire walkers at the circus. He would practice at home, to his father's dismay. One day, as an adult, Philippe attempted to walk the wire in the circus tent, only to be caught by the circus owner Rudy Omankowsky, aka ""Papa Rudy"" (Ben Kingsley). Rudy chases Philippe away, until Philippe grabs some items off the ground and starts juggling them, impressing Rudy. He later asks Rudy to help him practice wire-walking with the promise of payment.Philippe leaves his home and parents behind to pursue his dream. His mother cries while his father thinks he's a clown. Philippe rides his unicycle into town with his bags and sees a lady named Annie (Charlotte Le Bon), who is singing and playing her guitar before a crowd of onlookers. Philippe decides to set up his own little performance circle and quickly steals Annie's audience. She later approaches him with disdain, but Philippe defends himself and says he only wanted to share the audience with Annie. It starts to rain, and Philippe walks with her under his umbrella. Quickly, he wins her over and they fall in love, leading Annie to become Philippe's first ""accomplice"" in setting up his wire walk.Philippe meets and befriends Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony), a photographer who becomes Philippe's second accomplice, as he is also a skilled archer that can shoot an arrow with the proper wiring from one tower to the other. Philippe practices a wire-walk in the park over a lake while there is a fishing contest going on. The fishermen boo him, causing him to break his concentration and fall into the lake.Ever determined, Philippe decides to use the towers of Notre Dame as part of his next performance. He sets up the wires at night and walks as the tourists show up in the early hours of the day. Although his walk is successful, Philippe is arrested.Philippe next meets Accomplice #3, Jean-Francois, aka: Jeff (Cesar Domboy), an algebra teacher that only speaks English in math equations, and he also happens to be deathly afraid of heights. Together, they, along with Annie and Jean-Louis travel to New York City for the first time to get a good look at the towers, still under construction. Philippe panics at first when he enters the South Tower because he fears that the tower is too tall to scale and it would be impossible to hang the wire. However, he sneaks in through the construction elevator and makes it to the unfinished observation deck. There, he walks over a beam to get a feel of how he will accomplish his task, and his passion is instantly refueled.Upon returning to France, Philippe plans what he calls ""The Coup"" for August 6th 1974, since it'll be right before the towers are complete and the weather will be fine. Rudy urges Philippe to use a safety harness, as he would not even let his own sons (all experience high-wire artists) walk at a great height without safety harnesses, but Philippe refuses, saying it would defeat the purpose of what he hoped to accomplish. Rudy decides to stand behind Philippe's choice and he gives him all the payment money back to allow him to pursue his dream.The crew returns to New York, and Philippe begins going undercover in different disguises to learn measurements, distance, and the like to get an idea of how he's going to pull off The Coup. He hits a snag when he accidentally steps on an nail that impales his foot. Despite this, he refuses to seek treatment and wants to keep going.Philippe gathers more accomplices, starting with Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine), who becomes the inside man since he works on the 82nd floor of the South Tower. Philippe next meets Jean-Pierre, or JP (James Badge Dale), an American that speaks French and gives Philippe a wired radio to avoid having the cops pick up their chatter. JP then introduces Philippe to Albert (Ben Schwartz) and David (Benedict Samuel), the final two accomplices.As the date of The Coup approaches, Philippe appears to be losing his mind. He gets a crate with the wires, which he refers to as his coffin. He bangs the nails on the crate loudly at night, waking Annie and making her angry when he refers to it as his coffin. She expresses her concern for his well-being.August 6th arrives, and the crew begins to initiate The Coup. Philippe, Jeff, JP, and David disguise themselves as delivery men to take the wires to the top of the South Tower. They are not allowed access to the elevator as they're being rented out by other workers. JP talks down one of the men working in the tower and allows the men to make the ""delivery."" After getting everything to the top, David bails in a pot-induced paranoid episode when he thinks the cops are coming after him, leaving Philippe and Jeff up there. The men prepare to set up when it's nighttime, but their work is interrupted by a guard, forcing the two to hide in a tarp that happens to be placed over a shaft. Jeff becomes terrified, while his fear only makes Philippe hallucinate briefly.The guard passes out, allowing Philippe and Jeff to get to the roof. They see Jean-Louis and Albert on the roof of the North Tower, and Jean-Louis shoots the arrow with the string attached. Philippe doesn't hear the arrow making an impact, so he frantically tries to feel for the string, going as far as taking his clothes off and jumping around. He spots the arrow hanging over the side of the roof, and he catches it before it falls. He and Jeff continue to set up the wiring, only to hear the guard approaching the steps. The two hide, and the guard is called away for some pizza.It's almost morning. Albert decides to bail because he thinks Philippe will fail, and he also plans to sell off photographs himself. The wiring is almost complete, when an unknown man (Yanik Ethier) goes up to the roof. He says nothing and only looks around briefly before looking at Philippe approvingly. Philippe (in his narration) states that he referred to this man as the ""mysterious visitor"".The wiring is complete, and Philippe starts to put on his costume, but his turtleneck falls over the building. He is angry because he doesn't want to do the walk in his undershirt, but he decides to do it anyway. And so, Philippe grabs his balancing pole and begins to make his daring walk over the wire. Annie, Barry, and JP watch from the ground, calling attention to the other New Yorkers. Philippe carefully makes his steps over the wire before making it to the North Tower. The people cheer and applaud him from below. Not feeling completed, Philippe claims that he felt the wire was still calling to him, so he walks back toward the South Tower. Two officers show up on the roof and detain Jeff. Philippe decides to walk back toward the North Tower to taunt the cops. More cops show up on the North Tower as he approaches it. The cops try and carefully talk him into walking back toward them, but Philippe only frightens them by laying on the wire before getting up when a bird passes over him. Philippe finally walks back to the South Tower and surrenders calmly. Later, a construction worker tries to saw the wire, but Philippe pleads with him not to do so, as the wire could snap and hurt someone. The cops agree, and Philippe tells them where the wiring is hidden within the wall.Although Philippe is arrested, the cops are more amazed than angry. Philippe's story becomes worldwide news, and even Rudy is proud of Philippe. He and his crew celebrate their victory.Philippe narrates that the judge mandated that he do a free high-wire performance in Central Park for families, which he was more than happy to do. Sadly for him, Annie decided to return to France so she can follow her own dreams. Philippe also states that he was given a pass to access the top of the towers whenever he wanted, along with a semi-playful condition that he must not use it to repeat his high-wire stunt there. He noted that the passes have an expiration date, but the WTC director crossed out the expiration date and wrote ""forever""... and the smile fades from Philippe's face before he walks off-screen.The film closes with one last shot of the towers... which are there no more."

Hardcore Henry,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3072482/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Henry is resurrected from death with no memory, and he must save his wife from a telekinetic warlord with a plan to bio-engineer soldiers. Waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. A scientist, Estelle, greets him and tells him his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. After she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic prostheses, mercenaries led by the psychokinetic Akan raid the ship, claiming all of Estelle's research is Akan's corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists before attempting to murder Henry, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. Estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill Henry.. Hardcore Henry is an action film told from a first person perspective: You remember nothing. Mainly because you've just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who's got her? His name's Akan; he's a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You're also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy. He may be on your side, but you aren't sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You're likely going to need it...—STX Entertainment Henry, a newly resurrected cyborg who must save his wife/creator from the clutches of a psychotic tyrant with telekinetic powers, AKAN, and his army of mercenaries. Fighting alongside Henry is Jimmy, who is Henry's only hope to make it through the day. Hardcore takes place over the course of one day, in Moscow, Russia.—Jan Nielsen Note: this entire, experimental film takes place from the first-person POV (point-of-view) of Henry.The film starts with a memory from Henry's childhood. Three bullies stand before him, and one of them is holding a toy of Henry's. The bully hurls the toy against the wall and smashes it. A man, Henry's father (Tim Roth), looks at him and says ""You...little...pussy...""The adult Henry wakes up in a facility. A woman named Estelle (Haley Bennett) brings him up from a water tank. Henry sees he's missing his left forearm and his left leg below the knee. Estelle replaces them with robotic limbs. Henry is unable to speak because his voice box hasn't been installed yet, and he has no memory of how he got to where he is. Estelle claims that she is Henry's wife.Estelle brings Henry into a room with two other scientists, Robbie (Will Stewart) and Timothy (Ilya Naishuller). They prepare to install Henry's voice until a team of mercenaries led by Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) storm in. They blow the door open, crushing Robbie. Akan asks Timothy to explain Henry's arrival at the facility. Timothy says that Henry's limbs were shot off and his skull was fractured badly until now. Akan then uses telekinetic powers to levitate Timothy and stab him to death. He plans to create an army of soldiers similar to Henry. Estelle plays a loud sound to hold the mercs off and give her and Henry a chance to run. She leads him to an escape pod for the two of them. They are ejected from the facility, which happens to be up in the sky. The pod lands on a bridge.After Henry pulls Estelle out of the pod, another team of mercs led by Yuri (Oleg Poddubnyy) arrive. Estelle tells Henry to engage them. Henry punches Yuri and gets a few good hits, but the mercs take him down, and Yuri pushes Henry off the bridge. He lands on a car and then runs into a freight container. There, he finds a car and turns it on, letting it roll out to hit the mercs. He fights the mercs until a van runs through and plows through the villains. The driver is a man named Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). He kills two other mercs and tells Henry to follow him, knowing who he is.As they drive, Jimmy tells Henry to open the glove box, where he finds a charger for his body. They are stopped by two cops, who turn out to be dirty crooks working for Akan. They shoot Jimmy in the head, forcing Henry to run through the subway for safety. The cops find him there, but Henry fights them and shoots one of them to death. Henry runs back out into the streets and onto a bus. There, he finds Jimmy (actually a clone) dressed like a homeless man. He rips a tracking device out of Henry's arm and then tells him to find a man named Slick Dimitry (Andrei Dementiev) and take his booster pad from his chest, and then to meet up with Jimmy after the task is complete. Jimmy then looks out the window and sees a man in a metal suit. He sticks his head out to make fun of him until the man wields a flamethrower. Homeless Jimmy gets burnt alive, and Henry must run again.Henry finds the building where Dimitry is located. He climbs the building and enters through a window. He kills the goons he comes across before making it into Dimitry's room. Dimitry is motionless. On his monitor, Estelle appears to tell Henry that Akan has begun with his plan and is preparing his army. Dimitry then springs up and attacks Henry. Henry chases Dimitry through the building and then through the city. Dimitry stumbles, giving Henry a chance to beat him. Dimitry then says he has something to say regarding Jimmy, but his head is blown off before he can say anything else. Henry evades the mercs.Henry arrives at the location Jimmy told him to find him, which is a brothel. Henry meets Cokehead Jimmy laying with five women. Jimmy tries to put the booster pad into Henry's chest, but he's in a bad condition to do so. He leaves Henry with the women, who comment on Henry being cute and then start playing with him. He starts seeing memories of himself and Estelle getting intimate. A more shaped-up Jimmy shows up and installs the booster pad. More villainous mercs show up. Henry shoots through them before reaching a room where Akan is sitting. He kills a man by flinging a silver plate into his head. Akan escapes, and Henry kills more mercs. He and Jimmy run into two dominatrix assassins, Katya (Darya Charusha) and Olga (Svetlana Ostinova), who also have a bone to pick with Akan. Jimmy then orders Henry to hop on a motorcycle and chase after one of Akan's vans.Henry rides the motorcycle and shoots more mercs on the van, while also hurling some grenades their way. He gets to the main van and slices two more goons before he finds Estelle. They embrace, but Akan rears his ugly head and blows a hole into the van to make his entrance. He uses his powers to knock Henry out.Henry awakens in the woods surrounded by more mercs. They get quickly killed off by Hippie Jimmy. Henry follows him and another woman until they get killed by an explosion. Henry faces MORE MERCS, including a few riding a tank through the woods. He slices his way through them before killing some mercs in a chopper.Henry arrives at the apartment building where Jimmy's laboratory is located. First he comes across some dirty cops attempting to rape a woman. Henry shoots two of the cops before squeezing the last one's crotch like a grape and then shoving a shotgun barrel down his throat. Henry enters Jimmy's lab and sees a video of Jimmy working with Akan to create his cyborg army from the remains of deceased men. When the experiment went wrong, Akan crippled Jimmy by shattering his spine. The original Jimmy rolls in and shows off his clones to Henry through a rehearsed dance routine. Punk Jimmy then accuses Henry of being a traitor because he is involuntarily broadcasting his whereabouts to Akan. Original Jimmy decides to trust Henry and make sure that Akan doesn't get anywhere near the lab.Three of the clones (Punk, Camouflage, and Colonel) lead Henry outside to face the onslaught of mercs heading toward the building. Henry and Camouflage snipe some of the mercs down below while Punk gets some kills from the ground before getting blown up. Camouflage leaves Henry to join the Colonel as he drops himself down with a grenade. Henry and Colonel shoot and blow up some mercs. Yuri and his mercs arrive, but Colonel kills them by blowing up the ceiling and bringing it down on them. Jimmy has been hit with a shard in his jugular. Knowing he's dying, he tells Henry that he had seen him originally before he had woken up and noticed a memory block in his head and had it left in there, but he knows that some of his memories are returning. Before dying, he says it's good to have had Henry as a friend, and asks him to make sure he looks into Akan's eyes as he kills him.Henry makes it to Akan's facility for the final showdown. Akan has his cyborgs ready to go. He reveals to Henry that all of them woke up the same way Henry did, with Estelle claiming to be their wife and acting as though she loved them, including Henry. Akan unleashes the cyborgs upon Henry. He proceeds to kill them in every which way imaginable (shooting, stabbing, slashing, grenades, heads blown off, sliced off, eyes gouged out, etc.) Henry makes it to the roof to face Akan, but he is taken down by Akan's powers, and even harder when Estelle shows up, clearly on Akan's side. Akan taunts Henry as he's down and knocks him to the side, where he faces some glass and we get a vague look at Henry's face, which is similar to that of his father's.We see the childhood flashback again. Henry's father says his own father used to call him a pussy, and he feels he proved him right by killing the wrong people, but he vows to call Henry by his own name and tells him to fight back. In the present, Henry grabs two adrenaline needles and continues killing the rest of the cyborgs. He ties barbed wire around his hand and manages to get close enough to Akan to hurt him. He splits Akan's hand apart painfully. Akan uses his powers to lift Henry up, but Henry gets close again and pulls out his own eye stalk to wrap it around Akan's head and sever the top half off.Henry boards the chopper and shows off Akan's head to Estelle. She furiously shoots at Henry until he holds his hand up, causing the bullet to ricochet and strike her. Estelle stumbles out of the chopper and hangs on. She pleads with Henry to listen to his heart. Apparently, his heart told him to close the door on her fingers and let her plummet to the ground below."

If they fail, they are transformed into an animal and released into the woods.—R. Byma Set in a dystopian, future, single people are sent to a hotel where they must find a partner in 45 days or get turned into a wild animal of their choice. David's wife has just left him, after 11 years of marriage, and he is sent the hotel. His chosen animal, should he not find a partner, is a lobster.—grantss In a dystopian society, David, whose wife has just left him, is sent to the hotel for singles in the country. The strict hotel rules are meant, in a clinical fashion, to foster love, as everyone in this society, straight or gay, is to be paired up romantically. There are harsh punishments for anyone breaking the rules. And like the others, if David does not find love at the hotel within forty-five days, he will be surgically transformed into the animal of his own choice - David's being a lobster - this transformation not meant to be a punishment but rather another opportunity to find love as another species. Bob, the dog that David brings to the hotel, was in fact David's brother in his human life. David will discover that his search for love is dependent on the other people at the hotel, each who has his or her own agenda in what to do if true love cannot be found within their time limit. Unaware of it upon his arrival at the hotel, David will also learn that there are a bunch of anarchists who live in the woods, many of those being escapees from the hotel. The anarchists do not tolerate coupling in any form within their group, except as a ruse whenever they need to assimilate themselves into city life. But as one cannot automatically turn on the emotional taps to find true love at the hotel, one cannot automatically turn those taps off if being among the anarchists.—Huggo Only a short period of forty-five days separates the chronically unattached and the recently single from a swift and inescapable transformation into one's preferred animal, in a bleak dystopia where the laws of attraction are a matter of life or death. Inevitably, as the freshly dumped architect, David, enters the luxurious rehabilitation facility--the Hotel--he, too, has to find a suitable mate or a dangerously insecure future into the wild awaits. There, a new set of rules govern the seditious individuals who chose personal liberty over serious commitment; however, what happens if love creeps into the otherwise impregnable community of self-exiled loners?—Nick Riganas Set in the near future in what is presumably Ireland, the film opens with a woman driving down a road until she reaches a field with two small donkeys. She gets out of her car and shoots one of the donkeys until it is dead.We meet David (Colin Farrell) as he checks into the Hotel with his brother, who has been turned into a dog. In the City, people are given 45 days to find a romantic partner or else they are to be turned into an animal of their choice. David meets with the Hotel Manager (Olivia Colman) and says he would like to be turned into a lobster since they live to be 100 years.During breakfast, David observes three women - the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who is said to have no emotions; the Biscuit Woman (Ashley Jensen), who is always seen with a small pack of biscuits; and the Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden). David becomes acquainted with two men - Robert (John C. Reilly), who speaks with a lisp; and John (Ben Whishaw), who walks with a limp. Later, during an assembly, John is called up to speak. He says that his father left his mother for another woman, and so she was turned into a wolf and brought to live in a zoo. He would visit her enclosure until he climbed in to give her a hug. The other wolves attacked him, leaving him with his limp, but two wolves stayed still, and he figured one of them was his mother.Throughout their stay, the singles attend dances to meet one another. They are also given extra time by going on hunts and finding ""Loners"" in the woods to tranquilize. The Heartless Woman is said to be the best hunter due to her cold and unfeeling nature. On the bus ride to the hunt, David sits next to the Biscuit Woman, who propositions him and then says she may jump out the window of her room.Masturbation is restricted at the hotel, and so the men can only receive moderate sexual stimulation (without orgasm) from the Maid (Ariane Labed). The Hotel Manager finds out that Robert was masturbating repeatedly, and she forces him to have his fingers burnt in a toaster as punishment. Meanwhile, John pursues the Nosebleed Woman by faking a nosebleed problem by banging his face against something. They eventually fall in love and are moved to a bigger room for the two of them.The Biscuit Woman jumps out her window and is left on the ground, bleeding and screaming in agony. David approaches the Heartless Woman and makes brash comments regarding the Biscuit Woman's demise. They then go into a jacuzzi together. The Heartless Woman pretends to choke on an olive from her martini and when David doesn't try to help her, she decides they are a good match. The two are then moved into the bigger bedroom, though David must continue pretending to be as heartless as she is. They run into John and the Nosebleed Woman, along with a little girl named Elizabeth (Laoise Murphy) assigned to be their daughter. John tells Elizabeth to give David a kiss, but he responds by kicking her in the shin so she can limp like her dad.One morning, the Heartless Woman tells David she killed his brother by kicking him repeatedly. She has blood on her leg. David pretends to be unmoved, but when he sees the dead dog in the bathroom, he starts crying, and the Heartless Woman slaps him for lying. She goes to tell the Hotel Manager, but, with help from the Maid, David tranquilizes the Heartless Woman and drags her into the transformation room to be turned into an unknown animal.David flees from the Hotel and goes into the woods where he meets a group of Loners; a rebel group against the establishment. The Loner Leader (Lea Seydoux) welcomes David, but tells him that any romantic interaction is forbidden and is punishable. David sees one man with bandages on his mouth. He is told that the man was given ""the red kiss"", in which he had his lips cut off, along with another woman who suffered the same fate, and they were forced to kiss each other. The worse punishment is said to be ""the red intercourse"", which one can only imagine as to how it goes.During his stay there, David falls for the Short-Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) (who narrates her encounters with David). He wins her over by catching and killing rabbits, and then cooking them in a way specific to her liking. David also encounters Robert, who wants to shoot him and bring him back to the Hotel, but the Short-Sighted Woman knocks him out.The Loners take weekly trips into the city pretending to be couples. David is paired with the Short-Sighted Woman, and they are able to go by as a real couple without trouble. It is also revealed that the Maid is working with the Loner Leader and gathering information from the Hotel.One night, the Loners break into the Hotel while David boards a yacht that John and his new family are in. David tries to break them up, but neither of them want to hear what he has to say, and he leaves the yacht. In the Hotel, the Loner Leader goes into the room of the Hotel Manager and her husband. She holds the Manager at gunpoint and asks her husband if he loves her. He says yes, but when given a gun to shoot her, the husband pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. The Loners leave the two alone.The Loner Leader notices how close David and the Short-Sighted Woman have become. She then discovers the woman's journal and reads about her plan to escape with David into the City. The Loner Leader and the Maid take the Short-Sighted Woman into the City to have an operation that they claim will cure her vision, but in reality, they have her blinded. The woman is left to defend herself with a knife, which the other two women try to take away from her, but the woman stabs the Maid and leaves her to die.The Short-Sighted Woman eventually tells David about what the Loner Leader did to her. He is unsettled, but decides that he wants to stay with her, and helps her out with her other senses of touch and smell.Later, David attacks the Loner Leader and ties her up.

Munni gets accustomed to being part of the household. A couple of incidents in the following days lead to the revealing that Munni is in fact, a Pakistani Muslim.

Trumbo,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203606/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1947,Dalton Trumbowas Hollywood's top screenwriter, until he and other artists were jailed and blacklisted for their political beliefs. In 1947, Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was Hollywood's top screenwriter until he and other artists were jailed and blacklisted for their political beliefs. This movie recounts how Dalton used words and wit to win two Academy Awards and expose the absurdity and injustice under the blacklist, which entangled everyone from gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Dame Helen Mirren) to John Wayne (David James Elliott), Kirk Douglas (Dean O'Gorman), and Otto Preminger (Christian Berkel).—Bleecker Street The rise of Communism in the United States in the 1930s was a reaction to the Nazi uprising. However, Communism, in the late 1940s following World War II, is now seen as being a plague to American democracy with the on-set of the Cold War, with Communists automatically viewed as working for the Soviets. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) focused much of its attention toward flushing out Communists within the Hollywood movie industry as being high profile, celebrated author and ScreenwriterDalton Trumbo(Bryan Cranston), who has often spoken on the rights of workers, especially within the industry, being one of the primary targets as being a known card-carrying Communist. Dalton, and who would be coined the ""Hollywood 10"", have their own tactics, not only dealing with the subpoenas to appear before the HUAC where they are to admit being card-carrying Communists, and to name names of others of who the HUAC may not be aware, but in how they can avoid answering the questions and not be charged with contempt and subsequently imprisoned, all in protection of their First Amendment rights. Their tactics are against the high powered assistance of some in the Hollywood community, arguably most powerfully anti-Communist gossip columnistHedda Hopper(Dame Helen Mirren), who mobilizes the public through her column. The Hollywood 10 plan does not quite work out the way they had mapped it, which includes being blacklisted to prevent working for any American movie studio, effectively ruining their livelihoods. In response to the blacklist, Dalton comes up with a ""black"" plan of his own to regain his livelihood and that of the other blacklisted screenwriters: sell screenplays on somewhat of a black market, they obviously not receiving screen credit for any of their work. Dalton's subsequent plan to destroy the blacklist has the unanticipated consequence of what had been the unwavering support of his loyal wife Cleo (Diane Lane), and their children, most specifically oldest daughter Niki (Elle Fanning), who always wanted to be just like her dad.—Huggo The movie starts in the year 1947 with Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) in his bathtub, writing a script on a typewriter. At this point in time, he is an established screenwriter in Hollywood. We next see Trumbo on set as the film he wrote is shot. He attends a party with Edward G. Robinson (Michael Stuhlbarg). Trumbo goes to the movies and watches a film reel where gossip columnist, Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), speaks of many in Hollywood being Communists, showing Trumbo as an example; the House Un-American Activities Committee has been formed to investigate. After the film is over, a patron recognizes Trumbo and throws his soda at him.Back at his ranch, Dalton's young daughter Niki asks him if he's a Communist. He tells her it's not against the law and he simply wants a better government. He gives her the analogy if she saw someone at school who didn't have a lunch, would she share hers or tell the student to get a job? Dalton and others, including Arlen Hird (Louis C.K.) meet with Edward G. Robinson at his mansion; they discuss the scare tactics Congress is stirring up. At a meeting for the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, John Wayne gives a speech vilifying the Commies and declaring that they need to answer some questions. Arlen and Trumbo hand out pamphlets on free speech but John Wayne argues with them and ostentatiously tears one up while Hedda Hopper looks on. Trumbo points out that he served in the military but John Wayne hasn't - the closest experience he had was on a film set, wearing makeup. Hedda Hopper hints that she will put the exchange in her next column.Trumbo goes to MGM Studios and meets with Louis B. Mayer who tells him that his next deal is going to make him the highest paid writer in Hollywood. But Mayer points out Trumbo has been featured in Hedda Hopper's new column and says he doesn't want to see an article like that again. Trumbo suggests he stop reading Hedda Hopper.Trumbo and his friends and family gather at his ranch. They mention Trumbo's record-breaking, three-year contract with MGM. Trumbo's wife, Cleo (Diane Lane), demonstrates her juggling skills at her daughter's urging. We learn she was an acrobat as a child. The party is interrupted by a man who serves a subpoena to Trumbo, suggesting he and others in Hollywood are using the movies to corrupt democracy and overthrow the nation. We see some news reels of the hearings, then hear Trumbo and the others deciding to answer questions ambiguously. Some worry this will be contempt of court but someone else points out that they can appeal and the Supreme Court will side with them there's a five to four liberal majority who will agree the Committee is unconditional. In court, Trumbo is one of ten forced to testify along with Arlen, who is hesitant and can't afford the legal fees. Trumbo offers to cover him.In the U.S. Capitol, the hearings take place. Trumbo is defiant of the questioning, pointing out he hasn't been accused of a crime. Arlen follows suit, responding to questions with humor. Outside, Arlen admits to Trumbo he has recently found out he has lung cancer. The Hollywood 10 that testified are charged with contempt of Congress. At MGM, Hedda Hopper meets with Louis B. Mayer. She threatens to name him as a supporter if he doesn't fire Trumbo and the others, reminding him of her days as an actress when he tried to force her to have sex with him. Cut to Louis B. Mayer announcing he is dissolving ties to any of the Hollywood 10 under contract at MGM.At Edward G. Robinson's mansion, he collects money for a defense fund for the Hollywood 10. Trumbo realizes Robinson has sold one of his paintings to help fund the cause. The group is found guilty of contempt of Congress. Trumbo's lawyer tells the press the Supreme Court will side with his defendant. Privately, Trumbo admits he is now broke since his three-year contract was annulled the defense is going to cost him $90,000. Trumbo gets to work writing a new screenplay. Buddy Ross, a Hollywood producer, agrees to produce the films Trumbo is writing, independently, as soon as the court case finishes. Trumbo asks him if he would ever name names if he was on trial for being a Democrat Buddy says he wouldn't.Trumbo continues to write but just can't put his own name on his work. He instead gives the credit to Ian McLellan Hunter (Alan Tudyk) and asks him to sell it to the studio in exchange for 30 percent of the payout. The script he's written is Roman Holiday. Meanwhile, contractors are working on the ranch; one mentions to Cleo that they haven't been paid. Right then, Trumbo enters, declaring that he and Cleo are rich - Roman Holiday just sold to Paramount. Cleo is distracted though because one of the liberal judges on the Supreme Court has died, right after another liberal Supreme Court judge. There now is no longer a liberal majority and their appeal is going to be denied, securing the prison sentence that they were given.Trumbo reports to prison for his one-year sentence. He does his best to get along with other prisoners but feels very out of place. Outside, Edward G. Robinson is being questioned at the U.S. Capitol about whether or not he had political meetings attended by Communists at his home. He is asked to name names and Edward does, naming many including Arlen Hird and Dalton Trumbo. Unknown to him, Hopper contemptuously still wants Edward kept on the blacklist regardless of his cooperation, but John Wayne is outraged at this potential double cross for someone he felt did the right thing and successfully demands Hopper to now leave Edward alone.Time goes by. Trumbo feels some measure of satisfaction as he finds J. Parnell Thomas (James DuMont), the senator who interrogated him so harshly at the congressional hearings, a fellow prisoner after being convicted of tax evasion. We see news footage of the Rosenberg espionage trial, where a couple is found guilty of selling atomic secrets to Russia. And of Joseph McCarthy focusing on uncovering Communists in the United States. Trumbo is released from prison and reunites with his kids, who are now much older (Niki is now played by Elle Fanning). His house has been sold. Trumbo runs into Buddy Ross at a restaurant but Buddy blows him off.Arlen suggests they sue the studios but Trumbo suggests they instead make money by continuing to write screenplays. He visits Frank King (John Goodman) at King Brother Pictures, which creates B-movies. Frank says they can't afford him but Trumbo agrees to write screenplays at the same rate as other writers they've hired and will have it done in three days. Trumbo locks himself in the bathtub and bangs out a script. When the script is delivered, Frank loves it. He pays Trumbo and then asks Trumbo to fix other scripts they've had. Trumbo and his family move into a new home. A neighbor has written a note, calling him a traitor, and vandalizing his pool.Roman Holiday is a huge hit. Trumbo continues banging out scripts for the King Brothers who want quantity over quality. He's overwhelmed by the demand so he gets Frank to hire Arlen Hird and Ian McLellan Hunter, who is now blacklisted despite getting an Oscar nomination for Roman Holiday (which Trumbo actually wrote). Trumbo asks his family for their help in keeping the business going they will answer the phone and if they are asked for one of Trumbo's pseudonyms, he will take the call. They'll hand over scripts to messengers at their door based on what name they're under. And Cleo and Niki will make deliveries. Niki is concerned because she's consumed with schoolwork and civil rights projects.Frank King has issues with Arlen's script but assigns Dalton to fix it, despite him not getting paid for rewrites. Arlen is embarrassed to be writing crappy screenplays and keeps integrating political themes into his works. He points out that he was nominated for a Pulitzer and Trumbo won a National Book Award. Trumbo tells Arlen about an idea he has for a screenplay about a bullfighter. Later, the Oscars telecast is on and Roman Holiday wins Best Screenplay. Buddy Ross calls Trumbo at home and asks if it's true that he had actually written Roman Holiday he needs a script and wants to hire Trumbo. Arlen and Trumbo argue, with Trumbo saying if they continue to work despite being blacklisted, they win. Arlen saying he wants to make changes, not just get money and accolades.Jumping forward in time, it's now Niki's 16th birthday. Trumbo is locked in the bathroom, working on a script. Niki tries to get him to come downstairs for cake and he yells at her for interrupting him while he is working. She runs off in tears. Cleo comforts her as she complains about her father.Dalton finds out Arlen has finally died from the cancer. Trumbo attends the funeral, then visits Edward G. Robinson to tell him the news. His walls are now adorned with paintings. Trumbo wants to repay the money Edward gave them for their defense fund, so they're not indebted to him (after he named their names). Edward explains he just wanted his life back. Dalton tells him he didn't have to give names since Congress had no right to demand it of him. Edward tells him he probably shaved years off Arlen's life by forcing him to commit contempt against Congress. In a restaurant, Hedda Hopper approaches Trumbo. She asks him to solidify the rumor that he's been writing popular screenplays under false names. He refuses to give her an exclusive. Hedda reveals that Buddy Ross named names behind closed doors, including Trumbo's.Trumbo asks his son to deliver a script to a film set in Agoura, 50 miles away. Niki points out Chris has a date that night. Trumbo suggests Niki does it instead but she is going to be protesting racial segregation. He is adamant she deliver the script first; she refuses and rushes off. Trumbo then forces Chris to abandon his plans to go to the movies. Niki doesn't come out that night.Cleo tells Trumbo that when she was younger, she chose Trumbo over another boyfriend because that other boyfriend would have been an abusive father. She tells Trumbo he's losing them, always barking orders after returning from prison instead of talking to them like he used to. He is defensive and she tells him she won't let anybody bully their children. Trumbo finds Niki at a protest. He apologizes for being so aggressive but lately he's wired just to fight. Niki says she always wanted to be just like her father; Trumbo says she is. She forgives him.The IASTE Union Leader, Roy Brewer, visits Frank King and tells him he knows hes employing Trumbo and other Communists. He threatens to expose the King Brothers, which would result in protests and boycotts. Frank responds by picking up a baseball bat and smashing things, telling Roy he isn't afraid of boycotts; all of his movies are garbage. He says he is in film for the money and the pussy and if Roy takes that away from him, he won't sue him but he'll beat him to death with the bat. Roy runs off. Trumbo arrives with a new script, The Brave One, using his bullfighter idea. He explains to Frank that it's too good to be made on the cheap.Months later, the film comes out and the family goes to see it although it's credited as being written by Robert Rich. Later, the screenplay is nominated for an Academy Award. But unlike Roman Holiday, which was accredited to his friend, there is no Robert Rich to get the credit if it wins. And it does. Hedda Hopper storms the Motion Picture Alliance Offices and demands Roy Brewer tells her who Robert Rich is, hoping it's not who she thinks it is. Journalists interview Trumbo, asking if he's Robert Rich. He is ambiguous in response. Kirk Douglas comes to visit, asking if Trumbo can work on the script of his new movie. He does, it's called Spartacus and credited to Sam Jackson. Hedda meets with Kirk and threatens to send him to court if he hired Dalton Trumbo. Kirk says he doesn't like the way things are and isn't scared of Hedda.Otto Preminger, the director, has read Trumbo's Spartacus script and wants to hire him to write Exodus for Paul Newman to star in. He waits impatiently during Christmas morning, forcing Trumbo to write pages of the script. He doesn't like the work and says if he keeps it up, he'll put Trumbo's real name on the script to shame him. More new pages and Otto demands the work be more genius. Trumbo says if every scene is is brilliant, the work will be monotonous. Otto tells him to write every scene brilliant and he'll direct unevenly. Kirk visits and asks for some new revisions on the Spartacus script. Trumbo can't begin working on it again for another week. He tells Kirk that Otto said that if he keeps up that level of work, he'll see to it that his name is on the movie twisting his words to make it seem like Otto might give him a screen credit. He then tells Otto that Kirk came by and they discussed him getting a screen credit on Spartacus.On the set of Spartacus, the head of Universal tells Kirk that Hedda Hopper is predicting a boycott unless they fire Trumbo. Meanwhile, the King Brothers have several lawsuits against them from writers claiming that they are Robert Rich and wrote The Brave One. In order to settle the cases, they have to reveal Trumbo was the real writer. Niki points out that the neighbor that had called Trumbo a traitor upon moving in has seen Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger visit and has already figured out Trumbo is writing all of these scripts with mysterious writers. Trumbo will legally be tied to the film and will receive the Oscar. Trumbo admits that he is Robert Rich to a news reporter. He uses this as an opportunity to point that the House Un-American Activities Committee has yet to expose any Communist conspiracies or write any laws yet invested millions of dollars in their investigation. The only thing they've accomplished is keeping people from working. Yet he still managed to win two Academy Awards. Trumbo is able to use this interview to turn public opinion against the blacklist. In response, Otto announces his new film is written by Dalton Trumbo. Kirk also demands that the head of Universal announce Trumbo wrote their screenplay, as well. When he refuses, Kirk threatens to leave the film despite already having shot half the movie (meaning those millions of dollars would have been wasted).Right before its release, Hedda threatens a mass protest of Spartacus unless Trumbo's name is removed. When the Universal head refuses, she threatens it will be the end of his studio. Nonetheless, the film premieres with Trumbo's name in the credits. Cleo begins to cry, stating that it's all over now (i.e., the blacklisting). President John F. Kennedy is asked about his thoughts on Spartacus and the controversy. He responds that he thinks it's going to be a big hit, indirectly supporting Trumbo and denouncing the blacklist. Hedda Hopper, at home, glares at the television, humiliated at her defeat.In March 1970, Dalton Trumbo is given the Writers' Guild of America's Laurel Award. In his speech, he notes that the blacklist was a time of evil but people shouldn't think of the people involved as heroes or villains but every single one of them, victims.Title cards say that Trumbo received his Oscar for The Brave one in 1975, and died a year later at age 70. Cleo accepted an Oscar awarded posthumously for Roman Holiday in 1993, and she died in 2009. Hundreds of Hollywood names were blacklisted, and thousands more unfairly targeted. Teachers, soldiers, government workers and their families suffered terrible losses including suicides. The House Un-American Activities committee continued their investigations until 1975."

Juggling some angry Russians, the British Mi5, his impossibly leggy wife and an international terrorist, debonair art dealer and part-time rogue Charlie Mortdecai must traverse the globe armed only with his good looks and special charm in a race to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain the code to a lost bank account filled with Nazi gold.—Lionsgate UK Lord Charlie Mortdecai, an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler, is accosted in Hong Kong by one of his victims, a gangster named Fang. Jock, Mortdecai's faithful manservant, extricates his master before they can be killed by Fang's gunmen. They return to London, where Mortdecai and his wife, Johanna, consider ways to pay off their crushing debt to the UK taxman. A painting by Francisco Goya becomes the target of an elaborate theft which results in the murders of an art restorer and one of the thieves. Inspector Alistair Martland is put on the case. Martland, who has been in love with Johanna since college, asks Mortdecai to assist him. Martland believes the prime suspect to be Emil Strago. Mortdecai agrees to help in exchange for 10% of the insurance money.. Lord Charlie Mortdecai, a dubiously-reputed but expert art wheeler and dealer counting on his devoted manservant Jock to save his bacon with swindled or criminal clients, is near bankruptcy due to US taxes, so prepares his aristocratic wife Johanna to selling off some heirlooms from their grand residence. That gets her even less in the mood to put up with his freshly grown 'ancestral' mustache, all to more to flirt with rival admirer Alistair Martland, an MI5 agent counting on Charlie as art expert, hence looking away from his shady deals. This time he must verify the rare Goya painting stolen from the murdered restorer Georgina and follow the fencing trail, promised a 10% insurance fee. It leads him to his reputable competitor Sir Graham, Russian oligarch Romanov's goons abducting Mortdecai perilously to Moscow, the best smuggler to the US, and obscenely rich, dirty client Krampf's Californian playpen, and Johanna to a dying duke's grand estate.—KGF Vissers Lord Charlie Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) is an eccentric English art dealer with a curly mustache. He is at a casino in Hong Kong meeting with a gangster named Fang (Junix Inocian) to sell a rare vase. Mortdecai is about to collect the money when Fang reminds him that during their last transaction, Mortdecai sold him a piece of art for $3 million when it was only worth $1 million. As payback, Fang wants to collect one of Mortdecai's fingers. One of Fang's men tries to do the job when Mortdecai's faithful manservant/thug Jock (Paul Bettany) steps in and beats the goon. A shootout ensues, forcing Mortdecai and Jock to flee.Recently, Mortedcai and his wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) have come into debt. After returning to his home in London, Johanna sees the mustache her husband has grown and she is utterly repulsed by it, gagging whenever he kisses her (and making him gag in response as he has a sympathetic gag reflex). She ponders what they will do about their financial concerns. Here, we learn how much Mortdecai loves his wife, and he also mentions a bit about Jock, specifically how much sex he has and how it's got him in hot water (i.e., sleeping with a farmer's daughter).A woman named Bronwen (Norma Atallah) is working on a painting by Goya when she is shot in the back with an arrow. After Bronwen expires, a thief swipes the painting and leaves her home, when he is knocked out by yet another thief.Inspector Alistair Martland (Ewan McGregor) is put on the investigation to recover the painting. He visits Mortdecai to ask for his services. Martland has been in love with Johanna since their college years, and he harbors a slight vendetta against Mortdecai after catching them sleeping together. He informs Mortdecai and Johanna of the theft, with their prime suspect being a criminal named Emil Strago (Jonny Pasvolsky), and he convinces Mortdecai to recover the painting with Jock, to which they agree on the condition of receiving 10% in payment after they plan on selling the painting to an American dealer by the name of Milton Krampf.Mortdecai first visits an art aficionado named Sir Graham (Michael Culkin) to get a clue as to where the painting may be. Then he visits an art smuggler named Spinoza (Paul Whitehouse) in a garage. Spinoza has apparently also been screwed over by Mortdecai in the past, as he angrily yells and swears at the man. Emil shows up and shoots at the men. Spinoza is killed, while Mortdecai and Jock take one of the cars and drive away.While her husband is away, Johanna does a bit of investigating on her own.She meets with a man known as The Duke (Michael Byrne), who informs her that the painting was taken by a friend of his from the war. It supposedly has codes written on the back that lead to the location of a hidden stash of Nazi gold.Mortdecai learns that the painting was stashed in the car that he was driving. A while later, he is kidnapped by Russian thugs working for a man named Romanov (Ulrich Thomsen). They want the painting too, and they threaten to electrocute Mortdecai's balls until Mortdecai pushes one of the thugs out the window along with himself to escape with Jock. After returning to London, Martland forces Mortdecai to go on ahead to America to meet with Milton Krampf.Mortdecai and Jock arrive in Los Angeles where the former meets Krampf (Jeff Goldblum) and his apparently nymphomaniac daughter Georgina (Olivia Munn). The painting has been selected for a gallery to be on display for a party later on. Jock proposes that they sneak into the room where it's being kept and swipe the painting for themselves when nobody is looking. Mortdecai also gets in touch with Johanna and overhears Martland in the room with her, thinking she is unfaithful. He tries to convince her he is staying in a brothel out of spite.On the night of the party, Mortdecai is nearly seduced by Georgina, until he is caught dancing with her (and with his hand on her breast) by Johanna, who has also shown up with Martland. Mortdecai leaves and goes to take the painting with Jock.They find Krampf has been murdered by Emil, who has nabbed the painting. Martland and Johanna come in with Martland aiming a gun at Emil. However, it turns out Georgina is in cahoots with Emil, and they are also lovers. They take the painting and run for it, with the other four chasing after them. The villains go to a motel and try to find the codes with lighter fluid and a blowtorch. In the chaos, Martland purposefully ignites the lighter fluid with a lighter, which ignites a conveniently placed pile of petrol. Everybody runs as the motel room explodes, destroying the painting with it.Johanna informs Mortdecai that this painting was a fake. The real one is with The Duke, which he actually did tell her when he invited Johanna to look at it in the bathroom (she thought he was talking about showing her his penis). The couple return to London to find The Duke, only to learn that he has passed away. His widow does allow them to go to the bathroom and find the painting.The couple puts the painting up for an auction later that evening, hidden as a fake under a familiar painting owned by Mortdecai. Fang is informed of this and goes down to collect Mortdecai's finger. Romanov and his goons also show up to the auction with Sir Graham. Mortdecai and Jock subdue Romanov's goons before encountering Fang's goons. Those two nearly take one of Jock's fingers instead, until Mortdecai takes a club and beats them down to save his friend. Mortdecai runs to the auction, where Emil has been seated next to Johanna with a knife. Mortdecai arrives and makes a high bid until Romanov outbids him. The painting is sold to him, giving Johanna a moment to pepper-spray Emil in the face, and he is apprehended by Martland.We learn that Romanov purchased the wrong fake, and he decides to have Sir Graham's balls. Martland accepts that he will never be with Johanna, and he leaves her be. Mortdecai has collected some money, but the rest is paid off for taxes he skipped.In the end, Mortdecai and Johanna continue to love each other and remain faithful through thick and thin. He agrees to finally shave his mustache if it will make her happy, because he would do anything for her. Johanna decides to let it stay. She kisses him passionately, until moments later when she gags, forcing Mortdecai to follow suit."

Beyond the unexpected house guest to replace Hazel, Carol embarks on two very different relationships with two very different men, each who fulfills a different void in her life: Bill Young, a new resident at Royals Oaks, he who is seemingly self-assured but all alone in the world; and Lloyd, her new pool man who is half her age, and to any outsider a person who is floundering in life in not knowing what he wants and thus not making any real efforts to move ahead.—Huggo The film begins with Carol (Blythe Danner) waking-up in a bed which used to hold two people. Now her only bedmate is her elderly dog. Soon she is the only one occupying the bed. When she sees a rat in her house, she sleeps outside by the pool. The next morning Lloyd the pool guy (Martin Starr) wakes her. They form a bond and he takes her out Karaokeing - a new adventure. Soon Carol is back spending her day, like all days, playing cards with her friends: other elderly women living in a nearby retirement village. She meets Bill (Sam Elliott) a widower who dates her thereby continuing to open her up to life. Carol's grown daughter comes to visit, learns about her mother's new adventures and is excited that her mother is beginning to live again. Bill dies before he and Carol can re-start life, this time with each other. But Lloyd re-enters her life, captures the rat and Carol sees that both of them need to move on and live for the future. If Carol was a teenager this would be a 'coming-of-age' film. But Carol is a widow in her 60's so it's a 'coming-to-terms-with-life' film. At the film's end, Carol gets a rescue dog to replace her earlier dog and moves on with life."

Our Brand Is Crisis,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1018765/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A battle-hardened American political consultant is sent to help re-elect a controversial president in Bolivia, where she must compete with a long-term rival working for another candidate. In 2002, Bolivian politician Pedro Gallo hires American James Carville's political consulting firm, Greenberg Carville Shrum, to help him win the 2002 Bolivian presidential election. GCS brings in Jane Bodine to manage the campaign in Bolivia--battling her arch-nemesis, the opposition's political consultant Pat Candy.—Gerry Garcia Washed-up political strategist Jane Bodine is hired by a political consultancy to help their client, Senator Castillo, win the Bolivian general election. Bodine used to be the best in the game, but an unfortunate series of events during a campaign destroyed her reputation and confidence. What sealed the deal was that she will be coming up against her long-time arch-nemesis, Pat Candy.—grantss Senator Pedro Castillo, President of Bolivia 15 years ago, is once again running for the country's top job. At the start of the campaign, which he's hired an American consulting firm to run, he is 28 points behind in the polls and running sixth in the crowded field, he, a globalist, largely seen by the indigenous poor majority, representing approximately 50 percent of the population, as being an elitist, out of touch with their needs and thus generally disliked as a personality. The front-runner, Victor Rivera, is a populist who is appealing to the basest emotions of that poor electorate. Castillo's American consultants, knowing that they need ideas outside the box, recruit ""retired"" political strategist ""Calamity"" Jane Bodine, who has lived somewhat off the grid and has not worked on a political campaign in six years. Although she was once a wunderkind of the political strategy community, she lost her last four campaigns, the speculation that being the reason she dropped out of sight. Once a political idealist, she increasingly was a strategist for hire outwardly not caring about the actual politics of her boss. Beyond needing to adjust to her relocation to La Paz however temporary, Jane knows that she has to transform the thinking of the populace to making them want Castillo as their leader as opposed to changing Castillo to something he inherently is not. She may get some help in getting into the mindset of that indigenous poor through a campaign volunteer named Eddie, a Castillo loyalist since he was a young boy much to the chagrin of his friends. Jane also has to get Castillo to be totally transparent to her to uncover those skeletons that she might need to deal with, being transparent which he may not be willing to be, not realizing that her own skeletons might pop out to play. What makes the campaign more personal for her is that Pat Candy is working for Rivera--their professional and personal history goes all the way back to her first-ever political campaign.—Huggo The film starts with Jane Bodine (Sandra Bullock) being interviewed. The interviewer says shes been known by many names, most notably Calamity Jane. She will work on the campaign of anybody, provided the money is right. It is revealed that she retired after violating election laws. The rest of the movie is her telling the story of what happened after her resignation.Ben (Anthony Mackie) and Nell (Ann Down) are driving in the snowy mountains (between the mountains, as Jane later corrects them) discussing their plan to sway Jane to work for the campaign of Pedro Castillo, a Senator in Bolivia who is running for President. He is currently 28 points behind. Arriving at Janes house, she explains she has quit smoking and drinking and has focused on pottery. There are dozens of pottery jars and bowls covering the walls. Ben admires a shiny dark bowl but Nell takes it from him.Nell explains that Castillo's opponent, Rivera, has hired her old arch nemesis, Pat Candy (played by Billy Bob Thornton).A screenshot shows Castillo at 8% with Rivera leading with 36%. Several candidates separate the two.Jane has accepted the offer and their plane lands in La Paz, Bolivia, which has an elevation of nearly 12,000 feet above sea level. She is unable to breath and is using an oxygen mask on the car ride to campaign headquarters. She meets the campaign team but stays in the background at the first meeting, clearly feeling ill. The campaign advisors are telling Castillo he needs to meet with the people and be seen as one of the people. Jane is so nauseous from her travel and the elevation she leaves and is heard throwing up.Ben meets her in the hallway and she immediately says hes not a winner, and he cannot win.Later at her hotel room, she is still nauseous from the elevation.Castillo and the campaign team are on the outdoor set of a commercial for the Senator. An young actress expresses concern with her part in the ad, which requires her to be caught by Castillo. She doesn't believe hell catch her and he expresses disbelief. Jane is on the set but is only seen in the background on a lounge chair, still looking unwell. A senior advisor expresses dismay that she has been hired but all shes doing is sunning herself.During a focus group for the ad in which he catches and holds up several people, its clear the ad does not resonate with anybody. One woman says he has a weird smile. Castillo is frustrated and wants to hear what Jane has planned for the campaign. Jane expresses to Ben that she still gets nauseous whenever she sees Castillo.At a large debate with all the candidates, Jane is found behind the stage backdrop during the debate. She is approached by Candy, who tells her hes surprised shes working on an unwinnable campaign. She tells him shes going home tomorrow. He suggests maybe later they can go out.At an evening event, Castillo is shaking hands with people behind a barrier. A man in a mask jumps the barrier and smashes an egg on Castillo's forehead. Castillo immediately punches the man. A young man working on the campaign, Eduardo (Reynaldo Pacheco) comes to the rescue of Castillo and ushers him away. Candy can be seen watching the action in the background.Jane insists to the campaign team that this was set up by Candy. The campaign believes Castillo should apologize as soon as possible but Jane disagrees. She doesn't think the man should change to fit the narrative but instead the narrative should change to fit the man. She insists Castillo express regret, but not to apologize. Finally, she meets with Castillo for their first conversation. She describes the Daisy advertisement, which ran exactly once, that turned the election for Lyndon Johnson over Barry Goldwater. She tells Castillo and the campaign that this is no longer an election, it is a crisis. From that day on, she says, our brand is crisis.While Castillo is meeting with the press, Jane meets Eduardo. His name is too long with her so she just calls him Eddie. She gives him a bottle of Paul Newman Steak Sauce.Another screenshot shows Castillo has 10% to Riveras 39% with 80 days until election day.Jane wakes up in her hotel room. She needs a cigarette, so she walks out the door into a large open foyer. On a table she finds a Rivera doll. She looks across the large foyer to see Candy sitting outside his room. Later shell claim he got the room intentionally to get under her skin.Before a campaign stop, Jane tells Eddie to help Castillo roll up his sleeves. After he does this, Castillo gives Eddie his cufflinks to hold, and it is clear Eddie idolizes him. Later, two senior advisors argue the crisis brand may have worked with the current crowd, but it wont with the working class.At another commercial set inside a warehouse, several llamas are there, and Castillo is set to compare the future of Bolivia with llamas, who work hard. Outside, a large groan is heard. One of the llamas is hit by a truck. Jane says the llama cant stand the commercial so badly, he killed himself.At another meeting with advisors, its revealed the crisis message is working, but not so well that it will win the election. Jane says its time to go negative. She introduces LeBlanc (Zoe Kazan), a young investigator who is hired to dig up dirt on Rivera. Jane suggests that Castillo reveal everything that could be used against him, but he refuses. When Jane leaves the meeting with LeBlanc, she instead instructs her to dig up dirt on Castillo, their own candidate. Walking into the room with the campaign team, she gives a fiery and inspirational speech about how important it is to go negative, and that anybody with a problem with that will be given a set of balls. There is only one wrong thing to do, she says: Losing. She then asks who knows English and only a handful of people raise their hands, so LeBlanc must translate.LeBlanc discovers Rivera has purchased 27 vehicles with taxpayer money at the cost of about 35-40 vehicles. He is a crook. Jane gets a call from Pat who tells her to turn on the TV. Rivera is on, holding two babies during a campaign stop, confessing how hes doubly lucky, and promises to run a positive campaign. Jane insist they go negative in spite of this, but Castillo says no.LeBlanc finds even more dirt on Rivera, but Jane tells her to focus everything on finding dirt on Castillo.Fliers are discovered, authored by the La Paz Grassroots that say Castillo had a three year affair. Jane says that Pat Candy is behind the fliers. Castillo says its in the past, and that his wife knows about it, but Jane claims the perception will be that hes an adulterer. As a result of this, Castillo agrees to start running a negative campaign.Negative ads are now running for Castillos campaign. Candy calls Jane and invites her to go out again. She doesnt respond. Instead, both end up outside of their hotel rooms so they can see each other. Candy reveals it was him (via a friend of a friend) who anonymously suggested to the Castillo campaign to hire Jane.In the city, Eddie is hanging Castillo posters. An SUV carrying the Castillo advisors sees him and stop to give him a ride home, insisted upon by Jane. When they get home, his brothers ridicule Eddie for bringing Yankees and trusting them, and for that matter, trusting Castillo. The boys (all adult age) are living alone because their parents have both died. Jane invites them out to dinner with the campaign team. They are then in a restaurant, the entire campaign team drinking heavily.Back at the hotel room, Jane is with Eddie and his brothers, ordering room service and still drunk. They make a sling shot out of clothes and shoot something that splatters against Candys window across the foyer. They then shoot the head of the Rivera doll Candy had left, and it breaks his window. He calls the police and Jane is seen slapping an officer. She spends the night in jail.Jane meets with Castillo who says shes a liability. She reveals she has had mental issues before and suffered from depression. She offers to reluctantly resign, but Castillo keeps her on. Meanwhile, the senior advisors (Ben, Nell and others) talk about Jane and Candy, how they had sex previously, and how she spread a rumor during a campaign that Candys candidates daughter was on drugs. (The daughter killed herself as a result.)At a Rivera campaign stop, Jane is seen talking to Candy. Candy tells her he knows it was Jane who planted the fliers of Castillos infidelity in order to force Castillo to run a negative campaign. Its also revealed that Candy is the one who ran over the llama during the commercial shoot. While Rivera is still speaking aboard a train, Jane poses as a worker for the Rivera campaign and tells the conductor the speech is over. The train begins to leave and Candy is furious.A montage shows the crisis message is working and support for Castillo is growing.On a campaign bus heading toward a remote Bolivia location on a small dirt road, they discover Riveras bus is directly ahead of them. Jane wants to overtake it. A bus race ensues around dangerous bends and cliffs. Jane yells out the window to Candy that Rivera has dropped 6 points. She then offers money to the driver to overtake the Rivera bus. When it does, Jane moons the Rivera bus. Somebody on the Castillo bus says Jane has a great ass!More fliers are discovered that claim (with pictures) Castillo is a member of a crazy white-robe wearing cult. Like before, it came from La Paz Grassroots, but this time it really did come from Candy. To handle this scandal, Castillo is interviewed on TV and explains it was a visit to his son, who IS a member of the cult, and he had to wear the robe. He denies being a member of the cult. The interviewer talks about his son. Castillo had been coached by Jane that if he senses any emotion or tears, to look directly into the camera. He does exactly that, to Jane's delight, when explaining hes not close to his son, but he wishes he was, with tears in his eyes.A graphic shows with 24 days left until the election, Castillo has 19% and Rivera has 30%.Jane next starts a rumor that Rivera is a Nazi, based on no real facts, but a fuzzy picture showing him with Nazi propaganda. She explains its not relevant whether its true. She just needs to hear him deny it.On a bus trip to a mountainous countryside, protesters start throwing rocks at the bus. The villagers are angrily blocking the bus, and Castillo, against the wishes of Jane, gets off to talk with them. They plead with him that any negotiations with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) be preceded by a referendum so the people can decide. Castillo promises the people that will happen if hes elected.Back on the bus, Castillo explain to Eddie that an effective leader is a father to the people, and that sometimes a father must be strict. He says the people in the village don't understand that yet.In a restaurant, Jane sits alone until Candy sits next to her. He tells a story about a campaign run by Adlai Stevenson in which Stevenson is told everything thinking person would vote for him, to which Stevenson replies that is not enough. I need a majority. Candy goes on to tell Jane, If you fight with monsters too long, you become a monster. Jane later says that shell kill herself if she loses to Candy again (though this appears to be hyperbole) She has lost every election against him.Jane is talking with Nell, and insults her about her dedication to the campaign. She tells Nell she needs to pull some string with her contacts at the Bolivian State Department, in order to take votes from Castillo, and give them to Volasco (another candidate). The next scene shows the state department giving an anti-cocaine speech, which will help Volasco.Another graphic shows the race at 22% for Castillo and 26% for Rivera with 16 days to go.During a debate prep session, Castillo and Jane engage in a heated argument in which Jane says they are all just puppets in the political game, and that nobody is in charge. Castillo tells her she needs professional help for wanting to do anything to win.Right before the debate with the 3 leading candidates, Jane is sitting alone in the lecture hall, reading Faust by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe, and is soon joined by Candy. They talk about the book and Mephistopheles, with whom Faust makes a wager for his soul. Jane highlights something in the book. Not seeing what she highlighted, Candy asks about it. She quotes, It may be alright to have a power that is based on guns. However it is better and more gratifying to win the heart of a nation and keep it. Candy gives her a condescending compliment and tells her he plans to pleasure himself thinking about her when he returns home. Jane says it will be an honor.During the debate, Nell observes how charming Rivera is, while the team watches stage left. Rivera then repeats the quote Jane told Candy. Jane is elated and tells the communication team to talk to the press and inform them Rivera just used a quote from Joseph Goebbels, the head Nazi propaganda minister.Election day. Montage of the press reporting throughout the day. It is a record turnout and at days end, the results are: Castillo 23.5%, Rivera 22.8%, Volasco 21.9%. Castillo has won the election. Afterwards, Jane sends 3 Bolivian singers to show up at Candys door.Eddie is delivering a framed photograph to now President-Elect Castillo's Senate offices. He overhears him making plans to visit the IMF in New York, and is crestfallen. Later Castillo is heard instructing interest rates to be raised to 15%.Back at Jane's hotel, Ben calls and informs her there will be a protest downtown. A knock on the door reveals Eddie, saddened and angry, who tells her about the IMF plan. Jane tells him this is the way of politics, and its not her job to solve problems after the election. They make big promises that mean jack shit. Getting hurt is unavoidable, she tells him. Eddie replies, ""what about you? What are you going to do?"" and then leaves. Jane is seen having a moment of introspection.The protest is growing in the city. Candy is outside the hotel in his chauffeur-driven SUV and offers Jane, Ben, and Nell a ride to the airport. They reluctantly agree, but the city is in gridlock due to the protests, which are on the verge of becoming riots. Eddie and his brothers join the protests and are shouting angry chants.Before long the SUV comes to a stop in the heavy traffic on the tiny streets. Candy says he will be going to overseas for a British campaign. Others discuss plans but Jane is silent. She pulls from her bag the pottery bowl that Ben was admiring in the first scene, and hands it to him before climbing out of the car. Ben jumps out and yells, get in the car, what are you doing? They approach each other and she just smiles. Ben says, ok. Let me know how that goes. Jane then joins the mass of people who are walking toward the city.Cut back to the interview that opened the film. Jane says its just a carousel and she was going around and around. She finally just decided to get off the carousel. She is then seen in the middle of the protest, and sees Eddie. Eventually Eddie sees her and they make eye contact. Jane's voice is heard saying, ""If you don't like the road you're on, start paving a new one."""

Bajirao I, who fought over 41 major battles and several lesser ones, was reputed to have never lost any of them. Bajirao is described as ""RANMARD"" a man made of and for the battlefield. Bajirao told his brother ""Remember that night has nothing to do with sleep. It was created by God, to raid territory held by your enemy. The night is your shield, your screen against the cannons and swords of vastly superior enemy forces."" A born cavalry leader, Bajirao was unequaled for the daring and originality of his genius. Mastani, the fabled warrior princess, was the daughter of Raja Chattrasal and his Persian wife Roohani Begum. An expert dancer, singer, and warrior, Mastani is sent to battle at the head of the Bundelkhand army. A chance meeting on a battlefield where they fight on the same side puts Bajirao and Mastani on a course of passionate love that is unstoppable by their families, by war, or by death itself. In the 18th century, the court of Maratha Kingdom needs Peshwa and Bajirao is nominated. He wins everyone's hearts by his skills and becomes Peshwa, and years later he marries Kashibai. Going to war, a woman from Bundelkhand asks his help and reveals herself as Mastani, daughter of the Rajput king. Impressed by her skills, Bajirao helps her fight her enemies and gifts her his dagger during the Holi festival--not knowing that it's a symbol of marriage.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com In the early 18th century, the court of Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu (Mahesh Manjrekar) from Satara Empire a new Peshwa, the equivalent of a modern-day prime minister. In spite of Shripad Rao's (Aditya Pancholi) self-nomination as the Pant Pratinidhi, Ambaji Pant (Milind Soman) chooses to nominate a young Bajirao (Ranveer Singh). To test his spiritual wisdom and knowledge of weaponry, Shripad challenges Bajirao to split a peacock feather with an arrow. Bajirao succeeds and is given the title of Shrimant Peshwa. Ten years later, his wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu (Snehlata Girish Vasaikar), whose husband was accused of spying on Bajirao and hence was executed. She bitterly forebodes that just like she longs for her husband, Kashi, too, will yearn for Bajirao.While traveling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand infiltrates Bajirao's tent and demands his help in fighting invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of the Rajput King Chhatrasal (Benjamin Gilani) and his Persian queen, Ruhani Bai. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists that Bajirao spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao develop feelings for each other and he gifts her his dagger, which is a symbol of marriage among the Bundelkhand Rajputs. He soon departs for Pune, where Kashi greets him with a tour of their newly-built Shaniwar Wada and shows him the Aaina Mahal (hall of mirrors) which allows her to see him from her room.Determined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly by Bajirao's mother Radhabai (Tanvi Azmi) and accommodated in the palace for courtesans. She tolerates this insult and appears to dance before Bajirao on the occasion of Parava. Radhabai scornfully offers her the occupation of a royal dancer but refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani travels to the King and expresses her desire to be with Bajirao before leaving to wait for him at a ruin across the river. Bajirao crosses the river in the midst of a storm and chides her persistence, reminding her that he is already married and that his court will never respect her if she is with him. She agrees despite his warning and he declares her as his second wife.Bajirao leaves to confront the Nizam of Deccan (Raza Murad) and although his odds of victory are slim, he returns successful. A pregnant Kashi witnesses Bajirao embracing Mastani, who is also expecting, in the Aaina Mahal and leaves for her mother's home. She returns months later with her newborn son, who is named Raghunath in joyous celebration. Mastani also gives birth to a son, whom Mastani and Bajirao name Krishna Rao, but when Krishnaji Bhatt, the head Brahmin priest, refuses to conduct the NaamKaran (Hindu christening ceremony) and he is deemed illegitimate, Bajirao names him Shamsher Bahadur. A few years later, Kashi's eldest son Balaji Baji Rao (alias Nana Saheb, played by Ayush Tandon) returns from Satara and expresses hatred towards Mastani for disrupting his mother's marriage.Kashibai is informed of a treacherous plan to murder Mastani and her son during a festival by Shiva Bhatt, another Brahmin priest. Kashibai reluctantly relays this news to Bajirao, who rescues both of them from certain death. Following the murder of Shiva Bhatt by Krishnaji Bhatt, Bajirao is enraged. For Mastani's safety and to grant her a royal abode, Bajirao builds Mastani Mahal for her. Bajirao, however, is devastated due to the betrayal of Radhabai and Chiman Appa, when Pant informs him that he must defeat Nasir, the vengeful son of the Nizam. Bajirao proclaims that even if he loves Mastani, his life and allegiance is always to his cause, so he decides to enter the battlefield.After Bajirao leaves for battle, Radhabai and Nana Saheb imprison Mastani and Shamsher Bahadur. After Bajirao defeats Nasir all by himself, he receives news of this treachery and collapses from his injuries. Kashi pleads with Radhabai to release Mastani so that Bajirao can recover, but her attempt is futile as Balaji Baji Rao burns the letter and refuses to release Mastani. Bajirao, delirious due to his sickness, dies from the trauma of his hallucinations, just as Mastani passes away in captivity. The two fated lovers are shown to be united in death."

Irrational Man,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715320/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A tormented philosophy professor finds a will to live when he commits an existential act. A new philosophy professor arrives on a small town campus near Newport, Rhode Island. His name, Abe Lucas. His reputation : bad. Abe is said to be a womanizer and an alcoholic. But what people do not know is that he is a disillusioned idealist. Since he has become aware of his inability to change the world, he has indeed been living in a state of deep nihilism and arrogant desperation. In class, he only goes through the motions and outside he drinks too much. But as far as sex is concerned, he is just a shadow of himself now: depression is not synonymous with Viagra! For all that, he can't help being attracted to one of his students, pretty and bright Jill Pollard. He enters into a relationship with her which remains platonic, even if Jill would not say no to more. The situation remains unchanged for a while until, one day, in a diner, Abe and Jill surprise a conversation that will change the course of their lives dramatically...—Guy Bellinger The Philosophy Department of Braylin College in Rhode Island is about to welcome its newest lecturer, and the stories surrounding him are already legend. In additional to being an excellent lecturer on Philosophy and an author of many books, Abe Lucas has a colourful history as an activist, womaniser and lover of life. However, the Abe Lucas who arrives is no longer that energetic, positive person. He is now a depressed, empty shell of a man, and an alcoholic. Over time he befriends one of his students, Jill, and another lecturer, Rita, but even their friendship and obvious affection for him doesn't lift his spirits. Then, from a dark, unexpected source, he finds a reason to live...—grantss Abe Lucas, a Philosophy professor, has just started his tenure at Braylin College in Rhode Island. His reputation as a womanizer and loner genius precedes him. He, however, has become disillusioned with life as a whole, the manifestation of his feeling being that he is blocked mentally and physically, meaning that he is no longer writing and has not had sex in quite some time. He is only one step before thoughts of committing suicide, he having romanticized the notion of death. He, as a person, is, however, still able to attract people to himself sexually, two women at Braylin who make their interest known to him. The first is Chemistry professor Rita Richards, who is dissatisfied with her marriage. The second is Jill Pollard, one of his students who is already in a committed relationship with Roy, a fellow student. While Abe does succumb to Rita's advances however unsuccessfully, he is careful to keep his relationship with Jill as a platonic one, despite Jill's feelings for him being what, at her tender age, she may consider true love. While out with Jill, Abe stumbles upon thoughts of an act of existentialism. Carrying out that act, without telling anyone, ends up rejuvenating him and brings him back into the land of the living, in turn altering both his relationships with Rita and Jill. That act has some unintended consequences, which leads to him finding out how strong his instinct for survival is in his rejuvenated state.—Huggo"
The Man Who Knew Infinity,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the life and academic career of the pioneer Indian mathematician,Srinivasa Ramanujan, and his friendship with his mentor, Professor G.H. Hardy. In the 1910s, Srinivasa Ramanujan is a man of boundless intelligence that even the abject poverty of his home in Madras, India, cannot crush. Eventually, his stellar intelligence in mathematics and his boundless confidence in both attract the attention of the noted British mathematics professor, G.H. Hardy, who invites him to further develop his computations at Trinity College at Cambridge. Forced to leave his young wife, Janaki, behind, Ramanujan finds himself in a land where both his largely intuitive mathematical theories and his cultural values run headlong into both the stringent academic requirements of his school and mentor and the prejudiced realities of a Britain heading into World War One. Facing this with a family back home determined to keep him from his wife and his own declining health, Ramanujan joins with Hardy in a mutual struggle that would define Ramanujan as one of India's greatest modern scholars who broke more than one barrier in his worlds.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)"
Anomalisa,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401878/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man crippled by the mundanity of his life experiences something out of the ordinary. Michael Stone, an author that specializes in customer service, is a man who is unable to interact deeply with other people. His low sensitivity to excitement, and his lack of interest made him a man with a repetitive life on his own perspective. But, when he went on a business trip, he met a stranger - an extraordinary stranger, which slowly became a cure for his negative view on life that possibly will change his mundane life.—Gusde Michael Stone is a renowned motivational speaker and author, primarily on the topic of business customer relations. But Michael is not very motivated in his own life in that he is having problems relating to people, who all seem to be melding into one big mass of the same person, that big mass of one person which even includes his wife Donna and their adolescent son Henry. He has just arrived in Cincinnati, where he will be speaking at a conference, and in the process wants to reconnect with an old flame named Bella who lives there, in the hopes both that he can make it up to her about the way they broke up, and that she will be that bright light he is looking for in another person. Their meeting is nothing like he wants and doesn't clear up anything in his life. Alone and depressed in his hotel room, he meets Emily and Lisa, two women who will be attending his seminar at the conference. While it is Emily who usually is the one to whom most are immediately attracted, Michael instead wants to get to know Lisa, because she is different than everyone else and not included within that one big mass. His attraction to her is despite her having a scar on her face which she hides with her hair and she being non-confident in herself as a person. The question becomes what both Michael and Lisa can do to help the other in the issues the other is facing, both in the short term while they are in Cincinnati, and in the long term after the conference is over and they return to their respective lives.—Huggo A middle-aged man, Michael Stone, is in Cincinnati to give a presentation at a conference. He is a customer service guru and has written a big-selling book on the subject. While in town he looks up an old flame he left 10 years previously. Though he is married with a child, he seems very discontented, depressed and empty, and is looking for some way to fill the void. Then he meets Lisa.—grantss Anomalisa tells the story of Michael Stone: America's most successful motivational writer and customer service expert. Spending one night in Cincinnati, Ohio, Michael meets the first person in his life who looks unique to everyone else around him: a young woman named Lisa. Love struck by hearing her voice, Michael starts getting intimate with this person he's only just met, and soon Michael will start having more questions than answers about his purpose in life. Michael will do anything to keep his special 'Anomalisa' from becoming another one of 'the normal faces'.—Johnny Note: This entire film is done in realistic-looking STOP-MOTION ANIMATION with marionettes. Also it is set in 2005 when it was originally written, as a radio play.In darkness, we hear different voices talking to each other -- but they're all from the same voice (Tom Noonan). We see an airplane in the clouds and then pull back to reveal we're in another airplane with Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) looking out the window. He is flying in to Cincinnati and reads a letter from a former girlfriend a vision of her appears over the text, yelling the angry letter at him. The plane lands and the man seated next to Michael apologizes for grabbing his hand during the descent it was a reflex because he's a nervous flyer and he's used to having his wife with him. Michael says it's okay. But suggests that the man let go now.Michael goes through the terminal where all the people sound exactly the same as they talk. He goes outside and asks the cab driver to take him to the Fregoli Hotel downtown (Unrelated note: it's not stated in the film but this is actually the name of a disease in which delusional people think everyone they encounter is the same person in disguise). The cab driver begins a conversation with Michael, asking him if he's British. Michael says, yes. The cab driver tells him he has an ear for accents. Michael tells him he's lived here for a long while. The driver asks, ""Cincinnati?"" He says, no, he lives in Los Angeles. He meant the States. The cab driver laughs, saying he loves the phrases British people use like ""the States"" and ""shrimp on the barbie."" He repeats that he has an ear for accents. Michael asks if there is a toy store near the hotel and he is told that there is one very close and he can't miss it. He then tells Michael about the things he should do while he's in Cincinnati including visiting the zoo, which has some rare endangered species. He also is adamant he try the Cincinnati chili which is nothing like the chili Michael's had in Los Angeles or London. Michael says he's only there for one day. The man keeps asking him, ""What? Can you repeat that?"" So he says ""I. AM. ONLY. HERE. FOR. THE. DAY."" The cab driver responds with the same broken tone, telling him the zoo won't take up too much of his time -- it's not too big or small, it's zoo-sized. And the chili will only take about an hour.Michael gets to the Fregoli. As he walks to the reception desk, people begin whispering, ""It's Michael Stone"" over and over. The man checks him in to a smoking room with a king-sized bed. He asks if he can have a quiet room. The man types on the computer for a long while and says it's been taken care of. A bellhop comes and leads him to the elevator, telling him ""After you"" and Go ahead even though Michael keeps entering and exiting before he can prompt him. They get to the room and the bellhop points out random things like ""This is the bathroom"" and gives advice like not to forget his room key when he leaves. He loiters and Michael gives him money for a tip -- the bellhop responds with incredulity as if he hadn't even thought of it. He gives Michael his card and says to call him if there's any trouble. Michael tosses the card, goes to the bathroom. He takes an antidepressant pill. Urinates in the toilet. He turns on the television, which turns to a hotel channel explaining what to do in case of a fire -- first feel the door for heat and then fill the bathtub with water. He looks down at the magazines by the phone -- one is a local magazine with a story encouraging visitors to ""TRY THE CHILI."" He wants to call for room service but there are tons and tons of buttons with pictures of food on them. He finally presses one and the voice on the other line (once again, the same voice as all the other characters) says, ""Hello, Michael Stone. Would you like room service?"" Michael orders a salad and an entree. The man on the phone asks if he wants to add alcohol but Michael says he'll get something from the mini bar. The voice repeats the order back in elaborate detail, naming each item in each dish. He says it's 9:13 and it will arrive in about 35 minutes, which would be 9:48. Michael hangs up. He then uses his cell phone to call his wife -- who has the same voice as the taxi driver, the receptionist, the bellhop, the room service operator. She asks him about his room and he says it's nothing special but positively notes that it has a big bed. She tells him thats good for him because of all the tossing and turning he does. He says it's thrashing because of his sleeping problems. She then says she's going to put their son on the phone even though Michael insists not to -- his wife is too busy talking to their son to hear him. The son comes on, sounding exactly like the wife (a male voice), and he says he's dressed as a pirate and asks his dad if he's going to bring him a present. The conversation is short and the boy says goodbye.Michael lights a cigarette and begins practicing his speech for the event the next day. He looks out the window. A man is watching porn, alone in a neighboring office building, and begins to masturbate. He looks up at Michael who has to step behind the curtain to prevent further awkwardness. Michael goes out in the hall, gets ice from the ice machine. A couple is fighting in the hallway but both the man and the woman sound identical. Michael goes back into his room and turns on the TV flips from the channel advising how to handle a fire in the hotel. Watches a scene from ""My Man Godfrey. Michael pours himself a drink from the mini bar. He opens the phone book and finds Bella Amarossi He calls her. The same male voice we've heard answers. He asks if Bella is there. She says this is him and asks who he is. He says, sorry, she doesn't sound like he remembered. He says it's Michael Stone -- they haven't seen each other in 10 years. She points out that it's been 11. He tells her he's in town and decided to look her up in the phone book. Tells her he now has a wife and a son and asks if shes also remarried -- she abruptly says, no. He tells her he's there for a conference and staying at the Fregoli. She points out this is a fancy, expensive hotel. He suggests they meet. She tells him she has gained some weight and doesn't want him to be surprised. He says he doesn't care. She then points out that she also had her front tooth replaced after she fell and hit a cement bench but he probably won't be able to tell because they did a good job blending it.Michael goes down to the lounge. He sees an attractive, full-figured woman enter. But she meets someone else. Then another attractive, full-figured lady enters with an out of shape woman. The out of shape woman approaches, asking ""Michael?"" They sit and talk with Michael ordering the specific drink he always gets. She is still bitter about him walking out on her 11 years earlier. He suggests going up to his room. She gets angry at him and leaves.Michael goes to the toy store by the hotel. He talks to the clerk and there is a giant dildo on the counter. He realizes the taxi driver told him about a store that sold the wrong kind of toys. He asks the man if there's anything that he could get his son, who is a pirate. The clerk doesn't have any suggestions. Michael takes note of a large sex toy behind the clerk's head of a Japanese woman's upper torso -- one half of her body is ""flesh"" and the other is exposed framing. It is an mechanized doll with a moving mouth. Michael is told it's a very popular item, from Japan.Michael goes upstairs and takes a shower -- at first getting mad at the shower for being too hot, then for being too cold. While he's drying off, he begins to wash his face and hears a FEMALE VOICE (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in the hallway. He freaks out, struggling to put on his pants. He goes in the hallway but it's now empty. He knocks on doors hoping to find the woman, telling other hotel attendants, with the same voice he always hears, that he's looking for a friend and doesn't remember his room number. He knocks on a door and a voluptuous blond woman answers, seductively. She then apologizes and says he isn't who she was expecting. He says he was looking for a friend but he guess she's not there. She then recognizes him as Michael Stone and says he's the reason they're in town -- to go to his conference the next day. Then her friend, Lisa, is revealed in the bathroom excited because shes a huge fan of Michael. When she speaks, its the same female voice he heard. She comes out of the bathroom and gushes over him, telling him she loves his book, which she holds up (It is titled ""How May I Help You Help Them?"", revealed to be a self-help book for businesses). She tells him they both are customer service representatives and their business used their book and now productivity is up 70 percent. She is very awkward and tells him she doesn't have makeup on and for him not to look at her. Despite her insecurities, he is charmed by her and tells her she has a great voice. She is taken aback by the compliment and figures that's why she must do well in phone sales. He invites the two women downstairs to have a drink with him.They go to the hotel bar and he orders the same drink as before; they get apple mojitos. Lisa continues being awkward, telling him about the different items that the baked goods company they work for makes (junk food akin to Oreos and Cheetos). She says that she plays the Jew's harp a little but doesn't want to say ""Jew's harp"" loudly in case she offends Jews. She badly sings along to the music playing overhead. She tells them that they came from Ohio just to see him speak and that they splurged on the fancy hotel because it's sort of a vacation even though she actually can't afford it.They go back in the elevator, all now buzzed. Lisa complains that she didn't get to press the button to their floor and that she loves pressing buttons and that must be weird, being a button presser lover. When they're headed back to their room, Michael asks Lisa to come back to his. Lisa is surprised, saying that men usually are interested in Emily, not her. He says Emily is lovely but he seems to have connected with her. Emily encourages her to go back to his room because he's ""gorgeous."" As she walks, she actually falls flat on her face. She is embarrassed but has such low self-esteem, its not out of character.They go back to his room and it takes four tries with the key card until the light finally turns green instead of red. Lisa says its really cute how Michael turned down his covers and put slippers on the floor. He points out this is turndown service and she admits to never having stayed at a fancy hotel before. Michael sits on the bed and Lisa takes a seat across from him, in the chair at the desk. She doesn't understand why he likes her because usually Emily gets all the attention when they go out -- she hasn't dated someone in eight years and that guy was a man in his 60s who had a daughter older than her. And he pursued her simply because he figured she wouldn't say no and he was right. She tells him she's not very smart and didn't go to college, didn't even graduate high school. When she read his book, she had to use a dictionary to look up all the words she didn't know. He likes that she read his book with a dictionary. He asks her more about herself and she mentions liking music, with her favorite being Cyndi Lauper. He asks her to sing something. She says she can't sing -- well, she can sing, everyone can sing, but she can't sing well. He prompts her anyway to sing. She nervously begins to sing an a cappella version of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."" After hearing so many people with the same voice, Michael is touched hearing her voice as she sings. He begins to tear up and she tells her it was beautiful but she interrupts by singing the male refrain of ""Girls, they wanna-- they wanna have fun. Girls. They wannathey wanna have fun."" She tells him she relates to that song because she also just wants to walk in the sun. She asks him why that song made him cry; he says he loves her voice so much. She brushes her hair back and accidentally reveals a large scar above her right eye -- it's been hidden because she has always kept a strand of hair over it. He asks how it happened and she says she doesn't want to talk about it. He asks if he can kiss her there. She rambles on about how weird it is that he wants to kiss her there. He tells her he likes her and tries to relax her by asking about her day. They lay back on the bed and he kisses her repeatedly on her face while she tells him a long story about how Emily and her got up early in Ohio, drove to Starbucks, she got a grande mocha Frappuccino while Emily got a chai latte. The drive would only take about four hours if they drove at 60 miles an hour, with bathroom breaks. They would just stay on the 71 almost the whole time because the hotel is right off the freeway. They played No Doubt in the car because Emily likes them. She brought a Sarah Brightman CD and she has a beautiful rendition of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" in Italian. Michael asks her to sing a little and she does. She explains she loves learning other languages -- Italian, Japanese of course, but not German because it sounds so angry. She wants to learn Portuguese and finds it fascinating that Brazil is the only country in all of South America where they speak Portuguese. All the while he kisses her, takes off her shirt so she's just in her bra. She says she used to hate being different but now she kind of likes it. It makes her unique, an anomaly -- that's a word she learned from his book. He says, she's Anomalisa. She likes that. He puts his hand on her skirt and she squirms. She says she's ticklish down there but it's okay, he can touch her. She even moves his hand down there to show him. He then moves down and slides her panties off, performs oral sex on her. She stays silent. He asks why she's not having a reaction, if she doesn't like it. She says she does but maybe he can be gentler. He is. When she's aroused, she asks him to come up there. They begin to have sex. He asks her if she talks during sex. She says she doesn't know, it's been at least eight years. He asks if she can talk (her voice is the first female one he's heard in years) and suggests she makes moaning sounds. She does and they have a short intercourse session. They go to sleep.Michael and Lisa are woken up in the middle of the night by a call from the hotel manager; he tells Michael he needs to speak with him about a sensitive manner in private, that he needs to visit him in his office down in the basement. Michael goes down there and finds himself in a small office with dozens of employees typing at computers. They tell them the hotel manager is waiting for him and to go inside. Michael walks into a large warehouse-like room. The manager is at the far end, behind a desk -- he says that he had the option of a 3000 square foot office upstairs or this massive one so, of course, he chose the basement. Michael walks towards him but the manager insists Michael use the golf cart parked by the door. Michael drives it all around for a long while, finally driving it up the ramp. The manager sits at a desk in front of a framed picture of then president George W. Bush. Michael complains about being woken up, saying he has a speech to give. The manager says he knows, he has read Michael's book and the hotel's productivity has gone up 90 percent. He tells Michael he was informed that Michael was having relations in his room that night. Michael asks if that's a crime and the hotel manager laughs and says philandering is not uncommon in the hotel. He just says that it can be anyone but Lisa. The manager suggests if Michael wants to fuck someone, it should be him. Michael is freaked out and tries to get away in the golf cart but it just falls down a pit at the lip of the stage. He runs away back, into the reception area where all the receptionists are now ordinary-looking woman. The manager tells Michael that he can be with any of them, just not Lisa. One woman offers, in Tom Noonans voice, to let Michael fuck her. Michael runs up to his room, screaming. The bottom half of his face falls off (the joints of the puppets have been distinct throughout the entire film instead of being removed in post-production). He picks it up, puts it back on his face. He sees Lisa in the hall. He runs back to his room but she falls on her face. He gets to the room, tries four times to get his hotel key card to work. In the room, he sees a billboard outside the window for the Cincinnati Zoo with the description ""It's zoo-sized.""Michael wakes up. Lisa tells him he was thrashing around in his sleep and even hit her in the face with his elbow, which she didn't mind. Michael apologizes, says he is known for doing this in his sleep. Michael asks her if she wants him to order room service. She asks if she can get scrambled eggs. At the table in the room, Lisa and Michael eat breakfast. Lisa asks what happens with them now; she knows he has a wife and son. He says he doesn't really because they don't exist because they're all the same person -- everyone is the same person except for her. He asks if Lisa would be willing to move to Los Angeles. She says, yes. As they eat, Michael notices she is letting her fork scrape against her teeth. He finally interrupts her, tells her to stop doing that. She apologizes, says people always tell her she's a pig when she eats. She continues eating and suggests going to the zoo after his conference. Michael gets distracted by her obnoxiously chewing with her mouth open. He asks her to stop. She then chews for a long while before she finishes her thought. Lisa continues about how the zoo has endangered species including polar bears, which aren't actually bears. As she drones on about trivial things, her voice begins to overlap with Tom Noonan's (who voices all the other characters). By the end of the meal, her voice is now entirely his.Michael gives his speech to the crowd at the conference but he is mentally gone. He rambles on drunkenly, having a psychotic breakdown, murmuring how he doesn't love her anymore -- amidst giving tips from his book like how the key to good customer service is by remembering every person you meet has their own life, has their own childhood, should be treated like a friend, you should always talk with a smile even on the phone because people can tell. This is all ironic because Michael considers everybody as having the same voice thus the same identity (even though they all physically look different). He begins to mock their president (George W. Bush) for sending them to war, which upsets some of the crowd. He looks up at the lights. Begins to sweat. The speech goes horribly. Lisa is in the audience, mortified every time he mumbles about losing his feelings for his new love.Michael returns home to his wife, who is voiced by Tom Noonan, as is their son who comes in asking for a present. Michael gives him the Japanese automaton with a moving mouthpiece that he got from the sex toy shop. The boy complains about it being a doll for girls. Michael's wife then points out it looks like semen is coming out of the mouth (we don't see this happening) and her son asks what semen is to which she replies ""It's just a liquid."" As they are arguing, dozens of people pop out of the living room for a surprise party. Michael asks who all these people are. His wife tells him they're all of his friends. He says he doesn't know any of them. The festivities continue and everyone speaks in the same voice. Michael's psyche grows crazy until the only sound he can hear is the Japanese female automaton singing a song in Japanese.Lisa rides in a car that Emily is driving. She writes a letter to Michael, which we hear in voice-over her female voice again. She says she really enjoyed the short experience they had together and she understands that it was only temporary and is now over. She also said she looked up ""anomalisa"" in her Japanese-American dictionary and found out it means goddess of the sun. She hurriedly notes that she's not suggesting she is one though."
Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727776/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three scouts, on the eve of their last camp-out, discover the true meaning of friendship when they attempt to save their town from a zombie outbreak. A reckless janitor accidentally releases a zombie from a laboratory of research. Meanwhile, the teenagers scouts Ben Goudy and Carter Grant decide to camp for the last time since they are too old to be scouts. The problem is that they do not want to harm the feelings of their friend Augie Foster and the Scout Leader Rogers. They have a flat tire after hitting a deer on the road and Carter's sister Kendall Grant, her boyfriend and her friend Chloe stop their Jeep to see whether they need a ride. They invite Ben and Carter to go to a party in the night. The two scouts leave the camping during the night to go to the party. When they drive through the town, they do not see a living soul and they decide to visit a night-club since the bouncer is not at the door. They discover that people have turned into zombies and they team-up with Ben's recent acquaintance Denise Russo, who is bartender in the nightclub, and Augie that was left alone at the camp and came to the town. Soon they discover that the non-infected inhabitants have been evacuated and the town will be bombed by the government. They decide to rescue Kendall but they find that the address her boyfriend gave to them is wrong. What can they do to save Kendall?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Three high school sophomores, Ben (Sheridan), Carter (Miller), and Augie (Morgan), are trying to recruit new members for their Scout group, led by their Scout Leader Rogers (Koechner). While Augie has always been happy about being a Scout, Ben and Carter have second thoughts. Carter tries convincing Ben to quit but he can't as Augie is about to get his Condor Patch. Their conversation of quitting is cut short when Ben accidentally hits a deer. They manage to get help from Carter's sister, Kendall, and her friends. Ben, who's had a crush on Kendall, gets some advice from her and they all see that the dead deer has vanished. Before they leave, the two are invited to the ""Secret Seniors Party"" and Carter is given the address. When they go to get alcohol for the party, they meet Denise, a cocktail waitress that works at a strip club. She and Ben hit it off and she agrees to buy the alcohol for them. Nerdy high school model student Ben Goudy and his class buddies, naughty Carter Grant and sissy 'chubby' Augie Foster, are the overdue scouts in Leader Rogers's small town troop, which hasn't managed to recruit anyone for years. Finally invited to a cool kids party via kin, Ben and Carter sneak off but are caught by Augie, who gets bitter learning they plan to leave the scouts. All has to be suspended as they are confronted with a deer and people affected by a rabies-like plague which creates zombies. The boys team up with fearless strip bar 'waitress' Denise Russo, who in the process builds up dating-virgin Ben's confidence, while the zombie epidemic gets so bad the army is called to bomb the town off the map.—KGF Vissers The film starts with Ron the janitor (Blake Anderson) jamming out to ""Black Widow"" in the halls of a research facility. He enters where Dr. Pieter Morris (Theo Kypri) is working on something. Pieter leaves to get a snack from the vending machine while Ron cleans up. He notices something behind a curtain. There, he finds a man hooked up to a machine with tubes, and his skin is pale and veiny. Ron grabs the man's wrist, and he twitches, making Ron stumble backwards and screw up the machine. As he tries to fix it, he then attempts to give the man CPR, until he sees his bleeding gums. He tries to resuscitate him with his hands, but they go through the man's stomach. The man jumps up and starts throwing Ron all over the room while Pieter is struggling to get a bag of chips out. As he tries to reach the bag, Ron emerges from the room all zombified and attacks Pieter. The bag then slowly drops to the bottom.Three boy scouts and childhood buddies - Ben (Tye Sheridan), Carter (Logan Miller), and Augie (Joey Morgan) - are with their Scout Leader Rogers (David Koechner) for scouts registration day. Unfortunately, only one kid is there, and he leaves after watching the corny video. Although discouraged, Rogers reminds the boys that tonight is a special night for Augie, since he's getting his Condor Badge.While driving home, Carter tells Ben that they need to tell Augie that they want to quit being scouts, despite sticking around for the last two years after the death of Augie's dad. Carter is more interested in hooking up with girls, while Ben thinks they should stick around for their buddy. Ben then hits a deer on the road, causing a flat tire. As they change it, Carter sees his sister Kendall (Halston Sage) arriving with her boyfriend Jeff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) and friend Chloe (Niki Koss). Ben has a crush on Kendall, despite her seeing him as a little brother and Carter not knowing. While Ben talks to Kendall, Carter chats up the other two and gets an invitation to a secret senior party that night. Ben then notices that the deer is not in the same spot where it fell. Thinking the party could be life-changing for them, Carter tells Ben that they can go to Augie's badge ceremony and sneak out to the party when he's asleep. Ben drives Carter home where they run into his grouchy elderly neighbor Ms. Fielder (Cloris Leachman), who tells Carter to keep his garbage bins away from her driveway.In the woods, Rogers walks and finds Pieter's badge. He sees something rustling in the bushes. The deer emerges in its zombie state and tries to get Rogers. He stabs the deer in the eye with his lucky knife, only to then get his throat bitten out by zombie Pieter.On the way to the ceremony, Ben and Carter stop by the liquor store so Carter can give a drunken bum $20 to get them beer. This backfires since the man makes a ruckus in the store. Passing by is Denise (Sarah Dumont), a girl that supposedly dropped out from the boys' high school and became a stripper. Ben meets her when the handle of her purse breaks, so he fixes it with a special knot. Denise notices that Carter is trying to get the money back from the bum, so she goes in and coolly grabs the money and gets the beers for the boys before heading to work at the strip joint across the street, Lawrence of Alabia (seriously).Ben and Carter meet Augie in the woods where he's already getting his camping gear ready. The boys hang out and goof off all afternoon until it gets dark. They light a fire and roast marshmallows. Augie tries to light the fire with a flint, but fails and has to use a lighter. When Carter leaves for a bit, Augie expresses his joy at getting to hang out with his friends, making Ben feel a little guilty about wanting to leave.After Augie falls asleep, Carter gets Ben and they drive away, only for Augie to show up on the road. He knows about the party, and while he's heartbroken and disappointed, he tells the guys to go anyway.Ben and Carter stop at the liquor store for a moment. Ben sees that the glass door has been shattered. Carter sees that the bouncer at the strip joint is missing. He gets Ben to go inside with him. Carter runs to get money from the ATM while Ben sits by the stage. A stripper comes out and starts to dance. When Carter shows up, the zombie stripper climbs the pole, and blood spurts from her open neck wound, revealing she is a zombie.. The boys run and find the bouncer is a zombie too. He chases Ben into the bathroom while Carter hides from the stripper. She pulls him out from behind the bar, but Carter kills her by sticking a broken glass bottle in her head (which causes blood to pour from the open wound onto his face). Denise (who is really a cocktail waitress) appears with a shotgun and blasts the bouncer's head off.The three run outside, and the boys slowly realize that they are indeed dealing with a zombie breakout. They run to Ben's car as a horde of zombies approach. Ben drives like crazy out of there, causing his spare tire to fall off. Denise holds off the zombies as the boys quickly replace the tire before they drive away.Augie goes to Rogers' home. He sees nobody there other than a weird collection of Dolly Parton items. Augie then goes to take a dump and returns to the living room to find zombie Rogers. He chases Augie through the house all the way to the basement where Augie grabs a can of lighter fluid and a gas lighter to set his scout leader on fire. He then ties Rogers up and leaves.Ben, Carter, and Denise go to the sheriff's department and see a sign that says the town's been evacuated. The zombie horde gets closer, and the three run inside. The cops have been zombified as well, forcing them to lock themselves in a cell. Augie later shows up after seeing Ben's car and blasts ""Crank Dat Soulja Boy"" to distract the zombies. As the zombies leave, the three try to get the key from the wall. Ben uses Carter's condoms as a chain and manages to grab the keys until Augie shows up and accidentally kicks them into a drain pipe. Fortunately, Augie picks the lock with his knife. A zombie comes in, but Ben impales it through the head. They head out.The four walk down the road and encounter the drunken bum as a zombie. Augie attempts to assert himself using his scouts knowledge, leading him and Carter to sing ""Baby One More Time"" with the zombie after they notice his Britney Spears shirt. A bullet then goes through the bum's head, fired by a soldier. He takes the four to the address that Carter was given for the party so they can save Kendall. However, Jeff gave Carter the address to a sewage plant (because it's ""full of shit""). Augie tells Carter now he knows what it's like to be screwed over. Carter then admits that he and Ben were already planning to quit being scouts. This makes Augie tell Carter that Ben has a crush on Kendall, angering Carter. To make things worse, they hear on the radio that the town is to be bombed in less than two hours. As the boys fight, the soldier turns into a zombie and attacks Denise. The boys help her, and she smashes the zombie's head with the car door. Carter deduces that Kendall probably wrote the location of the party in her diary, so they take the truck to his house.Back in the boys' neighborhood, they encounter Rogers, half-burnt, and they run him over. They go into Carter's house to find the diary. They look through Kendall's room until they hear a noise from downstairs. Carter and Augie go to check it out. Denise then sees a picture of Kendall and understands why Ben has a crush on her. Noting his lack of confidence, she tells Ben to kiss her. He tries but accidentally headbutts Denise. She then does it for him.Zombies break into Carter's home, including Ms. Fielder. She attacks Carter and tries to literally eat his ass until he and Augie force her against a window to break it and then chop her head off. More zombies attack. The gang fights them and run toward Kendall's room to jump on the trampoline and over the fence. Carter, Denise, and Augie go ahead with Ben going last. As the zombies break into the room, Kendall's diary falls out of the underwear drawer. Ben grabs it and goes to jump, but there are too many zombies on the trampoline, and too many in the room. Ben prepares to jump but nearly slips until he grabs hold of something...a zombie penis. The penis rips off, and Ben falls on the trampoline after Denise distracts the zombies.The gang runs into Ms. Fielder's home where they encounter her zombie cats. After escaping them, they head into the garage and steal her car before getting out of there.The boys learn that the party is at a rec center. Denise finds a motorcycle and goes to get help. Ben gives his friends a rousing speech on how they're going to kick zombie ass and save their friends. They stop at a hardware store and grab many supplies before heading to the party.At the party, Chloe and her boyfriend Travis (Lukas Gage) go into a room so Travis can have sex with Chloe. She refuses but allows him to eat her out. A zombie with no lower jaw enters and kills Travis. He eats Chloe out for a bit before turning her into a zombie. Kendall is worried about her brother, until Jeff admits he gave Carter the wrong address. Pissed, Kendall leaves. Jeff tries to hold her back, but she slaps him. He pushes Kendall as zombie Chloe enters and attacks Jeff. Kendall runs away, only to see that more zombies are coming. When it looks like she's done for, the scouts arrive to lay waste. Ben mows the zombies down with a weed whacker, Carter has a nail gun, and Augie has a gun that shoots heavy balls. Carter ""nails"" Chloe in the head, while Ben decapitates Jeff. The boys lead the survivors to the stairs while Ben rescues Kendall. He stays behind to lock the doors while his friends run toward a room. Augie places a bomb that he made on the floor and tries to light it. Ben makes another speech on how he and Carter were jerks for trying to ditch Augie; that he and Carter only wanted to leave the Scouts because they were afraid everyone would see them as dorks and socially backward; and that he really loves being a Scout because that's how he became friends with them. Augie goes to light the bomb, but the lighter is out of fluid, and Augie has to again struggle to use his flint. Denise shows up and guides the boys out through a slide. At the last minute, Augie lights the bomb with his flint, and gets out before it goes off and blows up the zombies. The last one is Rogers on the outside, but he's blown up by a grenade. The military finally arrives to save the day.The morning comes, and Denise encourages Ben to go after Kendall. Without a second thought, he walks up to her and kisses her passionately. Augie thinks it's sweet, but Carter is displeased. Kendall smiles, impressed, asking Ben, ""Who are you?"" Ben answers, ""I'm a Scout!""During the end credits, we see the gang's selfies, including Ben taking Kendall to prom and Denise hanging out with the guys. After this, we see outside the rec center where Rogers' head is still alive. A bird poops on him and he goes, ""Come on..."" before turning to the audience and saying ""The end!"""

Maggie's Plan,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3471098/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Maggie wants to have a baby, raising him on her own, but when she gets romantically involved with John, a married man, things get complicated and all the balance of Maggie's plans may collapse. Maggie's plan to have a baby on her own is derailed when she falls in love with John, a married man, destroying his volatile marriage to the brilliant and impossible Georgette. But one daughter and three years later, Maggie is out of love and in a quandary: what do you do when you suspect that your man and his ex-wife are actually perfect for each other? The opening scene begins with Maggie (Greta Gerwig) helping a blind man across the street. She meets her friend, Tony (Bill Hader) in Washington Square Park (NYC) and talk about how she is about to be artificially inseminated by a guy she met in college. She says she wants to be a mother but alone because none of her romantic relationships last more than six months. Tony points out they dated for two years; she writes that off because they were in college. She mentions that the guy whose sperm she is using is the weird Math major they both knew who is now a pickle entrepreneur. Maggie meets the guy, named Guy (Travis Fimmel) at his pickle business in Brooklyn. Guy is a sort of hipster with a long beard; he points out has expanded his business to three employees and that Whole Foods may possibly sell their product in stores. She gives him the sterile cup for his semen sample and tells him to keep it warm until he can drop it off. He asks what kind of involvement she expects him to have in the child's life and she says none.Maggie goes to The New College where she works as a career advisor to art and design students. She stops by the secretary's office to tell her that she received two paychecks instead of one. This ends up being a mix-up because her birth name is very close to an adjunct anthropology professor named John Harding (Ethan Hawke) who happens to stop by, complaining that he hasn't received his check. The two leave and begin a conversation in the park, listening to a man recite Shakespeare for tips. John tells Maggie about his wife, Georgette, who is a professor at Columbia and a published author. He says that shes wonderful but she is destroying his life. John further explains that he has been trying to write a book but has put his dreams on hold in exchange for Georgette's career. John uses the analogy that in every relationship there is a gardener and there is a rose and he is the gardener. He then asks Maggie if shell read the first chapter of his book and she agrees, enthusiastically. He realizes he is running late and rushes off.John gets to Columbia where he joins his wife, Georgette (Julianne Moore) on stage at a discussion on ficto-critical anthropology, moderated by Wallace Shawn. Georgette speaks with a distinctive Danish accent and seems to revel in being intellectually superior to John. Back at The New College, Maggie spots John during a lunch break and asks Tony's wife, Felicia (Maya Rudolph) about him. She tells him that hes a panty melter.At home, John has dinner with his family but both Georgette and his two kids are too busy with their electronic devices to have a healthy conversation. So he responds to a text, too from Maggie, who said she finished reading the first chapter of his book. Maggie and John have another meeting in the park and she tells him she loved what shes read of his book so far. Her encouragement brings John happiness as hes used to having this part of his life neglected at home. Because of the cold weather, Maggie suggests going back to her place. Her apartment is filled with piles of books but she explains that they actually belong to the poet who she works for. John makes hot whiskey for the two of them using lemons and honey.Maggie talks to Tony and Felicia about how she is about to get the sperm sample from Guy and Tony mentions again how hes an idiot yet somehow a math genius. She rushes home to get her sperm sample from Guy. When he shows up, he tells her he is willing to give her his sperm the old-fashioned way. She politely declines. He has forgotten the sterile cup but luckily she has another one. He goes into her bathroom to produce a sperm sample and comes out almost immediately. After he leaves, Maggie goes to the bathtub and tries to artificially inseminate herself with a turkey baster. This process is interrupted as there is a buzzing at the intercom. She rushes over to respond, dropping some of the sample; it is John downstairs. She tells him it will be a moment and wipes up the floor. When she finally goes downstairs, he is still there. Up in her room, she begins telling him she likes the new chapters of his book, which seems to be slightly autobiographical in that she mentions the uptight wife character. He tells her that he has left Georgette and has nowhere to go. John gets on his knees and tells Maggie he is in love with her. He begins to undress her and they have sex.The film immediately cuts to three years later. John and Maggie are now married, living with their three-year-old daughter in a spacious apartment. When John gets a call that his son has hurt his leg and needs to be picked up from school early, Maggie and him debate about who should go. Both of them have meetings Maggie with a student who shes helping pitch an idea for an anatomically correct baby doll. She decides to cancel her meeting so John can go to his. Johns son is disappointed to see Maggie. They then have to wait a long time to pick up his sister from her school, wasting Maggie's afternoon. Annoyed by the noise that the boy is making towards her baby, Maggie asks him to go see why his sister is running late. She notices he rushes up the stairs, no longer faking an injury. Johns daughter arrives and explains that she couldn't find her shoes after gym class.When they get back home, John is on the phone with Georgette. He explains he ended up missing his meeting because Georgette was having trouble deciding which UK publisher to choose for her new book. Maggie complains that she missed out on her meeting so he could go to his and he didn't and all to talk to his ex-wife about her book which is about their divorce. She also points out that their son faked an injury because he was expecting his dad to pick him up since it was his visitation time and he wanted to spend more time with him.Maggie pushes her infant daughter in a stroller and passes Guy, selling pickles at a food stand outside Washington Square Park. He asks if the baby is his but she explains that she got married shortly after he dropped off the sperm. She mentions his math wizardry and Guy tells her how hes always had a brain for math. He then tells her that Whole Foods is going to now be selling their pickles and gives her a large jar, free of charge.At home, life becomes mundane for Maggie. John is more and more focused on his book and becomes distant towards her, completely self-consumed. It is the opposite of his marriage to Georgette in which he was the one doing all the work to keep the family in tact. The two of them have discussed going on a trip but Georgette has to go out of town so they will not be alone anymore (they'll have to watch Johns kids) so it is cancelled. When they have dinner, everyone at the table is texting, once again like Johns marriage to Georgette.Maggie complains to Tony and Felicia that she is now the gardener and John is the rose. She is working full-time while he has quit his job as a professor to work solely as a book. The book is now 500 pages and he doesnt seem to be stopping anytime soon he keeps adding and adding to it and she can no longer give notes because he seems to make it up as he goes.Georgette is having a book signing in the city so Felicia and Maggie crash the event to finally be able to study her Maggie has never met her, despite being the stepmother to her children. Georgette reads from her new book, Bring Back the Geisha, which is about how her husband had an affair with another woman and left her. Maggie is in awe of her and wonders if somehow they could do a switch John can go back to Georgette, as Maggie is not used to being in a long-term relationship and wants to be single again.Maggie drops the kids off at Georgette's house and is set to go inside. But she keeps loitering by the sidewalk. The children talk to each other in Danish about how weird they think Maggie is. They ask if shes coming inside. She tells them shes just shocked she found a legal parking spot in that area and keeps checking the sign. Inside, Maggie spots a picture of John on the wall. She suggests to Georgette that John and her might get back together. Georgette claims Maggie just feels guilty about being the other woman who convinced a man to leave his wife and this is her way of righting her wrong. Maggie leaves, discovering a parking ticket on her windshield.Later, at work, Georgette stops by the campus and tells Maggie shes thought it over and shes in. She tells Maggie that shell be attending an academic conference for Ficto-Critical Anthropologists in Quebec and suggests getting John to go. Georgette can get John invited to speak and points out that his favorite philosopher, Slavoj Zizek, will be there.At home, John mentions cavalierly that he got invited to speak at a conference but he is ready to rule it out in exchange for plans he had already made with Maggie. She convinces him to go and he tells her how excited he is because Slavoj Zizek will be there.John spots Georgette at dinner when he first arrives in Canada. He tries to have a conversation but she is not able to engage him, resorting back to her icy personality. But everything changes when all of the speakers go skiing together Georgette cannot walk in her snow shoes so she falls far behind the others. John is a gentleman and stays behind to assist her and soon they are completely separated from the pack. While they search for the lodge in the snow-filled woods, they rekindle the chemistry they had as a couple. Georgette asks to read Johns book as she knows he brought a copy. He agrees. When they get back to the resort, there is a power outage and they will be snowed in at the resort for several days. Georgette and John go back to his room and get romantic.When he returns to Manhattan, John tells Maggie straight up that he ran into Georgette and admits that they had sex. She is not angry with him but encouraging, telling him that maybe its best that they get back together. John becomes fixated on Georgette again. He visits his kids at his former home and they seem very confused to see him there. After he is supposed to have left, he stays upstairs to have sex with Georgette again but the kids keep calling out to their mom so he finally just leaves for real.Maggie continues to build a relationship with her three-year-old daughter, as the single mother as she always envisioned it. They have a cute scene in a bathtub where Maggie asks for advice on John.John visits Felicia to talk about things. Tony comes home, drunk. When John mentions he is getting back together with Georgette, John points out that Maggie's plan worked. That's when John realizes him falling back in love with Georgette was all constructed by Maggie. He confronts her at their home. She admits to the scheming but wonders if their relationship would have been rekindled without her involvement, being that they're such a natural pair.Georgette, John, and Maggie begin to co-exist with their children in Maggie and Johns apartment. Georgette likes Maggie because she considers her pure albeit a little stupid. Johns children are able to have a meal at the table without electronic devices and seem to respect Maggie's contribution to their lives more now. After John goes out and Maggie leaves to drop the kids off at school, Georgette stays behind to read his book. Without explanation, she puts the manuscript in a trash can and burns it.Georgette meets John for lunch and brings along the pieces of the charred manuscript. But instead of telling him she hates it, she explains that it can be improved and she is able to pinpoint exactly how he needs to focus more on the scientific analysis, which he is known for, rather than polluting the story with narrative, etc. He is impressed at her literary mind and how she always knows exactly what is best for him. She also offers to help him get published and knows which publisher is most suitable. Its obvious that they are a good yin and yang, especially now that Georgette respects Johns career and its an equal partnership.Georgette and John officially get back together but Maggie remains in their life. The trio go ice-skating with their three kids, as well as Tony and Felicia and their son. Maggie is glad that her plan to get John back with Georgette has worked but says she is done playing matchmaker. On the ice, Maggie's daughter begins counting and it is noted that she seems to have a rare understanding for math which doesn't seem to be genetic as its not a characteristic anyone in Maggie's or Johns family has. Just then, Guy appears on the ice and there is a spark between him and Maggie. The film ends... but it is implied that the artificial insemination that happened on the same night Maggie had sex with John might have been more effective than she assumed.THE END"

They're part of the punk rock band The Ain't Rights. They slept all night with the engine on. Pat and Sam ride a bike to a nearby parking lot and siphon some gas to get them back on the road.The band meets up with a guy named Tad (David W. Thompson) for an interview in his apartment for his radio program. He asks the band what their ""desert island band"" would be. Reece, Sam, and Tiger think of theirs, but Pat can't. After the interview, the band plays a gig, but their pay is barely decent split between the four of them. Tad tells the band that he got them to do a gig in a spot where his cousin works, and that the pay is better.The band arrives at the venue, which happens to be a skinhead bar. They meet Tad's cousin Daniel (Mark Webber). The managers misspelled the band's name as ""The Arent Rights"". They go up to play a cover of ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off"", which doesn't go well with the crowd. They then play a different song, which doesn't get a much better reception.After the show, the band gets their money and are about to head out. Sam forgot her phone in the green room, and Pat goes to get it. When he enters, he sees two people, Werm (Brent Werzner) and Amber (Imogen Poots), standing over the body of Amber's friend Emily, dead with a knife in her head. Pat freaks out and runs out of the room while calling 911. Two bouncers, Big Justin (Eric Edelstein) and Gabe (Macon Blair), force Sam, Reece, and Tiger into the room. Their phones get taken away while Justin holds them all at gunpoint.Gabe gets two young skinheads together to stab each other in response to the 911 call as an officer arrives. The club's owner, Darcy (Patrick Stewart), arrives, and he says the band has to be dealt with.The band attacks Justin and take his gun, with Reece pinning him down and threatening to break his arm. They let him up and Reece holds the gun at him this time. The club experiences a power outage, inciting a brief panic among the group until Amber turns on her lighter and sparks up a cigarette, which she gives to Justin and tells the band to watch the cherry in case of anything suspicious. The lights then go back on.Darcy stands outside the green room to calmly discuss with the band on how to handle the situation. They agree to hand over the gun but keep the bullets. Pat still remains suspicious as Darcy says the cops have come and gone. Pat gets ready to hand Darcy the gun outside the room, as Darcy claims there is nobody else with him. This proves to be a lie when Amber sees another pair of feet through the vents. Before she can warn him, Reece tries to attack Darcy with a rod while Pat's arm gets slammed and cut up horribly. Reece pins Justin back down and snaps his arm, then places him in a chokehold until he passes out. Amber finishes him off by cutting him open with a box cutter.While Darcy and the skinheads plan to get rid of them, the group starts to break through the floorboards for a way out. This leads them to a bunker where the skinheads run a heroin operation. There's no exit down there, so the group returns to the room. Tiger helps wrap Pat's arm in duct tape. With no other options, the group plans to make a run for it while arming themselves with some kind of weapon. Tiger and Reece run out, but Tiger gets his throat ripped out by a pit bull, and Reece gets stabbed to death.
?Pat, Amber, and Sam have to stay in the room. Daniel and Gabe go to the room, where Amber tells Daniel that Werm killed Emily when Werm learned that Emily was going to run away with Daniel, and now Darcy is going to pin her murder on the band. Daniel guides the three downstairs to get some guns, but Daniel gets a buckshot to the face, courtesy of a skinhead. Pat kills the skinhead with a machete. The three run outside with a shotgun, facing the skinheads. Darcy tells them not to shoot at Amber. Sam gets shot in the leg and is then mauled by the pit bull.Pat and Amber go back to the room, now both frightened and tired. Pat tells an anecdote about a paintball tournament he participated in, which he compares to his current situation as he was outnumbered in both scenarios. He and Amber then come up with a plan to survive.Darcy sends two skinheads into the green room to kill Pat and Amber. They find Pat yelling nonsensically, now with his head shaved and his face with black paint on it. He hops into the bunker, and one skinhead follows. The other skinhead sits above keeping watch, unaware of Amber hiding in the couch. She crawls out and slits the skinhead's throat with the box cutter. The first skinhead looks for Pat with his shotgun. Amber distracts him by throwing the bodies of Emily, Justin, and the second skinhead down. Pat seizes the chance to grab the skinhead's gun, but they fight for it. Amber descends with the gun of the skinhead she killed and shoots the other one dead.Gabe goes to the room as Pat and Amber make their way back up.

The End of the Tour,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416744/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the five-day interview between Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky and acclaimed novelist David Foster Wallace, which took place right after the 1996 publication of Wallace's groundbreaking epic novel, 'Infinite Jest.' The film opens in 2008. David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) is working at home on his laptop when he gets a call from Bob Levin (Ron Livingston). Levin tells Lipsky that he has gotten an unconfirmed report that writer David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) has committed suicide. Lipsky refuses to believe it, thinking it is kids causing a death hoax. He searches for the news online, which only confirms what Levin told him. Lipsky is shocked to the core. As news of Wallaces death spreads, numerous people write tributes for him. Lipsky reads a eulogy at his local radio station.At home, Lipsky searches for some old cassette tapes and batteries to play the recorder. As it powers up, he hears Davids voice as if he was still alive. Lipsky drops the tape recorder to the floor in shock as he listens to the man he once interviewed for five days.12 YEARS EARLIERLipsky is doing a public reading of his novel, which has been a moderate critical success. Afterwards he goes to a bar to meet up with some friends. One woman mentions this amazing author that she just found out about named David Foster Wallace. Lipsky is intrigued.Back at his apartment, Lipsky reads a glowing review about Davids work to his girlfriend Sarah (Anna Chlumsky). The reviewer is basically saying that the best of the year has already been decided and Davids novel Infinite Jest is nothing short of genius. Sarah jokes that if the book is so great perhaps he will have to read it. So, Lipksy buys a copy and begins to read it. Shit, he says halfway through, in awe of the mans talent.At the offices of Rolling Stone where he works, Lipsky goes to his boss Bob Levin and tells him that Rolling Stone has never interviewed a writer but they should interview David Foster Wallace because he is the leagues of such greats as Hemingway. Lipsky promises Levin there is a story there. After mulling his decision, Levin goes to Lipsky and grants his request, telling him there better be a story there.Lipsky packs his bag for the trip while Sarah watches, starting to read Infinite Jest herself. He grabs a copy of his own book off the shelf, apparently as a gift for David. Sarah smiles at the act while Lipsky just shrugs.DAY ONELipsky gets on a plane to Illinois, and rents a car. He gets lost, and calls David from a payphone to ask for directions to his house. David asks where he got his number. Lipsky says his publicist gave it to him in case of emergency. Youd do me a favor by losing it, David says abruptly. Lipsky is stunned by his bluntness.Lipsky finally arrives at Davids house where David is waiting for him, along with his two large dogs. They awkwardly say hello and go inside. Lipsky compliments on the house and its view and begins to get ready to start asking questions. Lipsky apologizes about calling David but David brushes it off. The reason he was curt with Lipsky (though noting he was mostly joking with him) was because he had to unlist his number due to fan calls, and people contacting his parents to find him.Lipsky is using a tape recorder to catch everything they talk about. David however, has a request before they truly begin; that they have strict off the record guidelines. If he is to say something he does not want recorded, Lipsky is not to use it later for the article. Lipsky gives him his word that he will stop recording whenever David wants him not to talk about a certain subject.David and Lipsky drive to the college where David teaches. David says he feels bad since the book tour caused him to miss several weeks of classes. Lipsky sits in on a class and sees how easygoing yet critical David can be when he is trying to teach to his students. Lipsky tells David after that it is clear that his students love him.David and Lipsky go eat at a diner. David orders a soda so Lipsky does the same. Lipsky is cautious in his first questions, asking David about drinking, but David assures him it is not a problem, and Lipsky can drink in front of him if he wishes. Lipsky admits he was unsure and ordered a soda too to be respectful of David. David asks Lipsky on how he sees this interview. Lipsky says it will be about how it is like to be the most talked about author in America today.David begins to talk about the tour and how he admits that he hoped that he could get laid a few times because of it, though he admits how awful that sounds. He also notes he wouldn't be able to straight up ask a woman to go with him; he would need them to basically tell him they were going to the hotel with him. David then says hes glad it never really happened because it would make him feel lonely. When Lipsky asks why, David says it is because he would know it wouldn't be about him, it would be about his fame.Lipsky then comments that people might thinking by reading his personal books might be a way in their eyes to know David himself. David says that it is a really good quote. David tells Lipsky he is afraid of being a whore; using the tour, this newfound fame for bad purposes, for cashing in on his art.David and Lipsky go to a convenience store to buy soda and a bunch of junk food. When Lipsky tells David that he has an expense account with Rolling Stone that will cover everything, David gets more.In the car, they talk about the awful nutrition of candy and sweets but how tasty it is and how good it makes you feel. They discuss pop culture and how it is usual bad quality, which segues into a short discussion about how good the first Die Hard is.David and Lipsky return to his house. David talks more about Infinite Jest. He says the book is asking the question why? Why do people do what they do if it makes them unhappy?Inside, they discuss meaningless acts such as watching too much television or compulsive masturbation. David then goes on a long monologue about the future of pornography and how it will desensitize an entire generation into accepting a soulless stimuli for primal release because it is easier to be alone with an illusion that to be real with a person.Lipsky, a smoker like David, asks to try some of his chewing tobacco. He immediately cant stand it and asks to use the bathroom. He spits it in the sink then looks into Davids medicine cabinet, looking for clues.Leaving the bathroom, Lipsky returns to the living room, noticing David has no TV. David says that is true, because if he did he would watch it all the time.Lipsky asks if David is currently dating anyone. David says no, noting he is completely out of practice and wouldn't know how to do it anymore. He has wished since being on the book tour that he was married since he would be able to share it with someone that didn't have an agenda and would listen to him. His friends, editors, and Lipsky himself may like him and care about him, but they all have an angle to play.David asks why Lipsky isn't married at 30. Lipsky says he is not sure how he can find a person that can fit with him especially they would be with him for the next thirty to forty years. David says he isn't at 34 because he knows that he is hard to be around. His particularly way of living needs him to be alone when working for one, and this could lead him to become quite selfish with how he acts.Changing the subject, Lipsky asks about an Alanis Morissette poster David has. David says he is a fan and he likes her because she is a pretty girl that doesn't seem fake; someone you could actually meet in real life. David admits he has a crush on her and would like to meet her, but would be too flustered to manage a conversation. David doesn't want it to look like he is using Rolling Stone to get her attention. Lipsky dryly notes that Rolling Stone has been used for worse.David notes that it is late and they need to be up early to catch a plane for the last book tour stop. Lipsky goes to get a motel room but David offers him a guest room instead. Lipsky cant sleep and looks around the room, where David has numerous copies of his books laying around.DAY 2Lipsky wakes up and goes into the kitchen where David offers him coffee. Lipsky declines, and gets a cigarette to smoke instead. David offers him half a pop tart but Lipsky declines. David gives him half and insists. ""Mi pop tart es su pop tart"", David says.David and Lipsky drive to the airport. Lipsky asks why he doesn't live in New York. David says he can't deal with the ego of the people there. Lipsky then asks about his trademark bandana. David cant believe that is a real question. He finally admits that he started wearing them in Arizona when it was really hot to keep the sweat off his typewriter. He then became comfortable with them and knows he uses them as a bit of a security blanket. He hates the idea that they have become a trademark of him.David tells Lipsky that he started writing seriously around age 21 and he didn't have much inclination to write before though he wrote a terrible WWII novel at age 9.Lipsky asks about Davids parents and wants to ask some questions about his youth. David tells immediately that his parents are private people and he would be not comfortable with that, and tells Lipsky no, he is not allowed to. Lipsky says okay.As they wait for the plane to take off, Lipsky asks David about the worst job he ever had. David mentions being a security guard and a towel boy. Lipsky then mentions he knows about Davids eight day stay in a mental hospital, which makes David shut down. Davids voice gets a bit cold and he explains he checked in himself because he Didnt want to do something stupid. He explains he had a friend in high school that attempted suicide and failed and only resulted in giving him brain damage.David says that he was depressed. He had a good 5 year run and things werent going his way anymore. I thought my life was over at 28, David says. Lipsky notes that he turned it around though and is now promoting a critically acclaimed and bestselling novel. David is silent for a moment then looks at Lipsky.""Dave, this is nice. This is not real,"" David says.They make it to Minneapolis where they are met by an overeager escort/driver for their trip Patty (Joan Cusack). Patty drives them to the hotel and they check in.In his room, Lipsky checks in with Levin, who asks him if he asks David about the heroin rumors. Lipsky says he hasnt gotten to it yet, and David is hard to open up. Levin asks if he likes David, and Lipsky admits he does. Youre not his friend, youre a reporter, Levin barks and tells him to get the story.That night, David and Lipsky attend the final reading at a bookstore where a full audience is waiting. There Lipsky meets David's friends Julie (Mamie Gummer) and Betsy (Mickey Summer). Lipsky learns Julie writes poetry and got one published, and tells her he wrote a book himself. Before David gets on stage to do a reading, he requests from the store owner that he not do a Q&A. ""It's not because he is unwilling to do one per se, its just that the questions are quite repetitive, such as Where do you get your ideas?""David goes out on to the stage to rapturous applause. Afterwards he signs books for fans.David, Lipsky, Julie, and Betsy go for food after at a diner. David explains he uses his entire name because his name was common and there were a few David Wallace's already.The four drive back to the hotel, belting out Alanis Morrisette, with David staying silent.Back at the hotel, Lipsky and David discuss audience love. David is afraid that the wrong kind of audience will love him. Lipsky confesses that Sarah loves Davids work and he is afraid she loves his writing better than his own. David asks for him to get her on the phone. Lipsky calls her and David speaks to her for 25 minutes, thanking her for liking his work. Lipsky later explodes on his girlfriend for talking to him that long, jealous.DAY 3Lipsky goes to David's room, surprised he is not ready. He knocks on the door and David peeks out. David said he got caught up in a TV marathon and he is almost ready. Lipsky waits for him in the room, sensing something is off about David.They get out to the car where Patty is waiting for them. Patty comments on Davids clothes, which is what he usually wears anyway.""You're wearing that? Patty asks.""For a radio interview, yeah"", David replies, confused.David and Lipsky go to a radio station and David gives a great interview. When they get out, Patty is ecstatic, saying David did so good and awkwardly says she will have to buy his book now for sure. Patty says they have the day so they can go anywhere they want. David asks if she knows where The Mall of America is and Patty says she does.David and Lipsky sit and watch the amusement park rides in the mall. Lipsky asks who David thinks his audience is. David says a young man in their 20s who have problems with loneliness. David says most people under 45 have feelings of loneliness a lot because they have done all the things that society expects of them to be happy, yet they are not content with the life they have.David also explains the quandary of selling a lot of copies. Mainly, things that sell a lot are usually bad, but if you happen to sell a lot of copies, then your argument/defense mechanism (of saying people have no taste/that you cannot believe your work cant sell) falls apart.Julie and Betsy meet the two and they go to see the movie Broken Arrow. Afterwards, David asks if they have a TV so they can watch some.Lipsky talks to Julie at her home, and asks he can follow up with her about David in grad school. Julie says it is okay, as long as David says it is okay and gives him her email address. David sees this and becomes enraged with Lipsky, thinking he is flirting with Julie. Lipsky denies it, and says he only got her email address. David then says he doesn't want him to talk to Julie. He says he told Lipsky him and Julie dated in grad school and he shouldn't be flirting with a woman when he can't figure out what he wants anyway with his girlfriend.""Just stay away from her, okay?"" David asks being a combination of angry and sad. ""Be a good guy.""Lipsky, angry at David, breaks his no drinking rule and gets a beer and watches David watch a movie.On the taxi back to the hotel, Lipsky offers to pay with his expense account, but David firmly tells him he will pay.They get into the elevator in silence. On the way to their rooms, Lipsky tries to apologize but David ignores him.DAY 4Lipsky and David get on a plane back to Illinois. They are in separate seats this time. Lipsky looks back at David. When they return, Lipsky is searching for the car in the parking lot but it takes him several minutes to find it to Davids frustration. David asks why he didn't write down where he parked and Lipsky says he doesn't know, further noting that he's a ""fuck up"". David asks what his problem is, and Lipsky shoots back what is his. They get in the car and drive off.In the car, they trade shots back at each other. Lipsky thinks Davids problem is that You still think youre smarter than other people. David says ""I don't believe writers are smarter and does not meaning people are not better in other areas than him."" David notes that he treasures his regular guyness but Lipsky believes that is a cop out.""You don't crack open a thousand page book because you hear the author is a regular guy. You do it because hes brilliant,"" Lipsky says.David basically shuts down at this point, saying he can no longer give Lipsky what he wants without seeming fake.Later, as David drives, he notes he is feeling the end of the tour, and that he had to shut down emotionally during the time and now he has to feel it all. He notes he doesn't like the attention and if he became a sellout he would rather be dead. He says tomorrow, Lipsky will go back to New York, and he will go back to knowing 20 people. ""The tour is like heroin to the cortex"", David says. Lipsky perks up, having the in to ask the question he has meaning to since the interview began.When they get back inside the house, David tends to his dogs while Lipsky turns his tape recorder back on. Lipsky finally asks about the rumor of Wallace using heroin which pushes David to his breaking point.""I was not, I never was involved with heroin"", David says. He knows Lipsky wants something to make the article seem sexier and drugs are sexy to readers, despite David telling him television was the biggest addiction of his life. David talks about his depression and how he drank a lot and it was a clinical numbing so he could try and function. He mentions the room he stayed in during his hospital stay and how he had to be watched constantly in case he hurt himself.Lipsky goes to bed, realizing he may have gone too far in asking David those questions. David comes into his room and talks to him more, calmed down. He tells Lipsky that his depression wasn't due to brain chemicals or alcohol. It was because David was unhappy at being ordinary, of doing everything expected of him, and feeling no contentment. ""All your actions are false, and it means nothing. It's an illusion and it makes you feel horrible. I don't think people change. I still have those parts in me. I just don't want them to take over and drive, David says.David leaves, and Lipsky quickly writes down everything David said.DAY 5Lipsky wakes up and sees David. David looks happy and chipper compared to last nights talk.David and Lipsky go on a walk in the snowy grounds around his home with his dogs. They both comment on how beautiful it is. Lipsky asks to take David somewhere nice to eat before he leaves. David decides on McDonalds.Back at David's house, they eat their food. David gets a call and tells the person he would like to go, but he has someone over right now. Lipsky asks what the call about. David says it was about a dance he goes to at a local Baptist church, since he found he likes dancing. Lipsky ponders the location and David shrugs. Baptists can dance, he says. Plus, this type of dance is more of a solo affair which allows him the solitude he craves while still being around people. David says before Lipsky leaves they should exchange addresses. Lipsky agrees.Back in 2008, Lipsky continues to listen to the tapes, tears in his eyes.While David is outside the house, Lipsky goes around the house and using his tape recorder, speaks about everything he can see, in order to better articulate it in his writing.Outside, Lipsky hands a copy of his novel with his address information inside the jacket. Lipsky thinks what he is doing is silly, but David thanks him and says he looks forward to reading it after he finishes his next book. David promises to tell him what he thought when hes done. Lipsky tells him not to worry too much since it didnt sell well.Before he gets into his car, Lipsky asks one last question. ""Is it reassuring that a lot of people read you?"" Lipsky asks.David responds that it causes people, including yourself to have unrealistic expectations. The more people think you are great, the bigger the fear is of being a fraud, David says. Before Lipsky leaves, David tells him, ""I'm not so sure you wanna be me.""""I dont?"" Lipsky replies.David tells him to give his regards to his editor. Lipsky drives back to the airport.Back at home, Lipsky begins to write his article on David. He gets a package from David, containing a shoe he accidentally left behind and a short note, nothing else. Lipsky is left bewildered and confused.Though not stated in the film, the article is never published in Rolling Stone.Several years after David's death, Lipsky uses the tape transcripts to write a memoir about his time with David, which becomes a bestseller. While we see David dance at a Baptist Church, Lipsky reads his memoir to an audience. He remembers the time he spent with David driving around and that those talks were the best of his life. Lipsky says David thought books allowed people to feel less alone. Lipsky says that he wished he could have told David, that being with him, during those five days, made him feel less alone."

Ip Man 3,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2888046/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a band of brutal gangsters led by a crooked property developer make a play to take over a local school, Master Ip is forced to take a stand. The year is 1959, where Ip Man lives in Hong Kong with his wife and his younger son. Trouble arises when a corrupt property developer and his thugs terrorize the school where Ip Man's son goes to. Ip Man and his disciples have to help the police guard the school day and night. On the other hand, Ip Man has to deal with his wife's terminal sickness, and at the same time faces a challenge from another Wing Chun fighter who ambitiously seeks to claim the Wing Chun Grandmaster title.—heyitsnuel In 1959, Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is settling into his low-profile life in Hong Kong. The film begins with Ip Man practicing his techniques on a wooden dummy, as a moth, foreshadowing the future, gently flutters and lands on the dummy.The opening subtitles explain that his elder son, Ip Chun, has returned to Foshan to study, leaving him with his younger son Ip Ching and his wife Cheung Wing-Sing in Hong Kong.A young Bruce Lee (Danny Chan) visits Ip and asks to become one of his students. After Lee demonstrates his speed to Ip, Ip neither accepts nor rejects him and tells him to ""come back later"". Ip Ching is seen fighting with another boy, Cheung Fung, at school, and both boys end up with minor injuries. Wing-sing, along with Ip, is asked by Miss Wong, the boys' teacher, to come to the school. As an apology, the Ip family invite Cheung Fung to their home for dinner. At Ip's house, Cheung Fung displays rudimentary yet impressive Wing Chun skills. When Ip asks the boy who his mentor is, he says that it is his father, Cheung Tin-chi. Cheung shows up to pick up his son shortly after. Cheung Fung is very poor and his father pulls carts for a living.Cheung is seen participating in black market boxing matches and having a streak of victories. The organizer, Ma King-sang, a local triad leader, also works for Frank (Mike Tyson), an American property developer. Frank orders Ma to acquire a piece of land occupied by the school where Ip Ching and Cheung Fung study. Ma asks for a month for it to be done, but is threatened into assuring that it will be done within two weeks. Meanwhile, Frank is impressed by Cheung's Wing Chun skills.The next day, when Ip goes to pick up his son from school, he witnesses Ma and his men coercing and beating the headmaster, who refuses to sell them the school. Ip interferes and restrains Ma, but is forced to let Ma go as Ma's men are holding Miss Wong at knife point. Ip seeks help from Sergeant Po (called Fat Po by his friends), a close friend of his and a local police detective. Fat Po agrees to help Ip, but claims a shortage of manpower and influence. Ip then agrees to guard the school alongside his students.That night, Ip and his students watch the school compound. Lik, Ip's oldest student, develops a crush on Miss Wong, but the latter promptly rejects his advances. Realizing that it was getting late, Ip suggests Lik and the other students return home; however, immediately after that, Ma's men invade the compound. Although Ip and his students are able to hold them at bay, they are still outnumbered as the gang manages to kidnap the headmaster and set fire to a few classrooms. Cheung, who happens to pass by, helps fight off the invaders and rescues the headmaster. Cheung Tin-Chi's skills impress Ip, and Ip thanks Cheung Tin Chi for his help.Tin Ngo-San, a local martial arts master and Ma's former mentor, is enraged by Ma's unscrupulous acts, and accompanied by Ip, confronts Ma at the Hong Kong shipyard and slaps him in front of his men. Ma retaliates with a hidden knife, but Ip is able to stop him from nearly stabbing Tin and again restrains him. Fat Po arrives and keeps the situation at bay, but Ip eventually lets Ma go to deescalate the situation.Humiliated, Ma finds Cheung Tin-Chi and offers him a job: to get revenge against Tin on his behalf. Desperate for money to open his own martial arts school, Cheung accepts the offer. Meanwhile, Wing-sing is diagnosed with stomach cancer.Cheung, whose face is hidden with a bandanna, finds Tin in his umbrella shop and proceeds to fight him, with Tin failing to defend himself against his assailant's swift blows, and ends up in the hospital with a broken arm. Ip receives a call from the hospital and visits Tin. Upon learning that Tin did not call him, Ip realizes that it was a set-up by Ma to lure him away from the school, so that his gang could kidnap some of the students, including Ip Ching and Cheung Fung. Ip arrives at Ma's shipyard surrounded by Ma's men. Ma, who is holding Ip Ching at knife point, threatens to sell the kids off to slavery if the headmaster still refuses to surrender the school. Upon learning that his son was also kidnapped, Cheung Tin-Chi arrives, picks him up, and promptly leaves; but after his son tells him that ""his friends are still there"", he returns and fights alongside Ip. Ip and Cheung are able to hold their own, until a troop of policemen led by Fat Po comes to arrest the gang, while Ma flees. Ma is later fired by Frank after the incident, and is replaced by a proficient Thai boxer to go after Ip instead.Returning home, Ip is told by Wing-sing about her condition, and that she may only live for six more months. While taking Wing-sing to the clinic, Ip is attacked by the Thai boxer, who is promptly defeated after a few moves. Fat Po later tells Ip about Frank, who wants to eliminate Ip at all costs for obstructing his plans. Ip decides to confront Frank in his office. Frank challenges Ip to a three-minute fight- if Ip can withstand his fists for three minutes, he would leave the school, Ip, and his family alone, a challenge that Ip accepts. From the outset, Ip is seemingly overwhelmed by the sheer muscle and force of Frank, who dominates the fight thoroughly. Realising he is no match for Frank in terms of speed and power, Ip attacks Frank's footwork instead and is able to launch a few punches on him. Just as both are about to launch a decisive blow on each other, the three minutes had passed. Ip leaves the office and Frank keeps his promise, seemingly impressed.Cheung Tin-Chi, with the money he obtained from Ma earlier, opens his martial arts school, and claims that his Wing Chun is genuine while Ip's isn't. Cheung proceeds to defeat a number of martial arts masters and becomes famous in the news. Finally, he challenges Ip to a battle that will decide who is the true Grandmaster of Wing Chun. Meanwhile, Ip spends more time with his dying wife. On the day of the match, Ip chooses not to attend, but instead goes out dancing with Wing-sing (after having been taught a few moves by Bruce Lee, whom Ip finally accepts as a student). Some of those who attend the match become impatient, as Cheung Tin-Chi waits for his opponent. Ultimately, Cheung Tin-Chi is declared the winner, owing to Ip's failure to attend. Wing-sing, despite being happy about Ip's decision to accompany her, makes an appointment with Cheung Tin-Chi for another match on Ip's behalf, as she knew that Ip would have attended if not for her condition.Wing-sing accompanies Ip to the fight. They first fight with Six and a Half Point Poles, which Ip and Cheung Tin-Chi fight to a standstill. They then fight with Butterfly swords, with Ip seeming to win narrowly. When Cheung loses his swords, Ip throws his away, and they proceed to fight without weapons. They both seem evenly matched, with both being able to deliver several blows to each other. However, Cheung Tin-chi successfully lands a blow to Ip's right eye, temporarily blinding him. Cheung Tin-Chi's victory seemed certain, but Ip evades Cheung Tin-Chi's following hits with his hearing, and counters Cheung with a one-inch punch, despite not being able to see. Defeated, Cheung relinquishes his title as the Grandmaster of Wing Chun, and chooses to destroy the banner that proclaimed himself to be the Grandmaster. Ip then remarks that ""What's most important are the ones closest to us"", and leaves.In the epilogue, it is revealed that Wing-sing died in 1960, and that Ip helped make Wing Chun well known internationally and left a legacy."

The true story of London's most notorious gangsters, twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray. As the brothers rise through the criminal underworld, Ronnie advances the family business with violence and intimidation while Reggie struggles to go legitimate for local girl Frances Shea. In and out of prison, Ronnie's unpredictable tendencies and the slow disintegration of Reggie's marriage threaten to bring the brothers' empire tumbling to the ground. The movie opens with Reggie Kray coming out of an apartment in East End London and bringing a cup of tea to 2 policemen sitting in a car. A narration from a woman informs us that one of the policemen is named Nipper Read. The policemen are watching Reggie and are annoyed that he openly mocks them for tailing him. Reggie walks down the street to get one of his associates who didn't show up for work that day, his driver Frank. Another associate, Albert or Albie, is following in Reggie's car. At Frank's apartment his sister Frances, who is doing the voice-over, greets Reggie and it is obvious Reggie is attracted to her. Frances' mom comes to the door and tells him to get lost as Frank arrives downstairs. They drive down the street a ways and Reggie and Albie get out then walk thru a winding alleyway and lose the police tail. Next we see Ronnie, Reggie's moments-younger twin brother, telling Reggie and Albie a story about willing someone to give him their pudding and it working. This serves as an illustration that Ron is not a clear-minded individual. The narrator informs us that Ron was serving a prison sentence for grievous bodily harm but he has been remanded to a psychiatric facility as insane. Now Reggie wants Ron declared sane so he can leave so next we see an enforcer named Pat, nickname Big Pat, in a shrink's office making a subtle threat. Next we see that psychiatrist before the parole board saying Ron should be released. After he's released the psychiatrist tells Reggie that Ron is dangerous and gives Reg medicine for Ron to take daily or he warns there will be big trouble.Next we see Reggie picking up Frances for a date, of which her mother openly voices her disapproval. He takes her to an East End club that he owns where he explains he invites celebrities to come hang out with some of the rough characters from around town and they show up because it makes them feel edgy. At the club Reggie is pulled away to deal with Jack, a manager who's been stealing from the take on one of their drug operations. Reggie is surprisingly lenient with Jack, simply telling him to pay the money back and stop stealing, then returns to his date with Frances. Frances asks if he enjoys being a gangster and Reggie denies it, saying he's simply a club owner. Some time later Reggie takes Frances to meet Ron and he promptly informs her that he's homosexual.Next we see the beginnings of a turf war between Charlie Richardson, a South London gang leader, and the Krays. After a couple of minor dust-ups the Krays are invited to a parlay on neutral ground to settle it without more bloodshed. It turns out to be a set-up where Reggie and Ronnie are vastly outnumbered. After Ron uses a ruse to slip out, Reggie starts the fight and is holding his own until Ron shows up again with weapons and together they begin to savagely beat the men sent to hurt them. Next we are introduced to the Krays lawyer, Leslie Payne, who helps them arrange legitimate business operations to help cover for their illegal activities. Frances' narration tells us that Reggie liked Payne and considered him a useful and necessary partner but that Ron was always open in his dislike and distrust of him. Using Payne the Krays purchase interest in a casino that Reggie intends to use to become a legitimate businessman, a plan which Ron eschews because he enjoys being a rough-and-tumble gangster. Payne informs the twins that the American mafia has made inquiries in order to establish a working relationship with whomever is ruling the London underworld. Ron isn't interested in working with them but Reggie has Payne set up a meeting, which goes well and an arrangement is reached. Following scenes accompanied with Frances' voiceover tell us that the new casino is doing very well, making lots of money and accomplishing Reggie's goal of establishing him as a legitimate businessman. At the casino the same business plan as before is in place, with celebrities mixing company openly with gangsters. At the same time the brothers continue with various gangster activities like money laundering and protection rackets, among others. It's at this point that Reggie has to return to prison to finish out a sentence that had been on appeal but was now due to be finished. Reggie is viciously beaten by the guards in prison but he fights back. Ron tells Frances Reggie doesn't want visitors but she goes anyway, making Reggie angry.While Reggie is in prison Ron proceeds to ruin the business at the club because he doesn't want them to have a legitimate business, he wants to be a gangster. When Reggie gets out he proposes to Frances then he and Frances visit the club. Reggie is incensed at how Ron has ruined their money making enterprise and berates him in front of all their business associates. In response Ron ruthlessly insults Frances, causing Reggie to start a very violent fight. Later we see Reggie showing Frances a West End club that he intends to buy, again to reestablish himself as a businessman. In the meantime scenes show that Ron's homosexual lifestyle has brought him into frequent contact with at least a couple of members of the House of Parliament. This creates a difficult situation for the police who can't bust the Krays for fear that their links to the Parliament will be exposed. Frances' narration tells us that this influence helps them to get out of a more than a few legal difficulties over the years.Reggie and Frances get married but Frances' narration tells us problems arose almost immediately. Despite his legitimate business ventures, Reggie is still drawn to and receives lots of money from his and Ron's gangster pursuits like drugs, protection rackets, money laundering, etc. This keeps him away from Frances for a great deal of time. In addition Ron and Mrs Kray, their mother, make it clear to Frances that they don't think much of her. As a result Frances becomes very despondent over her situation, increasingly turning to drugs to help her cope. On the business front, Ron is increasingly volatile, acting out irrationally on multiple occasions and necessitating Reggie step in to hold things together. Complicating things is Ron's refusal to take his medicine because he enjoys feeling and acting violent. When one of Richardson's Southie thugs tries to muscle in on Kray territory, Ron commits cold-blooded murder in front of a room full of people. Nipper Read, who has been promoted to Scotland Yard, is put in charge of the investigation and commits to bringing down the Krays. Initially this case goes nowhere because all the witnesses are too intimidated by the Krays to testify. When Reggie makes it clear to Frances that he intends to continue with all his illegal activities despite her wishes that he quit, she leaves him then soon after commits suicide.For no apparent reason other than he doesn't like him, Ron hires Jack to kill Leslie Payne but Jack botches the job, sending Payne to the police. Because of Payne's tremendous involvement in all their various schemes it invigorates the investigation, resulting in the police gathering a large number of witnesses into protection. Shortly after the botched assassination attempt Reggie confronts and kills Jack at a party at Ron's house with several witnesses present. With Payne and the other witnesses, the police finally have enough evidence to prosecute the Krays and overcome their previous influence with the Parliament. A graphic at the end shows Reggie was convicted and sent to prison until he was granted compassionate release just 2 months prior to his cancer-related death in 2000. Ron was convicted, declared insane and remained committed until his death in 1995."

Tracker runs over and begins biting the man. Sam calls Tracker off of him. Afterward, Sam shoots the man in the head, killing him. Still hiding in the rocks, a teddy bear in Moises' backpack begins going off. Despite his attempts to silence it, it alerts Sam to their presence. Since it is almost dark, Sam tells Tracker that he will get them tomorrow. The sun sets for the night.The next day, Adela tries to look for Sam & Tracker's whereabouts. She spots Sam's truck from the top of a hill. She narrowly avoids getting bitten by snakes. Tracker senses her presence from the truck, so he takes off after her. Sam follows behind him. They get to the top of the hill and hear the teddy bear again. They find the teddy bear in a pit of snakes. It is a distraction as Moises & Adela make their way to Sam's truck. As Sam attempts to shoot them, he is graced by a snake, which he shoots. Moises and Adela make it to Sam's truck, avoiding his bullets. Moises grabs the antenna on Sam's truck and uses it to open the front door. They get into the truck, narrowly avoiding Tracker. Tracker begins to climb onto the truck. Moises is able to hot-wire the truck and takes off.Moises and Adela are happy that they have gotten away. However, Sam shoots at the truck, hitting Adela in the shoulder. This distracts Moises, and he ends up flipping the truck over. Moises climbs out of the truck and spots Sam climbing down a hill in the distance. Moises pulls Adela out of the truck. He also grabs a first aid kit that was in Sam's truck. Moises and Adela begin walking. Tracker takes off with Sam following behind him.Moises and Adela take shelter underneath a large cactus. Moises looks in the first aid kit and finds a flare gun inside it, along with some bandages. He uses the bandages on Adela. He takes the flare gun and leaves Adela by the cactus. Sam and Tracker begin to close in on Adela by the cactus. But, Moises uses his flare gun. Sam and Tracker take off after Moises because Sam thinks Adela probably doesn't have long to live (not knowing that she has got medical supplies from his first aid kit).Moises makes it to a cactus field and begins crossing it. Tracker also crosses through it. Moises stops and loads the flare gun with a second flare. As Tracker gets close, Moises shoots Tracker in the mouth with the flare. Sam, hearing Tracker's cries, runs towards him. He is too late as Tracker is dying. He shoots Tracker in a mercy kill and begins crying, saying that he's sorry. This further angers Sam and he begins shouting to Moises that he's a dead man.Moises spots a border patrol vehicle in the distance. He shouts at it but is not able to signal it in time. Sam spots Moises and shoots at him, but since Moises is right near a cactus tree, Sam hits the cactus tree. Moises takes off and Sam shoots at him again and misses a second time. Moises begins climbing another rock hill, avoiding a couple more shots from Sam. This leads to a five-minute cat-and-mouse sequence as Moises tries to escape from Sam at the top of this one massive rock mountain. Moises continually hides from Sam, until Sam stops at the edge of one of the cliffs of the mountain. Sam looks around for any signs of Moises. Sneaking up behind him, Moises tackles Sam off the mountain. Both men hit the side of the mountain and roll down it.Sam is injured. He looks down at his leg and sees that the bone on his right leg is sticking out through the skin. However, Moises appears to be fine. Both look over and see Sam's sniper rifle about twenty feet away from both of them. Both men get up and attempt to run to it. Moises is able to get the rifle. Sam pleads with Moises for his life. Moises chooses not to shoot Sam, but decides to leave Sam to die in the desert, despite Sam's pleas for Moises not to leave him.Moises begins walking again. He walks back to where he left Adela. He gets her to her feet and walks with her on his back. He carries her for miles, throughout the rest of the day. As it begins to get dark, Moises notices some lights ahead from some shacks and/or buildings, implying that they are near a town. The camera pans across the desert as the credits roll."

Hungarian-Jewish Saul Ausländer is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He, along with several other men, are housed in a different part of the camp, as they are all given the work of knowingly corralling the other prisoners into the gas chambers, the prisoners who believe they are taking a shower and given food before they start work. Saul and these men's work also entails disinfecting the gas chamber after use, going through the personal possessions of the dead looking for any items of value, and disposing of the ashes after the bodies are burned. It is after one of those gassings that Saul sees the body of who he believes is his illegitimate son. Out of circumstance, the Germans want to conduct an autopsy on the body. Without telling the Germans, Saul goes on a mission almost at any cost to prevent the autopsy from proceeding, and steal the body to give it a proper Jewish burial, which also means having a rabbi preside over the burial. To accomplish his mission, he will need the assistance of many of his fellow prisoners, which means telling them what he is doing. It is then that Saul learns that some of the other worker prisoners are trying to smuggle information out to show the world of the atrocities of the camp, while smuggle in items that will help in an uprising against their captors. Saul may have some issues in dealing with the other men who may see their own task as more important and incompatible with his. But another issue may throw a wrench into what they are all doing when they realize that their own usefulness to their captors may soon be coming to an end, meaning their own lives.—Huggo A look at Saul Auslander, a Hungarian member of the Sonderkommando, the group of Jewish prisoners isolated from Auschwitz in 1944 who were forced to assist the Nazis by cremating the bodies of the dead.

Based on the first of a trilogy by Tom Rob Smith and set in the Stalin era of the Soviet Union. The plot is about an idealistic pro-Stalin security officer who decides to investigate a series of child murders in a country where supposedly this sort of crime doesn't exist.

Under those circumstances, before long, things will take a turn for the worse, when Leo refuses to denounce his schoolteacher wife, Raisa, as a dissident--a bold act of devotion that will condemn the couple to exile, as the death toll keeps rising. However, in a system where distrust is ever-present, what separates an accident from murder?—Nick Riganas A literally flag-bearing member of the Red Army which bloodily crushed Hitler's inner circle last stand in Berlin, war hero Leo Demidov became a blindly loyal member of Stalin's merciless repression police.

Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife, who has announced that she is pregnant.Meanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora, is found dead near a railway yard. Although the initial pathology report shows injuries consistent with torture, the surgically precise removal of organs, and drowning, the authorities declare that he was hit by a train, as Stalin has decreed that murder is a capitalist disease; there is no murder in a communist paradise. Alexei is forced to accept the official conclusions to save himself and the rest of his family.Knowing what the consequences will be, Leo tells his superiors that his investigation has shown that Raisa is innocent of any crime and steadfastly refuses to denounce her. They are both later arrested by Vasili and Alexei and sent into internal exile in the provincial city of Volsk. Leo loses all rank and is forced to become a lowly policeman under the command of General Nesterov, while Raisa is humiliated by becoming a cleaner in a school.When the body of another child is found near the railway line in Volsk, with similar injuries to Jora, Leo begins to realize that a serial killer is on the loose. After discovering that Alexander Pickup, the man who found the body, is a homosexual, Nesterov forces him to denounce every local homosexual he knows. When Pickup, a railway ticket collector, commits suicide by walking in front of a train, the authorities say the case has been solved. However, Leo persuades Nesterov, who has young sons himself, to investigate further, and the two discover that the bodies of at least 43 more children have been found along the railway line from Rostov-on-Don to Moscow.Meanwhile, Vasili, who now has Leo's old job, calls Raisa and attempts to persuade her to leave Leo and join him in Moscow. When she refuses, Vasili orders an MGB agent to abuse her. Raisa later admits to Leo that she faked her pregnancy out of fear of him denouncing her and only agreed to marry him because she was afraid to refuse the proposal given his status as an MGB officer.Leo and Raisa travel in secret to Moscow to interview a woman who reported seeing Jora with a stranger in the railway yards. Although Alexei helps them, the interview is unproductive as the woman is too frightened to talk. Due to a large MGB and militia presence at the station, the pair ask Raisa's former colleague and friend Ivan Sukov, who she knows has contacts among dissident groups, to help them get out of Moscow. However, in his apartment they discover clues that he is, in fact, an undercover MGB officer (the cause of the arrests in Raisa's school) and that he has called the authorities. Leo kills him and they escape just before Vasili arrives. Leo tells Raisa that she can leave him if she wishes, but she chooses to stay with him.Leo and Raisa manage to return to Volsk, but there they are arrested by Vasili and his men for Sukov's murder. After being interrogated, Leo and Raisa are put on a train to a gulag. During the train ride, they are attacked by killers on Vasili's orders; after killing their assailants, Leo and Raisa jump off the train. They hitch a lift to Rostov, where the highest concentration of the serial killer's victims has been found. They correctly reason that the killer must work close to the rail yards there and travel the railway lines to Moscow in the course of his work. Vasili forces Alexei to tell him where they are likely to have gone, promising his family will be safe if he does so; Alexei tells him that Rostov is the likely destination before Vasili shoots him.In the Rostov tractor factory, Leo identifies the killer by cross-referencing workers' travel assignments with the location and date of the murders. Leo and Raisa pursue the killer, Vladimir Malevich, into the woods and corner him. He surrenders to them and says he cannot control his urges to kill children, but is suddenly shot in the head by Vasili, who has followed Leo and Raisa. Vasili tries to execute them but, after a vicious struggle, they kill him. Leo cleverly shouts to the MGB agents who arrive that Vasili is a hero who fought Malevich and killed him before dying himself.Leo and Raisa are both reinstated in their old jobs and Kuzmin is removed for his failures. It is hinted that Stalin has died and the MGD is being restructured. Leo is offered a promotion and a promising political position by his new superior, Major Grachev, if he will agree that Malevich, a former army doctor who spent two years in a German POW camp, was 'turned' by the Germans and sent back to the Soviet Union to wreak havoc there. He refuses the promotion but requests permission to set up and lead a homicide division in Moscow within the newly created MVD, with the help of General Nesterov. Grachev agrees and Leo in return agrees that Malevich was clearly a Nazi agent.Leo and Raisa track down Tamara and Elena Okun, go to the orphanage where they have been living and adopt them."

Ed grows up in an orphanage, growing up to become a writer, inspired by Ernest Hemingway.Now working as a writer on the city desk for the Miami Globe in 1959, Ed types out a letter of appreciation to Hemingway but puts it away rather than sending it. His colleague, Debra Hunter, finds the letter and encourages Ed to send it, but Ed says he doesn't know how to tell Hemingway how important his writings have been to him. Deb secretly mails the letter. Ed is later surprised by a phone call from Hemingway, who praises Ed for his letter and invites him to come to Havana to visit him and go fishing. Ed thanks Deb for sending the letter.Ed arrives in Havana and meet Hemingway on Hem's boat, along with Gregorio, Hem's crew. Hem teaches Ed how to fish and how to pilot the boat. Later, Hem and Ed go to the Floridita, a local restaurant and bar and Hem explains to Ed ""the power of less"" when it comes to writing. As an example, Hem writes a six-word short story on a cocktail napkin: ""For sale, baby shoes, never worn."" Recognized by the locals, they come to Hem for pictures and signatures. Hem doesn't complain but doesn't look pleased at the attention.On a second trip to Havana, Ed notices a heavy police presence as well as impoverished neighborhoods while driving through the city to Hemingway's sprawling estate, Finca Vigia (""Lookout house""). He finds Hem and his wife, Mary Hemingway, swimming nude in the pool and joins them for drinks.The Hemingways and Ed grow closer, and the older couple, knowing that Ed isn't it contact with any blood relatives, invite him to be a part of their family.Deb and Ed have started a relationship and go skinny dipping in the ocean together back in Miami. Meanwhile, political dissent in Batista's Cuba intensifies.On his next visit, Ed joins the Hemingways and their friends for a large meal. (One of the guests was played by Mariel Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway's granddaughter). Hem also invites children to play baseball on Finca Vigia's vast grounds, acting as umpire and pitcher and clearly enjoying himself.In downtown Havana one day, Ed and Hemingway witness rebels allied with Fidel Castro bursting into a street near Havana's Government Palace to confront soldiers loyal to the government of Fulgencio Batista. The two writers take cover, and retreat to a bar later when the violence is over. Hem dejectedly tells Ed how useless war is.In Miami, Ed reflects on this important time of his life, when his hero has become his mentor and friend. He knows that the political changes in Cuba are going to be major news and he is poised to be the one to write about it. He's approached by an FBI agent, John Fletcher, to ask Hemingway his opinion on Batista vs. Castro. Ed refuses.Mary calls Ed at 2:30am while he's in bed with Deb. She wants to make sure Ed will visit soon, as Hem has become depressed and Ed seems to list his spirits.At his desk at Finca Vigia, Hem loads a pistol and puts it into his mouth. When Ed arrives, Hem is talking and yelling at himself.Ed finds Evan Shipman, the poet and friend of the Hemingways, at the estate and offers to help him with his old, weeping war wound, on his chest. Evan explains that Hem has been distraught for several weeks, and that Hem's craziness may be part of what makes him a genius.Hemingway stands at his writing desk, with a blank piece of paper in his typewriter.Having drinks by the pool, Hem confesses to Ed that he's been trying to write about Hadley, his first wife, the only person he's only felt love from. He explains that he cheated on Hadley with the woman he would later make his second wife and that his actions were unforgivable. He encourages Ed to make his decisions about love carefully and consider all the consequences. He rescues a bee from drowning in the pool, placing it gently on the side.In Miami, Ed is quite busy following the story of the political changes in Havana and spending time with Deb. She encourages Ed to commit to her, but he doesn't think he's able to and flies back to Havana. While there, Mary explains to Ed that Hem has been depressed and moody, haunted by the ghosts of his dead friends. She's afraid that he will commit suicide, which he has threatened before. This time, Mary says, it seems worse than ever and she wants to throw him a big birthday party.Mary plans an elaborate party where guests will play some of the important people in Hem's adventuresome life. Ed is to play General Buck Langham, a commander from WWII Hem knew, and Evan plays an African hunter. She also invites Hem's other favorite people, including veterans from the Spanish Civil War and exiles.As the guests and characters surprise Hem in his living room, Hem seems to perk up a bit. At the large meal, he is happy telling elaborate, possibly exaggerated stories of his wartime exploits, yet grows angry when Mary contributes to the conversation. She belittles his war experience. Mary and Hem snap at each other, their guests ultimately unable to derail the escalating argument. Hem complains about the IRS, who he thinks is after him; Mary becomes angrier, and his guests become increasingly uncomfortable.Ed is distressed that his adopted family is fighting nastily. Mary gets even more angry when Hem gives one of his friends several thousand dollars to help his daughter in New York. The fight disintegrates; she calls him a bastard; he calls her a bitch like his mother; she accuses him of loving Hadley and philandering; he says it was a mistake; she slaps him; he throws his drink in her face. She runs to another room.One of the guests, Luis, is a physician and takes Hem's blood pressure and pronounces Hem physically healthy but recommends that he drink less. The men talk about the growing unrest in Cuba and whether they can safely continue to live there. At Hem's insistence, Luis also looks at Evan's wounds, which, as Evan already knows, have become gangrenous. Luis changes his bandages and leaves him with pain medicine, knowing that his wounds will only worsen.The guests all leave, except for Ed and Evan who are staying at the Hemingway estate. Evan tells Hem that he's had a good life and has no regrets, and Hem apologizes for being selfish. And even though he has never cared about the Lord, he'll pray for his old friend.As one of Hem's guests, the mysterious Lucas, drives through Cuba, he is stopped at a military checkpoint. Military and government officials seem to be watching him carefully.Ed finds Mary in a guest room at the estate and consoles her as she tells him how much she hates the idea of destroying Hem's spirit.That night, Deb calls Eddie and says she can't wait for him to love her anymore. When he doesn't respond, she hangs up.Ed quietly enters Hem's writing studio and removes the bullets from the pistol on the desk. Meanwhile, both shaken by the news of Evan's terminal illness, Mary and Hem reconcile.Even later that night, Ed is surprised to receive a call and a not-to-be-denied invitation to visit Sal Trafficante, the local head of the mafia. He is driven to a posh restaurant and bar. Trafficante thanks Ed for investigating his friend Sal Lopez and revealing that the FBI had framed him. He also tells Ed that the U.S. government is unhappy with Hemingway's politics in Cuba. Secretly, the bartender calls Hemingway to report that Ed is meeting with the mobster. The mobster leaves, and Ed watches a surreal scene in the restaurant as an older woman removes her wig around a table of handsome, young men.Back at the estate, Ed finds Mary and Ernest awake and explains he met with Trafficante. Hem is drunk and angry and calls Ed a double-crosser. Mary warns Ed to leave, but Ed tries to explain that he isn't conspiring against Hem with the mafia or the FBI. Hem punches Ed, who falls but then stands up. Ed explains that Trafficante is trying to help Hem, that the government thinks Hem is providing weapons to the Cuban rebels.Ed goes outside and sits in the raining, in more pain from the broken trust with Hem than the actual punch. Hem seems to come to his senses and joins Ed outside. Hem gives a heartfelt apology and Ed goes back inside with them. Hem gives Ed some ice, and Ed asks why the government is after Hemingway.Hem explains that one of his old friends used to work for the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. He told Hem that one night Hoover and another man got him very drunk, put on women's clothes, and sexually assaulted him. The friend swore Hem to secrecy. But after the friend died, Hem had revealed the story to another party, and it got back to Hoover that Hemingway knew this damaging story. Thus the IRS and FBI probes and surveillance of Hem's life in the States and in Cuba.At night, the mysterious Lucas reaches another military checkpoint and, before he can reach for his own pistol, is shot and killed by one of the officials. In the morning, one of Hem's other friends calls Hem to tell him that Lucas has been killed and that Hem must move his accounts.Later that morning, Hem, Ed, Gregorio, and Mary are on the fishing boat. Hem tells Ed about Lucas's murder, while a Spanish-speaking military official watches from the shore with binoculars. Mary stands watch while Ed, Gregorio, and Ed dump large-sized weapons into the ocean from the boat's cargo holds. A Coast Guard cutter rapidly approaches with U.S. officials on it. They discuss how they will be pleased to catch Hemingway with weapons, and, even if they don't find weapons on Hem's ship, they will plant them there. The FBI agent, John Fletcher, says he will be glad to see Hemingway in handcuffs.Hem explains to Mary that he's been helping to carry weapons for Lucas, who is supplying Cuban rebels.
The Coast Guard sends a small boat over and military personnel boards Hem's fishing boat. The lead tells Hem he appreciates his books but explains he has orders to search. Fletcher gives the order to plant weapons, but he sees Ed on the boat, and, knowing Ed can testify to the search not producing any weapons, gives up.Ed, Mary, and Hem arrive at the Floridita to a large crowd of tourists, photographers, and admirers. He pushes through to find the restaurant full of local friends wishing him a happy birthday. He seems pleased, especially after drinking a few daiquiris. He tells Ed he might break his record of 16 that night. He advises Ed to let his work get famous, not himself; he says it became much harder, nearly impossible, to write after winning the Nobel prize.On the ride home, Mary expresses her displeasure with Hem's repeated stories. Hemingway, staggeringly drunk, calls her a name, she calls him impotent and useless, and they begin another horrendous argument.Having a quiet drink with Evan, Ed says he doesn't understand how they can love each other one minute and say such horrible things the next. Evan explains that most marriages are like being under siege, that people are unwilling to set aside their egos to truly love another.That night, Hem huddles in the bathroom, miserable, with a bottle of alcohol.In the morning, Ed hears a commotion in the living room and rushes in to find Mary wrestling a pistol out of Hem's hands. Ed manages to grab it and tells Hem he will have to kill him to get the pistol from him. He says he loves Hem. Evan stands up and says he loves Hem as well and they won't let him kill himself. Hem lunges after the gun and wrestles it out of Ed's hands. Three people watch the fourth with a pistol. Hem says he wants to die but when Mary says she can't live without him, he soften and they embrace. Hem drops the pistol and walks into the other room. Ed looks beyond stunned. From the other room, they hear the sounds of Hem's typing, the first time in a long time.Ed is back in Miami, emotionally exhausted. He reflects on Hem's advice about thinking about what he wants. When he arrives at work, he walks straight to Deb, who tells him to go away. He kisses her and says he loves her. After a moment of hesitation, she kisses him back.In voiceover, Ed explains how important Hem was in his life. He reports that a year and a half later, Hem committed suicide with his shotgun in his home in Ketchum, Idaho.The final credits indicate that the character of Ed Myers was based on the real life of writer Denne Bart Petitclerc. After Hemingway's death, Denne and his wife moved to Ketchum to be close to Mary Hemingway. He lived there for the next 35 years. Denne died of cancer in 2006."

Once I Was a Beehive,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4002772/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After losing her father to cancer, a teenage girl reluctantly joins her new stepcousin at a summer camp for Latter-day Saint (Mormon) girls. Lane Speer is a 16-year-old girl who spends her family vacations camping in the mountains. She takes the memories for granted until she loses her father to cancer. Only a year later, Lane is still reeling from her father's death as her mother marries a guy that Lane hardly knows - a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. To top it off, while they are on their honeymoon, they arrange to have her stay with her LDS step-aunt who takes her away to a Bible-themed girls' camp with a bunch of young LDS girls. Confronted with memories of camping with her family, she tries to find peace with her new surroundings and deal with her father's death. Since the credits say the movie was filmed in Utah and many of the characters are Mormons, it can be assumed the movie was also set in Utah.Lane and her parents Robert and Audrey are going camping. Lane is an adorable but slightly rebellious teen who, despite the gorgeous scenery her father keeps pointing out, remains focused on her phone. She would rather be at something called Battle of the Bands. When the family arrives at their destination, Lane must give up the phone and enjoy the experience. Which she does. Close-ups of the back of the SUV show evidence of Robert's Christian faith, including the fish symbol, and as narrator, Lane explains that her father has brought others to this place to help them, because of his faith. Robert shows Lane how to do what she needs to do because he won't always be around.How right Robert was. Seven months after the tumor was discovered, the family is at his funeral. It is not clear exactly when the movie's first scenes took place in relation to this event.However, Audrey meets Tristan in a grief support group, and they are about to get married one year later. Lane is acting childish and refuses to ever accept Tristan. To make matters worse, the honeymoon will be a three-week cruise and although Lane claims that at 16 she can be on her own, her mother is not convinced. Lane will spend that time with Tristan's sister Holly. One more thing: although Lane's family is not Mormon, Tristan's family is. Audrey tries hard to show Lane how much she loves her and this helps.Lane grudgingly attends a dinner before the wedding but has to go off and be by herself. That is where she meets Phoebe, Holly's neurotic and very intelligent daughter, who has numerous phobias (she is hiding because the building is not designed for earthquakes) and must rely on a tiny service dog Roxy to keep her calm. Lane is nicer to Phoebe than most people and it looks like both of them will be good for each other.The wedding happens and Lane is doing okay, until the couple leaves and then Lane can't stop crying. She has to be carried to the home where she will spend the next several weeks and put in bed. Then she oversleeps and gets up around noon.If there weren't enough problems in Lane's life, the perky Sister Carrie Carrington shows up trying to persuade Phoebe to go to a girls' camp which will last several days. Phoebe does not want to go and Holly does not want to make her go. With Lane staying with the family, naturally she is invited too even though she is not a Mormon like the rest. Eventually, both girls agree to go, mainly because each one feels more comfortable having the other there.And what happens next is pretty much what one would expect: a van pulling a trailer that resembles Noah's Ark, and a group of teenage girls singing corny Christian songs. Not Contemporary Christian, but the type of corny songs that have been around for many years.Lane as the narrator introduces the girls. Bree, Carrie's daughter, is in charge and won't let anyone forget it. Paige is her best friend. Charlotte is another of the ""elite"" but doesn't have nearly the confidence of the other two. Hannah has an attitude and ignores everyone else while listening to bands no one ever heard of while wearing headphones. The other girls like One Direction but she surely does not. Mindy also has an attitude but is more social and does impressions. Finally, Lane claims sisters Maleka, Mykelle and Makenna were named by their parents when they were playing Scrabble and wanted to use the same set of letters multiple times.The van makes one last stop before Spring Lake. A motorcycle arrives with the Bishop and an older woman (Nedra is the only name left in the credits) who is not your typical Christian, and yet she does help teach the girls morals. Lane wants to ride with her so the Bishop can go the rest of the way with the group. It is later that Lane confesses she was thinking about asking to go home at that point.When the group arrives, the girls have to put together three tents. Each group may ask for help from the other groups but they cannot be helped by the adults--Carrie, Holly, the Bishop, and Nedra, who get to sleep in the ""ark"". Surprisingly, Lane is quite good at knowing what to do after being taught by her father, and Phoebe knows a lot as well. As first year members of the group, they are the ""Beehives"", which gives the movie its name. Phoebe has a secret: she just couldn't leave Roxy behind. The dog is in her luggage and she pleads with Lane to keep her secret.The elite girls think they know what they are doing. After all, they are in charge. One wonders about protection from the rain, but ""it, like never rains."" So naturally, that first night, it will rain, and the elite girls run to the ark and pound on the door, but the adults are all wearing headphones and no one can hear them. Then the second tent collapses. All of the girls end up in the one tent that survived, the one built by the Beehives.The next morning there is lots of work to do and clothes that need to dry out. And the girls will go on a hike to the glacier where Carrie has promised a special surprise.Two rangers show up and Charlotte and Holly (but she's married!) both have an obvious crush on these good-looking men.At last it is time for the hike. But the group gets lost. Eventually, Lane looks at the map and figures out what to do, and the group arrives at the glacier. It's actually more like a place where it has just snowed, and there is enough snow for snowballs and--this is Carrie's surprise, as she brought fruit flavors--Sno-cones. Bree is annoyed that Lane is getting so much attention, so naturally she gets hit by a snowball.The group is very tired when the return to camp and, except for Lane, they go to sleep. Lane helps Nedra with cooking their meal, using a very delicious recipe she was taught. Bree gets angry when Lane has done what was supposed to be her job, but the girls love the food.There is more work to do the next day. Fences need repairing, and it is a big letdown when two different rangers show up who are not good-looking. This time when the girls return to camp, there is evidence a bear attacked. Phoebe has to admit she brought Roxy, and Roxy is missing. She goes off looking for the dog, even though the group has been warned the bear might be around. Lane follows Phoebe, and Bree follows both of them. Bree tries praying and Lane is frustrated that people think prayer has any value. But then the bear shows up and they have to do what they were taught. It is a tense scene but when they get away safe, Lane and Bree are thinking differently. Phoebe finds Roxy's service dog vest and is devastated.So the group has some choices to make. They can stay despite what the bear did, or they can go home. It takes some persuasion but the others agree, and finally Phoebe is convinced to stay.There are more fun activities. The girls must find the Ark using clues that involve Bible verses. Working together, they are able to figure things out. Phoebe is the most helpful of all and the others have to admit she has done a lot for them. The girls reach their goal.And the Bishop shows up with Roxy, who was quite terrified when he found her.Sitting around the campfire at the end, the girls all give their testimonies. The audience sees the last one from Phoebe, who despite all her quirky behavior really does have a strong faith. Then Lane asks to speak, and admits while she is not one of them and doesn't believe the way Mormons do, the experience has really been good for her. Bree asks to speak again and says they brought Lane and Phoebe along to help them and Lane and Phoebe have helped the group as much as the group has helped them."

She is established as a foul-mouthed woman with an Ohioan accent who perpetually wears her Team USA jacket.Hope heads out, first stopping by the mail truck her father drives for a living. She opens a handful of birthday cards and steals the cash inside. Her first stop is Sbarro Pizza at the mall's food court, where she orders a Mountain Dew (the employee asks if she wants Diet like most women but she rudely tells him she didn't say Diet). When she is charged $9.30 for the meal, the owner comes by and points out that she's on the wall -- where an autographed picture of her is hanging. Thus her meals are always on the house. Hope is revealed to be a major celebrity in her small town of Amherst, Ohio, with the city sign even boasting that ""Bronze Medalist Hope Ann Gregory"" lives there. This special treatment carries over to the local soda shop she often eats at, complete with her own reserved parking spot. While drinking a milkshake, a young gymnast, named Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson), and the gym manager named Ben (Thomas Middleditch) spot Hope through the window. Maggie does an impressive routine outside the window and then enters, gushing about how she's a big fan of Hope's. Hope recognizes Ben as being ""Twitchy"", a kid she used to torment over his facial tic, which he still has; he seems to have always had a crush on her. Maggie tells Hope she's a gymnast training with the same coach and that Hope has been an inspiration to her since her father died at five years old. Hope replies by bragging that her mother died when she was a baby.When Hope returns home, her dad politely tells her she can't steal from his mail truck anymore. Stan tells her she should get a job coaching gymnastics and she points out that she was currently on ""Dancing with the Stars"" and is a star, not a coach. Nonetheless, he suggests retracting her weekly allowance. She balks at this, complaining that she needs that $700 a week to get by. They settle down with him holding a DAD'S GREATEST DAD mug that she made for him in grade school. They watch television in which it's revealed that the coach who trained Hope to the Olympics has killed herself. Hope is nonchalant in response to this, saying she hates the coach.The next day, Hope goes to meet her drug dealer to score some weed. She tries to steal from her dad's mail truck again but it now has a lock on it. After she gets the hook-up, she comes home to learn that her father has received a letter, stipulating that in her former coach's will, Hope was left half a million dollars, on the condition she coach Maggie to the Olympic games, regardless of how she places. Hope reads the letter and tells him it says $500,000, not half a million. Yet she decides to take up the offer. She stops by Maggie's trailer home and meets her mom (Cecily Strong) and tries to convince her to let her train Maggie. They both agree, excitedly, as they are fans of hers. Maggie points out she needs a ride to the gym because she is too young to drive. She says she usually gets there by 7:00 AM but Hope promises to pick her up around noon.Their first training session, Hope goes out of her way to sabotage Maggie's chances of success. She encourages her to binge on junk food, pointing out that male athletes do the same thing in other sports. A boy flirts with Maggie and instead of telling her not to get distracted, Hope demands that Maggie be intimate with him. When they arrive at the gym, Ben/Twitchy is there. Hope says she's going to give her a new routine even though Maggie already has one she's been working on with her former coach. She asks Maggie if she knows what the strongest part of her has to be to win -- Maggie guesses mental constitution but Hope corrects her, ""Your mind,"" which is the same thing. Instead of actually running through the routine, Hope encourages her to lay down and visualize her performing it; she never runs through the actual routine.The next day, they have to get to the gym early because a committee member is going to arrive to evaluate Maggie. Hope blends some weed into a green smoothie she's making for Maggie and then decides to throw in the whole bag. She tells Maggie that she must drink the whole thing. When they arrive at the studio, Maggie's eyes are bloodshot and she runs around the gym, completely high. Ben is disappointed and questions whether Hope is the best coach for her. Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan) arrives; he is an equally conceded gymnast-turned-coach who won gold and silver at the Olympics and bickers with Hope. He took her virginity right after she won the bronze medal and they are now sworn enemies. Hope decides to quit her training and calls her dad at home, asking if she'll still get the money if she doesn't finish the task. She is told the conditions explicitly state that she has to succeed or she gets nothing. Because of this, Hope decides to change her tune -- she finds Maggie and her mom at home, talking to Stan who tries to encourage Maggie's mom to let him coach instead. Surprisingly, Maggie and her mom decide to stick with Hope.Hope tries a different approach -- she encourages Maggie to stop kissing the boy she initially told her to. She puts her on a strict diet but tells her to sniff Hope's nachos before eating her celery stick, a trick she knew from her own gymnastics days. She gives Maggie pointers on how to do a cutesy routine to impress the judges. And how to stick a landing.Impressed, Ben begins to like the new Hope and the two decide to go out on a date. He takes her to the mall food court from before but after hours, using a kiosk selling candles to spark a mood. They play Truth or Dare and she dares him to steal a punch card from one of the restaurants -- and then to punch them out so she gets a free meal. Eventually the game gets more serious where she talks about how crushed she was when she finished rehabilitating from her broken leg and was told by her now deceased coach that she was a has-been and her career is over.Maggie makes it into the nationals in Toronto, Canada and everyone gears up to attend except Maggie's mom who has to stay home and work. Ben and Hope continue getting closer and Lance is there, too. An interviewer asks Hope if she is coaching because she is no longer a star and Hope gets upset. She later admits to Ben that she's afraid that if Maggie succeeds, she won't be the city's local celebrity anymore. He tells her he thinks it's great that she's coaching Maggie especially since the gymnastics studio isn't going to be around much longer because of money problems. He suspects that this is why the studio's owner killed herself because she was going through hardships financially and was broke. Hope now realizes that she doesn't have $500,000 to pay her.Hope finds her dad in her hotel room and demands to know if the letter was real. Stan finally admits that he falsified the document to encourage Hope to get a job and make something of herself. She is angry with him but for the first time, he stands up to her, calling her a ""spoiled bitch"".Upset, Hope gets drunk in at a bar and Lance begins to flirt with her. Back in her motel room, they have a hot five-minute sex session, which includes them doing gymnastics moves in the fully in the nude (i.e., he does moves on her like she's a pommel horse; she does a front flip into a handstand and they 69). It ends with her holding onto rings while he bangs her against the window. Ben is in the parking lot and sees this happening.The next day, Ben is livid with her and tells her he saw her having sex. He wants nothing to do with her, which crushes Hope. Lance admits that he's always hated her and he had sex with her so he could ruin her relationship with Ben. He wants to take Maggie to the Olympics and steal Hope's small town celebrity away from her.Maggie is about to perform her routine. Hope sees Maggie's mom high in the stands; she asks Hope to tell Maggie she's there. Hope finds Maggie ready to perform for the judges; she begins to tell her 'Your mom--"" and stops. Maggie asks, ""What about my mom?"" Hope replies: ""She won't be here because she was killed in a plane crash."" Maggie begins to cry and when she goes to perform, she can't do it as she's too upset.However.... this is all just a fantasy in Hope's mind -- she tells Maggie the truth that her mom is there as a surprise, which makes Maggie smile. She gives a great performance and goes on to win a gold medal, allowing her to move on to the Olympics.Back in Amherst, the town now changes the sign to ""Home of Maggie Townsend, gold medalist"" and a smaller sign, ""and Hope Ann Greggory, bronze medalist."" Everything Hope feared has come true. At the local soda shop, Hope watches on TV as Maggie holds a press conference, telling her she couldn't have done it without her coach, Hope Ann Greggory... but then adds that being a gold medalist is going to be much more effective on her path to Olympics and announces she'll be moving to Los Angeles and trained by Lance instead. The soda shop owner calls Maggie a bitch and Hope acts somber. Hope then walks out after paying for her milkshake.At the local mall, kids are lined up to get an autograph from Maggie who is a no show because she has moved out of town. Hope stands on the table and gives a speech to the kids using foul language but encouraging them to join the local gymnastics studio.Ben shows up to the gymnasium, which is slated to close, but instead finds a swarm of girls and their moms outside. Hope is selling them gym clothes and T-shirts and says she won't be granting any change; all profits will go to keeping the studio around.In the final scene set several months later, the gymnasium is still open and Hope is now the official coach in town teaching gymnastics to young girls. The city changes the sign back to simply ""home of bronze medalist Hope Ann Greggory."" But Hope isn't that great of a coach. During a lunch break, an ice cream truck comes by and Hope sends all the athletes outside to get some for themselves.In a post write subtitle sequence, we're told that Maggie didn't win a gold medal at the next Summer Olympics, and had to quit gymnastics after having Lance's baby. Also, that none of the girls that Hope trained at her new gym ever went on to win a medal at any event."

Detective Byomkesh Bakshy!,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3447364/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Detective Byomkesh Bakshy is set in the 2nd World War torn Calcutta during the 1940s. Enter a magical world of nostalgia and 'Expect the Unexpected'. ""CALCUTTA 1943 A WAR - A MYSTERY - and A DETECTIVE"" Detective Byomkesh Bakshy is based on the early exploits of India's first true-blue detective, created by Bengali bestseller writer Saradindu Bandyopadhyay. Directed by Dibakar Banerjee, the film is set in the Second World War torn Calcutta during the 1940s and follows the first adventure of Byomkesh Bakshy (Sushant Singh Rajput), fresh out of college, as he pits himself against an evil genius who is out to destroy the world. Using his wits against the most villainous arch criminal the world has seen, in a world of murder, international political intrigue and seduction.—Official source Synopsis as provided by Srijana Mitra Das in the Times of India (4 April 2015):It's 1942 and Calcutta is ruled by the British Raj. Its underworld is ruled by Chinese gangsters smuggling opium from Shanghai. A vicious fight breaks out within one such gang at the Calcutta docks where gangster Yun Gong brutally blinds one rival and is then thought to be killed.Meanwhile, bright student Byomkesh Bakshy (Sushant) is approached by Ajit Banerjee for help in finding his missing father Bhuvan babu. Initially, Byomkesh refuses and even suggests Bhuvan may be mixed up in dodgy business, at which Ajit angrily slaps him. The same day, Byomkesh's girlfriend Leela tells him she's marrying a well-placed chemistry student instead of him.Byomkesh seeks out Ajit and agrees to take his case. He visits Bhuvan's lodging home and meets Dr. Guha and Kanai Dao who legally sells opium. He also finds Bhuvan's beloved paan box is still in his room, hidden by his roommate who's oddly addicted to the paan masala. Byomkesh is convinced Bhuvan has been killed as his box and money are still in his room.Byomkesh visits the Sikdar chemical factory, now shut down, where Bhuvan used to work. There he sees film star Angoori taking a swim. She's amused by him and offers him a ride home. In the car, when he asks if she knows of Bhuvan, she pulls her handbag nervously to herself. In her studio, as she shoots, Byomkesh opens the bag and finds letters from cut-out newspapers, blackmailing the factory owner Sikdar babu, a friend of Angoori's.He's convinced Sikdar has killed Bhuvan when the latter tried to blackmail him. Byomkesh goes back to the factory with Dr. Guha and they pretend to the watchmen that they've come to fix a mouse problem. Poking around in the factory, they find Bhuvan's slashed, decomposed body stuffed into a machine.Sikdar is brought in by police commissioner Wilkie for questioning - but just then, Byomkesh discovers he's wrong and Sikdar is being framed as the newspapers only reach the lodging house at 8:30 AM every day while the blackmail letters were stamped at 7:30 AM at the post office, showing a false detail. Dr. Guha vanishes but sends Byomkesh a note, admitting he was blackmailing Sikdar, not Bhuvan babu.Sikdar is freed and Byomkesh follows him home but is detained by Angoori who tries to kiss him. He gently rebuffs her but when he goes to meet Sikdar, the latter is suddenly poisoned and dies. Suspicion falls on his rebellious nephew Sukumar who has opened a rival political party and is militant about India's freedom from the British. Sukumar's sister Satyawati pleads with Byomkesh to help her brother, who's driven off earlier in a cab used by Byomkesh.Byomkesh finds the Sardarji cabbie Sukumar drove off with, reaching a Japanese dentist Dr. Watnabe's clinic where the secretary says Watanabe is at the temple. Byomkesh and Ajit go to the temple, pretending they have a link with Sukumar's political party, but Watanabe is suspicious. Another member of Sukumar's party recognizes them and follows them at Watanabe's orders. Byomkesh and Ajit change their costumes and then follow the student back to the dentist's - where they find the secretary and student brutally murdered with a shadowy character escaping in a car.Byomkesh takes a paper out from the student's pocket - it's a map of Calcutta's river route. They return to the lodgers' house where Byomkesh feels low. He tries some of Bhuvan babu's paan masala and finds it is laced with heroin. Making a wall-painting of the entire crime, Byomkesh has the heroin presence confirmed by Leela's chemist husband who says this heroin is very hard to trace and made from opium - which Dao, who admits he's an undercover cop, tells Byomkesh has practically vanished from the city.Byomkesh finds there are two plots together here. The first is the Chinese gang warfare over opium, turned into untraceable heroin by Bhuvan babu's secret formula. The second is of Sukumar's political party being told by the Japanese army that they will land in Calcutta via its river routes and liberate the city from the British.The link between the two deadly plots is the mysterious Yun Gong.Meanwhile, Dr. Guha returns to the lodging house and tells Byomkesh he's a nationalist fighting for India's freedom. He offers Byomkesh a role to play in the struggle and says other peoples' murders are the price for this. Byomkesh asks Dao to take him to the Chinese gang which tells him about the deadly Gong. Byomkesh divulges all the facts to commissioner Wilkie and asks him to sound all the air raid sirens of Calcutta at 4 AM on Basant Panchami. He is convinced the Japanese will attack Calcutta through its river routes then and Gong will help them, so that they let him control the hugely rich opium trade.Byomkesh sends Dr. Guha a letter inviting him to the lodging house. Dr. Guha, Sukumar, Watanabe and Satyawati come there, as does Angoori who's told Byomkesh she's loved Gong from their days together in Rangoon and has been trying to mislead Byomkesh on Gong's orders. She hasn't seen him recently though and doesn't recognize him - not even when Byomkesh reveals Dr. Guha is actually the dreaded Gong.Angoori tries to stop Gong from helping the Japanese conquer Calcutta but he brutally murders her. The Chinese gang hidden by Byomkesh in the lodging house then attacks and takes away Gong who gets distracted by the air sirens going off. Byomkesh tells the Japanese doctor their game is up and the British army will crush their forces if they try to attack. He gives up.Byomkesh then tells Satywati he wants to marry her as the price for proving Sukumar's innocence. Meanwhile, Gong manages to kill the entire Chinese gang and escapes - promising Byomkesh revenge."

The problem begins when she decides to perform in front of a real audience.—Andres Garza Marguerite, Baronne Dumont (possibly a nod here to the majestic Margaret Dumont in the Marx Bros films) may have married her husband Georges for his title (and he her for her money) but she genuinely loves him; and her horribly misplaced musical ambition is to make him proud.

He even uses photos to blackmail washed-up gay tenor Pezzini to take the job of Marguerite's voice coach, to the despair of Georges who had hoped Pezzini would tell the truth.Pezzini makes the most of his enforced role, bringing his retinue to stay and putting Marguerite through a variety of bizarre exercises.

He resolves to attend the concert, though dreading the ridicule. Marguerite begins; the house freezes then collapses into incredulous laughter.

He believes the parents to be innocent, and methodically builds a case against the father's resentful assistant. His team uses narco tests, attempting to prove that the assistant and his two accomplices committed the murders. On 22 June 2008, he officially exonerates the parents, and Ramesh Tandon is released from the jail. The narrative also briefly discusses the dissolution of Kumar's marriage with Reema (Tabu).Just as Ashwin Kumar is about to conclude his investigation, his senior officer retires and a new CDI chief takes over. ACP Vedant, in his greed to get a promotion, starts working against Kumar. This leads to an altercation between the two officers, resulting in Kumar's suspension. On 9 July 2008, CDI hands over the case to a new probe team led by Kumar's former boss Paul (Atul Kumar), who concludes that the parents committed the murders. In the final act, rival camps (of Kumar and Paul), with opposing hypotheses, make their cases before the CDI chief. On 20 February 2011, CDI files a closure report in Ghaziabad court, naming parents as the prime suspects, but states that the evidence is insufficient to initiate prosecution. On 15 March, the Tandons file a protest plea opposing CDI's report. On 25 March, the judge rejects the closure report and makes the parents an accused in the case. The trial begins on 8 June 2012, and the Tandons are convicted for the murders on 26 November 2013."

April and the Extraordinary World,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3422078/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It's 1941 but France is trapped in the nineteenth century, governed by steam and Napoleon V, where scientists vanish mysteriously. Avril (Marion Cotillard), a teenage girl, goes in search of her missing scientist parents. In 1941, the world is radically different from the one we know from history books. Geopolitics has developed strangely: Napoleon V rules France and, for the last 70 years, scholars have been mysteriously disappearing, depriving mankind of their inventions. Without radio, television, electricity, aviation, and the combustion engine, the world is mired in outdated technology, dozing in the previous century's knowhow dominated by coal and steam. In this bizarre universe, Avril (Marion Cotillard), a teenage girl, Darwin (Philippe Katerine), her talking cat, Pops (Jean Rochefort), her grandfather, and Julius (Marc-André Grondin), a young scoundrel and police informer, go off in search of Avril's parents, two of the missing scientists. The quartet will face many dangers and mysteries in this strange new Rigged World.—Polly_Kat Paris, 1941. A family of scientists is on the brink of discovering a powerful invincibility serum when all of a sudden, the parents are mysteriously abducted, leaving their young daughter April behind. Ten years later, April is living alone with her precious cat, Darwin, continuing her family's research, and soon finds herself at the centre of a bizarre conspiracy. In Paris in 1870, an event splits the timeline from the one we're familiar with. Napoleon III, preparing for war with Prussia, has tasked a scientist with developing a drug -- dubbed the ultimate serum -- that will make his soldiers indestructible, able to recover almost instantly from wounds and disease. The emperor visits Professor Gustave Franklin's lab to gauge his progress. Franklin has a couple of creatures in a murky test chamber; he calls them Rodrigue (French voice:Benoît Brière; English voice:J.K. Simmons) and Chimène (French voice:Anne Coesens; English voice:Susan Sarandon). (Rodrigue and Chimène are named for characters from legends based on the life of the Spanish hero El Cid -- comparable to Romeo and Juliet.) We can't see the test subjects, but we hear them say a few words. When Franklin reports that he hasn't yet identified the right formula for the ultimate serum, the emperor loses his temper and orders his henchman to shoot Rodrigue and Chimène, without waiting to hear what Franklin urgently wants to tell him. The movie's timeline diverges from our own when the test subjects escape -- we never get a good look at them, but they seem to be four-legged and low to the ground -- and the ensuing explosion kills Franklin and Napoleon III.The immediate result is positive: Napoleon IV signs a peace treaty that averts the Franco-Prussian War, which didn't go well for France and is generally considered to have set the stage for World War I. Before long, though, scientists and inventors start to disappear. Technologies they would have developed -- notably radio, electricity, and petroleum-powered internal combustion and diesel engines -- never appear. Europe uses up its coal to power its steam engines, then consumes its forests. When the story resumes in 1931, France is planning to invade North America for its trees. The French government requires all remaining scientists to work for the state; their priority is to develop new weapons for the coming North American war.The descendants of Professor Franklin are renegades. His son Prosper (French voice:Jean Rochefort; English voice:Tony Robinow), now an old man who wants his family to call him Pops, has continued the search for the ultimate serum in secret. Prosper's son Paul (French voice:Olivier Gourmet; English voice:Mark Camacho) and Paul's wife Annette (French and English voices:Macha Grenon) are in it with him; even their young daughter April tries to help. When we first see Prosper, he's in a conservatory visiting a tree. When Paul comes to bring him back to work, Prosper says he's drawn to the tree and can't help coming every day.The Franklins are distilling the latest version of the ultimate serum when the gendarmes -- police -- break in on them, lead by Inspector Gaspar Pizoni (French voice:Bouli Lanners; English voice:Paul Giamatti). Annette hides the serum by injecting it into April's snowglobe and the family flees, Prosper in a steam-powered car and April, her parents, and her talking cat Darwin (French voice:Philippe Katerine; English voice:Tony Hale) in a police dirigible. Pops gets away; the rest of the family makes it onto a cable car bound for Germany, but the cops catch up with them before the cable car leaves Paris. The cable car is attacked by a strange dark cloud that strikes the police and April's parents with lightning that seems carefully aimed. April and Darwin escape in a kind of lifeboat just before the cable car explodes. In the aftermath Inspector Pizoni, who survived the explosion with injuries, is demoted to agent for bungling the capture of the Franklins. Paul and Annette are presumed dead, but Pizoni vows to win back his rank by finding Prosper.Ten years later, April (French voice:Marion Cotillard; English voice:Angela Galuppo) and Darwin are living on their own in the head of a huge metal statue of one of the Napoleons. Scientists are still disappearing. April makes her way around Paris stealing things she needs, and is followed by a young man, Julius (French voice:Marc-André Grondin; English voice:Tod Fennell), who is Pizoni's informant. (Pizoni hopes that April will lead them to Prosper.) She doesn't know Julius is following her, but the entrance to the statue is well hidden so he loses track of her. April is still working to perfect the ultimate serum, motivated by the knowledge that her beloved Darwin is dying -- his lungs have been damaged by all the soot in the air, product of decades of burning coal and wood in huge quantities. April reads to him (""Puss in Boots,"" another story about a talking cat) while they wait to see whether her latest formula will cure him. It doesn't, so she goes out again to steal ingredients for the next attempt.A fairground seems promising. One of the booths features a magic show that includes some chemical effects. (And, oddly, a pigeon outfitted to transmit audio and video.) April sneaks backstage during the show and finds what she needs, but the magician's assistant catches her and raises the alarm. April runs, with the magician's assistant in hot pursuit. (In a remote listening post, a shadowy figure orders that a spy rat be sent in.) Luckily for April, Julius has picked up her trail again and has recently been told by Pizoni to shield her from the consequences of stealing -- she can't lead them to Prosper if she's in jail. Grasping her predicament, Julius runs up to April saying ""Honey, where have you been? I've looked all over for you!"" and kisses her. This distracts her pursuer so Julius (who has previously exhibited some skill at sleight of hand tricks) can extract the stolen chemicals from her bag. When the magician's assistant looks into her bag, there's nothing incriminating to be found and they get away. April is baffled by Julius's help, seems uninterested in making friends, and ditches him as soon as he returns her chemicals. He follows her, as does a rat wearing the same kind of spy equipment we saw on the pigeon. Julius loses her again near the statue; the rat doesn't.In her lair, watched by the spy rat, April whips up another batch of what she hopes is really the ultimate serum and feeds it to Darwin. Julius, who's hanging around outside feeling frustrated, happens to notice that the statue's eyes -- April's windows -- are lit up. It's gotten dark and she's forgotten to pull down the shades.When it seems Darwin is getting worse instead of better, April loses it. She throws the vial of failed serum, which breaks and drips on the spy rat. She sweeps the distilling apparatus off the table, breaking and throwing things left and right -- including her snow globe, which leaks a little. Darwin slurps up the liquid and goes limp again -- he's almost too weak to move now. Moments later, as April weeps over his impending death, Darwin leaps up and announces that he's cured -- all signs of weakness and coughing are gone. Even his voice sounds stronger. Darwin tells April he drank some of the water from the snow globe, and April realizes her parents must have hidden their final version of the serum there. The mysterious masters of the spy rat see and hear all of this.Suddenly Julius appears at the window -- he's climbed the outside of the statue to find April. She's annoyed but helps him in rather than letting him fall to his death. They're distracted by a voice emanating from the spy rat. It's Paul, April's father, warning that she's in danger -- she should leave right away, go to the oak tree, and wait for Pops. Darwin pounces on the rat, apparently killing it and interrupting the transmission.At the window, Julius notices a strange dark cloud that looks very much like the one that attacked the Franklin's cable car 10 years before. It approaches quickly and starts to cut through the metal of the statue's head. April, Darwin and Julius flee down the stairs to the street and get away.In a control room, people in red coveralls monitor transmissions from all over the world. Their bosses, who seem to be robots or cyborgs -- we don't see them clearly -- discuss what just happened. A female voice says one of the scientists took control of the spy rat; a male voice, calling her ""my love,"" replies that she's far too lenient with the humans and this scientist should be punished. The bosses go outside to a cell in the jungle. Its walls are made of red laser beams and inside is April's father Paul. The female voice asks Paul what he said to his daughter -- they want April's help with a project they're working on. Paul just smiles until they confront him with Annette, who looks angry.April, Darwin, and Julius eventually make their way to Julius's hideout, where they spend the night. Julius gives up his bed to April. Julius is a little sweet on her and offers to help, but April is dismayed at being thrown together with him and keeps saying she doesn't need friends, though Darwin reminds her how Julius has already helped them.April puzzles over her father's message, wondering where she can find an oak. Julius knows where to go, noting there's only one tree left in Paris. The next day they find the tree in a large conservatory and sit there for hours before an old man in a gas mask (to protect him from the sooty air) sits nearby and speaks to them. It's Pops. He gives them directions to a safe place but tells them he'll leave first and they should give him an hour's head start. April is impatient and leaves with Julius and Darwin soon after Pops departs.Meanwhile, April's parents are arguing. Annette wants to bring April into their unnamed project; she believes in the project and feels that April will be safer with them. Paul has lost confidence in the project and wants to keep April as far away from it as possible.In a huge hangar or warehouse, April and Julius find a large single-family house with an odd metal tunnel for an entrance. April seems to recognize the house. Pops arrives right behind them and scolds them for coming so quickly; he's afraid they'll be followed. April explains that she's had a message from her father, and hopes that her mother is alive too.The mysterious boss with the feminine voice questions Annette. She's disappointed that Paul wouldn't tell Annette anything, but assures Annette that they won't hurt him.In Pops' study, they're trying to figure out what's going on. Pops decides to go back to the statue to retrieve the spy rat. He won't let April come along, but tells her there are clothes for her upstairs. She discovers a wardrobe full of pink dresses, identical but in different sizes. She puts on one that fits and goes down to ask Julius what he thinks (it's a very different look for her -- she's been wearing boys' clothes up to this point), but can't find him: he's gone off to report to Pizoni. Julius agrees to give up Pops to Pizoni but lies that he doesn't know where April is. At the same time April fools with an untested electrical device Pops was working on; as soon as it powers up, the red-suits in the control center detect it and send a spy rat to pin down its location. Julius comes back in time to be zapped by the device before April manages to rip out its power cable.Pops is checking out the plaza around the statue when Pizoni catches him. Pizoni's very pleased with himself and gives Pops a lump of coal as a memento of their previous meeting, when Pops escaped the police raid by climbing a pile of coal and scrambling up a coal chute. Darwin, who has followed Pops, sees all this and trails them to a meeting with Pizoni's superior officer. The meeting doesn't go as Pizoni hoped. Though his boss is happy to have Prosper, he reminds Pizoni that he was told to stay away from the scientists and has him arrested. In the commotion, Darwin gets Prosper's attention and Prosper tells him ""In case anything goes wrong, on my world globe, Uruguay! with a U for urgent!"" Darwin also overhears that Prosper and Pizoni are being sent to Fort-la-Latte.Darwin high-tails it back to the house, where Julius is telling April he has to leave. Before he can get away, Darwin reports that Prosper has been captured and is bound for Fort-la-Latte. At Fort-la-Latte, a research station where many of the French government's captive scientists are working, Pizoni is locked up and Prosper is taken around to look at various research projects. A damaged airplane grabs his attention. It was found wrecked, its origin is unknown, and its technology is unfamiliar to the French scientists. Pops sets to work repairing it. Back at the house, April uses an atlas to locate Fort-la-Latte (a real medieval castle) on the coast of Brittany. The dark cloud attacks the hangar and starts cutting it up to get at the house -- the mysterious bosses have tracked April down.Darwin presses Uruguay on the globe and the house immediately encloses itself in armor, the desk in the study flips over to reveal a control console, and a recording of Pops' voice plays on the Victrola: ""Dear visitor, if you're hearing this, it's because the situation is critical, so welcome to my metamansion. To steer the metamansion to the location of your choice, type your destination on the keyboard. For any other information, see the user's manual."" (A large book pops out of a slot on the console.) A laser from the dark cloud is trying to cut through the metamansion's armor, so April wastes no time in entering ""Fort La Latte"" on the control console's keyboard. The house sprouts legs (à laHowl's Moving Castle) and runs off, dodging their pursuers and jumping into the River Seine -- the armor keeps out water as well as lasers, and the metamansion can swim as well as it can run. They head for the coast of Brittany to rescue Pops.The dark cloud that's been after them seems to give up, gaining altitude as it dissipates to reveal that it contains a plane -- or aerocopter -- that looks like the one Pops is trying to repair at Fort-la-Latte. Over the radio, the mysterious bosses discuss April's escape. The female boss calls the male boss, who's flying the aerocopter, Rodrigue.At Fort-la-Latte, Pops explains electricity to the government scientists as he repairs the damaged aerocopter. The area starts to flood because the metamansion has punctured the castle's foundation. April and company sneak in to find Pops, who's having so much fun with the aerocopter that he doesn't hear them calling at first. He gets it working and they all get aboard and escape from Fort-la-Latte as the guards shoot at them. The metamansion is lost.Once they're aloft, Pops explains that they don't know where they are and starts to work on the guidance mechanism while he questions Julius about why Pizoni knew where to find him. Julius admits that he turned Pops in because the alternative was jail. Pops doesn't seem too troubled by this, but April is furious.Pops' tinkering triggers a video and we finally get a good visual of the two mysterious bosses: they're lizards wearing armored, human-shaped suits, with their tails hanging out at waist level. In the video, the female boss says ""Dear scientists, welcome aboard. We are your new masters, Rodrigue and Chimène. You are being guided to a safe haven where your talents will be appreciated and put to good use, in pleasant surroundings far away from the follies of your government. All science is most valuable to us. Like your cruel species, we have learned that knowledge is power. Your science will help us achieve supreme power through technological superiority. The nature of your work will be explained later.""In the control center, the red-suits listen to April's reaction: ""Lizards? Those lizards took my parents?"" The bosses take control of the plane and fly it into a tunnel, where it seems to be losing power. Pops goes aft to see what's wrong with the propulsion and discovers a stowaway: Pizoni, who's heard where they're headed and doesn't want to go there, so he's destroying the engines with a crowbar.It's too late. Their momentum carries them out of the tunnel and into a jungle, where the plane crashes. Rodrigue is getting a massage and listening to music when Chimène breaks in to report the crash and suggest that he search the jungle for the wreckage; they expect April and company didn't survive.They're wrong, of course; April and Julius marvel at all the plants and the clean air and argue while Pops and Pizoni are captured almost immediately and confined in a laser-walled cell right next to Paul's. April, Darwin, and Julius find their way into the research station. They dress up in red coveralls and ask another red-suit where Annette and Paul Franklin are, but the guy realizes that anyone he doesn't know is likely to be a spy and calls for help, so they have to run. The lizard guard who shoots at them (one of Rodrigue and Chimène's many children) manages to short out the whole electrical system when he misses, putting everyone in the dark and letting Paul, Pops, and Pizoni out of their cells. Paul and Pops go looking for April, telling Pizoni he can get out through the chimney. (Apparently they're under ground. Pizoni spends the rest of the movie climbing.)Darwin distracts a lizard guard by climbing into its armor so Julius can grab its weapon. Held upside down, the guard tells them Paul is in a cell; they can follow the blue lights to find the holding area. They take off and the guard quickly reports to Rodrigue -- Papa -- that they're headed for Paul's cell and they have the guard's ray gun. Rodrigue (who is frequently advised by Chimène to quell his brutal tendencies) says ""Chimène, I just had an idea. A nonviolent one! I think you'll like it.""Paul and Pops wander the jungle looking for April while April, Julius, and Darwin, who have lost the trail of blue lights, wander aimlessly until they encounter Annette. April is overjoyed; Annette whisks them away and explains that she's working with the world's greatest minds in this ""technological paradise"" to complete ""the project."" April wants to know where her father is, why her mother isn't locked up (""You escaped, right? You were in a cell, like father? You know how to get him out?""), and whether this project has something to do with the ultimate serum. Annette is evasive until they meet Rodrigue and Chimène.April accuses her mother of betraying them; Annette denies it. April, assuming that they want the serum, gives Rodrigue the snowglobe. He smashes it, laughing, and says they want what's inside her head. Chimène and Annette explain that they've recreated the serum in the globe several times and it never worked -- Darwin was cured by April's serum. As proof, Chimène produces the spy rat that Darwin attacked just before they left April's lair in the statue: the rat, which consumed a few drops of April's serum after she broke the vial, is fine now, and can regenerate and survive any attack. Darwin gets very excited: ""I could be a warrior -- a cat ninja!"" When April asks how she could have created something like that in her makeshift lab, Rodrigue responds by shooting Darwin in the chest. The cat appears to die but quickly recovers and repeats, ""Cat ninja!"" Chimène tells April she's going to recreate her serum for the project. Just then the power comes back on and April, Julius, and Darwin realize they're on a launchpad. There's a rocket covered with vines and vegetation near the cliff wall and a crowd of red-suited scientists nearby.Chimène explains, ""You see this rocket? It's covered with specimens of plants. It will explode in deep space, scattering billions of spores cultivated in this jungle. Once you've treated them with your serum, the spores will be able to survive the explosion and the interstellar vacuum. They'll spread to new planets where they'll flourish and multiply. Thanks to you, April, life will never end.""Julius says ""Hold on -- you're going to blow up a huge bomb to save life? That's why you need all this science?""Chimène and Rodrigue believe that humanity will eventually destroy the world. The purpose of their project is to spread life widely enough that it can't be stamped out. April is angry and says all this doesn't justify stealing her parents and killing all the people on the cable car. Chimène says that was an accident and threatens to let Rodrigue ""deal with"" Annette if April doesn't cooperate. April caves and gets to work, with Julius assisting, in a lab set up right on the launchpad. They test her serum on a dead potted plant, which revives, sprouts new leaves, and blooms before their eyes. Rodrigue asks for the serum and Julius hands him a vial.Rodrigue drinks the serum himself (""So this is what it feels like to be invincible! I like it!"") and announces, over Chimène's protests, that he's lowered the altimeter setting on the bomb to 500 meters; it will destroy all life on the surface of the earth. (Presumably the lizards are safe in their cavern.) ""These humans will get the fate they deserve!"" When Chimène protests, Rodrigue attacks and overpowers her, despite Annette's attempt to help Chimène. Rodrigue demands that his children choose between living and ruling with him and dying with their mother. They start shooting.The wounded Chimène tells April the only hope is to get inside the rocket and reset the altimeter to trigger the bomb far out in space. Rodrigue is preparing to kill April when Julius shoots him with his captured ray gun. ""Idiot! I'm invincible!"" says Rodrigue, before keeling over. Julius explains that he switched the serum with a vial of water, which is what Rodrigue drank. They realize the rocket is about to take off and April, Julius, and Darwin rush to get aboard. Only Darwin is quick enough. But April is able to throw the vial of serum at the rocket, inoculating the vegetation before lift-off. Paul and Pops appear in an elevator and whisk Annette, April, and Julius away from the launchpad.Meanwhile Darwin, aboard the rocket, tries to reset the altimeter. It's not clear he succeeded until the rocket breaks through the ceiling of the cavern -- it turns out they were beneath Paris all along -- and disappears into the sky. Pizoni emerges from a chimney just in time to see it. He on his rooftop and the Franklins and Julius, who are in a car trying to get as far from the explosion as they can in case Darwin fails, see a bright, distant flash when the rocket explodes without destroying anything.A series of news reports plays out on a TV in a room that changes over time:1941: Napoleon V makes Pizoni head of his secret service.1951: ""Limitless"" oil has ended the energy wars; acclaimed biologist April Franklin has failed to make her ultimate serum compatible with the human organism; plant life is observed on the moon, Mars, and Venus.2001: A spaceship from the Democratic Union lands on the moon, which has verdant vegetation, a breathable atmosphere -- and a cat. Darwin says to the camera, ""What took you so long? April, I'm coming!"" An elderly Julius leaves the room to tell April that Darwin has been found."

She mentions her time in Mexico again and tells him she is different and free from pain now. Ben interrupts and Eden now tells Ben that grief and pain are just chemical reactions and they can be changed and expelled from their bodies. Ben tells her she sounds like a pamphlet and teases her about her new philosophy. She tries to take this in jest but when he tells her the philosophy sounds crazy, she slaps him hard across the face and exits. Ben asks Will how hes been doing, given what hes gone through. Will seems broken and somber still.Eden apologizes to Ben when they reemerge from the kitchen and offers him a drink, which he says he will never refuse.

A stranger arrives named Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch) who seems beloved by Sadie, Eden, and David. Gina complains about Choi being late; she complains about not having service up there in the hills.

He finds a bottle of pills in an unmarked bottle and pockets a few. He looks at the master bathroom and has a flashback to Eden and him in the bathtub and their young son walking in to say goodnight.In the living room, everyone is talking about how Eden, David, Sadie, and Pruitt are in a cult called The Invitation, which is why they were in Mexico. The others are lighthearted about this, teasing them. David tells them its a group that comes together to help each other in their grief that now has thousands of members all over. As they inquire more, David says he wants to show them a recruitment video. The video is hosted by a leader who tells them that the human brain has the ability to heal and he has made his life work to rewire traumatic experiences; he says they are not alone and they transcend. It then cuts to a woman in bed, surrounded by the leader and dome members as they assist her in suicide. In the living room, this scene unnerves the non-members. Eden tells them the woman was sick and she let her death be filmed to show others that its nothing to be afraid of. David tells them that he used to do cocaine to deal with his grief but he has been centered since joining The Invitation. Eden says that she is finally happy despite the grief she used to feel everyday.The doorbell rings. Pruitt and David answers the door and talks to some unseen neighbors. At the same time, Gina approaches Will and apologizes for keeping her distance over the years. She explains that she had been trying to give him space to deal with his grief. But Will is distracted by David at the front door; David tells Will that it was just some neighbors looking for a party.Will shows the pills he took from Edens bedroom to Miguel, who is a doctor. He is told that its a barbiturate which is only dangerous if you take too much of it. The group is given wine again and they all toast. Will asks Tommy and Miguel if they feel that the night is strange but Tommy tells him its just a friendly, harmless reunion.To apologize for forcing everyone to watch the video, David suggests they all play a game that he learned in The Invitation called I Want where everyone just expresses what they want. Sadie starts, saying she wants to tell everyone that she loves them, naming everyone by name. She then says a lot of people don't say they're afraid but they are and she loves them. Sadie then kisses Gina hard on the lips. Gina then says ""I want some of that coke you used to do to David"". He actually has some; she tells him she was kidding and he says she wasn't, which was the point of the game. She accepts. Pruitt says, I want to tell you about my wife, Margaret. He tells them that she died when he got in a fight with her and after he assaulted her, she fell and hit her head and died. Pruitt tells them he served jail time for the mistake but it didn't help rid him of the angry person he was. It wasn't until he joined The Invitation that he became a better person and he cant wait until the day Margaret and him can be together again.Claire is uncomfortable, feeling like they're being sold something with all the talk of The Invitation. Sadie interrupts to tell them, ""I want to kiss Ben"". Ben plays along, giving her a peck but she full-on kisses him instead. Tommy says he wants a blowjob. Claire says she feels uncomfortable and wants to leave. David tries to convince her to stay but Will tells him he should let her leave if she wants to. Claire says goodbye to everyone but Pruitt tells her he parked in front of her and will have to move his car. The two of them walk out. Will watches from the window, suspicious. Sure enough, Pruitt does move his car to let Claire out. Will is appeased at first but then Pruitt stops Claire as she is about to drive away. David interrupts as Will is watching, convincing Will to talk to him alone.David asks why Will is so suspicious of him he says Will seems distant and off, worried about David locking the door or Pruitt moving his car. Will apologizes, saying maybe he wasn't prepared to be at the home he used to live in with Eden and their son.The group has dinner and Will is mentally distracted, flashing back to a birthday party where his son is accidentally killed in some unseen way.Will goes outside in the backyard to clear his head and he tries to get a signal on his phone to find out why Choi isn't there yet. When he returns to the house, he sees Sadie looking in the mirror, making grotesque facial expressions. He goes out in the backyard again and Sadie follows behind. She begins hitting on him, telling him she suspects things aren't going well with Kira and tells him he can fuck her right there. She goes into a speech about not denying themselves of pleasure and that in Mexico, men and women would often have sex spontaneously. She tells Will he can make him like her so much, she can make him beg her without even touching him. He rejects her advances and tells her to go back inside.Tommy greets Will in the backyard. Will voices his concerns about the party but Tommy tells him Claire left because shes sexually awkward and Choi is unreliable so his absence isnt suspicious. Tommy tells Will his weird behavior is freaking people out. They hug and Tommy goes back inside. Wills phone chirps as he is able to get a signal briefly. He listens to his voicemail it is from Choi who says he has arrives at the party early and is about to go inside but forgot the dessert he promised. He asks Will to pick it up instead so he doesnt have to go back down the canyon.Will joins everyone else at the dinner table. The lights are turned out and Eden comes in with a birthday cake for Miguel, even though its a week away. When the lights are turned back on, Will asks where Choi is, telling them about the message he received when Choi was right outside. Eden and David say Choi never got there and everyone tries to assuage Will. But he chastises the others for being polite and continues demanding to know where Choi is. He asks why they were invited to a dinner after a two-year absence, with two strangers from the cult being present. He chastises The Invitation and says its a brainwashing tactic and the cult teaches them just to deny everything by erasing their grief. He begs Eden to tell him where Choi is and asks David why there are bars on the window and the doors are locked. He also points out that he found the large bottle of pills in Edens room. Kira tries to convince Will to leave with her but then the doorbell rings. It is Choi who says he had to turn around after arriving early because he got a call from work. Everyone stares at Will as if hes officially lost his mind. He apologizes, in tears, to Kira for questioning The Invitation.Will goes to the bathroom to wash his face and has a flashback to teaching his son how to wash his hands. He goes out to the backyard and is greeted by Kira. He tells her hes clearly not okay because he is still dealing with the pain of his sons death. He tells Kira he doesn't think she can help which upsets her and she goes back inside.When Will goes inside, Eden is cutting the cake. He asks if he can see their sons bedroom. Will walks around and has a flashback to his son sleeping inside. Through the window, Will sees David go into the backyard and light a red lantern perched on the edge of the backyard. Will retrieves the laptop that the recruitment video was played on. He watches more of the video from the leader who tells the members to not be scared and to remember that a reward is upon them if they take the steps and believe and give themselves over. Pruitt knocks on the door and tells Will everyone is waiting for him, while simultaneously on the video, the leader tells the watching cult member that he loves them.Will is led upstairs where everyone is poured another glass of wine. The members of The Invitation seem elated at this. David suggests they should all take a moment to look at each other and then raise their glass in a toast, to a better world and to peace. Gina drinks her glass right away. Will smashes the glasses out of everyone's hands, telling them not to drink. He tells Kira they're leaving. Sadie goes berserk, telling Will hes ruining everything. She charges at him and he pushes her away, knocking her into a dresser. Everyone surrounds her, worried that she has been killed when hitting her head (akin to Pruitts story about accidentally killing his wife). The group gathers around, trying to revive Sadie. Kira says she's not breathing and it is revealed she doesn't mean Sadie but Gina, who is foaming at the mouth. Miguel tries to revive Gina with CPR but is shot with a gun by David. Pruitt takes the gun away from David while Kira, Ben, and Will back away. Pruitt then shoots Choi dead before venturing to another part of the house. The three non-members try to escape, grabbing Tommy with them, but he is angry about the death of his boyfriend and charges at Eden, who slashes him with a knife.Kira and Will separate from Ben and are charged at by Sadie. Will shoves her away and they barricade themselves in a room but the windows are barred. They can see David in the backyard stabbing Ben and then Pruitt joining, shooting Ben dead. Will tries to calm Kira down, telling them they will survive by doing whatever it takes because they're dealing with human beings. They step back into the house where Will spies David trying to calm down Eden who is upset about all the murder taking place in exchange for the poisoning. David points out that they were chosen and this is how they can leave the Earth along with all the hurt they harbor. Will waits until both have gone and then Kira and him start upstairs to an exit that leads to the garage. Will spies Sadie dying on the couch, having impaled herself with a fireplace poker. As she slowly dies, unable to make noise, he takes the fireplace poker from her lap.Upstairs, Will learns the door to the garage has been removed over the last few years. Pruitt ventures upstairs with a gun. Will emerges, knocking it out of his hand. They scuffle. Kira attacks him with the fireplace poker until she successfully kills Pruitt. They run into Eden in the hall. She shoots Will in the shoulder. Eden then apologizes and shoots herself in the stomach. Kira grabs the gun.Now David is the only cult member alive; he is brandishing the butcher knife, calling for Eden. Will tells David that Eden shot herself and David is glad, because shes with them now. Kira realizes that the gun is empty. Will warns David not to approach because they have a gun but David isnt worried about his own death because its time. Hes stopped short by Tommy who has survived the stabbing. Tommy wrestles David to the ground, stabbing him in the stomach.Nearby, Eden has not yet died. Crying, she tells Will that she also misses their son. She asks Will to take her outside to die. He does and Will, Kira, and Tommy watch as Eden takes her last breaths. The sounds of sirens are heard in the distance, as well as dogs barking, faint screaming, and helicopters churning overhead. As Tommy goes inside to retrieve the corpse of his boyfriend, Kira and Will venture to the side of the hill and notice the hillside filled with light from red lanterns. Theirs was not an isolated incident; thousands of cult members were also carrying out the same plan that night."

'Slow West' follows a 16-year-old boy on a journey across 19th Century frontier America in search of the woman he loves, while accompanied by mysterious traveler Silas.—Anonomous Set at the end of the 19th century, Slow West follows Jay, a 17-year-old Scottish aristocrat who travels to American West to look for his former lover. Faced with the brutal frontier environment, he soon teams up with a rough and mysterious traveller named Silas, who soon discovers that Jay's old flame has a price on her head. Together, they make their way through the wilderness, while trying to stay one step ahead of the bounty hunters. Jay Cavendish (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young man from Scotland traveling through the United States in search of his love, Rose Ross (Caren Pistorius). On his journey, he comes by the woods near a Native American camp where a group of union officers are chasing after a Native American. Two run off and chase the man, and gunshots are heard. A bandit named Silas Selleck (Michael Fassbender) shows up with a gun aimed at the one officer. Jay holds his gun up to Silas, but Silas still shoots the officer. He and Jay then join forces and travel together.Through some flashbacks, we see Jay and Rose spending time together back in Scotland, rolling down a hill near a beach. He was very much in love with her, while she only saw him as a brother, something that troubled him.Jay and Silas ride through a field where three Congolese men are playing a song about love. Jay tells one of the men that he likes the song, and he notes that ""love is universal like death"". Following closeby are a group of bounty hunters, led by Payne (Ben Mendelsohn). The two ride by a shop where Silas sees a wanted poster for both Rose and her father John (Rory McCann), offering a $2,000 reward if they're caught dead. Everybody but Jay knows about it. The two enter the shop to gather some items. After them enters a Swedish couple, Johan and Maria (Karl Willetts and Brooke Williams). Johan raises his gun to the shopkeeper, demanding money even though the shopkeeper insists that this shop would be the only place he could spend money. The shopkeeper shoots Johan in the chest, and Maria shoots the shopkeeper dead. She aims at Silas, also demanding money. Jay shoots her in the back. He and Silas leave with their items until they see two children, Eva and Jan (Evie and George Simon).

He stays there for hours as John has company over. Jay's uncle Rupert (Alex MacQueen) shows up and tries taking Jay back, dismissing everyone in the house as peasants. Jay says he is with Rose now. Rupert slaps Rose, prompting John to retaliate by shoving Rupert backwards and causing him to smash his head against a rock, killing him. This leads to John and Rose becoming outlaws.Shortly after the incident, Jay makes it to the U.S. and encounters a clergyman named Angus (Tony Croft). He says he is documenting the downfall of the Aboriginal tribe and hoping to spread Christianity. Jay asks Angus for advice. The next morning, Jay wakes up alone to nothing but an egg resting on a note that says ""West"".

Silas shaves Jay's face with his knife while Jay tells Silas that he is a lonely man. Payne walks out from behind a tree with a bottle and some glasses. He joins the two at their camp site, and he asks Jay knowingly if he is traveling to find his sweetheart.

Silas tries to get him to stop his pursuit of Rose, but Jay insists that she is his. They fall asleep and wake up to the pouring rain, almost submerging them and their items.

They have a Native American helper, Kotori (Kalani Queypo).

The Wave,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3616916/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Although anticipated, no one is really ready when the mountain pass above the scenic, narrow Norwegian fjord Geiranger collapses and creates an 85-meter high violent tsunami. A geologist is one of those caught in the middle of it. Based on the fact that mountain pass Åkneset, located in the Geiranger fjord in Norway, will one day collapse and create a violent tsunami of over 80 meters that will crush everything in its path before it hits land in Greenland. A geologist gets caught in the middle of it and a race against time begins.—Fredrik Rønningen Geologist Kristian Eikjord works controlling the movements of mountains and fjords in Geiranger. He says goodbye to his colleagues since he is moving with his family to Stavanger to work in the oil industry. Leaving the station, he is intrigued to note that two sensors indicate a strange movement of the underground water. While waiting for the ferry to Stavanger with his teenage son Sondre and little daughter Julia, Kristian decides to return to the station. He goes by helicopter with his colleague Jacob to investigate the sensors and they find the wires broken. When Jacob and his boss Arvid head to the place later to a further investigation, they discover that an avalanche will happen soon. Arvid orders for to sound the warning alarm in Geiranger. When Kristian and Julia hear the alarm, he calls his wife Idun who works in the local hotel and warns that she and Sondre should go to a higher place since a tsunami will come in a few minutes in Geiranger. What will the population do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film opens with footage of a real life disaster that occurred on January 15, 1905 in Norway. A rock slide occurred near Lodalen in Nordfjord that happened while the nearby town was asleep. The resulting tsunami killed 63 people. The wave was 40 meters high when it hit land. A similar accident years later causes the death of 40 people. Norway has over 300 registered unstable mountainsides. Narration notes it is only a matter of time before the next big rock slide happens.A Norwegian mountain based town, Geiranger, is now threatened by the same problem. Its unstable mountainside, the Akernes, will eventually send seven million cubic meters of rock down, which will crash into the water, causing a massive tsunami wave.A geologist, Kristian (Kristoffer Joner) drives in his car, eventually driving it on a large ferry boat that will take him over the water into town. He arrives home and greets his wife and children. His wife Idun (Ane Dahl Torp) is struggling to fix a leaky pipe and asks for a plumbers wrench. Kristian however gives her the wrong one, so his teenage son Sondre (Jonas Hoff Oftebro) finds the right one so she can fix the problem. Kristian shakes his head and says their new home wont have problems like that, giving her a kiss. Idun notes that their home they have now has soul. ""Whats soul?"" Julia (Edith Haagenrud-Sande), their eight-year-old daughter, asks. ""Soul is some nonsense your mother believes in"", Kristian playfully replies.During dinner, Kristian hypes up their new apartment, noting the various technological perks including being able to lock and unlock their door using a phone app.After dinner, Idun continues to pack up the kitchen. Kristian comes in and asks if he should get rid of some old shirts. Idun asks why and Kristian notes that he is getting a new job, a new home, a new life etc. Kristian then says hell forget moving and they'll stay in town but Idun vetoes that, saying they decided to go. Idun then playfully says he should get a new suit, and should wear only those. Also, he should get a haircut and be more presentable. Maybe Ill get more attention than that mountain, she notes playfully. Kristian then asks if she wants attention and takes her in his arms, plopping her on the kitchen counter. As they are about to fool around like teenagers, Sondre walks by and becomes disgusted. ""Hey, not on the kitchen counter! We have to make food on that!"" he exclaims which causes his parents to erupt into laughter.The next day, Kristian heads into what will be one of his last days of work at the Early Warning Center which is 102.1 meters above sea level. He goes into the control and asks how the numbers are. The tech says they are within acceptable parameters.Kristian has cake with his co-workers, who want to say goodbye to him and congratulate on his new job in the oil industry. They also playfully rib his need to triple check data to the point of paranoia.Kristian begins to clean out his office. As he does so, he hears beeping from the control room. He ignores it for a moment but when the beeping continues, he goes to investigate. He sees his team looking at the numbers which has spiked drastically in the past couple hours. Ground water levels have shrunk several feet. They look at camera footage, but everything looks stable. Kristian's face gets scared as he maps out worst case scenarios. However, one of his co-workers snaps him out of his trance, telling him everything is fine and that he can go back to packing up his office.Kristian is at home, looking at the numbers, concerned as his wife and daughter pack up the house. Julia comes in and is happy she got all her stuffed animals into one box. Sondre asks if a few of the boxes are ready to be moved and if his father will be helping. Idun says he will. Talking to her, Kristian says something weird happened with the groundwater levels during the day. However, Idun brushes his concerns off saying his job is done, and the mountain will be around for a thousand years. She tells him to help with the packing so the moving truck can be ready to go the following morning.Kristian goes outside to throw some old papers in the dumpster. Near the water, he sees his son, listening to music sadly. He walks up to him and asks how Sondre is doing. Sondre confesses he doesn't want to move. He likes his home for its beauty and safety. Kristian comforts him but notes his mother and him made the tough choice for the family's sake. Sondre asks what happens after a few years in Stavanger, will they just move again? Sondre walks away, despondent, while Kristian sits and ponders how his career change affects his children.As they finishing up packing, Kristian and his family are greeted by their neighbors who talk about the move. Idun mentions that Kristian and the kids will be going ahead of her while she still has to work for a few more days. Kristian looks up at the mountains foreboding. He just cant shake the feeling that something is deeply wrong.Kristian drives with the kids to the ferry meeting point. He looks at the mountain again. He sees Sondre play a Jenga game on his phone and the pieces toppling down. Looking at some nearby rocks, he notices a bunch of water dripping through them. A bunch of cars honk behind as it is time to dock the cars on the boat. When Julia asks if he is going to drive, Kristian quickly turns the car around and goes back to his office. He walks in and tells his colleagues he has to show them something, his voice grave.Meanwhile, Idun is on a bike, on her way to work. She works at the Hotel Geiranger, which is only 1.7 meters above sea level. She is greeted by her friend and co-worker Vibeke (Eili Harboe) who gently chides her for being late. As they begin to check in a bus load of newly arrived guests, Vibeke asks about Idun's family. Idun says they are already on the ferry.Kristian briefs the team, saying he believes now that the sensors may have been severed due to the shifting of the rock layers. If that is true, and the seemingly disappeared groundwater is shifting between the rock layers, they could eventually collapse, which will make it impossible to give warning to the town. Though the team is somewhat skeptical, the idea of being wrong is too much to fathom so they immediately head out via a chopper to investigate the sensors.Landing on the Eagles Nest Control Station, a base set in the mountains, 874.1 meters above sea level, near where they have set up their sensors, Kristian and one of his colleagues get out with gear. They suit up with climbing gear.Back at the hotel, Idun gets a call from Sondre, learning they are still in town. Idun asks where they are.Back at the mountain, Kristian and his teammate clip onto the safety rope and proceed to rappel down the mountain crevice where their equipment is set up. They turn on helmet cameras so the rest of the team can see what they see. They begin to travel through the narrow area, with Kristian checking sensor four while the other man checks sensor five. They begin to pull out long strands of wiring, only for the other man to show that his wires have been severed. Kristian pulls out his and realizes his too have been cut.Back at the office, Kristian notes that wires were not cut naturally but by movements in the rocks. One of his colleagues says they will look into it by conducting more tests and drilling more holes. Kristian balks at that, asking if the man heard anything he has told them. He shows them a simulation of what will happen if the mountainside falls. An 80 meter wave will decimate the entire town within ten minutes time. The colleague asks if Kristian wants to start a panic and ruin the tourist season.Kristian asks if they are not going to alert the town, what is to be done. The co-worker, Arvid (Fridtjov Saheim) compromises, saying they will go on Yellow Alert, which will entail longer shifts for the crews, and the round the clock surveillance of the mountain. Avrid notes all they found were some cut wires but otherwise have no other evidence that something is wrong with the mountain. Kristian apologizes for being so quick to start a panic, and seems convinced that they will take care of it. As he goes back to the car, he notices his kids are gone. They left a note saying they were tired of waiting and to call their mother.Kristian arrives at the hotel. He curses himself, realizing Idun will kill him for this. He finds his kids in the lobby while Idun is at the desk, glaring at him with daggers in her eyes. She quietly berates him, saying he cant go work for hours and leave their children in the car, especially since he doesn't work there anymore. Kristian apologizes, saying he got a real bad feeling. Idun sighs and says they will try to leave town the next day. She says she will set the kids up in a room for the night, but Julia wants to sleep in their home and say goodbye to the house. Sondre elects to stay at the hotel with his mother, giving Vibeke a flirtatious glance. So Julia heads home with her father, while Idun stays at work with Sondre.In the car, Julia asks her dad if mom and he are getting divorced. Kristian chuckles and says no. He tells Julia that he and Idun had a small fight and they will get over it, he hopes. ""Thats life"", Julia notes. ""That's life! Kristian concurs, chuckling.Back at the hotel, Idun shows her son his room. She warns him not to take alcohol from the mini bar and not look at the porn channels to his embarrassment.Back at the house, Kristian finds an old mattress for Julia to sleep on and a chair for himself to sleep in. Later that night, he tucks her in. Kristian notes they didn't need a hotel. ""This place has more soul"", Julia says. ""Yeah"", Kristian replies agreeing, ""It actually does.""Kristian goes into the kitchen and has a drink with a bottle of liquor given to him by his colleagues. He sits in his chair and watches his daughter sleep.At the hotel, Idun gets a text from her husband apologizing for his actions. She smiles slightly, ready to forgive. Thinking about his fears, she pulls out a folder at her desk, which details evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami wave and flips through them, noting a particular route in the hotel.Back at the Eagles Nest, two of his colleagues are on shift, keeping tabs. Jacob (Arthur Berning) asks Arvid about Kristian, asking if he thinks Kristian will stay with the oil industry long. Arvid says Kristian will be back within a year as the mountains become an obsession for men like them.As night falls, the town is quiet, especially at the hotel. Sondre is in his room, flipping channels. Bored, he grabs his skateboard and leaves, seeing Vibeke on the way out, saying hello. They trade glances at each other and smile. Walking down some stairs, Sondre finds a door that leads a basement level. He turns on his music and skates around the hallways.Back at the base, one of Kristian's colleagues, Georg (Herman Bernhoft) is watching the horror movie 'Cold Prey' on his laptop. In the background, the computer starts to beep, showing a shift in numbers. Georg doesn't notice it until he accidentally knocks over a glass of milk. Noticing the numbers, he panics and wakes up Margot (Laila Goody).Back at his house, Kristian wakes up after dozing off.At the Eagles Nest, Arvid is awakened by the radio. Margot and Georg tell him that sensors say that the crevice has contracted. Arvid thinks that is impossible and tells them to re-calibrate the system and take another reading. He tells Margot he and Jacob will go down and check it out personally.Kristian goes out to his porch and looks out to the mountain in the distance.Jacob and Avrid rappel down into the crevice and take a look. Jacob gets a call from Kristian and he asks if everything is okay. He learns about the crevice contracting and he learns Jacob and Arvid are checking it out. Margot says they will keep him posted. Kristian says okay but as he hangs up, he can only think of the worst.Back in the crevice, the two are moving along when some rocks fall on them.Back at the basic, seismic activity is being recording and other readings are beeping like crazy.Kristian sees a large bird migration in the sky. Now he knows something is wrong and pulls his papers out of the garbage in a panic, spilling them out on the kitchen floor.Jacob and Arvid check the sensors and confirm the contraction numbers. Jacob goes to check on a seventh sensor but unlatches himself from the safety harness.Kristian reads the paperwork and realizes that an avalanche is going to occur. Kristian calls the base and they patch him into Arvid who tells him to get the hell out immediately. As Arvid and Jacob goes to leave, a bunch of rocks fall. A large stone catches Jacobs leg, trapping him. Arvid goes to free him as the groundwater levels go down to dangerous levels. As Arvid tries to reach Jacob, the crevice begins to crush inward. The other sensors go to code red. Kristian tells her to sound the alarm but she hesitates. Arvid then tells her to go to Red Alert and sound the alarm. Margot presses the button.The alarm system reverberates through the entire town. Idun hears it and goes outside.The rock slide inside the crevice stops and Arvid can finally meet Jacob. Arvid hears a sound and calmly clips his line to Jacob. When Jacob asks what he is doing, Arvid replies, ""It won't hold both of us.""The rock slide begins in earnest and the ensuing rocks knock Arvid off the ledge to his death (he sacrificed himself for Jacob). Jacob screams his name in horror. The avalanche of rocks begins to hit the water, causing a massive wave to form.Back at the base, a countdown begins on the computer screen. The town of Geiranger has just ten minutes before the wave will hit them. Kristian loses the call with Margot and his daughter wakes up. As tremor hit the house, Kristian hugs her tight and puts a ten minute countdown on his watch. At the hotel, Idun is met by Vibeke. Idun realizes that her husband was right and tells Vibeke they have ten minutes. She then tells her to warn every guest they have to leave NOW and to find the bus driver.Kristian and Julia race out of the house and into their car and drive off. He calls Idun but she doesn't have her phone.Idun knocks on every door to warn the guests. She calls Kristian and asks if Julia is okay. Kristian sees a family packing the car as he drives by. He quickly opens the car door, tells them they don't have time to pack and to leave immediately. Other families are shown quickly driving out of the town. As he continues to drive, he tells Idun they can make it to the hotel, but Idun vetoes his plan, telling his concern is getting their daughter to safety. Kristian asks if she and Sondre will be okay and she says yes. As he sits at a crossroad hesitating, Idun tells him to get to higher ground. Realizing he has no choice, he makes the turn that will take up the mountain road to higher ground.The wave continues to make its way to the town, destroying everything in its path.Idun meets Vibeke in the lobby, where a group of guests, including the driver are arguing with them over their luggage. Idun shuts them all up, explaining that if they don't get above 80 meters sea level in the next ten minutes, a mega-tsunami wave will kill them all. This convinces everyone who rushes to the bus. However, Idun realizes her son is missing and races to find him.Back on the road, Kristian and Julia are caught in a major traffic jam. He checks his watches and sees they only have four and half minutes before the wave hits, yet they are only 47 meters above sea level. If they don't cover some serious ground soon, they will all die. He pulls Julia out of the car and tells her to run. As he passes every car, he tells the passengers to get out and run to higher ground. Everyone believes him and soon a large group is running up the hill to safety.At the hotel, Idun goes to Sondre's room to find it empty. She calls his phone, but he doesn't pick up. She races back to the lobby where Vibeke is loading passengers on to the bus. Idun asks Vibeke about her son and Vibeke says she saw Sondre in the hallway earlier. Idun races back in unwilling to leave without her son. A woman, Maria (Mette Agnette Horn) part of a couple Idun was nice to earlier, leaves the bus to help her, her husband Phillip (Thomas Bo Larsen) reluctantly following. Vibeke screams that they won't make it.Back on the hill, Kristian checks his watch, seeing they are only 57 meters up. He sees his neighbor Thomas and his family, telling them to get out of the car. However, another man exits his vehicle and it reverses, trapping Thomas wife Anna's leg. Kristian looks back and sees the wave is not far behind. Kristian tells Thomas to get their daughters to safety. Kristian gets in the car that trapped Anna and moves it, freeing her. However, the crushing has given her a terrible limp. As Kristian tries to move her, he realizes they won't make it to a safe distance in time. He quickly puts her in a car, and gets in the passenger side. He tells her to buckle up and hold on tight. With the wave seconds away, he and Anna hold hands tightly as the wave hits. The water crashes through the back window submerging them as they see and feel cars and other debris tumble around them. As they look through the windshield they scream underwater as a large piece of debris hits the windshield.Back at the hotel, Idun and the couple call out for Sondre. Maria hears a noise, and notices the basement door. Idun races down and finds Sondre. As they races back to the lobby, they see the bus was forced to leave without them. Idun sees the massive wave about to crash into the town and screams there is a bomb shelter in the hotel (from the plan she noticed earlier) and pushes her son and the couple back inside. Maria freezes in shock with Idun having to break her out of it. They run in just as the wave hits the hotel, water following them quickly behind. Phillip and Sondre find the bomb shelter and open the door waiting for Idun and Maria. However, Marias hesitation has cost them precious seconds, as the water comes in right behind them and sweeps them off their feet. Idun manages to catch the door but Maria is sadly swept away in the water down the hallway. Phillip calls for his wife but Idun tells him sadly that shes gone and if he doesn't shut the bomb shelter door, they will all die. Idun and Sondre force the door close and find themselves in a half submerged room. The light inside sparks out and they are left in darkness.Back on the hill, Kristian wakes up in the car upside down. He looks to Anna only to see she is not responsive. He puts his fingers to her neck and doesn't find a pulse. He realizes she is dead and there is nothing he can do. Kristian unlatches his seat belt and escapes the wreck, crawling out of the car. He takes a long look around, taking in the large swath of destruction. He calls out his daughters name and proceeds to climb the hill.Back at the geology base, we see the computer simulation timer has reached zero, as Margot and Georg continue to monitor the reading. The radio cackles to life. It is Jacob. Margot asks if he is okay. Jacob breaks down in tears. Margot asks if Arvid is okay. Jacobs lack of response makes Margot realizes Arvid is dead and she cries.Kristian makes it up the hill and sees some people made it to safety. He calls out to Julia and she runs to him and embraces him. Kristian sees Thomas, and Thomas, seeing Kristian alone realizes his wife didn't make it, causing him to break down.Back in the bomb shelter, Idun finds an emergency flashlight, and goes over to Phillip to comfort him.On the hill, Kristian overhears a man talking to some people in cabins over the mountainside. He talks to the person on the line and asks if a tourist bus made it into the area. He finds out that one did not. Kristian fears the worst, thinking his family was on the bus. However, he wants to be sure, and will go down into town to investigate. He tells Julia he needs to find Mom and Sondre and let them know they are okay. He tells her to stay with Thomas and comfort Tessa, telling her she is so brave. Kristian then heads back down the road into town.In the bomb shelter, Idun finds a fuse box, turning on emergency power. Idun and Sondre try to open the door but the hotel is still fully flooded so only water seeps in. They have no choice but to keep it closed. With other water dripping in, Idun knows they cannot stay in the room forever. Finding a vent, she smashes the grate off then goes up to take a look. The venting is very narrow, most likely too narrow for them to travel through. She screams in frustration. Idun hears metal creak and looks at the door. Water begins to come in through the door cracks so she and Phillip use their coats to slow down the water. Phillip becomes more unstable saying they should take their chances because if they stay in the room, they will die. Idun cautions against hasty moves, noting when the water is above the door, they will try to open it again, hoping the pressure will be much lower.Kristian rows into town on a boat, with a piece of wood as an oar. He looks around and sees the complete destruction of his town and a dead man floating in the water. After awhile, he must travel by foot, seeing the destruction and death up close. He calls out, hoping to find survivors but hears nothing. He continues to walk until he feels the ground feel unstable. He wipes away mud to find a glass window. He then realizes it is the tour bus. He takes a look inside and begins to check for survivors. He finds the driver, among many others, dead. He checks all the bodies but doesn't find his wife and son. He does however find Vibeke dead. In the end, he realizes no one on the bus survived but his wife and son weren't on it. He sees the destroyed hotel in the distance.We see outside the bomb shelter door. The entire hallway and above is submerged in water. Inside, the room is almost full. Idun decides to try the door again. The three of them work to unlatch the door, struggling. However, a bunch of rock debris now blocks the door, making it almost impossible to open. They go over to the vent so they can continue to breathe. Phillip begins to panic, dragging Idun and Sondre under the water, yelling he wont die like this. Phillip continues to dunk them both, and in fear for the life of her son, Idun drags Phillip under water and proceeds to lock his head between her legs, trapping him. As she is forced to drown Phillip, Idun tells her son not to look. Phillip drowns moments later.Kristian gets into the lobby of the hotel and calls out for anyone, getting no response. He checks the hallway and calls out for Idun and Sondre. Part of the roof collapses, scaring him. Kristian finds the basement level, completely flooded and then goes upstairs to check.Back in the vent, Idun apologizes to Sondre for making him have to see what she did. She tells him to hang on.Meanwhile, after not finding his family in the hallways, finds Sondre's bag in one of the rooms. He believes his wife and son have been killed and cries. He grabs a metal pipe and begins banging on the wall in anger, sorrow, and frustration. Idun hears the clangs so she and Sondre begin to make noises of their own, hoping someone will hear. Idun goes into the water and finds a wrench and begins clanging on the pipes. Kristian hears this and realizes someone is alive. They begin to make noise back and forth and Kristian races out. However, in the shelter, water begins to fill the vent, giving Idun and Sondre very little time.Kristian takes several deep breaths and goes underwater. He sees the debris and goes to move it out of the way. Idun goes for the door again and tries to move it as Kristian moves the rocks. Idun opens the door and sees her husband. They embrace, and Kristian communicates her to move to safety while he gets their son. Idun escapes the water and back up the staircase.Kristian gets into the vent where Sondre is and embraces him. Kristian they have to take one last swim but Sondre is panicking (especially after what happened with Phillip). Kristian calms his son, saying they have no choice, and that he, his mother, and his sister need him. They go under water with Kristian leading first. As they move, Sondre sees Phillips body. As they enter the hallway, the water shifts, and Sondre panics, and begins to drown. Kristian goes back to his son, calms him, and breathes air into his mouth, telling him to go. Sondre continues to swim, reaching the staircase. As Kristian tries to swim too, he has the same problem and runs out of air and begins to drown.Sondre meets his mother and tells her Kristian is still underwater. She goes back under and grabs her husband and pulls him out. Idun begins CPR and becomes more frantic as it seems to have no effect. After a few minutes she stops, believing her husband is dead. Sondre however refuses to accept it and continues, screaming at his dad to wake up. Finally, Kristian spits up water, and comes to, embracing his family.Back on the hill, Julia and Tessa play with her bunny, trying to give her comfort. A helicopter arrives, with a survivor. Julia is crushed, thinking her family is gone. As the helicopter leaves though, we see that Kristian, Sondre, and Idun are walking up the hill. Julia happily races up to her mother and who takes Julia in her arms. The family walks toward the group of survivors and emergency res-ponders, grateful to be alive.Title credits at the end state the Akernes crevice is continuously monitored. It is still expanding by up to 15 centimeters annually. All experts agree there will be a rock slide. However, they do not know when."

During his confinement, he recalls the events leading up to his plot and his reasons for deciding to take such drastic action. The breath-taking story of a man who nearly would have changed the world. 1939, when Hitler convinced millions of people at the height of his power, one said a radical No: Georg Elser, disparaged as an assassin, is one of the greatest resistance fighters.—Andrei Georg Elser was a man who could have changed world history and saved millions of human lives, if only he had had 13 more minutes. With 13 more minutes, the bomb he had personally assembled would have torn apart Adolf Hitler and his henchmen. But this was not to be, and on 8 November 1939, Hitler left the scene of the attempted assassination earlier than expected - leaving Elser to fail catastrophically. Who was this man who recognized the danger emanating from Hitler sooner than many others, who took action when everybody else, including the German generals, meekly followed orders or kept silent? What did he see, which our parents or grandparents did not see or want to see? The man who told his torturers to their faces that he wanted to prevent the bloodshed of the imminent world war? 13 MINUTES relates the background of the failed attack in the Bürgerbräukeller and paints a suspenseful, emotional portrait of the resistance fighter who was called ""Georgie"" in his hometown. A story that takes us from his early years in the Swabian Alps - when National Socialism arrived in his hometown - to his last days at the Dachau concentration camp, where he was killed shortly before the end of the war, at the command of the one man whom he himself had wanted to kill, Adolf Hitler.—StudioCanal Georg Elser, a master carpenter in Konstanz from the Swabian town Königsbronn, is frustrated because of his home town fiance's constant abuse by his lush father Ludwig and despises the brutish Nazi regime. On 8 November 1939 he flees from the Münich Bürgerbräukeller, which was evacuated 13 minutes before the home-made bomb he managed to plant there near the podium Hitler was to speech on, only to be arrested at the Swiss Lake Konstanz border with suspicious contraband -map and detonator- and hear it only killed eight spectators. Arthur Nebe, chef of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt police, can barely curb Gestapo chef Heinrich Müller's zeal to question the sole suspect violently, for days demanding his accomplices, but he practically manages to prove he needed none, yet threatening his loved ones yields a confession and conviction. In concentration camps Sachsenhausen and Dachau, Georg Elser awaits his fate until 9 April 1945.—KGF Vissers"

A nuclear apocalypse survivor Ann Burden seeks out an agrarian life on her family's valley farmstead, sheltered from radioactive contaminants by rocky hillsides, favorable weather patterns, and an abundant ground-fed water supply. One day Ann encounters fellow survivor John Loomis, a highly skilled engineer, who, aided by medicines and a radiation suit, has traveled from a distant military bunker to the safe confines of Burden's valley. Loomis bathes in contaminated water, and immediately sickens, but is nursed back to health by Ann, who welcomes him into her farmhouse.Loomis regains his strength and gradually becomes part of Ann's humble rustic life. He helps Ann to pump gasoline from local petroleum pumps and gets the farm's long-disused tractor running, hoping to stockpile food for the winter. Ann tells Loomis about her parents and younger brother who left the valley to find other survivors but never returned. Loomis speculates that hydroelectric power might be generated from the nearby waterfall, using a water-wheel fashioned from the Burden church's planks and beams. Ann is uncomfortable with this proposal, citing her father's past involvement as preacher and her own deeply-held Christian beliefs. Loomis chooses not to pursue the project further.Ann and Loomis grow closer, cultivating crops and preparing for long-term habitation. Their domestic accord is marred by occasional tensions, notably involving matters of religion and Loomis' drinking. The two come to the verge of initiating a sexual relationship, but Loomis demurs, stating that further intimacy will change things between them, and that more time is needed.Mysterious phenomena (including stolen food supplies and a half-glimpsed shadowy figure) culminate in the arrival of a third survivor, Caleb. Though Ann welcomes Caleb into the farmhouse, friction develops between Caleb and Loomis. Loomis questions Caleb's backstory and motives; Caleb repeatedly emphasizes the religious connection he shares with Ann (in stark contrast to Loomis), and suggests a light-hearted wager for the farm-girl's affections while the two men go out turkey hunting.The three survivors slowly settle into a marginally-stable partnership. Both men relate post-apocalyptic horrors they witnessed before reaching the valley; Loomis describes a radiation-sickened youth who begged him for death, later privately confiding his belief that the dying boy was Ann's long-absent brother. Caleb pressures Ann to go forward with the water-wheel project, and work commences on tearing down the church for materials. Perceiving their mutual attraction, Loomis awkwardly gives Ann consent to pursue a romantic relationship with Caleb by making a subtle racist remark. Shortly thereafter, following a celebratory dinner, a heavily-intoxicated Loomis tells Ann he loves her before passing out in his bed. Ann joins Caleb in the adjoining bathroom, where the two engage in sexual activity.Further tensions arise between Caleb and Loomis following the sexual encounter. The two men finish the water-wheel, moving it and its wooden flume into place atop the waterfall.

L'attesa,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715122/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mother unexpectedly meets her son's fiancée at a villa in Sicily and gets to know her as she waits for her son to arrive. The play is set in Sicily in the year 2005. Few days after the sudden loss of her young son, Giuseppe, Anna receives a phone call from Jeanne, his girlfriend from Paris. Jeanne asks whether Giuseppe is home, thus showing she does not know he died; she announces her arrival in Sicily, where she was supposed to spend her Easter holiday with him. Anna just replies that Giuseppe is not home and that Pietro, the house factotum, will go to the airport to pick her up. Jeanne finally arrives in the night to the countryside villa on Mt. Etna of Giuseppe, where Anna still lives.
After having avoided meeting Jeanne for a while, Anna finally gets to know her on the following day. In order to justify both the absence of Giuseppe and the mourning atmosphere of the house, where many relatives and friends dressed in black have showed up to pay a visit, Anna makes up that her brother died shortly ago. Jeanne is sorry for having come on such a tragic moment and proposes to leave back to Paris immediately. Anna, however, invites her to remain in the estate: she is not able to tell her the truth and to let the last 'living part' of her son go. Furthermore, she seems willing to know more about Jeanne and Giuseppe, given that her son was very taciturn:in fact, the only things Anna knows about the young girl are the personal messages she has left on Giuseppe's answering machine after his death. The two women, then, start 'waiting for Giuseppe's return', which is 'expected' on Easter's eve. Thus, they start know one another better, walking in the countryside, having sauna together and visiting the ancient Roman mosaics in Piazza Armerina.
While bathing in the lake close to the estate (the theme of the lake, is recurrent in Jeanne's dreams), Jeanne meets two young men, which she invites to the villa for dinner. Anna, Jeanne (who wears Giuseppe's favourite dress) and the two men appear to have a pleasant time, but the dinner is interrupted by the factotum Pietro. Anna joins him in a separate room, where he - not approving Anna's lie and her use of Giuseppe's phone - incites her to disclose the truth to the French girl. The woman, however, prefers to postpone this moment and gives him some days of holiday; before going away, however, Pietro secretly leaves Giuseppe's phone in Jeanne's bedroom. When Anna comes back to the dining room, she finds Jeanne dancing with one of the guest on the notes of Leonard Cohen's ""Waiting for the miracle"". Anna looks upset and leaves; Jeanne, however, was flirting neither with the dancing guest (who, in fact, had proclaimed himself homosexual during the dinner) nor with the other one, whom she refuses to kiss.
The following day is finally Easter's eve. Anna finally tells Jeanne a partial truth: Giuseppe is not going to come back and see her, because he wants to leave her. As a matter of fact, Anna just made up this lie with the few things she had learned on her son's relation: she knew he was jealous, that he had been angry at Jeanne because she had had a sort of flirt with someone else on the previous summer (information Anna got from the messages Jeanne left on Giuseppe's answering machine) and that their relation was undergoing a bad period. Anna tries to comfort Jeanne, ambiguously telling her that she has to let him go forever and that she will start a new life. Jeanne announces that she will leave on the subsequent day.
In the night, Anna has a vision that Giuseppe has come home: she talks to him and she imagines joins with him the typical Easter procession of the town; when the statue of mourning Mother Mary (a sculpture which Jeanne had partially seen on her arrival) is unveiled, however, Anna regains consciousness that Giuseppe is gone. Meanwhile, at home, Jeanne finally notices Giuseppe's phone in her room and understands from Anna's personal messages on the answering machine that he is dead.
In the morning, Anna enters Jeanne's bedroom to say farewell. Ambiguously, she finally seems to tell her that Giuseppe is dead ('This house will be empty after you leave'), but in turn Jeanne remains silent, not revealing she really knows the truth. The two women hug each other tight, and Jeanne finally leaves."

Around the same time that his mother left their family (with Oscar firmly taking his dad's side), Oscar witnessed a gay hate crime at school that left the victim bloodied and permanently paralyzed. Ten years pass. Oscar, befriended by his talking hamster Buffy, wants to get into a special effects make-up school (using his friend Gemma as a model), and has come to realize his spiteful father's anti-social, immature short-comings. When Oscar meets co-worker Wilder at the hardware store, sexual feelings begin to stir but accompanied by severe stomach pains (the memory of the hate crime). A farewell costume party for Wilder brings Oscar's issues to a head, expressed sometimes in surreal terms.—statmanjeff In St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Oscar Madly has just graduated from high school. He has solely applied for a special makeup effects program in New York City for the fall, and is planning on sharing an apartment with his friend, Gemma, an aspiring actress who allows Oscar to be his makeup canvass. Gemma secretly, or not so secretly, likes Oscar as boyfriend material, despite knowing that he is probably gay, something he hasn't admitted to anyone, let alone himself. Many things have shaped not only Oscar's life, but most specifically his sexual life, top of the list being his parents' split ten years ago, his mother, Brin, who left with Oscar being collateral damage, being primarily raised by his adolescently-minded father Peter, that adolescent mindset most specifically in how he deals with Brin, Peter being homophobic himself, and Oscar, without telling anyone, having witnessed a severe gay bashing when he was nine. Within this situation, Oscar has only one true confidante in his life, his pet hamster Buffy who was a gift from his parents to lessen the blow when they split. Oscar may be able to admit to himself that he is gay when he is immediately attracted to Wilder, a colleague at the big box hardware store Oscar is working at for the summer, but he may not be able to act upon his feelings either for Wilder or any other male in his internalized homophobia stemming primarily from the specifics of that gay bashing. The question then becomes how Oscar will emerge into adulthood with this baggage he is carrying, much which only Buffy knows.—Huggo"

Equals,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3289728/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In an emotionless utopia, two people fall in love when they regain their feelings from a mysterious disease, causing tensions between them and their society. A futuristic love story set in a world where emotions have been eradicated.—Nathan Parker After a cataclysmic war sometime in the past, the survivors and their heirs have rebuilt themselves into what appears on the surface to be an idyllic, emotion-free utopia, designed to control the violent impulses which nearly destroyed them...no one exhibits individuality, everyone is equal and serves the collective good, and romantic couples, sex, and love itself no longer exist - procreation is now an in-office procedure selectively performed by purely artificial means. But there is trouble in paradise: suicides are happening at an alarming rate, and increasingly, citizens are being diagnosed with the ""incurable"" sickness of emotionality.—Mike Ferguson An advanced society - the Collective - has emerged out of a Great War. Along with the technological advances are societal advances where emotions and feelings are switched off at birth to allow humans, devoid of any individuality, to focus on the greater good of society, especially in exploring the universe. Some humans can be afflicted with Switched-on-Syndrome (SOS) - thought not to be contagious - where those emotions and feelings begin to emerge, the ultimate manifestation of the disease being coupling. There are four distinct documented stages of SOS, and if one is able to survive stage 3 when thoughts of suicide emerge, one is ultimately subjected to a painless death in the worst cases of stage 4 as there is no known cure. Humans are to report signs in other of SOS and more importantly to recognize signs of it in oneself, in both cases the affected subjects sent to Health and Safety (H and S) for ultimate diagnosis and treatment. Silas, who has one of the more coveted jobs in the Collective as an illustrator at the educational research firm Atmos, begins to recognize the symptoms in himself, and at H and S, is diagnosed at stage 1 of SOS. In treatment at H and S, Silas meets Jonas, who is at stage 2 of the disease. Through Jonas, Silas meets a group of SOS sufferers who provide support to each other, most who neither deny or suppress to each other their want to experience these human feelings and emotions. Concurrently, Silas believes he sees in one of his coworkers, Nia, a writer, signs of SOS. He ultimately discovers that she indeed does suffer from SOS, and is a ""hider"", not disclosing these symptoms to anyone, let alone to H and S. Silas and Nia end up falling in love with each other, that love which feels right and not wrong as they were taught. Through the support group, Silas and Nia contemplate escaping to the Peninsula - the only known land mass that survived the war outside of the Collective control - their future there, if there is a future, uncertain. They have to balance these issues against the fact that a cure has been developed which would once again suppress their feelings for each other.—Huggo"

Love & Taxes is a riveting comic tale of seven years of tax avoidance. Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love & Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. Despite working for a high-powered tax attorney, Josh hasn't filed his taxes in seven years. Josh had what he recalls as a blissful childhood with his radical parents, living ""outside the system,"" and he has been clinging to that fringe identity for his whole life. But when his boss persuades him to join the system, almost mystically things start going well for Josh. His performing career takes off, his solo shows are ""optioned"" by major Hollywood studios, he and his brother Jake (Jacob Kornbluth, Inequality for All, Sundance 2013) decide to make movies together - and he meets the woman of his dreams, Sara. But while Sara wants Josh to join society and take care of his debts, Josh isn't paying attention to his finances. He and his brother Jake are busy trying to get Haiku Tunnel (Sundance 2001) into the Sundance Film Festival, and Josh has fallen for the manipulations of an unscrupulous tax lawyer, who now might own the rights to their film. Josh soon finds himself broke: his tax-avoidance problems have ballooned into a tax nightmare that threatens all of the great new things in his life. Love & Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story -- a tale showing that even those on the fringes of our political and economic system long to become providers. It is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy. Above all, Love & Taxes is the perfect comedy for our troubled political times."

Two Catholic schoolgirls Kat (Kiernan Shipka) and Rose (Lucy Boynton) get left behind at their boarding school over winter break as the other girls leave, where it's rumored that the nuns are satanists.

Kat (Kiernan Shipka), a freshman, has a dream where her father shows her the horribly smashed family car. She awakens from the dream, and marks off her calendar, looking forward to the day her parents will come. An older student, Rose (Lucy Boynton), worries she might be pregnant and intends to tell her boyfriend that night.
When both Kat and Rose's parents fail to pick them up before break, Rose confesses she told them the wrong date but doesn't disclose it's because she wants to delay them until she can tell her boyfriend about the pregnancy. Mr. Gordon, the headmaster, jokes that their parents will eventually show up since they can't live there forever. Kat is visibly upset, and the two nuns who are acting as chaperons reassure her that everything's fine and promise to keep calling her parents. They ask Rose to watch over Kat that night.
That night Rose tells Kat that she's going out. When Kat protests, Rose tries to unnerve her by telling her a story about the nuns at the school being devil-worshipers. She leaves Kat alone and gets in the car with her boyfriend. Kat hears a payphone ringing in the hall and picks up.
Meanwhile, a girl named Joan (Emma Roberts) gets off a bus in upstate New York and cleans herself up in the bus station bathroom.

Joan awakens in a hotel room. She takes a shower and a bullet scar can be seen on her shoulder. In a flashback, a police officer shoots a rifle. Bill knocks and tells Joan the reason he picked her up is because she reminds him of someone. He invites her to have dinner with him at the restaurant next door, where he shows Joan a picture of Rose, who is revealed to be his daughter. He explains she died nine years ago. Joan excuses herself and goes to the bathroom where she giggles and has a memory of killing a woman and stealing her identification card. Joan sees Bill talking to a cop and steals a knife from a bus tray. Bill tells her they have to hit the road to beat an impending storm and Joan goes to the car where Linda is waiting. Linda tells Joan that Bill sees Rose in every young girl but that she doesn't see Rose in Joan at all.
Rose tucks Kat in and tries to reassure her that her parents are on their way. Kat tells Rose she knows her parents are dead, which disturbs Rose. Rose goes back to her room and bars her door with a chair. Rose awakens and goes to breakfast with the two chaperons and Kat. Kat begins to act strangely and is unable to pray. When one of the chaperons begins to scold her, Kat stands up and vomits. As they try to nurse her, she lashes out at them. Mr. Gordon rings to tell them he will be coming back to the school. It is implied that Kat's parents have indeed died in a car crash. The women ask Rose to shovel the driveway for him. After shoveling, Rose tries to re-enter the chaperons' house but the doors are locked, so she returns to her dorm room.
When Mr. Gordon arrives at the house, he is accompanied by a police officer. Upon entering the house, Mr. Gordon grasps his face in horror. In a flashback, Kat is seen answering the payphone and hears a gravely voice on the other end, which she calls ""Dad."" It tells her that her parents aren't coming, and to kill everyone. Later, Kat is seen stabbing the two chaperons to death. While one of the victims crawls along the floor, mortally wounded, Kat casually walks upstairs and returns with two pillowcases. She then finishes the job. Rose goes to the bathroom and gets her period, sighing in relief. She hears someone enter the bathroom but then leave. When she goes to the dorm stairwell she sees two bloody heads wrapped in pillowcases and hurries back to the hall. Kat appears and stabs Rose to death before decapitating her.
The police officer finds Kat in the boiler room, kneeling in front of the lit boiler and surrounded by the heads of her three victims. She stands and begins to yell ""Hail Satan!"" When she fails to drop the knife, the cop shoots her in the shoulder.
Joan is in the car with Bill and Linda. Linda reveals to Joan that Rose was brutally murdered nine years earlier and decapitated. Joan says she's going to be sick and Bill pulls over. Joan then slashes Bill's throat and stabs Linda to death. She cuts off their heads and puts them in a suitcase which she carries to the boarding school, now all boarded up.
Father Brien visits Kat, now revealed to be a younger ""Joan"", in the psych ward and performs an exorcism. Kat sees a shadowed, demonic figure; she asks it to stay with her, but it disappears.

The Adderall Diaries,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1735907/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Elliot, a troubled former successful writer decides to write about a missing wife and the following murder trial of her husband. As a writer stymied by past success, writers block, substance abuse, relationship problems and a serious set of father issues, Elliott's cracked-out chronicle of a bizarre murder trial amounts to less than the sum of its parts. Not long into the 2007 trial of programmer Hans Reiser, accused of murdering his wife, the defendant's friend Sean Sturgeon obliquely confessed to several murders (though not the murder of Reiser's wife). Elliott, caught up in the film-ready twist and his tenuous connection to Sturgeon (they share a BDSM social circle), makes a record of the proceedings. The result is a scattered, self-indulgent romp through the mind of a depressive narcissist obsessed with his insecurities and childhood traumas.—Publisher's Weekly Writer and Adderall enthusiast Stephen Elliott reaches a low point when his estranged father resurfaces, claiming that Stephen has fabricated much of the dark childhood that fuels his writing. Adrift in the precarious gray area of memory, Stephen is led by three sources of inspiration: a new romance, the best friend who shares his history and a murder trial that reminds him more than a little of his own story. Stephen Elliott is a successful author with a troubling childhood. His mother died when he was a child and his father was physically and psychologically abusive. He has lived most of his life behaving very destructively and abusing drugs and committing petty vandalism. He had recently gotten a deal to write his next book and decided to write about Hans Reiser, a software guru who developed the Reiser file-system. He had a volatile marriage and his wife has gone missing. Despite his claims that his wife has simply gone into hiding to hurt him, the cops arrested him for her murder and he is now on trial. Stephen is attending court every day and following the case, in hopes of writing a best seller. His previous book was a memoir about his childhood that is about to get released. At the release party, he is reading from his book talking about how his late father hurt and abused him and his father Neil Elliott stands up in the crowd and calls him a liar. This causes him to question his childhood memories. In despair, he gets high, goes to a club, and sleeps with a random person. He wakes up in the middle of the next day and checks his voice-mails, which include his publisher dropping him for missing an important meeting, and a girl he was starting a relationship with dumping him. To make matters worse, he realizes that he also slept through the jury announcing their verdict on Hans Reiser, finding him guilty of murder. He connects with his father and realizes that he is dying and wants to make amends. While talking, he figures out that while Neil made some parenting mistakes, Stephen is falsely remembering his father being downright abusive. A recurring memory of his father handcuffing him until he bled was because Stephen was trying to kill himself and Neil was desperately trying to restrain him. In the end, he writes over the course of two days about making amends with his father. His agent reads it and loves it. She agrees to find him another publisher. Meanwhile, it is revealed in the news that Hans has finally admitted to killing his wife because she was going to leave him and take his kids and he killed her in anger. He has shown the cops where her body is buried in exchange for a lesser sentence."

And maybe some more? And maybe some more? Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot-say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance-literally to astonish his son's weak mind.Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.
Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often ""came down"" handsomely, and Scrooge never did.Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, ""My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?"" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, ""No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!""
But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call ""nuts"" to Scrooge.Once upon a time-of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve-old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-it had not been light all day-and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.""A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!"" cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach."

But soon they find that they are trapped in ""Camp Bloodbath 1"" with the characters Nancy, Kurt, Tina and Paula in the summer camp. Further, the serial-killer Billy Murphy is hunting them down.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film starts with a trailer for an old school ""Friday The 13th""-esque slasher film called ""Camp Bloodbath"", which features a group of counselors at Camp Blue Finch being terrorized by a masked killer named Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris). Watching the trailer on her phone is Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga). Her mother Amanda (Malin Akerman) was one of the leads in that film. Max waits for her mom as she leaves an audition. Amanda is a bit discouraged since she feels she is only known for ""Camp Bloodbath"" and has thus been typecast.The two drive away with Max telling Amanda all the bills she has to pay. She puts on the radio, which is playing Kim Carnes' ""Bette Davis Eyes"", Amanda's favorite song. Max then accidentally spills her milkshake on Amanda's headshot, distracting Amanda and causing her to hit a car, and then roll against traffic cones and tumble hard across the deserted street.Three years later, Max is now living with her aunt. Her best friend Gertie (Alia Shawkat) picks her up to go study at a diner with their friend Chris (Alexander Ludwig). Gertie's stepbrother Duncan (Thomas Middleditch) enters and pleads with Max to attend a double feature for ""Camp Bloodbath"" and its sequel, ""Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer"". Since the show falls on the anniversary of Amanda's death, Max refuses, but Duncan eventually convinces her to show up as a special guest.The four go to the double feature. They encounter Chris's ex-girlfriend and Max's former best friend Vicki (Nina Dobrev), who becomes a nuisance to the friends. They later watch the first movie, which plays to a huge crowd. Max feels a bit emotional watching her mom on the screen again. In the crowd, two guys pass around a liquor bottle, which gets dropped and rolls across the floor, spilling booze everywhere. Another guy lights up a cigarette, and the ash falls onto the liquor, igniting it and setting a curtain on fire that eventually spreads through the whole theater. The audience runs for the exits, blocking it for Max and her friends. She grabs a sharp item and leads Gertie, Chris, Duncan, and Vicki toward the screen. Max cuts through the screen and they enter through a blinding white light.The friends find themselves in the woods, right at the start of ""Camp Bloodbath"". The main counselors - horny idiot Kurt (Adam Devine) and bimbo Tina (Angela Trimbur) - drive by the friends and ask where Camp Blue Finch is. Not realizing what happened, the friends let the counselors drive away from them. They wait over two 92-minute periods (the film's runtime, twice) before the counselors return and Duncan tells Tina they are also counselors and would like a ride to the camp. In the van, the friends meet another counselor, Blake (Tory N. Thompson), and Amanda, in character as Nancy, the ""shy girl with a clipboard and guitar"".The group arrives at Camp Blue Finch. Duncan tries to get Kurt to give him the keys to the van so they can find a way out of the movie, but Kurt tosses the keys into the woods. Max tries to get Nancy away from Kurt, because her character is fated to die after having losing her virginity to him. The five friends then go into the woods to look for the keys, just as the first kills in the film are set to take place. The five watch as Billy shows up and kills two horny counselors. Billy appears to spot them, and everyone except Duncan runs. He realizes that since they're not part of the movie, Billy doesn't know what to do with them. Duncan thinks he's invincible, until Billy hurls his machete into Duncan's side, apparently killing him, and proving to the other four that they have no immunity.The film's badass final girl, Paula (Chloe Bridges), shows up to the camp. Since she is the one that kills Billy at the end of the film, the friends decide to stick with her, while also trying to stop anyone from having sex so that Billy won't show up. Billy is mentioned, and Nancy tells his urban legend, taking Max and her friends into a black-and-white flashback to 1957 when Billy was a camper. He was always made fun of for being different and ugly, so he hid in an outhouse to escape the bullying. One camper throws firecrackers into the outhouse, burning Billy's face and scarring him. After eight months in the burn ward, Billy went back to camp to exact his revenge. Now wearing a creepy mask and wielding his machete, he murdered eight counselors (one for each month of his time in the ward). As the friends watch Billy's murders, some blood sprays on Gertie's face. When they return from the flashback, the counselors see the blood on her face. Paula and Kurt panic, and Paula drives them both away in her car. Duncan emerges alive, but he gets hit by the car. Paula crashes into a totem pole, ejecting Kurt from the passengers seat and causing him to die with all his bones breaking. Paula meets her end when her car explodes.Max and her friends then reveal to the surviving counselors that they are all in a movie and that they need a new final girl to kill Billy. They even made Tina put on a life jacket with mittens (she is fated to die after doing a striptease). Since the final girl has to be a virgin, everyone thinks it should be Max. Max says Nancy should be the new final girl, but Vicki comments that she can't be because of who her character is (shy girl with a clipboard and guitar). Nancy runs away crying, so Max goes to console her. She wants to have Nancy survive so that they can make it out of the movie together and perhaps start a new life for Nancy/Amanda.The gang prepares for Billy's arrival that night. Vicki apologizes to Max and Gertie for her behavior, because she used to be good friends with Max before Amanda's death, and Max shut Vicki out and became friends with Gertie, making Vicki feel jealous and hurt. The girls forgive Vicki.The cabin has been booby-trapped in anticipation of Billy. Tina, who is hopped up on Vicki's adderall, does a crazy striptease and flashes her breasts, summoning Billy to the cabin. As he walks toward the cabin, Tina panics and runs away, tripping over a string and getting her head caught in a bear trap. Chris sets off another trap as Billy enters, wherein a log swings from the ceiling and knocks Billy into some antlers on the door to impale him. Thinking they've won, Gertie and Blake kiss. However, Billy is still alive and he kills Blake. The others run upstairs where Billy chases them. The heroes shoot flaming arrows at Billy's chest. He knocks a bookcase on top of Gertie and Vicki, and then impales Gertie with his machete. Max, Nancy, and Chris flee while Vicki takes Gertie's hand and drops a bucket of lighter fluid from the ceiling, causing an explosion. This doesn't kill Billy, and he bursts out the window on fire and in slow motion.The three run away (still in slo-mo) until Billy grabs Chris's leg and breaks the slo-mo. Chris gets stabbed while Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max brings Chris into an abandoned chapel and stays with him so he won't die alone, but Max assures him that he won't die. She runs to find Nancy in Billy's barn. Max fights Billy, but gets stabbed. Nancy gets Billy off Max and they run back to the chapel.Nancy realizes that since only the final girl can kill Billy, it has to be Max. Max breaks down in tears and tells Nancy who she is outside of the movie and how Max wished she could make her mom's dream of becoming a star come true. Nancy tells Max that she knows where to find her. Nancy walks out of the chapel and does a striptease to summon Billy. The killer emerges and impales Nancy with his machete. Max then walks out and dukes it out with Billy, eventually taking his machete and chopping his head off. Chris walks over to Nancy as the sun rises and the credits roll. They share a kiss. The film's rating stamp shows up before the reel starts to break off.Max wakes up in a hospital with Chris in the bed next to her. She hears voices and pulls back the curtain to find Duncan, Gertie, and Vicki, all alive. Max asks if it was a dream, but Duncan disproves that by showing off his machete wound. The friends look outside the room to find a doctor and nurse about to get intimate. Billy then bursts through the window, as the friends realize they are in the sequel. Max wastes no time in grabbing the nearest item and running to fight Billy again."

In the film, Ray (Skarsgård), Claire (Riseborough) and their seven-year-old daughter, Zoe, are an average American family in Kingsville, North Carolina - except they have existed in a bomb shelter since escaping a day of devastation that changed everything. For 301 days, they have transformed their cement prison into a home, holding on to memories of the past and hope for a normal life someday. And for 301 days, the family has eluded what looms above the surface - the heavy breathing and booming footsteps that punctuate the night, threatening their fragile existence. All the while, the family has managed to stay hidden. Until now. Now their safe haven has been breached... and something is coming for them.—John McLaughlan In Kingsville, Ray, his wife Claire and their little daughter Zoe ""Zozo"" have been living in an underground shelter for three hundred days hidden from the ""Breathers"". They have created and follow four rules to stay alive. Ray frequently recalls when an outbreak reached Kingsville and the army bombed the whole town during the quarantine, and he believes they are the only survivors. When they find that many supplies have been stolen from the pantry, Ray finds that a rat is the responsible. They chase the rodent and there is an accident with a kerosene lamp that burns a table. Now they are afraid that the ""Breathers"" might have seen the smoke. Will they be safe in the shelter?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An unknown strange outbreak has devastated the area of the United States. A family of three, Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), Claire (Andrea Riseborough) and their daughter Zoe (Emily Alyn Lind), have taken refuge in an abandoned fallout shelter shortly after the catastrophe to hide from the monsters outside. Zoe wakes one night after having a nightmare of the 'Breathers'. The family has difficulty coping in their cramped environment but manage by having a set of rules, such as always keeping calm and never leaving the shelter. The three soon discover at dinner that their already dwindling rations are also being consumed by a rat and try to find and kill it. The family also discovers that the rat managed to sneak into the shelter through an opening other than the main barricaded hatch. They find a small air duct but Ray reassures Zoe that the Breathers wouldn't be able to fit through the duct. They believe they may be the only ones left alive. The Breathers have been actively hunting down the family, and have nearly located them multiple times. Claire and Ray's priority is to keep Zoe alive, regardless of what happens to them.In a flashback, it is the beginning of the outbreak, 301 days ago. After the start of outbreak, Ray, Claire and Zoe drive along a highway fleeing their town, Kingsville, only to be stopped with many other people by the CDC. Signs all around state that they are under quarantine.Claire kills the rat but in the process, Ray accidentally knocks over one of their lamps, burning a wooden table. Having put out the fire, the family quickly realizes that the smoke produced from the fire is drifting up the air duct, giving away their position to anyone in the area. Later they discover that the smoke has left ash covered all above their shelter hatch, making their hiding place visible. Claire and Ray go to the surface to cover and hide their shelter but Zoe, using a homemade periscope, spots a humanoid figure in the distance. Disregarding her mother's rules, Zoe climbs through the barricade to the surface to warn her parents of the Breather. She manages to warn them and they all go back into the shelter, but are followed. Claire, Ray and Zoe try to keep quiet but Zoe's doll, Olive, gets caught on a nearby pipe screw and activates, making noises. The Breather attempts to break in. Others join and finally break through the hatch and into the shelter. Claire and Zoe manage to escape through the air duct but Ray is caught and disappears, followed by a spatter of blood. Claire and Zoe run and end up on the highway where they were stopped by the CDC.In another flashback, two fighter jets fly overhead and bomb the family's town. They rush to a nearby abandoned shelter as the rest of the town's population is decimated by the military. Claire accidentally cuts herself on a rusty piece of iron as she descends into the shelter and notices the flesh around the cut is discolored and her blood black. They deduce that the virus is airborne and they have already been infected.In the present, on the highway, Claire and Zoe are caught in a net fired from a helicopter. Breathers, actually American soldiers wearing night vision goggles and re-breather packs, surround them with automatic rifles. The soldiers test Claire and Zoe's blood and interrogate them to find out if there are any others in the vicinity. Afterwards, the soldiers prepare to execute them. Ray suddenly appears and kills one of the soldiers. Ray has black arteries and veins and bloodshot eyes. He incapacitates three more soldiers, demonstrating remarkable physical strength and agility, and is shot multiple times before falling. Claire and Zoe escape from their net, and an enraged Claire transforms like Ray, killing all but one soldier, who injures her. Before he is able to kill Claire, a transformed Zoe appears and exposes the soldier to the air by removing his re-breather, infecting him. Zoe, in her enraged state, almost attacks and kills Claire, but Claire reminds her of their rule to always keep calm. Claire and Zoe sit with Ray during his final moments. Claire notices the helicopter coming back and the two flee.The two find a sewer system nearby and hide there. They hear someone approaching, who turns out to be Joe, Zoe's friend and next door neighbor. He has survived and leads them to others just like them within the underground sewers. Before Zoe and Claire join the group of infected survivors, Zoe notes how they managed to survive to day 302 while looking at the sun rising through a nearby window. Claire says ""Not days,"" implying that their days are really ""miracles"", something Ray called each day at the beginning of the film. Claire looks up into the window before climbing through the sewer hole, revealing her blood shot eyes."

The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1883367/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Taking inspiration from The Human Centipede films, the warden of a notorious and troubled prison looks to create a 500-person human centipede as a solution to his problems. Bully prison warden Bill Boss, leading a big state prison in the US of A, has a lot of problems; his prison statistically has the highest amount of prison riots, medical costs and staff turnover in the country. But foremost he is unable to get the respect he thinks he deserves from his inmates and the state Governor. He constantly fails in experimenting with different ideas for the ideal punishment to get the inmates in line, which drives him, together with the sizzling heat, completely insane. Under threats of termination by the Governor, his loyal right hand man Dwight comes up with a brilliant idea. A revolutionary idea which could change the American prison system for good and save billions of dollars. An idea based on the notorious Human Centipede movies, that will literally and figuratively get the inmates on their knees, creating the ultimate punishment and deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Having nothing to lose, Bill and Dwight create a jaw-dropping 500-person prison centipede.—Ashton Brandon Brown Prison warden Bill Boss has tried everything to keep his inmates in line, but nothing works. When riots, staff turmoil and scorching heat finally drive him to the brink, Boss agrees to a horrific plan to turn the prisoners into a human centipede.—Ilir Sejdiu A brutal, deranged prison warden, Bill Boss, knows no limits or laws when it comes to maintaining discipline in his prison, and in carrying out his sadistic urges. Then, influenced by watching the Human Centipede movies, his sidekick Dwight suggests that he create a human centipede out of the prisoners. It will cut their food costs.—grantss William ""Bill"" Boss (Dieter Laser), a psychopathic prison warden in New Mexico, watches the end of The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant, Dwight Butler (Laurence R. Harvey). Bill says that he hates the films as his feet are massaged by his assistant, Daisy (Bree Olson). Daisy replies that she enjoyed them. In response, Bill sucks his finger and inserts it into Daisy's vagina, telling her that women should not be allowed to voice their opinions. Dwight interrupts, attempting to pitch a ""brilliant idea"" to fix the prison's horrible retention and violence rates, but he is interrupted by a phone call.Bill and Dwight are then summoned to the scene of an assault within the prison. One of the officers has been stabbed by an inmate. For punishment, Bill decides to stomp on the arm of the prisoner (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), exposing the bone and causing immense pain. He promises to do it again when his bones are healed.Back in the Warden's office, Bill receives a mysterious package. After Dwight asks what it contains, Bill reveals that it is a jar of specially imported, dried African clitorises which he eats ""for strength."" After eating a few, he receives a threatening prank phone call from one of the inmates (Jay Tavare). Bill waterboards him with three buckets of boiling water, horribly disfiguring him. The inmate tells Bill that he has lost his soul.Governor Hughes (Eric Roberts) arrives immediately afterwards, ordering Bill and Dwight to put a stop to the violence and promising that they will both be fired otherwise. In anger and retaliation, Bill orders a 'mass castration' of the inmates, and castrates one of the prisoners (Robert LaSardo) himself. He covers his face in the blood of the inmate and later eats the cooked testicles for lunch, calling it ""Energy Food."" Daisy is forced to perform fellatio on Bill while Dwight is in the room. Upon completing the act, Daisy eats one of the dried clitorises, mistaking them for candy.Finally, Dwight is able to pitch his idea to Bill. Inspired by the first two Human Centipede films, Dwight suggests that all of the prisoners are sutured together mouth-to-anus, forming a giant human prison centipede, claiming that it will be the ultimate deterrent for anyone considering a life of crime. Initially, Bill is opposed to the idea and dismisses it as impossible. However, Bill then has a nightmare about being attacked by the inmates, expressing weakness, and being raped in the kidney by the inmate he castrated. He then becomes visibly more desperate for a means of protection from his inmates.When the director himself, Tom Six, is summoned to the prison, Bill warms up to Dwight's idea after being assured that it is ""100% medically accurate."" Six gives the prison permission to use his Centipede idea, provided that he is permitted to witness the operation.The first two films are then screened in the prison canteen, showing the prisoners what is going to happen to them. A riot breaks out, and several guards are injured. Bill and Dwight flee to the Warden's office as they are being chased by prisoners. The prisoners eventually make it to the office, where one inmate beats Daisy into a coma as another masturbates to the sight. Bill jumps out of the window, just as backup arrives and manages to herd the prisoners back to their cells.Bill then goes around each cell and shoots every inmate with tranquilizers, readying them for the operation. It transpires that some inmates are not compatible for the centipede; one inmate has a stoma, and another is disabled, so Bill kills them both, by placing his gun inside the inmate's stoma and shooting him, and then shooting the disabled inmate in the head. They also discover an inmate with Crohn's disease, who has constant diarrhea. Bill orders the castrated man who raped him in a dream to be attached to him as an added punishment. Bill and Dwight go and visit Daisy, who is now in a coma. Dwight reveals that he loves her as Bill rapes her motionless body, despite Dwight's protests.Tom Six returns to the prison, where he is met by Bill and Dwight. Touring the cells, the trio discover a mentally unstable inmate who is eating his own feces and wants to be sewn into the centipede. Not wanting anyone to enjoy the centipede punishment, Bill shoots and kills the inmate. Bill and Dwight observe the operation with Six, who vomits after seeing the death row inmates being dismembered for a ""special project.""With the 500-person centipede now complete, Governor Hughes arrives and is disgusted at what he sees. Not only has a Human Centipede been created, but a 'Human Caterpillar' has also been created out of the inmates serving life sentences. This is the same as a Human Centipede, only the limbs of the victims have been removed, meaning they cannot move. It is revealed that Daisy has also been accidentally sewn into the Centipede. Hughes concludes that Dwight and Bill are insane and should get the death penalty before leaving the prison in abhorrence.Bill murders Dr. Jones (Clayton Rohner). Hughes then returns to the prison with a sudden change of heart, stating that the Centipede punishment is ""exactly what America needs.""The film ends with Dwight and Bill celebrating their success. But then Bill shoots and kills Dwight for trying to take credit for the idea, even though it was his idea in the first place."

Colonia,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4005402/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman's desperate search for her abducted boyfriend draws her into the infamous Colonia Dignidad, a sect nobody has ever escaped from. Lena and Daniel, a young couple become entangled in the Chilean military coup of 1973. Daniel is abducted by Pinochet's secret police and Lena tracks him to a sealed off area in the South of the country, called Colonia Dignidad. The Colonia presents itself as a charitable mission run by lay preacher Paul Schäfer but, in fact, is a place nobody ever escaped from. Lena decides to join the cult in order to find Daniel. Based on true events.—Producer It starts when we see Lena (Emma Watson) working as an air hostess on a Chile bound plane. She then travels into the center of Santiago with the rest of the crew who are shown to be a strong group of friends, (she is particularly close to the pilot, Roman) until their van meets the chaos caused by a left wing political rally. Lena then recognizes her boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Brühl) as a lead speaker of the event. He is surprised and overjoyed to see Lena as her arrival was a surprise after a long time apart.The film then shows us that they are in a serious long distance relationship as she presumably lives in Britain (based on the other crew members' English accents) and he is living in Chile. They kiss each other and Lena picks up the camera to take photos of the moment. After this, we see Daniel developing the photos, most of which are related to his political activities. Whilst eating together, the telephone rings and Daniel is warned by his friend that due an unfolding coup by the Pinochet regime they must vacate the flat immediately. They run onto the street attempting to flee the soldiers who are rounding up everybody. However, they too are caught because Daniel was photographing the event.The army takes the detainees to the main sport stadium in the city at gunpoint, where a man, with his face obscured, identifies anyone who is supposedly against the new right wing government. Daniel is dragged away into a vehicle resembling an ambulance along with other dissidents whilst Lena is free to go.After this Lena goes to meet the other people who were present at Daniel's rally. She asks them to help her find her husband but she is simply told that there is nothing they can do as he has been taken south to a place called Colonia Dignidad (Colony of Dignity), a place that doesn't live up to its name. It is a dark cult from which no one has ever escaped. Dissidents are sent there by the army to suffer, and in return the complex stores their arms.Desperate to rescue her boyfriend, Lena now dressed plainly like a nun with a crucifix takes the bus towards the colony. The colony is in a remote location accessed across several fields from the road, she walks along its high security outer fence towards the main gate, after knocking on the gate she is admitted to the secure complex at which point her passport is confiscated by a senior cult member Gisela (Richenda Carey).Immediately she witnesses the dark nature of the place when a crying child is upset and Lena is admonished for comforting him by a senior cult member. Stripped of her possessions, she is taken to see the leader, Paul Schäfer called Pious (Mikael Nyqvist), who interviews her about why she is there. She lies that she is there to seek God, however she isn't believed. Pious forces her to strip, and we see that she is wearing more modern clothes underneath. He labels her a harlot because of this and she is questioned further. Her lie that she is there because she needs him is believed, at which point she becomes a member of the cult and agrees not to try and leave the complex.Meanwhile, we see that Daniel has been tortured by the army until Pious turns up pretending to be a caring savior of those being tortured by the army. Throughout his recovery from this Daniel plays dumb, pretending to be called Hans. Under this false identity he is given light duties, and when he is caught exploring out of bounds areas, he isn't punished .Through Lena we witness the brutal reality of the place. She must work long hours in a field, in a manner not unlike slavery. Once, after collapsing from exhaustion she is flogged. Begging for water, she is given a bucket full of clean water which she is forbidden from drinking. We see that she is locked in a communal cell at night and that the women who are separated from the men are psychologically abused. They only meet men in what is called a communal parade, performed for important guests. One confused woman Doro (Jeanne Werner) believed she was going to marry a man from this parade who she met only once three years ago. Because of Lena's mistake who tells Gisela about Doro's plans having no idea that it was her secret Doro was taken to a ""men's gathering,"" a form of ritualized abuse where women are told by Pious and their ""fiance"" that they are ugly, dirty, and unloved . This whole marriage sham was cruelly concocted by the cult leaders to cause anguish to the women and Doro ended in hospital while Lena, hidden, watched the gathering. Pious states that breaking a person without harming them physically is an art. He is also shown to be sexually abusing younger children, who were separated from their parents at birth to live a life of slavery.In a hope to meet Daniel, Lena swims naked in a river in order to be taken to the men's gathering, to cleanse her of her ""indecency"". However she didn't see Daniel there as he was trying to escape that night. In doing so he sets off an alarm which calls the men to find ""Hans"" with guns. This means that Lena avoided a beating, and by being a ""retard"" Hans isn't punished. They are unaware of each other's presence in the camp until the next communal parade, where Daniel hears that the army will test Sarin gas on, as he is seen as worthless.Thus they agree to meet in the barn where Lena works each night. Daniel gets there by volunteering for additional work. Accidentally he discovers tunnels under the complex and steeling a camera from the shed he photographs them finding also the room where he was tortured. Next time they meet Daniel gives the photos to Lena who is not pleased with the danger that the photos put them in. With Gisela coming, he hides in the tunnel in the barn whilst Lena hides the photos under a bucket. Lena is now joined by Ursel (Vicky Krieps), Gisela's daughter, a member of her own status, to peel the potatoes. Unequipped for the job, Gisela goes away to get a knife. Seeing upon her return that no peeling has been done, the girls are ordered to move apart and the photos are discovered. Unsuccessfully denying all knowledge Lena appears to be in trouble until Hans steps in to frame his boss saying that he found them in the tool shed. The two are then dismissed, and Lena knocks out Gisela who was escorting her back to her quarters, and she returns to the barn to meet Daniel who found that the next day the Sarin experiment would be performed on him and this is his last chance to escape through tunnels that he believes lead to outside world.So Lena and Ursel (who lived in Colonia since her childhood believing in their ideas, but now is pregnant and disappointed, knowing her baby and probably her as well will be killed by the cult) immediately enter the tunnels following Daniel, who gets them to the other side of the fence. Lena and Daniel escape while Ursel is killed by a tripwire-operated gun. During this time they are being pursued after Pious realizes that Hans is intelligent after discovering in a mattress the sedatives used in the cult's mind-control techniques.Now almost free, they hitchhike to the German embassy in Santiago to get new passports, but they learn that the embassy is in cahoots with the cult, which was founded in Chile by German Neo-Nazis.Despite the embassy being deliberately unhelpful, Lena uses her contacts at the airline to book herself and Daniel onto a flight. Carefully guarding their photos as they are taken to the airport by the ambassador, Lena becomes suspicious about being driven through the back entrance. Locked in a side room she sees that the embassy have brought Pious and the army after them, so she smashes a window and they escape the room just in time. Running through the airport they hear the final call for their flight, despite being told by the embassy they were early, and they can see the plane some distance across the airfield closing its door.As the action intensifies they can see Pious through a window where Daniel spits at the glass. They steal a baggage truck to race towards the plane where Roman orders the door to be opened. Pursued by the cult and the army, they board the plane just in time, leaving Pious trapped on the steps. The army forces the airport control tower to order the plane to not take off. Sensing the danger they are in, and fueled by his loyalty to his good friend Lena, Captain Roman ignores this order and takes off anyway, saving Lena and Daniel.The credits then roll after some information detailing what happened to the real life Pious, who died in 2004 in a Chilean prison."

Is there an escape from the killer beach?—Nick Riganas The film opens to a group of friends are having a party at the beach with some of their classmates because it's the first night of spring break. While one of the friends, Heather (Etalvia Cashin), is filming the party with her video camera, two of the boys named Vance (Hector David Jr.) and Gilbert (Cleo Berry) find a giant ball covered in a strange gooey substance. The party continues, with all party guests having to put their phones in a bag so the party can't be seen online.The next morning, two of the friends, Kaylee (Brooke Butler) and Mitch (Mitchel Musso) awake on the lifeguard building. Kaylee's boyfriend Jonah (Dean Geyer) awakens in a nearby car next to a girl named Chanda (Meagan Holder). In the back of the car are Vance, and his girlfriend Ronnie (Cynthia Murell). Gilbert wakes up, having been stuck in a trashcan and a topless girl named Marsha (Nikki Leigh) wakes up, having fallen asleep on a table. The rest of the teenagers, including Heather, are nowhere to be found, just a bunch of empty sleeping bags and beach blankets left in their place.Kaylee sees a bird get sucked into the sand. Marsha, who thinks Heather has stolen her top, goes to find her. Kaylee warns Marsha not to touch the sand but she does so anyway. Marsha becomes visibly distressed when she can't move, so Vance goes to help her but he finds that he can't move when touches the sand either. Both Vance and Marsha are gruesomely killed as their bodies sink into the sand, much to the horror of their friends. Jonah sees the cracked egg on the edge of the beach and concludes that whatever hatched from it has burrowed under the sand and killed everyone during the night, including Vance, Heather and Marsha.The group cannot call for help as the phones are locked in the trunk of the car, so Mitch and Kaylee toss raw hot-dogs at different ends of the beach to see how big the creature is. When one of the hot-dogs doesn't sink into the sand, the group is hopeful, but realize it's way too far way to reach. Jonah takes two of his surfboards and makes a bridge to reach the table Marsha had slept on. Jonah makes it but not before the creature has slashed his stomach, leaving a wound that starts to seep pus (revealing that the unseen creature has venom tipped hairs). While he is injured, Jonah notes to the others that the creature won't go near the fireplace, indicating it hates fire.About an hour later, Ronnie and Chanda attempt to retrieve the phones from the trunk of the car, but it results in Ronnie getting her fingers stuck in the door of the trunk instead. Not long after, a beach patrolman named Alex (Jamie Kennedy) drives onto the beach.

Mitch decides to get to the truck by putting his flip-flops on, spraying his feet and wrapping them up in towels so as to protect his feet.Chanda throws a towel at him, but Mitch falls over and breaks the banister on the boardwalk, causing him to fall. Mitch is then devoured by the sand creature in a gruesome fashion. Kaylee, after a brief moment of sadness, takes charge. She has Chanda take the broken pieces of the boardwalk and use them as a bridge to get to Jonah. Before they do that, the girls manage to pull Ronnie's broken fingers from the trunk and bind her wound. Gilbert cuts his stomach on the trashcan when he attempts to move, alerting the creature.Kaylee, Chanda and Ronnie all walk across the makeshift bridge to Jonah. However Ronnie trips and, despite Kaylee spraying the area where she fell, is killed and sucked into the ground.

Gilbert ends up being attacked by the creature, which kills him and sucks his body through the trashcan. The creature also bangs against the truck, knocking Chanda unconscious.At nightfall, Chanda wakes up and recuperates. She gets to the back of the truck where a raft is.

MI5 personnel are caught up in a traffic jam in London while escorting the CIA's most wanted terrorist to an arranged CIA handover point, when he is suddenly rescued by armed men on motorbikes. Harry Pearce, the head of Counter-Terrorism at MI5 is blamed for the terrorist escaping. Especially as Harry disappeared shortly after the incident. An ex-agent, Will Holloway, and protégé of Harry's is recalled by MI5 to assist in finding and bringing Harry in. However Harry has disappeared for a reason. Certain that there is a traitor in a senior position in MI5, he enlists the somewhat reluctant Will to help him in uncovering the rat or rats concerned.—Woodland Outlaw Jihadist terrorist Adem Qasim was to be delivered to the CIA by MI5 convoy, but klutz June Keaton's supervisor gets shot when she gives chase against orders after perfectly organized motor-bikers take enough hostages to convince counter terrorism chief Harry Pearce to accept an impromptu exchange, realizing that costs him his job. Seeking to settle that score, Harry tricks Will Holloway, the son of his Berlin-killed best agent, whom he fired dubiously but whom the brass now made return from his dangerous new career in the Moscow underworld to trap Harry, to 'defect' with him. Although not amused, Will accepts, promised the truth about his ever-absent father's end, to look for a mole, who proves dangerous enough covering his tracks, and take on Qasem while testing Harry's theory that the secret agenda was not just his downfall but the end of MI5, to be reduced to a CIA appendage. Harry strikes a risky deal with Qasem, which requires working with the Russian FSB.—KGF Vissers In London, while transporting the CIA's most wanted terrorist Adem Qasim to handover to CIA personnel, the MI5 team is trapped in a traffic jam and is forced to deliver the terrorist to a group of armed men on motorcycles. The Chief of the Operations, Harry Pearce, is blamed for the fleeing and vanishes immediately after simulating a suicide. The MI5 summons the former agent Will Holloway to help the agency to capture Harry, since his father and him worked with Harry. Soon Will meets Harry and learns that there is a traitor in the direction of the MI5 and invites Will to work with him. But Will is not sure whether Harry is telling the truth. Meanwhile the terrorist Qasim is threatening to blow-up locations in London unknown by the MI5.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil After an extremely dangerous terrorist escapes from MI-5 custody, Harry Pearce disappears, making it look as though he might have had something to do with it. MI-5 looks to Will Holloway, an ex-agent who trained under Pearce, to head into the field in order to bring him in. However, Pearce tells Holloway that he is only hiding because he is certain that someone high up within MI-5 is the one behind it, and eventually is able to convince Holloway to work alongside him to bring justice. Throughout the movie, these two are on the run from MI-5, looking for their lost terrorist, as well as trying to find out who the leak is inside of the agency. There are many different, albeit small, plotlines to follow, but they come together to make a good film that keeps you engaged.
While on the run from the agents at MI-5, Holloway has a run in with one of the ones involved in the prisoner transport. He trusts her in order to find out who the mole is within MI-5, but later is betrayed by her, although he makes it through that situation. However, she says that she was simply following orders, but won't admit who the one giving them was. Still running, Pearce ends up getting in touch with the terrorist that escaped, and wants to meet with him for the purpose of stopping his bombing plans and recapturing him. The terrorist is only willing to meet if Pearce can get his pregnant wife out of another agency's custody and reunite the two of them, to which Pearce agrees. Another speed bump comes when he retrieves his wife, but she and the child are already dead, causing Pearce and Holloway to think of a new plan. They call one of the MI-5 agents chasing them, and ask if she is able to help out by posing as the terrorist's wife, as they are to meet on a public bridge.They do this, and the terrorist has one of his men shoot the women from a rooftop, knowing it was not his wife.
Unbeknownst to the viewers, Pearce makes a deal with the terrorist to give up the location of all the bomb equipment, and MI-6 seizes it all, and Pearce and Holloway end up back at headquarters. While there, the terrorist makes his way inside the building, seeming to know all the passwords, locations of keys, and anything else needed to make their way through secure areas. Pearce is asked what he gave him in order to get him to give over the bomb materials, and he replies, ""I gave them you,"" directing attention to the 'man in charge.' Holloway and the woman who betrayed him earlier ended up killing the rest of the terrorists, and Holloway ended up getting a clear shot to the main terrorist, killing him, and ending the major plot of the movie. Pearce sacrificed a few lives of some of the security, as well as giving the terrorists the corrupt leader in their midst, in order to prevent public loss on a much larger scale. Holloway was not a fan of his recklessness in terms of caring for the lives of innocent people, but in the end, understood that many lives were saved.
From there, it flashes to a bit of a brighter future, where Holloway is being asked to join MI-5 for his outstanding courage, and his tremendous ability in taking down the terrorists. Pearce was originally thought to have sabotaged Holloways first attempt at joining the agency, and finally admits that he did it because Holloway's father lost his life fighting for them, and he didn't want that for his son as well.

He Never Died,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2386404/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jack, a social outcast, is thrust out of his comfort zone when the outside world bangs on his door and he can't contain his violent past. Jack's in a rut. Depression and severe anti-social behavior has whittled down his existence to sleeping and watching television. He spends his days in a diner, playing church bingo, and sleeping. When some hired thugs show up, Jack's life is stirred up and the question of his existence comes to light.—Anonymous The primary character ""Jack"" is a man who bears the weight of an incredibly long and violent life, stretching back to the beginnings of human history. As the movie unfolds, we learn his real name is Quayin which, translated from Hebrew is ""Cain."" Eventually, Cain relocated to the United States and worked at numerous jobs as he continued his life of mayhem, violence and cannibalism. When questioned about his work he responded with the list: boxer, bodyguard, antique dealer, business owner, construction, truck driver, history teacher, soldier, manager, landscaper, bootlegger, wreck diver, miner of coal, silver and gold, movie stunt man, medic, nurse, cook, prisoner, gambler, horse breeder, potter, tinsmith, blacksmith, mechanic, and retail sales. Jack has decided that killing and eating humans is no longer his life's purpose. He is depressed and withdrawn. He sleeps most of the day and dreams of horrific chaos. He spends his waking hours walking, watching TV, playing bingo and eating at a local diner. He limits his human contact and refuses to eat meat. He subsists on blood supplied by a paid medic from a local hospital. His dreary routine is interrupted by some local thugs who seek to collect a debt from the medic who supplies his blood. He beats them up in his dead pan offhand way and demonstrates his considerable strength and ability to recover from any injury, albeit by painfully extracting bullets lodged in his immortal self-repairing flesh.To complicate things further, his alcoholic 19-year-old daughter seeks him out. She is the result of his last brief liaison with a woman for ""less than a month."" His daughter is kidnapped by the bad guy debt collectors and Jack must decide if he cares enough to try to save her.By now the violence and blood-letting has reawakened his taste for human flesh and he is noshing on human fingers and other body parts as well as licking up human blood from the floor with his tongue, soaking up the remaining blood with a sponge, squeezing it into a glass and drinking it, while muttering ""This could be bad."" One of the more gruesome acts is his use of needle nose pliers to extract a bullet lodged in his brain. So we get it, nothing can kill him and with considerable pain he can recover from any injury.After engaging in some old testament mayhem, Jack interrogates an injured thug and learns that a former criminal associate wants to punish Jack by kidnapping and hurting Jack's daughter. Jack decides to run away and leave his daughter to the bad guys who have already killed her mother. After stuffing a duffel bag with money and precious mementos of his past, Jack runs from his apartment and ends up sitting in an alley chewing on a bad guy's severed finger and contemplating the contents of his duffel bag. He pulls out an ancient Roman knife and, with a thoughtful look, reads the inscription ""leginum conviction scientia veritate"" as he hefts and squeezes the knife. The Latin phrase means: ""Legion: Certainty of belief and knowledge of truth."" So, Jack packs the knife in his bag and in the next scene he surprises his ""girlfriend"" by asking her to help rescue his daughter. Ultimately he confronts his evil former associate and brutally twists and snaps his foot to make him immobile as he hands his beat-up daughter to his girlfriend for a trip to the hospital. He comments that he is not rescuing his daughter for her sake or even in order to confront his enemy. He says, ""I'm doing this for me.""The movie ends with Jack's one-sided confrontation with a man with a goatee (whom others can't see) and his avowed intent to dismember and eat the injured, evil criminal foe. His foe leans on a bar and listens in amazement as Jack yells and curses at the invisible man. Just then, Jack's cannibalistic intent is interrupted by a plea to help his daughter get to the hospital. After some verbal abuse from his girlfriend, he realizes his primary responsibility is to his daughter, so he leaves to go to the hospital without consuming his foe. As Jack steps away, he turns to his foe and tells him he will eventually see who Jack was talking to. As Jack leaves, the camera shifts to show the man with the goatee and Jack's badly injured opponent alone at the bar. The man stares at the wounded man and in a booming voice says ""Hi"" as the movie fades to black.Synopsis Submitted by Joel W. Benson"

Pau cannot resist taking a picture and sending it to one of his friends, Ivan, who quickly arrives with Javi, his other friend, at the morgue to view Anna's nude body.Ivan ponders out loud if it is possible to rape a corpse and Pau replies that saliva must be used for lubrication. When asked whether he knows this from past experience, Pau confesses he has raped the corpse of a 17 or 18-year-old girl. Ivan soon decides that he wants to rape Anna's corpse and begins raping it, prompting Pau to suggest that he take a turn after Ivan. Javi is disgusted when they suggest he takes a turn and refuses. During their act of necrophilia, however, Anna suddenly returns to life and opens her eyes while Pau is raping her. She cannot move, but her eyes are open in terror. Pau screams when he realizes this and the others come into the room.The men are then faced with two choices: They can either report Anna's revival and face rape charges, as there was no way Anna could have consented to sex, or they can murder her and cover up their crimes. While Pau and Ivan both want to hide their crime, Javi pushes for them to save Anna and take responsibility for what they have done. The three men argue and Ivan unintentionally kills Javi. Without Javi to stop them, Ivan is set on killing Anna. Ivan convinces Pau that he would be an accessory to the murder of Javi, and that there is no way Anna would stay silent if she is left alive.They decide to smother her with bunched up sheets so no mark is left on her body. While Ivan disposes of the evidence, Pau cleans Anna's body and covers her in a white sheet. As he is about to leave, Pau tells Anna to pretend she is dead and it is revealed that he faked the murder. Ivan returns and they both leave the room. As they are about to get on the elevator, Ivan checks his wallet and realizes he forgot his card in the morgue. Pau unsuccessfully tries to convince him to leave rather than get his card, saying he will pick it up the next day. Ivan opens the door to see Anna putting on a hospital gown.Ivan furiously starts to choke Pau, accusing him of conspiring to blame all of it on him. He finally stops, announcing that he does not care anymore if Pau wants to go to jail. Anna sneaks up behind him and stabs him twice. He bleeds to death from the wound in his neck. Pau cries, saying that Ivan had already said he would leave. Silent, Anna repeatedly stabs Pau. Anna is then seen staring off with tears in her eyes and blood spatter on her face."

A fallen warrior rises against a corrupt and sadistic ruler to avenge his dishonored master in a sword-clashing adventure of loyalty, honor, and vengeance.—Lionsgate When the corrupt minister Geza Mott demands more taxes from Lord Bartok, he goes to his castle with Commander Raiden and his knights. He challenges Geza Mott and tries to kill him but the Emperor sentences him to be beheaded by Raiden. Further, he deprives the castle and lands from his family. Geza Mott asks his commander to follow Raiden and builds an iron gate in the entrance of his castle expecting revenge, but Raiden prefers to drink instead becoming a drunkard. One year later, the knights want to seek revenge against the dishonor of their Lord. Geza Mott has neglected his security since Raiden is an alcoholic bum. What will happen to Raiden?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Burdened by the unbearable guilt of what he has done, Raiden--the battle-scarred swordsman and the once-proud Commander of the Seventh Rank--still drowns his sorrows, one long year later. However, as Geza Mott--the corrupt minister responsible for Raiden's fall from grace--fortifies his castle for fear of being targeted, Raiden's insuppressible values of duty, loyalty, and honour demand immediate action. Can Raiden confront his inner demons to finally reunite with his old comrades in arms, for one last battle for justice?—Nick Riganas Bartok watches over his estate, a vassal kingdom to a great empire. Protecting the Bartok clan is Commander Raiden and his elite soldiers, who serve and protect Bartok. Raiden is surprised when Bartok tells him he is to be his heir, and gives him a sword. The empire has become corrupted and the evil minister, Geza Mott, humiliates Bartok by beating him with a stick for failing to provide an adequate bribe, until Bartok retaliates which is treason against the crown. Bartok is put to trial where he speaks openly of his disdain for what honour has become in the empire. He is sentenced to death and Raiden is ordered to execute his own master. Bartok's estate is divided and Raiden and the Bartok clan is disbanded. Geza Mott suspects Raiden will demand vengeance, and has his trusted warrior, Ito, watch Raiden to ensure there is no possibility of revenge.A year passes and we find Raiden is now a drunk. Geza is still highly fearful of Raiden's wrath and demands half his father-in-law's troops to safeguard him while he completes construction of his newly fortified estate, more soldiers than the emperor's own security detail. Raiden's wife, Naomi, couldn't bear to be with him as he had fallen so low, with Raiden even selling his sword for more drink. When Bartok's virgin daughter is offered to Raiden in a whorehouse he shows no concern for her, but leaves the premises. Geza finally relaxes and stops watching Raiden. It is now revealed that Raiden and the Bartok clan soldiers sacrificed everything for the illusion of a complete defeat, and have been waiting for the right time to gather together and regain the clan honour by avenging their master's death.Raiden's men have been working in secret, building up contacts and connections, and gathering intelligence about Geza's estate - even secretly altering his estate to help them in their cause. As Raiden's men infiltrate the estate, we find that Auguste secretly made a pact with Raiden to help him, in exchange for Raiden's help to free his daughter from her marriage to Geza Mott. Geza has always mistreated Auguste's daughter which, along with Bartok's execution, causes Auguste to see that his vicious son-in-law has no honour. Raiden and his men successfully infiltrate Geza's estate, are discovered, and Raiden's group has to face a large number of soldiers.Raiden's men fall one by one as they enter deep into Geza's estate. Ito took responsibility for his complacency and duels with Raiden, but unfortunately Ito's sword fails and Raiden kills him. Raiden breaks into Geza's bedroom and decapitates him. With Geza dead, Raiden's surviving group rescue Bartok's daughter and tell her that Bartok's honour is restored. The Emperor discusses with his council how to deal with Bartok's soldiers, and they caution him against the risk of turning the people against the crown. They realise that the public view Geza's death a righteous one, and widely support the Bartok clan. The council strongly suggests that any judgement should restore their honour, rather than make them martyrs. Raiden asks that he be the only one executed for Geza's death.The crown publicly admits the righteousness of the Bartok clan, but also reminds the crowd that killing a high council member is still the same as an attack on the emperor and Raiden will be executed. Before his execution, Raiden charges Lt. Cortez to take control of the surviving Bartok clan. Once inside, he sees Naomi one last time to apologize for her suffering before making peace with his own life. Raiden lowers his head with his eyes closed, and as the executioner draws back his sword, Raiden's eyes suddenly open wide and the screen goes to black . . . leaving hope that he survived."

He'll do anything to get it back from AlexisOlga Kurylenko. Alex, a mysterious thief, is pulled in by her former partner for one last heist and quickly finds it was never just about the diamonds.

But soon, Kevin is brutally murdered by a crew of criminals led by the Mr. Washington (James Purefoy) and Alexix, who is a former CIA agent, learns that they have been hired by an American Senator (Morgan Freeman) to retrieve a flash drive that was hidden with the diamonds.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Pre-credits you hear a U.S. senator (Morgan Freeman) speaking to some unseen defense contractors. They are planning to orchestrate an event that will result in a war for them and a higher political office for him.The first scene opens in a bank in South Africa (Cape Town?). A robber gang of four, dressed in mysterious and futuristic garb (they have rows of different colored lights on their suits for identification and all their voices sound the same because they have been electronically modified) ruthlessly torture the bank manager until he opens the safe. The ""key"" to the safe is the manager's body and after an initial failure, the robbers shove two teeth that they had knocked out back in place, which works to open the safe. The thieves only open and remove the contents of one safety deposit box, which contains diamonds and one other small, unidentified, item. We begin to differentiate between the robbers. Red light and green light appear to be the leaders and violet light seems to be a hot-head who was apparently recruited by the fourth member, blue light. Red light gets in a fight with violet light and they shoot each other. Violet light is hit in the upper shoulder or neck, which does little damage, and red light takes only a nick to the cheek. They struggle and Red lights mask is pulled off, revealing a beautiful young red-haired woman. All the hostages see her face and blue light says she must kill all of them because she's been compromised. She says no and about that time violet light struggles back up and is shot again, this time with fatal result. All the robbers leave the bank and ride away in a van. Blue light removes his mask revealing a bearded man who is very angry with the woman because his friend violet light (Wayne) is dead and because she didn't kill all the witnesses and when green light (also a man) comes to her defense he also turns his anger on him. The woman knocks him unconscious with a left-handed backwards punch. As the thieves split up, the woman reminds the bearded man to lay low for a month and then he will receive ""30,000"".The man and the woman (now identified as ""Alex"" or ""Alexis Farraday"" (Olga Kurylenko) relax in different rooms of a luxury hotel. Alex is seen changing her eye and hair color. She goes to her partner's room and it becomes apparent that they are ex-lovers with Alex being mad with him and him wanting to reconcile. The man says he found ""some even better insurance"" in with the diamonds and wants Alex to help him with it but is disturbed by a knock on the door. He -- now identified as ""Kev"" or ""Kevin Fuller"" (Colin Moss)"" -- is expecting a woman who will the original insurance. She (Jessica) is indeed at the door but followed by some gunmen -- actually three men and one woman. Alex hides under the bed, but Kev and Jessica are subdued. Jessica gives up her cell phone with a sex video and is promptly shot in the head. The leader then demands Kevin give over a USB drive, after badly torturing home they kill Kevin, Alex is quiet and unnoticed under the bed. The head ""bad guy"", Mr. Washington (James Purefoy) is annoyed that Kevin has died prematurely. Alex sneaks out from under the bed and finds a gun but it turns out to be unloaded. An extended chase and running gun battle ensues but in the end, Alex escapes from the hotel.There's a chase scene on the city streets with the bad guys temporarily joined by the police when she runs a red light. However she escapes everyone.Alex shows up at ""blue light""''s apartment and he confidently prepares to defend his place but has underestimated his opponents and is quickly killed. In the other room, Alex calls Kev's wife and warns her to get out of town immediately. She also ask her to bring the package containing the diamonds and disk, which she suspects Kevin has stashed at home in his ""bug-out bag"". Kev's wife insults Alex because she knew of the affair Kev and Alex were having, and refuses to bring the package, if any, however, she reluctantly prepares to leave. Alex hides in a ceiling space and overhears Mr. Washington's plan to kill Kevin's wife and child. He learns of their address by tricking the young boy over the phone.At the Fuller home, Penny Fuller retrieves Kev's bug-out bag from the ceiling of the garage, inadvertently breaking the windshield of her car in the process. We see her look down at the windshield fragments, thoughtfully.Three bad guys race to Kevin Fuller's home while the other group are cleaning up the bodies left behind at the hotel. Alex also gets to the house and another big fight happens in which both baddies are killed (Mr. Washington had already left for the hotel with the bug-out bag). Alex is given the disk by Mrs. Fuller (which leaves us wondering just what was in the bug-out bag) but when she attempts to view the disk on the home computer, it activates a GPS device telling ""someone"" her location, so she immediately leaves along with Mrs. Fuller and the boy.Mr. Washington receives a phone call from the senator asking about the drive and is annoyed when the senator says he is sending his right-hand man, Doug MacArthur (Karl Thaning) to provide assistance. Mr. Washington is annoyed at this but polite to the senator while on the phone with him.As the cleanup at the hotel is taking place, Washington receives a call from Alex and is tricked into revealing that they are at the hotel. She races to the hotel on a stolen motorbike and then follows him to some abandoned industrial building. Washington has with him two associates, Ms. Clinton (who he thinks well of) and Mr. Jefferson who both he and Clinton think is an idiot. Alex sneaks in and subdues Mr. Jefferson and holds him hostage by holding him with a gun in his mouth. Alex calls Washington and it now is explicitly stated that both the robbers and Mr. Washington's crew were hired by the senator. The robbers weren't told about the drive, only the diamonds, and Washington knew about both and was assigned to kill the robbers. She then deliberately makes Washington and Clinton aware of her presence and attempts to trade Mr. Jefferson for the diamonds (even though she already has the diamonds and the drive). When Washington refuses, she shoots Jefferson through the head. She also activates a bomb she has hidden in Mr. Washington's SUV, but fails to seriously harm him or Clinton. Alex has hidden but again makes her whereabouts known. She gets captured when a third member of Washington's crew appears. She's placed in a chair with her leg in a vice and there is a long torture scene. Washington figures out she was a CIA ""entry-specialist"" who quit after a job in Beirut went wrong and innocent people were killed. Washington also discovers that the ""diamonds"" he thought he had were actually just shards of a broken windshield. Alex had placed them in a bag earlier and he hadn 't bothered to look in the bag until later. Alex fagrees to make a trade for the diamonds and drive at 9 PM that night at Cape Town airport. she calls Penny Fuller to confirm the meet.That evening at the airport, what's left of Washington and Clinton show up along with Alexis, in a short black dress, heels and a cane. Penny is there is a dark wig, keeping incognito. Alex is handed a key to a locker at the airport (Penny hands it to her as she walks by). Penny then lingers around the airport with the bug-out bag, which is dripping a bit of blood .Washington is very suspicious of Alex and insists she open the locker and then the box. However, she has tricked him by placing both items in an inner compartment in the box and when this is opened by Ms. Clinton, a bomb goes off. Clinton is seriously wounded in the face but still able to fight. Meanwhile, the third member of the crew has spotted and captured Penny. The airport police are now involved. Clinton defeats a squad of them in hand-to-hand combat but is finally shot. Washington and Alex fight and she wrestles away from him the drive- which Penny had hid in his necktie, earlier. She stuns Washington with a blow to the face and runs toward the terminal door. Washington kills a policeman who gets in his way. All this time, the third baddie has been carrying a subdued Penny through the chaos of the terminal. Alex gets to him and puts a bullet through his head. She runs towards the exit. Washington is surrounded by police just outside the terminal. He stops and raises his hands. Penny pulls off her wig changes her appearance quickly, and tries to exit the terminal. Alex comes out and talks to Washington. She makes a chess comment, ""Queen to Bishop 5"" then yells out ""gun"" and dives off. The police open fire and Washington goes down in a hail of bullets. Penny Fuller is held as a witness at first, on the scene, along with all the others, but released when the lead detectives attention is diverted elsewhere. He is shown a bag left on the scene which contains a woman's head, Jessica's. The head has been given a fresh wound to the face because Alex had received such a wound when she was shot at the bank by violet lights. A few diamonds were left on the scene also, however it is revealed that Penny has the bulk of the diamonds in her bag. She leaves to go to her mother's to pick up Matthew, her son. A Squad of Interpol police arrive along with Mr. MacArthur, and take control of everything, but it is too late, Alex gets past security with a fake passport and is on an outbound flight. She has a new tech associate with her and they view the video on the disk. It is of building plans with large bombs in the basement. She calls Washington's cell, McArthur answers and she lets him know she knows the plans.In the closing scenes, the senator and McArthur discuss the situation. The senator wonders whether she is going to be ""greedy or a martyr"". McArthur indicates that she will be a martyr (be a hero) . The senator mutters that martyrs must die."

Area 51,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1519461/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three young conspiracy theorists attempt to uncover the mysteries of Area 51, the government's secret location rumored to have hosted encounters with alien beings. What they find at this hidden facility exposes unimaginable secrets. Obsessed with breaking into the U.S. Air Force highly classified facility known only as Area 51, three young friends and zealous conspiracy theorists--Reid, Darrin and Ben--travel to Las Vegas. Equipped with state-of-the-art gear, they team up with Jelena, the daughter of the secret installation's former employee, and summon up the courage to sneak into the facility, intent on unearthing its otherworldly mysteries. There, in the bowels of the heavily guarded compound, terrifying truths and unfathomable knowledge await, and only the audacious UFO investigators' raw footage can prove their existence. However, can they make it back in one piece to share it with the world?—Nick Riganas Two reporters, along with their respective photographer and filmographer, are invited to Area 51 by the Air Force, to try and dispel the rumors of top secret alien research. The attempt to mislead the public doesn't go at all as planned.
In a series of interviews conducted by friends, family and experts, discuss the sudden disappearance of Reid, Darren and Ben, three best friends who are also conspiracy theorists. Reid, who is the leader of the pack, is noted by his sister and colleagues for changing his behavior and lifestyle; in the three months leading up to his disappearance, Reid becomes obsessed with UFOs, extraterrestrial encounters and Area 51. This obsession leads him to losing his job and distancing himself from his family.Next, a shaky camcorder records Reid, Darren and Ben driving to a house party. At the party, they have lots of fun, but when Reid is dared into performing karaoke, he disappears after a brief blackout occurs. Thinking he just took off, Darren and Ben continue partying without him. On their way home, the two of them encounter Reid standing in the middle of the road. Despite appearing dazed and quietsome, Reid says he's fine. The film then forwards three months later to where Reid, Darren and Ben are seen packing for a trip to Area 51, which they plan to break into. They have extensive equipment to help them break in including a machine that knocks out cellphone signals, night vision goggles and pills to mask their ammonia levels since the base has ammonia detectors.The group travels to Las Vegas, where they meet Reid's friend, Jelena, another conspiracy theorist. Jelena reveals her father was an employee at Area 51, but was terminated from his job for ""asking too many questions"". Upon his death, he made Jelena hide all his secret files regarding the base before authorities could seize them. While reviewing her father's documents in a storage locker, Jelena explains the true Area 51 base is in fact a mile below ground. She also mentions that her father was particularly interested in a top-secret section only known as ""S4"". They uncover a photograph of an elderly man, who Jelena claims her father was constantly following.Reid and the guys agree the elderly man must be of great value to the base and as such, must have very high security clearance. To track him down, the trio park at the JANET terminal of McCarran International Airport, wherein Reid mentions its rumored meaning, ""Just Another Non Existent Terminal"". Watching passengers disembark from unmarked Boeing 737's, they spot the elderly man leaving the terminal in his car much to their amazement. They follow him to his home out in the suburbs and wait for nightfall. A few hours later, they watch the elderly man drive off. Reid uses the opportunity to sneak into his home via the garage door. Darren chases after him while Ben waits in the car.While searching the premises, their efforts are halted when Ben warns them on radio that the elderly man is back. Reid and Darren hide in the house while the elderly man and his family settle in. When the family goes to sleep, Reid and Darren tiptoe around the home in order to obtain the elderly man's ID badge and a bottle of his cologne in order to obtain a fingerprint for potential bio-metric scanners. The trio escape just in time just as the house lights suddenly turn on.Reid, Darren and Ben drive out to Rachel, Nevada. They interview various locals who all claim the base does house extraterrestrial beings who appear ""terrifying"" and ""should not be let out"". While on a drive to the edge of the base, they meet a local guide who reveals there are motion sensors around the base. He and Reid explain that if they were to sneak into the base, they would have to first locate the sensor and jam its signal before it changes frequency. While walking around the perimeter, the guide notes the exterior security defenses nearby, including various cameras and the camo men watching them. Just then, an unmarked SUV pulls up and a man exits insisting he's a tourist. He asks them what they're doing and quickly departs.Later that night, Reid, Darren and Ben meet Jelena at their motel room, who wants to accompany them to Area 51. Despite some hesitation from Darren, the group agrees. Reid has Jelena take some pills to mask her ammonia levels while testing a jumpsuit that has been pumped with freon to mask her body temperature. Ben spots someone peaking inside his car outside. The door is suddenly banged on, but when they answer, nobody is outside. As Darren, Reid and Jelena prepare to go, Ben refuses to drive them. He demands Reid to explain why he is doing this. Reid explains he's experienced odd events involving missing time and that ""something is pulling him towards the base"". Seeing no other option, he insists he must do this. Ben then drives them out to the desert. They go over the plan before departing: Ben will wait in the car while Reid, Darren and Jelena sneak onto the base, obtain evidence of extraterrestrials before heading back.Reid, Darren and Jelena begin their trek into the desert wearing gas masks, their Freon-laced jumpsuits and small camcorders. Along the way, they encounter another motion sensor which Reid disarms before it changes frequency. They narrowly avoid detection from a helicopter doing a lookout. After further trekking, they reach the base. They jump a perimeter fence, run onto the tarmac and hide in a hangar from armed soldiers.Using the stolen ID badge and fingerprint, they gain entry to a staircase which takes them into the base's underground complexes. The trio carefully maneuver through long corridors, offices and additional staircases as they sneak past office workers and troops. They hide in a locker room where they find a bulletproof vest that has been partially melted and a walkie-talkie. They hear a mysterious, terrifying shriek on the walkie-talkie before they depart again. They arrive at the S2 Complex, where they find a mysterious green, bubbling liquid encased in large tubes, as well as large holding cells and a laboratory. They witness a soldier enter an armed vault. Using their thermal camera, they manage to enter the password (Darren deduces that the last numbers pressed will be the warmest) for the vault and get inside.Inside the laboratory, they discover anti-gravity devices and large containers of white blood. When Darren and Jelena touch the outside of the container, the white blood boils. The blood, appearing sentient, tries to attack them. When this happens, the lab shakes and various instruments and beakers break, including the anti-gravity device which smashes out of its confinement.Reid and Jelena flee the lab while Darren steals a beaker of white blood. The trio descend further down into the base. They wander through various industrial sections of the vault until they come across another large hangar housing a black-colored, saucer-shaped craft. Upon examining it, Reid touches the craft's structure and is stunned when it dissipates, as if it were opening. Jelena tries to do the same, but nothing happens. Reid climbs up a staircase overlooking the craft. When he notices a square-shaped hole in the top of the saucer, he jumps inside. When he does, the hole vanishes. Inside the craft, Reid finds a number of oval-shaped, white pods and a long-thin seat. He remarks how the interior of the craft is transparent, as he can see Darren and Jelena outside, but they can't see him. Reid then exits the saucer-shaped craft.Finally, the trio make it to S4. They walk into another hangar of sorts, but at the far end lies a tall, wired fence and gate. Reid uses the ID badge and fingerprint to open the gate. The gate opens, but it quickly closes before they can enter. Jelena notes it may be a security protocol. They attempt to re-open the gate, but when they do, alarms and sirens go off, declaring a security breach. Reid and Jelena run past the gate before it closes, separating themselves from Darren. Armed troops appear and Darren flees. On the other side of the gate, Reid and Jelena find a large metal door. The door slowly opens, revealing a compound containing grey alien beings. Jelena panics, but Reid touches them and notes they're made of rubber, as if they were spacesuits for the extraterrestrials.They walk further into the compound and find another large door in front of them. The metal door they entered from closes and the secondary door opens. Past the second door, they discover a cave system. They wander slowly through the main tunnel. As they descend further in, they find small rooms, one containing a large pile of clothes, another containing random items (glasses, etc.) and another full of toys and stuffed animals. Jelena picks up a doll and notes how she had the same doll as a child.Reid tiptoes into another room and discovers a large number of oval-shaped white pods. He fears there may be an entire colony of aliens in the cave. Jelena points out one of the pods is open and insist they leave. Suddenly, a grey alien emerges from the opened pod. Reid and Jelena run through the cave and hide. They make it back to the compound and close the metal door before the alien reaches them. When the outward door opens, they appear to be in another section entirely. They find a large pipe and with no other option, use that to exit. Meanwhile, Darren is hiding in one of the hallways of the base as the alarms continue going off. He watches people being evacuated by troops. He looks down a hallway and spots an alien being's shadow. A soldier spots him and chases him into a lounge. Darren tries to warn the soldier about the alien, but it's too late; the alien attacks the soldier. Darren flees into a cafeteria next door and hides under a table. The alien destroys the cafeteria and immediately spots Darren. Darren flees into a back room and escapes by using a small elevator.Meanwhile, Reid and Jelena continue crawling through the pipe. They hear strange noises and spot an alien moving quickly below them. Jelena falls down a shaft and so does Reid. They find themselves in a large room completely colored white. Reid and Jelena run through various corridors. They find mysterious flesh-like material and strange, indecipherable symbols. Jelena is nearly attacked by an alien and the two run away. As Reid tries to find a way out, Jelena is dragged by an unseen force. When Reid discovers she's gone, he panics and runs down more corridors searching for her. He finds her in another white room, but she appears completely entranced. The gravity in the room disappears and the two of them start floating freely. Reid panics and watches his camcorder escape through a small shaft. As it falls, the camcorder reveals the shaft to be part of a large, silver, disc-shaped craft ascending into the sky.Darren manages to leave the base undetected, blending in with the rest of the Area 51 staff. While they are placed on trucks, he jumps the fence and runs into the desert back to the car. He finds Ben, who asks where Reid and Jelena are. Darren tells them they got separated, but they must leave now because ""they're after him"". Ben starts the car, but it suddenly loses power. Darren complains, but Ben says he's not doing anything. Ben then looks up and spots something. Darren looks up too and runs outside the car. Ben tells him to get inside, but Darren is suddenly pulled upward by an unseen force. Ben tries to cling onto the seat, but this fails and he's dragged upward also, presumably into the same craft containing Reid, Jelena and now Darren. The camera then cuts to black.In a post-credits scene, an old man finds Reid's camcorder which escaped the craft departing the base."

Demonic,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1841642/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A police officer and a psychologist investigate the deaths of five people who were killed while trying to summon ghosts. In Louisiana,Detective Mark Lewis is summoned to attend a call from the notorious Livingston House and he finds three bodies and one survivor, John, who is in shock. He calls for backup and also the police psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Klein to interrogate John. They learn that the team of ghost-busters Bryan, John's pregnant girlfriend Michelle, Jules, Donnie and Sam decided to perform a séance in the house, where the owner Marta Livingstone had committed a violent slaughter, to summon their spirits. The séance went wrong and released evil spirits that killed Jules, Donnie and Sam; however Michelle and Bryan are missing. While Elizabeth interrogates John, Mark and the technical team tries to retrieve the hard disks with the footage's from the house to find where the other two survivors may be, Detective Lewis discloses a dark supernatural secret about John.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Called in to investigate the messy crime scene at Louisiana's blood-stained Livingston house, the police detective, Mark Lewis, discovers three brutally murdered college students, and the amnesiac survivor, John. As the experienced crime psychologist, Dr Elizabeth Klein, tries to get to the bottom of this intricate puzzle, it appears that two more of John's companions have gone missing after a botched attempt to communicate with the spirits of the dead, during a dark séance. Could John's friends be dead already?—Nick Riganas (Note: portions of this synopsis are told in chronological order to eliminate confusion)In the opening credits the audience is told the story of a group of teenagers whom performed a satanic ritual in a rural Louisiana home in the 1980s - causing one of the teens to murder the four others and then commit suicide.In the present day an elderly man is sent to investigate the long abandoned home after his wife claims to have heard strange noises coming from the property. After he does so he calls the police and Detective Mark Lewis is dispatched to the scene despite his plans that evening to have wine and dinner with his girlfriend police psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Klein.Entering the house, Lewis discovers the dead bodies of three individuals - brutally murdered with an axe - and discovers a fourth in the upstairs bedroom who turns out to be still alive. Taking the survivor from the scene, the young man (named John) begins to recount the occurrences leading up to the murders. As Lewis launches a homicide investigation he calls in Elizabeth to handle John's interrogation - unsure if he's a victim or the suspect.John recounts events from a week earlier when he was interviewed by his girlfriend Michelle and her brother Sam regarding visions he was having of his deceased mother sitting in a house he didn't recognize telling him to ""let go"". Michelle and Sam, as it turns out, are a part of a amateur ghost-hunting team consisting of themselves and three others: Paul (Michelle's jealous ex-boyfriend and leader of the group), Jules (the team's expert on spirits and occult knowledge), and Donnie (a quiet tech guy). Michelle and Sam insist that if they can investigate the location within which John's mother appears in these visions he can gain some closure, sleep better, and stop having them altogether.Days later when the team deduces that the house in John's visions is none other than the same one that the satanic murders took place in the 1980s, the group heads off to investigate - John reluctantly coming along. Tensions are high between Paul and John during the ride there and when the team begins to set up all their equipment. As strange occurrences begin to happen, John somehow reveals the location of a large circular design hidden under a rug. This design turns out to be the seal that was used in the ritual performed in the '80s, used to summon and communicate with the spirit world.Later on when a painting suddenly bursts into flames John runs to fetch a fire extinguisher from a nearby closet and puts out the blaze. The team realize once again John inexplicably knew where something was and tests his knowledge of the home - John somehow knowing the location of a drawing of a girl underneath some wallpaper and an image of the seal imprinted on the back of a photograph. Jules is suddenly pulled across the house by an invisible force and when the group recovers her John insists that they must leave the house before something worse happens. Both Paul and Jules rebuff this, explaining that this kind of evidence is what they've been searching for as ghost-hunters and recording/sharing it would not only be ground-breaking but would legitimize their choice of work.A distressed John continues to try and convince Michelle to leave but the two are approached by Paul who reveals that he discovered that John's mother was not only present in the house the night of the murders in the '80s but she was also the only survivor of that night. Paul explains that if they stay and perform the seance then perhaps John can communicate with his mother and figure out what she's trying to tell him - putting her soul to rest.The group uses the seal to perform the seance and as an increasing number of paranormal things begin to occur around them Jules repeatedly reminds everyone to not ""break the circle"" by releasing the hands of those on either side of them. During the chaos and confusion, Michelle begins to experience severe pain and John sees his mother next to him - telling him to let go. When John lets go and breaks the circle to aid Michelle things turn for the worst and the group scrambles away in different directions - John eventually coming across Paul who's standing in front of a painting repeating over and over that he must kill everyone in the house. Paul attacks John, who manages to escape, and Paul disappears into the darkness.Back in the present, Dr. Klein continues to grill John about what happened in the house - uncovering that Michelle is ten weeks pregnant - while Detective Lewis tries to piece together events from physical evidence and what they can find on corrupted video recordings. Eventually, Lewis deduces that the three dead bodies belong to Sam, Jules, and Donnie and that Michelle and Paul are nowhere to be found. Given the information that John has provided up to this point, Paul appears to be the killer and he may have fled the house in pursuit of Michelle. When a stolen vehicle report comes in from nearby, Lewis puts in APB out on the car which is soon found, crashed, not far away.When police officers approach the overturned vehicle they find a badly injured but alive Paul but no Michelle. Paul suddenly awakens and injures one of the officers, takes his gun, and flees into the woods - eventually making it to a convenience store where he assaults the cashier and quickly becomes cornered by the police.Lewis goes to confront Paul at the store and has his officers slide a walkie-talkie through the door - hoping to negotiate. When John hears what's happening over Dr. Klein's radio he grabs it and begins yelling and threatening Paul - demanding to know where Michelle is. When he hears John's voice Paul picks up the walkie-talkie and begins screaming into it over and over. On the other end, John flies backwards and begins to have convulsions as he goes into cardiac arrest - the convulsions getting worse each time Paul screams into the walkie-talkie. Dr. Klein pleads with Lewis to do something to stop this and the detective fires three rounds into Paul's chest.As Lewis leans over a dying Paul he asks him where Michelle is to which Paul responds by grabbing the cross necklace around Lewis' neck before succumbing to his wounds. One of the other officers then points out that the reason Paul wasn't communicating with anyone was because he had had his tongue removed.Returning to the house, Lewis enters the bedroom where he first discovered John and goes into the walk-in closet which held a box of crucifixes he had noticed before. Exploring the closet, Lewis finds a small hidden door into the interior of the house where he finds a bound and gagged Michelle. As she's being helped away by paramedics she repeats ""same room"" over and over to Lewis.Between interviews with John, Dr. Klein conducts research of her own and discovers that the seal used in both the past and present seances is called the ""Seal of the Left Hand Path"" and is intended to release a demon from its prison by possessing someone involved in the seance, murdering the others, and then committing suicide before transferring to a ""pure vessel"" and being reborn into our world.When Dr. Klein's attention is brought to footage just un-corrupted from the house she sees that it was in fact John who was standing in front of the painting repeating that everyone had to die, not Paul, and further footage shows him attacking Paul and removing his tongue before murdering Jules, Donnie, and Sam.Dr. Klein goes to confront ""John"" with this revelation who tells her it's too late and that he will be free before an invisible force begins to choke her. Lewis suddenly enters the room, having found the real John's dead body in the same room where he found Michelle - having committed suicide by hanging. As Dr. Klein is released by her attacker, ""John"" disappears into thin air as Michelle is moved across the seal on the floor of the house. Dr. Klein frantically views the footage from the camera which had been recording her interviews to find that ""John"" doesn't appear anywhere on the recording.As Michelle is transported away in an ambulance she tells the paramedic that she felt a kick from her baby. The paramedic checks to make sure that the child is alive and healthy and confirms as much. The film ends with the now demon-possessed child moving around in Michelle's womb..."

A Girl Like Her,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2523832/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jessica Burns enlists the help of her best friend, Brian, in order to document the relentless harassment she's received from her former friend, Avery Keller, one of South Brookdale High School's most popular students. 16 year old Jessica Burns has a secret that she's afraid to share with anyone - except her best friend, Brian Slater. For the past year she's been victimized by another girl - her former friend, Avery Keller, one of South Brookdale High School's most popular and beautiful students. What can you do when the world sees the image of a person but not the reality? With Brian's help and a hidden digital camera, the evidence of Avery's relentless harassment is captured and finally exposed-bringing both girls and their families face to face with the truth.—Radish Creative Group A very powerful story exposing the reality of bullying from both sides. Shows the potential harm that can be done, but explains how it can start. A must watch for anyone being bullied or even a person bullying someone else. Jessica (Lexi Ainsworth), a 15-year-old sophomore in high school, attempts suicide by taking a handful of pills from her mother's medicine cabinet. Her mother soon finds her unconscious, and Jessica is rushed to a hospital. It is also mentioned that the high school she goes to has won a chance for a documentary film, led by filmmaker Amy Gallagher (Amy S. Weber), for being the only public school to place as one of the top ten schools across the country.Word of Jessica's suicide attempt and hospitalization spreads quickly throughout the school, and the cameras catch students crying and talking about the situation. Miss Gallagher and her camera crew go around interviewing kids about Jessica, and they reveal that her main tormentor was her former best friend, Avery Keller (Hunter King). According to Jessica's best friend Brian (Jimmy Bennett), Jessica first fell out with Avery for not wanting Avery to cheat off of her test in a class when they were in junior high school, and Avery had been relentlessly bullying Jessica since - none of the other students in school seemed to be aware of these details, but had noticed subtle tension between the two.When confronted about it, Avery casually denies ever bullying Jessica, and claims they simply drifted apart after transitioning from middle to high school. As a response to the rumors, Avery agrees to record footage of her daily life to demonstrate the pressures of being popular. Though Avery herself is desensitized to it, her own video footage demonstrates that she comes from a dysfunctional family; Avery's mother is a shrewd and domineering woman who never has the time of day for her, while her father is an unemployed loser who does nothing, and Avery's older brother is a slacker who dropped out of college and does nothing either. During all of this, Avery's peers/minions tend to feel intimidated by her teasing and controlling nature (for example, Avery and her clique restrict other girls from using a specific public restroom while they apply their makeup).Brian eventually confesses to Miss Gallagher and the camera crew that six months ago, he and Jessica agreed to film Avery's bullying with a hidden camera disguised as a dragonfly pin. He invites them into his home to show them the footage, which documents Avery's constant physical harassment and threats toward Jessica, particularly cruel punishment for walking into Avery's favored public restroom, and Avery's floods of text messages and emails telling Jessica to kill herself. The footage also shows Jessica crying alone in a school hallway when Brian finds her. Jessica strongly suggests to Brian that she's having suicidal thoughts, and Brian tries in vain to console her and convince her to show their hidden camera footage to the school faculty. Jessica makes Brian promise not to show anyone else the footage, out of public embarrassment and fear of worse bullying from Avery.... a promise Brian broke by showing their footage to the camera crew. Brian also confesses to Jessica's mother (while waiting by Jessica's bedside in the hospital) that he had been withholding the footage - though she is noticeably upset, she reassures Brian that he shouldn't blame himself.The students at school grow further convinced that Avery had been bullying Jessica, causing Avery and the rest of her clique to turn on each other. The other clique members join forces to tell the school principal that rumors of Avery's bullying are true, which prompts a conference between Avery, her parents and the principal. However, Avery's dysfunctional parents are in denial and staunchly defend her, but Avery storms out in frustration and posts an insensitive video rant about Jessica's suicide on social media for all the other students to see. Miss Gallagher and the camera crew approaches Avery again in the school hallway, advising her to remove her social media post and telling her they have proof that she bullied Jessica. They ask her if she wants to see it, and she agrees to meet them at her house that night.Later that night at the hospital, Jessica's parents are visiting her when she loses her heartbeat. Her parents and the cameras are kicked out of the ICU, as the doctors attempt to revive Jessica. At this point, Avery is watching the footage of her bullying Jessica with Miss Gallagher. After several minutes, she starts to break down while watching and requests that it be turned off. Crying hysterically, she tells the filmmaker how sorry and regretful she is, as she comforts Avery and tells her that she is really a good person.The doctors are able to regain Jessica's pulse, but say that due to the non-improvement of her organs, she will eventually succumb to total organ failure if she doesn't wake from the coma soon.Realizing the consequences of her actions, Avery posts a blog, tearfully stating that no person deserves to be treated the way she treated Jessica and apologizes profusely. She ends the video with, ""My name is Avery Keller, and I'm a bully.""The movie ends with a cut to Jessica's face, in which she opens her eyes and looks around, before finally staring straight into the camera."

Nina Forever,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2885628/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Suicidal Rob starts dating a colleague at the supermarket. But whenever they have sex, his dead girlfriend, Nina, pops up. After his girlfriend Nina dies in a car crash, Rob unsuccessfully attempts suicide. As he begins to overcome his grief, he falls in love with a co-worker, Holly. Their relationship is complicated when Nina, unable to find rest in the afterlife, comes back to life to sarcastically torment them whenever they have sex. We open with a man splayed out on the road, seemingly dead. His motorcycle is crashed a few feet away from him, smoking and beeping. Just when it appears that the man is dead, he comes to and moves.We cut to a supermarket parking lot, where Holly (Abigail Hardingham) is discussing the accident with some of her co-workers, and the man who had it, Rob (Cian Barry), who is a fellow employee. Rob had apparently caused the accident on purpose to commit suicide, despondent over the death of girlfriend Nina (Fiona O'Shaughnessy). Holly finds his actions endearing and sweet. ""I'd love it if my boyfriend tried to kill himself because I died"", she says.Her co-workers tell her that Rob failed in his attempt though and now he is stocking shelves for minimum wage. ""Imagine being fucked by someone like that"", Holly says, equating Rob's damaged psyche with sexual prowess. Her coworkers say she is weird and that she doesn't actually want to sleep with him, she just wants to be there when he finally succeeds in killing himself. They tell her she can't save him before going back to work. As they leave, Holly hears them snicker about the fact that despite being enamored with Rob, she has yet to speak to him.That night, Holly is in a car with her boyfriend, David, who is breaking up with her. David awkwardly asks to be friends, and Holly agrees at first. David then notes that perhaps he was too dark for her. When Holly inquires what he meant, David says that he considered her vanilla due to her being so nice. He immediately tries to backpedal, telling her that isn't a bad thing. Holly tells him to go fuck himself and leaves the car, saying he knows nothing about her.The next day, Holly is at work, ringing up customers' purchases while she watches Rob stock the shelves. At one point, Rob breaks a jar and cuts his arm, screaming an obscenity. His boss asks if he is okay and he storms off to the break room.Later, Holly goes back to the stock room and sees Rob sitting on a shelf listening to music. She gets his attention and asks to see his cut, as she is a paramedic in training. She takes a look at it, and Rob goes back to listening to his music. Holly asks what he is listening to, so he offers an ear bud and she listens with him. As she listens, Rob looks at her and for the first time notices her beauty. Holly grabs a pomegranate and tears it in half for Rob and her to share. As she digs into the fruit, Rob looks at her intently.At home that night, Holly cant sleep. She gets a text from an unknown number. It says ""I really wish I'd kissed you."" Holly smiles, realizing it was Rob that sent the text, and goes back to sleep.Rob and Holly go on a date. They seem for a minute ready to kiss. Rob then asks her why she spoke to him. Everyone else at work think of him as this fragile freak that is ready to kill himself. Holly notes that he does a pretty good impression of that stereotype. Rob smirks then walks off the sidewalk near traffic. Holly tenses, thinking Rob was going to try and kill himself with an audience. However, all he was doing was taking a shortcut across the street to get to the theater they are going to. After some convincing, Holly runs across and joins him, taking his hand when she reaches safety. Rob notices her action and they both smile.The next day, Holly thinks about the night before. Rob told her he didn't want to hurt her. Holly tells him he won't.Holly goes to one her paramedic classes where the instructor briefs them about what it means to be a paramedic. Intercut with the speech is Holly trying on her outfit at home for her next date with Rob. We see her in his apartment, taking off her clothes. The instructor concludes his speech saying that distance is one of the most important things to have in their line of work, as they must understand that they will not be able to save everyone.That night at Rob's apartment, they put on some music and drink a glass of wine. As they look at each other, Rob moves to kiss her, causing Holly to spill some wine. She apologizes then breaks the glass and laughs.We see a close up of Rob's bed. A small red dot on the pillow slowly becomes larger.Rob and Holly begin to undress and they move to the bedroom where they begin to have passionate sex. We see Rob has a tattoo on his back that says Nina Forever. As they continue to have sex, blood begins to seep into the mattress and sheets around them. A bloody hand crawls out from underneath the covers. Bloody hands grab Holly's feet. She thinks they are Rob's but they have their hands clasped together. They realize something is horribly wrong.Blood continues to soak the sheets and a body forms out of the bed, startling both Holly and Rob. It is a naked Nina, broken and bloody as she was on the day her car accident took her life. Nina is less than pleased to find a naked woman in her boyfriend's bed, despite the fact that she is no longer among the living. Rob introduces them to each other, and notes Holly works with him at the supermarket.""How old is she, really?"" Nina asks as her body contorts, barely able to stand or sit up due to her injuries. Rob replies that this isn't possible, that she is dead. ""Yeah, but I kept my standards"", Nina deadpans. During this time, Holly watches with shock, unable to comprehend what is happening. She believes Nina to be a hallucination, but when she goes to touch her, Nina slaps her hard across the face. Nina says she is Rob's girlfriend, and because they didn't break up before she died, she is technically not an ex. She orders Holly to get the fuck out of her room, and she cuddles up to Rob who says he doesn't want this. But Nina sweet talks and seduces him, leading him to kiss her as Holly watches. Holly goes back into the living room to collect her clothes in disgust. As Rob goes to her, naked and covered in Nina's blood, Holly runs out of the apartment. Rob turns around to look at the bloodied bed, but Nina is gone. ""Fuck!"", Rob says.The next day, Holly is at home, trying to process what happened. She bandages a cut she got stepping on a piece of glass and looks up Nina's obituary, that says she died after losing control of her car and was pronounced dead at the scene.Holly is at her classes but cannot concentrate on her studies. She gets a text from Rob saying she doesn't have to see him again and thanks her for trying to get through his depressive fog. Her coworkers snidely ask how her relationship is going with the suicidal stock boy and asks if his dead girlfriend has come up. Holly says it was mentioned then walks off, disgusted with their callous attitude.Rob is in his apartment, wrapped up in a blanket and curled up in a ball on his couch. He gets up to look up at the bed that is still covered in blood. He laughs nervously, trying to figure out an explanation for what happened, but finding none. Somehow, some way, Nina came back. Rob then proceeds to clean up the glass and all the blood. He takes off the bloody sheets and flips the mattress to the non-bloody side. He sees the blood trail caused by Holly's wound and cleans it up with a mop. He then takes the sheets to the laundry but realizing what it would look like, he trashes them and buys new ones.At the cemetery, he checks his phone for messages from Holly, finding none. In the car, he is spoken to by a woman, who is later revealed to be Nina's mother. She asks if he has found someone else to love. She tells Rob that if he hasn't it is okay, but if he has it is also okay to move on, that they all have to move on. Unsure of his status with Holly, unable to explain what happened the night before, and not wanting to hurt a woman he considers family, Rob tells her no. Nina's mother then tends to her daughter's grave.We cut the house of Nina's parents. Rob apparently still has dinner with them often. Nina's father is a bit unnerved that he still comes around so much, but tries to be as sympathetic as possible, knowing all three of them are in pain over losing someone they all loved. Over dinner, they ask him awkward questions about restarting his schooling and his motorcycle. Later, Rob and Nina's father read over the latest chapter of the dads book and asks Rob to read it, even though Rob can tell it is terrible. He does it because he wants to feel close to Nina still. Nina's father tries to tell Rob that he can do anything he wants in his life, and not let Nina's unfortunate death keep him from living his life. At the end of the night, Rob hugs Nina's mother and tells them hell see them next week. He then texts Holly saying how sorry he is, but he still gets no response.Rob sits at his apartment, staring at his bed. Rob is at work, unable to feel. At his apartment, he looks at a picture of Nina, before turning the frame face down.Sleeping on his couch, he hears noises in his bedroom and goes to investigate. As he looks in his room, he hears a knock on the door. It is Holly. Holly asks if Nina is there. Rob says no. Holly then asks him if he wants Nina to be there. Rob tells her no. Rob thought she wanted nothing to do with him anymore after what happened, but Holly reveals she saw all his texts and decided to see him after he stopped sending them. Rob brings her inside and warms up her freezing body and they begin to make out and get naked. Rob stops, realizing that if they try to have sex again, Nina will show up. We can cope, Holly says understanding. They begin to kiss again, but Rob stops once more. Rob shows her his tattoo of Nina Forever in shame, realizing his inability to let go all this time has perhaps caused this to happen. Holly kisses his back near the tattoo to display her sympathy and understanding.In bed, Rob and Holly proceed to make love again. Blood begins to pool in the bed. Holly sees it but tells Rob to keep going. Nina's hands reach out of the bed and grab on to Holly's breasts, gripping them tightly. To take her mind off what is happening, Holly tells Rob to kiss her. As they break away, they both see Nina once more in the bed, looking at them with disdain. Holly tentatively tilts her head to Nina's and kisses her. ""You're so warm"", Nina says. Rob kisses Holly who nods, letting him know it is okay. Rob kisses Nina then proceeds to keeping have sex with Holly until he climaxes. Holly turns back to Nina, trying to pleasure her with her hands. However, Nina explains that all she feels is her injuries and that Holly shouldn't bother trying to give her pleasure. Holly says she just wants her to feel good, but Nina curtly tells her to stop.Nina then proceeds to toy with Holly, telling Rob is just using her for sex. Nina will always be in Rob's head first because of the past they shared and the sexual fantasies they experienced together. She equates Holly to an oil painting that is still wet. The very fact that Nina is dead and has no next makes her most appealing to Rob.Rob then defends Holly, saying that SHE is his girlfriend and though they don't know how to fix this situation, they will deal with it. Nina says they cant break up because she died. Rob says he breaks up with her now, only to be told that wont help him either. Rob continues to argue with her, saying she cannot expect him to be alone forever. Nina notes that he isn't. Rob tells her just because he wants to move on, doesn't mean he wont forget her and what she meant to him. What the fuck does that mean? Nina asks. Rob tells her she is impossible and turns away from her on the bed. Holly, who has been on the edge of the bed getting dressed, listens as she is basically ignored by Rob and leaves. Rob says he doesn't know what Nina wants. ""I don't want anything"", she notes as death has robbed her of human desire despite the ironic fact that she does want something; to have Rob all to herself even if life itself separates them.Holly is seen walking alone on a stretch of road. Apparently the area is where Nina died.Rob wakes up, once again in a blood soaked bed. He walks out into his living room, to find Holly on his couch, holding a cup of coffee, and smiling at him. Despite everything happening, she loves him, and cares enough to handle this strange situation together. They go and throw away the latest round of ruined sheets and buy countless sets to replace them when Nina arrives.Holly talks to Rob saying she feels she should do a memorial of some sort for Nina, to show how much she cares. At a tattoo parlor, while Holly gets a tattoo, Rob explains how he first crashed his bike and how he wanted to get scars. Nina told him that he would probably die first but she would never die. Holly asks if he got the Nina Forever tattoo after her death, but Rob admits they got it the night of his first bike accident. Rob tells Holly about Nina's love of art, and printing presses and how it mattered to her. Rob asks Holly if she is sure she wants to her so much about Nina, but Holly says it is okay.One day, as Holly and Rob have sex again, Nina appears once more. Holly pulls off the bandage of her tattoo, showing she too got Nina Forever on her back. ""What the hell Rob, you're branding them now?"" Nina asks incredulously. Rob tells her that it was actually Nina's idea, to honor her. Holly tells her that she knows what this is about; Nina is afraid to be forgotten. She tells Nina that she won't be forgotten and she can never take her place, so it is okay to pass on. Nina begins to mock Holly for being a fool. She tells her point blank that she would prefer to be in oblivion then be back like this. Her reappearances have nothing to do with wanting Rob back. She is only back due his deep rooted agony over losing her. She reiterates that she doesn't want anything.As Holly gets dressed, Nina mockingly says the least she could do for her was read a book out loud. Holly gets mad, saying she will continue to fuck Rob as much as she wants and she will read to Nina if she wants but Nina will not drive her off. Holly asks if Rob is going to say anything. Rob tells Holly he loves her, only for Nina to interject that he cannot forget her. Nina tells Holly she still doesn't get it, pointing to their now matching tattoo of Nina Forever; Nina on some level wants to be forgotten. Because she is kept in spirit so much by Rob, her parents and now Holly, it makes even more difficult to get rid of her.Holly stands in the bathroom, apparently waiting for Nina to disappear from the bedroom.Holly asks if Rob wants Nina to come back. Rob says no, as they change their sheets to a red color this time. Rob says though he doesn't want Nina back, he doesn't know how to make her stop. Rob then gets an idea, asking if Holly will meet Nina's parents. Holly looks at him weirdly, but Rob explains that Nina's parents had hoped he would meet someone new. If he can show them that he is moving on with her, perhaps Nina's spirit will accept it too and move on.Holly and Rob meet Nina's mother at the cemetery. Rob talks to her privately first. Nina's mother cries and hugs him, happy he is starting to find peace. They proceed to have an awkward dinner with Nina's parents. Things get off to a bad start when Nina's father has to leave the kitchen when he sees Holly is sitting where his daughter used to sit. Furthermore, Holly becomes enraged to find out that Rob has a Ph.D. but is squandering his potential (plus the fact she knows little about his personal life) and that he has been going to see Nina's parents every week since she died. Rob tells her that they need him lest they dissolve into grief so Holly says he can have them and angrily gets on the bus, refusing to sit with him. Holly says she felt like she didn't matter to him. Rob tells her that isn't true. He is around Nina's mother a lot because in part he is all she has left in the world. He wanted her to meet Holly because he loves her. Holly tells him to prove it.At Nina's grave, Rob and Holly make out. God, you are dark, Rob exclaims. Holly unzips his pants and they sit on the gravestone, with Holly on top and they begin to have sex, literally, on Nina's grave. Nina shows up, and slides over the gravestone, coating it in blood. She tells them that the two of them are quite rude for having sex on her grave. She cradles Rob and once again, tears into Holly as she jerks Rob off, reminding her once more than she is nothing more than a sexual surrogate to assuage his grief over losing Nina. Rob pulls away in disgust and zips up his pants. Rob asks Nina if this how she wants to say goodbye. Nina says no, though crashing through a windshield wasn't how she wanted to go either. Sometimes you don't get a choice and you never really say goodbye.Nina crawls over to Holly close and tells her that she has been coddled her entire life and that she knows nothing and is nothing. She means nothing to Rob and to Nina and that will never change. You cant even put your own trousers on, Nina cackles. ""NINA, STOP!"" Rob screams.Rob holds Nina and tells her that he is finally letting go of her, that he is saying goodbye. He is going to their apartment and getting rid of every last trace of her. Nina looks and Holly. ""I think he's going to ask you to move in with him"", Nina says mockingly. ""Do you think you can manage that Holly? Living in my house? Do you think you can eradicate every last trace of me?"" ""Yes"", Holly replies. ""I love you, Holly"", Rob says.Holly moves in with her things. Holly notes that he wont be able to see Nina's parents anymore if they are going to make Nina disappear for good. Rob says he understands, and is willing to pay that cost. They hug. They begin to clean out the apartment, taking out anything directly related to Nina. As they eat dinner, Rob discusses getting her a car. Rob says he will sell his motorcycle, as he doesn't ride it anymore and he only feels up to walking. Holly kisses him in happiness.While Rob sleeps on the couch, Holly looks in a dresser and finds a dress that Nina wore. She takes it out and places it on the bed. Turning on a light, she looks at the printing press kit, Nina had.Later in bed, Rob is asleep but Holly is still awake. She thinks she hears a noise and looks under the bed but nothing is there. She then goes to bed.In the morning, Holly brushes her teeth, only to find a bloody Nina sitting in the tub. They apparently hadn't gotten rid of everything yet. Nina says she is angry they threw out all her stuff and mocks Holly more. Holly turns the mirror away until Nina disappears, leaving behind blood in the tub.Holly looks around the apartment, trying to find other things to destroy of Nina's. Nina shows up on a chair and asks Holly why she thinks she is still hanging around. Holly looks inside a book and finds a picture of Nina and Rob. ""Fuck you, Nina"", Holly sneers as she tears the photo up and throws it in the trash. She finds more stuff to throw away of Nina's.Nina is still there, watching TV on a laptop one night with Holly as Rob sleeps. As Rob wakes up, Holly notices the blood on the sheets and takes them away. Holly decides to take more drastic measures by painting the apartment white. You missed a bit, Nina mocks. Holly throws away yet more sheets and more potential Nina reminders.Rob comes home and says he sold the motorcycle and they will deliver it. He sees all the new paint and asks why the room is white. Holly puts on Nina's dress and drives off fast, parking near where she died, unable to figure out a next move. Rob comes home and sees her in Nina's dress, asking if that is a new shirt. Holly says yes. Rob then sits in his all white apartment alone.Rob visits Nina's mother, who tells him he deserves his new relationship, while her husband listens to music loudly in another room. She thanks Rob for everything, saying she couldn't go on without his help. She reveals that the love has more or less died in her marriage but she cant find the strength to leave after 30 years. The baggage she has would negate any chance of new happiness. Nina's mother begins to cry and asks if Rob is going to leave them. Rob tells ""no, of course not.""As Rob packs bags for a trip he is taking with Holly, Holly sits under the bed, looking at something. Rob tells her come along so they can start towards their trip. Holly tells him hes driving.In the backseat, Holly digs into her fingertip with a metal printing press tile. We see the apartment, stripped bare of most things, including Nina's printing press kit. Holly presses the tile in her fingertips. They get to the bed and breakfast they are staying at, and begin to have foreplay, using the tiles to mark each others bodies. They make one spelling out the word Fuck and Rob slowly stamps the word up her legs. Holly pulls her panties down in anticipation and Rob stamps her butt check. She then pushes Rob down on all on the tiles, until a design is printed on his back.Holly tells him to scratch her and make her bleed but Rob refuses. Holly calls him a coward and goes to use the press to make a scratch. However, Nina shows up at that moment and catches her arm in the press, causing her arm to start to break, telling Holly that this is what real darkness is. Rob tells her to stop, but Nina persists. Nina says Holly won; Rob has forgotten about Nina. However, Nina has gotten under Hollys skin, so she will continue to remain. Nina tells Holly she is not ready for a relationship with someone that doesnt need saving. Rob is finally able to pull Holly away from the machine when Nina lets go and tells her he is so sorry.It is at this point that Holly reaches her breaking point, telling Rob that she cannot do this anymore; she cannot be with him if Nina will never leave them alone. Though no one asks her, Nina interjects, saying Holly assessment is accurate, and that it hasn't really worked out.Rob sits on a beach alone, heartbroken.Holly sits in an ambulance, apparently having finished her training. But she too is miserable.Nina is at a crash scene, the same place Nina was killed. She sees a woman, and for a second, she looks like Nina. The woman asks if she is hurt. Holly holds her hand, tells her yes, but they are going to get her out of the car and that everything is going to be okay. Holly is later seen in the locker room, sighing in relief at a job well done. She looks at her arm and notices several bruises. As she undresses, we see her 'Nina Forever' tattoo.Holly sits with a co-worker of hers at a bus stop, who is ecstatic at the work they did. Nina looks at him and realizes that perhaps the only way she can be free, is also to move on, completely from Rob. She takes the mans hand and kisses him.Rob sits at a restaurant and looks at his phone and sees there are no new messages.Holly goes to the guys dorm room and is about to have sex when he notices the Nina tattoo, and inquires that if she was an ex and if Holly is bi. Holly pauses for a moment, and then proceeds to take off her clothes.At the restaurant, a red stain appears on the tablecloth. Rob is met by Nina's parents and tells them he got a new job. They are ecstatic for him and Rob awkwardly thanks them. Rob then finally says that what they are doing isn't healthy, and it isn't helping them heal at all. Nina's father then explodes on Rob thinking it is all about him. He asks Rob what he thinks it was like to see him every week, to help him back on his feet, to get him a job, for him to a constant reminder that his only child is dead and he isn't. He tells Rob he cant help but look at people his age and wonder why they get to live but Nina didn't. He tells Rob he can find someone else; their child is irreplaceable. He tells Rob that he cant stand there and say they didn't help him because they did. Rob tells them he is so sorry and leaves the restaurant.Back at the dorms, Holly takes off her panties, ready to have sex with the other guy. They have sex, and as Holly looks down at the floor, Nina appears. Typical, Nina whispers, thinking Holly's plan to have sex with another person to have no link to her was foolish. Holly then tosses the guy out of her room.The next day, Rob shows up at Holly's dorm. Rob says he had to see her, since she didn't respond to his texts. Rob tells her he's better and he loves her and he wants to be with her. Holly says they can't, and shows him her bed with the bloodstains. Rob recoils in shock, realizing that Holly already had sex with someone else, and yet Nina is still haunting her.""I'm sorry"", Rob says. Holly tells Rob it was never him that was the problem it was her. Holly had romanticized Rob's tragic link with Nina, and felt that she could fix him. Yet, her whole attraction was apparently around saving a guy with a dead girlfriend, so Nina had been linked to her from the very beginning. While Rob finally found his closure and is no longer haunted, Holly apparently always will since she idealized the tragic end of their romance. ""Are you going to be okay?"" Rob asks quietly. ""Yeah"", Holly replies, not believing it herself.We see Holly strip her bed of bloody sheets and change into night clothes.We cut back to a completely heartbroken Rob, who leaves the dorms and Holly though it is clear he does not want to. Holly is now apparently doomed to spend the rest of her life alone as every time she will get intimate with a guy, Nina will appear to taunt and mock her. Since she is no longer with Rob, who could see Nina (because they are linked) Holly must suffer this haunting alone with no hope of it ever ending."

Frantically hunting through his own previous history of July 12, 1987, Peter decides it is time to return to his roots and go back to the place in which he grew up in the year of 1987, False Creek. He returns to the countryside to the home of his father, William, a retired cop, with whom he was never close with. Their interaction is one of weak familial bonds and is very cold. William shows Peter to his room, and Peter goes through his childhood belongings, discovering an old newspaper article detailing the events of a train wreck which had happened when he was a young teenager. Peter heads out to the pub where he meets up with his old friend, Barry, a hard-swearing drunk who is struggling with depressing. When Peter tries to discuss an events which had happened in July 12, 1987. Barry becomes angry and roars at him that they had promised not to talk about it. He becomes increasingly enraged when Peter brings up the topic of ghosts and orders him to stay away from him.While Peter is gone, William looks through the newspaper article that Peter left on his bed and shows a sign of hidden regret and disgust upon reading it. Peter returns to the train tracks and sees a vision of a young teenage version of himself and Barry riding off on their bicycles to see a couple making out in a car, but Peter is hesitant about viewing such a thing. They hear a train coming and rush to take their bikes off the tracks but are too late, and the train becomes derailed and crashes killing 47 passengers inside.

Duncan explains that two bikes cannot derail a train, and that he must remember what distracted him on the day his daughter died. Peter then slowly remembers that he was distracted by a toy train set in the window of a store, which reminded him of something he had completely forgotten about on the night the train derailed. He returns to the abandoned train station to find that Barry has hung himself in there and is being feasted upon by blackbirds. Barbara questions him again and is less gentle with him now as he explains he left Barry out of the confession so as not to endanger his already poor position.

The Girl King,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1254322/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"THE GIRL KING paints a portrait of the brilliant, extravagant Kristina of Sweden, queen from age six, who fights the conservative forces that are against her ideas to modernize Sweden and who have no tolerance for her awakening sexuality. An enigmatic young woman in conflict - torn between reason and passion; between her woman's body and being raised as a prince; between the ancient and modern worlds and between the brilliance of her educated mind and the conservative forces around her. Crowned Queen at the age of six, Kristina of Sweden was thrust into a labyrinth of power and tradition, where a court of austere, Lutheran men pressure her to marry and produce an heir to fulfill her destiny. She finds sanctuary and love with her lady-in-waiting, the beautiful and elegant, countess Ebba Sparre, although the Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, pressures her to pair with his son, Johan. Soon the forces around the Queen realize that Ebba is the key to controlling her, but they underestimate Kristina's brilliant mind and her drive to be free.—Triptych Media Inc. At age six in 1632 upon his death, Kristina, the only offspring of King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden, is taken from her mother to be groomed by Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna to be the rightful successor, the Chancellor's teachings largely in following Lutheranism, like her father, in the continuing battles across Europe between the Protestants and the Catholics. In reaching the age of majority, Kristina ascends to the throne a strong and strong-willed young woman, exhibiting the traits more often associated with a man. She is a popular ruler with a progressive stance, her two priorities to make the Swedish populace more enlightened through learning - she particularly enamored with the philosophies ofRené Descartes- but arguably more important to achieve peace which means coming to an agreement with the Catholic opposition, not only in Sweden but across the continent. This stance places her at odds with many of the men standing behind her, some who wish to marry her to exert that influence, while there are others who want to marry truly for love. There are also others who believe she should cozy up to the Catholics in a marriage of convenience to show a more meaningful path to peace. Complicating matters is Kristina's own attraction, specifically to Countess Ebba Sparre, who she appoints one her Ladies-in-Waiting solely to have her near. Kristina's romantic yearnings for the Countess are despite she already being betrothed to another, and Kristina realizing that one of her own duties as Queen is to sire an heir.—Huggo"

A Kind of Magic,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4789290/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Matt, the son of a prominent witch family, is expected by the Witches Council, to marry his good friend Lizzy. But when Matt meets Sara, a psychiatrist, his magic fails him and Sara discovers that she suddenly has gained magical powers. The families having known each other for generations, the Andovers, the Parises and the Tates own and operate The Elixir of Life, a juice company. They are also only three of twelve remaining members of the Witches Council, the dwindling numbers due to one form of attrition or another. Of the next generation, Matt Andover and Lizzy Paris are on the executive of the company, while Colin Tate, who has never demonstrated any warlock powers and thus has always felt the black sheep of the group, has left the company to lead a mortal life in a want to feel like he belongs. Colin leaving the company was much to the dismay of his father, Jason Tate, especially as he feels like the Andovers and Parises are making moves to consolidate their power leaving the Tates out in the cold. The latest such move is the announcement of Matt and Lizzy's engagement, the wedding to take place in one week on Halloween. In reality, the marriage, arranged largely by Matt's widowed mother Abby, was purely to protect Matt, who on his thirty-sixth birthday in a couple of months, will lose his warlock powers as is tradition if he is not married by then, although the tradition has never really been tested. Both Matt and Lizzy agree to the marriage seeing as to the small dating pool with that attrition of eligible families, that agreement despite neither Matt or Lizzy truly loving the other in that romantic sense. While Matt has largely used his powers for the small conveniences in life as well as to charm women, his dating life largely consisting of one or two dates with each woman, he makes a true connection with a woman he meets at Colin's early Halloween costume party, he only knowing her first name, Sara. Matt and Sara are up front about their dating situations - Matt being engaged in an arranged marriage, and Sara in a long distance relationship with her physicist boyfriend, Alex, the two who only see each other a few times a year - stopping them from pursuing anything with each other despite their attraction. But what happens in sharing a single kiss at the end of the party leads to Matt's powers slowly being transferred to Sara. When Matt finally learns what is happening with the help of his mother, they, with Colin's help, try to locate Sara with what little information Matt was able to glean from their short time together. In the process, some truths come to light which may affect what happens within this collective.—Huggo"

As she enters the barn, she is killed by an unknown creature.The next morning a neighbouring farmer, Adam (Jack Campbell) finds several of his sheep dead after having their throats ripped out by a creature in the night. Meanwhile, his wife Carla (Anna Lise Phillips) is working in her veterinary clinic and hears the report of the dead farmers on the radio. She snaps off the radio and sends her son Henry (Hamish Phillips) out to play. The daughter Sophie (Katie Moore) is on the roof of the vet clinic laying in a lounger talking to her boyfriend on the phone. Carla sits at her desk and picks up the overdue $435 phone bill and angrily calls her daughter Sophie, who ignores her prompting her mother to yank the cord out of the wall. Sophie storms into the clinic and argues with her mother about farm life being solitary confinement and how they should move into the city, Carla counters this by suggesting she help out around the farm or get a job to help pay the phone bill. Henry comes in to let his mother know the man is back. Carla sends the kids in the house and calls for her husband over the walkie talkie.The man turns out to be a bank manager and during the course of conversation it is revealed that their payments are in arrears and the farm is being foreclosed despite Carla's clinic being a new source of income. The snide and sarcastic bank manager tells them they can take the reduced amount of $200,000 for their barn or be forced out in 48 hours, but Adam refuses to sell as the only reason they are unprofitable is because the sheep keep being attacked and stating that they will never have to leave.

He backs away from the forest as howling begins and large shadows start to pursue him, and rushes back into the house just ahead of the dogs who try to get into the house.When he goes to get his rifle he notices that there are only two bullets and questions Carla about it who tells them that they have been going missing, although it was revealed earlier in the film to be Henry who is taking them, Carla calls the police and tells them there is a break-in while Adam trains his rifle on the door and shoots through it hitting the dog. He opens the door to see if it is dead and is attacked by it, and accidentally fires off his other round before dropping his rifle which skids out the door. Carla grabs a weapon and begins to beat the dog. A police officer arrives at the farmhouse to investigate and attempts to radio in to the police precinct. He gets out of his vehicle and as he approaches the house the pack viciously attacks him before dragging his body into the woods.

Meanwhile, another wild dog is trying to get into the closet and attack the kids but Carla stabs it with a kitchen knife and it runs off. They make an alternate plan to climb up onto the roof of the vet clinic. Adam goes first to snipe the dogs while the kids stealthily go through the interior dog run. Henry stops to collect some unused rifle shells he has hidden there. Carla has been making firebombs from flammable liquid she had in the house to throw at the dogs while the kids run across the last patch of lawn to the ladder. The leader of the pack sees Carla and runs toward her. As she runs back for the house she sees it closing in on her. She goes to the pick-up truck instead and climbs through the back window to get the tire iron and beat it. She fights it off long enough to get the truck door open. As it leaps through the window and she slams the door, closing the dog inside. She hides under the truck but is soon dragged out by the dog. As she sits at the side of the truck with the crowbar still in hand, the lead dog approaches her slowly snarling and showing his teeth.

The Admiral,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2544766/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the young republic of The Netherlands is attacked by England, France, and Germany, and the country is on the brink of civil war, only one man can lead the country's strongest weapon, the Dutch fleet: Michiel de Ruyter. When the young republic of The Netherlands is attacked by the great Kingdom of England, France, and Germany, and the country is on the brink of civil war, only one man can lead the country's strongest weapon, the Dutch fleet: Michiel de Ruyter.—Anonymous With the seventeenth century The Netherlands under attack from England and its allies, and the country on the brink of civil war, humble Naval commander Michiel de Ruyter is called upon to lead the Dutch fleet in a battle for freedom and unity.—Anonymous The Dutch Republic of Seven United Provinces is politically divided between supporters of the Estates-General (federal parliament)'s new pensioner (de facto chief minister) Cornelis de Witt and supporters of the juvenile Prince Willem III of Orange , but must pull together to to the war with maritime rival England. When legendary Admiral Maarten Tromp (Rutger Hauer) is killed in action, his haughty son Cornelis expects to succeed, but de Witt insists on Michiel de Ruyter, a low-born but brilliant Captain from Zeeland. He modernizes the Dutch fleet, signal system and tactics and defeats English King Charles II Stuart's squadrons every time, despite sabotage from Tromp and fanatical Orange supporters, even pulls off a surprise attack up the Thames. The Dutch neglected their land army, naively believing Willem, installed as Stadholder, got a true peace and third party guarantors, but Charles conspires with the French to divide The Netherlands. The mob believes Orange's propaganda and turns on de Witt, even de Ruyter's family isn't safe as alleged ""cahoots"".—KGF Vissers The movie, as the original title suggests, is about 17th century seafarer Michiel de Ruyter, a central figure in the newly founded Dutch Republic's fight against Great Britain. Although the French were also part of Britains's alliance, Germany however was NOT - first of all because Germany didn't even exist yet (founded in 1848!), so the existing description is quite faulty on that part, though it is true that the diocese of Münster which is part of modern day Germany was also an ally of the British which made minor contributions to the English effort (but certainly not sending a fleet of their own since it was and is a landlocked place which back in the period in question shared a common border with the Netherlands which is why they are referred to as the Duitsers - Dutch for Germans - in the course of the movie)
The story opens with one of the last sea battles of the First Dutch-English Naval War (1652-1654) and follows de Ruyter through the further course of his personal as well as Dutch history in the struggle of maintaining independence while at the same time trying to prevent the Republic from turning back into a Monarchy and establishing an empire of overseas colonies and trade routes.
After the end of the first Naval War we see de Ruyter in charge of upgrading the Dutch Navy, i.e. helping build new and better ships and weaponry, and also modernising it by way of new tactics and a superior system of communication (signalling) which was developed by the brother of reigning prime minister de Witt.
After a sequence of shipbuilding and training the story shifts to the second naval war with England, depicting the outnumbered Dutch taking on a more sizeable British fleet in an epic battle, testing their new communications and tactics rather successfully."

When Madison and her children attempt to leave the house, Jacob falls unconscious just beyond the front door and Haley is soon to follow. As Madison calls 911 for help and brings the children back inside she hangs up when both Jacob and Haley recover as if nothing is wrong with them.The following day, Madison calls a doctor to come to the house and run a series of tests on her kids - only finding them to be perfectly healthy. When she expresses confusion and refuses to believe that there's nothing wrong with them the doctor promises to run more tests when he returns to the lab but also suggests that the affliction could be psychosomatic.Unsatisfied with the doctor's results, Madison begins to search online for answers - coming across a single case where a scientist could not leave his laboratory for months after conducting experiments with a proton accelerator.Hamilton arrives at the house and continues to put pressure on Madison to sell her property as soon as possible. Believing that she cannot leave due to whatever is afflicting her children, she tells him to give her some more time before starting the paperwork. When Hamilton makes a reference to the fact that her finances are in dire straits, Madison claims harassment and says that she's only one month behind in her mortgage anyways. Hamilton snidely replies by saying that his company, which owns the mortgage agreement, decides how late she is and that foreclosure would not be a desirable situation to be in.After turning Hamilton away, Madison hears a knock on the front door and angrily opens it thinking that the man is refusing to leave her be - instead finding Nikolai. Nikolai greets her and tells her he came to check up on her as he hadn't seen or heard from her for some time. Madison then proceeds to give Nikolai the ""it's not you, it's me"" break-up speech - insisting that there's something she's dealing with that he can't know about and it would be better if they stopped seeing one another. Confused and heartbroken, Nikolai slowly walks away.Inside the house, a disfigured and bloody creature emerges from the dryer and crawls towards Madison who's inexplicably locked into the laundry room. Once she's finally able to force the door open, she huddles in fear with Jacob and Haley as the apparition gets closer and closer. Hearing the screams, Nikolai bursts in and sees the creature before it suddenly disappears in a bright flash of light.Her dark secret revealed, Madison tries to explain to Nikolai the paranormal events that have been plaguing them and attempts to answer his questions regarding when they happen and what kinds of things occur before, during, and afterwards. His scientific curiosity piqued and wanting to help, Nikolai resolves to stay at the home to try and figure out what's actually happening.Contacting a former colleague, Nikolai retrieves equipment to capture and study these paranormal activities while Madison and Jacob meet with his counselor who's disappointed to find that he's engaged in another fight. As the counselor and Madison talk privately, the social worker warns that if Jacob can't get control of his anger soon and continues his violent actions the possibility of keeping him out of juvenile detention is becoming less likely. She also suggests that Madison seek legal counsel as Danny's parents will likely press charges.As Nikolai, Madison, and the kids play Monopoly that night their fun is cut short when the dice begin to levitate - signalling the impending arrival of one of the apparitions. Sure enough, the man in white appears and chases the group through the house, blinking in and out of existence. At one point Madison strikes the man with a chair which breaks upon him and afterwards slams a door on his fingers and severs them - causing him to cry out in a pain before disappearing once more.The severed fingers left behind, things become more mysterious as now they know that not only can they hurt this apparition but he may not be a ghost at all.The next day Madison reviews video footage from the previous night's events while Nikolai and Jacob analyze audio recordings. When Madison zooms in on the man in white's shirt she recognizes a logo that also appears on Hamilton's business card - a logo belonging to a company named CamSET. Going back to the article about the scientist who couldn't leave his lab, she finds that he worked for CamSET and was a part of a team involved in a ""Project ECHO"". Sleuthing further, Madison not only discovers that ""Project ECHO"" was a series of experiments regarding teleportation that was shut down when they were found to be using human test subjects, but that also Nikolai was a part of the group.Confronting Nikolai about his involvement, he swears to Madison that he resigned from the project when they first started using criminals as test subjects. When Madison shows the video still of the man in white's shirt and the logo upon it, Nikolai expresses confusion and disbelief as it seemed that viable teleportation was still thirty or forty years away when he resigned.Believing that CamSET is trying to scare them off the property they desperately want, Madison resolves to fight back by killing the man in white and hopefully stopping these ""paranormal activities"" once and for all. Making a series of improvised weapons and setting traps, the group awaits the inevitable return of the ""ghost"" that night.When he eventually begins to appear, Madison hides Jacob and Haley in the basement while Nikolai attempts to distract the ""apparition"". As this occurs, Hamilton arrives at the house and relentlessly bangs on the front door. Suddenly, the door flies open and Hamilton is dragged inside by the man in white and savagely attacked. As Hamilton, mortally wounded, crawls from the house he places a call to the police before succumbing to his wounds.As Madison and Nikolai go on the offensive, they manage to wound the man in white several times but he continues to pursue them. Eventually, Nikolai is hurt but the ""ghost"" falls into a trap and he and Madison return to the house. Two police officers soon arrive and investigate - coming across Nikolai and Madison, the latter leading them into the basement to retrieve Jacob and Haley.When Nikolai realizes that the man in white is no longer stuck in the trap he appears out of thin air and slits one officer's throat with a knife before knocking Nikolai unconscious and breaking the neck of the second policeman. As the ""ghost"" approaches Madison and her children in the basement he hesitates when he sees various objects (a baseball glove, a picture, a science fair volcano, etc) strewn about.Taking advantage of this, Madison lunges at the man but he stabs her in the stomach and she falls to the ground. As Jacob approaches him he slashes the boy across the face and Madison watches as a long scar begins to form on the man in white's face. Nikolai comes to and shoots the ""ghost"" - appearing to kill him.As the group huddles around a dying Madison, Nikolai attempts to stop the bleeding from her wound but seemingly to no avail. Knowing that the man in white will be teleported back to wherever he came from she curls up next to him and disappears in a flash of light.Now in the future, we see two men escorting the man in white to be teleported back in time - one of the men explaining that this particular ""subject"" proved to be more resilient than his predecessors despite having his brain ""scrambled"". When the other asks where they got the man, he explains that he was taken prisoner after attempting to bomb CamSET's facilities in revenge for his mother's death.Madison awakens in a bright-lit room next to her older son - the man in white - as scientists sound an alarm.Back in the present, more police officers arrive and begin searching the house and recovering dead bodies. In a flash of light, Madison reappears, alive and healthy, and embraces Jacob as the film ends."

Barney Thomson (Robert Carlyle) is a sad sack of a man. He identifies himself mostly as a barber, Hendersons' Barbers in a working class neighborhood of Glasgow, Scotland, where he's worked for twenty years. More introspective than extroverted, which does not work well for the business, he has fewer and fewer customers, and as such his current boss, Wullie Henderson (Stephen McCole), son of the retired owner James Henderson (James Cosmo), who originally hired him, is moving him further and further away from the spotlight of the shop. Meanwhile, five men so far have been killed by who the general public is nicknaming the ""Body Parts Killer,"" as the murderer sends through the post body parts of the victims to the victims' loved ones. Lead investigator, Detective Inspector Holdall (Ray Winstone), assisted by Detective Inspector Callum MacPherson (Kevin Guthrie), is no closer now to discovering the Body Parts Killer's identity than when the murders started two months ago. Wanting results, Chief Superintendent McManaman (SirTom Courtenay) takes Holdall and MacPherson off the case, instead assigning it to Detective Inspector June Robertson (Ashley Jensen), an A-type personality who believes she can do no wrong, and will take credit for others doing right, which places her and Holdall at odds with each other. What were so far these two unrelated paths start to merge when Wullie tells Barney that he is giving his chair to a new barber, effectively firing him. In an ensuing altercation of sorts, Barney accidentally kills Wullie. When Wullie is reported as missing, Holdall and MacPherson are sent to investigate, and increasingly believe that Barney not only killed Wullie, whose body has not been discovered, but that he is the Body Parts Killer, both which Robertson believes are nonsense. The matter gets more complicated when Barney's self-absorbed, chain smoking and dispassionate mother, Cemolina (DameEmma Thompson), gets involved, she who would never be considered Mother of the Year.—Huggo"

She holds the revolver at Phil, asking him where the other girls are. He dares her to kill him, telling her that he's the only one that knows their whereabouts; if she kills him, she will kill them too (he informs her that there are 4 other girls in total). He also makes a deal with her: he shows her the girls, she brings him to the hospital. She goes upstairs, makes a snare, puts it around his neck and leads him to the van, forcing him to take her to the closest victim: a black girl named Nina.Eve finds Nina at the first house, but when she finishes unlocking the chain holding Nina's leg, she rushes out of the house in a hysterical fear - despite Eve's explanation that she's trying to help her. Nina trips over a water hose and falls onto a metal fence, which impales her neck and kills her.Eve makes Phil drive to the next house, where she finds Laura - the second victim - in a room chained to the ceiling. He frees her, but right then, he tells Laura that Eve is about to take her place. Laura angrily beats Eve, giving him the chance to get the snare out of his neck. Eve shoots Laura dead in self-defense and shoots his leg before he can attack her. She beats him with a wooden bar before taking him to the van. He taunts her that she caused the death of those victims (Nina, Laura, and Dylan - another victim girl who appears in the flashback footage with Eve at an amusement park. It is later revealed that Dylan is Eve's sister; she was held captive in the same basement with Eve, and she was dead). She ties him up with duct tape and drives to the next house.She gets in the house alone and finds Lea (Bianca Malinowski) - the third victim - chained in a dark room. Right then, two men - one fat and one skinny - get in the house and go upstairs, ready to rape Lea. Eve recognizes the skinny one to be the rapist that sexually attacked her before. Eve shoots both of them, killing the fat guy immediately and leaving the skinny guy bleeding to death.Lea accompanies Eve to the next location: an abandoned warehouse. They find some girls inside a locked room. They tell Eve and Lea that the kidnappers brought them there, they couldn't but wait for those men to take them away. Eve leaves Lea at the warehouse, telling her to keep an eye on the girls and call the police. When she returns to the van, she finds Phil sitting in the front seat. He distracts her when a tall guy (presumably the captor of the girls in the warehouse) sneaks behind her, then grabs her and subdues her. When she wakes up, Phil is holding her tight, telling the tall guy to shoot her leg, like she did to him before. But at that very moment, Lea appears and hits the tall guy on the head with a spanner, killing him. Eve beats Phil for tricking her. Lea then stays at the warehouse when Eve goes with Phil to the final house.She gets in the house to find no one but her boyfriend Ronnie (who also appears in the flashback footage with Eve and Dylan) sleeping on an armchair. Panic-stricken, she holds the revolver at him and interrogates him why he's there (because it's not his house), and why Phil knows his name (Phil keeps calling Ronnie's name on the way to the houses). He concocts a story that the police didn't help him to find Eve, and in the desperate attempt to look for her, he lost his job. He tries to calm her down, but she suddenly hears a noise at the closet and she takes him there. Eve spots the photos of the victim girls in a folder, but Ronnie again lies to her that on the way searching for her, he found and rescued many girls, except her. She orders him open the closet door and turn on the light. To her horror, she finds Katrina - the last victim - lying inside. Eve now realizes that her boyfriend and Phil are behind all of the kidnappings, including hers. In the van, Phil cuts the duct tape holding his hands, but before he can start the van to get away, he hears gunshots and sees the light flashing inside the house several times, suggesting that Eve shoots Ronnie dead. At that time, the police arrive at the warehouse and free all captive girls there, including Lea.Eve leaves the house, shoots the van in a frenzy of rage, before telling Phil that they will go to the ""final address"", where it turns out to be Phil's house (a flashback reveals that she asks Ronnie for Phil's address before finishing him off). Afraid that his wife and daughter may find out his true colors, he pleads with her not to go there, but this bears no fruit. She throws him in front of his house. His wife is terrified to find her husband severely beaten. She quickly brings him into the house, but before his daughter closes the door, a hand (Eve's hand) holds it open, implying that she comes back to exact her revenge on Phil. What really happened to him and his family remains unknown.The movie ends with the satisfied Eve walking away, then standing on the street, with a cold and murderous look on her bloody face."

Fishing Naked,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887746/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four young adults get into trouble in the woods by pulling pranks until they realize they are putting an alien creature at risk with all of the attention they bring. Fishing Naked is a film about four young adults being bad in the woods. They pull Bigfoot hoaxes, scare tourists, disrespect their elders, hook up and smoke dope. It is told from the small town perspective of having to deal with annoying tourists from the city. About the time they start to really get noticed, they realize there is a creature, that they have inadvertently put in harms way with all the attention they have been attracting to their rural mountain community. As their relationships fray, they hatch a half-baked plot to pull the biggest hoax yet to right their wrongs by deliberately getting caught in the act.—Zed B A comedy for the post-Twilight generation, Fishing Naked is a modern legend of pranks, romantic entanglements, and outrageous comedy. When a series of Bigfoot hoaxes get out of hand, hormones and hilarity ensue. Two fly fisherman buddies, David and Rodney (Twilight's Bronson Pelletier and TV pinup Evan Williams), simply want to drive tourists away from their idyllic fly fishing river paradise. But they stumble upon two gorgeous trust-fund chicks (Elyse Levesque from Stargate Universe and Twilight's Tinsel Korey), and the foursome takes the gags to the next level. From Sasquatch suits and YouTube pranks to a giant fake spaceship, their hoaxes start to backfire: attracting attention rather than scaring off tourists. As TV crews, the FBI, and even an extraterrestrial visitor descend upon their pristine mountain community, these four pranksters are quick to respond ... they get baked and go fishing. Flirtatious sparks ignite even as the mayhem explodes around them. Fishing Naked provides an irreverent but endearing portrayal of rural mountain communities, the plague of tourism, and the allure of native lore. The cast is rounded out by loveably stoic Grandma Ottertale (Northern Exposure's Elaine Miles) and her smirking sheriff boyfriend (Steve Reevis, Fargo). Producer/director Pete Coggan and his co-writer Paul Lee created Fishing Naked on the heels of the successful release of their first film, Woodshop, starring Jesse Ventura, Mitch Pileggi and Don S. Davis. Cast and crew were drawn to the story for its thoughtful and authentic depiction of Native Americans, avoiding melodramatic portrayals or trite nostalgia. The film's raucous vision of rural towns, mythology, the clumsy charm of young love, and the sheer joy of troublemaking emphasizes that cinema like this was meant to be fun. Striking visual effects keep the film floating in realms of pure imagination while the town's scheming locals and bumbling tourists add to the earthly chaos. With beautiful cinematic and technical polish, the film takes viewers to an enchanted place where boys meet the girls of their dreams, girls meet the boys of their dreams, and that's just the beginning of their outrageous adventure. A guy in a Bigfoot suit, a gun-toting angry businessman, a fake UFO, a real extraterrestrial, and a small-town police force that somehow wants to stir it all up. Throw in an anchorman looking for his big break, a grandma who hopes the kids just get laid, and some really good homegrown ganja, and let the chase begin. Fishing Naked is a comedy for the young and young-at-heart."

Meadowland,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3529656/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A year after their son goes missing, a couple handle the loss in varying ways, growing apart from one another and their reality. In MEADOWLAND Sarah (Wilde) and Philip (Wilson), deal with the unthinkable in the wake of their son's strange disappearance. Philip, a New York City policeman, attempts a more traditional form of healing, only to lose his moral compass. Sarah goes down an unexpected path towards acceptance as she places herself in increasingly dangerous situations. Sarah (Olivia Wilde), and Phil (Luke Wilson) are a young married couple in the New York City area. They take their young son of about 10 years old inside to a convenience store bathroom. Phil goes to get a juice from the freezer a few feet away. Mere seconds go by and he goes to talk to his son through the bathroom door, but there is no answer. Nor to his yelling through the door to his son. The gas clerk unlocks the door, and we see that the small bathroom inside the station, actually has no back wall, beyond the stalls. It simply opens to the garage where cars are repaired, and then the parking lot. The parents are quite surprised at this, as the small closed bath room inside the store, actually opens to the garage and outside. The pair frantically search for their son around the station.One year later, the couple is at a party and we can see they are not coping well with the loss of their son, who is still missing. Phil says Sarah is on lithium for mood stability, and we see her laughing hysterically while looking forlorn. Next we meet Tim (Giovanni Ribisi), Phil's brother, who is 'self-medicating' and living on their couch. He has odd ideas about life and talks a lot, and is a misfit type, compared to the clean cut couple. He is scolded by Sarah for never recalling their son's birthday. Later Tim tells Phil that Sarah can work things out on her own and does not need help.The bulk of the film then alternates between the separate day to day activities of Sarah, versus Phil, who both deal with their child's loss poorly, and alone. They don't seem to help each other or talk about it much. We see Sarah is a teacher of middle schoolers. She is disconnected from her students, not showing much emotion. She notices a younger kid, Ty Simpkins as Adam, who is throwing a tantrum on the floor while another teacher scolds him for stealing books from the library again. Adam keeps talking about elephants, and we can see he is mentally challenged in some way. Later scenes show him being picked on in gym class. Yet Sarah says little to him and blankly watches him. On several nights, she seems to wander NYC in what looks like Union Square, simply looking at young boys. It is unclear if she is looking for her son, or has bad intent or any intent at all. Finally, she starts to talk to Adam more and more, and learns his parents are uncaring in his view of things. He seems to have autism or similar.Phil meanwhile, we learn is actually a uniformed NYC police officer. He appears to aimlessly look at photos of his son on his work computer. At night, we see him attend a coping group. He befriends Pete (John Leguizamo), whose child was killed by a drunk driver, prompting vengeance fantasies from if he ever found the man again. Phil says little, though. He gets called to a disturbance of a young couple fighting in their apartment. The woman pushes and hits her boyfriend, who says she sleeps with all their friends. She then makes a pass at Phil. Phil says little in response and does not seem to be interested or doing much police work. Later he goes to the convenience store where his son was taken, appears drunk or high. We see his friends avoid him at a bar. Phil goes to a roadside grave marker of sorts for his son, and kicks it over. He is increasingly drunk. He meets Pete and gives him the address of the killer of Pete's daughter seemingly from the police files. Pete is angry and asks what kind of friend would do this. Phil says it is what Pete said he wanted.A detective meets the couple and has a lead. A man in a van was in the area at the time of the abduction, and child porn was found in his possession. They now have a suspect.Meanwhile, Sarah appears to be regressing to a childish state. She dresses in a hoodie like her students, and listens to death metal she confiscated from one of them. We see her in a bathroom self-harming with a razor, making cuts into her skin. Sarah begins following Adam's mom, who appears to turn a trick in a gas station bathroom. She has no cash and Sarah has to buy her beer for her at the store. Adam's mom denies having any children and Sarah doesn't say she is Adam's teacher. It is then implied Sarah is fired or suspended. She meets up with Tim and they smoke crack. Tim begins crying when he sees the cutting marks on her skin. This seems to be because Tim previously told Phil that Sarah can work things out on her own. Tim now sees that she clearly is falling apart.Sarah next stalks Adam's dad to a bar. He recognizes her as Adam's teacher and is openly contemptuous of his son's disability, who is adopted. Sarah comes on to him and they have vigorous, emotionless sex in his apartment. Sarah takes his keys and picks up Adam at school, claiming his dad sent her, whereas it is unclear what Adam's dad knows about this. Now we clearly see she is abducting Adam. They drive to a burger place, and Sarah is nervous that a cop is there. Adam keeps rambling about elephants and other things obliviously. The detective meanwhile has called Phil to identify a shirt in an evidence bag, taken from the suspect with the van. Phil can barely look at the shirt, and it is strongly implied this means their son was murdered by the suspect.Sarah is driving Adam to the airport she tells him, ignoring various calls and texts from concerned parties. She does answer Phil at last. She stops the car, then gets out and sobs uncontrollably at the news she hears, implicitly about her son's death. She gets back in but can barely drive. Adam is disconnected to most of this, rambling unrelatedly. He is suddenly very excited at something he sees and demands they pull over.We see a lone elephant behind a large enclosure near the road, with some circus tents in the distance. Sarah and Adam cross the fence and walk up to the elephant, both oddly in awe of the gentle animal. Sarah looks directly in the elephant's eyes, touches its forehead. Sarah's face expresses wonder and amazement at the elephant as the screen goes black."

They go to their hideout, but things go wrong and all of the squad members on the mission except Ajay are killed in an explosion, along with Javed Khan. By analyzing Javed's laptop, the baby team gets the location of terrorist trainer Wasim Khan, who was in constant touch with Javed & Bilal to plan some big explosions in India. Wasim is traced to Nepal.To collect further information from a terrorist logistics planner in Nepal, Ajay and officer Priya (Tapsee Pannu) travel to Nepal pretending to be husband and wife. Their plan to capture the terrorist Wasim Khan (Sushant Singh) goes wrong when Wasim finds out that Priya is in fact an undercover officer. Priya manages to hold Wasim and Ajay arrives to find that Priya has rendered Khan unconscious.As per the information given by Wasim, Feroz sends Ajay, Jai and Shukla (Anupam Kher) to their deep asset Ashfaq (Mikaal Zulfiqar) in Saudi Al-Dera where Bilal has meetings scheduled to discuss the funding and execution of their plans.

The Arab police authorities put the police chief Hani Mohammad (Hasan Noman) in charge of investigating the crime. He attempts to track down the murderers quickly and eventually succeeds.

Both want to make it over the mountains ahead of the storm; Brad to attend a party announcing his engagement, Lisa because she's desperate to get anywhere away from the mysterious circumstances she's trying to outrun. The blizzard catches up with them and Brad's car slams into a snowbank in the middle of the wilderness. They're forced to seek shelter at the only structure they've passed in the last 10 miles: the Rosemont Lodge. Once a vibrant year-round resort, the Rosemont Lodge has been closed for nearly 20 years. Most of it has been sealed up; only a corner of the main building is inhabited. Josephine, the lodge's owner, used to its heart and soul--her personality and cooking were assets as valuable of the hundreds of acres of pristine mountain wilderness surrounding the lodge. After a devastating family tragedy, Josephine closed the lodge; now a bitter woman in her 60's, she lives as a total recluse behind ""no trespassing"" signs all over the property. Her only companion is the lodge's sole remaining employee, Abe the caretaker, who maintains the place as best he can while hitting the bottle all day long to insulate himself from Josephine's sharp tongue. Josephine and Abe greet Brad and Lisa with shotguns, but Josephine reluctantly agrees to take them in. Over the next several days, these four people's lives are transformed. They contend with the harrowing birth of Lisa's baby, the embarrassing discovery of Lisa's past, Lisa and Brad's blossoming romance, and Lisa's struggle to keep her baby. Above all looms the growing connection between Josephine and Lisa, which Josephine believes is rooted in the tragedy of her own past. This connection gradually brings Josephine--and Rosemont--back to life and offers a glimmer of hope for the future of Lisa and her baby.—DP"

He dresses very un-dandily if there was such a term, wears a goatee to hide what could be considered a weak chin. Mandar does not attract attention because he wants to be seen as ordinary. But behind that facade is a story - of an interesting past life that has been led. His single-minded pursuit of girls, tall and short, stout or with a pout. He's funny unconventionally without meaning to be witty. His friends have lost all hope of him settling down, as they know that he doesn't plan to. And then suddenly he meets someone whom he starts liking... and falls in love with. What will happen now? Will she know about his past? Will he able to hide his Hunterrrr reputation? The story of a guy, who doesn't want to grow up! Mandar Ponkshe (Gulshan Devaiah), is an atypical youth, a sex addict and a player. In his late 30s, he is only interested in 'scoring' one night stands while his friends are all married with kids. The movie opens with one such scene where his friends tell him to get married as he is too old to screw around. In turn, Mandar explains his philosophy about sex as a purely physical act, somewhat akin to the satisfaction of the 'perfect' bowel movement. 'Its a physical need' he philosophies, whereas love is a different ball game and isn't necessary for sex.The narration now moves back several years to Mandar's early teenage years. The year is 1989, Mandar along with his cousin Dilip (Sagar Deshmukh) (nicknamed Yusuf as a tribute to the thespian) visits his village in Maharashtra where their cousin Kshitij (Vaibbhav Tatwawdi) is already waiting for them (Kshitij is outspoken and plays pranks on everyone). 15-year-old Kshitij is studying in a military school (as he is not disciplined and his parents are tired of his antics) and is mature beyond his years in his views and aspects about marriage, love and sex. By the end of their vacation Mandar realizes that he is no longer a kid. His life becomes more exotic as he starts to woo girls (He starts by hanging around the girls wing of his school and befriends the avg looking friend Jigna of the hottest girl Swetha in school. He didn't have the courage to speak to the hottie and hence landed her friend), watching adult films in seedy theaters (He is caught in a police raid and half his head is tonsured) and fantasizing about ladies.Later in the year 1995, Mandar is now grown up and is an engineering student in Pune. There also he is accompanied by his cousins Dilip and Kshitij; the latter is an army officer by now. Mandar stalks Parul (Veera Saxena) only for having sex with her. While making out in the hostel room, they are caught by the warden and Mandar gets expelled from the hostel, leading him to rent a small flat. There he meets a beautiful housewife Jyotsna (Sai Tamhankar) and sets his sights on her. The dapper Kshitij, in the meanwhile, beds a steady parade of stunning girls at Mandar's flat. In a side plot, one of Kshitij's many girlfriends has a friend Anju who is being sexually abused by her own father. Incensed on learning of this heinous act, Kshitij beats up the father and takes Anju and her kid brother away thus rescuing them. Kshitij falls in love with her and stops seeing other women. In an amusing scene, Mandar and Dilip talk about how Kshitij didn't fall for any of the pretty girls he was seeing, but fell in love with a dark complexioned plain girl. They both conclude with a racist joke that love is not only blind but color blind! Kshitij marries Anju and they eventually have a son.Getting back to Mandar's dalliance with Jyotsana, their casual flirting gradually reaches a point where they start an affair. Hers is a marriage that has petered into nothingness, given her husband has let himself go out of shape and humor. Jyotsna needing sexual satisfaction finds it in Mandar. Their furtive affair carries on for a while, Jyotsana visiting Mandar's flat from time to time, before Deepak (Nitesh Pandey) (Jyotsana's husband) finds out. Once again Mandar is forced to shift residences and finally ends up staying with Dilip. In 1996, Mandar meets Parul again in order to keep in touch with her and is left heartbroken when he finds her with another guy, Alok.After college, Mandar is shown working a full-time job but is involved in a booty call arrangement with an older married woman who goes by the name Savita Bhabhi (Hansa Singh). After years of loveless one night stands, he takes Dilip's advise and decides to meet some girls through matrimonial sites. His strategy of being honest about his past affairs upsets most potential matches who are orthodox, conservative girls. When he finally meets Tripti Gokhale (Radhika Apte), he is so smitten by her that he decides not be honest, but instead projects a holier-than-thou image. This almost backfires, as Tripti turns out to be a very open-minded girl who has no hang-ups about her own past and admits to having been in relationships before. Now stuck in a lie, Mandar has to continue projecting himself as an orthodox, colorless man. All the same, the two continue to meet and start liking each other.In due course, Kshitij is killed in an encounter with insurgents in Kashmir. Mandar again is left heartbroken from losing his cousin and friend. This incident brings Tripti close to him as she comforts him. They eventually get engaged, but Mandar is having a tough time with the idea of monogamy. He has one last encounter with Savita Bhabhi. Worse still, while on an errand to pick up a distant relative Shobha (Rachel D'Souza) (a divorcee, who was rumored to have an affair) from the airport, Mandar assumes that the person hasn't turned up and instead tries to pick up an attractive woman who turns out to be Shobha. Embarrassed and shamed, Mandar barely gets out of the situation.At this point, Tripti's ex-boyfriend Chaxx (Suraj Jagan) enters the equation. Cool, suave and charming, Chaxx is all that Mandar is not. That, and Tripti's history with Chaxx trouble him no end and make him insecure to the point where he assumes that Tripti is leaving him for Chaxx. Mandar decides to confess the truth about his sex obsession to Tripti and does so. Tripti also reveals that she got pregnant when she was with Chaxx and there was nothing between them as they have broken up. Tripti makes it clear to Mandar that Chaxx abandoned her when she needed him the most and therefore she can never take him back.

Alto,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1577040/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two girls. One gun. The Mob. Because coming out to family is hard. But coming out to ""family"" is funny. An improbable love, the mob and family non-conformity pave the way to laughter in this character-rich story that explores what happens when these worlds collide, landing us smack in the midst of two girls, one gun, and lasagna. Francesca ""Frankie"" Del Vecchio is adamant about life. Headstrong and passionate, she loves her family, her band, and her fiancé but disagrees with all of them about one thing: Mob Hit, a TV show that symbolizes the fetishizing of Mafia culture that, to Frankie, obscures all the more important aspects of the Italian-American culture she longs to feed her soul. But Frankie's abhorrence of--and her sister Heather's attraction to--Mob culture remain symbolic; that is, until Frankie opens the trunk of a rental car and finds her world turned upside down. In the days that follow, Frankie and Heather meet two people for whom the Mafia isn't a television show, it's their lives. Nicolette Bellafusco manages wedding bands and also happens to be the sophisticated daughter of Caesar ""The General"" Bellafusco, a new boss in the Mafia. What to Heather is hypnotically fascinating, is crushingly mundane for Nicolette and downright irritating to Frankie. Getting away from that world, however, is easier said than done. Not only are the Feds on Frankie, questioning her about her new Mafia friends, but Nicolette shows up at Frankie's band's next gig--and offers to manage them. In spite of Nicolette's Mafia pedigree, Frankie finds in Nicolette something that her own family, particularly her sashimi-obsessed mother, can't give her. As Frankie finds herself alienated from her fiancé and--ambivalently--growing closer to Nicolette, she also manages to cast herself as a featured player in a murder plot, wherein only she knows who is really out to whom. Caught between her planned marriage to Tony and her attraction to Nicolette, between her imagined identity and her real one, Frankie is discovering that ""choice"" is a relative term, especially when the bargaining chip is family. In the process, she learns that the most surprising discoveries often come when we least expect it, in the midst of great personal distress, federal investigations, and oh yeah, lasagna.—Mikki del Monico, Toni D'Antonio, Christian Ford, and Mark Dobies A lesbian mob comedy...enough said? Improbable love, the mob and family traditions gone awry all pave the road for laughter in this character-rich story that explores uncharted territory.

He wins the title of Mr Tamil Nadu, which gives him direct entry to the Mr India pageant. He has a crush on Diya, a leading supermodel.

To save her career, Diya decides to replace John with Lingesan, whom she had earlier met at one of her shoots, as her co-star for her next advertisement. The shooting is to take place in China at the same time when the Mr India pageant is to take place, but Lingesan agrees, sacrificing his Mr India ambitions in the process.Lingesan is given a makeover by Diya's stylist, a transgender woman Osma.

Later they prepare to go to Las Vegas, but Vinod (Punit Pathak), a deaf-mute dancer, learns that Vishnu has ulterior motives to go to Vegas, and, as a matter of fact, he had deliberately impressed Suru and friends to procure a way out for his plan to come to the US. In Las Vegas they win the qualifiers. Later Vishnu leaves the hotel with team money to meet his son Manu (Jineet Rath), whose mother, Swati (Tisca Chopra) is married to another man and has moved on in life. He talks to Manu and leaves with a contented heart.In the meantime, Vinnie gets injured due to excessive rehearsal and is replaced by Olive (Lauren Gottlieb), and Vishnu discovers this while thanking friend Gopi (Ganesh Acharya), who works in a bar-cum-hotel. At the same time, Suru is enraged when he finds Vishnu missing and tries to proceed with jam sessions all on his own, but in vain. Vishnu returns while trying to save the day for Suru from the German team as they get into a fight, later admitting he had made a 'mistake' leaving without permission although he didn't want to lose a family he had yearned to create in years, apologizes, is forgiven by Suru, and the team enters the finals. Across rehearsals, Olive gets close to Suru and a jealous Vinnie tells Suru she loves him. Although Olive has feelings for Suru, an in-person conversation with Vinnie assures Olive that Suru had that inherent charm with nothing to do about his sweetness, and she agrees to continue with the Indian Stunners after Vinnie recovers.The team enters the final, where Vinod's health worsens during a fictitious assemblage and the Indian Stunners end up making this grave mistake in the formation only to fall down, since D (Dharmesh Yelande) knew about Vinod's tuberculosis problem. Everyone has almost given up after the accident, when Vinod convenes his fault to Suru, who forgoes it and the others return to make the formation with success with Vinod at the bottom. Though they don't win the competition as the German team won the competition, they do win the hearts of millions, with Suru lending a voiceover narrative about his mother's motivational lessons on dance."

Levski,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3917044/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The movie is about the great historical figure Vasil Levski. It follows five different plot lines: his attitude towards himself; his attitude towards the religion; the relationship with his mother, Gina; the relationship with his loved one, Ana; and the plans for freeing Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire. The movie starts in 1848 and follows Vasil Levski's whole life until his hanging in 1873.—Anonymous LEVSKI is a classic tale about the life and death of the greatest Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski. The story starts in 1841, during the darkest period of the Turkish yoke. Five-year-old Levski sees Turks raping and slaughtering young women in a small church and the survival of a little baby boy, the son of a high-ranking Turkish officer. The life stories of the two boys become intertwined as they grow into young men. After his father`s death Levski enters a monastery to become a monk, but the education he receives there makes him realize how tragic the plight of his people is and understand that they are slaves of the cruel rule of an empire whose elite have lost themselves in a world of meaningless existence. He takes the decision to leave religious life and dedicates himself to the idea of liberating his beloved motherland. Levski gets trained as a legionnaire and joins the rebellion movement. Later he succeeds in setting up more than 400 revolutionary committees all over the country when one of his apostles attacks a convoy of the Turkish postal service. That leads to a series of treacherous acts and many of his followers are killed. The feeling of guilt about these deaths, the disappointment in the mentality of his people whose minds are as difficult to reach as a stone wall and the realization that perhaps he is years ahead of his time made Levski sacrifice himself and his own life in the name of the survival of the revolution by turning himself in to the Turks."

Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai. Manimekalai was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans.

Mithran captures Vicky and records all the information from him. He drugs Vicky and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against Tamizhvanan. When Siddharth learns about this, he asks Sengalvarayan to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to the hospital. The ruling party forces Sengalvarayan either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed.

They Returned,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3894340/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The return of three disappeared children create violent ripples in their small town. They Returned is a beautifully touching and unnerving story about the unexplained disappearance of three children, two boys and one girl, and their reappearance three days later in a semi-autistic state. Not even the children themselves are able to help anyone understand what happened. No clues or signs are left, other than the fact that, as we discover later, two of them were mutilated. As the police carry out their investigation, and the town slowly sinks into a deep state of suspiciousness, small community of children - classroom colleagues of the missing three - run their own parallel search. Only one person is a potential suspect: the children's own classroom teacher, recently arrived from another town. He does not help his case when he attempts to make the school psychologist understand that the children were in fact murdered.—Ivan Noel Ellos Volvieron (They Returned) starts with three children, Lucio (Lauro Veron), Lionel (Juan Ignacio Molina) and Sabrina (Valentina Sartorelli), aged about 11 years of age playing near a vast abandoned hospital in the woods in Argentina. As it gets dark, the children do not return home, and using a series of cut-aways, it appears that they remain missing for at least a full 24 hours. Then the three children are seen naked, walking zombie-like through the fields towards their homes.The parents rush out to meet their missing children who stand lifeless and seemingly unaware of their nudity as the parents hug them. Blood begins to trickle down the inside of Lucios thigh.Next, in their class, the intense middle-aged teacher, Sergio (Julio Mendez), tells the children's classmates that they must all pull together to help the kids overcome this terrible tragedy. The three returned children are brought into the class by the headmistress, and throughout almost the entire movie, they act as though oblivious to their surroundings, something that Isabel the school counsellor (Romina Pinto) attributes to selective mutism as a result of their trauma.The other parents in this small town are revealed to be overcome by fear. This is shown by them all arriving at school to collect their children, and by increasing paranoia, suspicions and hostility towards each other throughout the movie. Although for some strange reason, even on their first day back to school, the three kidnapped kids are allowed to walk to school on their own...The other children are bewildered by what has happened, but supportive towards the returned.The school counsellor is introduced as she tries to draw the three victims out of their silence, and an out-of-town Jewish federal inspector Cohen (Jorge Booth) arrives to investigate the case. As he arrives, the towns seniors; Sophia the judge (Edmee Aran), Maria the head mistress (Rosana Rossotti), mayor Rostagno (German de Goycoechea), school counsellor, and others, are together, and it appears as though there are mild tensions between them. The headmistress implores the mayor for overdue money to repair the schools dilapidated basketball hoop. The female judge, is particularly assertive and seems to have strong ideas about who is NOT guilty.The inspector starts interviewing people and it is revealed that most of the towns people are descended from Nazis, although they are all in denial about their past. The hospital is built on land formerly owned by the Himmels, and forcibly taken from them by the government. A last member of the Himmel family (Manfred Hesper), described as ""the old lunatic"", lives in a shack by the vast decaying hospital.Lucios mother Paola (Camila Cruz) lives with her father (José Veron) and son. She reveals to the inspector that she is considered the town's ""easy slut"" and that she allowed a local called Juan (Oscar Mira) to court her in the hope that he would provide for her son. When Juan got religion, she discarded him. Throughout the movie, in a series of flashbacks, she is seen with a child in a blanket, standing in a stream, presumably about to drown the baby.Lucio and Lionel are seen in the showers after a soccer game, and as the boys turn, the reaction of the other boys to their genitalia makes it clear that something is terribly wrong. A subsequent conversation between the inspector and the local police talks about the nature of their injuries, and reveals possible teeth marks.Lionel's family takes the unresponsive boy with their other kids, to the river for a day out. Nearby, one of the town children is fishing with his father. Lionel sits simply staring at the boy. The boy senses he is being watched, and despite his father's instructions to ignore Lionel, cannot but help keep turning to look at the boy, seemingly mesmerised by him.Sabrina has a birthday party, during which she remains unresponsive, and in an unsympathetic comment, one of the parents makes it clear that the girl cannot even dress herself.Lucio's mother asks to talk to the school counsellor, and it is clear that they have some history together.The three abductees are seen walking through sunny fields towards the abandoned hospital and the town children are surrounding them. There is a long scene in a room with a locked door, during which a young boy is goaded into putting his penis through a small hole in the door on the promise that he will be fellated, although no-one can tell him by whom. The boy finally agrees, and just as he puts his penis through the door, crazy Mister Himmel arrives and chases the kids off. They run away laughing, except for the three who remain on a balcony. Himmel approaches menacingly, and even strikes Lucio on the arm with a log, The kids just stare at him impassively. It is subsequently revealed that Himmel has fallen from the balcony and his death recorded and uploaded to the internet. The suggestion is made that even a 5 year old could have pushed him.One of the younger children is discovered a few days later to have drawn a picture of the man's death, before the death was publicly known. When the counsellor asks him about it, he reveals that he saw it on the internet. She questions him about a second picture he has drawn depicting a woman hanging. He reveals that the woman is the counsellor herself. She asks ""Who killed me?"" ""You"" the young boy answers.The counsellor has a conversation with Sergio, the school teacher, and he starts to talk about ancient evil in the town. She presumably reports him to the inspector and the police go to his one-room house and search it, looking in the freezer for the boys' missing parts later revealed to be their entire genitalia. There is an allusion that the school teacher fled his previous job because of something bad that happened. The teacher expands upon his belief that something is evil and out of balance in the town that needs rebalancing. The inspector becomes increasingly annoyed at the man's claims.The local padre is interviewed, and he also talks about the evil in the town. The inspector asks the padre if he has trouble with celibacy (hinting that the padre may have something to do with the sexual crime), and the formerly pleasant padre shoots back with a nasty comment about the inspector's crippled leg.Various shots show the town children watching the death video on the internet, playing sadistic games, and torturing animals. However, there is an air of innocence, as though none of the children are aware that their behaviour is bad.The inspector talks to Lucio's mother again, and she reveals that her father was an out of towner tasked with building the hospital on the confiscated land. When the hospital project went wrong, he had his equipment confiscated and was imprisoned by the townspeople led by the judge.Lucio's mother visits the counsellor, and it is clear that they were once friends. They have a conversation about an unspecified event in the past that affects Lucio, and the counsellor makes it clear that she has kept the secret. The mother reveals that Lucio reminds her of a past that she is trying to forget.All of the kids return to the hospital and go crazy, smashing the place up, cutting each other, torturing a wild dog, and generally going wild. But it is all done with anair of trance-like innocence. As they calm down, Sabrina leads them to an outside window that opens onto a basement room. She looks through, and inside are the naked and motionless bodies of herself and the two boys, both of whom are still unmutilated at that point.That evening, the town mayor is driving home. It is dark, and the streets are deserted. He sees Lucio sitting alone by a kids park. He approaches concerned, but then Lucio speaks for the first time. ""You took their lives away. You didnt just take bricks away, you took their lives away."" The mayor gets angry and defensive, and it is revealed that he took bricks from the hospital, which somehow belonged to the Nazis. [This may be metaphorical]He relents and offers the boy his hand and leads him towards his car. Lucio takes his hand, but as they near the car, Lucio pulls free and walks on ahead. The mayor collapses in the road, and Lucio disappears. A moment later, a random car comes down the road and accidentally runs the mayor over.The counsellor has another conversation with the teacher, during which he expounds his increasingly crazy-sounding opinions about the ancient evil that pervades the town.The inspector goes to the town's judge to request records about the purchase and work on the hospital. She is hostile and obstructive, clearly hiding a secret. Nevertheless she grudgingly agrees to provide the requested documents. From this point on, the townspeople are increasingly hostile towards the inspector.
A couple of townspeople are seen having a fight after a car crash, perhaps indicating the towns simmering hostility to everything, and its gradual unravelling.The judge sets up a national press conference, and in spite of her advisor's strong objections, she insists that the three returned children must be by her side.The inspector interviews the school teacher again, revealing that the teacher is a suspect. The teacher expounds further upon his theories.Sabrina's uncle is brought into the police station for stabbing his neighbour but the arresting officer confides to the inspector that it was actually Sabrina who stabbed the man. The man is covering for his niece. Whilst left alone, the uncle opens the crime folder left on the desk, and sees the mutilation done to the two boys. Both are missing their genitals and have many gouges in that area, as though somebody went crazy. The uncle is duly sickened at the sight.At the school, the children exit from the class and wait in the hall for an unknown reason with a normal babble of youthful activity. The headmistress accompanying them, glances out of the window and notices two children outside using the dangerous basketball hoop. She goes outside to warn them off, but as she passes the equipment, it immediately collapses. She comes back in, says something incomprehensible, then collapses, with the back of her skull bashed it. The basketball children come in, and they and all the other children simply wander off, seemingly oblivious to the dying woman on the floor.Julio's mother is bathing him. He is unresponsive, but she tells him how much he matters to her, she gets angry at his unresponsiveness and goes outside to seek consolation from her father. It is revealed in a flashback, that her father had sex with her, and Lucio is the product. When she returns, Julio is missing. She goes to find him and he is sitting naked in the shallow stream behind their house.She has a final flashback where it is revealed that she is seen deciding against drowning the baby - Lucio.The police discover the video of old Himmler dead from his fall, which has been filmed by one of the children and uploaded to the internet.The counsellor confronts the teacher Sergio about his apparent craziness, but the man reveals that he knows all about the town's unsavoury past and Lucio's conception. She is stunned into silence.The inspector visits the padre again, certain that the man is holding back information. The priest reveals that the whole town was disgusted by Lucio's mother. The inspector implies that the priest was moved to the town to avoid trouble elsewhere.The small child who drew the counsellor killing herself, turns up at her house and delivers a rope pre-tied in a noose. She picks it up stunned and clearly still unsettled from her conversation with Sergio.The judge holds a press conference with the three damaged children by her side. She goes on a self-righteous tirade against sex offenders, and midway through gets a nosebleed which rapidly grows to an unstoppable torrent of blood. She collapses to the floor, presumably dying, whilst the three kids wander off, followed by the town children.On the recommendation of Lucio's mother, the inspector goes looking for Juan who lives in an old caravan. The children are already there. One of them is filming everything on his phone as always. In a flashback, Juan is seen murdering Lucio, Sabrina and Lionel one after the other. He strips their bodies, takes the clothes, then leaves the basement, distraught at what he has done.Lucio enters the caravan and Juan tearfully apologises, saying ""I didnt want to hurt you."" In a flashback, Juan witnesses Lucio's mother and father sleeping together, and Juan says that the boy was ""born of evil.""
He sees Lucio sitting with his hands cupped in his lap and says ""I never touched you there"". Lucio says, ""I know. You left us. The dogs came. We were just meat"". A wild dog is seen gnawing at something.The counsellor is seen hanging herself.The detective races to interview Juan.Lucio shows tenderness to Juan. He says, ""You need to resolve this"".Juan gets into his minivan with the three children, and starts hurtling along desolate high mountain roads. They pass the inspector going the other way. Lucio tenderly strokes Juans cheeks, then presses the mans knee down, forcing him to push the gas pedal. Juan does not resist. The other two kids move close, almost tender, happy at last. The van flies off the road and tumbles hundreds of feet down the steep mountainside before bursting into flames. Sergio, the school teacher stands on the remote road, inexplicably in the right place at the right time and watches the van burn.The scene changes to show the three children, happy and normal, playing alone on a beach as sun sets.The credits roll."
The von Trapp Family: A Life of Music,2015,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4742670/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Agathe von Trapp, the eldest daughter of a well-known musical family, overcomes many obstacles to pursue her musical career and move to the United States.

While they wait for the train, she shares stories about her childhood.Agathe led a privileged life as the eldest child of Georg and Agathe von Trapp. The family lived in a beautiful villa in Austria and had many servants. But when Agathe was nine, her mother fell ill and died. Suddenly her world was turned upside down. She was angry at her father for promising that her mother would get well. In protest, Agathe vowed never to sing again. It was a vow she would keep for ten years.The family moved to Salzburg to make a fresh start. Agathe was heartbroken at leaving her playmate Sigy, grandson of the housekeeper. As she grew older she took charge of the house, the servants, and her siblings. Captain von Trapp hired a succession of nannies but Agathe found fault with each one. Then her father hired a novice nun called Maria, who was young and very attractive. Right away there were problems. Agathe didn't welcome Maria but was relieved to learn that she was only to be there for a few months. Captain von Trapp urged Agathe to get out and make friends, go to concerts, and have some fun. But Agathe wasn't interested. She was delighted when her old friend Sigy moved to Salzburg to work as an apprentice printer.Captain von Trapp hires a chauffeur, a man named Conrad who had served under him in World War I.

She spends a lot of time with Sigy, who tells her that great changes are coming to Austria. Sigy and Conrad have a similar discussion and Agathe learns that Conrad is a Nazi.The family is plunged into poverty when the bank containing Captain von Trapp's money fails. Maria asked what they will do now but her husband doesn't want to think about it.It is obvious that Sigy is in love with Agathe, but he is too shy to tell her.

Many people are leaving Salzburg but the captain won't consider it. Since the family can no longer afford servants, Maria insists they be discharged. Conrad doesn't take this well. He argues with Captain von Trapp but to no avail.The Salzburg music festival is approaching but tickets are sold out. Agathe longs to hear her singing idol, Lotte Lehman.

Lotte compliments her and Agatha leaves happy.Sigy and his group are caught and he is severely beaten, dying on the way to the hospital. Agathe is heartbroken.

She then asks them to not only participate in the music festival but to accompany her to America, where they can open for her. When Captain von Trapp learns that Agathe had a hand in this, he angrily confronts her. They quarrel and he orders her to leave. While the family is at dinner, she packs up and heads for a nearby bus stop. To her surprise she is joined by Maria. They embrace and Maria suggests they go to church and light a candle for Agathe's mother. For the first time they agree on something; that the family must sing at the festival. Since the captain has forbidden it, Maria says they must come up with a solution whereby he will think it is his idea for them to sing.Conrad pays a call on Captain von Trapp and brings him a Nazi flag.
