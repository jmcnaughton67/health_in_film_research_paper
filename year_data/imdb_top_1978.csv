Grease,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077631/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Good girl Sandy Olsson and greaser Danny Zuko fell in love over the summer. When they unexpectedly discover they're now in the same high school, will they be able to rekindle their romance? A musical about teens in love in the 1950s. It's California 1958 and greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Australian Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) are in love. They spend time at the beach, and when they go back to school, what neither of them knows is that they both now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black leather jacket-wearing greasers while Sandy hangs with the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo (Stockard Channing). When they clash at Rydell's first pep rally, Danny isn't the same Danny from the beach. They try to be like each other so they can be together.—Alex Schultz <NedSDeclassified2967> With the sun-kissed summer of 1958 nearing its end, Danny, a sweet American boy, and Sandy, a straight-laced Aussie girl, exchange vows of everlasting devotion and part ways, seemingly forever. However, an unexpected change of plans reunites the young dreamers at the bustling Rydell High for the new term; only, this year, something has changed. As once-cute Danny turns into the cocky leader of the riotous T-Birds greaser gang, having no choice but to maintain his hard-earned reputation in front of his friends and classmates, nothing can prepare him for second first impressions. Because The Pink Ladies, Rydell's high-spirited all-girl band of lipstick rebels, have planned a big surprise for the leather-clad Casanova. Is a radical transformation the only way to win Danny back?—Nick Riganas During a visit to America, Australian Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) meets Danny Zuko (John Travolta) at the beach and falls in love. She is heartbroken when summer ends and she has to return home and their last kiss on the beach is a very emotional one. But fate lends a hand - her parents decide to stay in America and she finds herself attending the same school as Danny. But Danny at school is different from Danny at the beach. He is the leader of the T-Birds, a black leather-clad gang, and has a reputation to keep up. He can't be seen to fall in love with just one chick. Sandy is upset and seeks solace with some new friends she has made - a girls' club called ""The Pink Ladies"". But her prim and proper virginal ways do not fit in and she soon finds herself almost alone. A change must be made. Does she attempt to get her man by turning him into a jock? Or must she get rid of her ""Sandra Dee"" image?—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) is a goody two-shoes from Australia, Danny Zuko (John Travolta) is the head T-Bird from Rydell High School. However, when the two meet up during the summer, they fall in love. But when the summer ends, the two think they'll never see each other again. However, they're both wrong, Sandy and her parents have moved to America and she is now attending Danny's school. When the two discover that they attend the same school, there is a lot of debate over whether they can still be together since it's uncool for Danny to be in love with a ""goody goody"" like Sandy. However, the two, against all odds, manage to stay together. Then graduation comes and Sandy is about to change in a way no one expected.—x_baby angel In 1958, during their summer vacation, Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) meet at a beach. Scenes from their holiday are shown, but then the summer ends, and Sandy and Danny say their last good-byes. Danny seems to not want to let Sandy go, but Sandy is due to return to Australia. She is upset, thinking that this is the end of their romance and that they will never see each other again. Danny tries to comfort her by telling her that ""it's not the end, it's just the beginning"".However, Sandy's family has a change of plans and does not return to Australia, but Danny is unaware of this. Sandy enrolls at Rydell High School as a foreign-exchange student, where Danny is a student, as is Sandy's new friend Frenchy (Didi Conn), a member of the schoolgirl clique ""The Pink Ladies.""Danny is the leader of the boys' gang, ""The T-Birds."" Kenickie, second-in-command of the T-Birds, encourages Danny to tell them what he did over the summer, while the Pink Ladies likewise persuade Sandy. Through ""Summer Nights"" Sandy and Danny describe their vacation, and it is made clear that Danny is exaggerating; at the time, however, neither is aware of the other's presence at the school.Encouraged by the preppy school spirit girl, Patty Simcox (Susan Buckner), Sandy joins the Rydell cheerleaders. The Pink Ladies decide to reunite Danny and Sandy, but Danny wants to protect his cool image, and his behavior towards Sandy causes her to storm off in tears. Danny stares after her for a moment, but then quickly turns back into a cool guy and goes off with his friends.Frenchy attempts to cheer Sandy up by inviting her to a sleepover at her house with the rest of the gang; Sandy comes along, but Rizzo soon gets fed up with Sandy's goody-two-shoes behavior: Sandy chokes due to the smoke from a cigarette, cannot stand the taste of wine, and is horrified at the idea of having her ears pierced and saying that her parents wouldn't be happy about it. Frenchy insists and takes her into the bathroom to pierce her ears, but Sandy suddenly falls ill and vomits at the first sight of blood. Frenchy announces to Jan (Jamie Donnelly) and Marty (Dinah Manoff) that she is dropping out of Rydell and going to beauty school, which she calls a very strategic career move. Rizzo (Stockard Channing) has had enough and lampoons Sandy, and even Frenchy joins in, singing the sarcastic ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee.""The T-Birds arrive outside Frenchy's house. Rizzo leaves the sleepover and she and Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) flirt, then Kenickie invites her into the car, and dumps the other T-Birds. Danny leaves of his own accord while Rizzo and Kenickie drive off together and the other T-Birds go for pizza. Marty, the flirtatious member of The Pink Ladies, decides to write to one of her (numerous) pen pals, while Sandy goes outside, and decides that in spite of everything, she still loves Danny, singing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"", (a poignant love song that was added for the movie and was a big hit as a single.)The scene shifts to Rizzo and Kenickie making out passionately in the back seat of his new car. They plan to take things a step further, but Kenickie's condom breaks. Rizzo, however, is unable to resist Kenickie, and they decide to have sex anyway. They are soon interrupted by Leo (Dennis Cleveland Stewart), leader of rival gang The Scorpions, who damages Kenickie's car.While at work repairing the car, the T-Birds fantasize about what it will look like when it has had a paint job, singing ""Greased Lightning"". Soon Danny gets the other T-Birds convinced that the rickety old car could actually be a ""major piece of machinery"". Later, Danny meets Sandy at the Frosty Palace, and tries to apologize for his actions. He sees that Sandy is sharing a soda with Tom Chisum (Lorenzo Lamas), a jock, and decides that if that's the sort of man she likes, he's going to join the jocks to impress her.We next see Danny's disastrous performances in basketball, wrestling, and baseball, where he keeps losing his temper. He finally finds his ideal sport in running, until the sight of Sandy distracts him, and he falls. Sandy leaves Tom Chisum to see if Danny is alright, and they are seemingly reconciled.Danny attempts to go to the Frosty Palace with Sandy so that they can be alone and not worry about ruining his image in front of his friends. They end up discovering the T-Birds and Pink Ladies are already there and Danny finds it hard to charm Sandy without looking weak in front of his friends. After everyone leaves the malt shop, Frenchy, who has been hiding her pink hair under a scarf, imagines a guardian angel to tell her what to do with her life, who turns out to be Frankie Avalon singing ""Beauty School Dropout"".Later, Danny takes Sandy to the school dance, where the TV show National Bandstand plans to broadcast live. Rizzo, now angry with Kenickie, takes the rival gang's leader, Leo, to the dance, thus enticing Kenickie to take the rival gang leader's girlfriend, Cha Cha DiGregorio (Annette Charles) who is also Danny's ex-girlfriend. The disc jockey Vince Fontaine (Edd Byrnes) is attracted to Marty and the two flirt. The dance features several well-known songs from the '50s covered by Sha Na Na. During the dance-off, Rizzo leaves in a huff, seeing Kenickie dancing with Cha Cha, and Danny and Sandy are one of the few couples still in the dance-off. But soon, Sonny pulls Sandy away from Danny, and Cha Cha starts dancing with Danny. Sandy realizes that Cha Cha was one of Danny's past girlfriends and a much better dancer. Sandy leaves the gym upset, and Danny and Cha Cha end up winning the contest. When they share their spotlight dance, three of the T-Birds run in front of the camera and moon the crowd.Later, Danny takes Sandy to a drive-in movie. Danny tries to remove the class ring he is wearing to give it to her, but in doing so he accidentally elbows Sandy in the chest. Danny gives Sandy the ring and she kisses him on the cheek, saying she realizes now he respects her. The scene cuts to Marty and Rizzo in the drive-in's restroom. Rizzo's unprotected sex with Kenickie has come back to haunt her--she tells Marty she missed a period. One of the T-Birds, Sonny (Michael Tucci), overhears Marty accidentally proclaiming to couples making out outside the restroom to make way for the ""lady with a baby"", and asks Marty what she meant so she tells him the story and the rumor spreads quickly. When Kenickie asks Rizzo why she didn't tell him about it, she lies and tells him it isn't his out of anger. He thanks her sarcastically, and leaves her standing by herself. Marty has also suffered as a result of her crush on Vince Fontaine--she reveals to Rizzo that she caught him trying to put an aspirin in her Coke.Back in the car Danny has his arm around Sandy. His hand lingers above her chest and she sees it and he starts trying to make out with her. She screams, gets out of the car, slams the door on Danny, throws back his ring (which she calls a ""piece of tin""), and leaves the drive-in. Danny laments losing Sandy again, and reveals the true extent of his feelings for her in the song ""Sandy"" he is helpless without her.The next scene is the race between Leo and Kenickie in the Los Angeles River. Kenickie asks Danny to be his second, and Marty gives Kenickie a lucky penny. She drops it, and as Kenickie bends down to pick it up, he gets knocked out when one of the T-Birds opens the car door. As a result, Danny has to race in Kenickie's place. Sandy sits on the hill watching the neck-and-neck race, which Danny manages to win. While she is happy to see Danny win, she has misgivings about her own image, reflected in the song ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)"". As the T-Birds and Pink Ladies celebrate with Danny, Frenchy spots Sandy and goes over to her. Sandy thinks that Frenchy can help her win Danny's heart, and asks to go over to her house to take advantage of Frenchy's suspect fashion skills.On the last day of school carnival, Danny arrives, wearing a letterman's sweater (earned through track) over his usual black attire. Sandy arrives wearing a black leather jacket, red peep-toe high heeled sandals, skintight black pants, off-the-shoulder top, curled hair, and smoking a cigarette abandoning her usual modest clothing. Danny finds her extremely attractive, falling at her feet, and then the two reunite, singing the upbeat ""You're the One That I Want"" (another song added for the movie, and a hit single before the movie even came out). Kenickie and Rizzo get together after Rizzo screamed from the Ferris wheel that she is not pregnant after all and the tests were negative, and everyone sings the big finale, ""We Go Together"", and Danny and Sandy fly off in Danny's car and disappear into the sky."
Superman,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An alien orphan is sent from his dying planet to Earth, where he grows up to become his adoptive home's first and greatest superhero. Just before the destruction of the planet Krypton, scientist Jor-El sends his infant son Kal-El on a spaceship to Earth. Raised by kindly farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, young Clark discovers the source of his superhuman powers and moves to Metropolis to fight evil. As Superman, he battles the villainous Lex Luthor, while, as novice reporter Clark Kent, he attempts to woo co-worker Lois Lane—Jwelch5742 Surviving the destruction of the planet Krypton, young Kal-El is sent by his father Jor-El to live among mankind on Earth. Under the parenting of Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark Kent discovers that he was born with extraordinary powers and abilities beyond imagination. Now living in Metropolis, Clark takes up a job as a reporter for the Daily Planet and starts to fall head over heals for fellow reporter Lois Lane. But then Clark is also using his powers to help the better of mankind as Superman, who the people of Metropolis start turning to for help. But in the shadows, criminal genius Lex Luthor launches a sinister plan to make himself known by detonating two missiles in different parts of the country with only Superman to oppose him. Will Superman save us? Or will Luthor's plan succeed?—Blazer346 Unable to convince the ruling council of Krypton that their world will destroy itself soon, scientist Jor-El takes drastic measures to preserve the Kryptonian race: He sends his infant son Kal-El to Earth. There, gaining great powers under Earth's yellow sun, he will become a champion of truth and justice. Raised by the Kents, an elderly farm couple, Clark Kent learns that his abilities must be used for good. The adult Clark travels to Metropolis, where he becomes a mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet...and a caped wonder whose amazing feats stun the city: Superman! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, the world's greatest criminal mind, is plotting the greatest real estate swindle of all time. Can't even the Man of Steel stop this nefarious scheme?—Gregory A. Sheets <m-sheets2@onu.edu> This movie begins on Krypton, where Superman's father sends him off to Earth as a young child. He grows up to be a perfectly normal newspaper reporter named Clark Kent. At least, he appears perfectly normal, until he transforms into Superman - flying around with his underpants over his tights, saving the day. When the evil Lex Luthor plans to take over the world, Superman is the only one who can stop him.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> Note: italicized text denotes extended scenes not from the original cut.June 1938. The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads, the shot dissolves to the real Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular ""clan"" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor-El, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. He is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government: General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves - Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders. The leader of the Council forbids Jor-El from warning the larger populace or he will be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone himself. Jor-El promises to be silent and that he and his wife will not attempt to leave the planet. Jor-El chooses instead to construct a crystalline starship for his infant son Kal-El. Jor-El's wife Lara, however, is concerned, for the starship is programmed to take the child through a trans-galactic warp to a planet populated by primitive humans whose technological development is millennia behind Krypton, a planet that orbits a yellow sun, a planet called Earth. Jor-El, however, understands that the planet's yellow sun will give Kal-El superhuman powers, which will give him the advantage he needs to survive. Jor-El and Lara bid their child goodbye before Joe-El installs a green crystal into the ship, a crystal containing the very essence of himself and Lara as well as the knowledge of the entire universe. He then completes the assembly of the starship - just as the planet is pulled into a fatal plunge toward its red sun. The starship is launched and escapes the system scant minutes before the planet is torn open, collides with its central star, and both bodies are obliterated in a holocaust of fire and debris.The tiny starship passes the Phantom Zone before accelerating on its journey to the planet Earth, with the voice of Jor-El providing the infant, who is aging as the ship proceeds, with knowledge. The ship finally reaches Earth in the year 1951 A.D. and plunges like a meteor into a vast wheat field near Smallville, Kansas - within sight of local farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent. Upon seeing the meteor the Kents discover the now-three-year-old Kal-El. Martha, believing the child is a gift from God, decides to adopt him. The child demonstrates that he is different when, as Jonathan is changing a tire on his truck and the jack slips, he innocently lifts the vehicle with his bare hands, saving his foster father's life.After the truck is thus repaired the Kents and their newly adopted son drive away, leaving the meteor behind - but as its energy fades out it is clear it will become significant to the Kents in due time.Some fifteen years pass and Clark, named for Martha's maiden name, is a student at Smallville High School. He is a water boy on the school's football team, and friends with cheerleader Lana Lang, but is frequently bulled by Lana's jock boyfriend, Brad Wilson. Clark knows of the vast power he possesses but is forbidden by his father from showing it - although, alone on a football field, he kicks a ball into orbit, then runs home by outrunning a speeding passenger train (even to delightedly jumping across its nose), and is seen by a young girl who tries to tell her parents; her mother, however, scolds young ""Lois Lane"" about telling tall tales.Clark returns home as Brad, Lana, and other students drive by, surprised that he arrived home so quickly. Jonathan, however, reassures Clark that he is on Earth for a reason and that he should not let others bother him. Clark thus feels better, but as he starts to play with the family dog, Jonathan suddenly stops, having lost feeling in his left arm. He then falls to the ground, victim of a heart attack. After Jonathan's burial the grieving Clark blames himself, ""All those powers, and I couldn't even save him.""Some time later Clark is awakened early one morning by a mysterious noise, emanating from the barn. Clark enters the barn and finds the remains of the meteor, and with it the now-activated green crystal of Jor-El. Later that morning, Clark tells his mother that he must leave and head north. Martha, having known this day would come, urges her son to always remember her, and the tearful Clark vows to do just that as they embrace for one final time.Days later Clark reaches the North Pole, where he takes the green crystal and throws it miles into the distance, where it melts into the ice and begins construction of a gigantic crystalline fortress, a Fortress of Solitude. Inside Clark finds a matrix table of crystals; placing one into an aperture, he activates a dimensional communicator that reveals the preserved consciousness of Jor-El, his true father. Jor-El provides the youth with his true identity of Kal-El and takes his son on a journey through time and space to complete his maturation, educating him on the universe and on his purpose in life. When the journey ends, Kal-El has aged twelve years to the age of 30, although in the time-twisting of inter-dimensional travel the Earth has aged 22 years to the year 1978 A.D. The scene reveals the now fully matured Kal-El dressed in a red-and-blue costume with a long red cape and bearing his family symbol, ready to fulfill his purpose of protecting his new homeworld.-------------------------Metropolis, the greatest city in the world. At the skyscraper home of its largest newspaper, the Daily Planet, photographer Jimmy Olsen is shooting photos of a typically kinetic day in the life of the Planet, including ace reporter Lois Lane (who despite this status has a problem with spelling, frequently being corrected for misspelled words). Lois and Jimmy are introduced by the paper's grumpy editor, Perry White, to its newest member, a tall shy bespectacled news writer named Clark Kent. Lois is initially puzzled by the man's shyness and mild social clumsiness, and is particularly struck when the two of them are held up in a back alley by a gunman. Clark faints when the thug opens fire on Lois (the fainting is cover so Clark can catch the bullet in his bare hand, which causes the gunman to run), and in defending himself to Lois rattles off a listing of all the items in her purse.As Lois and Clark hail a taxi, walking past them is a white-dressed heavyset man munching on snacks and carrying a copy of the Planet. The man is tailed by Harry and Armis, two undercover cops, for he is Otis, an assistant for criminal genius Lex Luthor, and he is on his way to Luthor's secret hideout. The cops tail him to Metropolis Grand Central Station, where Harry sends Armis to get backup while he tails Otis onto subway Track 22 leading out of the station. Otis eventually finds an indentation in the underground tunnel and waits for a train to arrive. A doorway opens under the cover of the passing train, and after it is gone Harry goes to the doorway to try and figure out how to open it - a fatal mistake, for monitoring the scene from hidden security cameras is Luthor himself, who activates the doorway and violently pushes Harry into the path of another train.Luthor's moll, Eve Teschmacher, is appalled by the scene, but Luthor arrogantly and condescendingly reminds her that it is an inevitable by-product of his status as the greatest criminal mind of the latter 20th century, a status to which he takes egotistical delight. He tells her how his father (a cruel man who disowned Lex as a child), once told him that even if governments and economies collapse, people will still need land, and will do anything to get it. This has guided his criminal career ever since. When Otis arrives in their underground lair he is reminded of his clumsiness in allowing himself to be followed again. Thus he is given the unglamorous task of feeding ""the babies,"" a group of unidentified unseen creatures in a vast pit used to dispatch intruders. Luthor's more pressing concern, however, lies in a story in the Planet that two nuclear cruise-type missiles with hypersonic speed are to be tested using live multi-megaton warheads soon. Luthor intends to use the missile test to fulfill the greatest real estate swindle in history.Later that night, Lois Lane is scheduled to fly via Planet helicopter to Metropolis International Airport to greet Air Force One, but on the Planet's helipad she boards the chopper and when the chopper begins takeoff, a light cable breaks free of its bracket and in the updraft caused by the chopper snags its landing skids, breaks, and plunges the chopper out of control through the helipad's control shed and crashing onto the ledge. As police hustle panicking bystanders on the streets below to safety, Lois tries to crawl out of the chopper, but the ledge begins to crack and the chopper sags violently toward the street and Lois falls through, hanging on by a seat belt in the air.But amid the panic in the streets, Clark Kent emerges from the Planet and notices a yellow rain hat on the sidewalk. Upon recognizing it as one Lois was wearing, he sees the stricken chopper, and while those around him run for safey, Clark keeps his head, even while finding a suitable hiding place to change takes a bit of hunt in the vicinity. Running to another building down the street, Clark opens his shirt to reveal his emblem and then whirls through a revolving door at super speed to become effectively invisible and changes into Superman - to the awe and confusion of a nearby pimp.Superman takes off, just as Lois loses her grip on the seat belt and plunges towards the street below. Superman safely catches her and carries her upward. The chopper now breaks off the ledge and falls, but Superman safely snags it out of the air with one hand and carries it back to the Planet's helipad to the astonishment of the crowd below. When the awe-struck Lois asks who the stranger is, he merely replies, ""A friend."" She faints from pure exhaustion and disbelief.It is but the beginning, for Kal-El undertakes numerous feats of heroism - stopping a cat-burglar using gigantic magnets to scale the Solow Building, intercepting a boatload of bank-robbers, rescuing a cat from a tree, and rescuing Air Force One when a lighting strike shatters its portside engine and wing.The next morning, he returns to the Fortress of Solitude and consults the spirit of Jor-El to convey the emotions he felt upon making his full power known. Jor-El urges him to be circumspect in his power and praises him for what he has learned so far.After that busy night, Superman dominates the news about this astounding man doing his good deeds with seemingly impossible abilities. Watching the news about the stranger, Lex Luthor sees his arrival as a natural challenge, considering that Superman would surely have the inclination and the power to interfere with his scheme, and the criminal mastermind vows to destroy all that the stranger represents. Perry White, for his part, makes discovering the red-and-blue stranger the #1 priority of the Planet and sends his entire staff scurrying to find any scrap of information about ""this flying whatchamacallit."" Lois, however, scoops everyone when she gets a note requesting a dinner date at her penthouse from ""a friend.""The dinner date takes place and as part of the interview, in which Superman astounds the cynical reporter with his sincerely kind, courteous and altruistic personality, Kal-El gives Lois a ride in the sky - a flight that becomes almost a romantic dance as the two begin falling in love. Kal-El returns Lois to her apartment and the two bid reluctant goodbye. Lois quietly dubs him a true super man - and uses the term to identify the stranger in her subsequent front-page story. Luthor reads it and remembers a scientific theory; Superman's homeworld would be of a molecular construction that would be affected by the unique radiation of a yellow sun, and that meteors from Krypton upon landing on Earth would be affected to the point of emitting a radiation that would affect only Kryptonians. Such a meteorite was found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Miss Tessmacher is skeptical, as even with ""the rock,"" Superman could see them coming from miles away. But the interview hints at another weakness: Superman has difficulty seeing through lead. With their plan in place, they plan a trip to Ethiopia.Later, Luthor's gang go to work intercepting the two missile convoys used for the big upcoming test; using a variety of guises, they divert attention away from the effort to reprogram the missiles' directional vectors; Otis, however, misprograms one of the missiles, attributing this mistake to his arm not being long enough to write down the coordinates. Luthor violently attacks him for gross incompetence, but Miss Tessmacher calms him down while keeping the car they are in from crashing.The Planet learns that an unknown figure is buying up hundreds of acres of seemingly worthless desert in the southwest. Suspecting land fraud, Perry sends Lois and Jimmy to investigate. Had Clark showed more initiative and confidence, the assignment would have gone to him. As Perry shares a story about a ""worthless meteorite"" being stolen from an Ethiopian museum, Clark is struck by a piercing signal, a high pitched hum followed by the sound of every dog in Metropolis barking at once- it is Lex Luthor on a radio frequency only Superman (and the dogs) can hear. Luthor warns Superman that a poison gas pellet containing propane lithium compound is to be released into the air and kill the city's population unless Superman confronts him alone. Feigning a migraine, Clark sneaks away from his co-workers and jumps out a window, where he changes into Superman mid-flight and traces Luthor's signal to the street. He spins himself around and manages to drill through the ground and into Luthor's hideout, where he is attacked by the hideout's automated defense system - a wall of machine guns, then a wall of fire, finally a wall of liquid nitrogen that freezes the area. None has any effect on Superman, who casually walks through it all unharmed.Once inside the hideout, Superman demands knowledge of Luthor's gas pellet. Luthor lets the truth be known that it is a hoax, it was the only way to gain an audience with him. Luthor reveals his true plans for the stolen missiles; the first will destroy the San Andreas Fault, which will collapse the Western coastline of the US (namely California and its major cites) into the ocean and thus make the seemingly worthless desert of the west into multi-billion dollar windfalls. The second missile is designed to be a cover. Luthor boasts that nobody, not even Superman, can bring down both of them, and if necessary, he can detonate either warhead via remote. Superman notices a box made of lead which he assumes hides Luthor's detonator. But when he opens it he is struck by a massive weakness, for the box contains the Ethiopian meteorite - Kryptonite, fitted to a chain necklace that Luthor drapes around him. He takes great delight in reminding Superman that despite his aura of invincibility, a normal human has found a way to beat him. Superman asks if Luthor even cares about the second missile's target (the one misprogrammed by Otis) which is revealed to be Hackensack, NJ, before Luthor drops him into his pool to drown.Luthor, however, has made a fatal mistake, for due to Otis' misprogramming, Eve Teschmacher's mother lives in Hackensack. While Luthor and Otis monitor the errant missiles on their hypersonic flight, she pleads with Superman to stop the Hackensack missile first on his mission; he agrees and she frees him. Regaining his power, Superman blasts through the mammoth ceiling of the lair, into the sky, and on a direct course west. He tries to stop the first missile over Kansas but it dodges him, and he must overtake it and force it into space - just as the second missile detonates the San Andreas Fault, setting off an omnicidal quake that is like the destruction of Krypton all over again, a nightmare that doubly drives Superman as he flies underneath the Earth's crust to stabilize the land.However, the aftershocks prove no less deadly, and Superman flies all across the area rescuing people from the ensuing disasters. But amid his enormous feats of heroism, one person in particular needs help. Amid the aftershocks, Lois's car runs out of gas in the middle of a desert, and is swallowed by a massive fissure, effectively burying her alive. Superman eventually senses she is in danger. He finds the car and pulls it out of the ground. He quickly takes Lois' body out of the car, but is too late. She has suffocated and died. Superman tearfully kisses her, and then lays her body down. He stands over it silently for several moments. Superman finally screams a thunderous roar of anguish and then rages into the sky. He hears the voice of Jor-El, which reminds him that he must not interfere with human history. Recalling his failure to save Jonathan (""All those powers, and I couldn't even save him""), he becomes absolutely determined to save Lois. Pulling together all of his power and strength, Superman flies around Earth's perimeter faster and faster eventually reversing the planet's rotation and pulling time back with it. He soon fixes it back to its original direction and uses the extra time to get to Lois before her car is buried.As revenge for her betrayal, Luthor and Otis are preparing to drop Miss Teschmacher into the pit of ""the babies."" Superman, however, rescues her, and pointedly notes to Luthor that Miss Teschmacher's mother sends her love.Afterward, Superman delivers Luthor and Otis to a maximum security prison to hold them pending trial. Luthor shouts his defiance (mirroring Zod in the opening moments), but he is comically interrupted by Otis. As both men are led away by the guards, the prison warden thanks Superman for his good deeds. Superman humbly dismisses the praise as just his contribution to their mutual effort for the good of society even as he takes off into the high atmosphere to resume the patrol of his adopted home planet. Once there, Superman, happy that his self-appointed neverending battle has had a satisfying beginning, looks to the audience with a wink and a smile as he flies off for more adventures."

Jaws 2,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077766/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Police chief Brody must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters. Four years after the traumatic episodes at Amity Island that was terrorized by a 25-foot-long great white shark devouring beachgoers until it was destroyed, Amity Island is at peace and opened a hotel at the Holiday Inn. Days after the opening, beachgoers start to disappear, along with a beached, half-eaten killer whale. Brody becomes concerned about these incidents and fears that another Great White Shark is on the loose. Four years since the terrifying attacks inJaws (1975), yet another underwater predator stains the waters of Amity Island red. With Police Chief Martin Brody faced with a series of deaths, disbelief, and a possible new shark problem, and Mayor Larry Vaughn reluctant to take action, a group of teenagers, including Brody's sons, Mike and Sean, find themselves at the mercy of a rapacious, 30-foot great white shark. Can Brody rescue the trapped young sailors, and stop the ferocious, man-eating creature with the jaws of death, once and for all?—Nick Riganas Four years after the events of the first installment, another killer great white shark has surfaced and has started terrorizing the shores of Amity Island once again. After numerous incidents and mysterious disappearances, it is up to Chief Brody to once again take to the waters and stop the shark's reign of terror. Four years after the events of the original ""Jaws"", the town of Amity suddenly experiences a series of mysterious boating accidents and disappearances. Chief of Police Martin Brody fears that another shark is out there, but he is ignored by the townsfolk. Unfortunately, he's right: there is another Great White in the sea.—darkmage7280 Two divers are photographing the wreck of the Orca, Quint's boat from the first film, and are suddenly attacked and killed by a large great white shark, but not before one of the divers' camera catches a closeup photo of the shark's eye. The shark later prowls the coastal waters of Amity Island, killing a female water skier. The female driver of the speedboat tries to defend herself by first throwing a gasoline tank at the shark (accidentally spilling some on herself) and then igniting the fuel with a flare gun. The fire ignites the gas tank and the speedboat explodes, killing the driver and leaving the shark heavily scarred on the right side of its head.In addition to these incidents, a dead killer whale is beached at a nearby lighthouse with large wounds all over its body, which Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) suggests were caused by a great white shark. Once again, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't share Brody's belief that the town has another shark problem and warns him not to do something hasty. Later, Brody spots a section of a ruined speedboat bobbing in the surf just off the beach. When he goes to retrieve it, he encounters the burnt remains of the female speedboat driver.Brody angrily grounds his son Mike (Mark Gruner) because of his reluctance to find a summer job, preferring to go sailing every day, and gives him a job at the beach. That night Brody fills the hollow points of several bullets with cyanide and coats them with wax in the hope that he can poison the shark. The following day, while Brody is in an observation tower, he sees a large shadow produced by a school of bluefish, which he mistakes for a shark. In his haste, Brody orders everyone out of the water and fires his gun into the water, causing a panic. Later that evening, he receives the photo of the shark's eye taken by one of the attacked divers. Brody shows it to Vaughn and his Townsmen, but they refuse to accept the evidence put in front of them. Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo) (who has built a new resort in Amity to attract people) and the town council fire Brody for the beach incident, with Mayor Vaughn being the only one to vote against dismissal, and promote Deputy Hendricks (Jeffrey Kramer) to Brody's position.The next morning, Mike sneaks out and goes sailing with his friends, but has to take his young brother Sean (Mark Gilpin) along to stop him telling his parents about Mike's trip. Later, they go past a group of divers led by Tom Andrews (Barry Coe). Tom encounters the shark minutes after entering the water to catch lobsters and escapes, but suffers an embolism when he rushes to the surface too quickly. Tina (Ann Dusenberry) and Eddie (Gary Dubin) later encounter the shark when he attacks their sailboat, devouring Eddie and leaving Tina terrified and alone.Brody and his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) find the panicked diver being put into an ambulance, and Brody suspects that something must have scared him to make him come up so fast. Hendricks informs Brody that Mike has gone out sailing to the lighthouse with his friends. Brody insists on taking the police launch to rescue them, with Ellen and Hendricks both joining him. They find Tina's boat, with Tina hiding in the hull, who confirms Brody's suspicions about the shark in the area. Hendricks and Ellen take Tina ashore in a passing boat, while Brody continues to search for the teenagers using the police launch.All seems well with the other teenagers, until the shark appears, smashing into one of their sail boats, causing panic and their boats to collide with each other. Mike is knocked unconscious and is pulled out of the water just as the shark appears; two friends take him back to the shore for help. The rest of the teens remain floating on the wreckage of tangled boats, drifting out toward the open sea. A Harbor Patrol marine helicopter arrives and a line is rigged to tow the boats to shore, but before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks the chopper causing it to crash into the water. Sean also falls into the water, but is quickly saved by Marge (Martha Swatek). As Marge tries to get back into upturned boat, her hands slip on the wet hull, and she falls back into the water. The shark approaches and devours Marge leaving Sean traumatized. Back at mainland, Tina is sent to the hospital, and Ellen berates Peterson for getting Brody fired and denying the shark's presence.Brody encounters Mike, who informs his father about the situation. Sean and his friends are drifting on the wreckage toward Cable Junction, a small rocky island housing an electrical relay station (with the open sea beyond it). Brody quickly finds the teenagers, but the shark attacks again and Brody runs his boat aground on the rocks. Brody tries to tie a rope line, but snags an underwater power cable instead. Most of the teenagers are tossed into the water during the shark's next attack, and they swim to safety on Cable Junction, but the shark injures Lucy. Using an inflatable rubber raft, Brody gets the shark's attention by pounding the power line with an oar, and gets the shark to bite the power cable. The plan succeeds, the shark is electrocuted and sinks to the bottom of the sea, dead. Brody collects Sean and Jackie and paddles over to Cable Junction, to await rescue with the other teenagers."

Joe Pendleton is a football quarterback preparing to lead his team to the Superbowl when he is almost killed in an accident. An overanxious angel plucks him to heaven only to discover that he was not ready to die, and that his body has been cremated. Another body must be found without his death being discovered, and that of a recently murdered millionaire is chosen. His wife and accountant, the murderers, are confused by this development, as he buys the Los Angeles Rams in order to once again quarterback them into the Superbowl. At the same time, he falls in love with an English environmental activist who disapproves of his policies and actions.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> With the help of Max Corkle, his best friend and one of the team trainers, Joe Pendleton, the backup quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams behind Tom Jarrett, does whatever he can to stay in top shape physically and mentally to do his part to help the Rams win the Super Bowl. One of his mental relaxation techniques is to play the soprano saxophone, albeit very badly. Despite the media trying to paint a rivalry between him and Jarrett, Joe truly believes that Jarrett is not his competition, but rather the opposing team is. Regardless, his hard work pays off and he is named the starter for the upcoming game. However, as he is riding his bicycle through a tunnel before the game, Joe is killed in a collision with a truck,... or so it would seem. In actuality, a novice ""escort"" - the spirit accompanying the dead into heaven - took Joe out of the situation before the collision, not wanting to see Joe actually get ""hurt"", but Joe would have missed the truck as the official record shows he isn't scheduled to be in heaven for close to fifty years. So Mr. Jordan, the escort's boss, personally has to take over the case, needing to find another undiscovered dead body in which to place Joe, as his own body has already been cremated. Who Mr. Jordan finds as a temporary until a more suitable body can be found is that belonging to ruthless industrialist Leo Farnsworth, who was murdered by his wife, Julia Farnsworth, and his aide, Tony Abbott, the two who are having an affair. Joe not only has to pretend to be Farnsworth not knowing anything about business or his personal dealings, but stay ahead of Julia and Tony who would not be averse to trying to kill him again. But Joe has a change of heart about his temporary second chance at life, which he now wants to make permanent, when he sees an opportunity to get Farnsworth into ""Joe Pendleton"" shape to regain his old life as a Rams QB, which will entail convincing Max that he truly is Joe Pendleton. That change in heart is also bolstered upon meeting and falling in love with Betty Logan, an activist who is trying to stop the environmental bad practices of one of Farnsworth's factories in her hometown of Paglesham, England.—Huggo ""This isn't what I thought would happen to me."" Heaven Can Wait (1978) by Elaine May and Warren Beatty is a Fantasy Rom-Com about a Super Bowl-destined quarterback ""Joe Pendleton"" (Warren Beatty) who is prematurely removed from his body by a well-intentioned angel. Unable to return Joe to his now cremated body, the angel places Joe into the body (and life) of a recently murdered millionaire ""Leo Farnsworth,"" whose conspiring wife and lover are shocked to see him back among the living. Joe (as Leo) purchases the L.A. Rams football team and sets out to get Leo's body in shape with his former friend and trainer ""Max Corkle"" (Jack Warden), so he can lead them to victory. In the meantime, Joe falls in love with environmental activist ""Betty Logan"" (Julie Christie), who speaks out against Farnsworth's corporate policies. Ultimately, this story seems to be about second chances-in life, love, ambition, and murder-and maybe even a tiny suggestion that heavenly beings can also make mistakes. The ticking clock of the murderous Mrs. Farnsworth eventually succeeds in killing Leo, before the Super Bowl, and into the surprising twist of how Joe actually gets back in the game...and back to Betty.—T.B. Hayes Joe Pendleton is a football quarterback, who has not been playing a great deal because of injuries. But now it appears he has fully recovered and the coach wants to make him the starting quarterback. But he goes out one day and an accident occurs and the next thing he knows he is on his way to heaven. But he convinces the man in charge, Mr. Jordan, that he isn't suppose to be here and upon checking Mr. Jordan discovers that he is right and tries to get him back into his body but his body has been cremated. Mr. Jordan tells him that they can put him in another man's body provided that the man's death has not been discovered. Mr. Jordan now shows him the body of Leo Farnsworth, who has just been killed by his wife and secretary. Joe does not want to take Farnsworth's body until a woman, Betty Logan, who has a problem with what Farnsworth's business is doing to her home, insists on meeting him. Joe is now taken with her and would like to help her but can only do it if he assumes Farnsworth's identity. And he does but unfortunately still acts like himself which perplexes everyone who knows Farnsworth especially his wife and secretary who are sure that they killed him and are on the edge of their seats wondering what he's going to do.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Following a knee injury, Joe Pendleton, a Los Angeles Rams second-string quarterback, practices with the team as the managers and coach comment repeatedly on his good form. Away from the football field, he focuses on fitness and relaxes by playing the saxophone.On Joes birthday, Max Corkle, a Rams trainer and Joes good friend, drops by his home with a cake and informs him that the coach wants Joe to start the game against the Dallas Cowboys instead of Tom Jarrett. Joe steps up his training, but while bicycling through a tunnel he is hit by a van.With saxophone in hand, Joe arrives at a way station to Heaven accompanied by The Escort, a celestial assistant who instructs Joe to board an aircraft for his final destination. Joe refuses, believing it is only a dream. Delicately, the archangel man in charge, Mr. Jordan, explains that this place represents the afterlife, but Joe is convinced that his death is a mistake. After verifying Joes status, a clerk announces that Joe isnt due to arrive until the year 2025, and The Escort, a rookie, admits that he pulled him away before the outcome of the collision.Since Joes body has already been cremated, Mr. Jordan says that in order for him to return to life, Joe must occupy the body of another man, as long as that mans death has not yet been discovered. Mr. Jordan and Joe proceed to scout for possible candidates. At the estate of Leo Farnsworth, a millionaire industrialist, they observe the scheming of his wife Julia Farnsworth and Tony Abbott, Farnsworths assistant. Julia and Abbott are having an affair, and they have left Farnsworth to drown in the bathtub after drugging him.Meanwhile, Betty Logan, a schoolteacher, arrives at the mansion to insist on meeting with Farnsworth about his refinery that will force the eviction of families in her hometown of Pagglesham, England. Joe is immediately smitten with Betty and wants to help her. Until they find a more athletic candidate, Mr. Jordan agrees to let Joe inhabit the body of Farnsworth temporarily.In the upstairs bathroom, Joe assumes his new identity, but only sees himself in the mirror. Mr. Jordan assures him that even though Joe can only see himself as the internal person of Joe Pendleton, others will see and hear him as Leo Farnsworth. Dressed in polo attire, Joe listens while Betty objects to the plans of Farnsworths Exo-Grey Industries. Upon seeing her husband alive, Julia screams hysterically, and Abbott quickly drags her away. Betty is confused by Joes lack of concern for his wifes outburst, and is also annoyed when Joe claims that he is not really Leo Farnsworth. Believing that he is taunting her, Betty angrily walks away, but warns him that she will be at the next company board meeting.While Joe studies Farnsworths business, Julia and Abbott wait nervously, unsure if he is plotting revenge for the murder. On the way to the board meeting, Joe invites reporters and Betty to join him. Everyone in the room is dumbfounded when Joe passionately compares Exo-Greys winning position to that of a football team that must protect its lead and do the right thing by not exploiting others.That evening, after Betty visits Farnsworth to compliment him on his courage in front of the board, Joe takes her out to dinner at a drivein restaurant. Inside the limousine, Joe confides that he cannot stop staring at her, and Betty admits that she sees something special in his eyes. As they are saying goodbye, Joe declares his plan to divorce Julia. With a new motivation, Joe tells The Escort that he wants to remain in Farnsworths body and get it into shape for football.That evening, despite rigging a heavy fixture above his bed, Julia and Abbott once again fail to murder Farnsworth. The following day, Max arrives at the estate and listens with skepticism while Joe explains that he wants to try out for the Rams quarterback and pay Max to be his trainer. Max is reluctant to jeopardize his reputation with the Rams by entertaining the whims of a millionaire. After initially seeming like at lunatic, Joe is finally able to persuade Max that he is really Joe Pendleton by playing the saxophone badly, as only Joe could. The estate immediately becomes a football training camp. After working out with the butlers of the mansion, Joe takes the next step by purchasing the Los Angeles Rams.During a locker room meeting, the players grumble when told that the new owner Farnsworth will be the quarterback in a scrimmage game and instructed to not hold back with him. At first, Joe receives no help from his offensive line and is repeatedly sacked. But, after requesting one chance to complete a play, he makes a successful pass and continues to display his skills for the rest of the practice, earning the respect of the players and defying the doubters on the sideline.Sometime later at the estate, Joe and Betty attend a gathering of The Ecology Club on the garden lawn. Watching from her bedroom window with Abbott, Julia still thinks that Farnsworth is plotting against them, and contemplates another murder. After strolling together on the property, Joe asks Betty to marry him. Just as Betty responds with excitement, The Escort interrupts Joe with the news that he must abandon Farnsworths body. Unsure what will happen to him, Joe asks Betty to remember what she saw in his eyes. Before she leaves, he embraces her and says, Theres nothing to be afraid of.Mr. Jordan visits to reiterate that he cannot change what is meant to be and that Joe must leave Farnsworths body, but Joe refuses, intent on playing in the Super Bowl and being with Betty. At that moment, Abbott shoots Joe from the bedroom window, and Joe tumbles into a well. No longer in Farnsworths body, Joe emerges from the well with his saxophone and has no choice but to follow Mr. Jordan back to Heaven.Farnsworths disappearance becomes front-page news, and Krim, the police detective in charge, gathers together the staff along with Max, Betty, Julia, and Abbott for questioning at the estate. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl between the Rams and the Pittsburgh Steelers is underway at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and Max is anxious to be there, so Krim lets him watch the game on television during the proceedings. Concerned for Betty, Joe is present in the room alongside Mr. Jordan.When the Rams quarterback, Tom Jarrett, is seriously hurt and taken off the field on a stretcher, Mr. Jordan transports Joe to the game. Mr. Jordan explains that it is Toms destiny to die at this time. Joe moves toward Toms body and occupies it, springing off the stretcher and onto the field. Watching this sudden recovery on television, Max realizes that it must be Joe. At the same time, the gardener runs into the room with Farnsworths jacket that he found in the well, which prompts Julia to scream that Abbott is the murderer, and he in turn points the finger at her.In overtime, Joe leads the Rams to a Super Bowl victory. During the celebration in the locker room, Mr. Jordan appears before Joe declares that Joe now has a permanent body in Tom Jarrett and he will no longer remember Joe Pendleton, or any of the events that happened, but he will now live out the rest of his life as Tom Jarrett with all of Tom's memories, while Joe's memories of his past life and all about Mr. Jordan and Heaven will be forgotten forever.Later that evening, Joe doesnt recognize the saxophone, and thinks Max has drunk too much champagne when he calls him Joe. Max finally realizes that Joe as he knows him no longer exists. As Joe/Tom exits through a stadium hallway, Betty enters looking for Max. After giving her directions, Joe/Tom wonders if they have met before. Betty says she doesnt know him, but she has a connection to football through her close friend, Leo Farnsworth. When the lights of the hallway are switched off, Joe/Tom assures Betty that theres nothing to be afraid of and guides her out the door. Betty is touched by what he said, recalling her last conversation with Farnsworth. Joe/Tom asks her out for coffee, and when Betty realizes that he is the quarterback, she says yes at once."
Hooper,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077696/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Aging Hollywood stuntman Sonny Hooper wants to prove that he's still got what it takes to be a great professional in this risky, under-recognized line of work. Aging stuntman Sonney Hooper is still on top as one of the best stuntmen in the business. But up-and-coming Ski is starting to do bigger and better stunts. Hooper has the experience to set up a stunt safely, and Ski lacks the common sense to know when a stunt is too dangerous. Maybe together, along with their fun loving buddies, they can do a stunt together that will surpass anything that anyone has done.—Brian W Martz <B.Martz@Genie.com> Sonny Hooper, Hollywood's greatest stuntman, deals with his relationship with the daughter of his mentor, a challenge from a young stuntman who idolizes him, and the egomaniacal director of his latest movie. He ultimately attempts to perform a record-breaking jump over a gorge in a rocket-propelled car.—Damian Penny <g0mb@unb.ca> Sonny Hooper is a highly-regarded and highly paid Hollywood stuntman. While filming a big-budget spy movie -- a send-up of the James Bond series -- he is ordered to pull off several ""gags"" that put him at increasing risk. His long-term girlfriend, Gwen, worries constantly over the chances Sonny takes, especially since Sonny has already gone through spinal surgery to correct many years of rough work on the job. Sonny's best friend, Cully, advises Sonny to cut back but Sonny is addicted to the adrenaline rush of the work he does, regardless of the fact that he's often in a lot of pain, takes too many pills and receives too many anesthetic injections, and the danger of partial or full paralysis.At a benefit for charity, Sonny meets a young upstart, Delmore Shidski, who jumps from a helicopter at dizzying height, parachutes for a short period and unhooks his chute and lands in a large airbag. Sonny and Cully are both impressed, even though Sonny is also envious that the young ""Ski"" is younger and in better physical condition. When Ski is supposed to race an old-timer named Hammerhead in a Roman chariot race, Sonny convinces his friend to step out and put on underwear -- the man had wanted to be authentic wearing his uniform -- and Sonny races the man's chariot against Ski instead. Ski's chariot breaks apart during the race and he's dragged until Sonny is able to stop the two horses pulling it. In a petulant act, Sonny has his own horse, Dancer, befoul Ski's car.The gang later goes to a popular restaurant, the Palomino Club, where Sonny and his friend Jocko -- Gwen's father and a former stuntman himself -- annoy a nearby table of SWAT officers in town for a convention. Jocko has been talking loudly enough that two of the SWAT guys want a refund of the money they put in the jukebox. Sonny smashes the juke by running into it wearing a motorcycle helmet but the SWAT guys become even more hostile and a fight breaks out. Ski joins Sonny's team without hesitation but everyone is eventually rounded up by the bouncers and thrown out. When Ski is tossed out with them, Sonny has newfound respect for Ski's ability to hold his own and support Sonny's team. Everyone goes to Sonny's house for an after party. Ski shows a good amount of hero worship for Sonny while they watch films of Sonny's best work. Later, Jocko asks Sonny why he hasn't decided to marry Gwen and Sonny becomes resistant.After successfully jumping from a helicopter, Sonny quietly asks Cully to take him to see his orthopedist. The doctor tells Sonny straight that if he takes a serious hit on his spine, he'll be quadriplegic. Sonny also forms a friendly relationship with Ski, admiring the young upstart's innovation for the action movie they're both working on and drawing the approval of the film's egotistical and overbearing director, Roger. Roger later angers the film's writer enough that the man quits and leaves Roger to rewrite the film's finale: the production has use of a small industrial town that's due to be completely demolished. The rewrite has Sonny and Ski driving to a halt at a small ravine where a bridge has been destroyed. Sonny and Ski come up with an extremely dangerous gag: they'll jump a 1978 Firebird, outfitted with a large jet engine, 325 feet across the ravine after the bridge is demolished. Though the jump can be done, there's no guarantee that the car will land safely for Sonny and Ski. The studio's producer promises to meet Sonny's suggested fee of $50,000 each for Sonny and Ski.Due to budgeting cutbacks, Cully is cut from the production crew. Drunk at Sonny's house, he lets slip the upcoming stunt run to Gwen. Gwen becomes very upset, telling Sonny that if he attempts the gag, she'll leave him. The two seem to reconcile later when Jocko suffers a minor stroke.On the day of the shoot, Sonny and Ski drive their Firebird through the chaos of the village's demolition, Ski doing the driving and Sonny keeping tabs on the instruments for the jet engine. As they race along, Sonny notices that the gas pressure needed to power the jet engine has dropped significantly. Ski stops short of the wrecked bridge and tells Sonny they can't attempt the jump because the gas pressure is too low. Sonny convinces Ski to make the jump for the money and hits the ignition switch. The car flies easily across the gap and lands very hard on the other side. Both men seem to be stunned but they recover after a few moments. Gwen rushes to Sonny's side and he smiles, indicating that he's OK. Roger finds them and congratulates them both, admitting he's been overbearing. Sonny contemplates Roger's comments for a few seconds and hits the director in the face, knocking him out. The film ends with Sonny smiling."

Mike is upset and walks out when Linda shows up.At the Russian wedding reception, there is lots of drinking, ethnic dancing and wedding rituals.

Nick makes Mike promise to bring him back to Clairton if something happens.The morning after, with the car still decorated from the wedding, the men drive into the mountains to go deer hunting. Mike takes hunting very seriously, having expressed his one shot theory to Nick previously, and gives Stan a cold shoulder when Stan wants to borrow socks and then can't find his hunting boots.

Frustrated, Stan pulls out a small handgun he carries and Nick breaks up the confrontation. The next morning, Mike and Nick go out into the woods and hunt (to Rachmaninoff's dramatic piece ""Praise the Name of the Lord""). Mike has told Nick he is the only one of the group he will hunt with, having no respect for the others. Mike stalks and shoots a deer, bringing it down in a single shot.The troupe returns to Clairton and they go straight to John's bar. John plays a somber piece on the piano and the men sit mostly silent, contemplating their last night together as a group.The story shifts to a mountainous region of Vietnam where a small village is a battleground. Michael is there, lying unconscious among several dead bodies. A North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldier walks into the village. He finds a small group of survivors, women and children, hiding in a small bunker. He casually arms a grenade, tosses it in and walks off as it explodes. Moments later he sees a woman, badly injured, carrying a baby. The soldier mercilessly shoots her. Mike springs up and blasts the soldier with a flamethrower. As Mike walks around shooting any surviving NVA soldiers, a unit of helicopters arrive and drop troops, among them are Nick and Steve. Mike, with a thousand-yard stare, doesn't seem to recognize them at first when incoming mortar shells from the NVA begin to hit the fields around the village. In the distance, a squad of NVA are approaching.The three are captured and held prisoner in a crude riverside encampment along with other US Army and ARVN prisoners. For entertainment, the guards force their prisoners to play Russian roulette and gamble on the outcome. Steven is suffering a mental breakdown and is chosen first. He pulls the trigger but the gun is aimed above his head, grazing him with the bullet. Though their captors laugh, he is punished by incarceration to a rat-infested partially submerged cage. Believing that the experience has broken Steven, Mike considers abandoning him in his planned escape attempt. Nick angrily rejects Mike's idea.Mike, convinces the guards to let him go head-to-head with Nick in the next round, after devising a plan to escape that requires three bullets in the pistol and shares his plan with Nick. Mike tells him to go after the closest gun when Mike makes his move. Mike successfully convinces their captors use three bullets in the cylinder. Coaxing their captors into laughing as a small distraction, Mike raises the gun to his head and at the last minute pushes the rifles pointed at him aside while turning the gun on his captors. Mike and Nick grab their captors' AK-47s and kill them all before freeing Steve.The three escape the camp by floating downriver on a tree.

He knows Michael is coming back to Haddonfield, but by the time the town realizes it, it'll be too late for many people.—Massive Fan In 1963, Michael Myers stabbed his 15-year-old sister to death. He was institutionalized and according to his doctor, Sam Loomis, is the personification of evil. On the day before Halloween 15 years later, Myers manages to escape and heads for his home town. On Halloween night, he goes on a rampage while Loomis and the local sheriff search Myers' neighborhood for him. Meanwhile Laurie Strode, a serious student who rarely goes out on dates, is babysitting a neighbor's child. Little does she know the danger she is in.—garykmcd October 31, 1963, Haddonfield, Illinois. Possessed by an unfathomable urge to kill, six-year-old Michael Myers butchers his fifteen-year-old sister, Judith, on the night of Halloween. Precisely fifteen long years later, on the anniversary of the brutal murder, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium, a mental health facility for the criminally insane, and returns home. And before long, Michael becomes fixated on blissfully unsuspecting high school student Laurie Strode and her friends, Annie and Lynda. In the meantime, Myers' psychiatrist, Dr Samuel Loomis, and sceptical Sheriff Leigh Brackett comb the town to ferret out the mentally unstable inmate. However, the shadows are thick, and the silent killer is always one step ahead of them. Has Michael Myers returned to pick up where he left off?—Nick Riganas On a cold Halloween night in 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers brutally murdered his 17-year-old sister, Judith. He was sentenced and locked away for 15 years. But on October 30, 1978, while being transferred for a court date, a 21-year-old Michael Myers steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove. He returns to his quiet hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he looks for his next victims. The film opens with a brief opening title/credits sequence showing a Jack-o-Lantern accompanied by John Carpenter's famous theme music. The shot slowly moves closer and closer. Once it stops, the lighting quickly changes to reveal that the eye and nose form the shape of a man holding a knife.The film begins on October 31, 1963, a cold Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois. In the middle of a street stands a two-story white Victorian house. Someone begins walking toward it, and sees a 17-year-old Judith Margaret Myers (Sandy Johnson) through the front door, kissing her boyfriend (David Kyle) passionately. As they move towards the couch in the living room, the person outside follows them around the side of the house and watches through the window. The boyfriend asks Judith if they are alone and she replies that someone by the name of Michael is around someplace. Her boyfriend puts on a clown mask jokingly and kisses her. She laughs and tells him to take it off and he suggests that they go upstairs to have sex. They run up the staircase as the person outside the house follows them back around to the front. The Shape sees the light in the upstairs window go out and begins swiftly walking back to the side of the house through the kitchen door. Quickly, the Shape opens a drawer and grabs a very sharp knife. It begins slowly creeping through the dining and living rooms and reaches the bottom of the staircase. There, Judith's boyfriend is putting his shirt back on and leaving the house. Judith calls down the staircase for him to call her the next day. He takes one last look upward and quietly leaves. As soon as this happens, the shape begins walking up the stairs into the dark hallway. Looking down, it sees the clown mask on the floor. The Shape picks it up and pulls it over its face. Entering Judith's bedroom, it sees her sitting in front of her mirror, nude except for a pair of panties, brushing her hair. She has her back to the shape and is unaware that it is standing there. The Shape walks up behind her and she finally feels its presence. Swirling around, she sees that it is Michael (Will Sandin), the person previously referenced, and is annoyed, quickly covering her breasts. But suddenly, Michael raises the knife and begins stabbing her repeatedly in various areas of her body. After a few seconds, she falls to the ground, covered in blood. Swiftly, the shape walks out of the bedroom, down the stairs, and out the front door into the yard as a car pulls into the driveway. They are Mr. and Mrs. Myers, Judtih's parents. Seeing Michael, they pull off his clown mask, revealing the face of a young 6-year-old boy staring into space with a blank expression, still clutching the knife in one hand.On October 30, 1978, nearly 15 years later, in Smith's Grove, Illinois, a doctor by the name of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and his assistant, a nurse named Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), are driving to the local sanitarium to have Michael Myers, now 21 years old and still very dangerous, taken to a hearing in front of a judge, where his future incarceration will be determined. In the car is a matchbook with an advertisement for the Rabbit in Red Lounge. As Marion quietly smokes a cigarette, she questions Dr. Loomis's desire to do this when suddenly, they see that several mental patients are lurking around the entrance to the sanitarium. Dr. Loomis rushes out of the car into the rain to see what is going on just as a patient leaps on top of the car. It is Michael Myers (now played by Nick Castle). Marion rolls down the window to see what he is doing up there and his hand reaches through the window and grabs Marion's hair, causing the car to swerve off the road. He and Marion struggle for a moment until she pulls away and moves toward the other side of the car. Instantly, Michael's hand appears at the window behind her and shatters it. Marion, startled, opens the car door and jumps out. Michael climbs in and drives away. Dr. Loomis runs over to Marion and consoles her, telling her that the evil is gone.The next day, on Halloween in Haddonfield, a young girl of about 17-years-old named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is leaving her house to walk to school. On her way out, her father Morgan Strode (Peter Griffith), a real estate agent, tells her not to forget to drop a key off at the old abandoned Myers house because a family is coming by to look at it later. As Laurie continues down the streets, an 8-year-old boy, Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews), walks up to her. Laurie is babysitting him that night. As they walk together, the Myers house comes into view. Tommy tells Laurie not to go up there because something bad happened there once. As she drops the key under the mat, someone appears inside and looks through the front door at her. Laurie leaves and continues walking with Tommy, who says he received the information about the house being haunted from Lonnie Elamb (Brent Le Page), whom Laurie says will probably never get out of the sixth grade. Tommy leaves soon after this, and Laurie walks on, singing to herself, when suddenly, the Shape from inside the Myers house appears right behind, staring after her.Meanwhile, back in Smith's Grove, Dr. Loomis is debating with another doctor, Terence Wynn (Robert Phalen), about whether or not Michael has returned to his hometown in Haddonfield. Dr. Wynn doesn't think Michael could drive to Haddonfield and blames Dr. Loomis for not warning the staff about the potential for Michael's outburst. Dr. Loomis angrily gets in his car and drives away.Later that day, Laurie sits in English class at Haddonfield High School when she sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car parked on the street outside the window. Michael stands beside it, in a greyish-white mask, watching her. Laurie is frightened and continues to look back, when suddenly, the teacher calls on her to answer a question, startling her. Laurie responds to the question, and when she looks back through the window, Michael and the car have disappeared.Meanwhile, at the Haddonfield Elementary School, the bell rings, and children begin running out of the building. Tommy is leaving school carrying a large pumpkin, followed by several bullies who are taunting him about how the boogeyman is coming to get him that night. Tommy is confused, not knowing about the boogeyman, but is also frightened. He begins to run away, but he trips and falls, squashing the pumpkin. The bullies laugh and run out through the playground gate, when instantly, Michael jumps out and grabs one of them. Terrified, the bully scurries away. Michael climbs back into the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and begins to drive alongside Tommy, who is walking down the sidewalk sadly. Michael then drives off.On the highway somewhere between Smith's Grove and Haddonfield, Dr. Loomis stands at a telephone booth, speaking with someone from the Haddonfield police department, who seems resistant to the idea that Michael could be coming to Haddonfield. Dr. Loomis, frustrated again, hangs up the phone. But before he can drive away, he notices a tow truck parked nearby in a grassy area. Inside, he finds Michael's white hospital gown and the Rabbit in Red Lounge matchbook. Now Dr. Loomis is sure that Michael is in Haddonfield and rushes back to his car, not noticing the unclothed body of the tow truck driver (Barry Bernardi) lying in the nearby grass.Meanwhile, the students are being released at Haddonfield High School. Laurie is walking home with her friend Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles), who's complaining about how many school activities she will have to be involved with in the next day, being such a popular and beautiful girl. Laurie, however, seems to be a quiet bookworm who has nothing to do except babysit. As they walk along, another young girl named Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) finds them. Annie and Laurie talk about their babysitting assignments for that night; Laurie is babysitting Tommy, and Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards), who lives across the street a few houses away. While they are talking, the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car goes speeding down the street. Annie yells down the street at the driver that speed kills and, suddenly, the car stops but instantly speeds back up and leaves again. Forgetting this matter and not realizing that they had a close encounter with Michael, Annie and Lynda share a cigarette and begin devising a plan to get Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob, together at the Wallace house where Annie is babysitting to have sex.Laurie and Annie continue on, when suddenly, Laurie sees Michael hiding behind a bush ahead of them. Annie doesn't see him, and when she rushes over to the bush, there is nobody there. Annie thinks that Laurie is seeing men behind bushes because she is desperate for a date. Annie reaches home, leaving Laurie behind, who still thinks that there was someone behind that bush. Looking behind her, she accidentally runs into Mr. Brackett (Charles Cyphers), Annie's father and the sheriff of Haddonfield. Laurie is startled, and Brackett , the local sheriff, replies that it is Halloween and everyone is entitled to one good scare. Laurie laughs and walks back towards her house. Walking into her bedroom, she looks out of the window and sees Michael standing in her neighbor's back yard, staring up at her from between two rows of clothes hanging on a line. One second he is there, the next second he is gone. Suddenly, the phone rings, and Laurie runs over to it. When no one answers and she only hears the sound of chewing, she hangs up, terrified. The phone rings once again and it is Annie on the other end. She asks why Laurie hung up on her and she replies that she thought it was an obscene phone call. Annie says that she had her mouth full and couldn't speak, telling Laurie that she will be picking her up for their babysitting assignments at 6:30 pm. Laurie hangs up and lies on her bed, trying to console herself. Later that day, Annie picks Laurie up at her house to go babysitting, and they drive around for a while smoking a marijuana cigarette.Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis arrives at the Haddonfield Cemetery with the graveyard keeper (Arthur Malet), apparently with the intent to visit Judith's grave. They discover that Judith's headstone is now missing; Dr. Loomis knows now there can be no doubt that Michael is somewhere in Haddonfield.Back in Annie's car, the girls smoke marijuana and talk. Laurie tells Annie about seeing someone in her neighbor's back yard, while behind them Michael, still driving the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car, slowly cruises down the road, stalking them. Laurie begins to cough after smoking the marijuana when suddenly, they spot Mr. Brackett in front of a store in the distance and Annie orders Laurie to get rid of the joint. They pull into the parking lot and speak with Mr. Brackett, who says that someone--probably kids--broke into the store and stole a few masks, ropes, and knives. Annie replies that he blames everything on kids and that he is a cynical father. Mr. Brackett dismisses them because they will be late, and they leave down the street toward their baby-sitting assignments. After they leave, Dr. Loomis pulls up to the store and asks to speak with Mr. Brackett, who says it will be about ten minutes. Dr. Loomis stands waiting on the sidewalk as the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car passes right behind him.In Annie's car, Laurie is worried that Mr. Brackett knew that they were smoking pot, and Annie thinks there is nothing to worry about. They begin discussing next day's school dance, and Laurie reveals to Annie that she has a crush on a boy named Ben Tramer. Soon after this, they arrive at their destinations. Annie drops Laurie off at the Doyle house and pulls into the driveway of the Wallace house. As she walks into the house, the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car pulls up along the curve. Michael gets out the car and hides behind a tree in the Wallace yard, watching Annie.Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis and Mr. Brackett arrive at the abandoned Myers house. They begin to search inside, when they find a partially eaten dog (off-camera). Mr. Brackett says a man couldn't eat a dog like that, and Dr. Loomis replies that this isn't a man. The two of them walk upstairs, and Dr. Loomis shows Mr. Brackett the bedroom where Judith was murdered. Suddenly, a downspout falls away from the building and breaks the window near them, startling Dr. Loomis, who draws his gun. He begins describing his 15-year experience of watching Michael, seeing nothing but ""pure evil"" inside him. Mr. Brackett asks what they should do, and Dr. Loomis tells him to inform the rest of the police, just to ask them to keep their mouths shut. Dr. Loomis decides to stay behind and wait for Michael because he thinks he will return to the Myers house.At the Doyle house, Laurie sits, reading King Arthur to Tommy. Tommy becomes bored and says that he doesn't like that book and reveals several comic books that he has been hiding in the couch, saying that his mom doesn't want him to read them. Soon after this, Tommy asks Laurie what the boogeyman is, but suddenly, the phone rings before she can reply. It is Annie, calling from the Wallace house. She tells Laurie that she just spoke with Ben Tramer and told him that Laurie was really attracted to him. Laurie becomes angry and embarrassed, and begs Annie to say that she didn't talk to him. Right at this moment, Tommy looks out the window and sees The Shape standing next to the Wallace house, a black silhouette. He screams for Laurie that the boogeyman is outside, but when Laurie looks out the window, no one is there, and she continues her conversation on the phone.At this time, Michael has reached the back of the house near the kitchen door. Inside, Annie is in the kitchen making popcorn, not noticing Michael. She complains about Lester, Lindsey's dog, bothering her with his barking. Suddenly, Annie accidentally pours the butter all over her shirt and pants, and removes them while Michael continues to watch. Annie finds a small button-up shirt and puts it on, wearing nothing else other than panties. At this moment, Michael accidentally knocks a hanging plant to the ground, shattering it and drawing Annie's attention to the kitchen door. But Michael has gone to another window when Lester, who is now outside, sees him and begins barking. Annie complains to Lindsey again that Lester is getting on her nerves, but soon after this, she hears Lester stop barking and begin whimpering. Outside, Lester is dangling in the air and his feet are starting to go limp as Michael kills him.Inside the Doyle house, Laurie and Tommy sit watching The Thing. Once again, Tommy asks Laurie about the boogeyman. Laurie says that the boogeyman and all other Halloween superstitions are all make-believe and that Halloween is only a time when people play tricks on each other. Seeing that Tommy's still afraid, Laurie promises that she won't let anything happen to him. Tommy asks to make the jack-o-lantern at this time and they go into the kitchen.At the Wallace house, Annie goes to the outdoor laundry room in the back yard and puts her clothes in the washing machine, never seeing The Shape peering in at her from the door and windows. After accidentally locking herself inside, Annie calls for Lindsey to come and let her out, but Lindsey doesn't hear her. When the phone rings, Lindsey answers it and it's Annie's boyfriend, Paul (an uncredited John Carpenter). Lindsey finds Annie stuck in the laundry room window and releases her. After they go back into the house, Paul calls again and tells Annie that his parents left his house and he has an opportunity to sneak out to see her. He asks her to come pick him up.Annie takes Lindsey across the street to the Doyle house so Laurie can watch her for the time being. Laurie is reluctant, but Annie promises to talk to Ben Tramer in the morning and tell him that they were just fooling around when she called him. Finally, Laurie agrees, and Annie goes back to the Wallace house. She enters the garage, whistling and singing to herself, and tries to open her car door, but it is locked. Frustrated, Annie goes back into the house and finds the keys, brushing her hair a bit in the mirror, and still wearing nothing underneath her coat except a shirt and panties. Reentering the garage, she opens the car.... not noticing that it is now unlocked. Just as she sits down in the driver's seat, she realizes what has just happened. She reaches up to wipe the fog from the windshield, when suddenly, Michael leaps out from the back seat and grabs her throat. He mercilessly strangles her until she weakens and then swiftly withdraws a knife and slits her throat. Annie's eyes go wide as her face slides down the window, and she dies.Inside the Doyle house, Tommy and Lindsey are watching television when Tommy hides behind a curtain and whispers Lindsey's name, trying to scare her. Tommy turns around, and, to his horror, he sees Michael carrying Annie's lifeless body back into the Wallace house. Suddenly, Lindsey bumps into Tommy and they both scream. Tommy yells for Laurie, saying that they boogeyman is outside again, but she tells him to stop talking about it. Tommy complains that no one believes him, but Lindsey decides that she will.Meanwhile, at the Myers house, Dr. Loomis stands waiting behind a bush. After a while, three children, one of whom is Lonnie Elam, come along and dare each other to go inside. Trying to protect them, Dr. Loomis speaks in a menacing tone and yells at them to go away. They scurry away from the house and run down the street. Suddenly, Mr. Brackett jumps out behind Dr. Loomis, startling him. Mr. Brackett complains, telling Dr. Loomis that it will take more than fancy talk to keep him up all night crawling around bushes. Dr. Loomis warns him once again of Michael's evil, and Mr. Brackett questions if all the families and children in Haddonfield could be lined up for a slaughterhouse. Dr. Loomis replies that they could be. Mr. Brackett agrees to continue looking for Michael in the case that Dr. Loomis is right, but he adds that if he is right, ""Damn you for letting him go.""Back at the Wallace house, Lynda and Bob arrive in a van, both sipping from cans of beer and are considerably drunk. They go over the plan that Annie will distract Lindsey while they go to the bedroom upstairs to have sex, not knowing that Lindsey is at the Doyle house and that Annie is dead. Bob lifts Lynda into the air and carries her into the house. Once they go inside, they find all the lights off and no one there. Seeing this as an opportunity, they fall onto the couch, kissing passionately, while Michael silently watches nearby.At this time, in the Doyle house, Laurie, Tommy, and Lindsey have finished carving the jack-o-lantern and walk into the living room, making spooky noises. They all sit down on the couch to finish watching the movie, when suddenly, the phone rings. It is Lynda calling from the Wallace house while lying on the couch with Bob's head in her lap. She asks where Annie is; Laurie replies that she went to pick up Paul, and she thought she'd be home by this time. Laurie tells Lynda to call when Annie gets back because she has Lindsey at the Doyle house, and she needs to know what time to put her to bed. Enthusiastically, Lynda hangs up the phone and tells Bob that Lindsey is gone for the night, and they run upstairs. Laurie watches as the lights go out across the street.Upstairs in the Wallace house, Lynda and Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) are having sex while the phone rings continuously. Lynda warns Bob not to answer it for fear it might be the Wallaces. Bob takes the phone off the hook and they resume the moment, not noticing Michael's shadow sliding across the wall. Soon after this, they stop, and Lynda lights a cigarette for each of them, ordering Bob to go downstairs for a beer. She giggles as he goes downstairs, this being the best night of her life.Downstairs, Bob gets two beers out of the refrigerator and is about to pour them into glasses when he hears a noise. He looks outside through the kitchen door, but no one is there. Annoyed, he opens the pantry door when suddenly, Michael jumps out and shoves him against the set of cabinets on the opposite wall! Michael lifts Bob into the air, stabs a sharp knife through his stomach and into the wall, and Bob dies. Michael stands there for a moment, watching Bob's lifeless body like a curious animal.Upstairs, Lynda sits filing her nails when the bedroom door creaks open and Michael stands there, covered with a sheet and Bob's glasses over his eyes. Lynda thinks this is Bob dressed as a ghost and asks him where the beer is. He won't answer, so she drops the sheet around her, exposing her breasts. When the Shape still won't answer her, she becomes annoyed and gets up to call Laurie and ask where Annie and Paul are. She dials the number, but just as she is about to speak, Michael comes behind her and strangles her to death with the telephone cord! At which time she screams, leaving Laurie thinking it is Annie playing a prank. Finally, after Lynda dies, Michael picks up the phone, listening to Laurie's voice. She puts the phone down and looks out the window as all the lights in the Wallace house turn off. Laurie dials the number for the Wallace house, but no one answers. Going upstairs, Laurie sees that Tommy and Lindsey are sound asleep.Meanwhile, back at the Myers', Dr. Loomis still stands waiting, when suddenly, he sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car! Dr. Loomis begins running down the street, sure of where Michael is.At the Doyle house, when Laurie still receives no word from anyone, she grabs her keys and curiously ventures across the street. Upon reaching the front door, she finds it locked and rings the doorbell. There is no answer. Laurie walks around the side of the house to the kitchen door. Going inside, she searches around for any signs of Annie, Lynda, or Bob, thinking this is a trick. Not finding them anywhere, she walks upstairs and sees the light from a jack-o-lantern streaming underneath the bedroom door. Opening it, she sees in horror Annie's lifeless body on the bed with Judith Myers's headstone above her. In tears, Laurie backs against the closet when suddenly, Bob's body drops down into the doorway, hanging from the ceiling. Laurie screams in terror just as the closet door opens, revealing Lynda's body as well.Laurie runs out of the bedroom into the hallway, backing against the wall. Out of a darkened room, Michael's mask appears in the doorway behind her. Laurie walks forward, standing against the balcony.... when Michael reaches out with his knife and stabs her in the shoulder! Laurie screams louder than ever and falls over the balcony railing, crashing down onto the staircase and spraining her ankle. Michael rushes over to the top of the stairs and begins walking toward her. Laurie leaps up and rushes towards the front door hurriedly, but it won't budge. She runs through the living room to the kitchen, locking the door behind her. She rushes to the kitchen door, the way she came in, but a rake has been shoved under the doorknob outside. She is trapped! Suddenly, Michael's hand breaks through the other door behind her as he turns the lock and enters the room. Terrified, Laurie smashes through the glass with her bare hand and knocks the rake over. Shoving the door open, she runs out of the house and stumbles into the yard.She screams for help and runs onto the porch of another house, but no one will help her. Hurrying across the street to the Doyle house, she reaches for the keys in her pocket, but they are gone! Panicking, she bangs on the door, but Tommy is fast asleep. Just then, Michael appears behind the Wallace house and Laurie begins to yell for Tommy. Grabbing a potted plant, she throws it at Tommy's bedroom window, waking him. He slowly walks downstairs, unaware of the trouble. Finally, he reaches the front door just in time and lets Laurie in. She locks the door and orders Tommy to go upstairs. Turning out the lights, Laurie believes that she is safe, when instantly, she sees in terror that a window is open. Scared beyond imagination, she crouches down in front of the couch when suddenly, Michael leaps out from behind the couch and tries to stab her, but he misses and hits the couch instead. Laurie grabs a knitting needle and swirls around, stabbing Michael in the neck. He staggers backward and hits the floor, apparently dead. Laurie, nearly passing out because of blood loss, drops the knife that is still in the couch onto the floor and goes upstairs to check on the kids.Outside, Dr. Loomis still walks down the sidewalk when Mr. Brackett's police car pulls up. Dr. Loomis tells him that he found the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and he will head over to where Michael is. Mr. Brackett drives away, now truly believing what is going on.Upstairs at the Doyle house, Tommy and Lindsey run up to Laurie, thinking that it was the boogeyman who attacked her. She assures them that he is dead, but Tommy says that she couldn't have killed him because he is incapable of being harmed. At this moment, Michael lumbers toward them, and Tommy and Lindsey run back into the bedroom. Laurie scurries into another room, opening a set of doors leading to the balcony and, hiding in a closet, tries to fool Michael as to where she actually is. She ties a pair of stockings over the closet's doorknobs, but Michael soon begins shaking the doors and reaches through them with his knife, slicing the stockings! He breaks down the top half of the closet door and reaches in for Laurie, accidentally turning the light on. Laurie grabs a wire hanger and stabs Michael in the eye with its point. He jumps back in pain, dropping the knife into the closet. Laurie takes it, clutching it in her hands, and stabs Michael in the chest. He falls to the ground, dead. Laurie carefully slips out of the closet and, seeing this, drops the knife. Asking Tommy and Lindsey to come out, she tells them to go down the street to the McKenzies' house and tell them to call the police. They leave the house, screaming, attracting the attention of Dr. Loomis, who is outside and runs up to the Doyle house.Inside, Laurie is slumping against the doorway of the room where she was hiding, tired and almost unconscious. She doesn't notice that Michael, thought to be dead, is slowly rising behind her. Laurie stands up, leaving the room, when suddenly, Michael grabs her by the neck and begins to strangle her. Laurie fights back and pulls his mask off, revealing Michael's true face. Instantly, Dr. Loomis appears at the top of the staircase and shoots Michael with his gun. Michael falls backwards into another room as Laurie falls against the wall behind her, covering her ears. Dr. Loomis chases the murderer into the other room and sees him standing in front of the balcony doors. Dr. Loomis shoots him five more times, causing him to fall out the doors and off the balcony. Michael slams onto the ground below, appearing to be dead. The doctor looks back at Laurie, who says, ""It was the boogeyman."" Dr. Loomis solemnly replies, ""As a matter of fact, it was."" Looking back down below, he sees in horror that Michael has vanished, but Dr. Loomis knew all along that this would happen. Laurie realizes that Michael still is not dead and begins sobbing. The film ends with a shot of the Myers' house and the sound of Michael breathing heavily behind his mask.Michael Myers, the legendary man who came home on Halloween night to kill, is still alive somewhere out there..."

Foul Play,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077578/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A San Francisco librarian picks up a hitchhiker whose car has broken down, which leads to her being stalked and hunted by shady individuals. A cop she briefly met during a function eventually comes to her rescue. When, unbeknownst to Gloria, a microfilm cassette is left with her by a dying agent, she becomes entangled in a complicated series of events. She's pursued by a dwarf and an albino, and becomes convinced that they are out to kill her. Finally, with the help of San Francisco detective Tony Carlson, she begins to turn the tables on her pursuers. It becomes clear that the nerfarious crew after her are plotting a dastardly deed indeed - to assassinate the Pope as he visits the city to see _The Mikado_. Gloria and Tony must race against time to prevent this terrible crime.—Rick Munoz <rick.munoz@his.com> Ever since coming out of a failed marriage, San Francisco librarian Gloria Mundy has lived a reclusive life with no romance on the horizon. Encouraged by her friends who think she should start dating again, Gloria picks up a stranded motorist along the highway, he named Bob 'Scotty' Scott. The two make a date for later that evening. At that date in a dark movie theater, Scotty, with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, tells Gloria among other things that there's going to be a murder and to ""beware of the dwarf"", after which he dies. But before she can call in the authorities, Scotty's dead body goes missing with no one in the theater having seen him either dead or alive. As Gloria nervously wonders what is happening, a series of people including a dwarf, an albino, a Turkish looking man, and a man with a scar on his face, are chasing her seemingly wanting to kill her. All the while, she keeps on encountering this nervous little English-accented man who wants Gloria for another reason. The police are finally called in after a break-in at her apartment, where she thinks she's killed the man with the scar on his face. When SFPD Detectives Tony Carlson and 'Fergie' Ferguson arrive on the scene, they find Gloria unconscious with no dead body in sight. Despite both detectives thinking that her ramblings are pure hallucinations, Tony, attracted to her, decides to be Gloria's protector. But as more and more happens to Gloria, the mystery behind Scotty and his death becomes clearer. Scotty's death is only one element in a plot more vast than either Gloria, Tony or Fergie could have imagined.—Huggo Gloria Mundy (Goldie Hawn) is attending a party in a town across the bay from San Francisco. From a conversation with a friend we learn that she is recently divorced and is shying away from dating men to avoid getting her heart broken again. Her friend urges her to become more social and for a few seconds she considers getting to know a stranger at the party played byChevy Chase. Deciding he is a klutz and a bore she drives back to the city alone. As the opening credits roll we see her driving down the gorgeous Marlin County coastline in her yellow VW convertible asBarry Manilowsings the song ""Ready to Take a Chance Again.""When Gloria passes a handsome stranded stranger with broken down car, she decides to take a chance and pulls over to help. The stranger, Bob Scott (Bruce Solomon) asks her to drive him back to the city. On the way Scott notices that they are being followed by a black limo and decides to slip a cigarette pack, containing a spool of film, into Gloria's purse asking her to meet him at a movie theater later that evening. When she drops him off, we see two men jump from the limo and pursue him.When Scott finally reaches the movie theater, he sits down and we see he is hurt and bleeding badly. He dies shortly after whispering to Gloria ""Beware of the dwarf!"" She runs from the theater and gets the manager, but by the time they get back to her seat, the body is gone.Gloria tells this story to her elderly landlord Mr. Hennessey (Burgess Meredith), a retired anthropologist who keeps a ten foot snake as a pet, then heads upstairs to go to bed. The next day when she goes to work at the public library she also tells this story to her girlfriend, Stella, (Marilyn Sokol) who is convinced the whole thing is a hoax by a sex-crazed man, and insists the Gloria protect herself by carrying a portable alarm and a can of mace in her purse.As she is closing up the library that evening Gloria finds herself alone with an albino stranger (William Frankfather) who tries to kidnap her. She flees the building with the albino and another swarthy character, The Turk (Ion Teodorescu) in pursuit. Running into a bar she picks up Stanley Tibbets (Dudley Moore) and without telling him whats going on, asks him to take her to his apartment. There, Stanley misreads her intentions and prepares for a wild evening of sex, while she is distracted watching her pursuers out the window. When she finally turns around and sees Stanley in his underwear she is shocked and he is embarrassed. She heads home while Stanley mutters his apologies.Gloria is later assaulted at her apartment by a man with a scar on his face (Don Calfa), who demands she give him whatever was passed to her by Scott. He takes the cigarettes, and then attempts to strangle Gloria, but she stabs him with a pair of knitting needles (The cigarettes fall out of his pocket and lay hidden under a plant). Thinking she has killed him she calls the police, but as she turns around he is up again staggering toward her with murderous intent. The albino suddenly appears at the window and uses a throwing knife to kill the man with the scar and Gloria faints.She awakes to see the face of Chevy Chase's character, who we find is police Lt. Tony Carlson. Gloria tells him her story, but again the body has disappeared. Carlson's partner, Fergie, (Brian Dennehy) thinks she is nuts, but Tony is attracted to her and invites her to the station during her lunch hour.When she leaves the library to meet Tony for lunch she is kidnapped by the albino and the Turk. Waking up locked in a room she uses the portable alarm to get the Turk into the room and then maces him. She then climbs down the fire escape in the pouring rain and jumps to safely. Later she shows up at Tony's office, soaked to the skin and he takes her home.The next day Tony and Fergie check out the room where Gloria was held and find out that it was rented to someone named ""Stiltskin."" When Tony gets back to police headquarters he is informed that Stiltskin is the name of an assassin whose nickname is the ""The Dwarf"" and Scott was working undercover trying to find the name of the target. Suddenly Gloria's strange story makes sense and Tony heads out to her apartment to make sure she is okay.In the meanwhile Gloria has a visit from salesman J.J. MacKuen (Billy Barty). As he is a midget, she is terrified and misunderstanding his offer to connect her with eternity pushes him out the window, where he falls into a trash barrel and goes rolling down the hilly San Francisco street. When Tony arrives they open MacKuen's case to find he was an innocent Bible salesman.Gloria, Tony and Fergie head out to the residence of Archbishop Thorncrest, whose limo has been identified as the one used in kidnapping Gloria. The Archbishop (Eugene Roche) and his assistant Delia Darrow (Rachel Roberts), are busy preparing for a visit by the Pope and claim the car has been missing, taken by the chauffer, The Turk. When Gloria and party leave we find out that the Archbishop has been replaced by his identical brother. He and Darrow, Stiltskin, the albino and the Turk are part of an anti-religious conspiracy to kill the Pope.To keep Gloria safe Tony takes her to his house overnight: a fancy houseboat in Sausalito where they become romantically involved. The next day he takes Gloria home where Fergie is supposed to keep an eye on her while Tony heads out to look at where they found scarface's body. Fergie never shows up at Gloria's but she gets a mysterious call from him asking her to meet him at a deserted building next to a ""massage"" parlor. Stiltskin (Marc Lawrence) and company have kidnapped Fergie and forced him to make the call to trap Gloria. At the last moment Fergie yells a warning and Gloria escapes into the massage parlor hiding in one of the rooms where she again runs into Stanley. Stanley is mortified, but Gloria begs him to call the police and have the house raided. He finally does this, but Gloria is captured anyway while Stanley is hauled off to the police station.When Gloria and Fergie disappear, Tony decides to search the Archbishop's house with the help of Mr. Hennessey. Tony finds Fergie in the basement and a fight erupts between him and Stiltskin were Stiltskin is killed. Tony is captured and taken upstairs where he is tied up with Gloria. The archbishop imposter informs them that even with Stilskin dead, the albino, the backup assassin, will do the job by shooting the Pope from one of the organ bays during that evening's opera. Mr. Hennessey suddenly attacks and the archbishop imposter is knocked cold as a martial arts contest unfolds between the elderly Hennessey and the middle-aged Delia Darrow with the tied up Tony and Gloria watching. Hennessey finally wins and Tony and Gloria are released to make a hair raising race across the city (wrecking several vehicles in the process) to the opera house.They check the first organ bay and it seems empty, so Tony leaves Gloria there while he and the other police leave to check the other side. The albino comes out from where he has been hiding, however, and kidnaps Gloria, dragging her up into the catwalks above the stage while the opera continues below. The albino manages to shoot a pursuing policeman who tumbles over the edge and gets caught in the rigging of a sailing ship ""flying"" setpiece in the rafters of the theater. The albino is then shot by Tony, falls and is caught in the same way. The set suddenly drops down out of the ceiling at the end of the opera with the two dead men caught in the rigging. The whole theater sits in shock at this until the Pope, apparently thinking this is the way the opera is supposed to end, starts clapping and everybody else joins in. Tony and Gloria find each other and embrace while the crowd cheers. Down the orchestra pit we see the conductor is Stanley, who blanches at seeing Gloria, and slips on a pair of sunglasses hoping to avoid another embarrassing encounter with her."
Up in Smoke,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078446/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two stoners unknowingly smuggle a van - made entirely of marijuana - from Mexico to L.A., with incompetent Sgt. Stedenko on their trail. Cheech and Chong meet up by chance on the highway somewhere in California. They go in search of some dope and are accidentally deported to Mexico where in their desperation to get home they agree to drive a van back to the States so they can get back in time for a gig they are due to play. Unaware of the properties from which the van is constructed they make their way back having acquired a couple of female hitch-hikers whilst all the time avoiding the cops whom they are not even aware are following them.—Garry 'Gadget' Myles <garry.myles@mercury.co.uk> Two directionless musicans, a Chicano guitarist (Cheech Marin) and a White drummer (Tommy Chong), meet up in a chance encounter and embark on a series of odd adventures, including being the unwitting partcipants of a bizarre marijuana smuggling plot.—Baroque (gopher_baroque@hotmail.com) In California, jobless hippie and stoner Anthony ""Man"" Stoner (Chong) is kicked out of his house by his rich and classy father. He drives off in his fathers car, which breaks down, and Anthony is left stranded near a beach, left to sleep in a ditch over night with his belongings.The next morning, Chicano stoner Pedo De Pacas (Cheech) sets off from his Mexican-family-house in his lowrider car looking for love with errands to run. Pedro drives along the beach where he tries to pick up ladies, and sees Anthony with melons stuffed under his shirt. Assuming that Anthony is a large-breasted woman, Pedro drives his car around and tries to pick ""her"" up, only to be horrified when he discovers Anthony is just a guy looking for a ride.Feeling bad (and liking that Anthony likes his car), Pedro gives Anthony a ride, just missing being caught by the police. While driving, the 2 take a liking to each other being that they both like smoking marijuana. Pedro offers Anthony a small joint, while Anthony shows Pedro a huge joint, made out of dog feces (being that the dog ate Anthony's stash). The 2 smoke the joint and get incredibly high, followed by Pedro accidentally swallowing a lot of acid. The car crashes into a light pole, and the 2 are arrested and the car towed away. In a small courtroom trial, the 2 are being prosecuted when Anthony, still high, begs for water. Pedro grabs some of the judge's ""water"" for Anthony, only to have Anthony spit it out, revealing it to actually be vodka. With the judge taken away, Pedro and Anthony are let off free.The next morning, after Anthony meets (and argues) with Pedro's band (being that Pedro is a guitarist/singer and Anthony is a drummer), the 2 set off to score some weed. However, the town is dry being that many people are smoking pot these days. The 2 visit Pedro's cousin Strawberry, who is a retired war veteran who is a little messed up in the head and has a large ""birth mark"" on his face. Anthony stays in Strawberry's messy apartment while Pedro and Strawberry go off on a motorcycle to get weed. While in the apartment, Anthony meets Strawberry's roommate, a cokehead who throws a large drug party in the apartment. Meanwhile, Strawberry has a war flash and loses his mind and jumps off the motorcycle, sending Pedro crashing. When he crashes, he sees cops hiding outside the apartment, ready to bust in and arrest the druggies at the party. Pedro tries to warn Anthony via phone, which is bugged, and the party is busted. Pedro infiltrates the bust dressed like a re-po man, claiming he's there to reposses the stuff. The cops buy the story, and Pedro rescues Anthony.After that, the 2 visit Pedro's friends' place where the 2 get stoned, but not so much being that the weed is bad. At that point, immigration busts in, being that Pedro's friends calling immigration on themselves to get a free ride to a wedding in Mexico. Of course, Pedro and Anthony, despite their efforts to hide, get caught and deported to Tijuana as well.While in Tijuana, Pedro calls his uncle and gets the address of a upholestry shop and arranges to pick up a van to drive back to America. But after getting fast food over the address, the 2 arrive at the wrong place- an upholestry shop which is actually a marijuana plant in disguise. The factory actually makes materials out of solid and liquid marijuana, which is then smuggled across the border. The marijuana-made things made there are worth up to $9 million, and is heavily watched by police, led by Sargeant Stedanko. Pedro and Anthony show up to the factory, unaware of what it really is, and say they're there to pick up ""the van"". Rather than getting an actual van, the stoners get a huge green van, made from marijuana, top to bottom. From the steering wheel, the tires, the doors, the gas tank, to the very structure of the van itself, its all made of pure solid and liquid marijuana- and the guys have no idea they're smuggling it into America.The stoners drive their marijuana van to the border where they're stopped by police. Anthony is smoking a joint, which he throws out the window into the window of a car full of nuns. Pedro and Anthony are almost caught, when the police discover the joint in the nuns' car. The car is taken away and the nuns searched and arrested by Sgt. Stadenko and his police officers. Unaware of what they did, the hippies drive through the border back into America in their van, stopping at the border patrol station so Anthony can use the restroom. In the restroom, Anthony pees next to Stadenko and accidentally ""shakes himself dry"" on the sargeant's leg before leaving.
An angry chief leaves the bathroom to have the officers tell him that they were wrong about the nuns, its actually 2 hippies in a big green van. Realizing who Anthony must've been and the green van was completely ignored, Sgt. Stadenko and 3 officers get in the police car and set off on the roads after Pedro and Anthony.It isn't long before the cops get sight of the marijuana van being driven by a Chicano and a hippie. They speed up, only for Pedro to get view of 2 hitch-hiking young ladies. He swerves the van across the highway, causing for the police to accidentally shoot the tires off their own police car. Pedro and Anthony (who have no idea cops are pursuing them), pick up the hitch-hikers and drive off. Pedro and one of the hitch-hikers make out in the back while Anthony drives with the other hitch-hiker. Meanwhile, Stadenko has fixed the tires and has continued the search, having no idea where the stoners could've gone.Pedro and Anthony learn from the hitch-hikers that they are actually heading for a battle of the bands concert in Los Angeles, with the winners getting a record contract. Excited, Pedro and Anthony decide to go to the battle of the bands with the ladies and compete. But first, they need to stock up on some weed. The 4 stop the green van at a police station, where a stoner female cop goes to get the 2 ladies illegal marijuana. Pedro and Anthony use this time to play with the intercom and police transmitter, taunting Sgt. Stadenko over the radio. At this point, Stadenko is really upset and he and his cops show up at the station. Stadenko goes to use the bathroom, where Pedro is. Pedro too ""shakes himself dry"" upon Stadenko's leg as Anthony did earlier and leaves, making Stadenko angrier.Pedro and Anthony and the girls, acquired with weed, return to the marijuana-made van and head on to the road again to Los Angeles. However, unknown to the 4, the gas coming out of the van is pure marijuana smoke, getting anyone who inhales really high. This occurs at the police station where someone near the van gets high and a case of the munchies, ordering multiple hamburgers from a nearby fast-food stand. While they drive along the highway, the smoke from the van spreads out the exhaust pipe, getting all driving by with their windows down really high. At one point, a police officer on a motorcycle speeds after them, but inhales the smoke and gets high, and forgets what he's doing. Pedro, Anthony, and the women get away, but the high cop is found by Stadenko, and, while high, reveals where the marijuana van headed off to, and Stadenko follows after the van.The van soon arrives in Los Angeles to the Roxy Theater where the battle of the bands takes place. Pedro and Anthony head into the theater and enter the competition, leaving the ladies behind. While inside getting ready, Anthony isn't feeling good so he takes some pills given to him by the hitchhikers- which turns out to be acid. Anthony slowly gets high, and the smoke from the van enters the vents backstage and gets both Pedro and Anthony very high as they prepare to go on. As a result, Pedro dresses in a pink tutu and a Minnie Mouse bow, while Anthony dresses in a red quaalude.Meanwhile, outside, Stadenko and crew have found the theater, and try to get inside, but are shooed off by real police men, being that they've left their badges in the car and don't have tickets. The van is almost towed away and Stadenko tries to take the van, but is denied the right to have it taken away. A billion dollar bust, gone. Stadenko and the cops hang around the van waiting for Pedro and Anthony, but get high off the smoke, and Stadenko is soon turned into a huge stoner (as seen in the movie Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams) as the van burns down into nothing but marijuana smoke, getting everyone in Los Angeles really high.Back in the theater, it is Pedro and Anthony's turn to go on. The van has nearly burned down and all the smoke entering the vents has gotten everyone in the theater high. The 2 go on stage, really high from the van smoke, and almost knock over the band equipment. The 2 then play their rock song ""Earache My Eye"" (an actual song on a Cheech and Chong record), about a gay boy trying to live his life. The song is a big smash (even though Pedro had just written it and sang it as he went on), and Pedro and Anthony win the contest and the record deal, although still very high.Days later, Pedro and Anthony are back in California from their whole drugged-up adventure, driving in Pedro's lowrider on the street next to the beach where they first met. They're happy, talking about their new record deal and all the possibilities that can happen, when they decide to smoke some hash. Anthony smokes some and hands it to Pedro, who accidentally drops it in his crotch. Pedro's crotch starts burning up and he freaks out as he and Anthony try to put it out. The car crashes as the hash starts burning up, and Pedro and Anthony (Cheech and Chong), their car, and the record contract are all left, well, up in smoke."
Midnight Express,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077928/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Billy Hayes, an American college student, is caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey and thrown into prison. On October 6, 1970 while boarding an international flight out of Istanbul Airport, AmericanBilly Hayes(Brad Davis) is caught attempting to smuggle two kilos of hashish out of the country, the drugs strapped to his body. He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who sold him the hashish. Billy's troubles really begin when after that assistance, he makes a run for it and is recaptured. He is initially sentenced to just over four years for possession, with no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard named Hamidou (Paul L. Smith) ruling the prison, he who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners for whatever reason. Told to trust no one, Billy does befriend a few of the other inmates, namely fellow American Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid) (in for stealing two candlesticks from a mosque), a Swede named Erich (Norbert Weisser), and one of the senior prisoners having already served seven years, an Englishman named Max (Sir John Hurt), the latter two also in for hashish-related charges. One prisoner not befriended is Rifki (Paolo Bonacelli), who wields power in the prison as the unofficial eyes and ears for the guards. As Billy, his family and his girlfriend Susan (Irene Miracle) attempt through legal and diplomatic channels for Billy's release, Max tells him that the only way out is to ""catch the midnight express"" (escape), which is what Jimmy is continually trying to do. When Billy's situation changes, he becomes more desperate in every sense of the word. It seems as if Billy has only two options: to let the prison ultimately figuratively then literally kill him, or to somehow regain control of his life through whatever means available.—Huggo Istanbul, Turkey, 6 October 1970. With nearly two kilos of hashish blocks strapped to his torso, American college studentBilly Hayesfinds himself sentenced to four years for smuggling drugs. As the helpless young inmate tries to get used to the cruel reality within the thick walls of the impenetrable prison, Billy struggles to complete his full sentence by enduring unspeakable abuse. But faced with unmet promises and Ankara's grave need for a scapegoat, Hayes' only hope of survival is one last appeal. This, or catch the Midnight Express.—Nick Riganas On October 6, 1970, American college studentBilly Hayesis caught attempting to smuggle drugs out of Turkey. The Turkish courts decide to make an example of him, sentencing him to more than thirty years in prison. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard named Hamidou ruling the prison, he who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners for whatever reason. Hayes has two opportunities for release: the appeals made by his lawyer, his family, and the American government, or the ""Midnight Express"".—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> This movie is based loosely on Billy Hayes' book Midnight Express about his five year experience in the Turkish prison system. The movie was exaggerated for dramatic effect.October 6, 1970. Opening scene has a xenophobic soundtrack of machine guns, Muslim prayer cries, and synthesizer music and a glimpse of Istanbul, Turkey during twilight with shots of the Bosphorus Strait, a mosque, and the downtown area with seagulls flying about. It is portrayed as a very spooky, forbidding place.While finishing up on his vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is in his hotel room and straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body. The film's soundtrack consists of an increasing heartbeat.Billy is at the airport, nervous at being caught smuggling, goes to the washroom to wet his face and attempt to relax himself, and makes his way with his girlfriend, Susan (Irene Miracle), through customs. Billy perspires heavily, noticed by the middle aged, chain-smoking customs agent who checks his bag. After his bags are searched, both Billy and Susan board a shuttle bus to their plane. Billy smiles and is relieved thinking he is out of danger. However, as the bus pulls up to the plane, he notices that a large detachment of armed police and soldiers have taken up positions just outside the plane. Unable to detach and discard the hashish, and sweating heavily, Billy is arrested on the spot when he is frisked by a young Turkish policeman and his comrades, who immediately point their guns at Billy, thinking he may be dangerous. Billy is taken away and back to security and searched, his bags being thoroughly searched and all items such as cigarettes, camera film, and toothpaste are searched and destroyed. He is forced to stand around in his underwear. Afterward, the Turkish security chief of the airport makes Billy stand for several press photographs of him holding the confiscated drugs with the smiling customs officers and then slaps them around after Billy reveals more hash in his boots they didn't find.A little later, Billy is forced to stand naked with the customs officers staring and grinning at him and an unidentified southern American man (Bo Hopkins), presumably an agent with the DEA, walks in. (Note: the mysterious American is never named, but Billy refers to him as 'Tex' due to his strong Texan accent.) ""Tex"" is calm and kind with Billy and takes him to a local police station where he is is interrogated where Tex translates for a local Turkish detective whom offers Billy freedom if he points out who sold him the hash.Tex takes Billy downtown the next morning to the bazaar where he claims to have purchased the hashish and tells Billy that recent terrorist airline hijackings have made the Turks much more fanatical about airport security and that the potency or type of drug that Billy was caught with doesn't matter: the Turkish government wants to appear tough on smuggling. Billy is at the restaurant that seems to be a popular place with young American hippies where the sale happened and tries to run from his security escort. He is quickly caught by Tex himself, whose previously friendly attitude suddenly changes for the worse as he his holding a gun to his head.During his first night in holding, Billy has his hair cut short and is put into a filthy cell by a trustee, Rifki, (Paolo Bonacelli) whom refuses to give him a blanket for warmth because he's not selling any at the time, then sneaks out of his tiny cell and takes a blanket in storage. He is later rousted out of his cell by the trustee and taken to a large guard named Hamidou (Paul L. Smith), the chief of guards, who takes him to another filthy room, the basement, trusses Billy's ankles in the air and hits the soles of his feet repeatedly with his club for stealing the blanket. Billy's feet swell immensely and he is left in horrific pain.The next morning, a small group of prisoners, Jimmy (Randy Quaid), a towering and hot-tempered American, and Erich, a kindly Swede, get him on his feet and walking (they tell him his feet will continue to swell and his recovery will be longer if he doesn't move around). Jimmy was sentenced for attempting to rob a mosque and Erich was busted for smuggling about 100 grams of hash and given a 12-year sentence. Jimmy is quite sure Billy will receive a stiff sentence, but Erich remains optimistic that he just needs a good lawyer. Jimmy shows Billy around how to navigate the minefield of the prison and, being a foreigner, not to trust any of the Turks, especially the children there who rat out prisoners to Hamidou. The prison resembles an old barracks from the 1800's.Billy is introduced to Max (John Hurt), is a bespectacled, introverted, unkempt, 30-something junkie uninterested in small talk that injects himself with ""gastro"" a stomach medicine with codeine. Max has been in prison the longest for drug dealing (seven years and counting), while Erich has already served four years and Jimmy around three. Billy and Erich are conversing with him to get a lawyer and Max is in a haze telling Billy about the Turkish justice system and that all Turkish lawyers are crooked and that he just needs to escape the best way he knows how, catching the ""Midnight Express"", a train that doesn't stop at the prison. He refers to him a lawyer named Yesil that got off a Frenchman for smuggling 200 kilos.A few weeks later, Billy's father (Mike Kellin) arrives and embraces him, forgiving his mistake and introduces him to Stanley Daniels (Michael Ensign) of the American Consulate and his requested lawyer Yesil to defend him. Yesil is a fat, shifty, greasy-haired, chain-smoking, ever-smiling man with gold teeth that promises Billy to get him the right court and judge and not to worry. Their goal is to get bail for Billy and a fake passport to get him across to Greece to leave.Billy appears before a local Turkish court in front of a panel of three judges to hear his case. But Billy's shifty and uninterested lawyer does little to combat the charges brought by an angry prosecutor, who wants Billy charged with more than possession: If Billy is charged with smuggling over mere possession, his sentence will be heavier. After the three judges deliberate for an uncertain amount of time, Billy is sentenced to serve a prison term of four years and two months for possession of hashish at the Sagmalcilar Prison. Billy and his father appear devastated while his defense lawyer argues that it is a good thing because the judges (sympathetic to Billy) turned down the prosecutor's request to convict Billy for smuggling or impose a life sentence in order to make an example of him. Billy's father gives him a care package of snacks, cigarettes, writing paper, toiletries, and loses his temper that he's unable to get him out of prison. He warns Billy not to do anything stupid and that they can play with his sentence. They tearfully depart.Over the next several months, Billy slowly adjusts to prison life. Jimmy gets stabbed in the behind for treating a Turkish prisoner badly during a volleyball game. Another time later, Billy and others witness the prison warden beat four of the young boys on their soles of their feet, believing them to have raped a new young inmate, with the warden's two pudgy sons looking on and him warning them about what happens if they ever break the law.Billy is also given the truth about Rifki, the trustee, who informs on other prisoners for unheard-of privileges and favors and has a special distaste for foreigners. Rifki also sells watery tea, low-grade hashish, steals from his fellow inmates, and seems to have an unlimited (for incarceration) supply of money to bribe the poorly paid guards. When Max offends Rifki, the informant kills Max's pet cat.In June of 1972, Billy meets with his lawyer Yesil again with Yesil assuring him of convincing Turkish officials to lose his records before the high court in Ankara can review his case for the right amount of money. Billy is bored and uninterested at Yesil's visit, feeling it's all empty promises.Jimmy shows Billy and Max blueprints to the prison of catacombs. They believe they can access them through a wall in the kitchen and go underneath or simply climbing over the wall. Max dismisses Jimmy's idea as foolish and Billy does not want to risk trying to escape fearing that if he's caught it will add time to his sentence. An angry Jimmy decides to go ahead with it himself, being caught and badly beaten with a leather strap by Hamidou and sent to the sanitarium.In June of 1974, Billy's friend, Erich, is granted transfer to prison in his home country, more than likely leaving there after a short term because of Sweden's lenient laws, and leaves the prison after serving around eight years. Billy farewells with him and marks down his prison time to 53 days.After almost four years in the prison, Billy is informed that his case will be reviewed again. Thinking he's being let go early for good behavior, Billy rushes to meet with Stanley Daniels, the representative from the US ambassador's office in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. However, Daniels has bad news; the High Court in the Turkish capital of Ankara has heard a different argument from the prosecutor who has appealed the four-year term verdict, and is seeking to charge Billy with smuggling hashish and make an example of him. Since double-jeopardy law does not exist in Turkey like it does in the US, any accused can be tried more then once for the same crime on appeal or should new evidence surface.At another courtroom hearing, a distraught Billy rails against the three judges, the prosecutor, his own lawyer, the Turkish legal system, and the nation of Turkey itself. Speaking through a translator, with a mixture of anger and pity in his voice, the chief judge tells Billy that his hands are tied by Ankara and has no choice but to give him a life sentence. Billy is given a minimum sentence of 30 years, with time already served, for smuggling of hashish.A saddened Billy sits in his cell with a sense of hopelessness that night, but now wants to go forward with Jimmy's original plan of escape. The stones used as walls in their section's kitchen are cemented in place with mortar that has weakened greatly in the dank conditions. Jimmy, Billy and Max discover two such stones and are able to remove them, finding a shaft behind them that leads to a system of flooded catacombs under the prison. The three of them spend two nights and hours searching for an escape route. However, once they do go underneath, it turns out the Turks have long since blocked off every tunnel. The three give up and replace the stones.Rifki finds their secret in the kitchen the next morning after their unsuccessful escape attempt and immediately tells Hamidou. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible after what happened the first time and drags him off for punishment again, and is never seen from then on.Billy and Max figure out a revenge scheme: they find Rifki's stash of hidden money and destroy it by burning part and boiling the other part. In retaliation, a raid is performed by Hamidou and Rifki plays a charade with Hamidou and frames Max for hashish possession. Hamidou has Max dragged off for punishment like Jimmy was. Billy loses it after all he's been through and savagely attacks Rifki in the washroom, chasing and beating the traitor until he bites out the man's tongue out. Billy is taken away by guards, beaten, and sent to the prison's insane asylum.In October 1975, Billy has now been reduced to a catatonic and unkempt shadow of his former self in the prison's ward for the insane where he wanders in a daze among the other disturbed and catatonic prisoners, many of which look mentally incapacitated. His activities seem to consist solely of walking in a circle around a pillar with other prisoners. Max is running from guards for an unknown infraction and is grabbed by Hamidou and thrown across the place and severely injured. One day a prisoner, named Ahmet, a convicted child rapist and college-educated philosopher tries to talk to him about ""bad machines"" to no avail.A group of men are doing their morning Muslim prayers and the guards hit the inmates with their sticks waking them up out of bed. Billy is hit, howls out of sleep, and horrified, making it evident he is suffering badly from PTSD.After five years, Billy is visited by Susan, who tells him that US senators are trying to work on his case to get him out, pleads with him to put himself together and get out of there unless he wants to die, and passes him a photo album of his family and tells him it has a picture of his ""good friend, Mr. Franklin, from the bank"". Susan, feeling devastated at Billy's horribly bedraggled state, also opens her blouse so Billy can masturbate. A guard takes him away, leaving Susan even more devastated.The next morning, Billy is walking the pillar in the opposite direction, which is forbidden in the Muslim code. Ahmet meets him telling him it's wrong that a good Muslim always walks right. His words seem restore some of Billy's sanity and Billy tells him that he himself is the man that makes the machines. Ahmet walks away horrified.Billy goes into the filthy sanatorium washroom and inspects the album closely, finding numerous $100 bills hidden inside the cover lining totaling around $2,000 in cash. He passes by an almost dead Max to hold on and stay alive that he's leaving and will come back for him. Max wakes up and is somewhat conscious.Billy sees Hamidou taking a restraining belt off a now dead inmate and about to leave. He approaches Hamidou with part of the money and tries to bribe his longtime enemy to take him to the sanitarium that Jimmy had spoken about where the guards are more lax in their duties. Hamidou accepts Billy's bribe but drags Billy past the entrance to the sanitarium, to a large dressing room filled with guard uniforms and with pegs set into the walls. Hamidou beats Billy, yells about how he's fed up with him, and attempts to rape him when Billy suddenly rushes Hamidou and pushes him forcefully backwards. Hamidou, flailing and trying to regain his footing, slams into the wall, driving a clothes peg into the back of his head, dying instantly. For a short time, Billy considers shooting the dead man with his sidearm but decides not to.Billy dresses himself in a guard's uniform and reclaiming his money, walks through the prison unnoticed to the front door. As he walks down the stairs, another guard stops him and throws him the keys to the door telling him (in Turkish) to remember to lock up when he checks out. Billy walks out to the street, slowing down only briefly when a police jeep rushes past him. He runs away, the frame freezing on him as he takes a victorious leap.A title card tells us that on the night of October 4, 1975, Billy was able to cross the Turkish border into Greece and flew home to the United States three weeks later. The final shots of the film before the closing credits show Billy reuniting with his family and Susan. In the original version, it was stated after having shown the movie to the Cannes film festival, there was a demand for exchange of prisoners in Turkey to be brought to America."

The first remake of the paranoid infiltration classic moves the setting for the invasion from a small town to the city of San Francisco and starts as Matthew Bennell notices that several of his friends are complaining that their close relatives are in some way different.

He puts it down to mass hysteria until two other of Matthew's friends, Jack and Nancy Bellicec, discover a partly formed corpse. They soon discover that humans are being replaced with exact copies who are emotionless and are moving forward apparently unstoppable, in their quest to replace everyone.—garykmcd In San Francisco, deputy inspector Matthew Bennell and microbiologist Elizabeth Driscoll are friends and colleagues in the food division of the county's Department of Public Health. One day, Elizabeth notices that her live-in dentist boyfriend, Dr. Geoffrey Howell, is acting strangely, almost like his being has been taken over by someone else. She begins to see this strange behavior in many others, and discovers Geoffrey meeting with like-behaving people she doesn't know, leading her to believe that there is some sort of conspiracy happening. She tries to convince Matthew that something is going on, he looking for some rational explanation into what he also sees, in the process consulting his celebrity psychiatrist friend, Dr. David Kibner, who attributes such behavior to something best treated in couples' counseling. Matthew is forced to admit that something other worldly is happening when he sees evidence of such provided to him by his struggling writer friend Jack Bellicec and Jack's mud bath owner wife, Nancy Bellicec. Matthew not only has to try now to convince others of what he saw but also figure out what exactly is happening to be able to stop it. If Matthew and Elizabeth are unable to do either, the consequence may be the human race being taken over by these other worldly beings. In the process, they also have to learn who they can or cannot trust, as some people may already have changed like Geoffrey without them knowing.—Huggo The employee of the Department of Public Health, Elizabeth Driscoll, tells his friend and coworker, the field investigator Matthew Bennell, that her boyfriend Dr. Geoffrey Howell is not the same person - he is behaving differently.

He breaks in her house and finds a clone of her. The quartet discovers that people are being replaced by exact emotionless replicas using plants that get them when they sleep.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil On an unidentified planet, a strange lifeform in the shape of gel-like spores drifts up into the atmosphere, where it moves slowly through space, drifting until it reaches Earth. The spores enter the atmosphere and are swept downward, emerging in a rainstorm in San Francisco. On the ground, the spores begin to develop, growing on leaves of earthly plants and taking the shape of small pods with a pink flower in the middle.Elizabeth Driscoll (Brooke Adams) notices one of the pods, taking it back to the home she shares with her boyfriend, Geoffrey (Art Hindle). Unable to find the flowering pod in any of her botany books, she hesitantly identifies her new find as a cross-breeding of two different species, a ""grex.""Matthew Bennell (Donald Sutherland) is an inspector for the health department who uncovers unsanitary conditions at a French restaurant. As he threatens the owner with indictment over finding rat droppings in the food, the other employees quietly slip out to the parking lot and smash Matthew's windshield with a bottle of wine. Matthew is cold and calculating, refusing to let them see his frustration at finding his car vandalized, but when he gets home he calls Elizabeth. They work together at the health department, and Matthew jokes with her about what happened to him at the restaurant. As Elizabeth goes to bed, she forgets about the weird pod, which has suddenly sprouted roots in the glass of water she keeps it in next to their bed.When Elizabeth wakes the next morning, Geoffrey is already awake and dressed, cleaning up the remains of the glass of water next to the bed, as well as some other, unidentifiable mess (resembling some kind of dust). His behavior is strange, and she follows him downstairs as he takes a plastic garbage bag out to a waiting dump truck. At work, she confides to Matthew that Geoffrey is acting strange. Later that night, Elizabeth tries to talk it over with Geoffrey but he ignores her, instead telling her that he's going out and giving her no explanation. Elizabeth touches him intimately and recoils from his emotionless response. Elizabeth rushes over to Matthew's house and insists that Geoffrey is no longer Geoffrey. On the outside he looks the same, but inside he is different. Matthew hears her out but calms her by cooking a good meal and letting her vent.The next day, Matthew hears a strange story from the owner of the Chinese laundry he patronizes: his wife is not his wife. Later he finds Elizabeth at the health department offices, shaken and obviously distraught. She reveals that she has been following Geoffrey during that day and has seen him having brief meetings with strangers, all of them passing unidentifiable parcels among themselves. She is convinced that there is some sort of conspiracy afoot and that Geoffrey is a part of it. Matthew wants to take her to meet his friend, a renowned psychologist named David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy). Kibner has written a number of popular books, the latest of which has just been published, and Matthew takes Elizabeth to a book signing party at a local bookstore so she can meet Kibner personally. While stopped at a traffic light, a strange man (Kevin McCarthy, the star of the original movie) suddenly falls onto Matthew's car, screaming and pounding at the windows, warning ""They're coming! Something terrible! You're in danger!"" Before they can react, another vehicle comes along and strikes the man dead. Strangely, the crowd of people around him seem to not be affected by what has happened at all, not even the motorcycle policeman who arrives on the scene. (Unnoticed by Matthew and Elizabeth, there are one or two others down the streets and sidewalks running from groups of other people chasing them.)At the book party that evening, Matthew and Elizabeth meet up with Jack Bellicec (Jeff Goldblum), a friend of Matthew's. Matthew tries to phone in a report to the police about the accident, but he meets with strange resistance. Elizabeth becomes entranced by an extremely upset woman who is insisting to Kibner that her husband is an impostor. Kibner calms the woman somewhat before sending her on her way with her husband, but Elizabeth urges the woman to contact her at the health department because she knows what she is trying to say.Finally, Matthew is able to introduce Elizabeth to Kibner, who admits that over the past few days, other people have been coming to him with the same story that Elizabeth is telling. The patients tell him that someone close to them is acting strange and seems like an impostor; the patients seem to get over it quickly and change their story. Kibner suggests that it is a result of the emotional isolation people feel in modern relationships, but even Matthew notices that Kibner doesn't seem to be listening to what Elizabeth is really saying. Matthew takes Elizabeth home and she finds a plant waiting for her; a card indicates it's a gift from Geoffrey.Jack returns to his wife, Nancy (Veronica Cartwright), who runs a mud bath facility. Jack is frustrated over not getting a chance to read his poetry at Kibner's book party, and he goes into the baths to relax. Nancy interacts with a strange patron name Mr. Gianni, who has given her a plant just like the one Geoffrey left for Elizabeth. When Nancy begins closing up for the evening, she notices someone lying under a sheet and thinks it is Jack. Removing the sheet, she is startled to find a strange form underneath. It resembles a man, but lacks distinctive features, and is covered with white tendrils. Jack, who was sleeping nearby, suddenly appears and Nancy strikes him accidentally, giving him a nosebleed, and the shape on the table begins to bleed, too. They call Matthew and urge him to come over to examine the phenomenon, and when he realizes something terribly strange is happening, he remembers Elizabeth. Unable to reach her by phone, Matthew goes over to her house, and while Geoffrey sits listening to headphones, Matthew breaks into the house and retrieves a sleeping Elizabeth from the house. Before taking her from her bed, Matthew is shocked to see a duplicate of her body lying nearby, covered in the same fibers as the body at the baths. Back at the baths, Jack falls asleep again and the body begins to take on his features, until Nancy wakes him up again.Matthew and Elizabeth return to the baths and summon Kibner, but the body has apparently vanished. Likewise, Matthew reports Elizabeth's ""other body"" to the police, but when they return to the house she shares wtih Geoffrey, nobody is able to find a body. Kibner quiets the police and Geoffrey seems unconcerned that his girlfriend refuses to come home and is spending the night with Matthew. Converging at Matthew's house, the small group forms their hypothesis: somehow, people are being duplicated, and these alternate bodies are appearing to take their places. Kibner is skeptical and tries to talk them out of their ideas, but finally leaves; unseen by the others, he gets into a car with two other ""conspirators,"" including Geoffrey.All day, Matthew tries to get others to listen to him about what's going on. He makes phone calls, has meetings, and tries to find anybody who will take him seriously. Similarly, the woman who was so upset at the bookstore turns up at the health department and tells Elizabeth that she's alright now. That night, the Bellicecs stay at Matthew's. Kibner gives Elizabeth a mild sedative to help her sleep, and leaves.The entire group falls asleep except for Nancy. As they sleep, four pods in Matthew's garden release white tendrils that attach to the sleeping people, and they soon burst forth with embryonic life, somehow duplicating their victims. Before the transformation is complete, Nancy revives Matthew. Together they wake the others, and Matthew tries to call for help. The telephone operators already know who he is, addressing him by name. The power goes out, and they see a horde of pod people rushing up the hill to Matthew's house. As the others escape out the back, Matthew leaves the yard, smashing in the head of his own duplicate with a hoe.Near the docks, the group appears to be cornered behind a group of shipping crates, but Jack sacrifices himself, rushing out along the dock and getting the pod people clones to give chase. Nancy runs off after him, and Matthew and Elizabeth are on their own. They attempt to take a taxi out of town, but the sinister looking cab driver (Don Siegel, the director of the original movie) drives them to a police roadblock that is arresting people attempting to leave the city. Matthew and Elizabeth find that they cannot escape San Francisco; the pod people are everywhere, even spreading pods right out in the open as they now apparently outnumber humans.Taking refuge in the dark offices of the health department, they find speed pills in someone's desk and take as much as they can in order to keep themselves awake. However, they are found out by none other than Jack, who has returned with Kibner, both of them pod people. Kibner gives them a sedative. He explains that they will be reborn into a new world without emotions or complications, thanks to the alien life form that has taken root on Earth, but Matthew and Elizabeth manage to overpower both of them, killing Jack and locking Kibner in a freezer.On the way out of the building, they encounter Nancy in a stairwell; she is still human. Nancy reveals that she and Jack were separated, but she has discovered a way to move among the pod people: by refusing to show emotion. The three of them leave the health department right out in the open, but Elizabeth is startled by a bizarre pod hybrid that has mutated into a dog with a human head. An elderly pod lady notices it and makes a high-pitched scream, which seems to be a way by the pod people to call out to others of a human in their mist. Nancy once again gets separated from Elizabeth and Matthew, who are identified as human (Type-H as referred by the pod people) and chased throughout the city.Making their way to the docks, Matthew and Elizabeth discover a a greenhouse where thousands of pods are being cultivated. Elizabeth, hindered by a twisted ankle and lack of sleep, feels as if she can't go on much further without sleep. Matthew goes to investigate the sounds of ""Amazing Grace"" coming from one of the ships, leaving Elizabeth hidden among some tall grass. Matthew is horrified to see huge palettes of pods being loaded onto the ships; the spiritual is simply a random radio broadcast, as the station is changed, the ship helmed by pod people ready to take the alien presence to other areas of the world.When Matthew returns to Elizabeth, he finds her asleep, and he is unable to wake her. As he holds her in his arms, Elizabeth's body crumbles into a husk, and her nude clone appears in the grass. The pod Elizabeth tells Matthew that everything is alright; the conversion is painless, and good. She encourages him to sleep, but her voice is hard and cold. Matthew runs, slipping into the greenhouse facility. He makes his way to the steep scaffolding and after taking a fire axe, beings wreaking havoc among the pods, dropping electrical lighting rigs onto them until the entire place is in flames and the unborn pods are burned. But the fire alarm is sounded, and the pod people pursue him, including the newly converted Elizabeth. Matthew slips away from them, hiding under a dock. He hears them talking amongst themselves and one of them says: ""He can't get far, he has to sleep sometime."" Matthew knows that they are right.The next day, Matthew goes through the motions of his job, staring blankly at his co-workers. He sees Elizabeth in the hallways of the building but they do not acknowledge one another. Outside, Matthew sees schoolbuses of children from Santa Barbara, L.A. and other areas of California being taken to a theater for their conversion. A while later, Matthew is walking along a deserted street towards the City Hall building and hears a voice calling to him. Turning around, he sees the still-human Nancy across the street. As she crosses the street to meet him, Matthew's face twists into a grimace and he points at her, screaming an alien scream to alert the other pod clones to her presence. Nancy screams realizing, too late, that Matthew is now a pod person as the camera zooms into his mouth and the screen fades to black...(By the time the end credits finish rolling, it is strongly implied that Nancy will be captured and become a pod clone too. Apparently there are no more humans alive in San Francisco. The inevitable has happened: the pods have won... and the rest of Earth is apparently doomed.)"

Over her father's objections, Lexie moved from her home in Waverly, Iowa to train at the legendary Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

their hometown of Heartland, they continued performing through the Roaring '20's, the Depression, and through another Great War, until the demise of the bandleader in 1958.
He left his magical instruments to the town of Heartland. These items have the power to
make dreams come true, and as long as they remained in the town's possession, humanity would live happily foreverafter. He left his wholesome grandson, Billy Shears, (Peter Frampton) his Golden Eagle and musical legacy. The town's venerable mayor,
Mr. Kite (George Burns) tells the tale of the new Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band,
consisting of Billy, his best friends, Mark, Dave, and Bob Henderson (The Bee Gees), and managed by his jealous stepbrother, Dougie Shears (Paul Nicholas).The new band debuts in their wholesome small town one sunny summer day, introduced by money-hungry Dougie. Dave, Mark, and Bob start off the performance, joined by Billy after he shares a brief moment with his sweetheart, Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina). Townsfolk of all ages instantly take to the boys, who receive a
telegram from Big Deal Records requesting a demo tape, with the promise of big success.
Mr. Kite briefly imagines himself as a superstar, performing a number in the town square,
alone except for two little girls who join his jaunty dance.The town's magical weather vane picks up a strange signal, the arrival of Mean Mr. Mustard (Frankie Howerd). His mission: to Take Over Heartland. He is apparently
directed by the FVB, who reminds him: We hate love; We hate joy; We love
money. The band is recording their demo tape at a farm near town as he arrives. Back
in Hollywood, Big Deal's B.D. Hoffler (Donald Pleasence) hears the tape and begins his plan to sign them to his label. The band is summoned to Hollywood immediately, giving Billy and Strawberry scant time for tender goodbyes. They share one night in the farm's hayloft before the band's hasty departure.Arriving in L.A. by Big Deal's private jet, the band is welcomed personally by B.D. and his
sexy assistant, Lucy (Dianne Steinberg). They are transported by stretch El Camino
to B.D.'s mansion, where the naive bandmates are immediately corrupted by liquor, drugs, and
women. Later that evening, the intoxicated boys are duped into signing B.D.'s exploitive contract. The next morning they commence recording sessions, leading to instant superstardom with sold-out concerts, intense media coverage, and enormous record sales. During their rise to success, B.D. requires Lucy and her backup singers, the Diamonds (Stargard) to control the band by exerting their evil and sexual influence.Back in Heartland, Strawberry pines for Billy while Mr. Mustard steals the magical instruments from Mr. Kite's office at City Hall. Mustard begins his mission to deliver the
instruments to various villainous characters. Without the protection of the instruments,
Heartland instantly degenerates into a den of iniquity.Strawberry leaves home in pursuit of her beloved Billy, leaving her parents heartbroken in her absence. Mr. Mustard's robots alert him and his Brute (Carel Struyken) of Strawberry's departure. When she arrives in L.A., she sees a billboard showing Billy and the rest of the band, next to
another featuring Lucy and the Diamonds. Both billboards come to life. The women's seductive performance lures the men into their embrace, horrifying the distraught Strawberry. When she momentarily turns away, the billboards return to their inanimate
states.The next day, Strawberry arrives at the band's recording session, witnessing some flirtatious glances between Billy and Lucy. B.D. and Dougie try to get rid of her, but she is able to get in and explain the treachery that has befallen Heartland. Mr. Mustard
arrives moments later, and the band accosts his van in an effort to recover the stolen
instruments. The van's computer indicates the first instrument went to Dr. Maxwell Hammer (Steve Martin), a cheerfully deranged and money-driven physician. Billy, Mark, Dave, Bob, and Strawberry make haste to Dr. Hammer's office and retrieve Sgt. Pepper's silver cornet after a non-contact fight sequence. They find the drum in the van, then seek
Father Sun (Alice Cooper) for the tuba. In his Orwellian lair, he drums the message, ""We Hate Love; We Hate Joy; We Love Money"" into the heads of militant young cadets. The band and Strawberry retrieve the tuba, but Billy is injured by an electrical shock. Back safely in the van, Strawberry lovingly tends to the unconscious Billy. He dreams of her, then revives at the sound of her beautiful singing.Mark Henderson, working at the van's computer, causes a malfunction and cannot retrieve the location of the final missing instrument. Heartland continues to deteriorate
into desperate circumstances. B.D. is forced to cancel several tour dates, but Dougie suggests a huge benefit concert to save the town.One day, as the townsfolk drudge through the town, bewildered at its delapidated state,
they are surprised by the arrival of a singing and acrobatic troupe, anchored by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band and the lovely Strawberry Fields. Mr. Kite, along with the rest of the town, is cheered at this fortunate turn of events. B.D., Dougie, and
Lucy are pleased at their business cunning in exploiting the situation for financial gain. Dougie and Lucy go into City Hall, where the day's proceeds are stored and load up a wheelbarrow with several bags of money. They transfer the money into the van's refrigerator as Earth, Wind and Fire perform the evening show for the town, Billy and the
Hendersons enjoy front-row seats. Mr. Mustard and the Brute get to town and find the
van. They kidnap Strawberry and drag her into the van, then drive off. Dougie and Lucy manage to hide in the van without being discovered. The band sees the departing van and sets off in hot pursuit via the town's hot air balloon.Mustard was headed for FVB Central with the recovered instruments where the evil genius would suppress the magical instruments and make the world safe for his legions. Unless the band could arrive first and stop them. Mustard, who has admired
Strawberry all along, attempts to woo her via serenade in her bound-and-gagged state.
Soon, the balloon comes into view, and Dougie and Lucy try to escape the van with some of their lot., They are discovered and led into FVB Central along with Strawberry,
then tied up and forced to endure a performance by FVB - Future Villain Band
(Aerosmith). Billy and the Hendersons break into the complex and wrestle FVB into submission, killing the evil genius (Steve Tyler). Unfortunately, Strawberry falls to her
death in the struggle.Back in Heartland, the cleaned-up town mourns the loss of Strawberry Fields, who lies in state in a coffin of clear glass engraved with Heartland's signature hearts. Billy, Dougie, and the Hendersons are all pallbearers. Mr. Kite questions whether it was worth the loss
in order to restore the town. Leaving the church after her service, Billy sadly walks off for
some time alone, remembering the good times he shared with Strawberry. He then attempts suicide by jumping from a rooftop. As he falls, the Heartland Weather Vane (Billy Preston) comes to life and returns him to the rooftop. Billy Shears is not only saved, but apparently cured of his depression by this surprising turn of events.The Magical Weather Vane then changes Mr. Mustard and the Brute into a bishop and a monk; Dougie and Lucy into an altar boy and a nun. Next, he brings a hale and hearty
Strawberry Fields back to life. She runs to Billy and they embrace warmly in a fairy tale ending.The townsfolk are joined by dozens of celebrity guests of 1970's fame for a rollicking and joyful finale, in a tribute to the cover of the original Beatles album that inspired the film."

The musical career of rock and roll pioneer Buddy Holly is chronicled, from the days when ""Peggy Sue"" was ""Cindy Lou"", a song about his first girlfriend, to the meteoric run of ""That'll Be the Day"" up the charts, to his marriage, breakup with the Crickets, reunion with the Crickets, and untimely death.—Jason A. Cormier <wildrose@mindspring.com> The film opens at The Buddy Holly Hayride presented by radio station KDAV in Lubbock, Texas in 1956. During the opening credits, Holly (Charles Hardin Buddy Holley's last name was misspelled on his recording contract, so he simply adopted the misspelling as his last name) and his fellow band members (The Crickets' names were changed to avoid legal action from Jerry Allison and Joe B. Mauldin. The group's rhythm guitarist, Niki Sullivan, was ignored by the film, as was the groups manager, Norman Petty), drummer Jesse Charles (Don Stroud) and bass player Ray Bob Simmons (Charles Martin Smith), set up their music instruments and test their sound equipment at Parker's Roller Rink.As the radio station prepares to broadcast live, a recording of country artist Lefty Frizzell singing ""If You've Got the Money, Honey (I've Got the Time)"" is heard on the radio. Holly's first number is a cover version of Les Paul and Mary Ford's recording of ""Mockingbird Hill."" During a commercial break, some of the younger members of the audience beg Buddy to play some bop. After the commercial Buddy Holly (Gary Busey) announces they will be performing the next number for the boppers (""Rock Around with Ollie Vee""). The youngsters enjoy it, but the older audience members cover their ears from the loud tone and one of the radio station's sponsors demands that Buddy be taken off the air or he will pull his advertising. The station's owner/disk jockey, Riley Randolph (Bill Jordan), actually thinks they sound pretty good and he likes the response from the youngsters. So, the guys perform another of their numbers, ""That'll Be the Day.""The next scene is in a church where the choir is sings ""When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder."" Buddy, his girlfriend, Cindy or Cindy Lou (Amy Johnston), and his parents are in the congregation. The minister comments on what took place the previous night at the roller rink. He declares that this new ""jungle rhythm"" music is un-Christian and un-American. As the pastor's harangue against music that he considers a threat to society continues, Buddy and his parents drive home in their pick-up truck.During Sunday dinner, Buddy discloses that he has decided not to attend seminary. His mother feels she and his father have been more than patient about his decision and have even allowed him to sow his wild oats by playing his music, but they would like to know what he plans for his future. He readily admits he has no idea.Out on a date with Cindy, they listen to rhythm and blues music (""In the Still of the Nite"" by the Five Satins) on KWKH, a radio station from Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of his band buddies interrupt Buddy and Cindy's love making session to tell Buddy that Riley is looking for him.When Buddy goes to the radio station, Riley gives him some records by several R&B artists because he can't play them on his station. Riley calls the music ""rock and roll,"" a title that he says was devised by Cleveland DJ, Alan Freed. He also tells Buddy that a vice president of World Records heard the roller rink show and wants the band to come to Nashville.On the trip to Nashville, the car radio plays ""Lisbon Antigua"" by Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra. They quickly turn the dial to find a station that plays R&B, but, when they can't find one, they turn the radio off. In the back seat of the car, Buddy plays his guitar and works on a new song using his girlfriend's name (the song eventually becomes ""Peggy Sue"").In the Nashville recording studio, Buddy records ""That'll Be the Day"" in the hillbilly style that the record producer wants. Jesse and Ray Bob furnish the background vocals, but Jesse isn't allowed to play his drums (drums weren't permitted in country music at this time) and Ray Bob isn't allowed to play bass; instead, a country band accompanies them. When Buddy finally objects, the producer tells him there ""ain't no such thing as a hit record with just three guys playin' in any kind of music."" Since the record company refuses to listen to Buddy's objections, they pack up and head home.Back in Lubbock, Buddy is ready to hang it up. Riley has had more negative feedback about Buddy's radio show from his sponsors. He tells Buddy he must only play country music or he will be forced to fire him. Buddy is determined to play his music. Before he departs, Riley tells him he sent his tape to a record company in New York (Riley had recorded a couple of tunes from the roller rink show).In New York, Coral Records executive, Ross Turner (Conrad Janis) is considering signing Buddy and his band. When the company's A&R man heard the demo of ""That'll Be the Day,"" he assumed Ross had purchased the master from another label. He thought the group had the most unique sound he had heard in years, so he had it pressed and released. The A&R guy advises Ross that he had better sign them immediately because the disc is already selling.Back in Lubbock, Buddy, Jesse and Ray Bob record ""Everyday"" in his garage. Buddy is bothered by a sound that they eventually determine is being made by a cricket. Buddy asks Ray Bob to get a glockenspiel from the high school band to use on the recording. Buddy's mother interrupts the session to tell Buddy he has a long distance call from New York.A Buffalo, New York DJ, Madman Mancuso (Fred Travalena), telephones Buddy to tell him that he has been playing his hit recording of ""That'll Be the Day"" continuously for the past fourteen hours and intends to play it until he breaks the world's record. When Mancuso asks about the instrumentation of the band, Buddy explains that it is only a guitar, bass, drums and a cricket, so the DJ calls them Buddy Holly and the Crickets.At Coral Records in New York, Buddy is very impressed with Ross Turner's secretary, Maria Elena Santiago (Maria Richwine). The band members' interest in signing a recording contract is peaked when Mr. Turner tells them they should each make about $25,000 from ""That'll Be the Day."" However, when Turner mentions assigning a top notch producer for their recordings, Buddy balks. After their previous experience with the producer in Nashville, Buddy demands to be the producer. Turner tells him that no artist is allowed to be his own producer, but when Buddy and the guys threaten to go to another record company, Ross gives in to Buddy's demand.Buddy and the Crickets are booked for a concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The short-sighted Sol Gitler (Dick O'Neill) had signed them sight-unseen and assumed from hearing their music that they were African-American. Even though no whites had ever performed at the Apollo, Gitler wasn't willing to pay them for doing nothing, so he apprehensively allows them to perform. As they prepare to go on in their country and western-looking duds, Sam Cooke (Paul Mooney) sings ""You Send Me"" from on stage. When Buddy and the Crickets are announced and the curtain opens to reveal a trio of white guys, the Apollo crowd grows restless. However, Buddy's songs, ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""It's So Easy,"" and ""Rave On,"" quickly win the crowd over. During ""Rave On"" several couples dance in the aisles.

Buddy has been sending her roses, but when he asks her out, she reveals that her aunt, who works in the publishing department, will not allow her to date a musician or a non-Puerto Rican.Back in the recording studio, Buddy and the engineers listen to the final take of ""Listen to Me."" Buddy refuses to give up on Maria, so he goes to visit her aunt. He tells Mrs. Santiago (Gloria Irricari) that he is a music executive at Coral.

Once she grants her permission, Mrs. Santiago surprises Buddy by knowing who he really is and complimenting his performance on Dick Clark's TV show, 'American Bandstand'.On their very first date, Maria accepts Buddy's marriage proposal and they are soon married (although the film doesn't show the wedding). After Alan Freed moves to New York from Cleveland, Buddy and the Crickets perform on Freed's Moondog's Rock 'n' Roll Party along with Eddie Cochran (Jerry Zaremba).

Shortly after the Sullivan show performance, Ray Bob and Jesse return to Lubbock. All three agree that the name, the Crickets, will go with them, so Buddy becomes a solo act. Turner tells Buddy he needs to go on tour to promote his new identity and his new album, but Buddy doesnt want to tour.At Christmas 1958, a neighbor boy brings a guitar he had received as a present to Buddy because, he said, it was broke. After Buddy tunes the guitar, he teaches the boy to play some chords by playing and singing ""Well, All Right."" After the boy and his friend leave, Buddy admits to Maria that he is scared to go out on the road again without the Crickets. After admitting his fears, he decides to go on the tour even though Maria is now six months pregnant.On February 2, 1959 at the Clear Lake, Iowa stop on the Winter Party Tour, J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson (Gailard Sartain), a DJ from Beaumont, Texas, performs his hit, ""Chantilly Lace."" From backstage, Buddy calls Maria to check on her and her pregnancy. Shortly after she hangs up the telephone, Jesse and Ray Bob knock on her door. They want to rejoin Buddy, but they aren't sure he wants them back. After Maria reassures them that he would welcome their return, they decide to meet Buddy at the next stop on the tour.Back in Clear Lake, the Big Bopper introduces Buddy, who sings ""True Love Ways,"" which was inspired by something Maria said to him. He dedicates the song to Maria. After that slow ballad, Buddy performs a medley containing all of his songs: ""That'll Be the Day,"" ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""Peggy Sue,"" ""Maybe Baby,"" and ""Not Fade Away.""At the end of the medley, the screen freezes on a shot of Buddy and the following statement appears on the screen: ""Buddy Holly died later that night along with J.P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson and Richie Valens in the crash of a private airplane just outside of Clear Lake... And the rest is rock 'n' roll."""
The Bad News Bears Go to Japan,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077199/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A small-time hustler takes the pint-sized baseball team to Japan for a match against the country's best Little League baseball team, sparking off a series of adventures and mishaps. With all eyes on Japan after defeating the Houston Toros inThe Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (1977), California's champions, The Bears, embark on a fascinating adventure in the far-off Land of the Rising Sun. Under the wing of the small-time Hollywood promoter, Marvin Lazar, the Bears face the country's all-star baseball team; however, nothing seems to work as planned. Now, against the backdrop of an insurmountable language barrier and an unforeseen romance, the Bears will have to prove their worth. Do they stand a chance against Japan's best little-league team?—Nick Riganas The hapless American Little League baseball team, the Bears, see the Japanese junior baseball champions on television. The Japanese team has invited Americans to play them, but no team has accepted the challenge. The Bears decide to answer the call and go on a local morning talk show to generate support.Meanwhile, local hustler and con artist Marvin P. Lazar (Tony Curtis) contemplates his debts, sees the Bears on television, and gets an idea that he later pitches to his associate, Louis the Gambler (Lonny Chapman): For $10,000, Louis can invest in Marvin's plan to take the Bears to Tokyo and broadcast the game nationally on American television. Louis declines because Marvin already owes him money. After Louis leaves, the Bears arrive to meet Marvin at his office, who falsely implies that he has already raised the money. Giving the children contracts, Marvin claims that their parents have approved and explains that he can promote the game and make them famous as both their manager and new coach. One team member, Ahmad Rahim (Erin Blunt), informs Marvin they have to take his six-year old little brother, Mustapha (Scooty Thornton), with them.Several days later, the Bears arrive in Tokyo and meet the Japanese team and their coach, Shimizu (Tomisaburô Wakayama), before proceeding to their hotel. Marvin gives the hotel two credit cards. After setting up an exhibition practice inning with the Japanese team for the next morning, Marvin tries to find a TV network to cover the event and a company willing to make an endorsement deal.At the exhibition, Marvin suggests different ways to write the Bears' story to Eddie (Jerry Ziesmer), an American television network journalist. The Bears' star player, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley), hits a home run, but the rest of his teammates play terribly and Japan scores ten runs to the Bears' one. Eddie tells Marvin that he will try to promote the game but warns that no one in the U.S. wants to see an American team get beaten.On his way back to the hotel, Kelly sees a beautiful Japanese girl (Hatsune Ishihara), and follows her to her music lesson. He approaches her afterwards but she speaks only Japanese. He follows her home and continues his attempts to communicate with the help of a Japanese-English dictionary. Kelly asks the girl to dinner and learns her name is Arika.Back at the hotel, Marvin finds it more difficult to promote the game than he anticipated and he is forced to confront his lies. Hotel management figures out that Marvin has no money, cuts up his credit cards and insists that he pay in cash. Meanwhile, the Bears realize Marvin misled them; he has not set up any games or television coverage. Disappointed, the Bears berate Marvin for lying but Mustapha says he still likes the coach.With the team stuck in Japan, Marvin is determined to make money. He bullies his way into a wrestling match with Japanese champion Antonio Inoki; although Marvin tries to dive from the wrestler, Inoki throws him around the ring. Concerned for Marvin's safety, Mustapha intercedes in the match by jumping on Inoki's back and biting his leg. The boy's teammates join in and they overcome Inoki. Marvin is declared the winner and earns enough money to cover their hotel stay. The unusual wrestling match is reported in the press and the Bears start garnering media attention.As the Bears and the Japanese team ride the train to their game location, Marvin realizes Kelly is missing. Back in Tokyo, Kelly and Arika walk around the city and get to know each other, despite the language barrier. After the two teams arrive at their destination, Shimizu observes Marvin's efforts to generate media interest and expresses disdain for Marvin's artifices despite his lack of speaking English. Later, Marvin concedes that he can be obnoxious, but argues that he doesn't want to miss out on the opportunity; if his efforts to court the media are successful, Shimizu and his team will benefit, too. When Marvin points out that he and Shimizu don't have to like each other to work together, Shimizu gives in. Shimizu and the Japanese all-stars win a nationally televised amateur talent game show and secure an endorsement deal with a baseball bat company. Meanwhile in Tokyo, Kelly and Arika share their first kiss.Sometime later, Marvin announces that the Bears are making money and presents them with new uniforms, ignoring protests that they are happy with their current outfits. As the Bears leave to watch a baseball game, Mustapha stays behind to be with Marvin, but Marvin shoos the little boy away to keep a private appointment. Marvin emerges from a massage parlor to find Mustapha waiting for him. When the boy asks Marvin why men and women kiss and how babies are made, Marvin answers as best he can.In Tokyo, Kelly finds Arika at pinball arcade and meets her disapproving father, who forces Arika to send Kelly away. Later, Ahmad calls Marvin an unscrupulous, manipulative and unfeeling ""loser,"" and Marvin considers the accusations. The next day, Marvin runs into Louis. The gambler introduces him to his boss Locke (Robert Sorrells), who is in town with three teenage baseball superstars from Texas that could play for the Bears and help them win. Louis and Locke offer to place a $5,000 bet on the Bears for Marvin in Las Vegas, Nevada; since the odds are 25 to one for the Japanese team, Marvin could make a lot of money.On game day, Marvin introduces the three Texas players, but the Bears don't want help, claiming that Marvin pushed them to be underdogs and now they have something to prove. However, Marvin wields his authority and predicts that with the Texans on the team, the Bears will win the game and be national heroes. If the Bears lose, they will get nothing. As the team heads to the dugout, Ahmad admonishes Marvin. The game begins with the Texans batting and pitching well, but the Bears shun Marvin in the dugout. When Mustapha tries to comfort him, Marvin yells at the boy to leave him alone. Soon, the Texans exhibit unsportsmanlike behaviors and a fight ensues, involving the Bears, the Japanese team and audience members. After police end the brawl, stadium officials cancel the game. However, the television network director informs Marvin he will leave the cameras rolling until 4:00 p.m., so Marvin can still get another game on the air.Learning that Shimizu left his team because the players participated in the fight, Marvin finds his fellow coach and they commiserate in a hotel, but they look out the window to see their two teams playing for fun in a neighborhood lot. The coaches join their players and everyone enjoys himself except Kelly, who is having trouble concentrating. Suddenly, Arika arrives and Kelly hits a home run. The two teenagers run into each other's arms and kiss.When the network director (George Wyner) sees the game, he insists that the players return to the stadium, adding that Marvin is contractually obligated to deliver a game, but Marvin does not consent. Although Marvin suggests that the director ask the boys directly for their approval, the man threatens to sue the coach for breach of contract. Unfazed, Marvin announces that he is done promoting and the boys cheer. Taking Shimizu aside, Marvin suggests that the teams play together in Cuba next year."
The Great Train Robbery,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079240/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"England, 1850s. A master criminal aims to rob a train of a large sum of gold. Security is incredibly tight and the task seems an impossible one. However, he has a plan and just the right people to carry it out. Sutherland and Connery wish to rob a moving train's safe in Victorian England. They need wax impressions of keys, coffins, dead cats, and a great deal of planning in order to pull it off.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1855, Edward Pierce (Sir Sean Connery) plans to do something that has never been done, rob a moving train. His target is the monthly shipment of gold destined to the Crimea for British soldiers who are there fighting the Russians. The twenty-five thousand pounds sterling in gold is stored in two locked Chubb safes that requires four separate keys to be opened. One key is held by the President of the bank; the second by its senior manager; and the two remaining keys by the station master. Along with his accomplices, Agar (Donald Sutherland) and Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), he sets about acquiring each of them. Once in hand, they must now find a way to break into the luggage compartment where the safes are located, off-load the gold, and then go about their merry way without being caught. It doesn't quite go as planned, but a good thief always have a back-up plan.—garykmcd 1855. Edward Pierce (Sir Sean Connery), a member of London high society, is really a criminal mastermind. He is determined to steal the twenty-five thousand pounds sterling of gold shipped once a month via train by the handling bank, Huddleston and Bradford, from London to Folkestone on the coast, where it is shipped to Crimea as payment to the English troops, who, along with their French counterparts, are waging war there against Russia. There has never been a successful robbery on a moving train, which is considered folly by the authorities. Because of the nature of the safe in the luggage compartment of the train where the gold is kept, Pierce believes the easiest way into the safe is to obtain copies of the four keys required to open the safe, the four which are individually entrusted to three key people, who cannot know that copies have been made. Two are kept locked in the offices of the railway despatcher; one is kept in an unknown location by Huddleston and Bradford President, Edgar Trent (Alan Webb); and one is kept at all times around the neck of the bank branch Manager, Henry Fowler (Malcolm Terris), an acquaintance of Pierce's. Pierce needs the assistance of several people to pull off the heist, he enlisting: his beautiful mistress, Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), who hopes the gold will mean a future for the two of them together; Robert Agar (Donald Sutherland), a screwsman; Barlow (George Downing), his chauffeur; ""Clean Willy"" (Wayne Sleep), a young cat burglar; and Burgess (Michael Elphick), the railway's security guard in the luggage compartment, who he will need to bribe to cooperate. Getting copies of the four keys is no easy task in and of itself, let alone getting the gold off the train undetected if they are able to get that far. They may have to turn to Plan Bs or Cs if they find the situation changes, and/or improvise on the spot if something doesn't work. But the large number of disparate individuals involved in the heist and the complexity of the plan may make the operation collapse under its own weight.—Huggo In 1855, Edward Pierce plays the business gentleman to get access in a London club to Victorian high society marks for his smart thefts. The fiend sets his mind on the regular trainload of gold from London to Folkestone to be shipped to the British troops in the Crimean war, having overheard the banker boast it's perfectly safe, with four keys for the unbreakable safe aboard divided among bank and rail gentleman, and nobody ever robbed a moving train. Pierce recruits a team including pickpocket Agar, his own brothel 'mistress' Miriam, and even cat burglar 'Clean Willy', who specially escapes from prison and has to be put down after the police lean on him. They painstakingly make unnoticed copies of all keys, but on the day find extra safety measures require improvisation, which renders it far more dangerous.—KGF Vissers"

The Swarm,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078350/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A huge swarm of deadly African bees spreads terror over American cities by killing thousands of people. Killer bees from South America have been breeding with the gentler bees of more northern climates, slowly extending their territory northward decade after decade. Entomologist Brad Crane has discovered that something is making them come together in huge, killer swarms. He wants to keep General Slater from using military tactics from further upsetting the balance of nature as they join to try to stop the swarms from approaching Houston, Texas.—Ørnås A swarm of African killer bees attacks an Air Force base in Texas, then the small town of Marysville and later Houston. A team of scientists, leaded by the arrogant Dr. Bradford Crane, tries to find an antidote and an effective way of destroying the lethal swarm against the military command advice, that wants to restrain the area.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) is ordered to investigate a basement level station which they believed was attacked. After Baker contacts his commander, Gen. Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate who drove a civilian van into the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist named Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), the only survivor of the attack. Slater orders two helicopters to check for a black mass (revealed to be bees), but the two helicopters are swarmed by the bees and explode, killing the pilots inside. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. The teenaged son manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Maryville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens) who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation.Recovering from his earlier bee attack, the stung son and some friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, who head to Marysville. The bees reach Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant café waitress Rita (Patty Duke Astin). Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant) watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees manage to besiege the train as well, killing several evacuees, including a love triangle made up of schoolteacher Maureen Scheuster (Olivia de Havilland), retiree Felix Austin (Ben Johnson), and town Mayor Clarence Tuttle (Fred MacMurray), who also runs the town's drug store.Rita, confined to a hospital bed, gives birth to her child, falling in love with the doctor in the process. The savage swarm heads for Houston, so Crane drops eco-friendly bombs on them, hoping that the swarm senses will harm them and stay away from the city. The plan fails, and the young boy who released the swarm onto Marysville dies after once more visiting the hospital, which sends Helena into a rage about why the children have to die. Dr. Krim self-injects an experimental bee venom antidote to keep track of the results, although the trial proves fatal, and Krim dies from the effects of the venom. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jose Ferrer) is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees, ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain). However, at that moment, the alarm sounds and the bees invade the plant, killing both Andrews and Hubbard, as well as completely destroying the plant and wiping out an entire town.Crane and Slater analyze tapes from the original bee invasion and come to the possible conclusion that their alarm system attracted the swarm into the base. The bees invade once more, so Slater uses a flame-thrower to allow Crane and Helena to escape. Sonically altered helicopters successfully manage to lure the bees out to sea, where they douse the water with oil and set the swarm ablaze. Crane wonders if their victory was overall successful or just temporary, then decides that ""if we use our time wisely, the world just might survive."""

Eric Roberts makes an impressive screen debut as Dave, grandson of the aging King Zharko, who is chosen by him to lead the gypsy clan at his death. Dave's only inclination is to join the American mainstream, but he knows that the mantle of gypsy power cannot be taken lightly or denied.—Anonymous King of the gypsies, Zharko Stepanowicz (Sterling Hayden), visits the camp of fellow gypsy Spiro (Michael V. Gazzo) and demands the marriage of Spiro's daughter, Rose (Susan Sarnadon), to his son, Groffo (Judd Hirsch), a union for which Zharko paid $4,500. Spiro explains that Rose refuses the marriage because she does not like Groffo, but offers to refund half of the bride price to compensate Zharko for the inconvenience. Zharko finds the offer unacceptable, so the two men take the matter to the gypsy elders. When the elders rule in favor of Spiro, Zharko agrees to leave, but on the way out of the camp, he grabs Rose and drives away with her. Later, Rose is pleased when she gives birth to Groffo's son, David, since he will one day be king of the gypsies.As a boy, Dave (Corey Einbinder) helps his family with various confidence games to earn money as they roam from state to state, but by the time they settle in New York City and his sister Tita (Brooke Shields) is born, he knows he does not want to live as a gypsy. As alcoholic Groffo physically abuses Dave, Rose and Tita, Dave's resentment against his father grows. When Zharko praises the 12-year-old Dave for his intelligence and offers to arrange a marriage with a gypsy girl named Persa, the boy runs away.Skipping forward several years later an adult, Dave (Eric Roberts) continues to commit acts of fraud and petty larceny until his grandfather approaches him. Believing Groffo is unfit to become king, Zharko offers his ring and medallion, the symbols of the kingship, to Dave. Recoiling, Dave explains he doesn't want to lead the gypsies; he wants to live the ""normal"" life everyone else has. Zharko says that he is dying, so the gypsies will soon need a new leader and he is counting on Dave to assume power. Agreeing to go back to the gypsies, Dave returns to his parents' home to warn his father against beating Rose and Tita. Groffo berates Dave for renouncing the family's ways in order to act like the despised ""gadjos"", or non-gypsies. When Dave rejects Groffo as his father, the two men fight until Groffo pulls a gun and Dave escapes out of the apartment window.Some time later, Dave is working as a singing waiter and dates a gadjo, named Sharon (Annette O'Toole), with whom he has dreams of moving to California. The two head back to his apartment one night to find Rose and Tita waiting for him. Explaining that Groffo has accepted $6,000 to wed Tita to a boy she doesn't like, Rose asks Dave for the money to repay the bride price to get his sister out of the arranged marriage. Dave refuses. While leaving, Rose informs Dave that Zharko is dying in the hospital and asking for him.The next day, Dave goes to the hospital and runs into Persa (Annie Potts), who invites him back to her apartment so Rose can have a private conversation with him. Dave proceeds to his grandfather's bedside where Zharko bestows him with the king's ring and medallion before passing away. Dave announces that he has been made king to Groffo, who is so hurt and betrayed that he refuses to take them.That night, Dave visits Persa to talk to his mother and Rose informs him that Groffo will wed Tita to her groom right after Zharko's funeral. Rose proclaims that Dave is the king whether he wants the role or not and he is shirking his duties by refusing to help his family avoid the unwanted marriage. Dave refuses to accept the responsibility and leaves. On the way home, two thugs chase and attack Dave, but he escapes them and returns home to find Sharon cooking dinner. Dave explains that Groffo hired the two men to kill him and reassures her that they can still go to California after he handles family business. After escorting Sharon out, Dave returns to Persa, who comforts him, and the two make love.Later, at Zharko's funeral, Dave notices Tita in a wedding dress and informs Groffo of his plan to reimburse the young groom's parents so his sister will not have to marry. Groffo is enraged when Dave suggests that his father explain to the parents that the wedding cancellation is not Groffo's choice, but rather the king's decision. When Dave starts to leave with Tita, Groffo tries to stop him until Dave pulls a gun. Dave steals a car and drives away with his sister, promising to take her to California, but Groffo gives chase until both cars crash. Groffo flees the scene as Dave realizes Tita is dead.Later, Dave goes to his parents' home with a shotgun. He chases Groffo throughout the apartment building before blasting his father out of a window, killing him at last. When the police arrive, Rose tells them an unknown gunman broke in and shot her husband.At Groffo's funeral, Dave marvels at how many people showed up to pay their respects, even though his father was a terrible person. At the end of the service, Dave walks out of the cemetery with all the gypsies trailing behind him, noting that he never wanted the position of king, but perhaps he can lead the gypsies into the twentieth century."

An insurance investigator and her local guide search the Lost River Lake area to find too missing teenagers. When stumbling on an abandoned military facility, they release by accident in the river some flesh-eating piranhas that were bred to use in the Vietnam war. The piranhas are heading straight to a nearby summer resort's lake and its guests. When flesh-eating piranhas are accidentally released into a summer resort's rivers, the guests become their next meal.—Concorde - New Horizons (with permission). Two self-righteous idiots accidentally release a genetically-altered species of piranha into a stream. From there, both the piranha and the idiots slowly make their way downstream to various swimming holes and resorts, each in their own way wreaking havoc.—Alfred Jingle A young couple stumble across an abandoned US Army test site on a mountain, in which is a huge pool. Thinking it's an ordinary swimming pool, they jump in. But this pool is home to the piranha, and the couple are eaten alive. A young woman P.I. is hired by the father of one of the missing kids to find them, and she meets up with an alcoholic outdoorsman who lives on the mountain. The two of them find the test site and drain the pool to see what's in it. As they do they are accosted by Dr. Hoak - the sole resident of the test site - who informs them that the inhabitants of the pool were the products of a gene-splicing experiment called 'Operation Razorteeth', designed to produce a mutant strain of piranha fish for deployment in the Vietnam War against the NVA. The fish could live in cold water and breed at a high rate. Realizing that a children's summer camp and the Lost River Lake Resort downriver are in the piranhas' path, they set out to try to stop it. The piranha are well ahead of them, and they kill several people on their way downstream. When they try to warn the camp director and resort owner of the danger, they are arrested. Thanks to the woman's ingenuity they escape custody and race down to the camp in a state police car to warn them. But the piranha have already struck - and there are others who want to keep the danger of the piranha a secret...—Derek O'Cain David (Roger Richman) and Barbara (Janie Squire) are two young backpackers who happen upon a military post that seems to be abandoned. They discover a large man-made reservoir and decide to go skinny dipping. Within minutes they are attacked and consumed by some underwater presence, their death screams attracting the attention of somebody still inside the military facility.Maggie (Heather Menzies) is an investigator hired by Barbara's parents to find their daughter and her companion. With financing from her employer Earl (Richard Deacon), Maggie travels to the mountainous area where the two were last seen, and she seeks out the cabin of Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman). Paul is a backwoods type who lives in a log cabin with his young daughter, who is away at summer camp. Maggie convinces him to take her to the military facility, and they discover the pond. Paul notices that the water is salty. Exploring the buildings of the complex, they find a laboratory with numerous strange animals, including a bizarre, lizard-like creation. Maggie decides that it's possible that David and Barbara drowned in the pond, and she takes the initiative to drain the pond to find out. She flips the switch, and suddenly they are confronted by a white-haired man (Kevin McCarthy) who lurches at them in a panic, trying to shut off the drain switch. In the melee, he is knocked unconscious.Paul and Maggie go outside to the empty pond and find the bones of David and Barbara caught in the drain. When the mysterious man attempts to steal Maggie's jeep, he crashes it and injurs himself even more. Taking him down to Paul's cabin for the night, the man rables on about 'razorteeth' and that they are all in danger.The next morning, Paul and Maggie load the man onto Paul's homemade log raft and they set out downstream to take him to town. When he awakens, he reveals that he is Dr. Hoak, and he explains that Paul and Maggie have done something terrible. The pond contained a breed of mutant piranha, which Hoak had been developing for use in the Vietnam war. After the war, the military pulled the plug on the operation, but Hoak remained and continued experimenting with the piranha at the facility after it was closed down.The piranha begin to claim victims immediately. Paul's friend Jack (Keenan Wynn) dies when the piranha chew off his feet while he sits on the edge of a dock; he crawls away and bleeds to death. Downstream, a father and son are out fishing on the river; the father is killed while trying to fix the outboard engine from under the boat when he is pulled under the water and eaten alive. The boy clings to the capsized boat, but it is gradually sinking into the water. Paul, Maggie and Hoak come upon the scene and the doctor leaps into the water to save the boy. He manages to lift the child onto the raft, but the piranha attack him. Paul and Maggie pull him out of the water, but his wounds are too severe and he dies before he can offer them any advice about how to stop the killer fish.Paul is especially concerned about reaching the summer camp where his daughter, Suzie (Shannon Collins), is located. The camp is downriver from the piranha, and it is only a matter of time before the fish reach it. There is also a new resort further down the river that is about to open for business. Grogan and Maggie make frantic phone calls to both places, but their warnings are dismissed as fiction.Eventually the military gets wind of the piranha and they send Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele) with a group of soldiers to investigate. At first, Mengers denies the piranha exist, but Maggie soon realizes that Mengers and Dr. Hoak were once lovers, and Mengers represents the military's desire to cover up the incident. The soldiers confine Maggie and Paul to their camp, imprisoning them and refusing to let Paul contact his daughter.Maggie and Paul escape the camp, but they are detained by the local police before they can get anybody to listen to them. Paul does manage to contact the head counselor at the camp (Paul Bartel), but he dismisses Paul's message due to his reputation of being an alcoholic. Maggie and Paul manage to break out of jail by subduing the officer who is left to watch them, and escape in his squad car.The next day, the piranha attack the summer camp. Suzie, who is afraid of the water, is hiding on the shore when the other kids and counselors begin to panic in the water. Suzie bravely tries to rescue her two friends, counselors Betsy (Belinda Balaski) and Laura (Melody Thomas Scott) by rowing out onto the lake in a rubber raft. She collects Laura, but Betsy falls into the water and is consumed by the piranha.Paul and Maggie arrive at the camp too late, but after ensuring that Suzie is alright, they race off to the resort. The owner Buck Gardner (Dick Miller) refuses to answer their phone calls (under the advice of Dr. Mengers and her commanding officer who is there), but eventually the piranha attack and mass casualties result as dozens of people are wounded or eaten alive by the vicious fish. Mengers superior is one of the casualties when he falls in the water as people cling onto a ferry boat and he is eaten alive along with several others.During the drive in the stolen police car, Paul remembers that the water in the test pond was salty, but the water in the rivers is fresh water. They conclude that Hoak had bred the piranha to survive in either salt or fresh water, hence if the piranha reach the ocean, they will contaminate the world's waterways, and probaly the oceans as well.Paul and Maggie arrive at the resort and comandeer a speedboat to take them down the lake. Paul's plan is to poison the fish with pollution from a nearby sewage plant, but when they reach the plant by boat, it is now underwater, having been flooded. Paul intends to swim for it, tying a rope around his waist and instructing Maggie to take off if he has not surfaced within two minutes. He swims down to the plant and manages to get inside, opening up the tanks containing the raw sewage, but the piranha approach and attack him. Maggie finishes her countdown and takes off, pulling Paul to safety.Paul is wounded and in shock, but alive. He is tended by Maggie and Suzy at the resort as the military and other medics tend to dozens of dead and wounded people. As the film closes, Dr. Mengers speaks to the media, assuring everyone that there is nothing left to fear of the piranha whom have been killed by the sewage waste at the edge of the lake. But, the open-ending question leaves the end up in the air: have the piranha really reached the ocean as was once feared?"
Pretty Baby,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078111/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A preteen girl lives as a prostitute in New Orleans in 1917. In 1917, in the red light district Storyville, New Orleans, the prostitute Hattie lives with her twelve year-old daughter Violet in the fancy brothel of Madame Nell, where she works. Photographer Ernest J. Bellocq has an attraction to Hallie and Violet and he is an habitué of the whorehouse. One day, Madame Nell auctions Violet's virginity and the winner pays the fortune of US$ 400 to spend the night with the girl. Then Hattie marries a wealthy client and moves to Saint Louis, leaving Violet in the brothel alone. Violet decides to marry Bellocq and she moves to his house. Until the day that Hattie, who has overcome her past, comes to Bellocq's house with the intention to take Violet with her.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1917, the last months of legal prostitution in Storyville - New Orleans' red-light district. Hattie, a prostitute at the elegant home of Madame Nell, and her 12-year-old daughter Violet are the only ones awake with photographer Ernest J. Bellocq comes by with his camera. He takes pictures of Hattie and he fascinates Violet. Over the next few months, Nell arranges for the auction of Violet's virginity, Hattie marries and goes to St. Louis leaving Violet behind, and Violet determines to marry Bellocq. Is this idyllic or is she just a girl wearing rouge, soon to return to childhood?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> This film is partly based on an interview with an actual child prostitute that worked in New Orleans during the early 20th century as found in the book ""Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red-Light District"" by Al Rose.The movie opens with eleven-year-old Violet (played by a 12-year-oldBrooke Shields) watching the birth of her baby brother. This echoes her own beginnings as the daughter of prostitute Hattie (Susan Sarandon) and an unknown client. Violet is one of several children living at Madam Nell's (Frances Faye) swanky New Orleans brothel in 1917.Early one morning photographer Bellocq (Keith Carradine) comes calling looking for a model. Hattie poses for him while Violet watches. At first Bellocq finds Violets inquisitive nature a bother, but after a while he starts to like her. Violet seems fascinated by Bellocq as he never seems to want to have sex with the girls, but just photograph them.Even given her tender years Violet has been become part of the brothel business. She is playing in one of the upstairs bedrooms when her mother brings a client in telling him that Violet is a virgin and only for ""French."" Hattie indicates Violet is to follow them back to her room where Hattie climbs on the bed and starts to undress and the client drops his pants and sits down. It is clear that Violet is expected to stimulate him orally. With the resigned sigh of someone who has already done this too many times Violet enters the room, closes the door and the scene ends.When Violet turns 12 arrangements are made to auction off her virginity. Nell gives a dinner party for her best clients during which Violet, dressed only in a sheer, see-though gown is paraded around the table on a platter as the madam announces the auction. A few minutes later, redressed in a white party dress, Violet stands in the parlor while the men of the house bid on her. The winner (Don Lutenbacher), then carries Violet up to a bedroom. A short scream announces the loss of her virginity and we see her client hurriedly depart from the house. When the other girls check on Violet they find her motionless lying across the bed and fear the worst. She breaks out laughing and we realize she is only joking with them, though she winces when she sits up, telling us that her initiation into womanhood has not been completely painless.Violet now becomes a regular part of the brothel lineup, though not always at her convenience. She is interrupted mid-bath by Madam Nell who wants to show her to a rough-looking farmer customer (Hobe May). (This scene involved nudity for Shields and is one of the more controversial in the film).One day Hattie's client/ boyfriend, Alfred Fuller (Don Hood) announces he is moving Hattie and her baby son to St. Louis where he will marry her. His plans don't include Violet as Hattie in her vanity has told him Violet is her younger sister. Hattie promises Violet at the right time she will break the news to him and send for her. Hattie leaves and Bellocq complains to Nell about Violet being left alone. Nell's response is that Violet is now making plenty of money on her own and the only reason Bellocq is concerned is that he has fallen in love with her, something he vehemently denies.Violet misbehaves and Nell orders the bartender (Henry Braden) to take her to woodshed and discipline her. We hear the beating after which a defiant Violet emerges and declares to Nell, ""It didnt hurt!"" When she turns away though we see the whipping was violent enough to shred her nightgown and we can see her bare bottom.This incident causes Violet to leave the brothel and move in with Bellocq. He is opposed to the idea at first but Violet uses her feminine charms to convince him to let her stay. However, she soon becomes bored of just being his photography model and he is not yet prepared to deal with her childishness. After one long nude photography session (This scene involved frontal nudity for Shields and is also highly controversial) they fight and in revenge Violet scratches some of the Belloca's valuable negatives and he throws her out of the house.Violet returns to the brothel, but it is clear that things are not going well there. The Navy has pressured the city into closing the district. At Nell's house items are being sold off one-by-one and the girls are making arrangements to find other places to live. Violet packs her things too, but before she can get far Bellocq arrives, tells Violet he is going to marry her and she agrees. Though a girl as young as Violet usually needs her parents permission to marry it is allowed because she has been abandoned. Violet, the girls and Bellocq celebrate with a picnic along the river.One morning at Bellocq's house after about two weeks of marriage it is clear that Violet has not quite adapted perfectly to the role of a wife as all she seems to do is have sex and sleep, but it is clear that Bellocq still loves her. Violet and Bellocq's breakfast is interrupted when Hattie and her new husband arrive. They demand that Violet come with them and join them in St. Louis as part of a ""proper"" family. Violet is torn between Bellocq and her mother, but as her mother has the firmer legal claim, Violet has little choice but to go with her. At the station her new step-father attempts to take a family portrait of his wife and her son and daughter, but it is clear from Violet's expression that Violet wonders if she can ever go back to being just a child after having lived as an adult."

Tensions begin to build as months go on, and they come to realize that they've fallen prey to consumerism. Soon afterward, they have even heavier problems to worry about, as a large gang of bikers discovers the mall and invades it, ruining the survivors' best-laid plans and forcing them to fight off both lethal bandits and flesh-eating zombies.—Curly Q.

After several attempts during their flight across Pennsylvania, they find a deserted mega-mall in Monroeville, outside Pittsburgh, and decide to wait there until the crisis is over. They clear the mall of the undead and board the entrances up with tractor-trailers and then sit down and wait. Can they hold out, not only against the growing, moaning, and hungry masses of the undead outside, against murderous looters, but, most importantly of all, can they hold out and not lose their sanity...?—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> This sequel of ""Night of the Living Dead"" is filled with splattered blood and brains in living color. The dead have come back to life to eat the living. This is the story of the escape of four people from an urban nightmare to a suburban nightmare. They barricade themselves in a shopping mall and try to start new lives. Much of this movie was filmed outside Pittsburgh.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> Tensions are running high in the United States. The recently deceased are returning to life as shambling, flesh-eating ghouls, and political dissidents are threatening social stability. In the city of Philadelphia, Fran (Gaylen Ross) an employee of WGON-TV and Radio learns that her program director Givens is broadcasting out-of-date information about rescue stations that have been overrun by the living dead. Fran's boyfriend Stephen (David Emge), who pilots the station's traffic helicopter, arrives at the station and tells her that they must escape in order to survive. He plans on stealing the station's helicopter and tells Fran to meet him on the roof at 9pm.Meanwhile, in another part of Philadelphia, the city's SWAT team is preparing to launch an assault on a low-income tenement building filled with African-American and Hispanic refugees who refuse to leave their homes for emergency shelters; they also refuse to give up their dead, both deceased and re-animated, harboring them in the basement of the tenement. After a gun battle with armed bandits on the roof, the police and National Guard soldiers break into the building using tear gas. Roger (Scott H. Reiniger) one of the SWAT troopers, becomes disgusted by the bloodthirsty behavior of some of their fellow SWAT members when one of them, named Wooley, goes crazy and begins shooting at both zombies and innocent bystanders. A tall figure in a gas mask shoots the rogue officer dead.Roger retreats to the basement to escape the confusion, but the tall figure follows him. He removes his mask and reveals himself to be an imposing man named Peter (Ken Foree). They smoke cigarettes and talk for a few minutes and agree that the zombie plague will only get worse. Roger tells Peter about his friend who has a helicopter; he plans to leave with Stephen and Fran, and suggests Peter join their escape. The two SWAT men are startled when a elderly Hispanic priest emerges from a room in the cellar; the man is missing a leg and walks with a crutch. He tells them that he has administered the last rites to the dead people in the next room, and that the soldiers may now ""do what they will"" with them. Peter and Roger kill all the zombies in the cellar, nearly overcome by the gravity of the situation.Meanwhile, Stephen and Fran arrive in their helicopter at an abandoned police station pier on the Delaware River to refuel and wait for Roger to show up. They are surprised when four rogue policemen arrive and threaten them for looting the place. Roger and Peter arrive and the rogue cops back down allowing the four to go on their way. Stephen and Fran are surprised that Roger has brought someone with him, but they agree to take Peter with them. The four of them fly all night.In the morning, Stephen lands the helicopter at a small, deserted rural airport depot to refuel. While exploring the area, zombies, wandering nearby or lurking among the scant cover, attack them. Stephen tries to prove his manliness before Fran -- who is carrying his child -- but he is both clumsy and a poor shot. Roger has to kill the zombies Stephen weakly shoots at, and Stephen nearly kills Peter when aiming for a zombie. Peter becomes infuriated, aiming his rifle at Steven to scare him.Later, while in the air again, they see a deserted shopping mall. They land on its roof and break in through a skylight to rest and to collect supplies. The parking lots are full of zombies and the interior of the mall has many of them milling about inside -- the group theorizes that the undead were drawn to a place that had meant something to them when they were alive. Despite the growing number of undead outside, the four refugees realize that they could survive there for a long time. It even has a gun shop so they will be able to find weapons to defend themselves and ammunition for the arms they already have. Using the mall's floor plans and master keys, Peter, Roger and Stephen race around the mall, collecting the supplies they will need to make a home. They take these supplies to an upstairs area where they and Fran build a home in an annex of former offices and storage rooms. Fran is resistant to the idea; she thinks it is a bad idea to leave what is left of society, but perhaps because she is pregnant and wants to do what's best for her child, she stays. She is later accosted by one of the zombies and insists that she never be left alone again and that they teach her to shoot properly so she can defend herself and that Stephen teach her how to fly the chopper if anything happens to him.The next day, the group realizes they need to clear all the walking dead out of the rest of the mall. A decision is made to block the entrances to the mall with semi-trucks from a nearby warehouse. While Stephen circles the operation in his helicopter, Peter and Roger hot-wire the trucks and drive them to the mall. Peter is disturbed that Roger seems to be losing his grip on reality; he becomes arrogant and takes unnecessary risks in order to demonstrate his mastery of the situation, earning a stern lecture from Peter, who tells him he's risking his partner's life as much as his own. Roger is still arrogant and dismissive and unfortunately, he is bitten by zombies while trying to retrieve the toolkit he'd left behind. They all realize that Roger's wound will prove fatal, as nobody can survive a bite for more than a few days. Fran is conflicted; she wants to take Roger to a medical facility, but the others won't hear of it. They are convinced Roger is doomed but decide to let the ""disease"" run its course.Over the next several days, they begin to make the mall their home. They care for the ailing Roger as best they can, but his condition rapidly deteriorates until it is clear he is on the verge of death. Peter and Stephen build a fake wall in front of the only hallway that leads to their home, disguising it from any potential looters that may come through the area. They monitor a television to see if the zombie crisis ever ends but the news is dismal. Roger makes Peter promise to kill him if he reanimates. Roger does return, however, and Peter is forced to shoot his animated corpse in the head. They bury Roger inside of a large planter that houses decorative palm trees inside the mall.One night, Peter prepares a romantic dinner for Fran and Stephen. When Peter leaves them alone, Stephen proposes marriage to Fran. Fran declines, saying that they can't make that kind of commitment given what has become of the world. ""It wouldn't be real,"" she explains. Stephen seems to be depressed by her refusal.Over the next few months, the three survivors, Stephen, Fran, and Peter, have hauled various items from the mall (furniture, appliances, etc) in the office space as their home. Fran is now showing signs of her pregnancy as she walks around the windowless apartment. Peter is seen unhappily hitting tennis balls against a wall on the roof of the mall to relieve his boredom. By now, there are hundreds of zombies wondering around the empty acres of the parking lot that surrounds the mall.Eventually, all television and radio transmissions cease. The remaining three bicker as their sense of isolation and claustrophobia gets stronger. One evening, Stephen and Peter play cards using the worthless cash stolen from the mall bank, while Fran cooks them dinner. During the dinner, Fran becomes annoyed by the white noise static from the nearby TV set and asks to turn it off -- there hasn't been a broadcast in three days. Stephen refuses to turn off the TV set. Fran gets up from the table and turns off the TV before returning to her place at the table. Stephen promptly rises and defiantly turns the TV back on. Fran then exclaims, ""what have we done to ourselves?!"" It is here that all three of them realize that the goods they have that meant something to the civilized world mean nothing now. Their place of sanctuary has become more of a prison.During one of her lessons when teaches her how to fly it, Fran and Stephen are spotted by a gang of motorcycle-riding survivalists who have been casing the mall. That evening, the survivalists/looters approach, coveting the supplies inside the mall. They try to contact Peter, Fran and Stephen by radio, but Peter is smart enough not to respond. He knows that they will be killed if the survivalists find them. His plan is to let the looters break in and take what they want, then leave, betting that they won't find the camouflaged entrance to their home. The looters break into the mall, and zombies flood in with them. Stephen, believing that the mall belongs to him and his friends, sneaks into the mall and tries to shoot the bikers, who return fire. With no choice but to help his friend, Peter creeps through air shafts, picking off isolated bikers and zombies. Unable to cope with both Peter and the zombies, the bikers decide to leave. Before they do, two of them enter the elevator where Stephen is hiding on top, and begin blindly shooting, severely wounding him. He is later attacked and bitten by zombies, and dies in the elevator. In the mall, the zombies corner and eviscerate several of the remaining looters.Peter returns to their hidden apartment and waits with Fran; they are unsure if Stephen has survived, but they know he will return either way. Now a zombie, Stephen remembers how to get through the hidden wall to the storeroom. He leads the horde of zombies up the stairwell. When the zombie Stephen appears, Peter kills him. He tells Fran to leave, refusing to go with her. He helps Fran onto the roof, where she prepares the helicopter. Peter stays in the storeroom, waiting for the zombies to flock in and planning to shoot himself before they can grab him. But at the last minute, he decides he wants to live and fights his way through the zombies to the helicopter. Fran delayed taking off until the last possible moment, and Peter is able to hop into the helicopter. The two fly off to an uncertain future, with little fuel left."

One day, he participates of a heist of a casino and a player (Isabelle Adjani) is the main witness. However, she tells to the detective (Bruce Dern) in charge of the investigation that the suspect is not the driver of the getaway car. The detective becomes obsessed to arrest the driver and he seeks out a gang that has robbed a supermarket and promises to ""forgive"" their heist if they help him to arrest the driver in a bank robbery. But the player helps the driver to exchange the dirty money.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In Los Angeles, a young man, a getaway Driver for hire, is confident in his abilities which includes being able to outwit those who may be in pursuit, most likely the police. As such, he has professional standards, can pick and choose which jobs he will do, can command top dollar for his services, and has never been caught with the police not knowing who he is. He has a Handler, she who organizes those behind-the-scenes items that his associates do not need to know for him to carry out his work successfully. She has however stated that she will not risk her life for him. He will not tolerate associates who do not carry out the robberies according to plan. It is because of one of those errors by his associates in carrying out a casino robbery that the Driver knows that one of the casino Players got a good glimpse of him before he was able to get away. The Driver will have to understand and work to the motivations of the Player to elude capture. A police Detective investigating the casino robbery is however certain that the Driver was involved in the casino robbery, as well as was the getaway driver for several other high stakes robberies, this certainty about which he is up front with the Driver. He will have to get a positive identification from the Player for a conviction specifically for the casino robbery. In addition, the Detective decides he will set up an unauthorized sting to nab the Driver in action. The sting involves co-opting captured robbers to carry out a real life robbery, with them hiring the Driver to orchestrate and conduct the getaway. Despite the Detective being confident that the sting will work, his police associates are less confident, they knowing that anything going wrong, including anyone being able to get away with the money and/or someone innocent being killed, will certainly mean their badges. The Driver, who knows that the Detective is out for him, has to decide how much he will risk for the bigger than usual reward, which includes knowing that he outwitted the Detective at his own game.—Huggo In a desolate parking garage, The Driver casually opens a car with a shim, hot wires its ignition and drives away. In a casino, The Player deals a hand of poker, places her bet, then leaves the table to cash in her tokens while The Driver waits outside in the stolen car. As The Player exits through security, two thieves knock out the guard and proceed to rob the casino. She watches as the two robbers pile into the car and The Driver takes off and an aggressive car chase ensues around the city, with the outcome having The Driver accelerating towards two oncoming police cars, forcing them off-course and enabling The Driver to make a clean getaway. He takes the stolen car to a junkyard to dispose the evidence, leaving his shim inside, and collects his cash. The next day, The Detective and his two plainclothes partners pull the car out of the junkyard and find the shim.In a police line-up, the witnesses are unable to identify The Driver, including The Player, who insists he is not the same man she saw at the casino. Undeterred by the lack of a witness, The Detective still believes The Driver is guilty and unsuccessfully tries to extract a confession out of him at a bar, instead vowing to catch him eventually. Later that night, a gang of amateur thieves rob a local supermarket and make an awkward getaway with a different getaway driver, who used to be a former partner of The Driver. After getting caught, The Detective offers a deal to the gang's head thief, Glasses: if he agrees to cooperate in a sting operation to set up The Driver, he will be released without imprisonment. Although one of the plainclothes policemen, partnered with The Detective, is hesitant about the covert plan to stage a bank robbery, The Detective threatens to blackmail him if Glasses does not participate.Later, when The Driver meets The Player to deliver her payment, the Detective visits her apartment. Hiding in the bedroom, The Driver overhears The Detective's attempts at forcing The Player to identify The Driver, but she refuses, despite his threats to expose her past transgressions. At a bar, The Driver meets The Connection, who tells him about a prospective group of clients. Although he expresses no interest in working with shooters,, he meets them in a parking garage. To convince them of his abilities, he maneuvers them around the garage, nearly destroying their stolen Mercedes. Although the team is convinced of his skill, The Driver turns down the job. Later, one of the shooters, Teeth, attempts to persuade The Driver to take the job at gunpoint, but The Driver knocks him down a stairwell and reiterates his refusal. In an effort to convince The Driver, The Detective goes to his apartment, offers him the shim he left behind in the junked car, and proposes a game: If The Driver successfully pulls off the heist, he gets to keep the money, but if The Detective catches him, he will win the satisfaction of putting The Driver in prison.Taking the shim, The Driver accepts The Detective's challenge. When he tells the shooters that he has doubled his price, The Driver also stipulates that Teeth cannot be included in the operation. Glasses then reports to The Detective that they have made a deal with The Driver, but demands The Detective fulfills his end of the deal, with he Detective demanding back that there be no shooting during the heist. The subsequent bank robbery, however, goes awry. When one of the thieves triggers the alarm, Glasses shoots him and leaves him behind for the police, before escaping in The Driver's getaway car. After arriving in an empty warehouse garage, Glasses holds The Driver at gunpoint, assuming that he is unarmed, and tells him that the heist was a police set-up. The Driver also pulls a gun and shoots Glasses dead. After The Driver leaves with the cash, Teeth shows up at the scene on a motorcycle and discovers Glasses' dead body.The Driver stashes the cash in a locker at Union Station, checks into a cheap hotel and meets up with The Connection, who agrees to arrange an exchange of the dirty money for laundered money. Later, The Kid holds up The Connection in her apartment. After shoving his gun down her throat, she reveals the Driver's hideout and the location of the cash, but is killed anyway. The Player shows up at The Driver's hotel room and tries to persuade him to lay low and wait six months before getting the cash, but he says that he wants to play out his game with The Detective regardless. Later, she swaps locker keys with an Exchange Man at Union Station while one of The Detective's plainclothes partners describes the interaction to him over a payphone. After retrieving the cash from the locker, the Exchange Man boards a leaving train, but is followed by The Detective, looking for a suitcase that matches his plainclothes partner's description. After an altercation in the train's bathroom, the Exchange Man is shot dead by The Detective and falls out a window.As The Player leaves Union Station, Teeth steals her purse and makes off with the locker key holding the laundered cash. Outside, The Driver waits for her in a car and they chase after Teeth. The treacherous pursuit through downtown Los Angeles concludes in a warehouse, where the two cars play a game of cat and mouse. When The Kid and his hired driver make a break to exit, they are confronted by The Driver, who accelerates towards them head-on. As their car swerves, it flips over and gets destroyed, but Teeth refuses to give up and The Driver is forced to shoot Teeth dead when he draws his gun. After collecting The Player's purse and letting Teeth's driver go free, The Driver returns to Union Station to retrieve the cash. Opening the suitcase, The Driver looks behind to see The Detective, his plainclothes partners, and a brigade of police officers waiting to arrest him. As The Player watches, The Detective smugly declares his victory, but his self-satisfaction quickly turns to anger when The Driver presents him with an empty case, commenting that they have both been swindled. The Driver then walks away a free man."
Damien: Omen II,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077394/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Damien the Antichrist, now about to turn thirteen years old, finally learns of his destiny under the guidance of an unholy disciple of Satan. Meanwhile dark forces begin to eliminate all those who suspect the child's true identity. Seven years later, Damien Thorn is about to turn 13 and is just discovering who he really is, and what he is destined to do. Now living with his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin in a wealthy suburb of Chicago, Damien is in line to inherit everything from his family. Can Richard Thorn finish the job that Damien's father (Ambassador Robert Thorn) started?—Mark J. Popp <poppmj@cadvision.com> Jerusalem, Israel. One week after the burial of Robert and Katherine Thorn (in the first Omen movie), archeologist Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) asks his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) to deliver a box to the guardian of Thorn's young son, Damien. He reveals that Damien is the Antichrist and that the box contains a warning and the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to the ruin of Yigael's wall, showing him an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face. Morgan is convinced, but the two are buried alive as a tunnel collapses.Seven years later, 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant) at a large house outside of Chicago, Illinois. He gets along well with his 15-year-old cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, he is despised by Aunt Marion (Sylvia Sidney), who favors Mark and thinks Damien a bad influence, even threatening to cut Richard out of her will if he does not separate the two boys. The same night, the appearance of a raven wakes her up and causes a fatal heart attack.Through a friend, Dr. Charles Warren (Nicholas Pryor), who is the curator of the Thorn Museum, Richard is introduced to journalist Joan Hart (Elizabeth Shephard), who was a colleague of Keith Jennings (from the previous film). Having seen Yigael's Wall and drawing a link to all the deaths that surrounded Damien, including Jennings', Joan tries to warn Richard but he throws her out of his limo. After a confrontation with Warren and Ann Thorn at the Thorn Museum, Joan became unsure on whether Damien's face matches the painting on Yigael's Wall. Joan goes to meet Damien at his school, but when she sees his face she drives off in panic. On the road, her car mysteriously dies down. When she gets out of the car, she is attacked by a raven, which pecks her eyes out, causing her to be run over by a passing truck.A few months later at Thorn Industries, manager Paul Buher (Robert Foxworth) suggests expanding the company's operations into agriculture; however, the project is shelved by senior manager Bill Atherton (Lew Ayres), who calls Buher's intention of buying up land in the process immoral. At Mark's birthday party, Buher introduces himself to Damien, invites him to see the plant, and also speaks of his approaching initiation.Buher seemingly makes up with Atherton, who drowns after falling through the ice at a hockey game on a frozen lake the following day. The black raven again makes an appearance at the scene. A shocked Richard leaves on vacation. As Richard agrees to the agriculture project in principle and leaves Buher in charge of the company, Buher then initiates plans on his own... revealing himself to be some kind of follower of Satan. Buher plots to buy up land in various Third World countries and use the weapon of famine to sell to the people the bought up crops at high prices.Meanwhile at the academy, Damien's new commander, Sgt. Dan Neff (Lance Henriksen), takes the boy under his wing and warns him not to draw any attention on himself until the right moment. He also points him to the Bible's Revelation, Chapter 13, in which Damien reads about the beast. Finding its number, 666, scarred onto his scalp, he flees the Academy grounds in a terrified panic, distraught at being chosen as the vehicle for Satan's will.A few days later, David Pasarian (Allan Arbus), an engineer at Thorn Industries, alerts Buher that some people were murdered after having refused to sell their land. Pasarian intends to inform Richard about his suspicions about Buher, but on the very next day, some chemical machinery explodes and releases toxic fumes, killing Pasarian and his assistant, and injuring Damien's class, who were visiting the plant. Damien alone does not suffer damage, but is taken to hospital as a precaution.A doctor named Dr. Kane (Meshach Taylor) investigates to why Damien was not affected by the chemicals. After taking a blood sample and examining it, Dr. Kane discovers that Damien's blood cell structure resembles that of a jackal. But before the baffled doctor can report this to anyone else, the unseen forces of darkness dispose of him too in another gory freak accident when he is cut in half by a falling elevator cable.Meanwhile, Bugenhagen's box has been found in the ruins and delivered to the Thorn Museum. When opened by Dr. Charles Warren, it contains the Seven Daggers of Meggido, the only weapons able to kill Damien, and the letter from Bugenhagen explaining that Damien is the Antichrist. Charles rushes to inform Richard as well as give him Bugenhagen's letter. But Richard angrily refuses to belive this and throws him out of his house. The next day, Richard confides in Anne with the letter after having read it, but she convinces him not to believe it.Mark, who overheard Richard's altercation with Charles, confronts Damien in the nearby forest, who first reluctantly and then proudly admits to being the Devil's son. Damien tries to convince Mark that he truly cares for him as his brother and asks Mark to join him, but Mark refuses. Damien kills Mark by introducing an aneurysm into his brain.Shaken by his son's death, Richard follows Charles' invitation to New York City. A half-crazy Warren takes him to Yigael's Wall, stored in a cargo carrier at a local railroad yard, on which Richard sees Damien's image. Immediately afterward, a switching locomotive hits the carrier, impaling Charles and destroying the wall, finally convincing Richard beyond doubt that Damien is the Antichrist.Upon his return to Chicago, Richard has Damien picked up from a ceremony at the academy and argues with Ann about Damien. As they find the daggers in Charles' office in the Thorn Museum, Ann uses them to kill Richard, proclaiming that she ""always belonged to him"". Ann is then engulfed by a fire, caused by Damien who overheard the altercation from outside. Damien, now the sole heir to Thorn Industries, exits the museum and is picked up by a driver as the fire department arrives. With all his enemies dead and under the tutulage of Satan's unholy disciples of Sgt. Neff and Paul Buher, it is clear that Damien is now on his way to becoming a world figure in controlling the world for the Devil."

The Lord of the Rings,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Fellowship of the Ring embark on a journey to destroy the One Ring and end Sauron's reign over Middle-earth. A young Hobbit known as Frodo has been thrown on an amazing adventure, when he is appointed the job of destroying the One Ring, which was created by the Dark Lord Sauron. He is assigned with three warriors including Gandelf, Aragorn, and Boromir. But it's not going to be an easy journey for the Fellowship of the Ring, on the ultimate quest to rid the Middle-earth of all evil.—Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forged nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, and three for the Elf-Kings. At the same time, the Dark Lord Sauron made the One Ring to rule them all after learning the secrets of how to forge them from the Elves of Hollin--a deviation from Tolkien's work in which Sauron taught ring lore to the Elves and forged all the rings except the three Elvish rings. As the Last Alliance of Elves and Men fell, the Ring fell into the hands of Prince Isildur from across the sea, and after Isildur was killed by orcs, the Ring lay at the bottom of the river Anduin. Over time, Sauron captured the nine Rings made for men and turned their owners into the Ringwraiths, terrible beings who roamed the world searching for the One Ring. The Ring was found by a Stoor named Déagol, whose friend, Sméagol, murdered him and stole it for himself. The Ring warped Sméagol into a twisted, gurgling wretch known only as Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe), and he wandered with it to a cave in the Misty Mountains. Hundreds of years later, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) accidentally discovered his ""precious"" Ring and took it back with him to the Shire.
Years later, during Bilbo's birthday celebrations in the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (William Squire) tells him to leave the Ring for Frodo Baggins (Christopher Guard). Bilbo agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that the Shire is in danger: evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses to all of Middle-earth. Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him.
He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths pursuing them, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, where they meet Aragorn (John Hurt), who is first introduced to them as Strider, a friend of Gandalf's, who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths with a knife imbued with evil magic. Part of the knife stays inside him, and he gets sicker as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels), and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the enchanted river. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by its lord, Elrond. He meets Gandalf again, held captive by his fellow wizard Saruman (Fraser Kerr), who plans to join with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Bilbo, Gandalf, and the others argue about what should be done with the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to Mordor, where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor (Michael Graham Cox); Legolas; Gimli the dwarf (David Buck); and Frodo's original three hobbit companions.
Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced to take a path under the mountains via Moria. Moria was an ancient dwarf kingdom, but is now full of orcs and other evil creatures, and Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a balrog. The remaining eight members of the Fellowship continue through the elf-haven Lothlórien, but Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo. Frodo decides to leave the others behind and continue his quest alone, although faithful Sam insists on accompanying him.
Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of Rohan. The hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn forest, where they meet Treebeard (John Westbrook), a huge tree-like creature. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas find Merry and Pippin; they find small footprints and follow them into Fangorn Forest. There, they find Gandalf, whom they believed had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where Gandalf persuades King Théoden (Philip Stone) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification Helm's Deep.
Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, discover Gollum stalking them, and capture him. Frodo pities him, and lets him live in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor. At Helm's Deep, Théoden's forces struggle to resist an onslaught of orcs sent by Saruman. Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time, destroying the orc army."

It's members don't attend class, are the source of endless pranks on campus and have broken every rule imaginable. As a group, they have a negligible GPA and their main reason for living is to party. When Wormer finally finds a way to expel them all, the men of Delta Tau Chi decide to give the college a homecoming parade they will never forget.—garykmcd 1962. Friends and roommates Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman, having just entered their freshman year at Faber College, are looking to join a fraternity. Being part of the ""out"" crowd (as they are referred by one ""it"" girl as a wimp and a blimp respectively), they are only accepted by Delta Tau Chi, arguably the worst fraternity on campus, and Kent only because he is a legacy. Despite Robert Hoover being the chapter president, its leader is Eric Stratton - ""Otter"" - the ladies man of the group. Otter has as his 2IC Donald Schoenstein - ""Boon"" - whose supportive girlfriend Katy doesn't much like the fact of Boon, Otter and the others' idea of a good time being to get constantly drunk. At the bottom of the Delta barrel is John Blutarsky - ""Bluto"" - the chief troublemaker with a 0.0 GPA. Within the Delta environment, Larry and Kent - renamed ""Pinto"" and ""Flounder"" respectively by the fraternity - blossom socially as much as they can by being accepted for who they are, but end up being sucked into the goings-on for good or bad of their fraternity brothers. The college's dean, Vernon Wormer, with the help of the stuck up members of Omega Theta Pi led by preppy Greg Marmalard, has vowed to find some way to revoke Delta's charter and expel its members for what seems to be their joy at and singular goal of disrupting life on campus in any way they can. Their general battles take on personal undertones with the involvement of a few women: Mandy Pepperidge, Greg's girlfriend who isn't as innocent as she likes to appear; southern belle Babs Jansen, Mandy's sorority sister who is in love with Greg and thus will willingly throw Mandy under the proverbial bus to get into Greg's heart and pants; and Marion Wormer, the Dean's bored wife. Throughout the battle, the ultimate question becomes which side will have the final move to trump all others.—Huggo Fall, 1962. Undoubtedly, the Delta Tau Chi House is by far the raunchiest fraternity in Faber College. There, slackers like Otter, Boone, Hoover, D-Day and Bluto fight for their right to party. Sharing their time between secret initiation rites and no-holds-barred toga gatherings, the perpetual undergraduates have no intention of leaving this idyllic place on earth. However, the snotty Omegas and scheming Dean Vernon Wormer are onto them, and they are hell-bent on putting the Deltas on probation. After all, Wormer has been secretly aching to expel the boys once and for all. But if Vernon succeeds, no one knows how the Deltas will react. Is the slimy professor prepared for a head-on confrontation with the rowdy bunch of loud anarchists? Can the campus handle chaos, explosions, and the animals' revenge?—Nick Riganas In 1962, college freshmen Lawrence ""Larry"" Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) seek to join a fraternity at Faber College. They visit the prestigious Omega Theta Pi House's invitational party, but are not welcomed there. They then try next door at Delta Tau Chi House, the campus' most raucous and undisciplined fraternity, where Kent's brother was once a member, making Kent a ""legacy."" There they find the slovenly John ""Bluto"" Blutarsky (John Belushi) urinating outside the fraternity house and a wild party already underway inside. The Deltas ""need the dues"" so they permit Larry and Kent to pledge. They receive the fraternity names ""Pinto"" (Larry) and ""Flounder"" (Kent).Vernon Wormer (John Vernon), dean of Faber College, wants to expel Delta from campus due to repeated conduct violations and low academic standing. Since they are already on probation, he puts the Deltas on something he calls ""double secret probation"" and orders the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) to find a way to get rid of the Deltas permanently.Flounder is bullied by Omega member and ROTC cadet commander Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), so Bluto and Daniel Simpson ""D-Day"" Day (Bruce McGill) persuade Flounder to sneak Neidermeyer's horse into Dean Wormer's office late at night. They give him a gun and tell him to shoot it. Unbeknownst to Flounder, the gun is loaded with blanks. Unable to bring himself to kill the horse, he fires into the air but the noise frightens the horse so much that it dies of a heart attack.In the cafeteria the next day, smooth-talking Eric ""Otter"" Stratton (Tim Matheson) tries to convince the stuck-up Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller), with whom he'd had a one-time tryst, to abandon her boyfriend, the uninteresting Marmalard, and date him instead. Bluto provokes Marmalard with his impression of a popping zit by stuffing his mouth with a scoop of mashed potatoes and propelling it at Marmalard and table mates, Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon) and Barbara ""Babs"" Jansen (Martha Smith). Bluto starts a food fight that engulfs the cafeteria.Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming psychology test, but it turns out the Omegas switch the discarded exam mimeograph stencil and the Deltas get every answer wrong. Their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer needs only one more incident to revoke their charter and kick them out permanently.To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party. They go shopping at the local market, using Pinto's thick cardigan sweater to hide loads of food they don't want to pay for. During the party Otis Day and the Knights perform ""Shout"". The dean's alcoholic, lecherous wife, Marion (Verna Bloom), attends the party at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette (Sarah Holcomb), a girl he met at the supermarket, and makes out with her only to learn she is the mayor's 13-year-old daughter. He later takes her home in a shopping cart, abandoning her at the front door. Due to the party, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court with the Omegas and revokes Delta's charter and all their belongings are confiscated from their house.To take their minds off their troubles, Otter, Donald ""Boon"" Schoenstein (Peter Riegert), Flounder and Pinto go on a road trip in a car Flounder borrowed from his brother. Otter picks up some girls from Emily Dickinson College by pretending to be the fiancé of Fawn Liebowitz, a girl who recently died on campus. They stop at a roadhouse because Otis Day and the Knights are performing there, not realizing that it caters to an exclusively black clientele. The hulking patrons intimidate the guys and they flee, damaging Flounder's brother's car and leaving their frightened dates behind.Boon breaks up with his girlfriend Katy (Karen Allen) after discovering her sexual relationship with a professor (Donald Sutherland). Marmalard is told that his girlfriend is having an affair with Otter, so he and other Omegas lure him to a motel and beat him up. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all. He even notifies their draft boards of their eligibility. In the process, before Bluto attempts to speak to the dean, Wormer orders Flounder to speak, saying ""Well? Out with it!"", whereupon Flounder vomits on the dean.It seems time for the Deltas to give up, but Bluto, supported by the injured Otter, rouses them with an impassioned, historically inaccurate speech (""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?!"") and they decide to take revenge on Wormer and the Omegas. Stork shoves the drum major out from his position at the head of the marching band and leads them down a one-way alley, trapping them. Hoover attaches one end of a chain to a telephone pole and the back of one of the floats, tearing it apart. Several other Deltas use a makeshift mortar to launch flares onto the street. When Neidermeyer and his ROTC unit chase after the Deltas, Flounder tosses a large jar of marbles in their path, spilling them all to the pavement. Flounder produces a large soda sprayer for Neidermeyer but he's forced to retreat when Neidermeyer loads his marching rifle with a live round, shooting out the soda bottle. Chip Diller, who gradually becomes hysterical, tries to calm the fleeing crowd and is trampled. To top it all off, the Deltas have converted Flounder's brother's Lincoln into a parade float with the words ""EAT ME"" sculpted on the sides. They cut the flowered portion away to reveal the work they did to make the car demonic -- the ""DEATHMOBILE"" -- complete with a turret and train whistle, and ram it into the spectator's bleachers, upsetting the Dean, his wife, the mayor and their guests. Hoover approaches the Dean and asks for one more chance. Finally, the futures of many of the main characters are revealed. The last shot of the film is of Bluto driving away in a white convertible with his soon-to-be wife, Mandy Pepperidge."

But, there, holed up in her secluded riverside cabin, Jennifer is utterly unaware that she has already caught the eye of violent Johnny and his misogynistic jackals, who are hell-bent on having their way with the unsuspecting visitor.

She rents a riverside cabin in upstate New York to work on her novel, attracting the attention of a number of rowdy male locals. They catch Jennifer one day and strip her naked for the village idiot (Matthew) and rape her. Jennifer is later attacked and raped a further two times by the four degenerates, and her novel is also destroyed. But Jennifer recovers, and in her now-twisted, psychotic state, she begins to seek revenge on the men.—Craig Johnson <sis1488@osiris.sis.port.ac.uk> Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) is a short story writer who drives out of her home in New York City to an isolated cottage by a lake in the countryside of upstate New York to write her first novel. The arrival in town of the attractive and independent young woman attracts the attention of Johnny (Eron Tabor), the local gas station owner, and his two friends Stanley (Anthony Nichols) and Andy (Gunter Kleemann), two unemployed youths who hang around the gas station. Jennifer receives a grocery delivery from Matthew (Richard Pace), the local simpleton who is shy and apparently mentally retarded, and befriends him. Matthew is friends with the other three men and reports back to them about the beautiful woman he met, claiming he saw her breasts.The next day, Stanley and Andy start cruising by the cottage in their speedboat and surreptitiously prowl around the house at night while keeping themselves hidden from view. One day, while Jennifer is relaxing in her canoe, they surprise her in their speedboat and tow her to shore. As she tries to escape, she's met by Johnny, while Matthew hides in bushes nearby. She realizes they planned her abduction so Matthew can lose his virginity. Jennifer puts up a fight by punching Johnny, but is chased by the men through the forest. Matthew refuses to have sex with her so Johnny rips off Jennifer's bikini and rapes her. They allow her to escape but track her down shortly afterward and Andy brutally rapes her anally. Matthew again refuses to participate. The four guys flee from the scene of the crime in their speedboat.A little later, after Jennifer crawls back to her house they attack her again. Matthew finally rapes her after drinking alcohol, but says that he can not reach orgasm with the other men watching. The other men ridicule her book and rip up the manuscript, and Stanley sexually assaults Jennifer and rapes her too. When Jennifer scratches at Stanley's face, she is savagely beaten. She passes out on the floor covered in mud from the woods as well as her own blood. With that, the men leave the house. Johnny realizes she is a witness to their crimes and orders Matthew to go back and stab her to death. Matthew cannot bring himself to do it, so he dabs the knife in her blood and returns to the other men claiming he has killed her. The four then take off in their speedboat.Over the next two weeks, a traumatized Jennifer pieces both herself and her manuscript back together. She silently sits around her house, chain-smoking, and avoids looking into mirrors to avoid seeing her maimed face now sporting some permanent scars and ugly bruises from her beating. She goes to a church and asks for forgiveness, vowing to kill all four of the men who violated her. One day, the men learn Jennifer has survived and they beat Matthew up for lying to them about killing her.Jennifer then begins spying on her assailants first by following Matthew home from the local grocery store to his parents house, and the next day she follows Johnny home from the garage to his house where he has a wife and two young children.One day, Jennifer calls in a grocery order knowing Matthew will deliver it. Hearing that it's from Jennifer's address, he takes the groceries, and a knife he steals from the grocery store butcher unsure of what Jennifer plans to do with him. At the cabin, Matthew arrives where Jennifer entices him to have sex with her under a tree. As he becomes oblivious to his surroundings, she strings a noose around his neck and hangs him. Matthews struggles, but is slowly strangled to death as Jennifer watches with a wicked-looking facial expression. Jennifer cuts the rope and drops the dead body in the river. She then pushes his bicycle into the river and the groceries he brought as well. Jennifer then phones the grocery store to report that Matthew never arrived with her order.The next day, Jennifer drives over to the gas station and seductively collects Johnny from the place and entices him to join her in her car. She stops on the road halfway to her house where she gets out of the car, and points a gun at him, ordering that he remove all his clothing. The clearly misogynist Johnny insists the rapes were her fault because she enticed the men by parading around in revealing clothing. She feigns belief in Johnny's ludicrous rant, lowers her gun, and invites him back to her cottage for a hot bath.While taking a bath together, Jennifer manually stimulates him in her bathtub. When Johnny says that Matthew has been reported missing, Jennifer says she killed Matthew. Johnny thinks she is joking. As he nears orgasm, Jennifer takes the butcher knife Matthew brought with him from its hiding place under the bathmat and severs Johnny's genitals. He screams in terror while bleeding to death. Jennifer calmly drops the knife in the bathroom sink, leaves the room and locks Johnny in from the outside. He dies from blood loss. Jennifer dumps Johnny's dead body in the basement and burns his clothes in the fireplace.The following day, Stanley and Andy learn that Johnny is missing from his wife. They take their speedboat to Jennifer's cabin aware that she might have killed him and Matthew. Andy goes ashore with an axe looking for Jennifer, while she swims out to the boat and climbs aboard before Stanley realizes what she is doing. She pushes him overboard and Stanley has trouble staying afloat for he is not a good swimmer. Andy tries to attack her when she speeds past him in the boat, but she escapes with the axe. Andy swims out to rescue Stanley but Jennifer plunges the axe into Andy's back, killing him. She backs the boat up to Stanley who grabs hold of the motor to climb aboard, begging Jennifer not to kill him. Looking down on her former assailant with very cold eyes, Jennifer instead smirks at Stanley and quotes what he said while assaulting her: ""Suck it, bitch!"" and starts the engine, disemboweling him underwater. As Andy and Stanley's dead bodies sink beneath the surface of the water, the murderous Jennifer smiles slightly as she speeds away in the boat."
Watership Down,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078480/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Hoping to escape destruction by human developers and save their community, a colony of rabbits, led by Hazel and Fiver, seek out a safe place to set up a new warren. Based upon Richard Adam's novel of the same title, this animated feature delves into the surprisingly violent world of a warren of rabbits as they seek to establish a new colony free of tyranny and human intervention.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> Underneath a small patch of land cloaked in tall grass somewhere in a dark warren of the lush English countryside, Fiver, a skittish prescient rabbit, having shared his hauntingly vivid nightmares of destruction with his brother, Hazel, instigates a mass exodus in search of a safe new home. However, the journey to greener pastures is as long as it is precarious, entangling the audacious furry settlers in an endless string of shockingly unknown and devastating perils, which include not only voracious predators, but also betrayal and the mighty weapons of men. Is this the future the Lapine pilgrims have been dreaming of at the promised Watership Down Hill, especially when the ghastly warren chief, General Woundwort, awaits at the end of the line?—Nick Riganas With this passion project, screenwriter-producer-director [url=nm0742034] brilliantly achieved what had been thought nearly impossible: a faithful big-screen adaptation of [url=nm0011293]'s classic British dystopian novel about a community of rabbits under terrible threat from modern forces. With its naturalistic hand-drawn animation, dreamily expressionistic touches, gorgeously bucolic background design, and elegant voice work from such superb English actors as [url=nm0000457], [url=nm0724732], [url=nm0001972], and nm0001186, Watership Down is an emotionally arresting, dark-toned allegory about freedom amid political turmoil. In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a young runt rabbit who is a seer, receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction. When he and his loving brother, Hazel, fail to convince their chief of the need to evacuate; they set out on their own with a small band of others who heeded the warning and barely manage to elude the Warren's military caste. What follows is a perilous journey in which the band faces dangers of all varieties like predators, humans and even their own kind. While they eventually find a peaceful new home at Watership Down, they have new problems that will lead to a deadly conflict with the neighboring Warren called Efrafa, which is a police state by the powerful and insane General Woundwart.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) The story begins with a prologue, narrated byMichael Hordern, establishing the Lapine culture and mythology and describing the creation of the world and its animals by Lord Frith, the sun god. All the animals co-exist peacefully and eat grass together but the rabbits, led by Prince El-ahrairah, quickly multiply and overwhelm the other animals with their insatiable hunger. When Frith warns El-ahrairah to control his people, the prince scoffs at him, claiming that his are the strongest people in the land. In retaliation, Frith gives to each of the other animals a gift, turning them into predators, or 'elil' that hunt and feed on the rabbits. However, Frith also bestows upon the rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning, enabling them a fighting chance against their enemies. All creatures may seek to kill El-ahrairah and his descendants but, with their wits and quickness, the rabbits may survive.The film then transitions to realistic animation and brings us to the English countryside of Sandleford. Fiver (Richard Briers), a young runt rabbit with prophetic abilities, foresees the end of his peaceful rabbit warren during an afternoon grazing, or 'silflay'. He exclaims to his older brother, Hazel (John Hurt), that the field they live on is covered in blood, but Hazel acknowledges the image as a trickery of the sunset. Regardless, he agrees to take Fiver to the Chief Rabbit to see if they can have the warren evacuated. However, the Chief Rabbit (Ralph Richardson) dismisses them, saying that leaving the warren in the height of the mating season is preposterous enough without it being based on a young rabbit's prophecy. Knowing that his brother's visions have always come to light in the past, Hazel helps Fiver gather any rabbits willing to leave the warren and they all sneak away during the night. They are briefly stopped by Captain Holly (John Bennett) of the Owsla, the rabbit police force, but they manage to fight past him. As they leave the safety of the warren, they pass a sign clearly stating that the lands of their home is due for residential development.In all, eight rabbits successfully defect: Fiver, Hazel, ex-Owsla officer Bigwig (Michael Graham Cox), cunning Blackberry (Simon Cadell), small Pipkin (Roy Kinnear), storyteller and runner Dandelion (Richard O'Callaghan), old Silver (Terence Rigby), and the only female, Violet. They travel into the woods and through the night, encountering dangers such as owls and a large badger, or 'lendri'. Their curiosity is aroused when they stumble upon a road and Blackberry explains that 'hrududu' travel on it but have no interest in rabbits. He proves this by sitting still as one of them, a car, approaches and speeds on by. However, the threat of being killed by such wayward creatures is made apparent when Blackberry is nearly hit by another. A bean field provides some shelter and the rabbits are able to rest. Come morning, Fiver wakes to see Violet leave the safety of the plants to feed on grass and watches in horror as a hawk swoops down and carries her off.One less, they move along and come to a creek in time to hear that there's a dog loose in the woods. With the dog on their scent, and Fiver and Pipkin unable to swim, the larger rabbits use a plank of wood to float them across, swimming alongside. They find refuge that night within a crypt in an old cemetery but are set upon by a band of black rats which draws the attention of an owl. The rabbits escape. The following day they meet a friendly, but odd, rabbit named Cowslip (Denholm Elliott) who offers them food and shelter at his warren. The group is grateful for the hospitality they receive and all but Fiver consider remaining at the warren permanently. He senses something terribly wrong and tries to warn the others of it but they refuse to listen. He leaves in a fit, followed by Bigwig who taunts him before suddenly being caught in a snare trap. Bigwig collapses and begins to choke as the others frantically try to dig out the post the snare is attached to. He coughs blood and appears to stop breathing just as the post is removed. The rabbits mourn their loss as Fiver admonishes them: the warren is given food and protection from a nearby farmer who has laid numerous deadly snares throughout the warren as his price. After this terrifying revelation, Bigwig miraculously recovers and, on Fiver's advice, the band moves on with a new found respect for the seer's wisdom.Eventually, the rabbits come to Nuthanger Farm where Hazel discovers a hutch of female rabbits. Knowing that does will be needed to start a new warren, but deterred by the farm's dog and cat, he promises a young doe named Clover (Mary Maddox) that he will return. As the rabbits move alongside a field, they spot a fox, or 'homba', sniffing out their trail. Bigwig runs out to draw its attention away to the shelter of the woods nearby. The others hear a cry and think Bigwig has been caught but he soon returns and hurries them on, explaining that he ran into a couple of rabbits that tried to stop him despite his warning of the fox. It was presumably one of the rabbits that cried out when the fox caught up.The band continues onward until they find Captain Holly, badly injured and at the brink of death. He briefly recounts the destruction of the Sandleford warren as Fiver predicted, witnessing as the ground was turned up and how he was forced to leave his fellow rabbits within their burrows to suffocate to death by noxious fumes. He mentions a warren called Efrafa before he collapses. Once rested, Fiver leads the group to the place he envisioned, a hill called Watership Down where the rabbits discover empty burrows suitable to live in beneath the shelter of a great tree. They all settle in with Hazel informally recognized as Chief Rabbit. One day, an acerbic seagull crash lands on the warren, his wing injured and leaving him unable to fly. Hazel, seeing the potential of using the gull's skills of flight, offers to help him despite the gull's stubborn pride. Kehaar (Zero Mostel) is allowed to rest at the warren and, as Hazel hoped, notices with disdain the lack of female rabbits and 'chicks'. He berates the rabbits for not keeping a better warren but eagerly agrees to survey the area for females once his wing heals. When he manages to take flight, Hazel opts to return to Nuthanger Farm with two other rabbits to try and free the caged does.Hazel and Blackberry make it to the barn and start chewing away at the hinges to the doe's crate while Dandelion keeps watch. However, he inadvertently alerts the dog and farmer to their presence just as the crate door is broken open. The farmer wrangles up the does as the other rabbits try to escape. Hazel is hit in his hindquarter by shotgun pellets as they flee and Blackberry and Dandelion are forced to leave him behind. They return to the warren to tell Fiver of his brother's demise, sentimentally stating that the Black Rabbit of Inle, 'death', does no more than his appointed task. However, seeing a vision of the Black Rabbit, Fiver claims his brother is not dead and follows the vision to an old pipe where a trail of blood leads to Hazel, his heart still beating.Kehaar returns to Watership Down and helps remove the buckshot pellets from Hazel's hindquarters, using his beak. He speaks of the Efrafa warren nearby which houses many rabbits. Holly pipes up and warns the other rabbits not to go there; it is a dangerous warren ruled tyrannically by a chief named General Woundwort (Harry Andrews). It was Woundwort's Owsla that injured Holly and, were it not for the brave actions of a doe named Hyzenthlay (Hannah Gordon) and the appearance of one of Frith's 'messengers' (a train that cuts down pursuing Owsla), he would never have escaped. Bigwig offers to infiltrate the warren. Arriving at Efrafa as a newcomer wishing to join, he impresses General Woundwort and is offered a familiar spot on the warren's Owsla as an officer with the option of choosing a female for himself. He meets with Hyzenthlay and tells her of his free warren. In time, they recruit other defectors including Blackavar, a rabbit with several bodily scars and bitten ears, severely maimed for his many escape attempts.After meeting with Kehaar and relaying his plans to leave that very night, Bigwig is confronted by General Woundwort who overheard Kehaar's loud calls. Bigwig manages to convince him that their talk was of no concern, though Woundwort remains suspicious. That night, as a thunderstorm approaches, Bigwig takes his band of Efrafans and escapes. However, the ever-vigilant Efrafan Owsla gives chase, led by General Woundwort. A timed attack by Kehaar keeps the General at bay while the rabbits make way for the river. Echoing their earlier use of driftwood, the rabbits leap into a small boat and break off the moor just as the Owsla arrive at the banks. Bigwig and the other defectors safely drift downstream and make their way to Watership Down.However, several days later, their trail is picked up again by Efrafan trackers and General Woundwort vows vengeance on Bigwig. As an unknown to Woundwort, Hazel approaches the Efrafans to negotiate. He offers an alliance of free and independent warrens living peacefully together, but Woundwort casts his intrigue aside and dismisses Hazel, ordering him to tell Bigwig to surrender the defectors. Hazel returns to his warren and instructs all the rabbits to hole up inside their burrows and block the entrances as the Efrafans begin their assault. Panic-stricken, Fiver falls into a trance, moaning as he envisions a 'dog loose in the woods'. His sounds briefly scare the Efrafans and inspires Hazel to formulate a plan. He brings with him the fastest runners; Hyzenthlay, Blackberry, and Dandelion, and they escape the warren. Woundwort orders his Owsla to ignore them, intent on finding Bigwig whom he believes to be the chief rabbit.On their way, Hazel prays to Frith and offers his life in return for the safety of the warren, but Frith replies that it is a bargain he cannot honor. Along the way, he positions each of the rabbits at different intervals until he and Dandelion arrive at Nuthanger Farm. Dandelion exclaims that, if they succeed, theirs will be the greatest story ever told. Hazel assures him that he will be the one to tell it as he makes his way towards the farmer's dog, sleeping in its dog house. Hazel chews away at the dog's leash as Dandelion draws its attention. The dog chases after Dandelion as Hazel is pounced upon by the farmer's cat (Lynn Farleigh). However, the farmer's daughter, Lucy (Michelle Price), orders her cat to let the rabbit alone and Hazel is freed.The dog, meanwhile, is led by the rabbits in relay fashion back to Watership Dow; the plan nearly goes awry with the dog stops to urinate and nearly finds the last, and exhausted, runner before Hyzenthlay is able to get the dog's attention to continue the final leg of the relay. Meanwhile, General Woundwort makes his way inside the burrows, fiercely killing Blackavar after he attacks Woundwort in a delaying tactic. In a last-ditch effort to protect the warren, Bigwig buries himself beneath the dirt of one of the tunnels and, as Woundwort approaches, lunges out in surprise and attacks him. The rabbits ferociously bite and scratch at each other until they are both bloodied. Woundwort asks why Bigwig won't simply surrender and Bigwig responds that his chief ordered him to protect the warren. Woundwort hesitates, surprised that Bigwig is not chief and imagines that he now has a larger rabbit to reckon with. At that moment, the dog arrives at the warren and begins tearing the Efrafan Owsla apart. They all scream and scatter as Woundwort emerges out of the warren and curses them for their cowardice, claiming that dogs aren't dangerous. He then sees the dog come out from behind the tree, dropping a dead Efrafan from its mouth before it charges towards him. Woundwort fearlessly leaps to confront the dog and it is said that, after this encounter, his body was never found and he wasn't heard from again. His legacy lives on as a story that does tell to their kittens as a way to keep them obedient; that if they misbehave, General Woundwort will get them. For all the menace that tyrant was, the general opinion is that he would have found that kind of monument pleasing in its own way.In epilogue, an elderly Hazel settles in to silflay when he is visited by a shadowy phantom, revealed as Prince El-ahrairah in the form of the Black Rabbit of Inle. El-ahrairah suggests that Hazel has been feeling tired of late and offers him a place with his Owsla. When Hazel looks back warily on his family at the warren, El-ahrairah assures him that they, and future generations, will be safe. Reassured, Hazel lays down in the grass and peacefully passes away. His spirit leaves his body and follows El-ahrairah through the woodland and into the afterlife.""All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies. And whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first, they must catch you; digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed."""
Days of Heaven,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077405/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hot-tempered farm laborer convinces the woman he loves to marry their rich but dying boss so that they can have a claim to his fortune. Bill and Abby, a young couple who to the outside world pretend to be brother and sister are living and working in Chicago at the beginning of the century.

Together with the girl Linda (who acts as the narrator in the movie) they find employment on a farm in the Texas panhandle. When the harvest is over the young, rich and handsome farmer invites them to stay because he has fallen in love with Abby.

She runs into her friend from the fields who has a new boyfriend. He's in the Army. Maybe he'll get killed or something. I don't know. Anyway, he said I'm pretty. They race away and chat at the railroad tracks, and then walk down the rails towards an uncertain future. Linda narrates This girl, she didn't know where she was goin' or what she was goin' to do. She didn't have no money on her. Maybe she'd meet up with a character. I was hopin' things would work out for her. She was a good friend of mine."

Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080391/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of scientists band together to save the world from mutated killer tomatoes. After a wave of reports of mysterious attacks involving people and pets being eaten by the traditionally docile fruit, a special government task force is set up to investigate the violent fruit and put a stop to their murderous spree. Included in this crack team are a lieutenant who never goes anywhere without his parachute, an underwater expert who's never out of his scuba gear, and a master of disguise who conceals his appearance by dressing as a black Adolf Hitler.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released, audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity, but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975, no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the opening credits, the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood, but tomato juice.A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato, a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato, and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers in a bay area of San Diego, in a parody of 'Jaws').While the President's press secretary, Jim Richardson, tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat, the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a Euro-American man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, an African-American disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Euro-American Navy diver Greg Colburn; Central-Russo Russian Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and Euro-American parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could ""pass the ketchup"". Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason.Meanwhile, the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency ""Mind Makers,"" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with ""STP"" for ""Stop Tomato Program"" on it, a satirical reference to the real ""whip inflation now"" campaign and its widely ridiculed ""WIN"" slogan. It is revealed that a human is also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him, but misses.A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor who sends reporter Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the west coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died when he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin on foot until he is knocked out when it is revealed that Richardson is behind the tomatoes. He is about to reveal his secret of control when Finletter charges in and runs him through. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that both times the tomatoes left him the new hit song ""Puberty Love"" had been on the radio. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium, which is soon attacked by the tomatoes.The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. ""Puberty Love"" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to ""Puberty Love."" He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the Earth and says ""All right, you guys. They're gone now.""The end credits title card appears which is a joke to stay tuned for the sequel, ""Attack of the Killer Carrots""."
Felicity,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079144/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Teenager Felicity studies at a remote Roman Catholic Church boarding school and seeks indulgence in popular erotic novels Story of O, Emmanuelle and in a lesbian love affair with her friend Jenny. Teenager Felicity studies at a remote Roman Catholic Church boarding school and seeks indulgence in popular erotic novels Story of O, Emmanuelle and in a lesbian love affair with her friend Jenny. Her father arranges her holiday trip to Hong Kong where she will stay with a wealthy couple, Christine and Stephen. Christine organizes a party at their mansion to introduce her to a friend of theirs, Andrew. After the party, Andrew takes Felicity for a ride in his car during which he pulls over and deflowers her. Christine also introduces her to libertine Me Ling. She initiates Felicity to new pleasures. However, Felicity eventually falls in love with Miles who saves her from a bunch of Chinese thugs. This film is basically the Australian version of the famed late night cable films ""Emmanuelle"", which ironically in the film Felicity is reading that book and refers to a couple of times in her narration. While it does have a plot, naïve Felicity discovering herself and her budding sexuality, it is basically soft-core porn with better dialogue and better acting. All in all it's not a bad film, I would recommend it to fans of the ""Emmanuelle"" series.—Brandon Byrnes"

Vance grabs the knife and the doll that he is holding loses its head. The deranged Vance screams: ""you killed my Cathy!"" Vance lunghes at Kent and onto the knife and falls to the floor.

But Akton manages to revive and kill Thor, but is too late as the sun has already set, and the surface of the planet freezes solid. Elle, being a robot, is able to help Stella stay alive by keeping her in a suspended state sequence. Upon daylight, Akton is able to venture outside to bring both Elle and the frozen Stella back onto the ship where she is de-thawed and revealed to have survived.At last, Stella Starr's starship arrives at the third and last planet where the third and final escape pod landed, which is right on the Count's secret planet. After surviving the Count's mental weapon, Stella and her crew land the ship to search for the final crash site. But Stella and Elle get attacked by a savage group of barbarian tribesmen who hack Elle to pieces and abduct Stella. But she escapes and flees to a nearby cave where she is met by Simon (David Hasseloff), who is revealed to be the sole survivor of the crash, and the Emperor's son. Akton arrives having fought his way through the barbarians and gets into a light saber duel with Simon, unaware of his origins. But Simon proves his bio origins to the Emperor and the trio then set off to find the Count's secret weapon which is right on the planet.Arriving at an underground lab, Stella, Akton and Simon are caught by the Count's men where the Count, finally meeting the group face-to-face, reveals his intentions of using them for bait to bring the Emperor to the planet and have his weapon self-destruct, destroying everybody while he makes his escape to conquer the Emperor's homeworld to have the title to Emperor for himself. The Count and his men depart, leaving behind the Count's two personal bodyguard Golum robots to guard Stella, Akton, and Simon to make sure they don't follow him. Akton engages the two robots in a lightsaber fight, but gets mortally wounded in destroying the two robots. The Emperor arrives with his personal army where, aware that the whole planet is mined with nuclear bombs, he uses a special weapon to block the bomb timers long enough to help Stella and Simon make it back to the ship before they detonate and destroy the whole planet. Upon arriving back at the Emperor's battleship, Stella is relived to see that Elle is alive, after being found by the Emperor's men who put him back together.Observing alongside the Emperor on the bridge of his flagship, Stella watches a huge space battle begin as the Emperor launches an attack against the Count's massive space station just as the Count is launching an attack against the Emperor's homeworld. But the attack is a failure. After an initial start, the Emperor's soldiers storm the Count's space station, gaining a foothold in a long laser-gun battle. But the Count arrives with massive reinforcements which all of the outnumbered Emperor's solders are overwhelmed and killed.With no other options left, the Emperor decides the only way to stop the Count is a star crash: to fly a whole space station into the Count's space station to destroy it. Stella and Elle volunteer to commandeer an abandoned space city to fly into the Count's space station to destroy it. Stella and Elle manage to escape from the space city's bridge by flying out into space, just as it crashes into the Count's space station destroying it and the Count as well, finally winning the war. Stella and Elle are picked up by the Emperor's son, Simon, who is finally overjoyed that Stella survived once again and they agree to get married and begin a new era of peace for the galaxy."

John Morlar (Richard Burton) is watching a British television broadcast when an anchorman states that American astronauts are trapped in orbit around the moon. Suddenly someone in Morlar's room picks up a figurine and strikes him on the head repeatedly. His blood splatters the television screen. French Detective-Inspector Brunel (Lino Ventura) arrives at Morlar's apartment to begin an investigation. At first he thinks Morlar is dead, but soon he hears him breathe. At the hospital, Morlar is hooked up to life support systems, one machine in particular monitors the activity of his battered brain. Brunel discovers that Morlar has been in psychological analysis because of his history of being witness to many disasters, other people's disasters. Dr. Zonfeld (Lee Remick), Morlar's analyst, explains that Morlar's delusions had begun when he was a child. He believed that he had caused a hated nanny's death. Morlar's childhood delusions were reinforced at a resort when he overheard his parents discussing him with disapproval. When his parents strolled on top of a cliff, Morlar watched as the family car suddenly pushed them off the cliff to their deaths. One evening, Brunel pores over the mysteries of Morlar's diary and through his scrapbook of disastrous events. Gradually, Brunel begins to develop an opinion of what Morlar was like and begins to wonder if he is chasing a murderer or a victim.—alfiehitchie Chaos and destruction are all around as crews continue the clean up from an airliner crash city center last night. Tonight, we find ourselves in writer John Morlar's (Richard Burton) apartment, as he intently watches TV coverage of a NASA space mission going awry. As his intense eyes stare at the impending doom for the astronauts, his chair is suddenly spun around and his head is repeatedly and brutally beaten by an attacker from behind camera. Just prior to the beating, Morlar's eyes look right into the attacker's and he calmly says ""a response at last"".An investigation into the beating death has the detectives shocked to find that Morlar has survived barely, and they rush him to the hospital. He has his head totally bandaged (except for eyes and nose) and is plugged into multiple machines and monitors, hoses, tubes, etc. Obviously he is in the ICU, and here he stays for the rest of the movie.We follow the detectives' investigation into the beating at Morlar's apartment; how he lives, gets along with neighbors, his traits; his artwork, furnishings, his writings, etc. His writings are cryptic, obscure, dark and ominous, dealing with many past catastrophies and disasters. The detectives find that Morlar had been seeing a psychologist.They find the psychologist, Dr. Zonfeld (Lee Remmick) and try to discover what's up with Morlar. They find that he felt like he had some kind of power to create catastrophe. Zonfeld doesn't give much to the detectives other than to state he was delusional, so they go back to the apartment and hospital to dig up some more info.Morlar's hand trembles and he's given a pencil...he writes a warning about the old cathedral wall, which had been cracking lately, causing much worry about a collapse. Detectives think there is more to learn from Zonfeld.From this next visit to Zonfeld, the story is told through flashbacks from Zonfeld's and Morlar's points of view while she was interviewing, analyzing Morlar. She reveals that he felt he had caused the deaths of many people that had wronged him in the past. His nanny, his parents, his school professor, his estranged wife and her boyfriend. He felt that he learned that he could cause almost any type of catastrophe. She still claimed to the detectives that she felt it was all in his head, a delusion. She seems disinterested in his case and makes the police feel that there was no worry from her about the validity of his claims.Morlar's almost flatline brain activity ocasiionally gets a blip or two when his hand wants to warn of the collapse of the wall, so the detectives really watch him close. A bit more pressure on Zonfeld, and she accompanies the police to the hospital. Seing Morlar causes her to confess that Morlar's claims had begun to seem possible, and he had actually gotten her to come to his apartment. She witnessed him stare at the airliner as it took off, and watched it fly straight into the city center as he stared it to it's death.The detective believes now that Zonfeld has more to do with this, and goes back to her place the next day, to find her dead, from a self-induced injection. She left a taped confession that she had tried to kill him, to prevent the space disaster, but had failed. She has now convinced the detective that Morlar could cause these disasters.As police watch morlar in the hospital, the cathedral wall begins to crumble just as the Queen is arriving for a visit. Police rush all around trying to prevent death and destruction, but only our detective knows what is the cause. He rushes back to the hospital to remove the life support from Morlar. As Morlar's little jiggles and wiggles on the brain monitor fade, the falling cathedral catastrophe wanes and we sigh relief that it has all ended.The police look at Morlar's flatlined body, and are about to leave when the EEG monitor begins to make creepy squeaky sounds, and the flatline becomes very active.

Force 10 from Navarone,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077572/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During World War II, several oddly assorted military experts are teamed in a mission to raid and destroy a bridge vital to enemy strategy. Mallory and Miller are back. It seems that there was traitor with them at Navarone, whom they thought was executed. But it seems that not only was he not executed, and he was not a traitor but a German spy. Intelligence believes he made it to Yugoslavia and is now with the Partisans. So, Mallory and Miller being the only ones who can positively identify him are sent along with a unit called Force 10, which is led by Colonel Barnsby, who objects to their presence. It seems that Force 10 has a mission of their own which Mallory and Miller know nothing about. When their plane is shot and most of the team is killed, they mistakenly believe that some of the locals they meet are Partisans but in reality are German Allies, so they are taken prisoner, and have to convince the German commander that they are not spies or else they will be killed.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> In the darkest days of World War II, Hitler's armies are storming through Europe, annihilating all opposition in their path. But U.S. Colonel Barnsby plots to strike a crippling blow to the brutal Nazi forces. To succeed, he'll need the help of the most skilled and lethal soldiers in the world: the Force 10 squad, fresh from its triumphant mission at Navarone. But when the team's plan goes awry in a firestorm of blistering battles, Barnsby and the squad's hard-driving Major Mallory are forced to devise a new and even more dangerous scheme to attack the Nazi war machine . . . or risk losing the rest of Europe to its awesome, destructive power.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> In 1943, after their successful mission in Navarone, MI6 agents Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill ""Nicolai"". Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be a dedicated German spy, and is believed to be disguised among the Yugoslav Partisans as a Captain Lescovar (Franco Nero). Mallory and Miller's new mission is to get to Yogoslavia, find Nicolai, and kill him.To get to Yugoslavia the two men pair with ""Force 10"", an American sabotage unit led by Lt. Col. Barnsby (Harrison Ford) and having with its own mission in German-occupied Yugoslavia. To maximize security, Force 10 steals a plane from Termoli Airfield in Italy rather than requisitioning one, but are spotted by US M.Ps before takeoff. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MP's, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully ""escape"" Termoli only to be shot down by German night fighters over Yugoslavia. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver and Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane.On the ground, the five survivors run across a group they believe to be Communist Yugoslav Partisans, their allies. Led by a hulking Yugoslav named Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel), Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody, but do not know what their mission is. Mallory and Barnsby tell the German commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are deserters and criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a ""new"" drug called penicillin.The next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Mallory and Barnsby improvise, ""admitting"" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends Mallory and Barnsby out to retrieve them, under the guard of his concubine, Maritza (Barbara Bach), and three of his soldiers. Miller, Weaver and Reynolds are left in a cell in camp.Far from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan spy. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the real partisans under the command of her father, Major Petrovich (Alan Badel). Mallory and Barnsby escape, ambushing and killing two of Drazak's Chetniks - men bandaged to hide burns from flamethrowers. Eventually, the two meet a patrol of real Yugoslav Partisans led by a man Mallory recognizes as his target Captain Lescovar, AKA: Nicolai. While Mallory assumes that Lescovar has recognized him, he and Barnsby are nevertheless taken to the partisans. Mallory and Barnsby both realize their location when they recognize a wide river and a large hydroelectric dam near the Partisan camp.Skeptical, Major Petrovich dismisses Mallory's story about Lescovar being Nicolai - assuring Mallory that they had executed the real 'Nicolai' months earlier. He reproves the men for killing the bandaged Chetniks, as the men were partisan infiltrators in the Chetnik camp and his only link to Maritza.Petrovich's principle worry is an impending assault by the Wehrmacht. The Germans are massing their forces nearby, and only a ravine separates as many as three German divisions from the outnumbered partisans. Only a single concrete arch bridge links each side of the ravine, but the partisans have been unable to destroy it. Convinced that no bridge is impregnable, Barnsby reveals that this bridge is in fact Force 10's target. Knowing Miller's expertise in demolitions, Mallory convinces a reluctant Petrovich to help mount a rescue mission using Lescovar and the Partisan Marko (Petar Buntic).The four re-enter the camp at night, Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives and the partisans disguised as the bandaged men. Before they complete their mission, Drazak arrives with the bodies of the real bandaged men and, since Maritza had always been seen with them, concludes she was a partisan as well and savagely beats her up. A gun battle breaks out in the cell block. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed, but Mallory, Barnsby, Miller, Weaver, Lescovar and Marko escape in a truck with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives.Having made it to the Partisans, Miller reveals that the bridge really is impregnable to explosives. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam they saw earlier, with the sudden onrush of several millions of gallons of water being enough to destroy the bridge. A night time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar sabotages the air drop by calling in German planes. Maritza spots Lescovar betraying the partisans, but Lescovar kills her before she can warn the others. German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone.Petrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to Marshall Tito's headquarters for transport back to Italy. The team decides to infiltrate the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives, taking Lescovar and Marko. Lescovar again betrays them alerting a German sergeant to their presence, identifying himself as an Abwehr officer. Marko overhears the plan and sacrifices himself to save the others from the Germans. The others escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar's hasty cover story doesn't fool Mallory or Barnsby; Barnsby had observed Lescovar's interactions with the German sergeant who, fatally, salutes the other man even though Lescovar's uniform only made him out to be a corporal; Mallory had noticed a map showing that their train passes within a half-mile of the dam - a fact Lescovar ""neglected"" to bring up. Though Lescovar denies treachery, Mallory is convinced, and he kills Lescovar.Jumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver set off diversionary explosives while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Drazak in the woods, and kills him after a knife fight.Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam, but realize that they are out of time. With the German assault only minutes away - they are forced to set a short fuse, leaving them no time to escape. Mallory and Barnsby are caught in the explosion, yet nevertheless survive. The dam appears undamaged, but soon begins to disintegrate; with its barely maintained structural integrity disrupted, the dam wall collapses, releasing millions of tons of water in a wave that topples the bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving the Partisans. Mallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but the jubilation is short-lived. Mallory reminds the men that they're now trapped on the wrong side of the river, with no supplies and no way of contacting or reaching the partisans. As the end credits roll, the four men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly lines.In this movie appearsWolf Kahlerwho will later play Ludendorff, chemist and Fritz Shimon Haber's close friend inHaber (2008)."
The Wild Geese,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078492/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A British banker hires a group of British mercenaries to rescue a deposed African President from the hands of a corrupt African dictator. A British multinational seeks to overthrow a vicious dictator in central Africa. It hires a band of (largely aged) mercenaries in London and sends them in to save the virtuous but imprisoned opposition leader.—Richard Young <richy@vnu.co.uk> Amidst violent political turmoil in central Africa, the nefarious London merchant banker named Sir Edward Matheson hires a loyal band of seasoned middle-aged mercenaries led by the fearless Colonel Allen Faulkner, to rescue the deposed African President, Julius Limbani. With Limbani imprisoned and presumed dead by his followers, the determined Colonel along with a small army of hand-picked paratroops parachute into the hostile Zembala to fight for the wounded leader's freedom, unaware that there has been a change of plans behind their backs. Can Faulkner's men make their escape from the sun-roasted wasteland with General Ndofa's vicious Simbas after them?—Nick Riganas Colonel Allen Faulkner (Richard Burton), a middle-aged British mercenary and former Royal Army officer, arrives in London from Switzerland to meet the rich and ruthless merchant banker Sir Edward Matherson (Stewart Granger) at his West London row-house. The latter proposes an operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), imprisoned former leader of the fictitious central African country of Zembalia, who is due to be killed by the military dictator who overthrew him. Limbani, whose people believe he is already dead, is being held in a remote prison, guarded by ferocious African troops known as the ""Simbas"", under General Ndofa.Faulkner provisionally accepts the assignment and sets about recruiting his officers, all of whom have worked with him on previous African operations. They comprise:Lt. Shaun Fynn (Roger Moore) is a former RAF pilot. He is working as a currency smuggler, but when he realizes that he's actually running drugs, he kills the mafia drug dealer and consequently has a death contract placed in his head. Matherson forces the crime boss to lift the contract at the last moment.Lt. Pieter Coetzee (Hardy Krüger), is a South African mercenary who only wants to return to his homeland and buy a farm, but can barely afford to pay his rent in London.Captain Rafer Janders (Richard Harris) is hired as an experienced mission planner. He initially refuses the job, as he's making some money as an art dealer and is planning a Christmas vacation with his son, Emile. But Faulkner persuades Janders to join the mission as the tactician.Retired R.S.M (Regimental Sergeant Major) Sandy Young (Jack Watson), is asked by Faulkner to serve as drill sergeant to train the troops and assist in recruitment. He is very willing, but his wife strongly disapproves.With the tacit approval and support of the British government, the 50 soldiers are transported to an unspecified African location, equipped and mercilessly trained by Young. The day before the mission is to begin, Janders exacts a promise from Faulkner to watch over his son Emile, and take care of him should Janders die on the mission. Faulkner agrees.The 50-man mercenary group are transported by plane and parachuted into the African country near Zembala Prison on Christmas Day. Coetzee uses a powerful crossbow with cyanide-tipped quarrels to take out the prison sentries. The rest of the guards are killed silently with cyanide gas. They rescue Limbani, but he is clearly a sick man and is later hit by crossfire during the battle. All of the Simba guards, along with one Cuban Army officer and advisor, are killed in the battle. The group, suffering no casualties, then commandeers several jeeps and other military vehicles from the prison and makes its way to a small airfield to await pickup.But backers of the project, led by Matherson, reach an agreement with the Zembalese government concerning valuable copper mining concessions, and the airplane due to collect them is recalled at the last minute.From this point onward, the abandoned mercenaries are forced to fight their way through hostile territory, pursued by the Simbas. It is also revealed here that Cuban, Soviet and East German army officers are training and advising the Simbas on their fighting skills and giving them orders to take out all of the foreign mercs.Meanwhile, the relationship between Limbani and Coetzee develops from initial animosity: ""I bleed red like you, white man; don't call me kaffir"" to one of understanding, as Coetzee comes to understand and appreciate Limbani's struggle, and realizes that white and black must work together.As they make their way south, heading for Limbani's home tribal land, they approach an old rickety wooden bridge. Only the first few vehicles make it across, when they come under aerial attack by a Simba fighter bomber aircraft that drops napalm. The bridge collapses under the weight of a fuel tanker, leaving the last jeep stranded on the northern river bank. In that jeep is Limbani, Coetzee, and medical orderly Arthur Whity (Kenneth Griffith).The mercenaries separate into two groups to continue to make their way to Limbani's home village, where they intend to provoke a revolution. However, most of the allied rebels are too ill-equipped and weak to fight. During all of this, Faulkner is forced to kill his own men who are gravely injured by the airstrike. Coetzee observes, ""we can't leave them to the Simbas"", whom will torture them to death.Coetzee is then killed while saving Limbani from a Simba ambush, leaving another soldier, a young Nigerian named Sgt. Jesse Link (John Kani), to carry Limbani. Witty is killed by machete-armed Simbas while trying to fend off another ambush, allowing the rest of the platoon to escape. Faulkner is reunited with the rest of the remaining 32 mercenaries at Limbani's village where an Irish missionary, named Father Geoghegen (Frank Finley), alerts them to the presence of an aging transport plane, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain aka ""Dakota"" at an old runway to provide for their escape.At the airfield, the mercs make their last stand in a climatic battle. As the masses of Simba troops attack, the group guns down dozens of attacking Simbas, while transporting the wounded Limbani on a stretcher to the plane, but many mercs are killed in the fierce battle, including the teenage soldier Esposito (Glyn Baker). Sandy Young is killed while he is running with Faulkner to board the airplane. Faulkner makes it on board, along with the tough gung-ho merc Tosh Donaldson (Ian Yule). Jesse Link also manages to safely get on board with several mercenaries carrying Limbani. While in the cockpit reading the plane for takeoff, Fynn is shot in his left leg, but manages to keep the plane moving. The last remaining mercs, including a wounded Jock McTaggart (Ronald Fraser), manage to board, but Janders is badly wounded after getting shot in his left side and can't get onto the moving plane; he implores Faulkner to shoot him as he is running down the runway with mobs of Simba troops in chase right behind him. Faulkner cannot bear to shoot his friend, but there is no hope. As Janders cries out his son's name: ""Emile! Emile!"", Faulkner reluctantly shoots and kills him just as the plane takes off.The plane with the wounded Limbani and the surviving mercenaries, numbering only 13 men out of the original 50, is initially refused landing permission in nearby Rhodesia, but after they provide proof that Limbani is aboard, they are given permission to land at Kariba. But by the time they land, virtually out of fuel, Limbani has died of his wounds. Flynn passes out, wounded but still alive despite blood loss. Seeing that Limbani has died, Faulkner regards the whole mission a failure.Three months later, having managed to return to London, Faulkner breaks into Sir Edward's residence, holds him at gunpoint and takes half of the originally agreed payment from his safe. He then kills him. Faulkner and Flynn make a quick getaway.In the final scene, Faulkner fulfills his promise to Janders; he visits Emile at his boarding school. Faulkner offers to tell Emile about his father."

Aas <larsa@colargol.edb.tih.no> Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau is dead. At least that is what the world (and Charles Dreyfus) believe when a dead body is discovered in Clouseau's car after being shot off the road. Naturally, Jacques Clouseau knows differently, and taking advantage of not being alive, sets out to discover why an attempt was made on his life.

Clouseau after being mistaken for a lunatic and being sent to mental hospital, escapes and tries to find out who tried to kill him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Fifth of the Pink Panther series and the last to star Peter Sellers before his untimely death. French mobster, Phillip Douvier has got a problem - hardly none of the other crime families give his family any respect. To try and fix this problem, he gives orders to murder Chief Inspector Clouseau who everybody think is a genius and only a few like Chief Inspector Dreyfus know of his true stupidity. Thanks due to a mixup an escaping criminal dies in Clouseau's car, and it crashes and explodes. Chief Inspector Dreyfus is delighted (so much so that when at the memorial service he tries very hard not to laugh out in delight and everybody thinks he's crying), but Clouseau, wondering who's out to kill him gets the help of his oriental servant Cato and Douvier's secretary and ex-lover Simone Legree to help solve the mystery...—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> Philippe Douvier (Robert Webber), a major businessman and secretly the head of the French Connection, is suspected by his New York Mafia drug trading partners of weak leadership and improperly conducting his criminal affairs. To demonstrate otherwise, Douvier's aide Guy Algo (Tony Beckley) suggests a show of force with the murder of Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers).Unfortunately for Douvier, his first attempt at bombing him fails; and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist 'Mr. Chong' (an uncredited appearance by the founder of American Kenpo, Ed Parker) is thwarted when Clouseau successfully fights him off, believing him to be his (Clouseau's) valet Cato (Burt Kwouk) who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks. That night, Douvier poses as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap, but the Chief Inspector's car and clothes are stolen by transvestite criminal Claude Russo (Sue Lloyd), who is killed by Douvier's men. Subsequently Douvier and the French public believe Clouseau is dead and, as a result of this assumption, Clouseau's former boss, ex-Commissioner Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is restored to sanity and is to be released from the lunatic asylum to perform the investigation in Clouseau's death.In Russo's clothes and insisting on his true identity, Clouseau is taken to the asylum himself (featuring a cameo by Andrew Sachs, whose character apparently believes himself to be Hercule Poirot), but escapes into Dreyfus' room, who faints from the shock of seeing Clouseau alive. Clouseau manages to disguise himself as Dreyfus and is taken home by operative François (André Maranne). At home, Clouseau finds Cato, who, despite having turned Clouseau's apartment into a Chinese-themed brothel, is relieved to see he survived and the two plan revenge on the sponsor of Clouseau's assassination.Meanwhile, Dreyfus is assigned to read an elegy at Clouseau's funeral by the police chief's wife, on pain of his own discharge. During his recital, Dreyfus barely controls his mirth at the praise of Clouseau, but his reaction is disguised by his tears of muffled laughter. Later, at the graveside ceremony, Clouseau sneaks in disguised as a church official and then surreptitiously reveals himself to Dreyfus. Upon recognizing Clouseau, Dreyfus faints and falls into the burial pit.Douvier's wife eventually threatens him with divorce for his unfaithfulness with his secretary Simone. Needing her respectability, Douvier tells his secretary and paramour Simone LeGree (Dyan Cannon) that their relationship is over, to which Simone reacts angrily. Fearing that she will reveal his crimes, Douvier gives orders to have Simone killed at her nightclub; but having been told by an informant (Alfie Bass) of the possibility of trouble there, Clouseau and Cato inadvertently manage to save her.At Simone's flat, Clouseau reveals his identity, prompting her to reveal that Douvier ordered Clouseau's assassination. Attacked by more hit men, Clouseau and Simone escape into Dreyfus' flat, coincidentally located nearby. Dreyfus overhears Simone telling Clouseau of Douvier's plan to meet the New York Mafia godfather Julio Scallini (Paul Stewart) in Hong Kong, but again faints when he beholds Clouseau.Clouseau, Cato, and Simone follow Douvier to Hong Kong in disguise, unaware that Dreyfus has also arrived (Dreyfus wants to use the opportunity to finally get one up to Clouseau & redeem his own career). There, Clouseau impersonates Scallini, while Simone distracts the real Scallini; but the plan goes awry when one of Scallini's men spots Douvier leaving their hotel with a stranger and Clouseau exposes his own disguise.A car chase begins, ending in a crash at the Hong Kong docks, where Dreyfus recognizes Clouseau and pursues him into a firework warehouse. Inside, Dreyfus mistakenly sets the fireworks off and the resulting explosions sow chaos among all the participants, which eventually leads to the arrests of Douvier and Scallini.

Tony is kidnapped by the evil Dr. Gannon and his spinster partner Letha and implanted with a chip and mind-controlled into helping Gannon and Letha commit various crimes. It's up to Tia and a gang of truant kids to rescue Tony and prevent a major disaster.—Adam Chotiner <achot@mindspring.com> We open several years after the events of the previous film. A flying saucer leaves Witch Mountain headed for Los Angeles. It lands in the middle of Rose Bowl Stadium, and it's passengers disembark. Tony and Tia Malone, now teenagers, are being dropped off by their uncle Bene for a well-earned vacation in the city, having spent the previous years helping to develop their colony of extra-terrestrial survivors and learning to master their supernatural powers. They come to the locked front gate and Tony uses telekinesis to fly over it, but Uncle Bene has Tia simply unlock it instead. He tells the kids not to use their powers unless absolutely necessary to avoid unwanted attention, and tells them to focus on enjoying their vacation. They are picked up by an egocentric taxi driver named Eddie, who claims to have a perfect safety record despite his reckless driving. The children enjoy the drive through LA even so.
A black car pulls into a quiet back street, and three people get out. Eccentric scientist Doctor Victor Gannon, his benefactor Letha Wedge, and her nephew and henchman Sickle. Gannon is about to test his new experiment on Sickle; a mind control device. Gannon tells Sickle, who has a fear of heights, to climb one of the tall buildings to the roof, and when Sickle refuses, Gannon activates the mind control device. Speaking into a control box, he reiterates his command, and Sickle complies.
Tia and Tony notice the cab beginning to stutter. Eddie was so busy complaining about the other drivers on the road that he failed to notice the taxi running out of gas. They pull over and Eddie walks to a gas station to get a new can. When Eddie leaves, Tony and Tia have a premonition of someone falling. Tony tells Tia to wait by the cab for Eddie while he investigates to try and help. Tia agrees and tells him to be careful, and Tony goes to where he thinks the vision came from.
Gannon is thrilled at the success of his device, and tells Sickle to walk along the roof ledge, which he does. Letha is nervous Sickle will fall, and tries to take the control box from Gannon, who drops it in the struggle. The control box is damaged, and Gannon can no longer command Sickle, who is continuing to walk toward the end of the roof. Tony rounds the corner just as Sickle steps off the edge. Using his powers, he stops Sickle just before he hits the ground, and helps him to the sidewalk. Gannon and Letha are astonished, and Victor puts together very quickly that the boy is responsible for this miracle. He tells Letha he needs him for his experiments, and Letha distracts Tony while Gannon comes up behind him and jabs him with a tranquilizer needle, knocking him unconscious. Tia immediately feels that something is wrong, and runs to investigate. She gets there too late to see Gannon, Letha, and Sickle take off with Tony in their car. Eddie returns with the gas can, and upon finding the taxi unoccupied, leaves without the children. Unable to find Tony, Tia returns to where the taxi was, only to find it gone. Tia wanders the city looking for Tony, and stumbles into a group of boys running from a rival gang of much tougher kids. They tell her to run to and she follows them. Tia and the boys run into a closed off alleyway and hide, but their pursuers are closing in. Tia uses her telekinesis to fight the rival gang, giving her and the other boys time to get away. They thank her for her help and introduce themselves as the Earthquake Gang; Rocky, Muscles, Crusher, and Dazzler. They are would-be tough kids trying to establish themselves as a real gang, but it is clear to Tia that they are in over their heads. Despite this, they offer to help her find Tony. After spending all day searching, they come up empty.
Tia does not have a place to stay, since Uncle Bene had pre-arranged a hotel but gave Eddie the address, and Eddie drove away with all their luggage, so the Earthquakes offer to put her up in their hideout. On the way, they dodge a man in a minibus looking for the boys. The gang tells Tia the man is a truant officer named ""Yoyo"" Yokomoto. They successfully evade him and make it to the hideout. The hideout itself is the attic of an old abandoned house in a construction supply area. While the Earthquakes discuss what to do next, Tia suddenly gets a connection with Tony. Concentrating, she can only see a light shining down. After a few moments, the vision goes black.
Across the city at Letha's mansion, Tony, still knocked out, is strapped to a table in Gannon's laboratory in the cellar. Even unconscious, Tony is putting out too much energy to measure, shorting out Gannon's equipment. Gannon is repairing his mind control device and plans to use it on Tony, plotting to become the most influential man in the world with a super powered person at his bidding. Letha, however, is merely concerned with seeing a return on her investment, claiming that building Gannon's laboratory has left her bankrupt, and now nervous about the kidnapping. Gannon brushes her off, but she warns him that he'd better find a way to make her some capital with his invention. Tony begins to regain consciousness wake up, allowing for Tia's momentary contact with him, but Victor quickly injects him with more sedative and he passes out again.
The Earthquakes have to go home, revealing that they still have families and haven't worked up the nerve to run away and start their gang for real yet, but promise to return in the morning with breakfast. Tia thanks them for their kindness, which discourages them since they want to be bad boys.
The next day, Gannon has finished placing the tiny mind control device on Tony, hidden behind his ear. He activates it and it works perfectly. He wakes Tony up, and immediately Tia has another telepathic vision. She can temporarily see what Tony sees, which is just the laboratory machines and surgical instruments. Tia mistakes this for a hospital room, and she and the Earthquakes go to check the all the hospitals. Gannon asks Tony who he is and about his powers, and Tony has no choice but to tell him. Victor orders a demonstration of his powers, and Tony effortlessly unstraps himself from the table. Sickle is skeptical, so Gannon has Tony make an anesthesia canister chase him, and also has him stack multiple heavy wine casks to prove to Letha. She and Victor toast to the possibilities.
Tia and the boys have searched every hospital in town, and no sign of Tony. Tia tries to contact him, but his mind is blank. The boys promise to keep looking.
That night, Letha discusses the situation with Sickle. She imagines gambling in Las Vegas with Tony controlling the dice, but first she needs money to gamble with. Luckily, she sees an opportunity in the form of a huge stack of gold on display at a local museum. Sickle points out that Gannon won't allow Letha to use Tony to steal the gold, but she doesn't plan to ask permission.
Tia lays awake in bed at the hideout, trying to connect telepathically with Tony, who is asleep in Gannon's lab. The mind control device prevents Tia from getting through.
The next day, Gannon goes into town to run errands, and Letha takes the opportunity to use the control box and take Tony to the museum. They arrive with a large crowd at the exhibit, and as Tony looks around, Tia gets another scattered vision. She describes what she sees, and Dazzler recognizes it as the gold exhibit at the museum. They make their way there.
Letha orders Tony to cause a diversion at the exhibit, including making a stagecoach roll out of control, making the dummies move, and destroying the security system. Pandemonium breaks out, and the security guards are completely occupied trying to stop the chaos.
Victor returns from his errands to find Tony gone, and angerly goes to Letha's study, finding the newspaper article about the gold.
Letha tells Tony to break the glass case and send the gold bars to Sickle outside, and Tony complies. Sickle however is unprepared for how heavy the gold is, and gets out of the way as the bars start flying at him. Tia and the gang arrive and find Sickle hiding under his car from the gold bars pelting the trunk. They get inside just in time to see the last of the gold floating out, and take in the madness going on around them. As Letha moves to leave with Tony, Tia starts to reverse what he has done. Tony reveals it's not his doing. Tia spots Tony and gets his attention, and Tony tells Letha that Tia is his sister and is like him. Letha runs out with the boy in tow and meets Sickle, who's car is completely crushed by the gold bars, and Victor, who has arrived and is furious with Letha. Tia puts an end to the last of the chaos inside, and chases after her older brother. She and the Earthquakes see Tony getting into a car with his captors, and Tia uses her powers to stop the engine from turning on. Letha explains about Tia to Victor, who commands Tony to override her and make the car start. Tia is unable to stop them as they drive away. Just then, Yoyo arrives trying to catch the boys, but Tia convinces them not to run away. They all jump into the minibus and Tia tells Yoyo to chase after the car, saying her brother is also a truant. Yoyo excitedly agrees, and Tia takes control of the van.
An intense chase commences. Gannon orders Tony to stop the van, but for every obstacle he puts in their way, Tia uses her powers to get around them, including lifting a school bus and making the van fly over a train. The minibus takes a beating, but Tia keeps it going. Victor stops over a steep hill and has Tony magnify the sun's reflection, blinding their pursuers and causing them to crash. Victor and his group get away as Tia and the Earthquakes leave Yoyo to deal with a police officer.
Gannon is fuming at Letha over the museum incident, but tells her he has a plan that will get them both what they want; money and prestige. Letha tells him that they still need to deal with Tia, as she might find them again and ruin their plans. Victor asks Tony how Tia found them and he explains her telepathy. Victor decides to use this to his advantage to get rid of her permanently.
Tia is awoken from sleep by a telepathic message from Tony. He tells her he has lost his powers and needs help, and lures her to Letha's mansion. She breaks in and goes to the lab. She is surprised by Gannon's lab animal, a goat named Alfred, but keeps looking for Tony. She finds him tied to a chair and blindfolded, but as she approaches, Sickle jumps her and knocks her out with chloroform. Gannon puts her in a portable chamber with anesthetic gas, leaving her unconscious.
The Earthquakes get to the hideout to find Tia missing, and worry about where she might have gone.
Tia is able to barely wake up, but is immobilized by the gas. She empathically asks Alfred the goat to go get help, and sends him to find the Earthquake gang. Alfred breaks out of the house and makes his way across the city.
Gannon, Sickle, Letha, and Tony drive to a plutonium processing plant. Gannon plans to make Tony threaten to cause a nuclear meltdown unless a ransom is paid. They drive right in, Tony getting rid of the gate guard and security scanners.
Alfred comes across Eddie's Taxi, and butts another passenger out to steal his ride. Eddie tries to brag about getting a safety award from his cab company soon, and doesn't immediately notice the goat in his backseat. When he does however, it distracts him and he crashes the cab. Alfred jumps out and makes it to the hideout, frightening the boys. He grabs Tia's jacket to get the gang to chase him back to the mansion.
Gannon and company get into the furnace area of the plutonium plant, levitating a guard to get out of their way, and sealing the door behind them.
The Earthquakes follow Alfred to the laboratory and find Tia. They shut off the gas and help her recover, and she has a vision of the round top of the plutonium plant. Describing it, Crusher thinks he knows where Tony must be, and they all race to find it.
Gannon commands Tony to shut off the cooling system and the furnace begins to overheat. Alarms go off in the control center, but they are unable to restart the system. Gannon calls to deliver his ultimatum: he will allow the plant to explode and destroy everything in the area unless they are given five million dollars, safe escort to an airport, and worldwide recognition of Gannon's scientific genius. The plant officials call and evacuation and scramble to get the money.
Crusher leads Tia and the others to a mini golf course with a large golf ball on the sign, but obviously, this is not what Tia saw. They notice Yoyo mulling around his destroyed van, but he seems uninterested in catching them. Curious, they go and ask him why he isn't chasing them, and he reveals that report of the crash got back to the Board of Education, and they are coming down to fire him for destroying city property. He admits that he just wanted to help the kids get a good education so they wouldn't wind up on the streets, which makes the boys feel guilty. Over the radio, they hear about the crisis at the plutonium plant, and Tia recognizes the problems as being caused by Tony's abilities. She is able to power the van enough to get there, and Yoyo drives the group to the plant.
The plant director calls Gannon to offer him all the money they've gathered so far, saying the furnace will go critical soon. Letha wants to take the deal, but Gannon will not compromise.
The surface of the plutonium plant is in chaos when Tia and her group arrives. They go to the control center and Tia gets the director to explain where the overload is so she can fix it. She and to boys make it through the evacuating employees to the furnace level deep underground. Tia spots Tony from a catwalk and calls out to him, alerting Gannon, Letha, and Sickle to their presence. Tia tries to get through to her brother telepathically, willing him to remember her. Tony tries to fight against the control, but Gannon's device overpowers him. Gannon orders Letha and Sickle to catch the Earthquakes while he deals with Tia, who splits up with the gang to find the cooling system. Gannon commands Tony to eliminate Tia by crashing into her with a heavy console, but Tia spots it coming and cuts it off with one of her own, and is able to evade Gannon. Crusher and Rocky find her and show her to the Emergency Cooling System, and she sends them away while she begins to focus on turning the coolant back on. On a panel, Victor notices the furnace temperature cooling, and orders Tony to turn it off again. Tia and Tony struggle against eachother over control of the system, but Tia eventually wins out and the system is restored, much to the relief of the plant staff, who had just finished gathering the cash. Gannon takes Tony and sees Tia across the cavernous furnace room. He hides around the corner and orders Tony to kill his sister. He sends a metal rail flying at her, but she blocks it with a door. Tia tries to get through to him again as he sends a giant pylon, which she also blocks. Victor tells Tony to pretend to remember Tia and lure her under a several ton crane box. He complies, and Tia walks under the steel booth, which Tony drops on her. Tia tries to hold up the crane, but is in danger of being crushed. Gannon runs out and orders Tony to force the crane and kill her, but Tia notices the control box in his hand. Putting the pieces together, she destroys the box, releasing Tony from Gannon's control. She replaces the crane, and sends the box flying down the halls away from Victor, who chases it. Tony is dazed and confused, but Tia removes the device from behind his ear and helps him remember everything that has occurred since they were separated.
With the control box disintegrated, Gannon tries to convince Tony and Tia to work with him anyway. Tony responds by levitating him a hundred feet in the air and setting him down on a painting scaffold hung from the ceiling. Letha and Sickle arrive with the Earthquakes in tow, but Tony and Tia send them up to join Victor and leave them for the police.
Some time later, Yoyo and the Earthquakes drop the siblings off at Rose Bowl Stadium to wait for Uncle Bene. Tia explains that without them, the van won't run, so she and Tony meticulously restore the van with their powers. With the minibus as good as new, the Board of Education no longer has a reason to fire Yoyo, especially if the Rocky, Muscles, Crusher, and Dazzler go to school, which they agree to. Tony and Tia levitate themselves and the gang over the fence to the stadium, and they say goodbye to the boys. They meet Uncle Bene at the UFO, and when asked how their vacation went and why they are missing their luggage, Tony suggests they go surfing next time instead.
The Earthquakes climb back over the fence and go with Yoyo, and catch a glimpse of the flying saucer on it's way home."

Paradise Alley,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078056/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three Italian-American brothers, living in the slums of 1940's New York City, try to help each other with one's wrestling career using one brother's promotional skills and another brother's con-artist tactics to thwart a sleazy manager. It's 1946 in Hell's Kitchen in New York City. Cosmo Carboni, the eldest of the three Carboni brothers, is lamenting what he sees as them not living up to their potential. Big talking Cosmo hustles and panhandles for money. Brooding Lenny Carboni, an injured veteran whose sullen attitude stems from his time in the war, is an undertaker. And youngest Victor Carboni, the simple muscle-man who wouldn't hurt a fly unless he's annoyed, is an iceman. Victor looks to Lenny and his Chinese-American girlfriend Susan Chow as his voices of reason. After Victor holds his own against wrestler Frankie the Thumper in an arm wrestling match, Frankie who is seen as the strongest man in the neighborhood, and after seeing the lucrative wrestling matches - which are more like street fights without rules - at the underground nightclub called Paradise Alley, Cosmo gets it into his head that wrestling may be Victor's calling and a way for them all to get out of Hell's Kitchen for good. The brothers would act as trainer and manager. Lenny, doing it only to ensure Victor's safety, and Victor, who is rechristened ""Kid Salami"", ultimately agree. But instead of bonding the brothers closer together, the wrestling life and their relationship to a taxi dancer named Annie threatens to tear them apart as their priorities start to diverge. And a wrestling match with Frankie, who, with his sadistic manager, Stitch Malone, treats it as a grudge match, may threaten Victor's life altogether.—Huggo In 1946, in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City, after panhandling and pretending to be blind, Cosmo Carboni (Sylvester Stallone) is picked up in a truck by his younger brother, Victor (Lee Canalito), an ice deliveryman.

That night, when Sticky (Jeff Wald), the dance hall proprietor, chides her for being rude to a customer, Annie retorts that she is getting over a broken heart.Meanwhile, at a bar, Cosmo complains to his brothers that the Carbonis should be more successful.

Somehow, the team must sneak into the most heavily guarded base in German territory, steal the Nazi's most precious military hardware, and bring it back to the allies without getting arrested again by their own side.—The Inglorious Bastards Set in France 1944 during World War II, American soldiers Private Berle (Jackie Basehart), a deserter; Private Nick Colasanti (Michael Pergolani), a petty thief; Private Fred Canfield (Fred Williamson), a murderer who is nicknamed ""Assassin""; Tony (Peter Hooten), a mutineer; and Lieutenant Robert Yeager (Bo Svenson), who has been arrested for refusing to execute orders to kill, among others, women and children, are sentenced to death for their crimes and are shipped to a prisoners' camp near the Ardennes.During the journey to the camp, the convoy stops because of a flat tire, and Fred and Berle are ordered to change it.

Battlestar Galactica,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077215/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of Mankind, the last major fighter carrier leads a makeshift fugitive fleet on a desperate search for the legendary planet Earth. After 1,000 years of war, the humans from the Twelve Colonies are near to celebrate an armistice with the evil Cylon Empire. Out of the blue, the Cylons betray the pact and destroy the Colonies and their entire fleet, except the Battlestar Galactica. Commander Adama summons the few survivors from all the Colonies to follow him on a journey to find the mythical planet Earth. However, they are short of water, supplies and fuel and they head to the planet Carillon to replenish the fleet and get the supplies. Adama's son, the warrior Captain Apollo, and his partners Lieutenants Starbuck and Boomer destroy the mines left by the Cylons and they reach the planet. They are welcomed by the inhabitants and find the paradise. Meanwhile, the self-serving human leader Sire Uri wants to destroy their arms and live in the Cylon Empire despite the contempt of Adama. Sire Uri decides to give medals to Apollo, Starbuck and Boomer for their bravery on Carillon and invites the warriors to come to the party. However, Adama believes that it is a trap for the Galactica. What can he do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film takes place in a distant star system, in a distant future described as ""the seventh millennium of time"". For over a thousand years, humans from the Twelve Colonies (named Gemini, Caprica, Taurus, etc. as per astrological signs) have been fighting a war with the Cylons, a robotic race determined to exterminate humanity. The Cylons have unexpectedly sued for peace, through the diplomatic agency of a human, Count Baltar (John Colicos). The human leaders, called the Council of the Twelve (with one representative from each colony), and the commanders of their military fleet are all too pleased by the Cylon offer of peace, which ends so many years of warfare. The powerful battlestars are assembled for an armistice conference with humanity's age-old adversary. But it is a deception: the Cylons have no intention of making peace, and Baltar has betrayed humanity for the promise that his colony would be spared from extermination. (A promise that goes unfulfilled)Only Commander Adama (Lorne Greene), of the Battlestar Galactica, suspects that the Cylons are planning a trap, and orders a recon patrol, consisting of two of his best pilots: his eldest son, Captain Apollo (Richard Hatch) and Lieutenant Starbuck (Dirk Benedict). Adama's youngest son, Zac (Rick Springfield), convinces Starbuck to allow him to leave in his place. The patrol discovers a vast Cylon armada hidden behind a moon name Cimtar and ready to attack, but the Cylons jam their transmissions. Cylon raiders pursue the Colonial Vipers, and Zac's fighter is disabled. This forces Apollo to leave him behind, so that the Colonial fleet can be warned. Zac's fighter is destroyed by the Cylons just before he reaches the Colonial fleet.Baltar manipulates President Adar (Lew Ayres) into forbidding the launch of their fighters as the Cylons launch their pre-planned attack on the fleet. Frustrated, Adama orders the Galactica's Viper squadrons be placed on full alert, with their fighters ready to launch. As the Cylons attack, the Galactica is able to launch her fighters first, while the other battlestars are caught off-guard. With President Adar aboard, the Atlantia is destroyed, as are obviously the other battlestars; the Galactica alone survives the Cylon assault. Apollo informs Adama that the Cylons were accompanied by refueling tankers, and Adama realizes that this would allow the raiders to operate far from their basestars, which must be operating somewhere else. He orders the Galactica to withdraw and protect the planet Caprica (Adama's homeworld), but they are too late, as the Cylon armada has launched simultaneous massive assaults on the Colonies at the very same time the attack on the battlestars has commenced.With the Colonies destroyed, Adama collects as many survivors as possible, and orders every intact civilian ship to take whatever survivors they can carry and follow the Galactica. A ragtag fleet is soon formed, and they head away under the protection of the Galactica to seek their fortune among the stars on the legendary thirteenth human colony. It is called Earth, but the location of this lost colony is known only to the last lord of Kobal, the planet which was the original home of mankind, but which was abandoned thousands of years earlier, when the Thirteen Tribes migrated to the stars. After initially escaping the Cylons across a massive starfield called the Nova of Madigon (referred to as such on account of its extremely dangerous, hot environment, and Cylon minefield), the Galactica and the fugitive fleet find brief respite on the resort planet Carillon, where they hope to find food and fuel for their journey. As much of the fleet's food supplies were contaminated by pluton bombs during the Cylon attack, the fleet is in desperate straits, and must find a food source or face starvation.Determined that no human in any way shall survive, the Cylon Imperious Leader orders Baltar's execution after his services are done, but he is spared at the last minute in order to help the Cylons hunt down the human fleet. Meanwhile on Carillon, the local inhabitants (an insectoid race) agree to provide the fuel, and even offer to allow the humans to rest and recreate at a fancy casino/resort they maintain. This quickly becomes obvious that there is more to Carillon that meets the eye. The fact that Carillon has more than enough food and fuel for the fleet's needs makes Adama cautious. This is also obviously the largest tylium (fighter fuel) mining facility in that part of the galaxy, as well as a popular gambling resort, but nobody has ever heard of the place. Adama discovers that Baltar was responsible for performing the initial Carillon survey, reported that tylium was too minimal for mining, and he immediately smells a Cylon trap.But in the meantime, Sire-Uri (Ray Millland), Adama's self-serving nemesis on the new Council of the Twelve, uses the opportunity the planet presents for the morale of the fugitives to make his move against Adama, whose strict but selflessly benign intentions hinder his own ambitions. Guided by Uri to believe that the Cylons have been far abandoned, the Council of the Twelve propose that the humans pause to celebrate their escape and dismantle their military and weapons to prove to the Cylons that humans are no longer a threat to them. The Council arranges a banquet, and orders all fighter pilots to attend. Adams suspect that this might be a golden opportunity for the Cylons to launch an attack on their fleet, and orders Colonel Tigh (Terry Carter) to secretly hold back their fighter pilots from attending the party while he is to outfit noncombat personnel with fighter uniforms.Down on Carillon, Apollo and Starbuck gradually discover that something is amiss when they see strangers walking around clad in the uniforms of their squadron, and after some investigation they discover the truth behind the planet's prosperity. The natives of Carillon, the insectoid Ovions, have arranged the gambling resort to lure humans to them to serve as living food for their hatching larvae in their underground chambers. They are also secretly in league with the Cylons and mine the tylium solely for their purposes in exchange for their freedom, and they are cooperating the Cylons' attempts to eradicate the human fugitives. During a subsequent fight with Cylon centurions, the laser fire from both parties sets the tylium mines on fire, threatening to destroy the planet once the fire rages deadly out of control.Adama's clever ruse works, and believing that all fighter pilots are at the banquet, the Cylons launch a raider attack against the Galactica in orbit, but Adama is ready to spring his trap. Once the Cylon raider contingent is fully engaged with the Galactica, Adama recalls all his fighters from the surface of Carillon, taking the enemy by surprise. During the fight, Apollo realizes the Cylon raiders could not have come so far without a basestar, and he and Starbuck disengage from the battle and find a Cylon basestar hidden on the far side of Carillon. In defiance of Commander Adama's recall order, they decide to attempt to destroy her, in order to enable the fugitive fleet to elude pursuit, and use fake radio chatter to deceive the basestar into thinking it is under attack by multiple fighter squadrons. The basestar descends into Carillon's atmosphere to avoid detection, and is destroyed when the planet finally erupts into a massive tylium explosion. However, despite their victory, the humans realize their enemies will still be pursuing them, as they leave for Earth, their last hope for survival."

Lee Ermy), he is ordered to be cooperative because Loyce believes the young man's ""street smarts"" make him a natural leader. Loyce promises to bring Vinnie, Alvin, Dave and Billy back and transfer the racists out of the unit if Tyrone agrees to lead the company.In October, by the time training ends, Marine Company C has become a strong team and is assigned to Vietnam. Before they depart, Tyrone calls a drug dealer friend with a plan to smuggle back heroin. On their way to Vietnam, the soldiers meet their new commander, Captain Collins (Scott Hylands), who uses soccer to convey how the Viet Cong think.The company is under an enemy artillery attack as soon as their ship lands in Cam Ran Bay, South Vietnam and Collins volunteers the soldiers for a convoy to transport urgent materials to a field general. During the convoy, the company falls under an ambush attack by unseen Viet Cong and two men are killed and several more are wounded. When Dave is outraged to discover the ""urgent"" materials are cigarettes, liquor, food and other luxury goods, Collins insists he was not aware of their transport.The company makes it to the general's base and is rewarded with 24 hours R&R leave. As Vinnie and Alvin seek prostitutes, Billy is offered heroin by fellow soldiers and Tyrone talks to locals, hoping to find a drug dealing connection, but he is caught by the local military police and brought to Vietnamese Colonel Dong (Jose Mari Avellana), who accuses him of trafficking heroin. Dong is a drug trafficker himself and when he suggests that he and Tyrone become partners, Tyrone reveals his idea to smuggle the drugs in the body bags of dead soldiers.Later, Tyrone finds Billy overdosing on heroin and nurses him back to health, but he later berates his friend and fears he will put the company in danger. Meanwhile, Dave blows up the general's trailer of luxury goods as revenge. A little later, Vinnie discovers he has contracted a venereal disease from the local prostitutes and wonders why Alvin did not.When Company C is sent back into the combat area to replace another battalion, Captain Collins announces that the military's priority is obtaining a high body count of Viet Cong. In his effort to achieve the highest body count, Collins puts his troops in unnecessary danger, but is easy on Billy, because he is a great soccer player. Resentful, Tyrone disobeys Collins's orders during another Viet Cong attack but still manages to save the day. However, Collins punishes Tyrone by forcing him to lead his men into a dangerous rice paddy. There, Tyrone steps on a pressure release landmine and freezes in fear. Billy helps extricate Tyrone by replacing his weight with ammunition boxes. They both escape uninjured, but Tyrone is furious.One day, the company comes under another ambush attack by unseen Viet Cong on a river crossing bridge. When the enemy departs, the insane Collins orders an artillery attack on a village but Dave refuses to follow his order out of his worry of killing local civilians. Collins' more level-headed and sympathetic second in command, Lieutenant Archer (James Whitmore Jr.), sides with Dave and thinks it is unnecessary to launch any attack with poor knowledge of the area or about the enemy. Eager to increase his body count, Collin leads the attack himself; however, they discover only women and children in the village. Finding a young boy with a baseball, Billy starts an impromptu game.A little later, Colonel Trang (Vic Diaz) and Major Royal (Ken Metcalfe) interrogate the boy and promise Billy that they will not harm him, but after the company leaves the village, the men hear the boy screaming as he is shot to death. Furious, Billy announces he will never play soccer for Collins, provoking the Captain to punish Billy and Dave by reassigning them to patrol the mine-filled rice paddies.Later back at the fire base, Vinnie realizes Alvin never had sex with the prostitutes, and accuses his friend of being homosexual.Fed up with Collins, Tyrone reports a fake Viet Cong sighting and lures Collins out of his tent so he can kill the Captain under the pretense of ""friendly fire,"" but Archer stops Tyrone from shooting Collins and risk being court martialed and executed.Later, Colonel Trang finds Tyrone to discuss his drug smuggling proposition; however Tyrone is no longer interested and pretends Trang found the wrong man.Some time later in January 1968, Company C is sent to destroy an alleged Viet Cong technical operation center and Collins stays behind. During the attack, Alvin is injured by another unseen Viet Cong sniper and taken away by a medical helicopter, leaving Vinnie shaken. Archer soon realizes that Company C is being used as bait to draw out enemy fire, giving the artillery an excuse to counter attack and obtain a higher body count; he reports a false Viet Cong attack while he and the troops relax on the beach as they watch the bombing of an empty hill for several hours.When Tyrone complains about Collin's obsession with forming a soccer team, Archer explains that Collin's plan is to create a military team that will boost morale. If they can put together a winning team, they can leave combat. Tyrone tells Archer they need to get Billy back because he is their best player. Meanwhile, Billy and Dave have befriended local villagers. Billy agrees to play when he gets a letter from his girlfriend Betsy, who informs him she kept their baby, because now he has something to live for.At the climax, Collins organizes a soccer tournament with a local Vietnamese team. Dave brings some of the village children to watch. Company C names their team the ""Muthus."" Alvin, recovering from his injury, shows up to watch. When the Muthus gain the lead, Colonel Trang complains to General Sloan (Michael Cohen), claiming that it will hurt the country's morale if the Vietnamese lose. Sloan decides that it will be more politically advantageous to let the Vietnamese team win and orders the Muthus to throw the game. They follow orders at first, but Billy can't bear to lose. The Muthus win the game just as the Viet Cong attack. In the confusion of the battle, Collins is killed by enemy mortar fire, and Dave dies while avenging the death of the children he brought to the game by killing Colonal Trang, but gets killed himself by Trang's bodyguards.As the attack comes to an end, Alvin sacrifices himself by throwing himself on an enemy grenade to protect other children. Vinnie and the others are shell-shocked but do not have time to mourn. With Collins dead, Archer takes over command of the company and orders them to rally because they are being sent back to combat for disobeying orders. Before they leave, Tyrone arranges for Billy to be sent home, claiming Billy has a head injury. The film ends with Tyrone and Vinnie rounding up what is left of the company and they all march off the soccer field and back into the combat zone to their new fire base location... which happens to be Khe Sanh.In some versions, the ending closes with a series of texts which say that on January 30, 1968, Company C arrived at Khe Sanh just as the Tet Offensive began and the siege of the forward operating base was well underway.Out of 110 original members of Company C, 43 were killed in action during the three-month siege of Khe Sanh, including Tyrone Washington who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.51 others were wounded, including Vinnie Fazio who is permanently confided to the local V.A. hospital in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California.Lt. Archer and two other members of Company C were listed as missing in action.Billy Ray Pike, one of three deserters, left the U.S. Naval Hospital in Da Nang and made his way to Canada where he currently lives with his wife and son.On March 21, 1968, a replacement U.S. Marine company was air lifted from Camp Pendleton, California and relieved what was left of Company C which officially ceased to exist as an active unit in the U.S. Marine Corps."
The Manitou,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077904/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychic's girlfriend finds out that a lump on her back is a growing reincarnation of a 400-year-old demonic Native American spirit. Karen Tandy enters a San Franisco hospital suffering from a tumor growing in her neck. Her surprised doctors think it's a living creature, a fetus being born inside the tumor. Fortune-teller Harry Erskine dismisses it -- until one of his customers begins speaking in tongues and fatally throws herself down a flight of stairs, and Karen's surgeon attempts to cut off his own hand rather than excise her tumor. Erskine finally seeks help from another fortune teller, Amelia Crusoe, and her husband, to try to learn the cause of these supernatural events. When Karen's tumor gets larger, Dr. Snow speculates that within her tumor lives vengeful 400-year-old Indian spirit. Erskine travels to South Dakota to enlist the aid of Indian medicine man John Singing Rock to force the evil spirit out of Karen and back where it came. The Indian spirit is driven from Karen's tumor, but will it take over others before Singing Rock can send him back?—<Blythe379@cs.com> At a San Francisco, California, hospital, Dr. Bob McEvoy and tumor specialist Dr. Jack Hughes discuss an inexplicable, fast-growing swelling on the neck of McEvoy's patient, Karen Tandy. The doctors schedule surgery to remove it but agree to keep quiet about the lump until they can explain it, since the tumor seems to have the characteristics of a growing human fetus.Meanwhile, fake psychic Harry Erskine gets a call from Karen, his ex-girlfriend, who asks to see him. When they meet, Karen tells Harry about the upcoming surgery for the growth on her neck and confides her belief that it is not just a tumor. At Harry's home, he reads her tarot cards and the Death card keeps appearing. Harry and Karen make love and later, in the middle of the night, he hears her repeating a phrase in a foreign language in her sleep.The next morning, Harry asks Karen what she was saying but she does not know. Later, in the operating room, as Hughes prepares to make his first incision, Susan's eyes open and she chants in a foreign language. A supernatural force compels the surgeon to cut his own wrist rather than the growth on Susan's neck.Meanwhile, Harry ushers his next client, Mrs. Herz, into his apartment. The woman suddenly has a seizure and utters the same foreign words Karen said in her sleep. In a trance, she levitates out of the apartment and throws herself down the stairs.Later that day, Harry tells Hughes about his client's strange behavior. He is worried that Karen's life is in danger, but Hughes insists the mysterious words have no bearing on her medical condition. The surgeon admits he could not complete the surgery because Karen's vital signs plummeted. He then explains that the swelling on her neck resembles a human fetus more than a tumor. Harry suspects something is trying to control Susan and is transmitting signals that are causing her condition.Harry visits his mentor, Amelia Crusoe, at the occult shop she co-owns with her husband, ""Mac"" MacArthur. When Harry describes Karen's condition, Amelia suggests they hold a seance. At the conclusion of the ritual, during which a ghostly head appears on the table, Amelia suggests they are dealing with an evil spirit that had knowledge of black magic when it was alive. Based on the figure they saw, Harry surmises it is the spirit of a Native American medicine man.Back at the occult shop, Harry, Amelia and Mac conduct research and learn there is a belief among Indians that a powerful medicine man's immortal spirit, or Manitou, can be reborn by impregnating itself in a human host. When the three realize that Karen is about to give birth to such a being, they drive to Sausalito, California to consult an expert in Native American mythology, professor of anthropology Dr. Ernest Snow. Although Snow confirms the existence of reincarnated Manitou legends, he discounts the tales as folklore. Harry insists the myths must be real because Karen's life is in danger. When Harry asks the professor if he recognizes Karen's trance-like phrase, Snow identifies it as the language of a Northern California tribe that has been extinct for 400 years. Snow thinks the phrase means, ""my death foretells my return."" The professor suggests that Harry travel to an Indian reservation in South Dakota to recruit a medicine man.Harry takes this news to Hughes, who alerts Harry that Karen is undergoing surgery at that moment. Since the scalpel failed before, the surgical team is trying to excise the growth with an optical laser. Just then, Hughes gets an urgent phone call and rushes down to the operating room with Harry where they learn that the laser whipped around on its own as the technicians attempted to make the first incision. Hughes and Harry see the laser incinerating objects in the operating room. The laser stops when Harry shuts off the power. Harry and Hughes cautiously enter the room and approach Karen. Speaking for the spirit growing on her, Karen intones that they must not touch him; the light has hurt him and he will kill them all. She screams and writhes until the hospital staff sedates her. Hughes conjectures that the spirit of the medicine man is afraid of the laser and X-rays.Later, Harry drives to a South Dakota Indian reservation and locates a medicine man named John Singing Rock. John informs Harry that the Manitou in question is gaining the strength of a Christ-like spirit called Gitche Manitou, the most powerful figure in the Indian belief system. Humans cannot defeat the Manitou, they can only send it back to the place from which it came. To banish the spirit without killing Karen, they will need to invoke the power of other spirits, such as the mountains or the wind. John agrees to help Harry for a $100,000 donation to the Indian Educational Foundation.In Karen's hospital room, John draws a circle on the floor around Karen's bed and cautions Harry and Hughes not to break or smudge the circle, since it is the only barrier that might contain the Manitou. As John begins his ritual, Karen awakens and speaks in the spirit's voice, which calls itself Misquamacus and declares that it is stronger than John's magic. Misquamacus warns John that if he helps the white men he will die. John explains that Misquamacus, the strongest medicine man of all, wants revenge.That night, Harry and John observe Misquamacus emerge from Karen's back, then drop to the floor. The re-born Indian shaman has been hideously deformed by X-ray radiation it was exposed to as a growing fetus. As Misquamacus tries to break the circle, John calls on other spirits. Hughes wants to call the police, but John warns that Misquamacus can control the Manitous of man-made objects; if the police come, Misquamacus will turn the guns on the police just as the spirit turned the scalpel on Hughes. Later, Misquamacus breaks the circle and summons a lizard demon that bites Hughes on the hand. Harry takes Hughes to another floor for medical attention, then returns to Karen's room where he discovers that Misquamacus has disappeared with Karen.John suspects the Manitou is opening a portal for a greater demon to enter the human world. Misquamacus reappears and tries to kill Harry and John, but Harry throws a typewriter at the spirit. Misquamacus destroys it, but John and Harry escape. John has beseeched every Manitou for help but none have been able to stop Misquamacus. Harry tells John it is time to call on Gitche Manitou. Just then, an earthquake erupts. When it settles, John explains that Misquamacus has summoned the Great Old One, an evil spirit akin to Satan, to help defeat the humans. Looking at the computer equipment, Harry suggests that John direct the energy of the hospital's machines' Manitous at Misquamacus.As John and Harry return to Karen's room, John warns that the Great Old One is a master of illusion. Karen seems to float in outer space. John calls on the Manitous of the machines to send Misquamacus away and the building's machines whirr to life, but since they were created by white men, they don't respond to John. However, Harry's love for Karen causes the Manitous to focus their power through her. Karen rises from the bed and emits bolts of energy from her fingertips that blast through Misquamacus. In retaliation, the Great Old One sends fireballs toward the humans, but with the aid of the machines, Karen destroys the demon. Once the room returns to normal, Harry and Karen embrace. The next day, John reminds Harry that Misquamacus's body is dead, but the spirit lives on."

Liu Yu-te (Gordon Liu Chia-hui), one of Ho's pupils, having been inspired by his teacher's patriotism, is determined to join the anti-Ching ranks. Liu works as an espionage courier for his fellow-countrymen until the Manchu General in Canton, Tien Ta (Lo Lieh) orders his troops to round up all the anti-Ching patriots. The Manchu soldiers, acting on information, surround the Ho school and kill Ho and many of his students. Later, Liu's father is also murdered by the Ching lackeys; Liu escapes to the Shaolin Temple in hopes of learning martial art, with which skill he may avenge his father's death. The Abbot of the Shaolin Temple sympathises with Liu's plight, accepting him as an inmate and giving him the name ""San Te"". Liu does nothing but sweep the floors for nearly a year before being given permission to learn the Shaolin kung fu techniques, comprising 35 chambers. Of course, as a novice, he has to start from the lowest chamber. One of the 35 chambers concerns the study of Buddhism, and the others are devoted to the martial arts. Each pupil has to endure a stiff test in order to pass through any one chamber before going on to the next one. In an incredibly short time, Liu has mastered and passed 10 chambers, specializing in the employment of the fists, feet, palms, swords, sticks, lance, and other weapons. He continues to make tremendous progress in the art of kung fu, and with the approval of the Abbot, he leaves the temple and goes out into the country to not only attack the cruel Manchu henchmen, but also to recruit more patriotic youths for training in the temple. Meanwhile, the Ching authorities order Tien Ta and his troops to catch Liu and his fellow-monks. In a fierce encounter, Liu, aided by Hung Hsi-kuan, kills many enemies, including Tien Ta. Liu and his new fellow-fighters return then to the Shaolin Temple, where he immediately develops the ""36th Chamber"" which is the apex of the art of kung fu. The new blood, including Hung Hsi-kuan, Tung Chien-chin, Lu Ah-tsai and Chung Mi-lu, under the leadership of Liu, become a barb to torment the Ching flesh.—Celestial Pictures"

Mellon calls the police laboratory technician Mike London to arrange for the disc to be investigated. A green-skinned Billy opens fire on Mellon's car that evening, killing him in an explosion. The next day, Tony investigates the wreckage and recovers unusual material, which he brings to Mike London, who concludes it is an alien material that cannot be destroyed.The next day, Kathy puts the pendant on Billy's chest while they are laying together outside. Billy immediately wakes up with green skin and deformed teeth and attacks Kathy. Billy goes on a rampage, shooting random objects with the laser cannon. Law enforcement officials shoot at Billy from an aircraft, but Billy destroys the aircraft with the cannon, and later kills Chuck and Froggy by blowing up their car.While Tony questions Colonel Farley and Kathy about Billy, the two aliens land on Earth and begin searching for Billy. After killing a man and stealing his van, Billy travels into a city where he randomly fires at his surroundings.

California Suite,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077289/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Misadventures of four groups of guests at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Four totally different and separate stories of guests staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Diane Barrie (Dame Maggie Smith) and Sidney Cochran (Sir Michael Caine) come from England to attend the Oscars; Hannah Warren (Jane Fonda) comes from New York City, Bill Warren (Alan Alda) is her ex who lives in California; in the slapstick part, Dr. Willis Panama (Bill Cosby), Dr. Chauncey Gump (Richard Pryor), and their wives come to the hotel to relax and play tennis, only to find there is only one room vacant; in the fourth segment, Marvin Michaels (Walter Matthau) arrives a day before his wife for his nephew's Bar Mitzvah, while his brother Harry (Herb Edelman) sends a prostitute to his room.—Jonathan (jrd@netvision.net.il) Staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel, classically trained British actress Diana Barrie (Dame Maggie Smith) and her antiques dealer husband Sidney Cochran (Sir Michael Caine) are in town to attend the Oscar ceremony as Diana has been nominated for her first Best Actress Oscar for what she considers a comic trifle of a movie. Beyond Diana dealing with nerves in the lead up to the ceremony, Diana and Sidney confront the ""elephant in the room"" issue affecting their marriage, that elephant about which they rarely speak. A marriage long past is that of Bill Warren (Alan Alda) and Hannah Warren (Jane Fonda), who divorced nine years ago. New York City-based Hannah is staying at the hotel to meet with Los Angeles based screenwriter Bill, as their seventeen-year-old daughter Jenny (Dana Plato), of whom Hannah has primary custody, had earlier run off on her own volition to live with Bill until she comes of age next year and heads off to college. Their discussion about what to do about Jenny highlights the fundamental differences in temperament between the two, with uptight intellectual Hannah abhorring the vacuous California lifestyle, which is now epitomized by Bill. A marriage more on solid ground is that of Philadelphia-based Marvin Michaels (Walter Matthau) and Millie Michaels (Elaine May), who are in town to attend the bar mitzvah of their nephew, the son of Marvin's sex obsessed brother, Harry (Herb Edelman). Marvin has arrived at the hotel a day earlier than Millie. But their marriage may be in trouble if Millie, upon her arrival, discovers what Marvin is hiding in his bed. And a lost reservation and a full hotel the result of the Oscars is only the latest problem facing travelling companions, couples Dr. Chauncey Gump (Richard Pryor) and Lola Gump (Gloria Gifford), and Dr. Willis Panama (Bill Cosby) and Bettina Panama (Sheila Frazier). Chauncey and Willis are increasingly at odds with each other on this, their driving vacation, which is exacerbated by what is turning out to be Murphy's Law seemingly at every move that they make.—Huggo Four sets of people arrive in California and stay at the same hotel. One of these people is Hannah Warren (Jane Fonda) from New York City, who has come to take her daughter Jenny (Dana Plato), who ran away from her and would like to stay with her father Bill (Alan Alda). So Bill and Hannah spend the day bickering while trying to decide what's best for their daughter. Another one is British actress Diana Barrie (Dame Maggie Smith), who's nominated for an Academy Award and is attending the ceremony with her husband Sidney Cochran (Sir Michael Caine), who is not in the (entertainment) business. As well as two doctors, Willis Panama (Bill Cosby) and Chauncy Gump (Richard Pryor), and their wives. Chauncy has been complaining all of the way, and when they arrive, they learn that only the Panamas have a room, but the Gumps are forced to stay in a small single. Finally Marvin Michaels (Walter Matthau), who came to town for his nephew's bar mitzvah. Knowing that his wife is not with him, his brother Harry (Herb Edelman) takes him out for a little carousing, and when he returns, he finds a hooker waiting for him. The next day, his wife arrives.—rcs0411@yahoo.com On a flight to Los Angeles, California, British actress Diana Barrie (Maggie Smith) watches herself on the in-flight movie in the role for which she has received an Academy Award nomination. She expresses her nervousness about the upcoming Oscar ceremony to her husband, Sidney Cochran (Michael Caine), as the plane lands.Elsewhere, on a Los Angeles freeway, Dr. Willis Panama (Bill Cosby) and Dr. Chauncey Gump (Richard Pryor), physicians from Chicago, Illinois, vacationing together with their wives Bettina (Sheila Frazer) and Lola (Gloria Gifford), bicker with each other constantly as their rental car first breaks down, then collides with two other vehicles.As Diana and Sidney check into the Beverly Hills Hotel, Hannah Warren (Jane Fonda) paces her room in the hotel while waiting to meet with her ex-husband, Bill Warren (Alan Alda). When he arrives, they note that it has been nine years since they saw each other, then they leave to keep the lunch reservation he made.At the Los Angeles airport, Harry Michaels (Herbert Edelman) picks up his brother, Marvin Michaels (Walter Matthau), who has come to town to attend Harry's son's bar mitzvah. Marvin explains that he and his wife Millie (Elaine May) always fly separately, so she will arrive the next morning. Marvin notices that Harry still ogles and wants to proposition every beautiful woman he sees. Harry drops Marvin off at the Beverly Hills Hotel and they arrange to meet for dinner later.Meanwhile, Hannah and Bill reminisce over lunch and later at his beachfront home. She is an editor for Newsweek magazine in New York City and dating a writer for the Washington Post. He is a former journalist, now working as a screenwriter, and contemplating marrying his girlfriend. Then they discuss the real reason Hannah has flown to Los Angeles: their seventeen-year old daughter, Jenny (Dana Plato), unhappy living with her mother in New York, ran away to stay with her father and wants to spend the next year with him in Los Angeles. Hannah doesn't want her daughter living in southern California but she is nervous about seeing Jenny and getting her to return to New York.Back at the hotel, Diana continues fretting over the likelihood of winning the Academy Award and exchanges witty banter with Sidney. Later, she has a couple of drinks to calm her nerves as she gets dressed for the awards ceremony.As Hannah and Bill return to Hannah's hotel room, Jenny calls and informs her parents that she will abide by whatever decision they make. Hannah announces to Bill that Jenny will return to New York with her. Bill is disappointed but trusts Hannah's instincts. When Hannah expresses how afraid she is of losing Jenny, Bill remarks that he has never seen his ex-wife so vulnerable. Then Hannah says Jenny can stay with Bill in Los Angeles, but only for six months. Hannah watches Jenny drive off with Bill.At the hotel's front desk, the doctors learn there is a reservation for Willis but not for Chauncey. The hotel has no extra rooms because it is Academy Award week. The only thing available is a small single room undergoing repairs. Chauncey agrees to take it. Later, Willis tells Chauncey that he has made a dinner reservation at a Japanese restaurant and booked them a tennis court for a doubles game the next day. While the Gumps struggle to get ready in their tiny room, Chauncey complains about having to eat Japanese food. As Willis and Bettina wait for their friends in the lobby, Willis complains that Chauncey is always late. When the two couples finally gather at the hotel's front door, the doctors argue about who will drive to the restaurant, until Bettina insists she will drive.On the way to the Academy Awards, a nervous Diana begs Sidney to be nice to her and wish her luck. He reminds her how talented she is and gives her a kiss. They exit the limousine and greet the crowd outside the venue.Elsewhere, paramedics arrive at a collision in which a car is on top of the one Bettina is driving. While a policeman questions her, Chauncey insists to the officer that his legs are paralyzed from sitting down at the Japanese restaurant.After the Academy Awards ceremony, Diana observes Sidney speaking with an attractive young man. Drunk, she takes her disappointment about losing the Oscar out on her husband.At the hotel, as Harry drops his brother off after dinner, Harry teases Marvin that ""the night is not over yet."" Marvin goes to his room and finds that Harry has hired a hooker, Bunny, to entertain him.Later, Chauncey wakes up in the middle of the night, sick from the Japanese food. Lola calls Willis and insists he tend to Chauncey. Willis angrily acquiesces.Back in their hotel room, Diana jealously insists that Sidney was flirting with the young man that she saw him speaking with earlier. Sidney asks her why they cannot lie to each other about the nature of their relationship the same way they lie to everyone else about it. He reminds her that he has never hidden who he is... that he is homosexual. Diana asks why Sidney doesn't love her anymore. He insists he never stopped loving her. She says his kind of love doesn't do her any good, then begs him to ""screw"" her before immediately apologizing. She loves him but she doesn't understand why he stays with her when he could share the company of other gay men exclusively. He explains he enjoys his proximity to her minor celebrity and tells her he loves her more than any woman he's ever known. They acknowledge they have fun together, then share a kiss. She comes to bed and they make love.The next morning, Marvin wakes up to find himself in bed with Bunny. He tries to get her up and out of the room but she has passed out after drinking a bottle of tequila. Calling the front desk, Marvin learns that his wife, Millie, has just arrived and is on her way to his room. He tries to keep Millie from discovering the nude, unconscious hooker in his bed but finally reveals his indiscretion. Incensed, Millie leaves.Elsewhere at the hotel, Willis, Bettina, Chauncey and Lola play doubles tennis. Bettina accidentally smashes her racket on Willis' head, loses her balance and injures her ankle as she falls. Lola stumbles over a basket of tennis balls trying to come to Bettina's aid and Chauncey trips over the net trying to help Lola.Outside the Michaels' room, Millie hurries away as Marvin tries to explain his infidelity. At first, Millie doesn't see how she can attend the bar mitzvah knowing Harry paid for Marvin's hooker, then she decides to forgive Marvin and forget it ever happened. She also plans to spend all of his money.The Panamas and the Gumps return to the Panamas' room to care for Bettina's ankle. Lola breaks a bottle of perfume in the bathroom, then cuts her finger on one of the glass shards. While they tend to Lola, Bettina trips and falls through the room's French doors, breaking the panes of glass. Then Lola bangs her head on the door of the medicine cabinet while rinsing off her bleeding finger and passes out. Willis goes to the bathroom to soak a wet towel for her, but steps on the broken glass. Willis and Chauncey put both women on the bed then start fighting each other, damaging the room in the process.After shopping in the hotel boutique, Millie returns to the hotel room. Marvin tries to embrace her but she wants no signs of affection from him in front of the still-unconscious hooker on their bed.In the Panamas' room, Chauncey swears it has been the worst trip ever and Willis tries to force Chauncey to say it is the best time they ever had and that the Gumps will love going on vacation with the Panamas again.In front of the hotel, the taxi that the Michaels were going to take to the bar mitzvah has been given to Bunny, who is awake and fully dressed. She generously allows them to ride with her to their destination.At the airport, Hannah is surprised to see Jenny, who has come to say good-bye and thank her mother for letting her stay with Bill.In another part of the airport, the Panamas and the Gumps, who are bruised and covered in bandages, limp towards their flight.As Diana and Sidney's plane takes off, they learn that the in-flight movie is the same as on their flight to Los Angeles and Diana begs Sidney to get them off the plane."
Go Tell the Spartans,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077617/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the early 1960s, U.S. military advisers in South Vietnam discover the same challenges that plagued the French army in Indochina ten years prior. A unit of American military advisors in Vietnam prior to the major U.S. involvement find similarities between their helpless struggle against the Viet Cong and the doomed actions of a French unit at the same site a decade before in this bitter look at the beginnings of the Vietnam war.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> It's July 1964 in the period when American troops were euphemistically termed ""military advisers"" in Vietnam. Major Asa Barker (Burt Lancaster) has been given this command: a poorly-manned outpost named Muc Wa in rural South Vietnam somewhere near the rural Da Nang to Phnom Penh (Cambodia) highway that a decade earlier had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker is a weary infantry veteran in his third war (he served in the Pacific during World War II as well as in the Korean War), who provides veteran supervision to a cadre of advisers attached to a group of South Vietnamese who garrison the deserted village of Muc Wa.Barker, as a seasoned officer, knows that he cannot defend his position due to lack of numbers and the quality of his local troops. He is still obliged to carry out the orders of his superior, General Harnitz (Dolph Sweet), who sends Barker U.S. re-reinforcements to appease him. His command consists of a handful of U.S. soldiers (encompassing the inexperienced, unhappy, idealistic and glory-seeking) and some reluctant former Vietnamese paddy farmers turned militiamen. Barker is a capable commander who has ended his career by having an affair with a senior officer's wife. He argues that the hamlet is deserted and has no importance, but sends a detachment from his command. The detachment is commanded by the brash but nervous Lt. Raymond Hamilton (Joe Unger), and includes veteran Sergeant Oleonowski (Jonathan Goldsmith), who is suffering from battle fatigue, a drug-addicted medic named Cpl. Lincoln (Dennis Howard), and a young draftee named Cpl. Stephen Courcey (Craig Wasson), who quickly befriends an elderly native volunteer, nicknamed ""Old Man"" (James Hong). The American troops along with around 30 South Vietnamese troops and similar number of milita, set out from their base as Pangan to Mu Wa.On their way to Muc Wa along a dirt road, the column is ambushed at a roadblock, resulting in the sadistic ARVN Cpl. Nguyen ""Cowboy"" (Evan Kim) capturing and beheading the lone Viet Cong attacker. On reaching the hamlet, Hamilton sets up his defenses in a triangular formation and receives supplies brought in by helicopter. At the rear of the hamlet is a graveyard of 302 French soldiers with a placard above the entrance that reads, in French, ""Étrangers, dites aux Spartiates que nous demeurons ici par obéissance à leurs lois"" (Stranger, tell the Spartans that we remain here in obedience to their orders), which refers to the Battle of Thermopylae. While he is investigating it, Courcey spots a one-eyed VC soldier, who is presumably a scout. Back at Barker's base, he receives a Psy-ops officer who claims that he will be able to predict which one of Barker's outposts the VC will attack next.During a patrol, Courcey spots a group of nine Vietnamese women and children fishing along the small river that runs through the deserted Muc Wa village, despite intelligence that there are no civilians said to live in the area. Cowboy wants to kill the civilians for they might be Viet Cong sympathizers, but Courcey stops him and lets the civilians take shelter in their base camp. Courcey befriends one of the civilians, a teenage girl, whom takes a liking to him despite the language barrier.That evening, the VC attack Muc Wa by a harassing attack where the doped up Lincoln is wounded. Coursey leads an ambush patrol that kills the four-man Viet Cong mortar crew.The next morning, Barker travels to Saigon to meet with Colonel Minh (Clyde Kusatsu), the military chief of the region where he tries to persuade him to send reinforcements of at least 300 ARVN troops to Muc Wa. But the corrupt Minh refuses for he claims that he needs the troops to stay in Saigon to prevent a potential coup that may happen.The following night Muc Wa is again attacked by the VC, sustaining its first casualties when Lt. Hamilton is killed when he tries to rescue a wounded militaman, along with a few South Vietnamese soldiers.The next day, Sergeant Oleonowski commits suicide rather than face the pressure of command. When Barker is informed of the deaths, he wants to pull his troops out now that they lack an experienced leader, but this request is refused by Harnitz, forcing Barker to send his own deputy, Captain Olivetti (Marc Singer) to Muc Wa. When the psy-ops man predicts Muc Wa will be attacked, Barker contacts them by radio only to learn that they're under attack from the Viet Cong.True to Barker's predictions, the outpost is attacked again that night by the massive numbers of Viet Cong who number in the many thousands, not the few hundred predicted by the high command, and they are all well armed with various automatic weapons, not outdated rifles. Barker is forced to threaten Harnitz over the radio to send air support for Muc Wa in which several helicopters and flare ships arrive just in time to stop the Viet Cong attack.The next day, Barker receives orders by Harnitz to withdraw all of the American troops from Muc Wa which is believed to be under siege by the 507th Viet Cong battalion, a force numbering at most 1,000 men. Barker personally flies out to Muc Wa by helicopter to evacuate the surviving Americans as well as the wounded, but leaving behind the South Vietnamese troops, including the walking wounded. The idealistic Courcey refuses to leave the wounded, so Barker stays behind with him to help evacuate the remaining South Vietnamese troops and militiamen overland to safety. This leaves Barker, Courcey, Cowboy, the Old Man and his fellow South Vietnamese militiamen at Muc Wa.That evening, the Vietnamese civilians that Courcey found and brought into the base camp steal several weapons and try to escape, forcing Cowboy to kill all of them. But the Vietnamese teenage girl gets away and informs the Viet Cong scouts of the American's plans to withdraw... thus revealing that she and all of the other civilians were in fact Viet Cong supporters (as Cowboy predicted) after all.Barker and Courcey are forced to blow up all of the arms and equipment left behind and then leads the group on the road away as friendly artillery fire begins raining down on the area. But no sooner has the group filed out, they are ambushed on the road by the Viet Cong, led by the civilian girl. In the ensuing battle everyone is killed, including Barker who tries to help Courcey when he is wounded. Barker then collapses and apparently dies from a heart attack, while the Old Man drags Courcey to hide him in the nearby bushes as the enemy Viet Cong attack from all directions.The only survivor of the battle is ironically the willing volunteer, Courcey, whose idealism and enthusiasm for the Vietnam War has now been killed along with all his comrades. He wakes up after the battle in the morning to find that everyone else is dead and the soldiers, including Barker, are stripped of their fatigues. The VC have withdrawn having left him for dead. As Courcey wanders to the grave site, he finds another survivor: the wounded, one-eyed VC scout that he saw earlier. The VC points his rifle at Courcey before dropping it out of exhaustion. Courcey says to the one-eyed VC, ""I'm going home, Charlie, if they'll let me"" as he wanders off the grave site and onto the dirt road leading away from the ruins of the village."

After getting a new haircut to boost her confidence, Susan attempts to follow up with a photo editor for a possible job, but is unsuccessful. At the elevator, she runs into her friend Julie (Gina Rogak), a fellow photographer, who mentions that she has too much work and encourages Susan to be more assertive about networking. Julie also shares that she split up with her partner and is enjoying living alone. Before going their separate ways, she tells Susan that she will be in touch if she needs an assistant.Taking Julie's advice, Susan shows her portfolio to the magazine editor who recently bought three of her photographs, but he is not interested in her latest project. While playing chess with Rabbi Gold, Susan complains that her photographs have been rejected by at least 50 people recently, despite the fact that many of them think she has a ""good eye."" Rabbi Gold advises her to quit feeling sorry for herself.Lonely and bored one evening, Susan tries inviting a friend to a movie. She then calls and leaves a humorous message for someone else. When the electricity suddenly goes out because she is too broke to pay the utility bill, she screams in frustration.Anne suggests to Martin that they invite Susan to the country house for the weekend. Martin agrees, but thinks that Susan does not like him. During the weekend, Martin cooks for the three of them, but as soon as they sit down, he begins sneezing. Playfully, Susan takes a photograph of him. In response, Martin canoodles with Anne, joking that she is a helpless, blond woman. Anne becomes annoyed and leaves the room. When Martin follows her, Susan is left alone at the table. Later that day, Anne seeks Susan's opinion about whether she should go back to school, but Susan appears apathetic. When Anne wonders how it is to live alone, Susan matter-of-factly replies that she likes it.After photographing a wedding, Susan chats with Rabbi Gold in his office. She speaks to him about her grandparents who were orthodox Jews; as a little girl, she was envious when they spoke to God, and the experience made her want to be a rabbi. He then confesses that he wanted to be an actor growing up. Later that evening, she and Rabbi Gold kiss each other goodnight, and agree to a lunch date.While hanging out with Susan, Anne notices her good mood and asks about the new romantic interest. Being slightly secretive, Susan describes him as attractive and fiftyish, but feels that it is too early to worry about the fact that he is married. Then, Anne reveals that she is pregnant. Susan wonders how she will manage a baby and school. After Anne leaves, Susan describes her as impetuous to another friend.When Susan arrives for their lunch date, Rabbi Gold regrets that he must cancel because of a last-minute appointment with his wife and son. As soon as she arrives home, Susan begins decorating, a process that she has neglected since moving into the apartment. She manages to show her portfolio to Mr. Carpel, the purveyor of a distinguished art gallery. Carpel says her work is not the right fit for his business, but he recognizes her talent, and refers her to Beatrice, an emerging gallery owner. That evening, Eric comes to Susan's for dinner.On another day, Susan informs Julie that she can no longer work as an assistant due to her upcoming gallery show. Julie congratulates Susan, but admits that she is jealous. During a meeting with Beatrice, Susan says she is not particular about the arrangement of the images at the gallery. Beatrice suggests that she stop by on Monday, just in case she wants to make any changes before the opening.One evening, Anne and Martin wait for Eric and Susan to arrive for dinner. Irritable from the pressures of her first child, writing and marriage, Anne yells at Susan for being late, and they begin to quarrel about who has more free time. Susan admits that she felt ""betrayed"" after Anne got married, and Anne calls her ""selfish."" On another evening at Eric's apartment, he questions why Susan will not move in with him to save money, and Susan says that she prefers having her own place. With the upcoming gallery opening, she is anxious about the reaction to her work. Additionally, it bothers her that Eric continues to display the paintings of his ex-girlfriend in his apartment. While making dinner, their bickering continues and Susan walks out.Later that evening, Julie is staying over and tries to console her. Disheartened, Susan feels that she has ruined her relationship with Eric and her friendship with Anne. Susan realizes that she forgot to stop by the gallery to approve the display and rushes out. While she is out, Anne telephones to wish Susan good luck for the show and apologize for their fight. As the gallery opening begins, Susan complains that Beatrice left out an important photograph. Beatrice replies that it is unprofessional for her to raise the issue now, when was she given the opportunity earlier. Many family and friends are present, but Martin informs Susan that Anne is unable to attend. He appears somewhat confused by his wife's behavior, but relays a message from Anne that she is at the country house and thought Susan might understand.After the show, Susan drives to the house to surprise Anne. Feeling like a coward, Anne reveals that she was pregnant with her second child and had an abortion that morning, but is afraid to tell Martin. Susan tries to reassure her about the decision. While preparing tequila shots, Susan admits to insecurities in her relationship with Eric. During the evening, the two friends rediscover their connection."

Five Deadly Venoms,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077559/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The sixth and final pupil of a dying martial arts teacher is instructed to find the teacher's five former pupils and defeat any evil ones that are among them. A dying martial arts teacher instructs his sixth and final pupil to check on the activities of his five former pupils, each of whom he had taught a unique and lethal style of kung fu: the Centipede, the Snake, the Scorpion, the Lizard and the Toad (hence the film's title). This pupil, who knows a little of each one of the five styles, must team up with one of the other good pupils to destroy the evil ones, if there are any at all. Greed and treachery ensue as the pupil soon discovers that some of the pupils are indeed evil, but which one can he trust enough to team up with, if any?—Ken McCary <kmccary@amaroq.ces.ncsu.edu> A martial arts pupil is instructed by his dying teacher to track down the teacher's five former pupils. Each one of them is a master of a unique and lethal style of kung fu and the teacher fears that they might have used their skills for evil purposes. To make things more difficult for the pupil, not only does the teacher not know the identities of the five former pupils (who all wore masks while they were being trained by him), but some of them also do not even know each other.—Joseph B. McGlinchey <jbm29@columbia.edu> Chang Cheh's super-heroic and Grand Guignol-flavored martial arts thriller proved hugely popular in the U.S., inspiring a U.S. soft drink commercial and even an entire rap music act's world tour. It also spawned a film series featuring more amazing, high-flying, blade-juggling and flesh-stabbing mayhem.—Celestial Pictures The film begins with a martial arts pupil named Yang Tieh caring for his elderly teacher. The teacher is very ill and the treatments that Yang is giving to him are no longer effective. The teacher knows that his time is up and he is dying. He tells Yang that there is no longer any time to put off what he needs his pupil to do and what he has been preparing him for. He has been instructing Yang in the ""Poison Clan"" kung fu techniques, but now he is dying. He tells Yang that he has had other pupils besides Yang and is deeply concerned about what they are now doing. Poison Clan kung fu can be used to harm and oppress people for evil purposes. Many of the Clan's members have already done this, thus earning the Clan its bad reputation. The teacher tells Yang that he must tell him more about his previous pupils.Yang and the teacher descend into a dungeon-like area underneath the main room. Various training tools and structures, all of them now old and dilapidated, sit here, each with a large emblem of a different poisonous or venomous animal on the wall nearby. The teacher says that he had five previous pupils. Number 1 studied the Centipede style, which is known for exceptional speed (he is shown rapidly smashing small plates dropping from the ceiling, most of them before they even hit the floor). Number 2 studied the Snake style, which is known also for speed and for agility (he is shown smashing ceramic pots and moving limbo-style under a rack, smashing rungs out from underneath it). Number 3 studied the Scorpion style, which is known for the stylist's hands moving like scorpion pincers and for powerful kicking techniques (he is shown practicing these kicks and then smashing wooden targets on tall poles). Number 4 studied the Lizard style, which is known also for agility and for nimbleness, enabling the stylist to climb surfaces like a lizard (he is shown running up the walls of the room and snuffing out candles). Number 5 studied the Toad style, which is known for power and resilience and is near-invincible against physical harm (he is shown lying on a bed of spikes, pushing wooden spikes with his bare chest and using forearm smashes to bend sheets of solid metal).The teacher explains that the pupils always wore masks while they were being trained in their styles and they changed their names after they finished their training. Moreover, they did not all train together at once - Numbers 1 and 2 trained at the same time and they knew each other. Number 3 trained alone afterward and never met any of the other four. Numbers 4 and 5 also trained at the same time, but only after Number 3's training was completed. These two pupils, just like Numbers 1 and 2, also knew each other, but neither of them ever met any of the first three. Number 4, the Lizard, was the oldest of the pupils. All five of them will only use their skills in times of absolute and dire emergencies, making it even harder to find and identify them.Yang has studied the basics of all five styles but has not specialized in any of them and thus his skills are not enough to defeat the five pupils on his own. The teacher tells him that he must only be an ally with at least one pupil who is not using his skills for evil purposes. Only then can he hope to defeat any of the others who are, if any. He makes Yang promise to locate the five pupils and make sure that they are not using their skills for evil. Any who are doing so must be faced and dealt with accordingly.The teacher has one lead for Yang to follow. He once had a colleague who used to be a fellow Poison Clan teacher and is now living quietly in a nearby small town under a different name. He also has a lot of money he made from the Poison Clan's activities. The teacher wants Yang to find this colleague and convince him to donate the money to a charity of his choice. The five pupils also know about this money and may try to get it for themselves. The colleague, although skilled in kung fu, would not be a match for them now.Yang makes his way to the town, keeping both his eyes and his ears open. He sees that a police officer, He Yuan-Xin (his last name is dubbed as Ho in the English-language DVD), is very well-liked among the townspeople. He watches Officer Ho on patrol with his captain, Ma Chow, who seems to be polite and reasonably friendly but more businesslike than Ho.(this space is going to be filled in at a later date)Captain Ma is heading home in the evening when he passes by the workplace of an elderly scribe named Mr. Yuen. Yuen is clearly a well-liked and respected man throughout much of the town. Ma checks in on him and makes sure he is all right. Yuen is working a bit late that night, but plans to go home soon.Upon arriving home, Yuen finds that his entire family is being held hostage by two mysterious men who turn out to be the Snake and the Centipede. They are certain that Yuen is the former Poison Clan teacher who has the money. The Snake and the Centipede become a bit too overzealous in their interrogation of Yuen and they beat him to death. Frustrated by finding out nothing about the money or its location and thoroughly intending to leave no witnesses behind, they slaughter Yuen's entire family, including the women and children, and leave the house empty-handed. As they are leaving, a gambler and the town drunk named Won Fa spots the Snake and the Centipede. He barely manages to hide before they see him, paralyzed with fear.Some time later, the Scorpion stealthily arrives at the Yuen family's house. We do not see the Scorpion's face, as he is wearing his training mask. He looks over the family members' corpses and notices that Yuen's corpse is holding a single candle in his hands. Taking the candle out of Yuen's hand, he breaks it in half and finds a small piece of parchment inside of it which he secretes into his clothing before leaving.When the corpses are discovered, the police begin an investigation. The local judge is under pressure to have the case closed and solved quickly due to Yuen's highly respected position in the town. He puts the police under a strict deadline, after which they will all be beaten for each additional day that it takes to solve the case. Ho has a couple of ideas and asks for some leave for official purposes.Officer Ho discusses the case with his friend. They believe that one of the Clan members may be responsible. Ho is now certain that Yuen was the former Clan teacher who had the money and he was killed for it. Suddenly, Ho hears a slight noise outside the room where he and his friend are talking. He opens a casement, causing Yang to stumble into the room. Yang reveals that he has learned that Won Fa saw the Yuen family's killer.Won Fa is brought into the police station. A kettle of hot tea is poured over his face in order to make him talk. But then Officer Ho offers him a piece of silver in return for what he saw at the Yuen family's house. Instantly much more talkative, Won Fa says he saw a heavily bearded man come out of Yuen's house. Ho and several of the police know the man as a good friend of Qi Dong (his name is dubbed as Mr. Hung in the English-language DVD), a wealthy aristocrat who is well-connected with local government officials.Ho is speaking again with his friend who says that he has also seen the bearded man. They are wondering if he is the Centipede, the Snake or the Scorpion. Ho tells his friend that he needs to assist the police with the man's capture. When Ho speaks to the police about the plan, Ma is skeptical. Ho assures his fellow officers that his friend is a first class kung fu expert.Ho goes to visit Hung the next day, dropping a subtle hint suggesting that Hung is somehow involved with the Poison Clan. Hung's face clearly changes expression, but he pretends not to understand anything.Meanwhile, Ma and the police are waiting for Hung's bearded friend, Zhang Yiao-Tian (his name is dubbed as just Tian in the English-language DVD). Yang is hiding nearby and watching all of this. The police surround Tian but cannot capture him. Finally, Officer Ho's friend steps out of a door and identifies himself as Liang Shen (his name is dubbed as Li Ho in the English-language DVD) and accuses Tian of the Yuen family's murder. Tian leaps at Li, swinging a sword that he had seized from one of the police officers. Li does not budge and the sword bounces off his naked arm, revealing him to be Clan member Number 5, the Toad. Tian must use his kung fu skills to fight Li, thus revealing that he is Clan member Number 1, the Centipede to both Li and the police. The Centipede and the Toad fight in a well-choreographed kung fu scene. The Toad defeats the Centipede, grappling him so the police can place him in chains and shackles. Ma asks Li to come to court, but Li says it is not necessary.Yang walks off having learned that the Toad and the Centipede are in the town, but he does not yet know anything about any of the other three.(this space is going to be filled in at a later date)Li is placed in the Iron Maiden. Just as it is closed, he regains consciousness and bursts out of the device, his body unmarked and unharmed. He chastises the police for their device, understanding what it is made for, and saying that he does not have a weak spot. The police cannot contain Li. Then Hung emerges from behind a curtain and engages Li in battle, thus revealing that he is Clan member Number 2, the Snake. Li notes the snake design on Hung's wrist bracelets and understands who he is and that he is behind the plot to frame him for the murders. The Snake and the Toad fight in another kung fu scene. The Snake uses his style to probe the Toad's body, trying to find the weak spot. The Toad is starting to get the better of the fight when suddenly two metal darts hit him from behind, sticking in him behind his ears. The darts are shaped like scorpions. The Toad understands that the Scorpion is somewhere in the courtroom, but he cannot determine where. The Snake begins to laugh and hits the Toad hard in the same spots, behind his ears. Li's Toad style is broken and he is now helpless. The police put him in the Iron Maiden again and the judge demands that he confess to the murders. Li simply faints and is rendered unconscious. When he is removed from the Iron Maiden, his body is covered with puncture wounds.(this space is going to be filled in at a later date)Officer Ho returns to town. Ma finds him at police headquarters, brooding and angry. He has learned that Tian was acquitted of the Yuen family's murder and Li was convicted. He interrogates Ma about the turn of events and Ma merely says that the case is now closed and Li's crimes have been confirmed. Ho wants to see Li, but Ma says that Li killed himself.Ho storms off to the tavern, angry, and orders all the patrons to leave. He begins to drink heavily when some of his fellow officers approach him, showing him some money they were given by Hung. They explain that Li was suffocated by an officer named Ling Xuong after his kung fu was broken by a device called the Iron Maiden (Ho's face changes to show that he has heard of the device and understands why it was used). They also reveal how Won Fa and Officer Ling were killed as witnesses and collateral damage - Won Fa was killed with a hook that was shoved down his throat and Officer Ling was killed with a long and sharp needle that punctured his brain. Ho gives them back the bribe money so they can escape town quietly in the evening.He begins to drink again when he spots Yang watching him. Yang simply smiles and reveals to Officer Ho that he is Clan member Number 4, the Lizard. He gives Officer Ho a Poison Clan password to prove that he is also one of the Clan. They go off to find privacy in order to talk.Yang explains how he figured out that Officer Ho was the Lizard. He also reveals that, while drinking and gambling with various officers in the police force, he learned that the Toad's style was not broken by the Iron Maiden, but by the Scorpion. They both know that Yuen was the former Poison Clan teacher and was murdered for the money that he had. It was not removed from his home, so Yuen must have had a map showing the place where the money is hidden.Officer Ho brings Yang to a secret area in town where he trains and keeps his Lizard style technique sharp. Having training in all five styles of the Poison Clan, Yang shares his knowledge of the Centipede's, the Snake's and the Scorpion's styles, devising strategies for himself and Officer Ho to fight against them. They practice and hone these strategies well into the night. Since he is teaming up with the Lizard, Yang's battle strategy will involve using his own Lizard skills.The next day they head to Hung's mansion to confront and kill both him and Tian. They find Captain Ma waiting for them on the way. Ma wants to help out. He understands what they want to do and believes that Hung and Tian will be tough to beat. Because of his friendship with Ma, Officer Ho agrees. As they start out again, Officer Ho notes that Ma is not wearing his police uniform. Ma states that he has resigned from the force. Officer Ho decides that he will quit as well, pulling off his uniform's hat and shirt and dropping them in the street.As they arrive, Hung looks closely at Ma and states ""I wasn't expecting three."" Officer Ho calls Tian out and says that he knows that Tian is the Centipede and Hung is the Snake. The Lizard and Yang begin a huge kung fu fight with the Centipede and the Snake; the fight raging throughout the mansion and revealing Officer Ho's identity as the Lizard to Hung, Tian and Ma (at one point, Ma looks intently at Ho for a moment). During the fight, Tian is hurt and the Lizard and Yang are able to team up against the Snake. Frustrated and clearly on the losing end of the fight, Hung demands to know why Ma is just standing by and watching, saying that he knows who Ma is.Understanding that his cover is now blown and the jig is up, Ma suddenly lunges into the fight with a kung fu kick that reveals himself to be Clan member Number 3, the Scorpion. In the sudden confusion, Hung turns and tries to run away, but Ma opens two hidden compartments on his belt where he stores his scorpion-shaped darts and hurls a handful of them into Hung's back. He demands to know how long Hung has known about him. Hung answers that he spotted Ma throwing the darts that broke the Toad's kung fu in the court fight. In response, Ma throws another handful of darts that strike Hung in the chest and stomach. Officer Ho is stunned, admitting that he was completely fooled. He understands that Ma, as the Scorpion, was seeking the money for himself and planning to kill all of his fellow Clan members so that they could not go after him and get it for themselves. His demeanor completely changed in an instant, Ma admits to doing all of this and that he has Yuen's money.Yang and the Lizard then engage the Scorpion in battle. Holding them off but knowing he cannot take them both by himself, the Scorpion calls to a now-recovered Centipede to help him. When an appeal to logic (that Yang was sent by their teacher to hunt them all down and he will kill them both if he is given the chance) fails, the Scorpion bribes him with an offer of letting him have half the money for his help. That gets the Centipede's attention and he rejoins the fight. Splitting up the Scorpion and the Centipede, the Llzard and Yang each fight both of them to the best of their abilities.Meanwhile, the Snake pulls the scorpion-shaped darts out of his chest and stomach and then pulls himself to his feet, coming up behind the Scorpion, who is starting to get the better of his fight against Yang. The Snake strikes from behind, bursting open the Scorpion's stomach and abdomen. The Scorpion instantly kills the Snake with a high kick over his shoulder that smashes into the Snake's forehead. But the damage to the Scorpion is done. The Lizard and Yang climb a wall, fighting the Scorpion and allowing him to overexert himself to the point that he dies of his wounds and blood loss.The Centipede tries to find a clue to the money's location on the Scorpion's corpse, but the Lizard and Yang are waiting for him. Putting their strategies against the Centipede style to good use, they kill Tian.With the fight now over, the Lizard pats down the Scorpion's corpse down and finds the map, which reveals the location where Yuen had hidden the money. A disgusted Yang says that they should kill the corrupt judge as well, but the Lizard says that if they do this, the next judge could be worse than he was and the killing must stop sometime. The best course of action now is to use the map to find the money and then use it as their teacher would have wanted them to do, to try to make up for every one of the Clan's crimes. The film ends with the Lizard and Yang leaving the mansion and the corpses of the Centipede, the Snake and the Scorpion inside it in order to carry out their teacher's final wishes."

An Enemy of the People,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075993/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A scientist stands against an entire town when he discovers their medicinal spa is polluted. It's winter in a small southern Norwegian town in the late nineteenth century. After years of struggling, Dr. Thomas Stockmann and his family - his wife Catherine, their young adult daughter Petra, and their two adolescent sons Ejlif and Morten - have returned to town after being away for five years up north, he now well respected and successful as the medical resident of the Health Institute at Kirsten Springs, where he is also a board member. He devised the springs and institute as a center of therapeutic benefits on his own, but developed it with his brother, the town mayor, Peter Stockmann, who is the board chair. They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more.—Huggo Based on a play by Henrik Ibsen. A small forest town is trying to promote itself as a place for tourists to come enjoy the theraputic hot springs and unspoiled nature. Dr. Stockmann, however, makes the inconvenient discovery that the nature around the village is not so unspoiled. In fact, the runoff from the local tanning mill has contaminated the water to a dangerous degree. The town fathers argue that cleaning up the mess would be far too expensive and the publicity would destroy the town's reputation, so therefore news of the pollution should be suppressed. Dr. Stockmann decides to fight to get the word out to the people, but receives as very mixed reaction.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> A small-town doctor discovers that, for economical reasons, his colleagues propose to conceal that the local health spa is contaminated by tannery water.—Scott Lane <rslane@ix.netcom.com> In a small Norwegian town, Catherine Stockmann, the wife of Dr. Thomas ""Tom"" Stockmann, prepares to entertain prominent members of the community, including the People's Daily Messenger newspaper editors, Hovstad and Billing. Tom returns home with his two young sons, Morten and Ejlif, as well as his friend, Captain Forster, who is included among the dinner guests. Before the event begins, Tom's brother, Peter Stockmann, arrives for a routine medical examination. As the town's judge and mayor, Peter also serves as chairman of Kirsten Springs, the community's new tourist destination and the foundation of its economy. Tom, who is the Springs' medical examiner, has recently conducted a study of the water and is awaiting its results; Peter is pleased to learn that Hovstad and Billing will publish Tom's findings before the summer season to promote tourism. Hovstad credits Tom with originating the plan to capitalize on the town's natural resources, but Peter claims that he alone had the wherewithal to establish the business and leaves the house in anger.As guests sit down to dinner, the Stockmann's eldest child, Petra, runs to the table with mail for her father. After reviewing the letter's report in his office, Tom returns to his family and friends with terrible news: Kirsten Springs is polluted with bacteria from a nearby tannery owned by his eccentric father-in-law, Morten Kiil. Before construction began, Tom warned that it was unsafe to build a pipeline so close to a mill that dumps waste into a nearby river, but Peter prioritized cost reduction and expediency. Although the town's water is now contaminated, Tom is convinced that conditions can change for the better with a new waterworks system. Placing the report and his article in an envelope, Tom has his maid, Randine, deliver the findings to Peter. Meanwhile, Hovstad and Billing insist on including the story in the following day's newspaper, even though the official report is in Peter's possession.Later that evening, Tom receives a reply from Peter, but tucks the report away before Catherine can see it. In the morning, her father, Morten Kiil, visits the Stockmann home, skeptical about Tom's findings. Later that day at a tavern, Tom meets Hovstad, who intends to portray the story as a scandal involving the town's corrupt bureaucrats. Just then, the People's Daily Messenger publisher, Mr. Aslaksen, joins the table and promises to galvanize the community with a public demonstration, but Hovstad suspects Peter Stockmann will try to cover up his brother's findings and turn the town against him. Upholding Peter's integrity, Tom gives Hovstad the report in good faith, promising that it is fit for print once he has discussed the data with his brother.Back at the Stockmann home, Peter antagonizes Tom and declares that the decontamination plan will cost 300,000 kroner. Peter appeals for Tom's ""discretion"" in revealing his findings, but Tom warns that the danger to human life could reach epic proportions if the truth is suppressed. He also reveals that Hovstad and Billing are preparing to print the report. Threatening Tom's career and family, Peter orders his brother to publicly denounce the article and endorse the Kirsten Springs board. Tom later visits the People's Daily Messenger and consents to the publication of his report. When he leaves, publisher Aslaksen suggests a moderate approach toward the article, since it could create a backlash against the newspaper.Shortly thereafter, Peter arrives at the office, claiming he will tax poor and middle-class townspeople to pay for the new waterworks, even though Kirsten Springs is a privately owned corporation. Peter claims that his brother fabricated the report to defy authority, and Aslaksen fears the town's economy will collapse under the new taxation. As Peter procures an alternate ""report,"" the publisher agrees to cover up Tom's findings to save the town from financial ruin. Just then, Tom returns to the office and Peter hides to conceal his arrangement with the newspaper.When Tom sees his brother's walking stick, he realizes his allies have been swayed. He retrieves his report and insists on leading a town meeting the next day. By the time of the gathering, however, the townspeople have already been biased in favor of Peter's false report. The mayor declares that his brother is a threat to democracy, and promises that the springs will bring prosperity to rich and poor members of the community. When Peter argues that his brother should not have the right to read his report, Aslaksen calls for a vote. Realizing the town has turned against him, Tom declines to present his data. Instead, he warns that democracy is not foolproof, since the decisions of the majority can ultimately be wrong. As the crowd responds with rage, Aslaksen reads a motion to proclaim Tom an ""Enemy of the People."" With the exception of Captain Forster, all citizens agree to deny the doctor's civil rights.Upon returning home in a snowstorm, the Stockmanns are greeted with stones thrown through their windows and an eviction notice. Tom plans to move his family to the U.S. on Forster's ship, but Catherine does not want to leave. Meanwhile, Petra is dismissed from school for being a ""radical."" Just then, Peter arrives with news that Tom has lost his job, but he can re-establish his career by retracting the report. Tom also learns that his father-in-law, Morten Kiil, has spent the day amassing Kirsten Springs stock for half its original value. Noting that Morten is capitalizing on the repercussions of Tom's report, Peter threatens to punish his brother as a conspirator, but Tom refuses to give in.Sometime later, Morten visits his son-in-law with a fist full of Kirsten Springs bonds. Reminding Tom that the Kiil family has owned the polluting tannery for generations, Morten declares that he used Catherine's inheritance to purchase Kirsten Springs shares. In Morten's blackmail scheme, Tom must accept the bonds to retain his family's wealth. In doing so, however, he will own an enormous stake in Kirsten Springs, and is therefore obligated to recant his report to protect his investment.As Morten leaves, Hovstad and Aslaksen arrive to suggest a new approach to the crisis. Since Morten bought the Kirsten Springs bonds in the Stockmann family name, the People's Daily Messenger can publish articles that convey Tom as a hero, showing townspeople that he purchased the stock to implement his changes. In return, Hovstad requests payment from Tom to cover the newspaper's financial loses. Realizing that the only way to clear his name is to become corrupt, Tom declares that the community is as poisoned as its water. After chasing Hovstad and Aslaksen from his home, Tom announces that the family will stay put and fight for the truth. While the Stockmanns cover their broken windows, a barrage of rocks are hurled through the windows of Tom's office."

Spawn of the Slithis,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078277/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A nuclear leak creates a mutant Slithis sea monster, which terrorizes the variety of pets, winos, and hippies who hang around Venice, California. A nuclear leak creates a mutant Slithis sea monster, which terrorizes the variety of pets, winos, and hippies who hang around Venice, California.—Jeremy Lunt <durlinlunt@acadia.net> Wayne Connors (Alan Blanchard), a high school journalism teacher in Venice Beach, California, reads a disturbing newspaper story about two mutilated dogs found near the city's canals. The article reminds him of a canine carcass he recently saw on a jetty. An evening or two later, an unseen monsterous being emerges from a canal and breaks into the house of Jack and Helen Dunn and brutally murders both of them.The following week, Wayne hears a radio report about a Venice couple who were brutally murdered at their canal-front home, in a manner similar to the mangled animals. Driven by journalistic curiosity, Wayne visits the abandoned Dunn residence and walks inside the unlocked house. Amid broken furniture and bloodstains, he finds an unusual mud-like substance. When a police officer arrives, Wayne is ordered to leave immediately, but manages to collect a sample of the sludge for his scientist friend, Dr. John (J.C. Claire). Upon initial examination, Dr. John is intrigued, describing the material as ""a fossil that is still alive.""A few days later, Dr. John reports his findings to Wayne, but first provides some background information: Twenty years ago, a nuclear reactor leak in Wisconsin contaminated an adjacent lagoon. After the silt in the water became radioactive, it absorbed bacteria, algae, and other primitive life and evolved into a new organic form. Scientists coined the mutated, radioactive mud, ""slithis,"" but the discovery was concealed to avoid alarming the public about the nuclear leak. Dr. John reveals that the substance from the Dunn residence is similar to slithis. One of the scientists who initially researched the slithis, Dr. Erin Burick, continued to experiment with radiation to create new life forms and now lives in Malibu, California. Bored by teaching, Wayne is eager to pursue the story as a means to jump-start his career. Meanwhile, his wife, Jeff (Judy Motulsky), has reservations, considering the potential hazards of radiation and nuclear waste.The next morning, a flight attendant is found murdered in her apartment across the street from a canal, and the media reports the incident as a sacrificial mutilation, related to the previous killings. While investigating the crime scene, Wayne learns that a vagabond named Bunky was in the vicinity that night and locates the man at a boarding house. Bunky appears unsettled and is initially reluctant to talk, fearful that he might be questioned by police about the murder. He finally admits to Wayne that, although he was intoxicated, he is convinced he saw a slimy lizard-like monster emerge from the canal.Later, Wayne meets Dr. Erin Burick (Dennis Lee Falt) in Malibu and explains that he confirmed the presence of slithis in the Venice area, but needs more evidence. Burick reveals that slithis cannot be replicated in a laboratory, so the radioactive material must have leaked from the Imperial Energy Plant, a nuclear facility on the coast about a mile from Venice. He adds that the material has possibly mutated from a simple life form into a more complex creature. Wayne speculates further that the creature needs human and animal nutrients to keep it alive. Based on his studies, Burick states that slithis can incorporate the characteristics of anything it absorbs, so the growth potential could be endless. To find the source of the radiation leak, Burick advises Wayne to analyze the soil surrounding the nuclear facility.Next, Wayne hires Chris Alexander (Mello Alexandria), a SCUBA diver, who owns a fishing boat, to collect water and soil samples offshore from the plant. During the dive, Chris notices that the fish population, which is normally abundant around the warm waters of the plant, has dwindled. An evaluation of the samples reveals no radiation, but there are hints of slithis, indicating that there was a radioactive leak at some time.Meanwhile, Wayne recounts his finding to a lieutenant at the Venice Police Department, but the officer suspects the killings are associated with a cult and ridicules the idea of a creature formed by radioactive waste. Undeterred, Wayne devises his own method for monitoring the slithis during its nightly feeding routine. Reasoning that the creature travels to the canals from the ocean harbor, Wayne and Dr. John block access by closing the canal gates overnight.That evening, the creature (Win Condict) is forced to remain in the harbor, but massacres a young couple at the marina. After another gruesome murder, the lieutenant (Hy Pyke) appears more willing to consider Wayne's explanation. However, the Imperial Energy Plant denies any radioactive leaks to the police, and the officer once again dismisses Wayne as deranged.Dr. John, Chris, Jeff, and Wayne develop a plan to capture the slithis in the harbor. While Chris and Wayne track the creature from the boat using sonar, Dr. John and Jeff stand by on land to shut the canal gates. Wayne hopes to corner the beast in the harbor and catch it with fishing nets. In the middle of the night, the group is almost asleep when the slithis is detected approaching the canal entrance. Wayne radios Dr. John to quickly lock the gates. Hungry, the monster targets the scientist and Jeff as his next victims, but they narrowly evade the threat, and the slithis returns to harbor waters.On the boat, Chris loads his rifle and instructs Wayne to throw bait overboard to attract the slimy beast. When the boat motor overheats, Chris and Wayne relocate to the engine room for repairs. Meanwhile, the slithis crawls on board and kills the two hired crewmen, Mike and Nicholas. As Wayne emerges from the engine room, he finally sees the slithis up close. He and Chris use several weapons to fend off the assault, until they finally overpower the creature by lodging an anchor into its neck. As the slithis lies motionless on the deck, Wayne and Chris are exhausted and consider whether to take the creature to shore or dump it in the sea. Chris insists on immediately dispensing with the toxic garbage. After pushing it overboard, however, the slithis inexplicably returns to life and attacks the Wayne and Chris, apparently killing both of them."
Circle of Iron,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078975/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young martial artist embarks on an adventure, encountering other martial artists in battle until one day he meets an aging blind man who will show him the true meaning of martial arts and life. A young martial artist, Cord the Seeker, competes for and loses the right to go on a quest for the Book of All Knowlege held by a wizard named Zetan, but he goes along the path to seek Zetan anyway. Along the way, he meets strange tests and challenges by enemies and allies - often having difficulty determining which is which.—Sam L. <saml75@yahoo.com> This movie, chiefly written by Bruce Lee, is about obtaining Enlightenment, so this synopsis also contains some Buddhist interpretation of ""Circle of Iron."" Many things happen in a very subtle manner, so I explain their significance, even though the movie does not.This movie is about finding the Buddha, within your own mind (and heart, and soul). And so, after Enlightenment, you become the manifestation of Buddha. Then, you can truly say, I AM the Buddha. (Of course, some lucky Christians also achieve Enlightenment. Then they can say, I AM the Christ, although a manifestation of Jesus as a human being, not as being God Himself.)Teachings (and Rules) are important for the Way toward spirituality, but they cease to teach you when you are Enlightened (or, on that last path to receive Enlightenment). At this point, every person decides what they will do to live their own spiritual life, and what they believe about the Supreme Being.Cord sets off to find ""The Book."" It is guarded by Zetan: ""the Keeper of The Book."" The Book contains the secrets of the Universe (and it really does), and gives you the information needed to become Enlightened.Along the way, there is a flute playing a haunting song (and his Spiritual Guide who plays that flute). Whenever Cord hears the music play, he is about to face a step on his journey (or, one of his 3 Trials).Cord tried to become the Seeker to Zetan by entering the Contest, offered at a local monastery. Many martial arts masters are there to vie in ritual combat to be awarded the Medallion. This is the prize. This Medallion proclaims its wearer as that monastery's Seeker (to face and defeat Zetan, so he is allowed to read The Book). Everyone sent in the past has failed to defeat Zetan.The movie opens toward the end of the Contest. We watch Cord quickly win 2 rounds of the Contest. The final round arrives; it is Cord versus Morthon. During their combat, Cord hit Morthon while he was down on the ground. So, Cord is disqualified, and Morthon wins the Contest. The medallion necklace is put around Morthon's neck.Cord objects to be required to obey every Rule . But the official proclaims that rules are Rules, and perfectly following them is an important trait of anyone in order to defeat Zetan. The next morning, Morthon sets off to find Zetan. Cord follows him for a day, but then runs off when he hears the inviting flute music, until he gets to where the sound is coming from. He witnesses a fight. A man with a flute fights, and quickly defeats, many angry men who attack him.Morthon left, so Cord leaves alone, on his journey. Along the way, Cord has 3 Trials. For the first 2 Trials he is forewarned about the situation.. . . . . . . The Monkey Trial: Don't turn your back on the attacker, even if he is just a Joker.Cord hears the music again. So he follows the music again, and meets the man playing it. Later this man will become Cord's Spiritual Guide. This Guide has a scene with a Monkey. The Monkey screams loudly, and keeps trying to get behind him. He constantly turns to face the Monkey. After the Monkey leaves, Cord asks if this is the secret of how to handle Monkeys. ... Yes, it is.Cord walks on alone and finds Morthon, bleeding and unable to walk. Cord asks: ""Did Zetan do this to you?"" ... Morthon moans: No, ""I failed the First Trial."" ... Cord asks, ""What was that First Trial?"" ... ... ""Monkeys."" As he dies, Morthon tells Cord to take the Medallion. Cord puts it on. Now, Cord is the ""legal"" Seeker for the monastery.Cord enters the nearby cave, full of monkeys. There he witnesses another Seeker with a Medallion (from a different monastery), fighting with the Chief Monkey. It rages on for minutes. (During this fight Cord hears his Spiritual Guide repeat the lesson: ""Unmask his ego"" and you will win against a Monkey.) The fight finishes. The Seeker is killed, and his medallion is yanked off from his neck (and added to a pile of medallions, from all of the other dead Seekers).Cord walks up. The Monkey says many things to belittle Cord, and make jokes of Cord's every answer, and keeps circling around him. Cord stays focused, and doesn't allow himself to forget why he is there -- to defeat the Monkey (and win his First Trial). Finally, Cord says: ""I don't want to fight you""; so ""let me just walk around you."" The Chief Monkey replies: ""That is not in the order of things"" (you must fight me, in order to go to Zetan). The fight is ON. Cord hits and hits, the Monkey gets blocked at every blow. The Monkey stops. Then he tells Cord how to find Zetan: ""Go to a wilderness, and find a rose there."" ... Cord has survived his First Trial.Cord gets his next clue of the upcoming Trial. Cord meets a man standing in a barrel of oil. This man has been inside of the barrel for 10 years. He is trying to melt off his penis. His legs are like spaghetti, and his penis is just a wisp. He is doing this because he can't prevent himself from having affairs (after making 100 Vows of Celibacy over the years, and lacking the courage to cut his penis off). His wife (after earlier not liking the idea) supports him living in the barrel, and even brings him food to eat. When Cord tells him he's looking for Zetan, the man warns him that sex will get in the way, and that Cord will falter in his search because of his sex drive. Then he invites Cord to get in the barrel with him (because -- he thinks -- Cord will fail, just like the man did, and then Cord will want to melt his off ). Cord laughs, and walks off. Cord has taken a Vow of Chastity a year before, and he ""knows"" that he will remain faithful to his Vow until he attains Enlightenment. The man in the oil was weak about sex, but Cord is NOT weak.. . . . . . . .The Sex Trial (in 2 parts). . . . Part one. Cord arrives at an encampment, in celebration, with dancing and fireworks. He sees a veiled woman go by, with a rose on her robe (Find a rose in the wilderness). This is the Way to Zetan! He follows the woman into a tent. Changshaw invites Cord to sit next to him. He offers Cord whatever he needs for his journey. Cord says he wants to ""Find a rose in the wilderness."" She is Changshaw's 9th wife, ""You may have her."" Cord tells him about his Vow of Chastity. Changshaw laughs. ""My wife would break her promise of fidelity to me, and you would break your promise to yourself.""A man with another Medallion wants to fight Changshaw; Changshaw tries to talk the man out of it. The man insists. OK. The fight is on. Changshaw kicks him in the groin over and over. He dies with a crushing blow. (His medallion is yanked off and thrown into a box of medallions.) Changshaw announces that by dying, the man has finally found what he was looking for, knowledge and truth. Cord watches. That night, Cord decides to sleep with wife number 9. He has realized that sex is a beautiful thing. He falls in love, and asks her to come live with him. She agrees, but tells him to get some sleep for their journey. The next morning, Cord finds out that she is dead, and Changshaw has killed her (and left the area). Cord is filled with anger at Changshaw. Eventually, Cord discovers why the other man wanted to fight Changshaw -- in revenge for killing his lover, Changshaw's 8th wife.Cord meets with his Spiritual Guide: Cord tells him his understanding of the lesson: ""Don't hold on too tight"" to anyone else. Cord is told: ""You can't even possess yourself, how can you possibly hope to possess someone else?""... Good lesson. Our minds wonder from second to second, so we cannot possess our own mind completely ... therefore, how can we control the mind of another person? ... Well, we can't. ... This lesson (later) gravitates inside of Cord to become: 'Don't hold too tightly to your feelings of revenge on Changshaw.' ... Don't let your journey for Enlightenment come to an end, just because of this betrayal by Changshaw.. . . . . . . Time for the Third Trial. It is a dark night. Cord goes to sleep. A scary noise awakens him. A growling panther arrives. Cord is afraid. Then Cord realizes what is happening: the panther is Death (incarnate). Cord was at first afraid, but then finds his center and says: ""Come any time, welcome guest."" ... Cord has passed the Third Trial. He faced Death itself, and didn't want to hold on to his Life. By offering his Life, he has saved his Life. Now, onward, to find Zetan.Cord asks his Spiritual guide to be his Teacher. He will only be teacher if Cord asks him no questions about anything Cord sees him doing. ""Agreed."" Then, Cord sees 3 separate incidents where he couldn't understand his Teacher's actions, 2 apparently angry and destructive to someone, and 1 other which seemed irrational. Cord fires his Teacher, and asks him ""Why?"" . . . and finds out how blind he was; the Teacher explained each situation to him, and Cord saw that his actions each time were absolutely what should have occurred. The former Teacher leaves. Now Cord is on his own for the rest of the way.The Sex Trial. Part 2, Cord arrives. Changshaw greets him, and then he kills a bull with a karate chop (maybe, to let Cord know this Trial could kill him, like the man before). Changshaw brags about killing his 9th wife with his own 2 hands, because Cord had slept with her. But Cord replies, ""I killed her, with THESE 2 hands"" (by his very act of sex, and asking her to leave her husband). Changshaw lets him know he has passed this Trial: (You are) ""Not the same Cord"" (I knew before).Now a final battle, to learn the secret of all the Trials. Cord blocks all of the blows. Then Changshaw suddenly becomes the Monkey he had fought before, Cord loses his center and gets hit. Then Death appears, growling, Cord gets hit. He hears the music, smiles a knowing smile (all 3 of the creatures in my Trials are the same man), Cord relaxes and finds his focus. He lands all of his blows, and gets none back. Changshaw pulls back from him. ... It's over. . . . Changshaw smiles, Cord smiles, and laughs. ... Cord hears the magic words: ""You are the Chosen"" (the one to meet Zetan). Zetan is on that island. A boat arrives and transports Cord across the water. Cord is ceremonially cleansed, and given a new robe to wear (the same one that everyone else is wearing there). Cord is now ready to face Zetan.Comment: Cord has faced the Monkey trial, in which he has resisted becoming shamed (and from losing his focus on the task at hand). Cord faced Changshaw, with love, instead of with hate and vengeance (after Cord's beloved girlfriend was killed because of his affair with her). Then, Cord invited Death to come and kill him whenever he wants to. Cord has conquered his fear of Death, his fear of obsession with sex (and revenge), and his fear of being shamed. These are 3 Trials which face all men, all of our lives. How we react to these Trials controls our actions (and our feelings, and our view of Life). While passing through Cord's 3 Trials he has transcended those blocks to living freely, and so, he is one of the lucky people who can now read from The Book, and find personal Enlightenment.Cord is led to a group of people. Cord asks to see Zetan. The group opens up, and there stands an old man, with a large image of 3 Roses on his robe (like the Monkey said: ""Find a rose there"" ... the 3 Trials). Then Zetan offers Cord a rose he picks off of a bush. Cord refuses. All he wants to do is to read The Book. Zetan walks him across the monastery. There are many people in the courtyard. They haven't read The Book, ""They are called the Near Ones. They are studying the perfecting of perfection"" (instead of finishing their journey, and reading The Book, after passing their own 3 Trials). Zetan has Cord sit, and drink tea. Cord asks, ""When do we fight?"" Zetan says, ""About what?"" ... ""The Book.""Zetan mocks all of those Seekers who come to read The Book. He invites Cord to just live there, in the monastery's perfect harmony. But Cord will not be deterred from his mission to become Enlightened. Cord again asks to see The Book. Zetan escorts him away, saying, they are on their way to perform the ceremony of ""Your becoming the Keeper of The Book."" ... What??? ... but Cord walks on.Zetan asks Cord to sit on the Seat of Knowledge (which fills Cord with the peaceful atmosphere of the monastery). Then, Zetan tries to convince Cord to take over Zetan's job, of being the Keeper of The Book. Cord refuses, and asks for The Book. It is brought to him, and is lovingly held by one of the Near Ones. Cord opens The Book. Page one appears, Cord is surprised and confused. ... Page 2 is confusing. Page 3, a knowing smile appears. Page 4, the power of Enlightenment hits. Cord closes The Book.All 4 ""pages"" are mirrors. All that Cord could see in each page was his own face. Cord now knows the secret to Enlightenment: It is all within Cord himself -- look within yourself, deeply into your soul (where all your pure thoughts and desires live), and that continuing to hold onto that deep look will bring forth Enlightened thoughts, one after another.Cord asks what happens to people who have read The Book. Zetan says that some of them become teachers, and provide the 3 Trials that Seekers must overcome. Cord says, ""And one of them plays a flute that only I can hear""
(his Guide). Cord laughs with his realization. Zetan again asks Cord to become the Keeper of The Book. Cord laughs. Zetan begs him to become the Keeper. Cord laughs more.Comment: All these many years, Zetan himself has been afraid to look into The Book. Good grief, for all these years, Zetan has failed to complete his journey. Zetan stopped just inches from success ... and instead, Zetan has to witness Seeker after Seeker who WILL look into The Book. Then, add to this, that he can't find anyone to take over his job commitment as the Keeper of The Book. But, Zetan is just another person who has turned away from his Goal, and who has lived to regret it. What they say (in almost any religion) is, don't start on a deep spiritual path half-heartedly, because stopping that journey before you finish it, may later leave you worse off than if you hadn't started it at all.Cord follows the music to his Spiritual Guide, who looks at him and says: ""You've looked at The Book, Cord."" ... ""Yes."" ... ""And what did you see?"" ... ""Everything."" ... Wow! Cord is in the club of Enlightened beings. They excitedly hug each other. Then, he hands his flute over to Cord, and Cord begins to play music (a different song), while his Guide dances. The journey ends. The new journey begins. The credits roll.Afterthoughts. Cord did not play by the Rules (of the Contest at the monastery). This very act of not blindly following Rules is the need of a Seeker, in order to find personal Enlightenment. These rule-followers are the many Seekers who die along the Way, or just get distracted from their Goal. So, it is important to follow the Rules most of your life. But, when the time comes to seek Enlightenment, rules just get in the way of progress toward your Goal. Enlightenment requires a different view of Life and events. Keep focused on the Goal, but be open to making all of the changes (in attitude and perspective) that you need to continue to go along your journey in order to achieve that Goal."

Avalanche,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077189/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The vacationers at a winter wonderland struggle to survive after an avalanche of snow crashes into their ski resort. Their holiday then turns into a game of survival. Caroline Brace (Mia Farrow) checks into the newly opened ski resort owned by her ex-husband, David Shelby (Rock Hudson). Delighted to run into her former mother-in-law, Florence Shelby (Jeanette Nolan), Caroline joins her on a tour of the facility with Florence and David's accountant, Henry McDade (Steve Franken). To increase publicity of the resort's grand opening, David has invited winter sports stars such as a ski jump champion named Gary; the downhill skier and notorious playboy, Bruce Scott (Rick Moses); and Olympic skaters Cathy Jordan (Pat Egan) and Annette River (Peggy Browne).Greeting Caroline, David relates his pride in the resort and the struggle it took to build it, noting that he may be implicated in an investigation of a planning commissioner. Putting his woes aside, he expresses his desire to reconcile with Caroline. Meanwhile, on the skating rink, Cathy stumbles at the end of her routine and despite her coach's assurances, she worries that she'll never get it right.Out on one of the resort's hillsides, McDade and Florence encounter Nick Thorne (Robert Forster), a nature photographer who warns that the removal of the trees is rendering the slope unstable. Vowing to remind David of the environmental hazards at the resort, Nick tosses a snowball that easily rolls down the mountain.Elsewhere, Bruce is trying out the ski course when a small avalanche breaks above him. Racing ahead of the oncoming snow, Bruce is forced high up into a tree for safety. When the avalanche eventually stops, he jumps down on the snow and skies away.Later, Nick flags David down, insisting they talk about conditions on the mountain and David introduces Caroline as his wife to Nick. After Caroline leaves, Nick argues with David and ski patrol ranger, Phil Prentiss (Jerry Douglas), about whether enough precautions have been taken to safeguard the resort. Nick departs, running into Caroline who is swimming in the resort's pool. During a flirtatious exchange with Nick, Caroline clarifies that she's David's ex-wife and she expresses interest in seeing Nick at the party that night. As Nick heads outside, he sneaks explosives out of Phil's truck. Meanwhile, David greets popular talk show host Mark Elliott (Barry Primus) and informs Mark that his wife Tina is at the resort with Bruce.That night, Nick makes an unexpected appearance at the party and incites David's jealousy as he dances with Caroline. After arguing with David, Caroline goes home with Nick. In another cabin, Tina finds Bruce in bed with Annette, which sends her screaming into the snow in her underwear.In the morning, Nick leaves Caroline in bed to check out conditions on the mountain while Tina returns to argue with Bruce about his infidelity.In his office, David orders his lawyer, Marty Brenner (X Brands), to come to the resort to deal with the commissioner's investigation regardless of the dangerous flying conditions.Up on the mountain, Nick uses the purloined explosives to safely release pressure on a precariously dangling snow shelf.Back at the lodge, David presides over various grand opening celebrations and events while Mark Elliott covers the events on his talk show before taking a break to ski. As Mark boards the lift, he notices a little boy named Jason whose parents were going to leave him behind, and takes Jason up the mountain with him.Just then, Marty's airplane crashes into the mountain, triggering a massive avalanche. The snow sweeps away all people on the lift, including Jason's parents, and knocks Gary down in the middle of his ski jump. Bruce races downhill to outrun the avalanche, but this time the snow overtakes him. Caroline watches the disaster from Nick's place, where she is protected from the devastation by the house's remote location.At the ice rink, where David judges the competition from the observation booth, Cathy finally successfully completes her skating routine, just before the avalanche crushes her. The lodge collapses, crushing Tina in her room just as she's about to commit suicide and trapping Florence and McDade in the dining room. When the avalanche subsides, the survivors take stock of the situation. Mark and Jason are stranded on the ski lift as Nick digs through the snow to rescue Phil near the ranger station. When David crawls out of the collapsed observation booth and encounters Phil, the men decide to use the rest of Phil's explosives to clear a path into the hotel and free any trapped guests.At the lodge, David and Caroline reunite and look for Florence.On the mountain, Annette is desperate to find Bruce, who is stuck upside down in an air pocket, submerged in snow. Though Bruce tries to alert rescuers to his location, it is too late to save his life. David and McDade dig toward each other and finally create a way out of the lodge. Florence is unconscious from a gas leak, but Caroline saves her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then accompanies her to the hospital on the ambulance.Meanwhile, the ski lift chair falls away, leaving Mark and Jason swinging from the lift line. As rescuers set a net under them, Jason drops to safety, but before Mark can join him, the lift line is momentarily reconnected to its power source and he is electrocuted.David learns that Florence's route to the hospital may be cut off so he and Nick race to find her. Just then, the speeding ambulance skids on the ice and spins out of control. As the vehicle goes over the bridge and explodes, Caroline is thrown outside and left clinging to a weak railing. Nick and David arrive just in time to rescue her, and David realizes Florence is dead.Back at the destroyed resort, Caroline says goodbye to Nick and goes to see David. As they toast their survival with a bottle of champagne that Caroline finds, David says he knows he is the cause of the devastation and the end of their marriage. Caroline marvels at his admission. As Caroline leaves the resort in a taxi, David stands alone in the wreckage of his empire."

Six former classmates receive invitations one day to a high school reunion. When they arrive at their alma mater, however, they find that not only are they the only ones to have receved letters, the invitations were actually sent by a deranged preacher intending to murder them all as punishment for their wicked ways. Will any of them escape from the remote schoolhouse alive, or will they all meet their final judgement?—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> A strange boy, named Christopher, rises from the depths of a small lake and visits a sleeping priest, casting a spell over the man. Later that day at church, Christopher arrives at the church in a school shuttle bus where he and a group of other boys change into robes as part of the church's boys choir. One boy tells unfunny and sordid jokes and threatens Christopher with a knife when he does not laugh. Afterwords, Christopher sits with the boys choir as the priest delivers a sermon about sinners and the wrath of God.At an abandoned high school, a janitor lets in a stranger who claims to be an insurance inspector, but who shoots the janitor dead in the swimming pool area, drags the body into a classroom, and prepares a plaster cast of the man's head. Later, the stranger pulls out a yearbook for the Class of 1967 and opens it to the ""Most Likely To Succeed"" page that features six students, three boys and three girls, and cuts out each photograph.Among those pictured in the yearbook is John Sinclair, a dodgy lawyer who only represents wealthy clients, even if they are criminals; Terry Day, a gluttonous traveling businessman who cheats on his wife with a drive-in waitress; Jane, a wealthy trophy wife in a loveless marriage who ""skeet shoots"" live pigeons; Roger, a vain and ornery actor who causes endless difficulties on the set; Kirsten, a closeted lesbian who is ashamed of her life who tells her live-in lover, Petra, that she cannot go with her to her high school reunion; and Cindy Pilson, a promiscuous woman, twice married and divorced who engages in partying at local bars.Some days later, the six arrive at their former high school, now-shuttered Stuart Morse Academy, for their ten-year reunion. Roger notes that the school doors are locked, and assumes they must be early. They knock, and the stranger, posing as the janitor, lets them in. The group enters the cafeteria where a feast awaits. They enjoy the food, although Cindy wonders why no other classmates have yet arrived. John offers to call a former classmate who still lives in the area and Jane joins his search for a payphone.Back in the cafeteria, Cindy remembers that another classmate lives within walking distance and leaves to find her. As John and Jane realize the phone lines are dead, Cindy notices all of the exits are locked. She searches for the janitor, but finds a dead, maggot-covered body. As the group gathers around the janitor's body, they realize he has been dead for several days and that the man who greeted them earlier was not the janitor. As they separate and check the windows and doors, George notes that all of the windows have bars.In another part of the school, Kristen yells through one of the locked gates when she spots a stranger in the distance. Realizing it is a masked man swinging a scythe, she runs away screaming. John and Terry notice music coming from the public address system. As they enter the audio/visual room, they notice a man sitting in a chair with his back turned to them. When they swing the chair around, they see a dummy holding a live blowtorch, which sets Terry on fire and burns him alive.Later, the five remaining alums wonder if they are victims of a revenge plot but they are unable to think of a reason. John notes that the school is isolated and that no one is around to see or hear them, so Kirsten suggests they start a fire to draw the attention of the fire and police department. As they separate to gather material to burn, Jane returns to the cafeteria for tablecloths and hears a door opening. She runs outside for help and comes across a hunter carrying a shotgun. She pleads with him to take her to the nearest phone, but as they walk, Jane realizes the ""hunter"" is the stranger and he has led her back to the school where he chases her down before shooting her. Later, the four survivors find Jane's dead body laid out on the cafeteria table.Back in the stairwell, they plan what to do next but follow sounds coming from the auditorium, where a strange show is in progress. The stranger, dressed in a black cape and a mask, recites a Shakespearean speech as a sword-bearing puppet dances. Entranced, Roger moves toward the stage as a dagger falls from the ceiling, impaling him in the head. Terrified, John runs away leaving Kirsten and Cindy alone. He runs into the empty library and finds their old yearbook with their pictures cut out.Meanwhile, Kirsten and Cindy go to the bathroom, but when Kirsten steps outside, the stranger, now dressed as a clown, locks the door behind him, trapping Cindy and taunting her before drowning her in the bathroom sink.Later, the stranger, now disguised in a business suit and mustache, confronts John in the library. As the stranger holds him at gunpoint, John demands to know why he wants them dead and the stranger proclaims that they are sinners and he is their redeemer. John lunges and they struggle over the gun, but John manages to shoot the stranger in his right hip while they both have their hands on the weapon. Refusing to let go, the stranger turns the gun on John and shoots him in the head.Hearing the commotion, Kirsten runs toward the library and comes face to face with the stranger, then runs, screaming as he chases her back to the auditorium. Bleeding and stumbling from his injury, the stranger drops the gun. As she scrambles and picks up the gun, the puppet swings its sword at her head, killing her.Back at church, the film comes full circle as the priest finishes his fiery sermon. After the service ends, the priest (who is finally revealed to be the killer) meets with Christopher, who has revealed to have killed a bully who earlier threatened him and placed the dead body in the car of a con artist Bible salesman who visited the church (so that the con artist will get blamed for the young bully's murder). Christopher tells the Redeemer that everything will be all right now, and that he is pleased with the Redeemer's work. The Redeemer then goes back to his apartment where he tends to his bullet wound to his abdomen that he received earlier, and also reveals that he has two thumbs on his left hand, one of which then fades away along with his gunshot wound. The Redeemer quotes to himself that God is pleased with what he has done and he will be waiting for any future work. In the final scene, Christopher takes the church shuttle bus back to the lake from the opening scene and walks (fully clothed) back into the lake to return from where he came.The film closes with the text: ""From out of the darkness the hand of the Redeemer shall appear to punish those who have lived in sin... and return to the watery depths of Hell""."

The Big Fix,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077233/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ex-'60s radical now working as a private eye is hired by an old flame to investigate a political smear campaign. The case becomes more dangerous as it unfolds. In Los Angeles, Moses Wine, who was part of the counter-culture of the late 1960s at UC-Berkeley, still has those radical feelings but no longer does anything about them. His wife Suzanne, who has transformed from a 1960s hippie to a 1970s new-ageist, divorced him when his law school background didn't materialize into the upper middle class liberal life she was expecting, she having sole custody of their two young sons, with Moses having visitation rights. Moses fell into work as a private investigator of the gumshoe variety, which usually doesn't cover his monthly child support payments. After not seeing her for ten years, Moses is contacted by Lila Shea, an old girlfriend from Berkeley, to do some investigative work on behalf of her boss, Sam Sebastian, the Southern California coordinator for the gubernatorial campaign of Congressman Miles Hawthorne. Lila felt Moses would be well suited to the job because of running within ""the"" crowd at Berkeley, even if only knowing the main players by name and reputation. Flyers have been circulating with a doctored photo of Hawthorne and Howard Eppis in a friendly embrace, Eppis who in the late 1960s was part of the California 4 - the other three being Michael and Wendy Linker, and Luis Vasquez - an anti-establishment group convicted of several counts related to their work against the government. While the Linkers are behind bars probably for the rest of their lives, Luis Vasquez is a free man working for the rights of Mexican laborers, while Eppis has been a fugitive ever since, the authorities who are still looking for him. The flyers, which contain extreme socialist rhetoric and an implication of Hawthorne welcoming Eppis' endorsement, have the potential to derail Hawthorne's campaign. Moses is tasked with finding out who is behind the flyers - the most obvious being the campaign of Hawthorne's competitor, Senator Dillworthy - and if it is indeed not Eppis, why they would have specifically used Eppis' name. Moses accepts the job despite not endorsing Hawthorne - or Dillworthy for that matter - he equating Hawthorne's excitement factor to watching paint dry. The further Moses and Lila get into the investigation, the number of unanswered questions they have grows, and the more people who were associated with Eppis at the time cannot be located, including Oscar Procari, Jr., who funded the California 4's defense probably to spite his industrialist father. With the many trails, Moses and Lila still believe finding Eppis would answer many questions. All the while, Moses tries to rekindle a relationship with Lila.

Her mother died during childbirth, then a kitchen accident leaves half her face disfigured. This is an artistic exploration of beauty and disfigurement, society's values, and, more importantly how a girl, teenager, and bride was treated during the times. Rajeev (Shashi Kapoor), the stereotype male engineer, falls in love with Rupa, who has a divine singing voice and the unscarred left cheek. When he sees the scarred cheek after marriage, he heads off into a tizzy and continues nightly dalliance with his mistress--the beautiful cheek. Little does he realize that his wife and mistress are two faces of the same person.—MG Gopalan The story is set in a village where Roopa (Zeenat Aman) lives with her father, the village priest Pandit Shyam Sunder (Kanhaiyalal). As a young child (Padmini Kolhapure), the right side of Roopa's face and neck were burned by a pot of boiling oil (which she spilled on herself while cooking a meal for her father), leaving part of her face disfigured.

American Hot Wax,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077158/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofAlan Freed, the pioneering disc jockey who was instrumental in introducing and popularizing rock 'n' roll in the 1950s. This is the story loosely based on Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed, who introduced rock 'n' roll to teenage American radio audiences in the 1950s. Freed was a source of great controversy: criticized by conservatives for corrupting youth with the ""devil's music""; hated by racists for promoting African American music for white consumption; persecuted by law enforcement officials and finally brought down by the ""payola"" scandals.—Martin Lewison <lewison+@pitt.edu> In 1959 New York City, disc jockey Alan Freed (Tim McIntire) starts his shift at radio station WROL. Inside the booth, he finds a note on top of a stack of rock 'n' roll records that reads: ""WROL Don't Play List."" Alan tosses the note aside and plays one of the records on air. As Alan continues to broadcast rock 'n' roll music, his show is enjoyed throughout the city.Sometime later, station manager Peter ""Pete"" Overmyer (Stephen Pearlman) storms into Alan's booth, furious that the disc jockey has ignored his ""don't play"" list. Overmyer explains that the New York City police department and the Board of Health, among other local establishments, have issued complaints about the station broadcasting rock 'n' roll music; Overmyer begs Alan to play popular singers such as Patti Page or Pat Boone. Alan's colleagues Sid (Will Thornbury) and Gordie (Pat McNamara) chuckles in the booth as Alan ignores Overmyer's threats. When Overmyer storms away, Sid asks Alan about the upcoming rock 'n' roll concert Alan is organizing and questions why the music sparks such controversy, but Alan is unable to explain.As Alan continues his radio show, an African-American group called The Chesterfields (Carl Earl Weaver, Al Chalk, Sam Harkness, Arnold McCluller) comes to the station wanting to sing for Alan. Meanwhile, Alan's secretary, Sheryl (Fran Dresher), and his driver, Mike, bicker in the reception area as music industry men arrive at the station, eager for Alan's attention. At the end of the night, a young hopeful named Teenage Louise (Laraine Newman) corners Alan in the elevator and pitches one of her original songs, but Alan is unimpressed. Louise follows Alan outside, where he is serenaded by The Chesterfields. When Alan expresses interest in the group and invites them to come back, Louise strikes up a conversation with the musicians and The Chesterfields agree to perform one of her original songs.Elsewhere in New York City, district attorney Coleman (John Lehne) and his associates listen to a recording of Alan's show and Coleman explains that Alan has a strong influence on the public. Referring to rock 'n' roll as a threat to society, Coleman announces his plan to shut down Alan's upcoming concert.Later, Alan holds court at a bar with a stream of admirers. Alan runs into a disc jockey friend. He tells Alan that his show was taken off the air when he played rock 'n' roll. Just then, two of Coleman's associates, Phillips (Jack Edward Ellis) and Donahue (Richard Forbes), show up at the bar. When Donahue chastises Alan for playing ""spook"" music and for negatively influencing young people, Alan's friend calls Donahue a ""bigot"" and a shouting fight ensues. Later, as Mike drives Alan home, he expresses concern that Alan's concert will be canceled. Mike reminds Alan that a rock 'n' roll concert in Boston, Massachusetts, provoked a riot. When Mike asks if rock 'n' roll will be threatened by government action, Alan responds affirmatively but assures Mike that rock music will not perish.The next morning at WROL, people clamor for Alan's attention. While some musicians are looking for a record deal, others are vying for a slot at Alan's concert. Meanwhile, The Chesterfields, Louise, and Artie Moress (Moosie Drier), the 12-year-old president of the Buddy Holly fan club, wait for Alan outside. When Alan sees the group of hopefuls, he invites them to join him for the day. After visiting a mansion that Alan intends to purchase despite the protests of its owner, who finds Alan disreputable, the young musicians accompany Alan to a live recording session with The Planotones.Meanwhile, Coleman learns from Phillips and Donahue that Alan has been covertly accepting $600 a week in ""payola"" bribes from record labels; however, Alan refuses to play records that he doesn't like and Coleman is discouraged in his effort to denounce the disc jockey. The next day, The Chesterfields visit Louise's house to work on a song as Louise's mother looks on disapprovingly.At WROL, Alan invites young Artie to share his feelings about Buddy Holly on air. Later, Alan receives a long-distance call from his father and is saddened by the man's refusal of financial support. Meanwhile, Louise argues with her father, who wants her to go to college instead of pursuing her music career but Louise insists on doing things her way and performs a song on the piano.Back at the radio station, Overmyer pulls Alan aside and demands that the disc jockey sign an affidavit stating that he ""did not receive money or gifts,"" or ""payola,"" to play rock 'n' roll records, but Alan refuses. When Overmyer claims that disc jockeys across the country have signed the document, Alan insists that they are lying. Although Overmyer warns Alan that the station cannot legally protect him unless he signs, Alan retorts that they want to censure him for broadcasting rock 'n' roll, not for receiving bribes.The next night, teenagers line up outside the Brooklyn Paramount Theater in anticipation of Alan's show, waiting to buy tickets. Alan arrives at the venue to talk to his fans and to appease the concerns of police officers who fear another riot. When Louise begs Alan to let The Chesterfields perform one of her songs, Alan denies her request but gives her tickets for the show, promising that everything will work out. Meanwhile, a television news program reports on the long lines at the event and the anchor notes that the audience may resort to ""jungle instincts"" when the music starts.On the night of the concert, a raucous, multicultural audience enjoys the show as law authorities watch from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Phillips and Donahue search Alan's dressing room for marijuana, hoping to implicate him in a crime, but they come up empty-handed. During the show, Alan takes the stage and introduces Teenage Louise as an up-and-coming songwriter. When the Chesterfields perform her song, the crowd goes wild, and Louise is thrilled by her big break. As the show continues, Alan gets news that Jerry Lee Lewis is not coming as planned and, later, Alan comforts Louise as she cries that her love of music has isolated her from her family. The theater's box office receipts are seized by Internal Revenue Service agents and Alan is informed that he does not have the capital to pay the musicians.Sitting backstage with Chuck Berry, Alan questions if the show can go on and hears the crowd grow increasingly impatient. As Coleman looks on, a police officer orders Alan to quiet the crowd, but Chuck Berry offers to perform for free and takes the stage. As the audience cheers, Phillips warns Alan to control them. When Jerry Lee Lewis unexpectedly arrives, Coleman plans to take charge of the event by turning on the house lights. Thrilled by Lewis's performance, the crowd dances in the aisles, provoking Coleman to declare the event a fire hazard as he accuses Alan of turning the kids into animals. The police fight with audience members, including young Artie, and the lights come up in the theater, but Lewis demands that the lights be dimmed for the duration of his act. Lewis's defiance incites the crowd as Alan argues with the authorities, warning that the cancellation of the concert will not diminish the popularity of rock 'n' roll. As lights come up again, police officers and audience members clash and a full-scale riot ensues, despite Alan's protests.Outside, the crowd filters into the city as a lone street musician plays rock 'n' roll on makeshift drums.The film abruptly ends with an epilogue text stating that this was Alan Freed's last performance, and that he was taken off the air, indicted for inciting a riot, accepting payola bribes and income tax evasion. He moved to California and died there five years later in January 1965 from alcoholism at age 43, penniless.... but that rock n' roll lives on."

But, when he falls for one of the boys he meets and starts bringing the young man into his family, the risks escalate. What he does not know is that the political opposition knows of his vice and have planted the boy.—havan_ironoak@bigfoot.com SPOILER - - I thought the detailed description and photos I saw on another site made this movie appear much more interesting than it was. Even considering it was made in 1978. The movie opens to find the progragonist, Roberto Orbea in his car, looking down a short downhill street at two policemen, standing at the bottom of the street. He worries when they and the country will find out about ""the scandal."" For the next 15 or 20 minutes, which seems like forever, various figures in different scenes run through all the political charges which appear in his police file, scenes of implied brutal interrogations, sometimes even reading extensively right out of a file folder. For most viewers, 4 or 5 minutes of that would have been more than enough to set the tone. After that the next hour plus is a very boring look at his committment to politics, the struggle he has with his homosexuality, somewhat assuaged by his many trysts with very young rent boys. Of course I didn't expect porn, but the few decent shots of nude males were mostly either too dark to see anything or were obscured by the english subtitles. There is exactly one male/male kiss. All the while the few in the know including himself keep saying if they discover he's a homosexual, he will never be elected Secretary General. He toys with the idea of resigning. Supposedly he falls in love with the last rent boy, his wife decides she's had enough pretending not to know and they foolishly embark on a threesome, sexually and non-sexually getting photographed extensively by the opposition. The rent boy is interrogated about the photos, then kidnapped, and Roberto has to go to where they are holding him, Roberto's own secret apartment but when he arrives the boy has already been murdered. As the movie continues it seems he decided not to resign, the final scene shows a crowd and he with a few others are on a podium - apparently he was elected Secretary General after all. At this point the film abruptly ends and we have no idea what ultimately happens with the ""discovery of scandal"" (or if it even occurred) that loomed over the whole darn film. I did not enjoy this."

Barracuda,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077210/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Little coastal town is being terrorized by deadly Barracudas. A top secret government experiment leads to fatal barracuda attacks on the beaches of a small coastal town formerly renowned for its lobster. A marine biologist and sheriff uncover a plot involving a mentally unstable former war-medic pioneering research into hypoglycemia and its effects on human behavior. In the coastal village of Palm Cove, Florida, two government agents posing as land developers arrive in town.On a stretch of nearby beach, Mike Canfield (Wayne Crawford), a marine biologist, tests for polluted waste from the town's manufacturing plant, Jack Chemical Company. As Mike dives to collect underwater samples near the drainage pipes offshore, the plant's owner, Papa Jack (Bert Freed), orders his son, Bubba (Jerry Rhodes), to detain the marine biologist and notify the Sheriff. When Mike is arrested for trespassing, he instructs an assistant to grab the samples tucked inside his Scuba fin so he will have proof of the plants environmental misconduct.After spending the night in jail, Mike is treated with hospitality by Sheriff Ben Williams (William Kerwin) who plans to release him as soon as the judge is available. That day, a barracuda attacks and kills a young man while he is diving for lobsters, and later a young girl and her dog stumble upon the diver's severed head on the beach.While investigating the scene, Ben tries to keep Floyd (Bob J. Shields), the local newspaper reporter, from turning the accident into front-page news. During a meeting with Papa Jack, Government Agent #2 (Rich Rhodes) warns that his organization, which represents a lucrative contract for the plant, is concerned about the breach by the marine biologist (Mike). Until a security evaluation is conducted, Papa Jack's delivery orders are on hold. Suddenly, Bubba rushes in to inform his father that thousands of dead, mangled fish have washed up on the beach. Papa Jack issues a hasty statement to Floyd that the waters have been thoroughly tested and this phenomenon is only temporary.During lunch at the local diner, Ben and his deputy, Lester (Cliff Emmich), notice that several of the town's residents are behaving aggressively and assume the behavior is heat-related.The next day, Ben learns that a second swimmer has died from a fish attack, and Mike returns to Palm Cove, with his girlfriend Liza Williams (Robert Leighton) to help with the investigation. Although water samples indicated trace elements of other chemicals besides the plants usual fertilizers and pesticides, Mike is reluctant to link the pollution to the accidents until he collects more evidence. Ben thinks the local doctor, Elliot Snow (Jason Evers), will be amenable to letting Mike use his lab for analysis.The next morning before dawn, Ben pilots the boat offshore from the plant, and Mike dives for additional samples. After encountering a school of barracudas, he surfaces in a panic and instructs Ben to net some of the lethal fish for testing.At the doctors lab, Mike studies the barracuda specimens, but Snow suggests that he is leaping to conclusions by trying to connect the chemical plant to fish activity. Meanwhile, Papa Jack receives a threatening phone call that there will be serious consequences unless he can contain the situation, which is now a front-page headline: 'Chemical Plant Creates Killers in the Deep'. After Mike identifies other trace chemicals like glucose, he takes a break and leaves the lab.Mike is resting on the cot inside the jail, when Floyd arrives and pesters him about the latest developments in the case. Mike states that the plant is definitely responsible for contaminating the water, but the fish attacks are still under investigation.Floyd quickly returns to the newspaper office, but along the way he is followed. After Floyd tells his assistant Toby (Scott Avery) that this story will make them famous, Government Agent #1 (director Harry Kerwin) enters and guns down the two reporters. Maggie Snow (Bobbie Ellyne Kosstrin), the doctor's daughter, also becomes a victim when she arrives to meet her boyfriend, Toby.Meanwhile, Mike returns to the lab and suspects that Snow has tampered with the samples. While poking around the doctor's study, he discovers a file titled 'The Lucifer Project', which documents experiments that Snow has been conducting on patients, correlating low blood sugar levels and aggressive behavior using chemicals like glucose.Realizing that the doctor is somehow connected to the pollution, Mike returns to the Sheriff's residence. Agitated, Mike describes to Ben how Snow is trying to control the behavior of the town's population. He explains that the doctor is injecting chemicals into human beings that prevent absorption of nutrients, leading to low blood sugar, a condition that encourages aggression. He adds that these chemicals, manufactured at the plant, must have been leaked into the ocean, causing fish to also be nutrient-deprived and go hungry. Because the barracuda is a heartier fish, it can survive by eating weaker fish, but eventually the barracuda begins to prey on humans to ward off starvation. If the evidence of the strange fish behavior had not surfaced, the plot might have gone undetected.Grabbing his gun, Ben drives to the chemical plant to investigate, while Mike and Liza track down Lester and instructs him to radio for back up from the state police. Lester and Liza leave town to get help. In the process, Mike learns about the killing of the two newspaper reporters and Maggie Snow.At the doctor's office, Mike confronts Elliot Snow, blaming him for Maggie's death and for using the town's population as guinea pigs. Snow confesses that the project was used as a war preparation tactic, to ensure that the populace would welcome aggression and not protest it. Clutching a photograph of his daughter, Snow realizes that the experiments must be stopped and reveals that the government is controlling the project.At the plant, Ben discovers the murdered body of Papa Jack, and encounters the two agents who begin shooting at him. Mike arrives to assist Ben and a shootout happens. Soon, several state police cars arrive at the plant, and Ben orders the officers to take the two agents into custody. After the two agents throw down their weapons and appear to surrender, Agent #1 turns to the police cars, lowers his hands and shouts, ""Fire!"" The officers (in league with the government agents), point their weapons at Mike and Ben and shoot them both dead in a hail of bullets and buckshot.(In some versions of the film, a on-screen text of the aftermath shows news reports which announce that the town of Palm Grove has been evacuated on account of an environmental hazard in the local waters. There is no mention of the barracuda attacks or of the murders in the town as well as the Lucifer Project.)"

Molière,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077941/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Who was Moliere? He is known everywhere as one of the world's greatest playwrights. But who was he? Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in 1622, the son of a prosperous tapestry maker. His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. Poquelin developed his stagecraft adapting Commedia dell Arte plots to please brutalized peasants and cynical townspeople. He also married Madeline Bejart, the widowed daughter of the troupe's founder. Later he entered into a love affair with Mme Bejart's daughter, to the dismay of all. The troupe eventually returned to Paris and, on October 24, 1658, greatly impressed the 20-year old King Louis XIV, later to be called the Sun King. Moliere's life became bound up with the magnificent court at Versailles, and with its intrigues. He wrote, staged and acted in the plays now famous all over the world. He fought with his enemies and his friends, enjoyed success followed by failure, organized court festivities and defended himself against increasingly fanatic religious authorities. Above all, his theater was taken from life as his life was theatrical.—John Christopher <johnpickman@excite.com> revised by John Chapot Returning to Paris after years spent touring the countryside with his troupe, during which they gained fame for their skill at farce, Molière contemplates what to present in Paris. He would like to write a serious work, but his troupe mates object that he's no good at tragedy; and his royal patron also insists on comedy. He then reflects upon the events that led to the troupe's travels. The unfolding of this story constitutes most of the film, beginning with the troupe's bankruptcy.Molière is rescued from debtor's prison by a wealthy man who wants to hire him to coach him in acting and writing skills for the purpose of wooing a charming young woman - never mind that he is married - with payment conditional on his success. Desperate, Molière agrees, and comes to live in the man's household disguised as a priest hired to tutor the younger of two daughters. A keen observer, Molière quickly discovers that his employer is comically inept at everything he attempts; his supposed friend, supposedly conveying messages and gifts to the object of his ardor, is swindling him; his wife is kind, attractive and intelligent, and deserves better; and the older daughter has a romance that she keeps secret from her father, with her mother's tacit approval.Can Molière succeed at his task without becoming embroiled in all of these twists and turns as they wind their way toward an improbable convergence? Clearly not: Molière has found himself a player in a hilarious real-life farce, entangling himself ever more deeply and ultimately discovering the currents of tragedy that flow beneath the surface of the absurd."

Impassively, the boy mounts Luke's horse, claiming it along with its ornate silver-trimmed saddle, and rides off.Several years later, the young boy has grown up into a rugged bounty hunter named Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma) who rides into the Texan town of Cerriotts on his silver-saddled horse, accompanied by Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), an amusing but treacherous man he recently met outside of town. Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake. This is why he wants to tag along: Snake collects items of value from the frequent corpses encountered at every turn in the Wild West. Roy's arrival is also noted by Turner, a mysterious blonde-haired cowboy (Gianni De Luigi).Roy meets with Shiba (Licinia Lentini), a well-to-do madam of the town's local whorehouse, who is also an old flame who wants more. She tells Roy that a man called Shep is extorting money from her, for a Mexican named Grenache (Aldo Sambrell). Her business will be ruined unless she pays up the following day. Roy obligingly shoots Shep and some of his cronies. Once again Snake turns up, shadowing Roy for spoils. The blond cowboy appears and makes a deal with Snake who offers it to Roy: $2,000 for a hit on one Thomas Barret, to be executed in a graveyard out of town. Roy is suspicious, but accepts the murder contract when he hears the name of Barret.At the graveyard, Roy is crouching with a rifle aiming at carriage that rolls up as arranged. Instead of the old man Roy was hoping to shoot, a young boy (Sven Valsecchi) emerges, carrying a funeral wreath. As the child approaches, several men emerge to shoot him. Roy's impulse is to save the boy's life. Roy shoots the would-be assassins and rides off with the boy. He discovers that he has rescued Thomas Barret Junior, the son of Richard Barret who swindled the young Roy's father years ago. Thomas tells Roy that his father, Richard Barret, has been dead for several years and he is currently being looked by his uncle, Thomas Barret Senior (Ettore Manni) whom he is named after. Angered at being cheated out of his revenge, Roy rides off in disgust, leaving the boy stranded in the hills with just a knife and blanket for protection.At the Barret estate, young Thomas' older sister, the beautiful Margaret (Cinzia Monreale), is distraught over her little brother's disappearance. Thomas Senior discusses the search with Turner his estate manager; the mysterious blond cowboy. Turner announces that he knows the identity of the kidnapper: Roy Blood. Immediately, a $5,000 reward is offered for Roy's head. Meanwhile, Snake offers a proposition for Roy. He has kidnapped young Tom, after Roy left the boy behind. He plans to ask for a huge ransom. Roy hears that it was Turner who had set up the graveyard hit as a device to kill the boy and Roy Blood, and blaming the outlaw for the killing.Roy hides out in Shiba's whorehouse, where she looks after Thomas Jr. Using sexual subterfuge, Shiba helps Roy discover the story of the Barret family. After Richard Barret died, the only ones who remained rich were the children, Thomas and Margaret. Thomas Sr. gambled away his part of the Barret fortune. If anything happened to Tom Jr. Margaret inherits everything. Plus, Turner has his eye on Margaret for whomever marries her stands to inherit the whole fortune.When Tom Jr. is spotted by Turner at the whorehouse, Roy whisks him off to the San Jacinto monastery several miles away. The Padre of the monastery totes a gun and promises to protect the boy for Roy while he goes back out to find Turner and his men. After a tense shootout at an abandoned farm, Roy gets the better of the evil Turner, who dies in a trough of stale water. Just as things seem resolved, Garrincha's bandits attack the monastery and grab the boy, murdering all the monks. The local sheriff (Phillppe Hersent) arrests Roy Blood, thinking that he's an accomplice of Garrincha. A huge ransom of $10,000 is made for the save return of Tom Jr. Thomas Sr. goes against the advice of the law and dispatches a rider, named Fletcher (Donald O'Brien), with the money. But the courier is murdered by Garrincha after handing over the cash at the bandits settlement.Meanwhile, Margaret helps Roy escape from jail, and he teams up with Snake to track down Garrincha. The find the Garrincha hideout thanks to Tom Junior's ingenuity: he flies a kite to alert help. They arrive to find Garrincha flogging the boy after he discovers the signal kite. Roy and Snake shoot it out with Garrincha's men and the rescue is successful, but Snake dies after Garrincha shoots him, before being shot himself by Roy.Back at the Barret ranch, Roy returns with Tom Jr. where he exposes the final betrayal. Thomas Senior has been in league with Turner, planning to dispose of both his nephew and Margaret so he can have the whole estate for himself. The kidnapping stunt with Garrincha was part of the plan to avert suspicion from him. He'd also planned to kill Turner once he married Margaret as the final plan enacted.

Mouth to Mouth,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077951/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mouth to Mouth follows the lives of four young people, trying to improve their lives in a harsh and unforgiving city. Two 16-year-old girls, Carrie (Kim Krejus) and Jeannie (Sonia Peat) escape from a girls reformatory after a fight with other girls. They meet up with Tony, an old boyfriend of Carrie, and end up with a number of youths in a panel van, who give them alcohol and take them first to a pub, and then back to a house nearby. Carrie gets drunk quickly and has sex with Tony, who then leaves her alone, before two of his mates arrive and try to have sex with her. Jeannie intervenes and saves Carrie and the girls leave, though we don't see where they spend the night.
In the next scene, the girls have a job behind the counter in a fast food shop. They meet Serge (Sergio Frazzetto) and Tim (Ian Gilmour), two nice country boys looking for work in the city. Serge has a car. The boys invite the girls for drinks at a pub. The four then go to the boys' boarding house for pizza and a snog. Jeannie likes the long-haired Serge, but Carrie is cool towards the more clean-cut Tim, as she still likes Tony, despite his treatment of her. The four go to a motel where they hope Serge's brother will let them spend the night in one of the empty rooms. But it doesn't work out, and so there is only time for a little hugging and kissing before the brother's wife kicks them all out.
The girls then take the boys to a place they know, some old abandoned offices by the railway, where they have stayed before. There are some old mattresses and blankets and things, so the four sleep the night there. This becomes their base for much of the film. The boys spend the days looking for work, asking at business after business without success. The girls work until their temporary jobs finish, then take to shoplifting to get food and clothes. (The boys get the dole, but the girls cannot apply as they are escapees.)
Carrie visits her father's house to pick up some clothes, but her father is away, and his girlfriend tells her that the cops are looking for her after her escape. The girls go to the pub one night and run into Tony and his mates, and they argue when the girls reject them. They reject a group of migrant men in a fancy car, then meet up with Fred, a friendly homeless old man they knew in the past who also lives in the abandoned offices. The four are getting on better and function as two couples now. They head for a beach outside Melbourne one day and spend the night in an empty house there.
This continues for some time, but the girls get sick of stealing and being poor, and decide to try work as escorts, even if it might involve having sex. They both go out and have different experiences: Jeannie hates it even though she didn't have to have sex, while Carrie likes the easy money and decides to try it a few more times. Both the boys feel uncomfortable about the situation, but still haven't found work.
Tony returns and invites Carrie to a party down the coast, but Carrie decides that she doesn't trust him. Jeannie tries door to door sales and then goes to visit her mum. A neighbour tells her that her mother had a breakdown and is in hospital. Carrie continues with prostitution but resorts to drugs to deal with it. She passes out on the way home and is helped by Fred, then Jeannie. Another day, Tony comes back with a mate to see Carrie but she rejects him again. Angry he attacks Fred on the way out, leaving him unconscious. Carrie finds him and takes him to the hospital, but the police followup and find the others living there. They arrest Jeannie and take her back to the reformatory, and confiscate their possessions. When Carrie returns from the hospital she finds the place empty.
In the final scenes, we see Jeannie back behind bars, the boys coming to visit her, and Carrie wandering the dark streets by herself, looking older and more thoughtful."

Thampu,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078381/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Besides a long glittering river, some men raise a pole. A tent balloons up. Where there was wide sand and the sound of water lapping, there is now a truck, chairs, hoops, stools, ropes, goats, a lioness, a pair of fat girls, some bicycles, and an old man with a philosopher's dignity, putting on white paste. Across a dirt road, the circus truck comes to a village. The tent goes up. Schoolboys run to the tent. Village women come and watch an acrobat roll a hoop across a tightrope. A lion leaps from the edge of one stool - across darkness - onto another stool. A gap-toothed old woman gazes at a goat on a tight rope; her eyes are wide with curiosity. For three days the circus makes small ripples in the life of this village. Municipal permits are required. At a toddy shop, a soldier befriends the circus strongman; a pump attendant sits on a rock each day watching a village girl bathe and dry her hair. The dwarf brings back to the circus a watermelon larger than his head. Aravindan Govindan's Thamp is a poetic, allegorical film, that gently explores the transience of human relationships and the rootlessness of the marginalized through the ripples created in the bucolic existence of a village on the banks of a river by the arrival of a roving circus troupe. In cinema-verite style, G. Aravindan rounded up a troupe of actual circus artistes and travelled with them to the village of Thirunavaya on the banks of the Bharathapuzha river. On the first day, the circus was set up and all the villagers were invited to watch the show. Aravindan said in an interview, ""We did not have a script and we shot the incidents as they happened. . . There were a lot of people who had not seen a circus before. We shot their responses as they were watching. After the initial hesitation, they forgot the lights and the shooting and got completely involved in the circus."" For three days, the circus is the centre of attention of village life, but soon the villagers lose interest and move on to the preparation for a local festival and the circus troupe packs up and trundles away leaving no trace. The theme of alienation is further explored through the irony of an upper middle class young man who on returning to his village from overseas finds himself isolated in his own milieu and hopes to escape his discontent by joining the circus troupe in their drifting existence. The beauty of the film lies in the reflective silences, the deeply observational, but delicate gaze of the camera, juxtaposing the pathos of the circus performers as they go about their everyday tasks and more starkly in impassive close-ups as they speak directly to the camera, against the innocent wonderment of the captivated village audience, in black and white imagery that stays with you long after the big tent has folded up."

The initial, sporadic outbursts of vocal protest over the Supreme Court's decision on May 5 to cancel Sanjay's bail for one month in the Kissa Kursi Ka (KKK) case (in which he is the principal accused), have subsided as rapidly as they surfaced.Even the news-starved media has abandoned him with equal promptness after tersely informing the public about his eating, sleeping and reading habits during his internment as a temporary guest of the Government. More significantly, it is also a measure of Mrs Gandhi's new political strategy that she has chosen to remain ominously silent about her son's dramatic detention last month. It is poetic justice that, among all his alleged sins, Sanjay finds himself behind bars for a case that has aroused the least public interest. Sanjay, along with Indira Gandhi's former information and broadcasting minister V.C. Shukla, is facing trial for allegedly destroying prints of a Hindi feature film KKK, produced by Janata Party MP, Amrit Nahata. Although the KKK case has had its fair share of high legal drama with key prosecution witnesses turning hostile with ominous regularity, public interest in the case has been virtually non-existent.A trunk that allegedly contained KKK prints being carried into Tis Hazari courtsIn fact, most people are under the mistaken impression that Sanjay's alleged destruction of the KKK prints is a relatively minor offence. Few are aware that if convicted in the KKK case, both Sanjay and Shukla can be liable to the maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Apathy: The main reason for public apathy in the KKK case is that media coverage of the hearing has been largely sporadic and threadbare owing to the innumerable adjournments, disturbances and stalling tactics that have dogged the KKK hearings since its inception last March. An additional factor is that it is one of the few cases which lacks the dual attraction of the involvement of Mrs Gandhi. V.C. Shukla, who has carefully maintained a very low profile since his fall from grace, is evidently an inadequate substitute. Ironically, Nahata, the man indirectly responsible for Sanjay's 30-day confinement in Tihar Jail, has aroused the least interest among the dramatis personae. In fact, a majority of Indians are not even aware of what the man looks like. Nahata himself, despite the notoriety of KKK, is an unlikely candidate for moviedom's Hall of Fame.An innocuous, self-styled film-maker (KKK was his third celluloid venture), Nahata has been forcibly catapulted into the limelight under rather bizarre circumstances. His original film, which was essentially a prophetic parody on Sanjay Gandhi, showing, in Nahata's own words, ""how unscrupulous politicians rape the dumb people of the country"", turned out to be a bigger parody in real life than the re-made version that finally appeared on the screen early this year.Sanjay arriving under heavy guard at Tis Hazari courts to testify - hoping for martyrdomParadoxically, Nahata has himself displayed a marked lack of scruples as far as his controversial film is concerned. When he originally made the film, in April 1975, Nahata was an MP owing allegiance to the Congress Party led by Mrs Gandhi, which was then in power. He has since jumped onto the Janata bandwagon without batting the proverbial eyelid. Flop: Also, despite its unexpected advance publicity, the re-made version of KKK turned out to be a damp squib, commercially and otherwise. The crudeness and the vague obscurity of the plot was in no way embellished by Nahata's commercially-oriented decision to replace the original heroine with busty calendar girl Katy Mirza. According to Nahata, he just barely managed to recoup the Rs 14 lakh he claims he spent on producing the film. Interestingly, in a letter to Shukla's successor, L.K. Advani in the immediate wake of Mrs Gandhi's electoral debacle in March 1977, Nahata wrote that ""were it (KKK) to be released even now, it would have broken all box office records. Looking at all these considerations, I would be entirely within the limits of reasonableness (sic) if I claim a compensation of one crore of rupees if you cannot return my film to me"". In fact, the ill-fated odyssey of the original KKK prints, around which the entire prosecution case revolves, actually reads more like a Fellini-type political parody than the celluloid version of KKK. Undoubtedly, Nahata's unfortunate choice of KKKs film script was either an act of suicidal bravery or one of uninhibited optimism.Left: Cans alleged to have contained KKK films being recovered from a nullah near Gurgaon. Right: The spot where the locks of the trunks containing KKK films were allegedly melted inside the Maruti factoryParody: When Nahata first submitted the KKK print for censorship clearance in April 1975, Indira Gandhi was already flexing her dictatorial muscles and Sanjay was emerging from the shadows. In the words of S.M. Murshid, joint secretary in the ministry of information and broadcasting, Nahata's film was a stringent critique of the politicians in power at that time, and contained thinly-veiled references to ""certain personages who were then very much in evidence in the upper echelons of political power"".It is difficult to imagine how Nahata expected his film to escape the censor's sharply-honed scissors even though the Emergency was still two months away. In KKK, the main political party had a ""people's car"" as its election symbol - an obvious take-off on Sanjay Gandhi's dubious Maruti car project.KKK also lampooned prominent Sanjay supporters like Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari, Indira Gandhi's private secretary R.K. Dhawan, and the Emergency femme fatale Rukhsana Sultana of Turkman Gate fame (played by Katy Mirza in the revised version).Seemingly undaunted, Nahata submitted his film to the Central Board of Film Censors in Bombay on April 19, 1975. Inevitably, there was a sharp difference of opinion within the examining committee when the film was screened for them on April 24, 1975. Three members recommended that the film be granted a 'U' certificate subject to some cuts, while one member and the then acting chairman, N.S. Thapa, insisted that the film be refused a certificate on the grounds that it was ""likely to arouse disrespect towards the country and incite incidence to overthrow the Government in power"". It was finally decided to refer the film to a revising committee. V.C. Shukla with his defence counsel - a low profileWhen KKK was screened before the seven-member revising committee on May 1, 1975 at Bombay's Academia Theatre, six members approved a 'U' certificate subject to the deletion of certain portions. Thapa, however, who was acting chairman while the incumbent chairman V.D. Vyas was away on leave, vetoed the unanimous decision and directed that the matter be passed on to the Central Government. Meanwhile, Nahata was instructed to forward the positive print of KKK to the Film Division auditorium on Delhi's Mahadev Road, while the official KKK file was dispatched to the Information Ministry. According to Nahata, he deposited one positive print of his film KKK at the Mahadev Road auditorium on May 17, 1975. Objections: But Nahata had also seen the writing on the wall, and lost no time in attempting to foil the move. On June 12, 1975, he filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court requesting a writ of mandamus (order directing any public authority to perform its official duty) directing the Central Government to certify KKK for exhibition. However, while Nahata's petition was still hanging fire in the Supreme Court, the Information Ministry passed an order dated June 18, 1975, which stated that KKK was being examined by the Government and the case would be dealt with under the requisite provisions of the Cinematograph Act. The ministry added salt to the wound by handing Nahata a show cause notice issued by Joint Secretary Murshid, which listed a total of 51 separate objections to his film. Nahata's subsequent claim that the objections were ""frivolous"" and ""absurd"" seems largely justified, considering the nature of some of the objections. For instance, Objection 2 states that ""all portions of shots and sequence wherever the president or members of his council are shown wearing caps in Gandhian style being white, blue and yellow"". Objection 9 was to a line in the dialogue which merely states that ""I propose the only male member of this club, Miss Meera Devi, M. A. Politics, be put up as a Presidential candidate"": Similarly, another objection was to the line; ""Where is poverty in Jan Gan Desh? There are only poor."" Prosecution counsel Jethmalani visiting the Maruto factoryHowever, the Information Ministry, in its infinite wisdom, felt that these portions would ""ferment social unrest or discontent to such an extent as to incite people to crime and will promote disorder, violence, a breach of law or disaffection or resistance to the Government"". Three days after the show cause notice was issued, Mrs Gandhi decided to clamp down the Emergency, and shortly after, V.C. Shukla took over as information minister.Heavy Odds: Despite the odds piling up against him, Nahata was still determined to salvage his film. On July 11, 1975 he submitted a written reply to the 51 objections in which, contrary to his later claims, he stated that the characters in KKK were ""imaginary and do not refer to any political party or persons"".However, the fate of KKK had already been sealed at an alleged secret coordination committee meeting held on July 7, 1975 chaired by V.C. Shukla. The prosecution has alleged that during the meeting, Shukla had ordered that the film, including the original negatives, be seized.While this is still to be proved, it is significant that on the same day Nahata handed in his written reply (July 11). Joint Secretary Murshid had already passed an order stating that ""the film Kissa Kursi Ka should not be given a certificate for public exhibition on the grounds that it is against the interest and security of the state ..."". Murshid followed this up with another order dated July 14, which states that ""in exercise of the power conferred by sub-rule (I) of Rule 51 of the said Rules, the Central Government hereby declare the film Kissa Kursi Ka to be forfeited to the Central Government"".Government Property: On July 17, 1975, Nahata made a last-ditch attempt to rescue his film and re-applied to the Supreme Court asking for a stay of the seizure order. While the Supreme Court rejected Nahata's appeal, it also directed the Government to preserve the film material of KKK, negatives as well as the prints lying in the Bombay Film Laboratory, and deposit them with the Censor Board. With the film now officially the property of the Government, Nahata's role in the affair became a relatively minor one, while the brief but dramatic fight of the KKK phoenix entered its last mystery-shrouded lap. Chief Justice Chandrachud - dramtic judgementOn August 1, 1975 the Theatre Branch of the Bombay police seized all the KKK film material consisting of 5 steel trunks and 241 reels of film, including stills from the film, and handed the lot over to the Censor Board Office. However, the event that triggered off the mysterious disappearance of the KKK prints was Nahata's writ petition that came up before the Supreme Court on October 29, 1975. In its judgement, the Supreme Court ordered that the film be screened for the judges on November 17, 1975 at New Delhi.The order was passed on to the Information Ministry, who confirmed that the film would be screened on the day in question at the Mahadev Road auditorium. Nahata, grabbing desperately at straws, took additional precautions by booking the auditorium in his name for November 17, and also handed over advance payment for the hire.Hostile Witnesses: From this point onwards, the macabre sequence of events has been largely obscured by the conflicting evidence given by a number of key prosecution witnesses in the KKK case (all former employees of Sanjay's Maruti factory) who have inexplicably turned hostile.So far, out of the 26 prosecution witnesses examined, no less than ten have turned ""hostile"" in the witness box, while a similar number have been ""given up"" by prosecution lawyers because they had been allegedly ""won over"".While the sudden spate of hostile witnesses has caused undoubtable damage to the prosecution's case, it is also the reason why Sanjay finds himself languishing in Tihar Jail. In fact, the Supreme Court's 25-page judgement cancelling Sanjay's bail handed down by Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud clearly stated that there ""was satisfactory proof that the respondent (Sanjay) has abused his liberty by attempting to suborn the prosecution witnesses. He has therefore forfeited his right to be free"". The judgement then went on to list ""outstanding instances"" of attempts to suborn key prosecution witnesses.The entire prosecution case so far largely hinges on the evidence of R. B. Khedkar, one of the two approvers in the KKK case.Khedkar, a former security officer in Maruti, has testified that prints of KKK were burnt by him in the Maruti factory premises at Sanjay Gandhi's orders in late November 1975. According to his statement, the destruction of the film took place on two successive nights.He deposed that the film material was removed from the original trunks and burnt in a pit. He also stated that the film cans were stamped with the name of the laboratory alongside the title, Kissa Kursi Ka.Dramatic: In fact, the KKK hearings, in spite of its lack of public interest, has proved no less dramatic than the events that precipitated the case. Despite the unusual number of key witnesses turning hostile, the entire proceedings so far have been dominated by the Thespian-like figure of Ram Jethmalani the prosecution counsel for the state and one of the country's best-known legal luminaries. K.P. Sreedharan - prosecution witnessJethmalani, a plumpish, silver-haired man with deceptively innocent looks, is a commanding figure in court, with his dramatic gestures and the vocal cords of a stage actor. According to the prosecution case, the disappearance of the KKK prints had been instigated by Shukla, who had allegedly issued instructions on November 6 (10 days before the proposed screening of KKK for Supreme Court judges) that all the negative and positive prints of KKK lying in New Delhi and Bombay should be ""secretly collected"" and placed under his personal custody.K.P. Sreedharan, a prosecution witness has testified that the KKK prints were collected ""in the first week of November"" from the Mahadev Road auditorium by S. Ghosh, then deputy secretary in the Information Ministry. Sreedharan was at that time in charge of the Films Division auditorium. Another prosecution witness, M.I. Sethi, Bombay unit manager of the Films Division, has testified that he had brought the KKK prints from Bombay as ""a secret Government document"" in 13 steel trunks on November 9, 1975, by the Western Express. Stills from the remade version of KKK - (left) the Kursi that caused the controversy, and (right) Katy Mirza in a provocative poseSethi deposed that he was accompanied on the journey by M.N. Kane, another official in the Films Division. Sethi testified that Deputy Secretary Ghosh took delivery of the 13 trunks at New Delhi railway station on November 10. In short, what the prosecution counsels are essentially trying to prove is: Nahata deposited one positive print of KKK in the Films Division auditorium at Mahadev Road on 17.5.75 according to the order passed by the Information Ministry. The entire film material was packed in 13 steel trunks and brought to New Delhi railway station on November 10, 1975, by Kane and Sethi following instructions from senior officials in the Information Ministry. That these instructions emanated from V.C. Shukla. That the positive print in the Mahadev Road auditorium was collected by Deputy Secretary Ghosh on November 6, 1975, in his personal car, from where it was allegedly transferred to V.C. Shukla's staff car and driven to 1, Safdarjung road. The entire film material which arrived in New Delhi from Bombay on November 10 was received at the station by Ghosh and Shukla's special assistant, V. S. Tripathi, and allegedly loaded on two tempo vans belonging to Maruti. That the tempos were driven by two Maruti drivers, Charan Singh and Ram Chander (both of whom have turned hostile), to the former prime minister's house and thereafter to the Maruti factory at Gurgaon. The film material was unloaded and stored on the premises of Maruti. A few days later, allegedly under Sanjay's orders, security officer Khedkar (one of the two approvers) burnt all the film material along with assistant security officer Yadav and watchman Om Prakash, on two successive nights. Supreme Court was told repeatedly that the film was not traceable, and eventually on March 26, Deputy Secretary Ghosh filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that the film KKK had been ""mixed up"" with other films. After the March general election, Sanjay allegedly ordered the 13 trunks collected and had them destroyed. That Sanjay also allegedly destroyed all records in connection with the storage of the 13 steel trunks. That in spite of the destruction of the material, one trunk lid, one lock, one RCIA - showing 13 galvanized iron trunks and a stock register showing 13 trunks, one intact film can and 3 cm of burnt film were recovered from the Maruti factory premises. Struggle: The official KKK files of the Information Ministry highlight the ministry's 'struggle' to meet the Supreme Court's demands. A week before the screening date fixed by the Supreme Court (November 17,1975), the Information Ministry informed the Supreme Court that ""the print is not readily available and efforts are being made to trace it.""Accordingly, the Supreme Court extended the screening date to December 12, 1975. Two days before the proposed screening, on December 10, the Information Ministry again informed the Court that the film had not yet been traced.On December 11. the Additional Solicitor General, V.P. Raman, wrote a personal letter to V.C. Shukla, stating that ""the Court would take a very serious view if the film is not produced for being screened, as directed by it.""Shukla did not bother to reply himself. instead Ghosh replied on December 17, 1975 again parroting the refrain that the film could not be traced though ""all possible efforts were being made"". It is significant that the Information Ministry files show no trace of such ""efforts"" having being made.On December 19, 1975 Raman again wrote a personal letter to Shukla insisting that the film be produced for screening on January 22, 1976. The letter also stated that if the positive print was not available, a print should be made from the negatives.Ghosh again replied to Raman's letter on January 21, 1976 once again stating that the film was still untraceable. Raman wrote back to Shukla on January 23, 1976 stating that the Court, ""as a final chance,"" adjourned the screening to March 1, 1976. On March 26, Deputy Secretary Ghosh filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that the film could not be traced. Finally, Nahata himself put an end to the matter by suddenly withdrawing his petition from the Supreme Court on July 30. 1976. According to Nahata, he took this inexplicable step after Shukla threatened him with ""dire consequences"" if he did not withdraw his petition. While this sequence of events is still to be proved (Shukla and three senior officials of the Information Ministry are also facing contempt of court charges filed against them by the Advocate General in the Supreme Court), some of the contradictory statements given by the hostile witnesses so far, are equally revealing. For instance, Ram Chander, one of the Maruti drivers who allegedly transported the KKK prints to Maruti factory, made some interesting statements under cross examination by prosecution counsel. Q. Where are you employed these days? A. With Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund.Q. Are you concerned with Maruti Technical Services? A. No.Q. Is Sanjay Gandhi or Indira Gandhi in any manner concerned with Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial? A. She is the chairman and I am working as a driver under her. Q. Since when have you been a driver under her? A. Since February 1978. Q. You continue to be a driver of Indira Gandhi to this date? A. Yes. Stalling: There have been a host of similar contradictions regarding testimonies about the entries made in the Maruti registers regarding 13 steel trunks, and in the store's registers of Maruti.So far, however, Sanjay Gandhi's defence counsel, headed by Kundan Lal Arora, an aggressive but taciturn man, have been content with employing the usual stalling tactics, like challenging the appointment of the prosecution counsels and raising objections at almost every stage of the proceedings.""Naturally he has the right to employ every method at his disposal,"" shrugged Jethmalani, seemingly unconcerned over the unexpected twists and turns the KKK case has been taking. Arora, however, was less expansive. ""My lips are sealed. I refuse to discuss the case,"" was his terse comment to India Today.Meanwhile, the KKK hearings are fated to slide into further obscurity a la the Shah Commission unless something really dramatic takes place. Arora estimates the KKK case will probably drag on for at least another year, if not more, while Jethmalani is hoping the case will wind up by August.Jethmalani's premise is that ""the accused are banking on a change in the political climate"", a possibility that, at the present moment does not seem all that remote. However, what most observers are waiting to see is whether Sanjay's month-long confinement will have cured him of his habitual arrogance and his oft-displayed contempt for the law. THE CHARGES O.N. Vohra, Additional Districts and Sessions Judge, has charged Vidya Charan Shukla (accused No. 1) and Sanjay Gandhi (Accused No. 2) with 13 separate offences. The major charges against them are:That you (Shukla and Sanjay) along-with R.B. Khedkar, K.S.

They chose a poor male, Gangaram, who is employed on a meager wage of Two Rupees a day with his employer, who sells fake herbs and medicines, including one called 'Sanjay Sanjeevni'.The duo then bribe the two main contestants in order to force them to withdraw their names from the election, thus ensuring an easy win for Gangaram, who goes on to become the President-elect, after successfully wooing a naive and dumb poor woman named Janta (Public).On his very first day, Gangaram learns from his Kursee (Chair) that it is more practical for him to obey it's 8 commands, and he does so quite religiously.His Presidential Assistant, Deshpal, recruits a busty Private Secretary, Ruby Dixsana, for Gangaram's nightly pleasure.On the issue of poverty, he decides that mice and rats eat food grains, and are, therefore responsible for this problem, so he instructs the Government to pay a reward of Ten Rupees for every dead mouse.Corrupt Government employees instead accept a One Rupee bribe in lieu of a dead mouse, and pay huge sums to the public.When Janta kills five mice, she becomes the only one to present physical evidence, and is ridiculed and given the runaround by officials. When she approaches Gangaram, he refuses to discuss this issue with her.When Bhajneesh launches a protest over the alleged killing of mice, as they are linked to Bhagwan Shri Ganesh, Gangaram meets with him, presents him with a solid gold 400 kilo mouse, and assures him that the rodents will not be killed, and those caught killing them will be arrested.Unaware of the changed circumstances, and still demanding compensation, Janta is arrested by the Police for killing five mice.Gangaram then makes a deal with a Caucasian male named Double Dealer - which involves fictitious export and import of dogs and cats.When pressure mounts on him to address issues such as removal of poverty, he enlists the assistance of Bhajneesh, who, for a huge fee, recruits several hundred employees to destroy shanty huts, and build multi-storeyed buildings.When corruption increases tenfold, and pressure mounts on him again, Gangaram decides to blame everything on external forces, especially Jan Gan's neighboring country, Andher Nagri.He visits it's emperor, and after some discussions, both verbally agree that in order to distract their respective electorate, it would be in both their interests to wage war on each other.In this way, both countries go to war.When Gopal protests and conspires to overthrow Gangaram, Deshpal kills him, and calls it a suicide. But not before Gopal finds out that no one in Parliament really wants to address burning issues as poverty, hunger, housing, employment, and corruption.Bhikharimal then approaches the Courts to declare Gangaram's election null and void.As soon as the Court issues the verdict against him, Gangaram declares an Emergency, has all opposition members arrested, and curbs the freedom of the media and the Courts.When Meera opposes him, he kills her, and is now all set to declare himself the permanent President of this beleaguered nation."

Yu begins gathering intelligence on a coup plot by rightist South Korean general Sin Jae-sin.Lee helps him pass back this information to North Korea using his unwitting friend Kim Su-gyong as a courier. Lee is suspected by a US counter intelligence agent Martin who found Lee takes care of homeless kids. Soon after, Lee is killed in a shootout with CIC agents, including Kim Soon-hee, leaving Yu unable to pass his crucial intelligence back to his government.

Colonel Klaus hears about a North Korean spy disguised as a veteran, and begins reviewing video tapes to check on Yu's activities.Kim saves the day by cutting the scenes out of the tapes to avoid further suspicion falling on Yu, but the disappearance of the scenes triggers Klaus' suspicion towards Kim herself. Klaus stages a test of loyalty for her, in which she is kidnapped and threatened with execution by American agents in Hokkaido, Japan pretending to be Communists; however, Kim correctly senses this is a trap, and escapes by killing the agents.Park Mu realizes that Yu and Kim are spies.

A lonely, mother-dominated man becomes obsessed by a beautiful young tenant in his mother's boarding house. When the object of his desire accidentally drowns in her bathtub, he hides her body in his room, resorting to murderous measures to keep anybody from discovering his ""bride.""—Erich Mees Karen (Beverly Ross) leaves her home on a farm with her boyfriend Rodney (Tommy McFadden) in order to take a college course on creative writing. She rents a room in a big old house from an elderly woman named Mrs. Brewer (Belle Mitchell), who has only one other tenant: Grahame (Laszlo Papas), a withdrawn young man who immediately becomes fascinated with Karen. After she moves into the house, Grahame spies on her through peepholes in the walls and a two-way mirror in her bathroom, becoming more and more obsessed with her.Grahame's life has been full of great sadness and isolation, and we see bits and pieces of his inner thought life and remembrances of being abandoned in an institution as a young boy by his adoptive parents (after being sexually abused by his adoptive father), ostracized during his military career, and rejected when he makes an attempt to reconnect with his family. His life with Mrs. Brewer is the only stability he has, and she constantly has him at her beck and call.Things take a turn for the worst when Karen suffers a seizure while she's taking a bath and drowns. Grahame is too late to save her, but he also decides not to tell anybody she died, keeping her body in his room and sleeping with it in his bed. As Grahame loses his grip on reality, he starts to go further and further over the edge into madness, murdering anybody who threatens to uncover his secret.The first to die is Chuck (Rigg Kennedy), a classmate of Karen's who comes looking for her. After he gets too inquisitive and threatens to go to the police, Grahame lures him into his bedroom under the pretense of seeing Karen, but Chuck finds her corpse in Grahame's bed instead. Before he can react, Grahame stabs him to death and hides the body in his bathtub. Mrs. Brewer is next; after sending Grahame all over the house looking for whatever could be causing the foul smell in the air, she manages to get upstairs while Grahame is away and discovers Karen's body, now dressed in a wedding gown. She is unable to keep the discovery a secret from Grahame, who then strangles her to death. Now totally delusional after killing Mrs. Brewer, Grahame keeps her corpse as well, propping it up in bed and having conversations with it as if she were still alive.Grahame's secret life comes to an end later that day after one of Mrs. Brewer's friends, Mrs. Dobson, comes to the house and discovers the bodies. Grahame attempts to attack her with a hammer, but she is saved when Rodney rushes in and subdues Grahame. The last scene of the film shows Grahame in a mental institution. Still desperate for companionship and acceptance, he smuggles an insect inside the hospital, presumably to keep in his cell, but he discovers he has accidentally killed it. The final image is of Grahame reacting to this in an anguished silent scream."

Vote for Gundisalvo,1978,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076896/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Spanish political satire. During the Spanish transition to democracy, a new political party was founded: Democratic Concord of the Spanish State. Its creators will choose a famous businessman as a candidate for the Senate, but not before resorting to the services of an efficient consultant in charge of washing his image and his past: Gundisalvo has just been born.—jsanchez In the early democracy, a still-not-legalized political party, Democratic Concord of the Spanish State, chooses Gundisalvo García as their candidate to the Senate. Gundisalvo is a rich construction businessman, and the party convinces him to pay the expenses of the campaign, because, they say, Concord does not accept donations from external sources or ""the capital"" (or more likely those are not offered). The party has a ""broad spectrum policy"", meaning they are not committing with anyone, pretending to take the best from each option - so Gundisalvo will claim to oppose divorce or to promote it, depending on his audience. The party sends him a campaign manager, Julio Pedraza, who turns Gundisalvo's family, friends and service into a political staff and changes their lifestyles to give Gundisalvo a more likable public image, training them on how to behave (and changing Gundisalvo's diet and routines). Pedraza, always the trickster, takes a rabble-rouser, an unpaid employee of Gundisalvo who threatens with a strike, and hires him as his assistant with a better salary, much to the chagrin of Gundisalvo's ""financial manager"" and best friend Olegario Matallana. His political enemy is conservative Aníbal Ocaña of Approved Democratic Coalition, who spies on Gundisalvo and tricks his wife to give him old photos that prove that Gundisalvo supported the dictatorship, even if his campaign claims otherwise. Ocaña's teams also obtain photos of Gundisalvo with his long-term lover Lolita; but Pedraza deflects the harm by tricking Ocaña to have a one-night stand *with the same woman*, obviously with Gundisalvo and Lolita being very reluctant; this is successful, managing to keep Gundisalvo's wife in the dark (and Pedraza keeps Gundisalvo in the dark while also enjoying Lolita's charms, as Gundisalvo's goddaughter's Lupe is uninterested in him). The campaigns and counter-campaigns are a succession of dirty tricks, like Pedraza scheduling a strip-tease at the same time Ocaña has his important meeting with an international guest - the audience would rather see the stripper. But when the stripper cancels, Pedraza insists that Lupe covers for her (hiding it from Lupe's father, Olegario), using the campaign's hymn because that's the only tape they have. Gundisalvo's speeches leave him hoarse just when Olegario discovers what he made his daughter do, and before another speech that is solved using a playback style - but of course with the wrong tapes. The stress causes Gundisalvo to be sick just on the election day; Pedraza fills him with medicines and takes him to the stalls (where they coincide with Ocaña, who angrily gives him the ""cuckold"" sign; Gundisalvo's wife is convinced that his enemies are smearing *her* reputation). Instead of voting, Gundisalvo behaves crazily, chanting consigns, proselytizing and buying votes in the polling station, and the police arrests him - but when the policemen see that's the man in the campaign posters, they understand they're in for a bad time. The story the ends with a caption saying that Gundisalvo was elected senator, comparing that with Churchill's quote ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others"" - then, the policeman's voice is repeated: ""We're in for a bad time."""
