Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1890s Wyoming, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid lead a band of outlaws. When a train robbery goes wrong, they find themselves on the run with a posse hard on their heels. After considering their options, they escape to South America. Butch and Sundance are the two leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Butch is all ideas, Sundance is all action and skill. The West is becoming civilized, and when Butch and Sundance rob a train once too often, a special posse begins trailing them no matter where they run. Over rocks, through towns, across rivers, the group is always just behind them. When they finally escape through sheer luck, Butch has another idea, ""Let's go to Bolivia"". Based on the exploits of the historical characters.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In the turn-of-the-century American West, Robert LeRoy Parker and Harry Longabaugh are better known by their aliases: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Partners and arguably the most renowned outlaws in the area, they hold up banks or trains. Within the partnership, Butch is the brains, Sundance the shooting brawn. Despite their outlaw status, they are seen as an affable duo by those who know them, and even by many of their so-called adversaries. Butch has compiled the Hole in the Wall Gang, named after his hideout in the Wyoming mountains, and is its de facto leader, primarily because he was the one who brought them all together. But as time goes on, Butch and Sundance discover that changing circumstances are making their work more and more difficult, which leads to others within the gang questioning Butch's leadership. Following one of the gang's jobs holding up a train, a posse of six men on horseback are after them, not the gang as a whole, but rather only Butch and Sundance. The duo have to figure who the six men are to find out their end goal. In trying to get away, they are assisted by their friend, schoolteacher Etta Place, who is officially Sundance's girlfriend. She ended up with Sundance instead of Butch only because the two of them saw each other first. Butch and Sundance learn how far the posse will go to get what they were tasked to do, and also how far they themselves will go to preserve their lifestyle--and their lives.—Huggo The true story of fast draws and wild rides, battles with posses, train and bank robberies, a torrid love affair, and a new lease on outlaw life in far away Bolivia. It is also a character study of a remarkable friendship between Butch, possibly the most likeable outlaw in frontier history, and his closest associate, the fabled, ever-dangerous Sundance Kid.—Jwelch5742 In 1899 Wyoming, Butch Cassidy, the intelligent leader of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, and his taciturn and deadly friend the Sundance Kid plundered trains and banks for a living. However, with renowned Indian tracker Lord Baltimore and the lethal posse of the relentless lawman Joe Lefors hot on their trail after a botched attempt to rob a train, the criminal duo ends up in far-off Bolivia to pick up where they left off. What does the future hold for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid?—Nick Riganas Wyoming, c. 1900s. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), the leaders of the famous Hole in the Wall Gang, are planning another bank robbery. As they return to their hideout in Hole-in-the-Wall, they find out that the gang has selected a new leader, Harvey Logan. He challenges Butch to a knife fight, which Butch wins, using a ruse. Logan had the idea to rob the Union Pacific Flyer train instead of banks. He wanted to rob it twice, the idea being that the return would be considered safe and therefore more money might be involved. Butch takes this idea as his own.The first robbery goes very well and the Marshal of the next town can't manage to raise a posse. Butch and Sundance listen to his attempts, enjoying themselves. Sundance's lover, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), is introduced. But obviously both men vie for her attention as she also goes bike-riding with Butch, a dialogue-free part of the film, accompanied by ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.""The second robbery goes wrong. Not only does Butch use too much dynamite to blow the safe, but also a second train arrives, which is carrying a posse of six heavily armed men on horseback that has been specially outfitted to hunt down Butch and Sundance. The gang flees, but the entire posse follows Butch and Sundance. They try hiding in a brothel in a nearby town that night, but are betrayed. When they discover that the posse is continuing to follow their trail, they try riding double on a single horse in the hope that the posse will split up, but that fails. They then arrive in a nearby town and try to arrange an amnesty with the help of a friendly sheriff (Jeff Corey) of Carbon County. But the sheriff tells them they have no chance of getting one, and that they will be hunted down until they are killed by the posse.Still on the run the next day, they muse about the identities of their pursuers. They fixate on Lord Baltimore, a famous Indian tracker, and Joe Lefors, a tough, renowned lawman, identifiable by his white skimmer hat (which the lead posse member is wearing). After climbing some mountains, they suddenly find themselves trapped on the edge of a canyon. With their unseen pursuers on their tail, they decide to jump into the river far below, even though Sundance can't swim and would prefer to fight.Later that day, they arrive at Etta's house and learn from the local newspapers all about the posse and the identities of their pursuers and that they have been paid to stay together until they kill Butch and the Kid. They decide that it's time to leave the country: destination Bolivia!After a montage of showing Butch, Sundance and Etta on their travels to New York, they arrive in a small Bolivian village at the end of the world. Sundance already resents their choice. Their first attempted bank robbery fails before it gets off the ground, since they are unable to speak or understand Spanish. Etta teaches them the words they need. The following robbery is clumsily executed, as Butch still needs his crib sheet. At each succeeding robbery they appear to improve, until they are sought by the authorities all over Bolivia.However their confidence drops one evening, as Butch, Sundance and Etta are having dinner at a fancy restaurant in a nearby town, when they see a man wearing a white straw hat standing on the other side of the street talking to a few men. Fearing that Lefors is once again after them, Butch suggests going straight, so as not to attract Lefors' attention.They get their first honest job as payroll guards in a mine, directed by an American named Garris (Strother Martin). However, on their first working day, they are attacked by highwaymen. Garris is killed and Butch and Sundance are forced to kill the Bolivian robbers. Ironically, Butch had never killed a man in his entire criminal career, but while they are attempting to go straight, he is forced to kill the bandits. Since they seem unable to escape violence, regardless of their occupation, they decide to return to robbery. That evening, Etta decides to leave them as she senses that their days are numbered and she doesn't want to watch them die.A few days later, Butch and Sundance attack a payroll mule train in the jungle, taking the money and the mule. When they arrive in the nearest town, San Vicente, a stable boy recognizes the brand on the mule's backside and alerts the local police. While Butch and Sundance are eating at a local eatery, the police arrive and a climactic gun battle begins.The two of them manage to find shelter in an empty house, but they're soon low on ammunition. Butch makes a run to the mule to fetch the rest of the ammunition while Sundance covers him, shooting several Bolivian policemen. But even the ""fastest gun in the West"" cannot match the twenty or more Bolivian policemen at once. Butch manages to retrieve the ammunition and runs back to the house, but they are both wounded. While tending to their wounds in the house, about 100 soldiers of the Bolivian cavalry arrive and surround the place, eager to get at the notorious 'Bandidos Yanquis'.The wounded pair discuss where they will be going next, realizing that their time is up (Butch suggests Australia, where at least they speak English). They dash out of the house in a futile attempt to get to their horses. The image freezes and slowly turns to a sepia tone tintype while a voice is heard ordering: ""Fuego!"" (Fire), followed by the sound of hundreds of rifles being fired in three consecutive volleys...."

Soon Joe is broke and homeless without client or money, and when he meets Ratso on the streets again, Ratso invites Joe to move into his apartment in a derelict building. Ratso has a strange cough and as his health worsens he dreams of moving to Florida where he believes he'll recover. Joe decides to accompany his friend to Florida as soon as he gets the necessary money.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Attired in urban cowboy garb, Joe Buck is a naive Texas hayseed newly arrived in New York City to make it big as a gigolo, solely to his preferred clientele of rich, attractive women. His belief in his appeal to the female persuasion has been reinforced his entire life by every female he has ever encountered: family, friends, and lovers past and present. But life in New York City disappoints: he's out-hustled by most of the people he meets, and he lacks the fortitude to hustle them right back to get what was originally due to him. With nowhere to turn, he eventually befriends one of those hustlers: Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, a sickly man with a gimp leg. Some call him Ratzo, a nickname he dislikes. Joe ends up squatting with Ratso in a room he has found in a condemned, thus otherwise-empty building. As they lean on each other for support, they work together for their mutual benefit and survival. But as Ratso's health deteriorates over the winter, Joe changes his focus to achieving Ratso's dream of moving to Miami.—Huggo When Joe Buck (Voight), a good-looking, naively charming Texas 'cowboy' makes his way to the Big Apple to seek his fortune, the only wealth he finds is in the friendship of Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman), a sleazy, small-time con man with big dreams. Living on the tattered fringe of society, these two outcasts develop an unlikely bond, one that transcends their broken dreams. As the film opens, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), a young Texan working as a dishwasher, dresses in new cowboy clothing, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute for women. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money.Joe then meets Enrico Salvatore ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a street con man with a limp who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper (John McGiver).

Ratso offers to share the apartment in which he is squatting in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a ""business relationship"" as hustlers.

His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, though his grandmother frequently neglects him as well. He also has a tragic relationship with Annie, a local girl. Ratso's back story comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner, who worked in a subway station.

Easy Rider,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two bikers head from L.A. to New Orleans through the open country and desert lands, and along the way they meet a man who bridges a counter-culture gap of which they had been unaware. Netting a hefty profit from their latest drug deal, hippies Wyatt and Billy decide to outfit themselves with among other things motorbikes - Wyatt complete in what they call his Captain America gear and similar motif on the bike - and chucking any structure in their lives beyond the want to get there for the event, cycle from their home base of Los Angeles to New Orleans for Mardi Gras in just over a week. They don't plan to spend their proceeds on this trip - they saving that for a more carefree life in Florida after the fact - they sleeping in the great outdoors along the way. While Wyatt is more easy going, believing in the karmic nature and practicality of helping others when they can and in turn asking for help when they need it, Billy is a little more suspicious of the people they encounter, especially in hiding their wad of cash that is stuffed into the gas tank of Wyatt's bike, that money their future. They will find that not all counter-culturalists have the exact same mindset, while they will also find the spiritual and practical connections to others in perhaps the most unlikely of places and people. But they will also ruffle some feathers just for being hippies, arguably in the fear not of them as people but what they represent. Through it all, Wyatt in particular evaluates if the trip ends up being what he expects or wants for his life.—Huggo In search of enlightenment, freedom, and, above all, an unattainable America, the pair of best friends and free-spirited hippies--Wyatt, aka Captain America, and Billy--set off on a long journey from Los Angeles to New Orleans after completing a lucrative cocaine deal. In high hopes of making it in time for Mardi Gras, the duo of motorcycle rebels zoom through the quiet United States heartland in their chromed custom-made Harley Davidson chopper bikes, as a vibrant tapestry of diverse people--friends and foes--and unparalleled landscapes unfold. Before the endless stretches of road and against the backdrop of the tireless motors' deep rumbling, Wyatt and Billy keep riding on, looking for that so-called independence, even though malicious animosity and senseless violence get in the way. Can the two easy riders beat the system and sail into the sunset?—Nick Riganas Two young ""hippie"" bikers, Wyatt and Billy, sell some dope in Southern California, stash their money away in their gas-tank, and set off for a trip across America on their own personal odyssey looking for a way to lead their lives. On the journey they encounter bigotry and hatred from small-town communities who despise and fear their non-conformism. However Wyatt and Billy also discover people attempting 'alternative lifestyles' who are resisting this narrow-mindedness, there is always a question mark over the future survival of these drop-out groups. The gentle hippie community who thank God for 'a place to stand' are living their own unreal dream. The rancher they encounter and his Mexican wife are hard-pushed to make ends meet. Even LSD turns sour on a bad trip. Death seems like the only freedom. When they arrive at a diner in a small town, they are insulted by the local rednecks as weirdo degenerates. They are arrested on some minor pretext by the local sheriff and thrown in jail where they meet George Hanson, a liberal alcoholic lawyer. He gets them out and decides to join them on their trip to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.—alfiehitchie Partners and friends Wyatt and Billy buy drugs in Mexico and sell them in Los Angeles, raising money to travel to the Mardi Grass in New Orleans on their chopper-style bikes. They cross the country on a musical ride through spectacular landscapes and encounter counterculture groups and experience small-town intolerance for their looks and lifestyle.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The protagonists are two freewheeling hippies: Wyatt, nicknamed ""Captain America"" (Peter Fonda), and Billy (Dennis Hopper). Their names are a reference to Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid. Wyatt dresses in American flag-adorned leather, while Billy dresses in Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts and a bush hat. Wyatt is appreciative of the help they receive and of others along the way while the Billy is often hostile, unappreciative and paranoid.After smuggling drugs from Mexico to Los Angeles, Wyatt and Billy sell their drugs to ""Connection,"" a man (Phil Spector) in a Rolls Royce. With the money from the sale stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars & Stripes-adorned fuel tank of Wyatt's California-style chopper, they ride eastward in an attempt to reach New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras. At nights, they are forced to camp out in the fields, as no motel will lodge them due to their hippie and biker appearance.During their trip, Wyatt and Billy meet and have a meal with a rancher, whom Wyatt admires for his simple, traditional farming lifestyle. Later, the duo pick up a hitchhiker (Luke Askew) and agree to take him to his commune, where they stay for a day. Life in the commune appears hard, with naive city hippies finding it difficult to grow their own crops in a dry climate with poor soil. (One of the children in the commune is played by Fonda's four-year-old daughter, Bridget.) At one point, the bikers witness a prayer for blessing of the new crop, as put by one of the members: A chance ""to make a stand,"" and to plant ""simple food, for our simple taste."" The commune also contains a traveling theater group that ""sings for its supper"" (performs for food). Free love is practiced and two women turn their attention to Wyatt and Billy. As the bikers leave, the hitchhiker (known only as ""stranger on highway"" in the credits) gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with ""the right people"".While jokingly riding along with a parade in a small town, the pair are arrested by the local authorities for ""parading without a permit"" and thrown in jail, where they befriend ACLU lawyer and local drunk George Hanson (Jack Nicholson), who helps them get out of jail and decides to go with them to New Orleans for Marti Gras. George has a card for a whorehouse in New Orleans but states he has attempted to go in the past but never made it past the county line. As they camp that night, Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana. As an alcoholic and a ""square"", George is reluctant to try it (""It leads to harder stuff"", and ""I don't want to get hooked""), but finally relents.While attempting to eat in a rural Louisiana restaurant, the trio's hippie appearance attracts the attention of the redneck locals. However, a group of teenage girls are interested in the strangers and their appearance and want to meet and get a ride, the local men including the sheriff make mocking, racist, and homophobic remarks. One of them menacingly states, ""I don't believe they'll make the parish line."" Wyatt, Billy, and George leave without eating and make camp outside of town. The events of the day cause George to comment, ""This used to be a hell of a good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it."" He observes that Americans talk a lot about the value of freedom, but are actually afraid of anyone who truly exhibits it.In the middle of the night, the local rednecks attack and brutally beat the trio with baseball bats while they're sleeping. Billy manages to scare the attackers off by pulling a switchblade on them. Wyatt and Billy suffer minor injuries, but George is killed. Wyatt and Billy wrap George's body up in his sleeping bag, gather his belongings, and vow to return the items to his parents.Wyatt and Bill continue on and finally arrive in New Orleans and find the brothel George had intended to visit. Taking prostitutes Karen (Karen Black) and Mary (Toni Basil) with them, Wyatt and Billy go outdoors and wander the parade-filled street of the Mardi Gras celebration. They end up in a cemetery, where all four ingest LSD. They experience a psychedelic bad trip infused with Catholic prayer, represented through quick edits, sound effects, and over-exposed film.Making camp afterward, Billy thinks they have made it and will retire rich in Florida but Wyatt declares, ""We blew it."" Billy doesn't know what he is talking about.The next morning, the two continue on their trip to Florida. While on a quiet local road somewhere in Alabama, two inbred-looking rednecks in a pickup spot them riding along and decide to ""scare the hell out of them"" with their shotgun. As they pull up alongside Billy who is behind Wyatt, one of them lazily aims the shotgun at him and taunts him, asking, ""Want me to blow your brains out?"" and ""Why don't you get a haircut?"" When Billy gives them the finger, the hillbilly fires the gun at Billy, who immediately crashes and is seriously wounded. As the truck roars off down the road past Wyatt, he races back to his fatally injured friend, who's covered in blood, and covers him with his flag adorned jacket before riding off for help. But the pickup truck has turned around and closes in on Wyatt as the rednecks don't want witnesses. The redneck fires at Wyatt as they pass him, the bike breaks apart and the bike's gas tank erupts into a fiery explosion. Wyatt is thrown off his bike and lands by the side of the road... dead.As the murderous country boys drive away, the film ends with an aerial shot of the flaming bike and the body on the deserted road, as the camera ascends to the sky. The duo's journey has ended."

They begin an affair, which brings more differences to the surface.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Neil Klugman works in the public library and lives in New York with his Jewish aunt, rather than in Arizona with his parents. College-girl Brenda Patimkin very much lives with her well-to-do Jewish family. The two are attracted and start seeing each other. As the relationship gets more serious, Brenda's mother gets increasingly hostile to Neil.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} OK, Ill give it a whirl: Working-class background city Jew Neil Klugman meets suburban Jewish Ivy Leaguer Brenda Patimkin while a guest at Brendas country club. They begin a steamy romance, heavily disapproved of by the Patimkins, particularly Brendas cold, snobby mother.Stuck without a place to live for the remainder of the summer, Brenda invites Neil to move into her familys home at the height of planning for Brendas brothers upcoming wedding, causing Brenda's mother to go ballistic.Brenda is highly conflicted about her relationship with her parents and her upper-class background. In one scene, she accuses her family of tiptoeing around each other, never really communicating; in a later scene, when Neil tries to caution her about birth control, she childishly resists but ultimately acquiesces and gets a diaphragm.The diaphragm turns out to be her downfall, as her mother finds it in a drawer and pulls a heavy guilt-trip on her, letting her know that she has let them down in the most disgraceful way possible.When Neil shows up at Radcliffe for a visit, Brenda tearfully shows him her parents letters that essentially disown her for her sin of 1) dating a man beneath her class and 2) having sex with him. Realizing that underneath her saucy veneer, Brenda is actually heavily dependent upon her parents approval, he walks out the door and leaves her crying, alone."

And after saving vulnerable Countess Tracy di Vicenzo from certain death, Bond infiltrates Blofeld's heavily-fortified alpine headquarters, from where the evil genius plans to launch his mad secret scheme and imperil millions of innocents. But as Bond dices with death at the impregnable mountaintop stronghold, something unexpected happens.

He intends to get information on Blofeld's whereabouts, and the trail eventually leads to a remote alpine institute in Switzerland. Blofeld's not easy to kill, and he has ways of dealing with people who cross him.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> The film opens with Miss Moneypenny and M at MI6 headquarters in London, under the shell corporation known as 'Universal Exports', discussing the whereabouts of MI6's best ""00"" agent, James Bond. Bond happens to be driving on a country coastal road in Portugal in his Aston-Martin when he's passed by a woman driving a Mercury Cougar. The woman drives to a nearby beach and tries to drown herself in the surf. When Bond drags her back, he is attacked by several thugs, whom he is able to beat in hand-to-hand combat. When he turns his attention back to the mysterious woman, he sees her driving off in her Cougar. Bond, puzzled by the turn of events, says ""This never happened to the other fellow!"", (presumably a reference to the departure of Sean Connery from the series).Later, at a casino, the same woman Bond found on the beach, Contessa Teresa ""Tracy"" di Vicenzo, is gambling and finds herself unable to pay her debt. Bond pays the tab for her and she invites him to her room to ""repay"" him. Bond is again attacked by another man, whom he beats. When he returns to his own room, Tracy is there waiting, steals Bond's pistol and threatens to kill him ""for a thrill"". Bond disarms her and demands to know about the man in her room; Tracy has no answer. Tracy leaves the hotel the next morning and when James tries to trail her, he is apprehended by several more men who take him to Tracy's father, Marc-Ange Draco, head of a powerful European crime organization which is called Union Course. The gangster offers Bond a sizable dowry if he'll marry his troubled daughter after he tells Bond about Tracy's suicial depression since her mother's death. Bond turns down the offer but agrees to continue dating Tracy if Draco will help him find SPECTRE's sinister leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, whom Bond has been unsuccessfully tracking for the past two years.When he returns to MI6 in London, M tells Bond that his obsession with finding Blofeld must end. Bitter, James gives Miss Moneypenny his resignation and cleans out his office. Moneypenny, however, subverts Bond's wishes and enters a request for two weeks leave, a change both James and M realize is for the better.Now able to pursue Blofeld on his own time, James first goes back to Portugal for a birthday party being thrown for Draco. While there, Tracy reveals that she knows about the deal her father struck with Bond; she does not want to be used this way and demands her father help Bond. Draco relents and tells Bond to check out a lead in Bern, Switzerland. Tracy and Bond officially begin their courtship.In Bern, Bond infiltrates the law firm of a man named Gebruder Gumbol and finds letters from Blofeld to the London College of Arms. Returning to London and meeting with an expert at the College (who shows the agent the Bond family coat-of-arms) he informs Bond that Blofeld is attempting to claim the title of the Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp of Switzerland. Bond assumes the identity of an Arms delegate, Sir Hilary Bray, to investigate further. When he reports to M with his new leads, he is given permission to take up the case once again.Acting as Bray, Bond travels back to Switzerland to Blofeld's latest compound at the top of Piz Gloria, a peak in the Swiss Alps. The location is accessible only by cable car or helicopter. There he finds Blofeld who has taken up the identity of an epidemiologist who specializes in allergy research. Bond finds that Blofeld's guests are about 10 beautiful women, all allergy sufferers, whose illnesses have allegedly been cured. Though he is essentially imprisoned in his room at night, Bond figures a way to open the door and goes to the room of a woman, named Ruby, who surreptitiously gave him the number. When James strips naked Ruby is overjoyed and the two make love.While they lay together a strange light and sound treatment begins over the bed and the woman appears hypnotized. Blofeld's ""treatment"" involves cassette tapes that induce hypnotism. Bond leaves her room, returning to his own where he finds another one of the women, named Nancy, waiting. He seduces her as well. Bond later sneaks up on a meeting involving the girls; they are given Christmas presents that contain a communication device and a specialized deadly virus that each girl will release in a different region of the world unless Blofeld's demands are met that the United States gives him a pardon and recognizes him as a count.The next day Bond's cover is blown by Blofeld's assistant, Irma Bunt, when he sneaks out of his room to go into Ruby's room and finds Irma there. Bond is taken to Blofeld who identifies him (after Bond made a slip earlier to Blofeld that the real Bray wouldn't have made) and imprisons him in the cold gear room of the compound's cable-car. Bond is able to escape the room and steals a skiing uniform and skis rapidly down the mountain as Blofeld and several of his men give chase. Bond arrives in the village of Muren and meets Tracy and the two escape Bunt and several of Blofeld's henchmen in her car when they drive through a car race. Bond and Tracy find a secluded barn to hold up for the night; Bond proposes to Tracy and she accepts, but will not allow him to sleep together with her. She relents when Bond pulls her into his own bedding.In the morning, Tracy and Bond ski away from the barn, with Blofeld and a few of his men close behind. When it seems like Bond and Tracy will escape, Blofeld causes an avalanche that they are unable to stay ahead of and are buried. Blofeld has his men retrieve Tracy and leave Bond for dead. Bond returns to London, seeking a way to rescue Tracy and stop Blofeld's plan. M refuses to launch an assault on Piz Gloria for diplomatic reasons. Bond instead enlists the help of Draco, who provides helicopters and a strike team from Union Course, all on the pretense of a short-notice demolition job.At the Piz Gloria, Blofeld keeps Tracy in his company and even proposes to her. Just then, Bond, Draco and their men attack the Piz Gloria and stop Blofeld from sending his orders to the women. Bond rescues Tracy and she flies off with her father. Bond finds Blofeld escaping in a bobsled and chases him in a second one, catching up and boarding Blofeld's sled. They tussle briefly until Bond is able to hold Blofeld up to catch a forked tree branch, leaving him there injured and unconscious. Bond gains control of the sled and stops it.A lavish wedding is thrown for Bond and Tracy and they are married. After the reception, Bond leaves with Tracy in his Aston-Martin. They travel a few miles and Bond stops to remove some of the flower chains decorating their car. Tracy reflects that Bond has given her more than a husband, she now has a future. Suddenly, a car driven by a very-much alive Blofeld (now wearing a neck brace) races by and Irma Bunt opens fire on Bond's car with an assault rifle. Bond survives the drive-by attack by ducking behind the car and recognizes Blofeld immediately and jumps back in the car with Tracy to give chase, but Tracy is dead; hit in the head by a bullet that went through the windshield killing her instantly. As Bond holds her, a policeman stops by after hearing the shooting. Bond tells him that there's ""no hurry"" and that they ""have all the time in the world."" On that sad note, 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' comes to a close."

His first attempt gets destroyed by a heavy wind before he even gets off the porch. His second attempt manages to get aloft, but not before dragging him everywhere, before the kite crashes to the ground. Angered at his kite, he thrusts it at Lucy, saying 'anyone who can fly this kite is a genius.'

While Charlie laments about his losing streak, Linus tries to put a positive spin on it. ""We learn more from losing, than we do from winning,"" he replies. ""I guess that makes me the smartest person in the whole world,"" says Charlie, being sarcastic. This causes Linus to admit that if Charlie Brown stays positive, he'll win one of these days.

Lucy ends up showing Charlie's many faults in a slideshow. The experience makes him nauseous, and he begs for the 'therapy' to stop.

Linus claims the kids at school missed him, but Charlie says he isn't going back to school.

The world does seem to be going on just as normal. In a clearing, Charlie notices Lucy, sitting around with a football. As she seems to put it in a placekick position, he attempts to sneak up behind her and kick it, but she pulls it away from him at the last second, sending him sprawling on the ground.As he lays there, she comes up to him and welcomes him home."

While recovering from a suicide attempt, she gets the idea from a movie magazine to head for Hollywood to make it as an actress. Robert is a desperate Hollywood citizen trying to become a director, never doubting he'll make it. Robert and Gloria meet and decide to enter a dance marathon, one of the crazes of the 1930's. The grueling dancing takes its toll on Gloria's already weakened spirit, and she tells Robert that she'd be better off dead, that her life is hopeless - all the while acting cruelly and bitterly, alienating those around her, trying to convince him to shoot her and put her out of her misery. After all, they shoot horses, don't they?—alfiehitchie In 1932, in the Great Depression, a group of hopeless people participates of a dance marathon contest on the Santa Monica Pier in California. Among them are the bitter and disillusioned Gloria; a sailor that fought in the war; the aspirant actress and actor Alice and Joel; the farmer James and his pregnant wife Ruby; all of them expecting to win the award of US$ 1,500.00.

However, the Master of Ceremony Rocky summons the stranger Robert (Michael Sarrazin) to replace her partner and dance with Gloria.

Rocky, however, will do anything for publicity and initiates a series of grueling derbies.—Jwelch5742 A young boy by the name of Robert sees his hillbilly father shoot a horse with a broken leg to put it out of its misery.Years later, it's the Great Depression, the 1930's. Robert dreamed of being a great filmmaker but is now almost broke. He decides to enter a Los Angeles dance marathon, a craze that many people are falling into in California with the promise of winning cash. It is there that he meets his first dance partner, a beautiful but caustic and bitter woman named Gloria, apparently recovering from a suicide attempt. For her, after years of bad luck with men and no money herself, the dance competition offers her false happiness. Together, she and Robert form a friendship.As the competition goes on, it becomes evident that the show host, Rocky, doesn't have much money himself and, despite showing genuine remorse about it, he frequently exploits and psychologically abuses the dancers and makes a spectacle out of them for the viewers of the show, who pay him a great deal of money every day just to get into the arena. Alice, an aspiring actress, goes into hysterics when her beloved dress is stolen, and a man's leg becomes paralyzed. When he falls unconscious, he is given castor oil and doused in ice water, and then forced to dance again. A pregnant woman dances and has to race with her husband around a track, often becoming exhausted and collapsing.Gloria becomes frustrated and snaps at Robert, jealous of the attention he gives to Alice, who bears a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe. When Robert discovers that Rocky is the one who stole and ripped up Alice's dress, he questions him, but Rocky tells him that it's just show business, and that the spectators want to see the dancers as miserable as they themselves feel because of the Depression.During a repeated, timed race around a track, Gloria's new dance partner, an elderly sailor, has a heart attack and dies, which Rocky cheerfully covers up from the audience. Upon seeing his death, Alice has a mental breakdown, losing her mind and hiding in the shower. Rocky, having seen similar breakdowns time and time again in his business, hugs her and then walks her to the nurses on duty, where she will presumably have to be sent away to psychiatric care.When Robert and Gloria partner up again, Rocky suggests that they marry each other as a publicity stunt for the show, trying to bribe Gloria with tons of free wedding gifts. He then lets it slip that even if Gloria and Robert do win the dance competition, they'll have to pay hidden expenses and will be left with next to nothing in cash, and he cautions her to get out while she can with her dignity still intact. She and Robert leave and, both nearly penniless and dejected, they walk down to the ocean at night, a place Robert has always adored but that now does nothing for him. Gloria repeatedly breaks down and cries, and reveals that it was never really the money or material items she was after, it was the promise of happiness, something she has been longing for but has now lost forever. At the end of her rope, she tries to shoot herself in the head but can't find the courage to pull the trigger, so she pleads for Robert to do it for her. Robert shoots her and is taken in by the police (meanwhile his misery at the death of his only friend is viewed by a circle of rubberneckers from the streets, despite the police trying to block off the death site). When a cop asks Robert why he did it, Robert says, ""she asked me to - they shoot horses, don't they?"" before he is locked up in jail.The film ends with a view of Rocky shouting out to the crowd at the dance competition, and the crowd is cheering and laughing, while the competing dancers look miserable and depressed."

Deke Thornton wants to capture Pike, his ""get-out-of-jail-free card"", and the gang of bounty-hunters want the reward money on the ""Bunch's"" heads. No one is innocent in this unflinching tale of desperation against changing times.—bcarruthers-76500 In the waning days of the wild Old West and on the eve of World War I--after a botched attempt to rob a railroad office in broad daylight--the ageing outlaw, Pike Bishop, and his renegade gang of five equally dangerous criminals head to Mexico. With Bishop's former friend, Deke Thornton, and his posse of mercenaries hot on their trail, Pike and his men decide to do one daring last job: hijack a U.S. ammunition train to supply the megalomaniac General Mapache's revolutionary army. However, before long, this uneasy alliance will pave the way for a suicidal showdown, as loyalties are put to the test. Is there a future for Pike's Wild Bunch?—Nick Riganas A few months before World War I, an aging band of outlaws led by Pike Bishop rob a Texas railroad office intent on using the money to retire. When the robbery goes wrong, the gang is forced to flee to Mexico with Pike's reformed ex-partner, Deke Thornton, in hot pursuit. With nothing to show for the failed robbery, Pike's gang agrees to steal a shipment of guns for General Mapache to restore their fortunes. With Thornton closing in, and their association with the evil Juerta trying their conscience, Pike and his gang prepare for their lawless past to catch up with them.—Ronos The movie takes place in 1913, during the height of the Mexican Revolution. In the fictional south Texas town of Starbuck, the ""Wild Bunch"" - led by Pike Bishop (William Holden), and also including Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine), Lyle and Tector Gorch (Warren Oates and Ben Johnson), Angel (Jaime Sanchez), Buck (Rayford Barnes), and Clarence 'Crazy' Lee (Bo Hopkins), among others - enters the town, with half of them dressed as United States cavalry soldiers. They ride past a group of children who are torturing a pair of scorpions by putting them on a hill of red ants (this image was suggested by Emilio Fernandez; he said that he and his friends had done similar things as children), a very symbolic image which symbolizes the events of the film. The gang breaks into the railroad office and holds it up, but on the roof of the San Rafael hotel across the street is a ragtag posse of bounty hunters, led by Patrick Harrigan (Albert Dekker), a railroad detective, and Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), a former member of the gang being ambushed, along with scruffy bounty hunters Coffer (Strother Martin), T.C. (L.Q. Jones), Huey (Paul Harper), and Jess (stuntman Bill Hart).The gang's escape is interrupted by the local temperance union, which is holding a parade in the town, led by Reverend Wainscoat (Dub Taylor), playing ""Shall We Gather At The River?"" (a hymn used as a funeral song in innumerable John Ford Westerns, used here for ironic effect). Various members of the gang, inside and outside of the railroad office, spot the bounty hunters and Pike uses a railroad office worker as a decoy, throwing him out of the railroad office to draw the fire of the bounty hunters, allowing for the gang's escape.A vicious, confusing gunfight occurs, with gang members, bounty hunters, and civilians caught in the crossfire, resulting in numerous deaths. Only six members of the gang escape - Pike, Dutch, the Gorches, Angel, and Buck, who has been shot in the face and blinded - and the rest of the gang is killed. Crazy Lee is left behind to hold the railroad office patrons as hostages; when Harrigan and Thornton's gang descend from the roof of the hotel to scavenge from the various dead bodies, he is ultimately killed by Harrigan. Outside of town, Pike mercifully kills Buck, who is unable to continue riding due to his injuries.The surviving gang members arrive at a small Mexican town, where another gang member, the old Freddie Sykes (Edmond O'Brien), is waiting with horses and saddles. In this scene, they realize that the robbery was a set-up by the railroad - all of their earnings have been nothing but bags of steel washers. The excitable Gorches very nearly turn on Angel and Sykes, but they are held in check by Pike and Dutch. Later in the film, Sykes reveals to Pike that Crazy Lee - who had been deliberately left behind by Pike - was his grandson.We also learn as the film progresses that Thornton has been given his parole in exchange for his tracking down his old colleague Pike. Though Thornton continually disparages his posse as ""gutter trash"", he reluctantly continues his pursuit of the gang. Pike reveals through flashback (most of which were cut by the studio in the original version) how he abandoned Thornton to the railroad detectives, and also how he developed his painful leg wound (he had an affair with a Mexican woman (Aurora Clavell) and was shot by her husband), an injury that plagues him the rest of his life.Pike and his men return to Angel's village and remain there for a day and night. Pike learns from the village elder, Don Jose (Chano Urueta) that the village has been attacked by General Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), a Mexican general working for the government of General Huerta. Angel's father was hanged, and his girlfriend was taken by Mapache for his own. Though he tells Pike that he will not avenge his father, Angel remains obsessed with getting his vengeance on Mapache.The gang then heads to the small town of Agua Verde, Mapache's headquarters, to trade their horses. When they visit the General, Angel sees Teresa, his girlfriend, presenting a pony to Mapache. Angel shoots her in the arms of Mapache, nearly leading to a tense confrontation between the Mexicans and the gang, but Pike and Dutch defuse it. They are later hired by Mapache and his German military advisers to steal a US arms shipment for him, which they agree to for a price of ten thousand dollars - but Angel insists that they allow him to take a case of rifles to his village to protect them from Mapache. Pike and Dutch agree.The Bunch holds up the train, but Thornton and his posse are also on board. They pursue the Bunch to a bridge over the Rio Grande, with a squad of inept cavalrymen right behind them. After a confusing three-way shootout, the Bunch recrosses the border into Mexico. Thornton and his men are blown into the river when dynamite wired to the bridge by the Bunch explodes, and the gang makes their escape. After getting themselves back together, Thornton and his men pursue the gang into Mexico.Out on the trail toward Agua Verde, the Bunch find a Browning M1917 machine gun among the cache they stole. They are later met by a small group of Pancho Villa's men, friends of Angel. Angel's Mexican comrades silently sneak up on the Bunch after dark and hold them hostage for a few minutes until Angel can square things. Pike and Dutch seem quite impressed with the ability of the revolutionaries to get the drop on them, however the Gorches are angry that they'd been made to look like fools. The Mexicans leave as silently as they arrived.While waiting for word of the Bunch's robbery at a telegraph station, Mapache and his entourage are attacked by forces led by Pancho Villa and routed. Mapache sends one of his subordinates, Captain Herrera (Alfonso Arau), to meet the Bunch in a wide ravine with a large group of soldiers, but the confrontation nearly turns violent after a nervous Mexican soldier fires at the wagon holding the weapons. The Bunch has wired the wagon with dynamite, and Pike lights the fuse until Herrera defuses the situation by executing the soldier who has fired on the gang. When it seems like Herrera's men may open fire en masse, the Bunch reveals that they've assembled and loaded the M1917. Herrera realizes they're outgunned and retreats, also realizing the Bunch are willing to sacrifice themselves if Mapache reneges on their deal.The Bunch then hides their weapons haul - the fifteen cases of rifles, plus the M1917 - and gives it in installments to Mapache in exchange for their money. Unfortunately, when Angel and Dutch arrive in town, Mapache reveals that he has been tipped off by Teresa's father of Angel's perfidy -- for killing his daughter, the father revealed to Mapache that one of the cases of rifles was given to the rebels by Angel. Angel is captured by Mapache's men, and Dutch simply rides off, unable to rescue his comrade.The gang regroups at a canyon outside of town, waiting for Sykes to return with their pack horses, and they argue over what to do. Then they watch as Sykes is ambushed and seriously wounded by Thornton's posse. Pike decides to abandon his old friend, who is being pursued hotly by Thornton's men, and return to Agua Verde to retrieve Angel. Mapache refuses to turn over Angel, who has been badly tortured, and invites the gang to spend the night in town whoring and drinking.The next morning, Pike decides to make a final stand while looking over his last bottle of whiskey and the woman he'd spent the night with. The four gang members load up shotguns, rifles, and semi-automatic sidearms and march through Agua Verde to Mapache's headquarters. After demanding Angel's release again, a drunken Mapache at first appears ready to turn Angel over but slits his throat, and he is subsequently gunned down by Pike and Dutch. After a tense moment, the drunken Mexican soldiers under Mapache react, unsure of what to do. After a few more seconds, Dutch looks at Pike and laughs, actually thinking that they might get away with killing Mapache over it being a justifiable killing. However, Pike is not amused. Apparently, he has already decided to die there. Pike takes deliberate aim at Captain Mohr, Mapache's adviser, and shoots him dead.Mohr's shooting prompts a vicious, bloody gunfight (referred to as the ""Battle of the Bloody Porch"" by the film's crew), as the Bunch shoots their way through Mapache's officers and seizes the machine gun. They inflict scores of casualties on the Mexican solders but finally fall due to the sheer numbers of their foe. Lyle and Tector are shot repeatedly as they try to man the machine gun; after being shot in the back by a Mexican prostitute (whom he kills afterwords) Pike is finally killed by a Mexican boy wielding a rifle and other soldiers in a hail of bullets while manning the machine gun; Dutch is gunned down rushing to his side.After the battle, with Mapache's army nearly wiped out, Thornton and his surviving men ride into town and begin looting the dead bodies of the Mexican soldiers and their prey, while Thornton looks at his fallen colleagues in pity, taking Pike's unused revolver. Thornton declines to join the bounty hunters as they return to the United States, remaining at Agua Verde; they are ambushed and killed somewhere down the trail.In the final scene, Sykes, Don Jose, and a large group of Villa rebels later arrive at the town, and Thornton decides to join them."
Marooned,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064639/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three American astronauts are stranded in space when their retros won't fire. Can they be rescued before their oxygen runs out? After spending several months in an orbiting lab, three astronauts prepare to return to earth only to find their rockets wont fire. After initially thinking they might have to abandon them in orbit, NASA decides to launch a daring rescue. Their plans are complicated by a hurricane headed towards the launch site and a shrinking air supply in the astronauts capsule.—KC Hunt <khunt@eng.morgan.edu> After a crew of three astronauts spend five of a planned seven months working in an orbiting space lab, the three astronauts - Jim Pruitt, Clayton Stone and Buzz Lloyd - are ordered to return to Earth by the head of the program, Charles Keith. They soon find however that their retro-rockets will not fire and they are unable to return. With only 42 hours of oxygen remaining, Keith and many others at NASA try to find a solution to get them back alive. With few options available, Ted Dougherty proposes a rescue mission using an experimental spacecraft that has yet to be rated for manned flight. To make matters worse, a hurricane is approaching the launch site. Faced with insufficient oxygen for all three of them, the astronauts face the ultimate decision. For those who survive, help comes from an unexpected source.—garykmcd Jim Pruett, Clayton Stone and Buzz Lloyd are the three astronauts aboard the Apollo spacecraft Ironman One, which is on a seven month mission to the space lab Saturn 4B (S4B). Due to what looks to be space fatigue, Charles Keith, chief of the space mission at NASA, protracts this mission at the five month stage. After separating Ironman One from the S4B, the astronauts find that their booster engines are not firing, literally meaning that they are stranded in space, with enough oxygen in Ironman One for the three of them for a little less than two days. Those in mission control have to decide whether to risk sending a rescue team which logistically would be a near impossibility to get everything organized to reach Ironman One within that time. Keith and Ted Dougherty, the chief astronaut, are on opposite sides of the argument, with the President ultimately falling on Dougherty's side to launch a rescue mission despite the odds. Dougherty will lead that rescue attempt. Something that reduces the odds even more is that the first hurricane of the Atlantic season has shifted course and is heading toward the Florida coast, Cape Canaveral the only location where there is even a rocket remotely ready to go. While Pruett, Stone and Lloyd's respective wives need to remain stoic both in public and in communicating to their husbands, the three aboard Ironman One have to decide which orders to follow. Most specifically, the three want to try and repair the boosters, not knowing exactly what is wrong with them, while those at mission control have ordered them to remain as inactive as possible to reserve their oxygen supply.—Huggo Images of natural scenery. Then cut to the launch of a space rocket. Three astronauts go in that rocket: Jim Pruett (Richard Crenna), Clayton Stone (James Franciscus) and Buzz Lloyd (Gene Hackman). Back at base, Charles Keith (Gregory Peck) wonders if after eight months in space they could perform the easiest manual tasks. Once in space the astronauts take off their helmets. They lose backup for some reason. Keith decides to bring them down. A journalist (Vincent Van Lynn) explains about the retro-fire and their return. The mission Director (George Gaynes) decides that they need to use the primary thrust, because the secondary is damaged. The communications officer (Tom Stewart) tells the astronauts that. They use the retro-fire.There's a tropical storm and the weather specialist (George Smith) says it'll complicate things. Keith wants to give the mission for lost, and gives an officer 48 hours to rescue the astronauts. They only have another aircraft which has never been tasted and an inexperienced crew. The rules say there should be no rescue mission.Oxygen is scarce, and that's their main concern. Keith tells them not to do anything stupid... like trying to repair the engine!!! The astronauts take sleeping pills because the less movement and anxiety they have, the less oxygen they'll use. Buzz hesitates to have his.The three wives arrive to say goodbye to the astronauts. Celia Pruett (Lee Grant) can't say that she loves him, although he says so. She talks about insurance and the house. For goodbye, they stayed silent. She caresses the screen. Teresa Stone (Nancy Novack) talks about his mission and a project she wants to do. Betty Lloyd (Mariette Hartley) tries to console Buzz, who becomes hysterical. She starts reading a letter she's written to the President (John Forsythe). He interrupts her and says everybody blames him because everything's falling apart.The launch of the rescue mission can't be accomplished because of the bad weather. Keith speaks to the media. Journalists like Hardy (Mauritz Hugo) and Walter Brooke ask about another possible plan, and Keith says there aren't. An PR officer (Scott Brady) explains it.Another plan is thought of. The computer technician (Bruce Rhodewalt) is already working on it. The astronauts are dizzy. The XRV has already been launched. It's insinuated that they should kill one of them so that the other two can survive. Before killing anyone, they'll try to mend the engine.[A funny moment in MST3k 401 when the robots decide that Joel will be the one to die in a case like that on the film because they are cute robots which don't need oxygen. Joel is left feeling lonely and depressed.]Jim's suit gets torn and he dies. Keith tells the news to Celia. A VIP (George R. Robertson) is tense. Rescue is close, so Buzz and Clayton decide to go for it and open the hatch door, although Huston disagrees.

Eddie is a very rich man who has everything he wants; money, family, success, but a car crash causes him to reevaluate the life he leads. Searching for the happiness he lost, he remembers his one-time lover, Gwen, even as his wife conspires to take his fortune...—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Los Angeles-based ad executive Eddie Anderson, born Evangelos Arness to Greek immigrant parents, has launched what is the latest in a string of successful ad campaigns, this one for Zephyr cigarettes, the campaign touting them as the ""clean"" choice, despite what are now the well known health risks of smoking. One day as Eddie is driving to work, he is involved in a major car accident, which could have easily taken his life, but which lands him in hospital with non-life threatening injuries. What only his faithful wife, Florence Anderson, suspects is that Eddie himself caused the accident in an effort to commit suicide. She is only partly correct as Eddie subconsciously changed his mind at the last split second to avoid being killed in the accident. Eddie and Florence have a rather clinical relationship, Florence realizing that he is going through issues, about which he doesn't talk. One of the manifestations of those issues is that he embarked on an affair that Florence is well aware of with a younger woman named Gwen, who worked at the ad agency and whom Florence refers to as the office tramp. Florence is not far off the mark as Gwen was hired primarily into that role for whatever purpose required. Gwen ultimately moved on after Eddie, when she realized that he was not going to divorce Florence. Gwen now lives in New York. Florence says she just wants to help Eddie deal with whatever issues he is facing so that they can move on with their lives together in a positive manner. During his physical and emotional recuperation, Eddie is called to New York to deal with his ailing abusive father, Sam Arness.

Bold. Insightful. Carnal. The Arrangement is for everyone who's reached for the brass ring and come up with his/her own arrangement. Leaving behind his luxurious Los Angeles estate, successful advertising executive Eddie Anderson (a second-generation immigrant) on his way to his agency is triggered into a suicide attempt by the noise and rush of the Los Angeles freeway: he folds his arms and smiles maniacally as his imported sports car rams into a truck. He is not killed, but convalescing at home he refuses to speak except to inform his boss, Finnegan, that he will not return. He daydreams about his stormy relationship with Gwen, a voluptuous research assistant at the agency who has fascinated him by her sneering disdain of his tyrannical success as the idea-man at the agency (selling ""clean"" Zephyr cigarettes). Psychiatrist Dr. Leibman, engaged to treat him, is told briefly of his history by Eddie's wife, Florence, who knows about Gwen and reveals that Eddie's interest in sex ended when he broke off the affair. That night a horrendous nightmare brings Eddie out of his self-imposed silence, and as he tells Florence of his loathing for his life of perpetual ""arrangements,"" she tries to listen sympathetically, hoping to spur his self-confidence, but periodically lapses into a bitter riposte because of his adultery. She persuades him to return to work, but cries herself bitterly to sleep when they cannot make love or achieve any satisfaction from their new understanding. Eddie's return is dramatic, but he insults an important client, upsets a number of office apple carts, and departs in a small plane with which he crazily buzzes the city. His lawyer, Arthur, prevents his arrest and induces Eddie to give Florence his power of attorney before he departs for New York to visit his ailing, senile father, Sam. In New York, he finds Gwen, who has had a child whose father she will not name but Eddie suspects he might be the father; she is now living platonically with Charles, an admirer.

They manage to get old Sam into an ambulance, and Eddie is once again reassured and seduced into accepting ""arrangements"" by Arthur, Florence, and his daughter, Ellen. Gwen soon leaves with Charles, and after Eddie and Florence have another violent confrontation, he goes to Gwen only to be shot by Charles. He then angrily sets the house on fire and is himself sent to a mental hospital. Gwen induces him to leave the institution and escorts him to his father's funeral.

A high ranking Russian official defects to the U.S., where he is interviewed by U.S. Agent Michael Nordstrom. The defector reveals that a French spy ring codenamed ""Topaz"" has been passing N.A.T.O. secrets to the Russians. Michael calls in his French friend and counterpart Andre Devereaux to expose the spies.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> 1962. While vacationing in Copenhagen, KGB official Boris Kusenov, his wife and their daughter are able to defect to the west with prearranged assistance from the US authorities, the operation led by CIA agent Mike Nordstrom, although the defection is not without incident. Kusenov, whose case file at the KGB was primarily NATO, is running away from the Soviets more than he is running toward western ideals, and as such is still reluctant to divulge any Soviet secrets. One of the things he does divulge to Nordstrom and the Americans is that the Soviets are building up military force in Cuba of an unknown nature. Nordstrom knows that the US cannot effectively work on this file because of the strained relationship between the US and Cuba that has thus far culminated with the Bay of Pigs incident. As such, Nordstrom asks his old friend, French intelligence agent André Devereaux whose cover is as a commercial attaché, to pursue this matter on the US's behalf, albeit without it being officially on the books as a French operation. Devereaux agrees if only because of his own intel as to Kusenov's defection, and further intel he is able to get from one of his Franco-American sources as to Cuba. It, however, places a strain on his marriage as it will eventually take him back to Cuba to work with Juanita de Cordoba, the widow of a hero of the Castro-led revolution, and now a lead figure in the anti-Castro underground. Devereaux's wife, Nicole, surmises correctly that Juanita is her husband's mistress, an accusation he denies. Beyond being able to get the necessary information in Cuba which places Devereaux, Juanita and her team's lives in danger, Devereaux may have further problems if Kusenov is forthright in his information on a covert operation code named Topaz.—Huggo A highly ranked Russian official, Boris Kusenov, his wife and daughter defect to America. Hoped to be a boon for their efforts battling the Cold War with Russia, the Americans soon find out that they have more to deal with than first thought, with Kusenov being less than cooperative, especially in regards to anything to do with a known leak in the French government, codenamed ""Topaz"", which has seen top secret files leaked to those in Moscow. On discovering an agreement between the Russians and Cubans, agent Nordstrom enlists the aid of his friend, and French Intelligence Agent, André Devereaux, who, at this time, is accompanying his daughter Michele on her honeymoon with journalist Francois Picard. André accepts, but his wife Nicole is worried for him. After managing to get ahold of some seriously damning papers from the visiting Cuban official Rico Parra, sneakily of course, a concerned Devereaux jets off to Cuba and catches up with his mistress Juanita de Cordoba, who is now secretly involved with a local underground movement while also being involved in another way with Parra. He finds out and kills Juanita. Ever the jet setter, Devereaux is now off home to Paris to get to the bottom of this whole leak problem. Michele wants to reconcile her parents.

Agent Michael Nordstrom. In Washington, D.C., Boris discloses the Russian movement in Cuba, and Nordstrom asks the French agent and his friend, André Devereaux to get further documents from Cuban leader, Rico Parra using his anti-American corrupt secretary Luis Uribe. Devereaux then travels to Cuba to get additional evidence of the Cuban missiles with his mistress, Juanita de Cordoba. When Devereaux returns, he receives orders from the French government to return to France to explain his participation in Cuba. However, Nordstrom schedules a meeting of Devereaux with Boris, and the ex-K.G.B. official tells him about ""Topaz"", the codename for a group of French officials in high circles who work for the Soviet Union. Further, he tells that the French NATO representative, Henri Jarre, is N°. 2 in the chain of command of the spy ring ""Topaz"", leaking classified information to the Soviets, and the head of spies is known only by the codename, ""Columbine"". Devereaux realises he can't reveal the truth before finding who the traitor is.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The story is set in 1962 and opens with images of a Soviet military parade on the Red Square in Moscow, USSR.In Copenhagen, Denmark, a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer defects to the West with his wife and daughter after a chase through the streets from the Soviet embassy to the US embassy. Upon arrival in Washington, DC, CIA agent Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) debriefs him and learns that Russian missiles are to be posted in Cuba. Nordstrom enlists the aid of his friend and French agent André Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), encouraging him to accompany his daughter Michèle (Claude Jade) on her honeymoon with journalist François Picard (Michel Subor) as a premise to get him to New York. André accepts, but his wife Nicole (Dany Robin) is worried for him.In New York City, André entrusts a familiar contact, a former French secret agent named Philippe Dubois (Roscoe Lee Browne), who currently runs a local flower shop in Harlem, to get hold of some seriously damaging papers concerning Soviet plans in Cuba from the visiting Cuban official Rico Parra (John Vernon playing a Fidel Castro-esq character). Parra is in New York to appear at the United Nations and stays at the Cuban consulate in Harlem at the local Hotel Theresa to show solidarity with ""the masses"". Dubois, taking the identity of a black journalist from Ebony, sneaks into the embassy (which is seething with visitors and surrounded by an enthusiastic mob), with a little help from a Cuban diplomat named Luis Uribe (Don Randolph), manages to take photos of some of the documents and then runs away, chased by Cuban revolutionaries. While cunningly dodging away, Dubois shams bumping into and overthrowing André Devereaux, who was watching events from the other side of the street, and slips the camera into his hand. A Cuban guard, named Hernandez (Carlos Rivas) helps André to get up, stares at him, and lets him go. Dubois manages to escape from his Cuban pursuers and returns to his job at working in his flower shop.After examining the photos, Devereaux confirms that the Soviets are secretly transporting and placing nuclear missiles in Cuba. Devereaux, unheeding of his wife's fear and jealousy, jets off to Cuba to find out more details. He catches up with his Cuban mistress Juanita de Cordoba (Karin Dor), widow to a former first-hour wealthy ""hero of the Revolution"", and herself now leader of the local underground resistance network: she acts undercover and collects information as Parra's lover. André, on arriving, finds Parra leaving Juanita's mansion. During a scene of intimacy in the mansion, Devereaux asks her to somehow take photos of the missiles as they are unloaded from Russian boats at the harbor. But Juanita's people, Mr. and Mrs. Mendoza, are arrested and tortured, while Parra's right hand man Hernandez, during a big mass rally held during a lengthy speech of the ""leader màximo"" recognizes André's face from the incident in front of the hotel.Parra, who has heard from the maimed and tortured Mrs. Mendoza that Juanita is their leader, leads a squad of Cuban soldiers to the mansion where he confronts Juanita and, hugging her in his arms, shoots her to save her from being tortured to death.In one of the film's most memorable shots, Juanita is seen from overhead, her dress spreading out on the floor like a bloodstain (although it is purple not red) on the big black-and-white pavement tiles, as she collapses.André is arrested is searched thoroughly at the Havana airport on departure, but the Cuban authorities are unable to find the carefully hidden microfilms, which provide crucial information for the CIA about Soviet activities in Cuba. André finds them hidden behind the cover of a book that Juanita gives him prior to leaving just before she is killed by Parra.At this point, the plot of the movie completely changes course. When André arrives back in Washington, he finds his home empty: his wife deserted him due to his Cuban love interest and returned to Paris. He is also recalled to Paris, but before he leaves, he is informed by Nordstrom about the existence of a Soviet spy organization called 'Topaz' within the French intelligence service. He is given the name of one certain member, NATO official Henri Jarré (Philippe Noiret), who leaked documents to the KGB.On arrival back in Paris, Andre attempts to get to the bottom of the leak, while his daughter Michèle wants to reconcile her parents. He invites some of his old friends and colleagues, including Jarré, to a lunch at a fine restaurant, ""Chez Pierre"". While Jarré eats, André tells the others about Topaz in order to provoke some reaction. Jarré answers that all this is a piece of misinformation, since he knows that the Russian official in fact died a year ago. But he begins to panic, and visits the man who is the leader of the spy ring, Jacques Granville (Michel Piccoli). But Granville, in his night gown, is ""waiting for somebody"". As Jarré is leaving Granville's house, a woman arrives. It is Nicole, André's wife, and as they kiss we see a photo on a stand: Devereaux, Nicole and Granville were old friends from their days together in the French Resistance.Devereaux sends his son-in-law François to interview and extract information out of Jarré. François calls Devereaux from Jarré's home, but the call is cut short. Devereaux and Michèle rush together to Jarré's flat, and find him dead having been thrown from his second floor window and landing on the roof of a parked car. François has disappeared.André and Michèle return to Nicole's, and a short time later François arrives: he was clubbed, but came to and managed to escape from his captors' car. He has overheard a phone number and shows a sketch of Jarré. Nicole, who was staring at the window then turns around and tells her family, with tearful eyes, that the phone number is Granville's, so he must be the leader of the ""Topaz"" organization.Devereaux goes to meet Agent Nordstrom and the Presidential entourage at Orly Airport, and to tell him about Granville. Nordstrom and company then tell the French they will brief them on the missiles in Cuba, but insist Granville not attend.The next morning, Devereaux and his wife, now obviously reconciled in mutual forgiveness, board a Pan Am flight back to Washington. And watch, she in revulsion, he in sardonic good humor, as Granville, bidding Devereaux ""Bon voyage,"" boards an Aeroflot flight back to Moscow. ""He never misses a trick,"" observes Devereaux. ""But at least that's the end of Topaz.""A few days later, the New York Herald-Tribune prints the news that Khruschev has agreed to dismantle the Cuban missile bases. An anonymous reader, sitting on a bench on l'Avenue des Champs-Élysées (with l'Arc de Triomphe in the background), reads the article. He then folds up the paper, sets it on the bench, and walks away.Note: The above is one of three endings for this film that Hitchcock shot. The DVD release has all three:1. In which Granville boards a flight to Moscow in front of Devereaux, who shrugs and says, ""Well, at least that's the end of Topaz."" The final scene plays out as above.2. In which, after the French authorities dismiss Granville from the meeting, we look down the street where Granville lives. A single shot rings out. We presume Granville has committed suicide.

It's the morning after John and Mary's first sexual encounter with each other, which took place in his New York City loft apartment. They had only met for the first time the previous evening at a crowded trendy pick-up bar. They are both uncomfortable with the situation but don't want to show that discomfort to the other. They both realize that they don't know anything substantial about the other - including not even knowing each other's name - as each tries through whatever secret means to find out with who he/she just slept. As they slowly find out more about the other, they inject their own perception into the information, which is sometimes not quite reality. Over the next few hours, they, together and individually, will try to determine if there is any potential future for them, which includes their thoughts about the current most significant other in their respective lives, one who is more significant than the other, and their feelings about what they think the other person is thinking about their future.—Huggo"

So she proceeds to weave a web of romantic complications involving him, his two clerks, a pretty milliner and her assistant. Eventually, of course, all is sorted out, and everyone ends up with the right person.—Tommy Peter The film begins early one summer morning in New York City during the 1890s with everyone welcoming the arrival of a matchmaker named Dolly Levi - Call On Dolly. Dolly Levi, the jack-of-all-trades widow of Ephraim Levi, a dry-goods merchant, is on her way to Yonkers, New York, to arrange the second marriage of Mr. Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire - Just Leave Everything To Me. Meanwhile, in Yonkers, we meet Horace Vandergelder, his long-suffering clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, and his weeping niece Ermengarde. Vandergelder, who believes that everyone in the world with the possible exception of himself is a fool, explains why he has decided to do that most foolish thing, marry again - It Takes A Woman.Dolly arrives and proceeds to clear the field of all rivals, including Mrs. Irene Molloy, a young widow she herself presented to Vandergelder, by telling Vandergelder about a great catch - an heiress - one Ernestina Semple, whom she will introduce to him that very afternoon when he marches in the 14th Street Association Parade. Vandergelder agrees and goes off to New York on business as his two clerks decide they have had enough of Yonkers and are going to New York themselves to get some living into them before it is too late. Cornelius sings to Barnaby about the wonders of the big city and is joined by Dolly as she tries to persuade Vandergelder's niece Ermengarde that it is time for her to rebel too - Put On Your Sunday Clothes. In New York City again, we meet Mrs. Molloy, the young widow whom Vandergelder has been considering as a possible second wife.We find that Mrs. Molloy, too, is tired of her dull existence as a milliner and longs for some adventure herself. By chance, Cornelius and Barnaby take refuge in her shop to avoid meeting Vandergelder. While they are hidden in cupboards and under tables, Dolly, Mrs. Molloy and Minnie Fay - Mrs. Molloy's assistant - distract the suspicious Vandergelder. Despite their best efforts, Vandergelder discovers there are men in the shop, and though he does not know who the men are, he is angry enough to break off relations with Mrs. Molloy and inform Mrs. Levi that he will meet her ""heiress"" that evening at the end of the parade. Mrs. Molloy is furious, and Dolly, seeing that Cornelius is much taken with the young widow, patches things up and arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby to take Mrs. Molloy and Minnie Fay to dinner at the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant. Cornelius, mindful of the fact that he has somewhat less than three dollars in his pocket, suggests that he couldn't go to a fashionable place like the Harmonia Gardens because they have dancing there and he doesn't know how. And so Dolly teaches Cornelius, Barnaby and finally, everyone on the block - Dancing.An exuberant Cornelius takes Mrs. Molloy off to see the 14th Street Parade, and Dolly, having brought them together, is once more alone. She speaks to her late husband, Ephraim Levi, and explains why she wants to marry Horace Vandergelder. She is tired of leading a safe, solitary existence and longs to ""rejoin the human race."" The scene changes to 14th Street as Dolly, joined by all the marchers, restates her determination - Before The Parade Passes By. Cornelius and Barnaby then convince Mrs. Molloy and Minnie Fay that the really ""elegant"" way for them to go down to the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant is to walk - Elegance. Meanwhile, at the Harmonia Gardens, the entire staff is buzzing with the news that Dolly is coming back for the first time since Ephraim Levi's death. By eight o'clock the excitement has reached fever pitch as the curtains of the main entrance part and Mrs. Levi, resplendent in a glittering red dress, starts down the stairs - Hello, Dolly! Dolly pulls out all the stops as she sets about hooking Vandergelder.First she assumes that he wants to marry her and firmly turns him down; then she paints a dreary picture of what life in Yonkers will be without her; and finally she proves to him that his well-ordered existence is somewhat less than that during the confusion engendered by his discovering not only Cornelius and Barnaby, but also his niece Ermengarde, in the Harmonia Gardens show. He discharges Cornelius on the spot and is amazed to hear his once-humble clerk take this blow with equanimity and declare his love for Mrs. Molloy in front of one and all - It Only Takes A Moment. Forced into the streets of New York City for creating a disturbance at the Harmonia Gardens, Vandergelder - obdurate as ever - hears Dolly tell him the only thing she can say under the circumstances - So Long, Dearie. Back in Yonkers, Vandergelder, now without clerks, without niece and without Dolly, realizes that he's been as big a fool as everyone else - and he'd be an even greater fool if he let this wonderful woman out of his life. And so he asks Dolly, who conveniently returns, having expected just such a turn of events, to forgive him and marry him as he sings Hello, Dolly! in the finale."

The Battle of Britain,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064072/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1940, the British Royal Air Force fights a desperate battle to prevent the Luftwaffe from gaining air superiority over the English Channel as a prelude to a possible Axis invasion of the U.K. Historical reenactment of the air war in the early days of World War II for control of the skies over Britain as the new Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force determine whether or not an invasion can take place.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> It is 1940, and the diabolical mind of Adolf Hitler is planning to bomb England into submission to his warped dreams of a ""Fortress Europe"". Standing between Britain's freedom and Hitler's terrifying plans is the Royal Air Force, dedicated pilots who took to the skies again and again in the face of overwhelming odds. The German Luftwaffe's planes outnumber the R.A.F.'s by more than two to one, six hundred fifty planes of the R.A.F. versus two thousand five hundred of the Luftwaffe. These odds, however, do not deplete the determination of the R.A.F. to stop Hitler, and as the Luftwaffe launches wave after wave of Heinkel 111 bombers against British cities, the R.A.F. responds, under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal Park (Trevor Howard) and Squadron Leaders Canfield (Sir Michael Caine) and Harvey (Christopher Plummer), who lead the newest pilots of the R.A.F. into confrontation after confrontation with the Luftwaffe's experienced veterans, with the aim of driving Hitler's forces away from Dover's white cliffs for good.—Derek O'Cain May, 1940. The German army has overrun France and the British Royal Air Force is evacuating its aircraft and pilots. A squadron of Hawker Hurricanes is quickly refueled and flown off ahead of the advancing Germans. Just as the ground personnel are torching the unflyable aircraft, a squadron of German ME-109s screams in at treetop level and shoots up the airfield.Back in Britain, Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding (Sir Laurence Olivier) recommends to Prime Minister Churchill that no further British fighter aircraft be risked in the defense of France. The British army is already being evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk. The precious fighter planes will be needed for the defense of Britain. In conquered France, a large group of German HE-111 bombers is drawn up around a former French airfield, ready to deploy against the British Isles.A German diplomat, Baron Max von Richter (Curt Jurgens) makes an arrogant overture to British ambassador Sir David Kelly (Ralph Richardson) in neutral Switzerland. If the isolated British agree to allow Hitler a free hand in continental Europe, Germany will not use the Luftwaffe to flatten British cities in preparation for an invasion. The high-handed German receives an icy reception from the ambassador.At an RAF airfield in southeastern England, green pilots are hurriedly trained. A crusty RAF officer known only as 'Skipper' (Robert Shaw) takes one of his fledgling pilots up for special attention in the new Spitfire. The RAF begins to organize the coastal fighter defenses against the expected German air assault. They are counting heavily on the ability of the new coastal radar towers to provide early warning of incoming German air raids. Even with the assistance of radar, the German numerical advantage means that British pilots must shoot down German planes at the rate of four to one.RAF Squadron Leader Colin Harvey (Christopher Plummer), who is being transferred to Scotland, drives into town to meet his WAAF wife Maggie (Susannah York) at an inn. There is tension in the marriage. He wants her to apply for a posting in Scotland, but she resists. At the nearby airfield, there is a surprise visit from irascible Air Vice Marshal Keith Park (Trevor Howard). He admonishes new Squadron Leader Canfield (Michael Caine) that his pilots must be prepared to go up and meet the enemy with only two minutes warning.In contrast to the hard-pressed British, the victorious Germans are supremely confident and cocky. Invasion barges are being transported to the Channel Coast. On August 10, the Luftwaffe launches Operation 'Adlertag' (Eagle Day), a massive strike against British radar sites and airfields near the coast. HE-111 bombers and ME-109 fighters roar from their French airfields. The attack is preceded by JU-87 Stuka dive bombers, dropping their payloads on the troublesome British radar towers. The vulnerable Stukas are soon set upon by British Spitfires, who make short work of them. Close behind the dive bombers, more than 100 Heinkel HE-111s cross the British coastline, escorted by ME-109 fighters. The British airfields are soon under heavy attack, as the pilots scramble to get their Hurricanes and Spitfires airborne. The British inflict aircraft losses on the Germans at a three-to-one rate, but the airfields are heavily damaged. After the attack, RAF Group Captain Baker (Kenneth More) surveys the damage to his own airfield. The British ruefully acknowledge that the German strategy of attacking their airfields is working.In an attempt to overwhelm the British defenses, the Germans mount simultaneous raids against southeastern England (from France) and northern England (from Norway). However, the bomber formations from Norway must proceed without fighter escort. Squadron Leader Harvey's fast Spitfires take a horrendous toll on the lumbering HE-111 bombers, shooting down 23 without loss. Yet the pilot and aircraft attrition rate is still working against the British.Adding to the RAF's problems is a personal verbal battle between the commanding officers of 11 Group, Keith Park (Trevor Howard), and 12 Group, Trafford Leigh-Mallory (Patrick Wymark). 12 Group is tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields while 11 Group meets the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the ""Big Wing"" tactic takes time for form up, while Park complains that the tactic simply is not working. Dowding ends the debate noting a critical shortage of pilots, wearily remarking, ""We're fighting for survival, and losing.""Just as Squadron Leader Harvey and his wife Maggie rendezvous at a swank London hotel, wayward German bombers accidentally drop the first bombs on the city, but they both survive. Hitler had previously avoided targeting London in hopes of avoiding the remorseless total war that would surely follow. In retaliation, the British stage their first air raids on Berlin. Though the damage is negligible, an enraged Adolf Hitler publicly orders London to be razed. Hermann Göring (Hein Riess) arrives in France to personally command the attack, confident that the end of the battle nears. Their first attack skirts the RAF, who are still defending their airfields to the south, and they bomb unopposed. Night time attacks follow and London burns.Meanwhile, to supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has been forming units of foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries; the main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a Free Polish squadron accidentally runs into an unescorted flight of German bombers. Ignoring the commands of their British training officer, they peel off one by one and shoot down several of the bombers with unorthodox aggressive tactics. Park rewards them by elevating them to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the Canadian and Czech squadrons as well.While discussing the day's events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able to repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to full strength. Dowding adds that 12 Group units north of London are now all within range, while enemy fighters are at the extreme edge of their own range. He concludes that ""turning on London could be the German's biggest blunder.""The next German daytime raid is met by a massive response; watching his formations build up in 11 Group's operations room, Wing Commander Willoughby (Robert Flemyng) wryly states ""this should give them something to think about."" RAF fighters arranged into large groups, attack en masse, overwhelming the German raids. Göring is incensed, ordering his fighters remain with the bombers, an order the pilots hate. Losses continue to mount on both sides.The desperate struggle reaches a crescendo on September 15, 1940 (the Battle of Brittan Day). The Luftwaffe launches wave after wave of bombers and fighters against London. Winston Churchill is in attendance at 11 Group's operations room. In the underground bunker, British ground control personnel order every squadron into the air to meet the massive attack. Intense combat in the sky over London follows, with both sides taking heavy losses. The outcome is so confused that Dowding refuses to comment on the events to the local press. RAF pilots shoot down scores of German bombers against less than 30 British fighters lost.It is effectively the end of daylight raids against Britain, and having failed to subdue the RAF, Hitler cancels the invasion of England.The next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Likewise the Luftwaffe is disheartened by heavy losses and also await orders that never come to resume raiding. Two German anti-aircraft gunners, who had earlier observed a French port teeming with Kriegsmarine vessels and landing barges, now observe a deserted harbour basin. Göring leaves the front by train to travel back to Berlin, accusing his commanders of betrayal.In the final shot, Dowding looks out over the gardens and up to the sky where the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.""The text also shows that approximately 350 British RAF pilots have given their lives in the Battle of Britain, as well as 100 more pilots from Australia, Canada, South Africa, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other Allied nations."

While in prison, Sartet shared a cell with an electrician (Christian de Tillière) who installed an extensive security system at a diamond exhibition in Rome.

Sartet offered a sympathetic ear and the electrician supplied him with the complete security system details.Vittorio and a fellow Mafiose, Tony Nicosia (Amedeo Nazzari) of New York, visit the exhibition but find that additional security has been added that make what would have been a simple robbery very difficult. When they purposefully set off the alarm system, they find the local police station is just down the road from the exhibition hall. Nicosia conceives of an alternative plan to steal the diamonds while they are in transit to another show in New York. He sends Jack (Sydney Chaplin), an alcoholic, to France to inform Vittorio with the details.Commissaire Le Goff (Lino Ventura) pursues Sartet with unbridled determination. Sartet killed two of his men in cold blood during an earlier arrest. Guessing that Sartet needs false papers in order to leave the country, Le Goff's enquiries lead him to the Malanese and their arcade game business which serves as a cover for their more illegal activities. While he questions Vittorio, Sartet slips out of the building in a car, right under Le Goff's nose.Jeanne (Irina Demick), wife of Vittorio's son Aldo and an able crook in her own right, becomes increasingly fascinated by Sartet.

The Secret of Santa Vittoria,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064952/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During WWII in Italy, a wine-producing village hides a million bottles from the Germans Bombolini is a fairly-worthless drunk in the small Italian town of Santa Vittoria in the closing days of World War II. When word comes that the Fascist government has surrendered, he climbs a water tower to tear down the flag. He can't get down and someone gets the crowd to chant his name to give him confidence. The Fascist town council hears this and believes that he is the town's new leader. They surrender to him and make him the new mayor. He rises to the occasion and when he finds that the Germans plan to occupy his town and take their wine (over a million bottles), he works out a plan to hide it.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1943, the deposition ofBenito Mussoliniseemingly has little emotional effect on the largely-uneducated peasant citizenry of the small Italian town of Santa Vittoria--except for a politically-aware young man named Fabio de la Romagna who considers him a tyrant, and the pro-Mussolini forces of the grand council who can see the inevitable writing on the wall of what will imminently happen throughout Italy. The council appoints Italo Bombolini, largely seen as a drunkard and a buffoon--even by his exasperated, outspoken, forthright wife Rosa, as mayor to deal with whatever happens next; unaware of the entire situation, he happily accepts. They learn that the Nazis are beginning to occupy most Italian towns; they're making their way to Santa Vittoria to pillage it of its emotional heart and economic soul: its 1 million bottles of wine. Largely devised by Carlo Tufa, an injured Italian soldier who deserted and the town is collectively hiding, Bombolini decides, with the entire town's support, to hide most of the wine proverbially in plain sight, setting aside a small fraction for the Nazis to ""discover."" Thus begins a battle of wits between Captain Sepp Von Prum, the Commanding Officer of the Nazi forces in Santa Vittoria, who believes Bombolini isn't being forthright about the town's assets, especially the wine; and Bombolini who, despite the hopes and prayers of the townsfolk resting largely on his shoulders, begins to doubt his abilities as mayor in protecting them from the Nazis. Educated, elegant Caterina Malatesta, who nursed Tufa with the result that the two have fallen in love, catches Von Prum's eye and thus could be used as a pawn in the proceedings; she's well aware of the tenuousness of the situation for anything long-term happening between herself and Tufa.—Huggo"

They instantly bond - initially over the rescue of an injured seagull - with the three entering into a friendship where they do everything together in solidarity with little respect for others, especially the adult figures in their life. They almost become indistinguishable as individuals when together, such as being in a gang. Things change when they meet another vacationing teen named Rhoda later in the summer. Rhoda is shy, seemingly insecure (which the three later learn for good reason), overly analytical and straight-laced, but she needs the acceptance of her peers. Then, the individual personalities of the three friends begins to emerge, Peter being the sensitive one, Dan the overly confident one who may not have reason to be, and Sandy the manipulative one, especially in using her sexuality to control the two males. But Rhoda, in asserting her own beliefs, may not have a chance when dealing with the three as a group.—Huggo Four teenagers on Fire Island experience the pains and pleasures of
adolescence when they experiment with alcohol, drugs, and sex along the coast near a parent's summer home, resulting in tragedy when Rhoda, a misfit who wants to join them, is raped by the other three. Sandy (Barbara Hershey) is the group's key leader and manipulator who lures her boyfriends (Richard Thomas, Bruce Davison) into her scheme by asking them to help her take a fish hook out of an injured seagull. The gull is nursed to health and they try to train it to fly on a string. The misfit (Catherine Burns) protests they are being cruel and seeks out their sympathy about the death of her mother.

King Henry VIII (Richard Burton) of England discards one wife, Catharine of Aragon (Irene Papas), who has failed to produce a male heir, in favor of a young and beautiful woman, Anne Boleyn (Geneviève Bujold), whose one-thousand-day reign as Queen of England ends with the loss of her head on the block. Henry weds Anne and soon she gives him a child. The girl, Elizabeth (Amanda Jane Smythe), is a bitter disappointment to Henry, who desperately wants an heir. Anne promises Henry a son ""next time"", but Henry is doubtful. Shortly thereafter, rumors begin that the King's eye has already wandered. One Jane Seymour (Lesley Paterson) is at court for a moment. The Queen has her sent away, but, if Anne will bring Jane back to court, the King promises to sign the Act of Succession to insure that Elizabeth will be Queen.—alfiehitchie King Henry VIII (Richard Burton) of England is contemplating what to do about his nearly one thousand day union to his second wife, Anne Boleyn (Geneviève Bujold). The marriage has been controversial in that he, a devoutly religious man, had to break ties with the Catholic church in Rome so that he could divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Irene Papas), whom he married for political reasons. As such, many of his subjects consider his marriage to Anne as being not valid, and Anne a whore. The marriage to Anne has also been tempestuous as Anne wanted to marry the young Lord Percy (Terence Wilton), with whom she was in love. But Anne eventually learned to love the power that being Queen of England would bring, a position which was fostered by her family, who could only see the benefit of such a union. The King's current contemplation of what to do stems from what he sees as Anne not fulfilling her end of the marriage in not producing a viable male heir to become the next King of England, she only bearing a daughter, Elizabeth (Amanda Jane Smythe), and a stillborn son. He sees Jane Seymour (Lesley Paterson), one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting, as being a potential Queen in her place. As much as Henry will do whatever in his power to get that desired male heir (his union to Catherine also produced only a daughter), Anne, who Henry professes to love, will do anything to ensure what she considers her and Elizabeth's rightful place within the monarchy.—Huggo Based on the Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson, ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" is a sympathetic account of the rise and fall of the beautiful and ambitious Anne Boleyn who becomes the second wife of the tyrannical King Henry VIII. Engaged to another man, Anne attempts to avoid the king's attention and refuses to become his mistress, but her betrothal is broken-off by Henry's corrupt but brilliant chief minister. Vowing vengeance, Anne returns to the court, where Henry eventually proposes marriage and promises to divorce his aging Spanish wife. Anne accepts and soon becomes the most powerful and wealthiest woman in the country, rewarding her allies and punishing her enemies. After some years, she and Henry finally marry, but her world slowly begins to collapse when she fails to give birth to the son her husband so desperately wants and he openly flaunts his mistresses in her face. Anne's enemies move against her, concocting a sensational set of lies to destroy her and they triumph in a brutally unfair show-trial which ends Anne's thousand-day reign as queen of England."

That friendship is threatened in their mutual attraction to a young slave boy named Gitone, which serves as the backdrop to other goings-on as they move from situation to situation in the extreme hedonism of the ancient Rome. The situations often place both men in a position of survival as hedonism is prioritized over life.—Huggo [The film is loosely based on the book Satyricon attributed to Petronius Arbiter, and dated to the time of the rule of Nero (37-68 AD). The book is considered to be one of the first, if not the first, novels to have been written, but has only survived in fragments. The film imitates this by being fragmentary itself, leaving gaps between events, and even stopping in mid-sentence. However, there is a definite plot. Breaks in the plot representing the missing parts are given below with a double hyphen --]The film opens with the protagonist Encolpio, a student, who is furious with his room-mate Ascilto, who has run off with their boy-slave Gitone. Encolpio tracks down Ascilto to the baths, and during a fight Ascilto admits to having sold the boy to Vernacchio who runs a theatre. Encolpio goes to the theatre and challenges Vernacchio during a performance, and gets the boy back through the intervention of a magistrate who is attending the play.Encolpio and Gitone walk through the streets of Rome to go home. Seeing the magistrate has followed them and is beckoning to them, they dive into a brothel, and escape out of a back door, and then return to Encolpio's apartment. Ascilto returns too, and the two argue and decide to split up and divide their possessions. Gitone, allowed to choose who he goes with, chooses Ascilto. Only an earthquake saves Encolpio from committing suicide.--We find Encolpio in a museum, admiring the works. He bumps into an impoverished old man, Eumolpus, a poet, who is declaiming on the greatness of the classics and bemoaning the wretched state of modern art. Eumolpus takes Encolpio under his wing, and takes him to a feast at the villa of Tremalchio, a rich merchant despised by Eumolpus for his lack of culture. At the villa the guests are bathing before the meal, and Tremalchio seeing Eumolpus praises him as a colleague poet.The guests enter the villa for the meal. During the meal the poet Eumolpus and the host Trimalchio become steadily more drunk, and in the end have an argument when Eumolpus accuses Trimalchio of plagiarism. Trimalchio orders his slaves to throw Eumolpus in the furnace, and a fierce fight follows in the kitchens.Trimalchio gets morbid and takes his guests to the tomb where he will be buried when he dies. He bids everyone to act out his funeral. During the mock funeral a tale is told: a beautiful, newly-widowed woman decides to starve herself to death by her late husband's dead body in his tomb. A soldier who is guarding the bodies of recently executed prisoners, hears her wailing and goes to her. While they are together, the family of one of the executed takes his body, and when the soldier realises this he contemplates suicide as better than the punishment he will get. The widow however offers the body of her husband to hang up in the place of the criminal, to save the soldier's life.Walking home after the feast, Encolpio finds the battered but still living Eumolpus. He stays with him, and they fall asleep by a lake.--Encolpio awakes, and to his shock everything has changed. He has been taken prisoner by Lichas, a treasure seeker who collects beautiful things and people and takes them to the sickly young Caesar who lives exiled on an island. Encolpio is bundled on to a ship, and sees that Ascilto and Gitone have been captured too.During the voyage Lichas's eye falls on Encolpio, and marries him in a ceremony on the deck.
Meanwhile, the young Caesar is overthrown. A marauding party boards Lichas's ship, and kills him.--A war follows as the new Caesar takes power.--We see a man and his wife whose property is to be confiscated by the new Caesar sending their children off to safety. He frees his slaves, and waves his children goodbye, telling them he will see them soon. He then commits suicide, telling his wife not to do the same.Later Ascilto and Encolpio creep onto the now-deserted property, and see the dead bodies of the man and his wife. They go into the house and explore, and discover a weeping slave girl. Seeing them she cheers up, and after a chase through the building, and a meal, the three spend the night together. They awake to the sound of burning. Looking out they see that the suicides have been put on a pyre by soldiers.--Ascilto and Encolpio are travelling with a caravan of people going to visit a hermaphrodite child demi-god at a temple. During an overnight stop they are told that one of the travellers is going because his wife has been beset with nymphomania and he hopes the god will cure her. But in the meantime he will pay them well if they will go and satisfy the wife.--The temple is a centre of pilgrimage for sick people wishing to be cured. The following night a man persuades Ascilto and Encolpio to help him steal the demi-god. They kill his keepers, and run off pulling the boy in a cart. However, the child cannot cope with the heat of the sun out of doors, and the next night dies. The man blames Ascilto and Encolpio and a fight ensues where the man is killed.--Possibly as a result of the theft, Encolpio has been captured, and is thrown into the Minotaur's labyrinth. If he defeats the Minotaur, his prize will be 'love'. He fails, but the minotaur is charmed by him and declares him a new friend, and refuses to kill him. As a result Encolpio may claim his prize, a session of passion with the beautiful Ariadne - in full view of the watching crowd. He approaches her, joins her on the bed, and discovers he has 'lost his sword'. Ariadne pushes him off in disgust and runs off.And there is Eumolpus, now rich, and degenerate just like the Tremalchio he once so despised. He is a rich trader and his ship will be sailing again soon. He will help Encolpio restore his power, and suggests a visit to the Garden of Delights.--At the Garden of Delights, Encolpio fails to be cured. The curator there tells him the story of Oenothea, a woman who was cursed by a wizard for teasing him sexually, her punishment being literally fire between her thighs.--Ascilto and Encolpio travel to visit Oenothea. On the way the ferryman overhears that they have gold with them as payment. Oenothea cures Encolpio, but the ferryman fatally wounds Ascilto in a fight for the gold.--Mourning, Encolpio makes his way to the harbour where Eumolpus's ship will be sailing. But Eumolpus has died. He has left a will that frees his slaves, and grants his riches to those he mentions only if they will eat his body. Some agree to.

Dean Higgins also recites a list of students that are to be placed on academic probation since they aren't currently meeting Medfield's standards. A collection of students are eavesdropping on the meeting using a planted walkie-talkie. Dexter Riley, one of the students, comes up with a plan to ask wealthy local businessman A.J. Arno, his former employer, if he will donate the money for a computer. A delegation of students goes to Mr Arno to make the request & although he initially declines he later has a change of heart. After the students leave we see Mr Arno go into a secret office where we see several of his employees using a computer to keep track of Mr Arno's collections from his numerous illegal gambling operations. He tells one of his employees not to send a check to Medfield College but doesn't say why not but the next scene reveals it's because he donated his computer to the school instead. On the day the donated computer is being installed Dean Higgins receives a letter from Mr Arno stating he is donating the computer in lieu of his normal $20,000 annual donation, which vexes the dean since he counted on the cash for other purchases. Dexter unknowingly brags to Dean Higgins that he was responsible for Mr Arno's computer donation which annoys the dean. After the computer is installed, Professor Quigley demonstrates the utility of the computer to his class. When the computer has a malfunction the professor determines it needs a new electronic part which Dexter volunteers to get. Later that night when he returns with the part & attempts to install it during a rain storm, Dexter receives a great shock as he handles wires from the computer while standing in water. He walks away unharmed but the next day it's discovered the computer isn't working. Later that same night one of Dexter's roommates hears Dexter talking in a robotic voice & beeping in his sleep. Later that day the students are all taking a timed test & Dexter finishes the 90 minute exam, which no one has ever finished, in 5 minutes & made a perfect score. Dexter is then examined by a doctor so the dean & the professor are shown that the inside of Dexter's head now looks like computer parts. In an effort to cash in on Dexter's newfound abilities Dean Higgins arranges a televised interview during which Dexter correctly answers questions from experts in several different academic fields. Dexter's success leads to a national tour where he's given a ticker-tape parade & then he demonstrates his intellectual prowess to UN delegates by learning multiple languages very quickly. He also unsuccessfully attempts to help a diamond cutting expert correct his miscalculation before cutting the world's largest diamond. The diamond shatters when he attempts the cut, ostensibly because he rejected Dexter's advice. Interspersed with these scenes of Dexter's tour we learn of a plan by Dean Collingsgood from rival State University to convince Dexter to leave Medfield & enroll at State. Mr Arno also decides he wants to put Dexter's abilities to use in his gambling operation & arranges to pick him up when he returns from his tour. Dexter is met at the airport by his friends who are happy he's home & want him to come hang out with them. Dexter rejects going with his friends to meet with Mr Arno, who takes him to the track. Dexter picks winners for every race that day. Later that evening Mr Arno's right hand man Chili Walski takes Dexter to dinner at one of the gambling operations, where Dexter is followed by both Dean Higgins & Dean Collingsgood. The police raid the gambling house & everyone, including Dexter, Chili & both deans, ends up in jail. While talking with Chili & listening to the deans argue with each other in jail, Dexter realizes that everyone he's been in contact with lately has their own best interests in mind. The guard comes to get Dexter & he & Chili both assume it's Mr Arno bailing him out. As Dexter gets to the desk he sees it's his college buddies who have spent every dollar they have to post bail. He apologizes to them all for not recognizing the true value of his friends & they readily accept his apology. Dexter decides to re-enroll at Medfield & promptly start studying for an intercollegiate academic contest which has a grand prize of $100,000. Instead of using other egghead students as teammates as suggested by Dean Higgins Dexter opts to include his buddies, all of whom were on the academic probation list earlier. Although Dexter tries to enlist his friends help during the contests, his buddies seem to lack the ability to help him even a little so Dexter singlehandedly begins winning contest after contest. During the semi-final round one of the answers makes Dexter go into a trancelike state & start reciting locations & financial returns for several of Mr Arno's operations until his buddy jars his elbow & makes him come to himself. Dexter doesn't even remember what he said during his trance. Mr Arno is watching the academic contest & gets upset when he realizes that Dexter could potentially spill the beans on all of his operations since it was all stored in the donated computer. He tells Chili to kidnap Dexter until they decide what to do about it. Chili snatches Dexter the night before the academic contest final where Medfield will be facing arch-rival State University. When Dexter's friends realize he's disappeared they listen to a recording of Dexter's trance sequence until they realize that it was all about Mr Arno's gambling operations. Knowing that Arno is probably at the bottom of Dexter's disappearance, they watch his business then follow Chili from there to where Dexter's being kept. They also send the recording to the police with an explanation of what they think it's all about. Mr Arno's men have kept Dexter busy picking horse races but when Chili arrives & tells them the plan involves killing Dexter, Dexter overhears but can't get away. On the day of the contest Dean Higgins has no choice but to let Dexter's buddies represent Medfield without Dexter since no one can locate him. Meanwhile that same day Dexter's college buddies have surrounded the house disguised as house painters. They have a phony work order but when Chili calls to verify it one of the friends who's in on the plan answers the phone like the local paint store. The friends/painters are trying to locate Dexter as they paint all around the house by looking in every window, meanwhile the crooks are trying to decide how to get Dexter out without the painters seeing him. Mr Arno arrives & get angry at the painters surrounding the house. Chili insists the painters are legit but when Mr Arno calls a different student answers the phone & gives goofball answers to Mr Arno's questions. Mr Arno tells Chili to stuff Dexter into an old steamer trunk & carry him out in that. When Mr Arno arrives the friends decide to sneak into the house to try to discover his location. They are in just the right spot to waylay the crooks & get the trunk away from them but in the process the trunk with Dexter inside gets bounced several times out a window, down a scaffold & eventually onto the ground. While Dexter was being rescued some of the students poured paint into the gangster's cars gas tanks. The students put the trunk onto their paint truck, pile on themselves then flee just as the crooks come out of the house. After realizing their cars are no good, the gangsters pile into the students' dune buggy & pursue them. The students are unsuccessful at opening the trunk as they race down the road but do manage to get away from the crooks by throwing everything in the back of the paint truck at the dune buggy & eventually by using the paint sprayer to cause them to wreck. They manage to unlock the trunk just as they arrive at the site of the contest during halftime. When he comes out of the trunk Dexter is physically cramped up & complains that his head hurts from being bounced around but Dean Higgins is unsympathetic & insists that he be carried to the stage before the second half starts. As the questions begin Dexter seems uncharacteristically slow with his answers but he is still correct every time. Although Dexter continues to speak slower with each answer & eventually starts stuttering during his responses, Medfield slowly catches up to State & takes the lead. With 1 minute left State takes the lead back when Dexter collapses in the middle of an answer, allowing State to steal the points. Medfield is given one final question with a chance to win but Dexter realizes he's lost his genius abilities. Dexter's buddy Schuyler starts trying to coax the answer out of him, similar to the way Dexter had encouraged him earlier in the contests, giving him clues & saying ""Come on, buddy, you know this"" when suddenly he realizes he knows the answer himself. He manages to get the answer out just as time is expiring so Medfield wins the grand prize. While all of this was taking place the police managed to confirm the information from Dexter's trance tape is related to Mr Arno's illegal gambling operations. The crooks arrive as the contest ends so Dexter & a friend race away in the paint truck. Mr Arno & the crooks give pursuit but because of the paint on the windshield they crash into the police car that is arriving to arrest him. The final scene is again the boardroom where Dean Higgins is denying Professor Quigley's request for an electro-helio-spectrograph, expensive lab equipment necessary to keep the school up-to-date, this time so the dean can pay for new plumbing. The students are eavesdropping again & disappointed that their efforts won't be rewarded with new lab equipment. As the meeting of students breaks up, Dexter's girlfriend tells him that if they ever do get a new electro-helio-spectrograph, he shouldn't fool around with it."

Take the Money and Run,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065063/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life and times of Virgil Starkwell, inept bank robber. This film is presented as a documentary on the life of an incompetent, petty criminal called Virgil Starkwell. It describes the early childhood and youth of Virgil, his failure at a musical career, and his obsession with bank robberies. The film uses a voice over narrative and interviews with his family, friends and acquaintances.—Kunal Taravade <kunal.taravade@symbios.com> Clumsy Virgil Starkwell was bullied when he was a child. Then he decides to play cello, but without any musical talent, the loser joins a street gang and ends up in prison. When he escapes, he meets laundry worker Louise and lies to her, telling that he plays cello in the symphonic orchestra. He is arrested in a hold up and Louise finds him in prison. He breaks out and flees with Louise to another state. He tries to be honest but he is incapable to fit in any job. When he finally finds a job position suitable for him, he is blackmailed by a colleague and returns to his criminal life. But his heists are disastrous and he always ends in prison.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The life of Virgil Starkwell, still a young man, is presented, that presentation partly through interviews with family and acquaintances. He has been in and out of prison since he was in his mid-twenties, primarily for armed robberies. His down and out life was largely predetermined having grown up in the slums of New York City, and never having fit in anywhere in society, being shunned if not bullied. His life of crime began as a means of survival since he was inept at everything else, which is not to say that he is also inept as a robber, hence the reason he has been caught so easily time after time. His life has the potential to change when he meets and falls in love with Louise, a laundress. Louise is also somewhat of an outsider in society, she having grown up in a dysfunctional household with a strict military father and alcoholic mother. As Virgil and Louise try to eke out a life together, the fact of Louise in his life will either make Virgil turn to a life of the straight and narrow, or conversely do anything required to support her.—Huggo A mock documentary which traces the criminal career of Virgil Starkwell from his childhood through his incarceration for bank robbery. Along the way we learn much about Virgil's childhood, his musical (and moral) education, and the vagaries of his relationships with women.—Scott R. Vaughn <scott@vaughn.hon.msu.edu>"

Burn!,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064866/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During a slave revolt in 1844, a British mercenary helps an Antilles island colony gain independence from Portugal, but later returns to hunt down a local rebel leader and former protégé. The professional mercenary Sir William Walker instigates a slave revolt on the Caribbean island of Queimada in order to help improve the British sugar trade. Years later he is sent back to deal with the same rebels that he built up because they have seized too much power that now threatens British sugar interests.—Anonymous Sir William Walker arrived on the island of Queimada in the middle of the 19th century on a secret mission from the British Crown. The Antillean island has borne its name - ""the burnt one"" - since the warlike attacks of the Portuguese. The Portuguese exterminated the indigenous population with fire and sword and then brought blacks as slaves to the sugar cane plantations, to which the island owes its wealth. In order to enrich themselves from the sugar business, the English now want to bring the island under their influence. In the young black José Dolores, the British adventurer Walker finds a man who seems suitable for his plans. José becomes the leader of an uprising without suspecting that he - like the ambitious Teddy Sanchez - is only a tool of the British and his employers. When Walker has achieved his goal and the British have consolidated their power, he leaves the island. Ten years later he is brought back - this time as a military advisor to an unsuccessful general. Walker is to help him destroy José Dolores and his guerrillas, who have been robbed of the fruits of their struggle. In the 19th century, the cynical, pragmatic British agent William Walker arrives in Queimada, a Portuguese colony in the Antilles, to promote a revolution and benefit the sugar trade with England. He finds in the water-and-luggage-carrier José Dolores the necessary potential to be the leader of the slave revolt, and the Portuguese troops are expelled from the island; then the provisional government of President Teddy Sanchez assumes the power with the support of the British government. Ten years later, William is hired by the Royal Company that is exploring the sugar cane plantations and the Queimada government to chase José Dolores, who is disturbing the economical interests of England in sugar cane with his army of rebels.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sir William Walker (Marlon Brando) is called to the island of Queimada in the Antilles to foment a rebellion against Portuguese rule, to benefit British sugar traders. He singles out a porter named José Dolores (Evaristo Márquez) and tries to insult and humiliate him to goad him into betraying some rebellious spirit. When this eventually works, Walker beings to fashion Delores into a revolutionary leader. At the same time Walker meets with the colonial leaders (ethnic Portuguese) and encourages them to lead the revolution, lest the slaves lead the revolution on their own, which would threaten all white infrastructure, and lives, on the island. The revolution succeeds, the Portuguese are expelled, subtle power struggles ensue between the former colonials and the freed black slaves, and the future of sugar exports is uncertain. Having completed his mission, Walker returns to England.10 years later representatives from a sugar company are trying to find Walker with a business proposition. They find him in the slums of an English city, apparently not living a lifestyle becoming a gentleman of his status, his clothes notwithstanding. He is then charged with ending a rebellion on Queimada between the former slaves and the white rulers.Upon arriving on Queimada, Walker gives an expository on the phases of rebellion and truce that have transpired on the island in the last 10 years. He sends an envoy to Delores (the same leader as before) inviting him to dialogue. He also sends a familiar alcoholic drink. Delores responds by sending a wagon to a government fortification with three dead soldiers, and the alcohol, making it clear that he is not prepared to talk.Walker then sets out to destroy the rebellion. First, however, he takes the time to lecture the government leaders that the rebels are desperate and destitute while the government forces are comfortable and have much to lose. This makes the rebel guerrilla far more formidable then that government soldier. The rebellion is crushed with a scorched earth policy which alarms a plantation owner. This also causes the forced relocation of impoverished mountain villagers, whose starvation has probably not been well-known until this point. Delores is captured. While his fate is being decided, a soldier suggests that Delores might not be executed, but jailed, and one day, freed. Delores then pontificates that true freedom is never given freely&ndash;it can only be taken by force. At the same time the governor is discussing which form of execution they will use to dispatch the rebel leader. Walker convinces him not to turn him into a martyr but a traitor. When the governor presents Delores with a bribe to leave Queimada forever, the offer is sardonically refused. The next morning, when Walker sees soldiers building a gallows, there is little doubt as for whom it will be used. He helps one of the soldiers make the noose, then proceeds to find Delores unguarded, and cuts his bonds. When Delores meets Walker's instructions on how to escape with stone silence and inaction, he is left to guess the reason for it. Walker's best guess is that it is a kind of ""revenge"".As Walker is preparing to leave the island, he is approached by someone from behind who greets him with the same line that Delores greeted him when he first arrived on Queimada. Walker turns around with a smile, expecting someone whom he should know is dead, but his expression changes when their eyes meet. Walker is then knifed in the belly, and collapses."

In the end, he uses ingenuity instead. McCullough is ""passing through on my way to Australia"" when he takes a job in a gold rush town. After a startling display of marksmanship, he immediately arrests the youngest son of the evil landowner (Danby). A battle of hired guns begins as McCullough continues to tame the town and defeat the gunslingers with a combination of skill and wit.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> A frontier town in the Old West springs up almost literally overnight when the rather klutzy and hotheaded Prudy Perkins discovers gold in a grave during a funeral. Her father Olly becomes mayor of the new settlement. He and the other members of the town council bemoan the twin facts that the place has become a drunken round-the-clock free-for-all, and that in order to ship out all the gold they are mining, they must pay a hefty fee to the Danbys, a family of ranchers/bandits who control the only route out of town. Most people are too busy digging to take time out to be sheriff, and those who are willing to put down their shovel quickly die.This all changes with the arrival in town of Jason McCullough, a calm and hyper-competent man from ""back East"" who is passing through town ""on his way to Australia."" While in the town saloon, he sees young Joe Danby gun a man down, essentially for fun. Needing money after discovering the town's ruinious rate of inflation, McCullough demonstrates his uncanny firearms ability to the mayor and town council, and becomes the new sheriff. He breaks up a street brawl and while at the Perkins house meets Prudy under (for her) mortifyingly embarrassing circumstances. McCullough then arrests Joe and tosses him in the town jail, which has everything a sheriff needs - except iron bars for the cell doors and windows. McCullough keeps the none-too-bright Joe ""imprisoned"" through the use of a chalk line, some dribbles of red paint, and applied psychology.In the process of all this, McCullough acquires a semi-willing deputy in the form of the extremely scruffy Jake, who was previously nothing more than the ""town character."" The arrest ignites the wrath of the patriarch of the Danby family; while the rest of the town immediately quiets down under McCullough's reign, ""Pa"" mounts various efforts to get Joe out of jail. None of them work and he then brings in a string of hired guns, who are equally unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Prudy spars romantically with McCullough, McCullough and Jake go on an unsuccessful search for gold, and, much to Joe's relief, bars are finally installed in the jail.The climax of the film sees Pa Danby summoning scores of his relatives to launch an all-out assault. The sheriff's first impulse is to just leave town and resume his trip to Australia, but when Prudy expresses her sincere approval of this sensible idea, he announces that it sounds cowardly and decides to stay. The rest of the townfolk announce their disapproval of his new plan, and officially vote to not help in any way. Thus the Danby mob rides in faced only by McCullough, Jake and Prudy. After a lengthy gunfight, McCullough bluffs his way to victory using hostage Joe and the cannon mounted in the center of town. As the Danbys are all marched off to jail, the cannon fires, smashing the town brothel and scattering the resident prostitutes and visting civic leaders. McCullough makes his peace with the townfolk, he and Prudy get engaged, and he carries her home. In a closing monologue, Jake directly informs the audience that they get married and McCullough goes on to become governor of the state, while he, Jake, becomes sheriff and then ""one of the most beloved characters in western folklore."""

The job is to steal four million dollars worth of gold arriving in Italy from China. Charlie's job needs financing, so he goes to Mr. Bridger (a Mafia-type boss) who is in prison (Charlie has to break in). In Italy, a clever plan is used to distract the authorities, while the raiders make their get-away in three Minis. This leads to a car chase sequence through Italian streets, buildings, rivers, sewers, highways, and rooftops, which lasts for several minutes.—Rob Hartill A Lamborghini Miura drives through the Italian Alps, enters a tunnel, crashes and explodes. A bulldozer pulls the remains from the tunnel and dumps them down a steep alpine gorge. Some time later dapper mobster Charlie Croker (Caine) is released from prison. He soon meets with the widow (Goldoni) of his friend and fellow thief Roger Beckermann (Brazzi), victim of the Miura crash. She gives Croker her husband's plans for the robbery that attracted the attention of the Italian Mafia. The plans outline a way to rob the payroll of Turin-based automaker Fiat, and spirit it out of Italy.Croker decides to continue the plan despite the risks, but needs a large, well-equipped gang. He breaks into jail to meet Mr Bridger (Coward), a criminal who runs a gangland empire from prison. Croker explains ""the Italian Job"" but Bridger dismisses the plan out of hand, and indeed orders Croker be given ""a good going-over"" for disturbing his privacy.Bridger changes his mind shortly after, when it is announced that China is delivering a consignment of gold to Turin, as down-payment to Fiat for the building of a car factory. With this backing, Croker assembles a group including computer expert Professor Peach (Hill), electronics handler Birkinshaw (Emney) and several getaway drivers. The plan calls for Peach to infect Turin's computerised traffic control to create a paralyzing traffic jam that will prevent the police from recapturing the gold. Three Mini Cooper Ss, able to navigate the gridlock in unconventional ways, will follow Beckermann's route through Turin to evacuate the gold.After planning and training, Croker and crew set out for Turin. Mafia boss Altabani (Raf Vallone) is waiting at an Alpine pass with a front-end loader. It damages their two Jaguar E-Types and flips Croker's Aston Martin DB4 into the gorge, but Croker talks their way out of being killed by promising the Italian community in Britain will suffer reprisals if anything happens to them. He gathers the gang and has Peach load his guerrilla software into the traffic control computer the night before the heist. The next day Birkinshaw jams the closed circuit television that monitors traffic, just before Peach's software goes off and the city comes to a horn-honking standstill. The gang converge on the gold convoy, overpower the guards, pull the armoured car into the entrance hall of the Museo Egizio, and lock the doors.Inside, the gang transfer the gold to the Minis. Mafioso Altabani recognises that ""If they planned this [traffic] jam, then they must have planned a way out of it.""

On their way to Switzerland on a winding mountain road, the celebration grows raucous as beer flows. When driver Big William sends the coach into a skid, the back of the bus is left teetering over a cliff and the gold slides towards the rear doors. As Croker attempts to reach the gold, it slips further, and the audience is left not knowing whether the coach, its contents, or its occupants survivea literal cliffhanger. Croker's last line is ""Hang on a minute, lads, I've got a great idea! Err..."" The camera zooms out, still showing the bus on the edge of the cliff as the credits roll."

A liberated young schoolteacher at an Edinburgh girls' school in the period between the two world wars, instructs her girls on the ways of life. Ignoring the more mundane subjects, she teaches them of love, politics and art. Her affairs with two male teachers become known and she finds herself fighting to keep her job. She believes that she can always count on the one hundred percent support of her favorite pupils, but one of them does not feel that Miss Jean Brodie (Dame Maggie Smith) is in her ""prime"" anymore. No longer swayed by her teacher's eloquence, she begins to learn about life and love herself.—Rhino <rhino@blueyonder.co.uk> Marcia Blaine is a conservative private girls' school in Edinburgh. Amongst its staff is flamboyant Jean Brodie (Dame Maggie Smith), who has a romantic view of everything she experiences, including the politics of such leaders asBenito MussoliniandFrancisco Franco. As she sees herself as a teacher first and foremost, she wants to impart as much of her self to her eleven and twelve-year-old students, but especially to her ""set"", the small group of girls who she finds special. She almost feels that she can preordain her students' futures, especially those of her set, and as such, she has the loyalty of those girls. In the 1932/33 school year, when thirty-something Miss Brodie considers herself in the prime of her life and as such has more of her experience to impart, she has amongst her set: Sandy (Pamela Franklin), the insightful one; Jenny (Diane Grayson), the pretty romantic; literary Monica (Shirley Steedman); and timid, stuttering orphan Mary McGregor (Jane Carr), who accepts the guidance of anyone who will provide it to her. Miss Brodie is at odds with most of the other staff, but especially the strict head mistress, Emmeline Mackay (Celia Johnson), not only because Miss Brodie does not teach the prescribed curriculum, but because of what Miss Mackay sees as Miss Brodie's improper attitude on life which she brings into her classroom. Miss Mackay's mission is to fire Miss Brodie, despite Miss Brodie having tenure. That year, Miss Brodie begins a relationship with the school's somewhat conservative music teacher, Gordon Lowther (Gordon Jackson), although she is still attracted to the school's married art teacher, Teddy Lloyd (Robert Stephens), with whom she had an affair and who still loves her. Her set are aware of what goes on in most of Miss Brodie's life as they spend most of their time with her, even Miss Brodie's weekends with Mr. Lowther at his seaside home in Cramond. They are, however, unaware of certain secrets, such as her affair with and continued attraction to Mr. Lloyd. Over the years of their lives at Marcia Blaine, this specific set of girls will have a profound effect on Miss Brodie by their actions, even if she cannot or does not out of choice see those effects.—Huggo Jean Brodie (Dame Maggie Smith) is a dedicated, if eccentric, teacher at an all-girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930s. She has little time for the approved curriculum and rather teaches ""her girls"" her own romanticized, fantasist view of history, the arts, and the world in general. She is a strong supporter of Mussolini and with the on-set of the Spanish Civil War, Franco. She pushes her girls to excel in what she perceives to be their strengths: Monica (Shirley Steedman) will act in plays; Mary McGregor (Jane Carr) will overcome her stutter and make them all proud; Jenny (Diane Grayson) will be painted many times and will be a great lover; and Sandy (Pamela Franklin) will use her intellect and and insight and be a great spy. Sandy realizes the dangerous game Miss Brodie is playing and after one of the other girls is killed, sets out to stop her.—garykmcd Based onMuriel Spark's best-selling novel, the film The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie earned a Best Actress Oscar for its star,Maggie Smith, in 1969. The theme song, ""Jean"" written byRod McKuen, was also nominated for a Best Song Academy Award. An inspiration to the young girls she teaches and a challenge to the 1932 Edinburgh school who retains her services, Jean Brodie (Smith) espouses her wisdom on art and music, defends fascism, and otherwise encourages fiercely independent thinking in her students. As she engages in ongoing battles with the school's rigid heads and bewilders two men in love with her, Miss Brodie also faces the biggest trial of her life when her career and livelihood become threatened. In 1932 Miss Jean Brodie, a middle-aged spinster, teaches at Edinburgh's exclusive Marcia Blaine School. A romantic devoted to art and music, as well as a fascist sympathizer, Miss Brodie belittles those who do not share her enthusiasms. From her students she recruits a coterie, including the attractive Jenny; the impressionable Mary McGregor, a wealthy orphan; and the subtle Sandy, who proves to be her nemesis. Courted by Lowther, a retiring music instructor at whose ancestral home she spends the weekends, Miss Brodie carries on an affair with Lloyd, an earthy art teacher and the father of a large Catholic family. Miss Brodie's antagonist is the humorless headmistress, Miss MacKay, who repeatedly attempts to dismiss her. Jealous of Miss Brodie's eulogies to Jenny's beauty and stung by the teacher's indifferent prediction that she will make a superior secret service agent, Sandy takes Lloyd as her lover. When she discovers that his portrait of her resembles Miss Brodie, she breaks with the artist, assuring him that he is an aging mediocrity. Learning that Mary's brother has run off to Spain, Miss Brodie assumes that he has joined Franco's forces and encourages her to join him. En route to Spain, her train is bombed and Mary is killed. At a school convocation Lloyd informs Miss Brodie of Lowther's impending marriage to the chemistry teacher, Miss Lockhart. Shortly thereafter, Miss Brodie is dismissed for propagandizing in the classroom. Stunned, she asks Sandy who has betrayed her. Sandy spitefully proclaims her liaison with Lloyd and reveals her treachery, citing as justification the absurdity of Mary's death."

The Illustrated Man,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064473/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1930s, a psychotic drifter who's after the mystery woman who covered his whole body in illustrations that foresee distant future shows three of them (The Veldt, The Long Rain and The Last Night of the World) to a mesmerized traveler. The Illustrated Man is classic Bradbury, a collection of eighteen startling visions of humankind's destiny, unfolding across a canvas of decorated skin, visions as keen as the tattooist's needle and as colorful as the inks that indelibly stain the body. The images, ideas, sounds and scents that abound in this phantasmagoric sideshow are provocative and powerful: the mournful cries of celestial travelers cast out cruelly into a vast space of stars and blackness, the sight of gray dust settling over a forgotten outpost on a road that leads nowhere, the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing. Here living cities take their vengeance, technology awakens the most primal natural instincts, Martian invasions are foiled by the good life and the glad hand, and dreams are carried aloft in junkyard rockets.—Stig Ohara Just as the original book is an anthology of science fiction stories, the Illustrated Man movie has a framing device to connect the fragmented story vignettes that are told. A young hobo falls in with an experienced traveler who at times frightens and entices him. The senior hobo(Rod Stieger) is covered from head to toe by tattoo illustrations that both enrich and curse him. He warns the young man not to stare too closely at them for too long, as they seem to come alive and portray tales. Each one in turn plays out a science fiction tale, a morality play, some bitter, some sweet, some perplexing. The movie reuses the same three principal actors in every story vignette, making it a bizarre, confusing task to try to re-identify each as their role changes from tale to tale. There is no connecting thread here, save for the continuing framing story of the young man becoming entranced by the illustrations. The older hobo claims he is searching for the woman who tattooed him to this extent, but it is unclear if she is real, a phantom, or an invention of his somewhat disturbed mind. By the time we get the entire tale of how the tattoos came to be, Rod has become romantically involved with the female tattoo artist. There is some suggestion that she has made a mark upon his soul by living with him for so long. But suddenly, she is gone, vanished, and he is forever searching for his lost love, his muse, his devil woman who has cursed him to live like this and thrown him to the hard, cruel world. Shocked and driven to the point of madness himself, the young man attempts to crush the old hobo's skull with a rock, and then flees himself, having now become the target of the old hobo's pursuit. There is no resolution to this, only an endless chase that continues...—Kirk G A young man is introduced to the hobo life by an odd, completely tattooed man. The tattoos seem to come alive and can drive a man mad. The old hobo pursues both the woman who tattooed him in his dreams and the young man who attempts to kill him.—Kirk G In this Sci-Fi anthology based on short stories by famous Sci-Fi and horror author Ray Bradbury, a man meets a strange woman and ends up having his whole body covered in tattoos or illustrations, as he calls them. He meets a curious traveler and agrees to explain to him the meaning behind three of there illustration, which all happen to tell about the future. The first story is called ""The Veldt"" and follows a couple who's worried over the fact that their kids are spending all their time in an African savanna created by their incredibly realistic home virtual reality simulator.

Downhill Racer,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064253/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Quietly cocky Robert Redford joins U.S. ski team as downhill racer and clashes with the team's coach, played by Gene Hackman. Lots of good skiing action leading to an exciting climax. David Chappellet is a mean-spirited skier, who profits from another skier's injury to gain a spot on the American Olympic team. His roommate sums up his goals when he observes of David, ""He's not for the team, and he never will be""; but precisely who the David is that David is so fiendishly striving for we're never to learn. He develops a short-lived relationship with Carole Stahl, a glamorous European woman even more capricious than himself. Chappellet's identity trouble are exacerbated by the fact that he is an ""Event"" as well as a personality; and more astute minds than his own have difficulty where the one leaves off and the other takes over. Director Michael Ritchie's (""The Candidate"") feature film debut.—alfiehitchie From the small rural community of Idaho Springs, Colorado, Dave Chappellet has just joined the US men's downhill ski team, which has little respect from the traditional powerhouses from Europe as the US only has one seeded skier, Johnny Creech. Dave believes the team's head coach, Claire, is not looking after his best interest, such as not fighting to get him higher start numbers in races. Regardless of this and other external obstacles which Dave believes are the only things between him and the podium, he is able to achieve skiing success which leads to eventually being among that first seed with Johnny. Although Dave does ultimately win races, he DNF just as many, as he has an all or nothing approach. Conversely, Claire has a love/hate relationship with Dave, who he knows is talented and winning races will ultimately bring in much needed funding to the team as a whole, but his self-absorbed and arrogant attitude has alienated himself from the rest of the team and created team disharmony. Dave's attitude is borne out of his distant relationship with his farmer father, who does not understand why Dave is not pursuing a paying job, and an inferiority complex growing up without money like his teammates. That arrogance is also demonstrated in his personal life, in how he treats Lena, his girl back home, and how he pursues Carole Stahl, an employee of ski manufacturer Machet, who is wooing the American ski team to use his skis. Two years in Dave's journey is shown, chasing the ultimate prize of the gold medal in the men's downhill at the next Olympics.—Huggo Comments by Actor / WriterRoy C. PetersonThis is a skier's movie. I only wish there were more ski movies. I've seen this one many times and enjoy it every time. Robert Redford did all his own skiing for this and must be especially fond and proud of this particular film.The character Redford plays, David Chappellet, is a very bleak and grimly determined individual (Remember Bruno in The Blue Max?) When David goes home to visit his father we see where he got his emotional approach to living. Their conversations are so minimalist as to be nearly autistic. From their viewpoint probably just seen as practical minded and verbally economical. But I don't care what anybody says. There was something I liked about this character and found myself rooting for him. I was happy when he won at the end. What else would there have been to this story if he hadn't won? To love your work and to never betray it, whatever else happens, is one of the greatest gifts that life can give."

My Night at Maud's,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064612/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A devout Catholic man's rigid principles are challenged during a one-night stay with Maud, a divorced woman with an outsize personality. 34-year-old engineer Jean-Louis has just started a new job in Clermont. He lives a relatively solitary life not knowing anyone in town except his work colleagues, and he has made a conscious decision that they should not become his de facto friends just because they work together. He also chooses not to socialize because of his situation and needing to make the long daily commute to/from Ceyrat, where he currently lives. He has had his fair share of women during his adult life and now chooses to adhere most closely to his Catholic beliefs in approaching romantic and sexual relationships with women with the sole goal of love and marriage. He keeps seeing a pretty blonde at Mass on Sunday mornings and without knowing her or even talking to her, he believes that this woman is destined to be his wife. He has been reading the writings of Blaise Pascal and finding the mixture of mathematics and Catholicism just what he needs to be reading and applying to his life. One day just before Christmas, he runs into Vidal, an old college friend he hasn't seen in 14 years, now a Philosophy professor at the college. In the course of getting reacquainted over the next couple of days, Vidal invites Jean-Louis over to his friend Maud's apartment the day after Christmas. Maud is a recently-divorced pediatrician, the mother of young-adolescent daughter Marie. Much of Jean-Louis, Vidal, and Maud's discussion that evening uses Pascal as a jumping-off point, veering into his philosophies in relation to sex and love; Vidal and Maud, being atheists, have a different view than Jean-Louis. This night, which Jean-Louis learns was not by accident on Vidal's part, has the potential to reshape his life as he would have to admit his attraction to Maud, who is not the theoretical of the perfect mate for him. If he does stay true to his thoughts of the blonde, he could find that a happily-ever-after with her is not a guarantee, and she might have her own baggage.—Huggo Convinced he has found his soulmate in a crowded church during Sunday Mass, devout Catholic and unmarried engineer Jean-Louis follows young Françoise, an attractive blonde perfect stranger. Then, one evening, Jean-Louis runs into estranged old friend Vidal, and as one thing leads to another while discussing the nature of politics and religion, the solitary engineer finds himself having to stay the night with Maud, a beautiful, sophisticated divorcee. However, as their late-night conversation turns into a thoughtful philosophical discussion, the question remains: can Jean-Louis resist temptation for the sake of lovely Françoise, the kindred spirit he has never met?—Nick Riganas The narrator (Jean-Louis), a devout Catholic, moves to a provincial town and vows to marry Francoise, a pretty blonde he notices at Mass. Vidal, an old school friend, invites him to visit the recently-divorced Maud, and the narrator ends up staying the night, having philosophical discussions in her bedroom. The next morning the narrator engineers a meeting with Francoise.—Will Gilbert"

Fangs of the Living Dead,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062957/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A beautiful virgin inherits a castle, but when she arrives at it, she finds that the inhabitants include a strange nobleman and a bevy of beautiful women she suspects may be vampires. ""Malenka, the Vampire's Niece"" is a 1969 horror film that was written and directed by Spanish director Amando de Ossorio;. Sylvia is delighted to discover that she has inherited the title of countess, and also inherited a castle located in the country. She travel to the castle, and once there, she stops at a local inn for a drink, where she announces her destination and relation to the castle's inhabitants; this horrifies the towns people. Unswayed by their reactions, Sylvia arrives at the castle and meets her uncle, Count Walbrooke, and beds down for the night. She is later awakened by the maid servant Blinka, who warns her that Walbrooke is a century old vampire that means her harm. Will Sylvia survive?—Paul Gerard Kennedy Just two weeks from her marriage, model Sylvia Morelle [Anita Ekberg] receives a letter from her Uncle, Count Walbrook [Julián Ugarte], informing her that her mother has died and that she has inherited a castle and the title of Countess.
Consequently, Sylvia leaves her fiancé, Dr Piero Luciani [John Hamilton] with his friend Max [Guy Roberts], in Rome while she goes to Castle Walbrook to sign papers and check out her good fortune.
However, the afternoon she arrives at the castle, her uncle is not there to greet her, and she is told by his Manservant Vladis [Fernando Bilbao] that the count never rises before 10 PM. At precisely 10 PM, Sylvia's uncle appears. For an ""uncle"", he looks very young, and Sylvia can't help but notice the chill in his cheeks. The first thing he does is to show Sylvia an oil painting portrait of her grandmother Malenka and point out how much alike they look (except that Sylvia is blonde and Malenka has dark hair).
Later that night, after Sylvia has gone to bed, she is awakened by a dark-haired woman who calls herself Velinka [Adriana Ambesi] and who tells Sylvia that her ""uncle"" is not her uncle, and explains how he had locked Sylvia's mother in her bedroom each night, and warns that he wants Sylvia to do something for him that her mother had refused to do. As Velinka bends down to ""kiss"" Sylvia's neck, the count interrupts them and, angrily, escorts Velinka to the dungeon where he proceeds to whip her (off camera).
Next day, when Sylvia confronts her uncle, he tells her the family curse: Grandma Malenka was a witch. It was her mysterious alchemy rituals and her search for immortality that scared the villagers, so they burned her at the stake (flashback in sepia). They didn't know, however, that Malenka was successful in her search. In fact, Sylvia's uncle claims to be Malenka's husband and now lives on as an immortal nosferatu, a non-dead.
Uncle commands that Sylvia cancels her plan to wed Piero, but Piero isn't about to be put off so easily. He and Max travel to Walbrook, but they are turned away at the castle by Vladis. They go back to the village inn where Piero is asked by Freya Ziemsen [Rosanna Yanni] to examine her brunette sister, Bertha Ziemsen [Diana Lorys], who has lately been feeling unwell. It's a mild case of anemia, says Piero, and he writes her a prescription for iron.
Later, following a visit from the Count, Bertha is found dead by her sister Freya. Dr. Hörbiger [Carlos Casaravilla], the local physician and a drunkard, points out the two holes in Bertha's neck and tells Piero the local legends about Malenka. Of course, Piero doesn't believe in vampires, and the next day Bertha is buried without the usual precautions.
Meanwhile, back at the castle, the count decides to perform the ritual that will make Sylvia immortal. First, the Count slices his arm and fills a chalice with his blood. Then he bodes Sylvia to drink it, but Sylvia refuses. As the Count is about to pour it down her throat, Bertha comes calling. As the Count is distracted by Bertha, promising to call her next day, Sylvia dumps out the blood and makes her getaway.
Helpful Velinka shows Sylvia a way out of the castle. Sylvia runs to the village inn and into the arms of Piero, but when she tells him that she saw Bertha, he doesn't believe her until one of the villagers wanders by and says that he also saw Bertha.
Dr. Hörbiger advises that they must drive a wooden stake through Bertha's heart, so that night he, Piero, and Max go to the cemetery to await Bertha's awakening. Meanwhile, Vladis comes to the inn and forces Sylvia to return to the castle with him.
When Piero hears that Sylvia has been taken, he, Max, and Dr. Hörbiger pay the Count a visit, but Sylvia tells Piero to go away, explaining that she is bound by her heritage to remain at the castle. When Piero confronts the Count, the Count has him placed in chains and then explains his plan to have Sylvia declared insane by virtue of her believing herself to be a vampire, her Uncle to be over 150 years old, and then killing Piero in order to drink his blood.
Seemingly in a trance and obeying her uncle's commands, Sylvia approaches Piero to drink his blood. Velinka suddenly enters the room, announcing that none of this is true. Bertha attacks Velinka, and, while the Count watches them tussle, Sylvia releases Piero's bonds. Piero punches the Count and sets him afire. The Count ages before his eyes, and Malenka's picture begins to burn.Epilogue: The next morning, Sylvia and Piero prepare to return to Rome. Freya stops Max and tells him that since her sister does not need her anymore, if she can go to Rome with him. Max smiles widely, showing vampire fangs and chases after her.

She was wearing her modeling clothes (which were barely covering her private parts) when admitted. Nookey examines her but cannot resist the sexual innuendos. While taking her x ray, Nookey short circuits the equipment (he was trying to impress Goldie by showing off the capabilities of the equipment, which he did not know how to operate) & nearly brings the hospital down. The hospital electrical equipment was knocked out as a result and it took 24 hours to restore them back to normal.At a staff party, Stoppidge mixes surgical alcohol in Nookey's drinks.

Little known to them, however, is the fact that the miners sister has hired the same salvage team to help her locate her missing brother.—Kevin Steinhauer <K.Steinhauer@BoM.GOV.AU> Astronaut Bill Kemp [James Olson] salvages a broken satellite in space and brings it back on board his small moon lander space craft called Moon Zero Two. He and his fellow astronaut, engineer Karminski [Ori Levy], return to the moon and request landing. The year is 2021 and the moon has been colonized and has a city, a space port and customs checks, just like an airport on Earth, and they have to convince the customs officials they can bring the satellite through. Kemp is a former space hero, the first man to land on Mars, but is now earning a modest living as a salvage pilot. In the pilots' changing rooms, another pilot tries to convince Kemp to re-join the corporation as a commercial pilot but he is not interested.Also passing through the space port are Hubbard [Warren Mitchell], a wealthy businessman, and Clem Taplin [Catherine Schell]. Clem comes looking for Kemp because she knows he is a space pilot who has been to the far side of the moon. She is looking for her brother Wally, who had been mining a claim on the far side of the moon, but has disappeared. Kemp does not know him but shows her around the facilities that have been built to make the moon habitable.Kemp goes to his suite where he lives with Liz [Adrienne Corri], a law enforcement officer. She gives Kemp an ultimatum to give up being a salvage pilot and return to the corporation. He goes to the bar where he has a drink with Karminski. Kemp is approached by Hubbard's assistant Harry [Bernard Bresslaw] who persuades Kemp at gunpoint to meet with Hubbard. Hubbard wants to hire Kemp to retrieve an asteroid. Another of Hubbard's assistants, Whitsun [Dudley Foster], explains to Kemp that the asteroid is largely made up of six thousand tons of sapphire.

Whitsun and Harry are going with Kemp and Karminski. Whitsun will help navigate to the asteroid and explains the plan for getting the asteroid onto the moon, by attaching rockets to the asteroid to first bring it into orbit around the moon and then guide it down to the moon's surface. Meanwhile, back in moon city, Clem continues to try and find any information she can about her brother.Two days later, Kemp and the others land on the asteroid and attach rocket engines to it to redirect the path of the asteroid into orbit around the moon. Kemp stays on the asteroid after the others return to the ship to ensure the rockets ignite. He releases himself just in time once they do before the velocity is too great for him to escape.They return to moon city where Kemp meets Clem again in the bar. Kemp explains her brother would have had two years to mine his claim on the far side of the moon. He offers to take her there but is overheard by Harry who does not like Kemp's plan. A fight breaks out in the bar between them and several other guests also become involved, but Kemp gets away just as Liz arrives.Kemp and Karminski take Clem to a base on the far side of the moon in their space ship. At the far side base, Kemp and Clem hire a space buggy from Smith [Joby Blanshard], the base commander, to continue the rest of their journey on land to the location of Wally's claim. When they arrive there is no sign of life so they don space suits to go and investigate. They find Wally's body and discover he died because he had run out of oxygen while out looking for nickel. As they return to the space buggy, they are attacked by three armed men who open fire. They escape a short distance in the buggy, then abandon it and lie in wait for the attackers. Kemp manages to kill two and shoot the oxygen tank of the third. Kemp tries to save the third man by giving him one of Wally's oxygen packs but the man dies regardless because it contains something other than oxygen. Kemp concludes Wally must have been murdered. Their own space buggy is damaged so they take the one used by their assailants, but the buggy is faulty and overheats before they can reach the far side base. They escape just before it explodes and are able to walk the remainder of the way to the base.At the base is Liz who has come to investigate Kemp's activities. Kemp confronts Smith the fake oxygen packs and Smith admits he was forced to substitute them with cyanide so that Wally could be disposed of in order for Hubbard's asteroid to be crashed onto the moon at Wally's location. Hubbard, Whitsun and Harry arrive at the base. Liz tries to arrest them but Harry shoots her. Kemp refuses to help Hubbard with the rest of his mission but Hubbard threatens to shoot Clem too, forcing him to comply.They take off to undertake the second stage of the mission to crash the asteroid. Clem argues to Hubbard that such an enormous amount of sapphire will massively reduce its value on Earth because there will be so much sapphire in circulation. Hubbard actually plans to use the sapphire to line rocket engines which will make him rich because it will rapidly help progress space exploration to more distant planets and moons. They land on the asteroid but between them, Kemp, Clem and Karminski kill Harry and Smith. Kemp ignites the rockets on the asteroid before Hubbard and Whitsun can get off, forcing the asteroid to crash into the moon with Hubbard and Whitsun still on it.

Photographer Glen Cannon [Gene O'Shane] and his fiancée, model Liz Arden [Barbara Bishop], are
pleased to find that Glen has inherited Falconroc Castle after the death
of his uncle Thomas. Unfortunately, Falconroc is already inhabited by an
old couple--Count Charles Townsend [Alex D'Arcy] and his wife [Paula Raymond] -- who have been renting the castle for over 60 years. Glen isn't looking forward to dispossessing the
Townsends of their longtime home.Actually, Count Townsend is none other than Count Dracula, and he and
his wife like Falconroc. Their retarded and disfigured strongman Mango [Ray Young]
catches young girls, and their butler George [John Carradine] (whom they saved from the
noose when he was convicted of sacrificing victims to the great god Luna)
chains the girls in the basement and extracts blood for the Townsends to
drink. Now that their old friend JohnnyDavenport (Robert Dix], who has a problem in that he
turns into a psycho killer during the full moon, has broken out of prison
and made it to Falconroc, life is really looking up. The Count has no
intention of moving.What Glen and Liz discover when they arrive at Falconroc is a very
refined and impeccably dressed couple who look much younger than their
years. The Count explains that he simply took over the lease at the death
of his father. When the Count gets around to asking whether Glen would
consider selling Falconroc and Glen refuses because Liz is looking forward
to living there, the Count turns to Johnny, who promises to think up some
way of doing away with the new owners.Liz and Glen spend the night at Falconroc, but Liz is awakened when
she hears a woman screaming. She wakes up Glen and forces him to find out
what's going on, even though Glen thinks it's just a family spat or
someone using an electric toothbrush that short-circuited. The scream came
from downstairs, so they light a candlabra and head for the cellar. When
they run into Mango, they retreat. Then they encounter George, who
explains that the screams were made by a pet toucan.The next morning, Liz and Glen go for a swim in the ocean
[interesting, since Falconroc is in the middle of the Arizona desert].
When Liz and Glen return to the castle, Johnny informs them that the fuel
line on their car is damaged and that a mechanic will take a look at it
tomorrow morning. Consequently, Liz and Glen are invited to dine with the
Townsends that evening.In the meantime, Liz wants to take a look at the noisy toucan, so she
and Glen head down to the cellar. They are horrified to find three girls
in chains. Even more horrifying is when they find the Townsends in the
next room, asleep in coffins. As they back out of the Townsends' bedroom,
they turn to find Johnny, George, and Mango behind them. The three thugs
capture Glen and Liz and place them in chains. Then George awakens the
Townsends and reminds them that tonight is the full moon and the night of
the sacrifice. The Countess informs Ann [Vicki Volante], one of the chained girls, that
she is to be the sacrifice, and the Count tells George to draw up a bill
of sale for the castle. They then all go upstairs to begin the
purification ritual.Two rats and a tarantula come crawling around Liz and Ann, which sets
them to screaming, so Johnny comes back down into the cellar. He releases
Ann and tries to convince her that he's only pretending to be the
Townsends' friend and that he's really going to try to help her get free
because she reminds him of a girl that he almost married. When he starts
to tell her about the girl and takes Ann into his arms, Ann pushes him
away and screams. Johnny slaps her, but he is stopped by George who
informs Johnny that he can never become one of the eternal ones if he
violates the sacrifice.The full moon has risen, and the band of torch-carrying worshippers
with Glen and Liz among them, walk along the beach to a hill where Ann is
tied to a stake and wood for a bonfire has been piled at her feet. George
mouths an offeratory, they light the bonfire, and the fire consumes Ann.
The ceremony over, everyone returns to the castle. Mango takes the two
extra girls back to the cellar while George prepares to serve dinner.
First, they drink a toast to the great God Luna. Liz and Glen notice the
gun sticking out of Johnny's pants. Liz tosses her drink in Johnny's face,
and Glen grabs the gun. He shoots Johnny through the heart, effectively
putting him out of commission. George slinks out of the room, leaving the
Townsends alone, facing Glen's gun. Glen passes the gun to Liz and ties up
the Townsends using the sashes from their robes. Then Glen goes after
George. George has run down to the cellar where he grabs a bullwhip and
tries to stop Glen. Unfortunately for George, when he takes a swing at
Glen with a mace, he accidentally falls down the cellar stairs and is
knocked out.Meanwhile, back upstairs, the Townsends struggle at their ties but
can't get free. Glen comes bounding up the stairs, much to Liz's relief.
It's almost dawn, and the Townsends plead to be put in their coffins. Glen
refuses. As Glen and Liz watch, the Townsends turn to dust, and two bats
fly out the window.Downstairs, Mango has discovered George's body. He takes the mace and
goes upstairs only to find the Townsends turned to dust and Johnny dead.
Mango advances on Liz and Glen. They run outside. Mango follows. Glen and
Liz run up the side of a hill, Liz stumbles, Mango punches Glen and
carries off Liz, kicking and screaming, to the site of last night's
sacrifice. Mango ties Liz to the stake, pours gasoline on her, and lights
a torch. Glen finds an ax laying next to a woodpile and plunges it into
Mango's back. He then pours gasoline on Mango and sets him on fire. Mango
crawls to a cliff and falls to the rocky beach below. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

The story, set in Kansas during the 1920s, covers less than a year in the life of a Black teenager and documents the veritable deluge of events which force him into sudden manhood. The family relationships and enmities, the fears, frustrations, and ambitions of the black teenager in small-town America are explored with a strong statement about human values.—alfiehitchie It's sometime during the 1920s in the town of Cherokee Flats, Kansas. Stemming from their differing backgrounds, Black mid-teens Newt Winger and Marcus Savage take different approaches to life, especially in coexisting in town with white neighbors, many who are inherently racist, something largely taught to them by their parents, and their parents before them. From a loving, supportive family, Newt would like to do the right thing to have a good life, but is often scared to do so. Newt ultimately wants to attend college despite one of his white teachers constantly devaluing him and the other Black students in believing they will amount to nothing more than laborers at best. He must deal with an issue indirectly involving race differences concerning his Black girlfriend, Arcella Jefferson, his first love; and he wants to make amends for stealing apples from the white Kliners' orchard with some other boys, regardless of Mr. Kliner's initial reaction in and of itself being excessive, probably Because black boys were involved. Conversely, Marcus, who has never been shown real love in his life, not even from his abusive widowed father Booker Savage, believes the world, especially the white world, is out to get him, he whose reaction is twice as excessive as any excessive action taken against him. Marcus even believes that Newt is out to get him in quietly not agreeing with the way Marcus deals with his troubles. Newt and Marcus' relationship has the potential to come to an explosive head when Newt clandestinely witnesses a murder, the truth, contrary to the circumstantial evidence, coming to light which could be the match that lights the powder keg of tense race relations in general in town, so Newt must decide whether to come forward with what he saw.—Huggo"

A gutter press contact informs corrupt Commissioner Belli (Franco Nero) that respected lawyer Fontana (Adolfo Celi) wants him to make trouble for English model Sandy Bronson (Delia Boccardo) who is engaged to his son Mino (Maurizio Bonuglia). Fontana is also perturbed about a business deal his son wants to enter into with recording studio owner Romani (Marino Mase). After roughing up Sandy, Belli pays a call on Romani only to discover that the man has been murdered. When Belli's colleague Baldo (Renzo Palmer) questions the doorman of Romani's apartment building, Belli recognizes his description of a female visitor as that of Sandy. They also discover the seemingly important clue of a photograph of a naked woman whose face is obscured because the corner of the photo is torn off. When Belli confronts Sandy, she reveals that she had been to bed with Romani and that Mino had found out. When Baldo arrives to question Sandy, Belli agrees to not reveal that she had keys to Romani's apartment if she does not mention that he has ever come to visit her. Naturally, Fontana is not too happy that his son might become a potential suspect in Romani's murder. Mino's doting stepmother Vera (Florinda Bolkan) was all for Mino investing with Romani, so Belli questions her (she even strips off to reveal that she is not the woman in the photograph found in Romani's apartment). Sandy swears that she is not the woman in the photo (although she does not prove it in the same manner) but claims that Mino's photographer friend Claude (Roberto Bisacco) was looking for a negative and questioned her since she had been to bed with Romani. Belli roughs up Claude, but does not find the negative so he pays a visit to French singer Emmanuelle (Susanna Martinkova) who Mino introduced to Romani. Belli picks up quickly on her drug problem, but that's a dead end since her doctor supplier (also introduced by Mino) met with a sudden fatal accident the week before. Belli plays Russian Roulette with Sandy in his car (denting and dinging several other cars on the road along the way) and she admits that she was the girl in the photo and that she and Mino went looking for it and both discovered Romani dead. She also admits that she does not want to marry Mino; rather, she wanted Fontana to buy her off so she could provide for her layabout boyfriend back in England. If blackmail was not the motive for Romani's death, then why was he killed?"

Word of the iceberg has made the national news, and Fu Manchu has been sending out multiple (untraceable) messages to the world leaders, calling for their surrender, or else he will freeze the oceans of the world. His ultimatum gives 2 weeks to comply.Meanwhile, in Istanbul, Fu Manchu's daughter, Lin Tang (Tsai Chin), meets with Omar Pashu (José Manuel Martín), and his assistant, Lisa (Rosalba Neri).Tang outlines a plan to take over the governor's castle in Anatolia, with the promise that he can have the governor's supply of Opium.As Pashu has direct contacts with the governor, he sends Lisa to see the governor, using the entry to allow Fu Manchu's men to enter the castle, and execute the governor. It is then that Fu Manchu reveals he has double-crossed Omar Pachu, by killing Pachu's henchmen, and imprisoning Lisa in the castle's dungeon. To feign suspicion, a false message is sent out that bandits attempted to attack the Governor's castle, and were dealt with.Back at the Home Office, Smith and Petrie continue to try and decipher how Fu Manchu could carry out his plan.

The tribe had little livelihood other than selling antiquities, putting them in conflict with the Egyptian government's Antiquities Organization.

Filmed in classical Arabic, with a musical score by the great Italian composer Mario Nascimbene.

Popi,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064827/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Puerto Rican widower concocts an extraordinary plan for making a better life for his two motherless sons. Abraham, a Puerto Rican single parent with two boys, is becoming very worried about them living in their rundown neighborhood when one day he notices that Cubans who escape are lionized and given exceptional benefits. He thinks up a plot to have his sons washed ashore as Cuban immigrants who will be adopted by rich Anglos.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Of Puerto Rican descent, widowed Abraham Rodriguez lives with his two sons, 11-year-old Junior and 9-year-old Luis, in a one-room unit in a Spanish Harlem tenement. He works three manual-labor jobs to provide the basics, which leaves him little quality time with his boys. As a result, the boys are often left to their own devices and get into trouble as they find creative ways to survive in the rough neighborhood. Abraham's girlfriend Lupe wants the two of them to get married and the four of them to move to Brooklyn to eke out a better life for them all, something Abraham is reluctant to do; he doesn't want to lose his connection to his Puerto Rican roots, plus he wants an even better life for his sons. He has a plan that stems from the reverence he sees that American society has for Cuban immigrants in their escape to freedom. Without telling anyone until the last minute, even the boys and Lupe, he plans to set the boys off in a small boat off the coast of Miami Beach--filled with background stories of Cuban life that he collected from Cuban immigrants in his neighborhood--so that ultimately the authorities will pick them up as Cuban refugees and get them adopted by a wealthy family so they will live in luxury. He also plans to not leave Miami until he knows that the boys have been rescued. What happens with this plan is affected by the love Abraham has for his boys in wanting that better life for them?—Huggo Popi, a.k.a. Abraham Rodriguez, a Puerto Rican widower struggling to raise his two young sons amid the squalor of New York's Spanish Harlem, has two aims in life: one is to marry Lupe, his warmhearted, voluptuous girl friend, and move to Brooklyn; but before he can do this, Popi feels obligated to realize his other aim -- assuring his sons a decent future. For years he has managed to provide for them by simultaneously working several jobs, but in his mind has always lurked the fear that he would one day lose them to the ghetto. And it is not long before this fear is realized: he learns that his sons are telling school friends that their father is the gangster brother of a notorious underworld figure. The problem preoccupies him, but the solution presents itself one evening while he is catering a banquet for Cuban refugees. Popi is a shrewd man, and his experience has taught him that America is more altruistic toward political refugees than toward the common poor. His scheme is to set his sons adrift in a rowboat somewhere off the coast of Miami, Florida, in the hope that they will be spotted, taken for Cuban refugees, and rescued. Following rowing sessions in Central Park and some lessons in motorboat handling on the East River, Popi reveals his plan to the boys. Despite their reluctance to leave New York (they even try running away), Popi has his way, and the family soon arrives in Florida. After stealing a boat, Popi instructs his sons to take the boat out until the fuel runs out, jettison the motor, and start rowing back. The boys have qualms but nevertheless obey. With the scheme underway, Popi attempts to alert the Coast Guard but fails. Believing that all is lost, he is near suicide when a report comes over the radio concerning the rescue of ""two brave Cuban boys."" The two are rushed to a hospital in critical condition, suffering from dehydration and sunburn. Thousands of well-wishers send flowers and toys; adoption offers pour in, and the boys receive an invitation to visit the White House. When Popi, variously disguised, finally reaches his sons, they try to make him see how they value his love far more than the security that adoption by wealthy parents would provide. He tries to reason with them, but his noisy protests alert the hospital staff. When he tries to flee, the boys follow, and the entire hoax is exposed. The young boys are overjoyed as a somewhat bewildered Popi returns with them to the old neighborhood."

In 1599 Italy, Beatrice Cenci is the teenage daughter of the crazy landowner and nobleman Francesco Cenci whom he keeps his daughter locked up in the dungeon of his castle for his plaything, sexually abusing her when he feels like it. Beatrice then plots with her stepmother, her besotted servant Olimpio, as well as a local bandit, named Catalano, to plan Francesco's murder. Italy, 1599. The entire Cenci family awaits their fates on the morning of their execution for murder. Frequent flashbacks show reason why.Four years earlier: Francesco Cenci (George Wilson) is a rich landowner and nobleman, but is hated by everyone, including his entire family. He's a vicious, conniving, cynical tyrant of the household and a domestic abuser to his wife and children. He also has made numerous enemies within the close-knit halls of the Catholic Church and the state. Francesco's beautiful teenage daughter, Beatrice (Adrienne Laurussa), confides in her mother that intends to take the cloth and enter a convent, as much to escape from her father as for spiritual reasons. When Francesco hears about this, he is enraged and reacts by imprisoning Beatrice in the bowels of the Cenci castle, observing that there is little difference between dungeon and cloister.Flashing forward back to the present, it is announced that the Cenci patriarch has been killed in a fall from the battlements, an accident which looks suspiciously like murder. Suspicion closes around Beatrice's lover Olimpio (Tomas Milian), who is taken into custody and brutally tortured for information about the slaying.Flashing back in time, Beatrice is released from her father's dungeon after nearly a year in solitary confinment by Francesco to celebrate news that her two older brothers where killed in war. Beatrice defies the atmosphere the revelry demanded by her abrasive and callous father and attends the party wearing a black funeral dress. A little later, Francisco confronts Beatrice in an upstairs bedroom, and the specter of incest emerges. Beatrice's father drunkenly rips off his daughters black dress and stands swaying over her, dripping sweat into Beatrices exposed midriff. It is finally revealed the motive for Francesco's death: he was raping his grieving daughter.Beatrice changes drastically after this horror. She coerces her besotted servant, Olimpio, with sexual favors, and embroils him in her desire for revenge. Olimpio is told to seek the assistantce of the local bandit, Catalano (Pedro Sanchez) to exact revenge on her father. Olimpio is not told for what reason he is planning the murder; it is enough for him that his lady lover requires it. When the time comes as Francesco Cenci sleeps, the bandit ducks out, revealing that he is a killer ""in reputation only."" Olimpio, with a knife raised to stab Francesco, also suddenly backs out saying that he cannot stomach the task of killing. In desperation, Beatrice snatches the knife from Olimpio, and does the deed herself, stabbing her father in the eye, while Olimpio restrains the waking victim before he expires.Beatrice is vengefully aglow, but Olimpio is stricken with guilt, and wipes his bloody hands on the bedstead. Beatrice calls in her stepmother to help her clean up the mess and gets her little brother (Antonio Casagrande) to help her carry the dead Francesco onto the ramparts of the castle to throw him off to make it look like an accident. Beatrice uses their silent compliance to ensure future denials.Flashing forward back to the present, the whole Cenci family is implicated in the murder either as participants or accessories and under Church law, they are condemned to death. The bandit Catalano is murdered by soldiers when he attempts to escape after he attempts to kill one soldier on horseback and in return, is lanced to death. Cardinal Lanciani (Raymond Pellegrin) attempts to wring a statement implicated Beatrice from Olimpio, who has been repeatedly tortured to extract his confession about the Cenci family's involvment.

Sometime in the future, the Canadian Academy for Erotic Inquiry is investigating the theories of parapsychologist Luther Stringfellow. Seven young adults volunteer to submit to a form of brain surgery that removes their power of speech but increases their power for telepathic communication. An unseen group of students observes the results. As the experiment progresses, Stringfellow's theories come to fruition. Later, aphrodisiacs and various other drugs are introduced to the subjects to expose an inherent polymorphous perversity. (SPOILER ALERT!) In the end, they are isolated from each other, provoking antagonism and violence between them, which results in two suicides.—Daeha Ko <dko@u.washington.edu> A helicopter lands in a courtyard outside a large postmodern office building. A man wearing a dark cloak emerges. There is no dialogue or soundtrack except for the voice-over of a narrator. The cloaked new arrival is one of eight ""Category A subjects who underwent pattern brain surgery."" A program developed within he Canadian Academy for Erotic Enquirey's ""organic computer dialectic system."" This confers telepathic ability b y a process of ""biochmical induction""; the eight subjects have three months to prepare for their first group meeting. The architect of this experiment, the eminent aphrodisiast and therorist Dr. Luther Stringfellow, exponent of the existenial-organic approach to, the socio-chemisty of the erotic, is strangely apsent.The eight subjects walk or run down endless corridors of the building as well as stroll through sunlit gardens, and interact with each other without speaking. They form attachments to their researchers, a telepathic dependencey which is also ""an extreme form of psychia addiction."" If they are removed from the object of their dependencey for too long, severe psychic disorinentation manifests itself.In the meeting room, a man undresses a woman and caresses an anatomical model while she sits blindfolded. Two other subjects regard Tarot cards and contemplate symbols. The narrator further speaks of a dominant telepathic personality that must learn to give way to the conglomerate that runs the project. Others may try to avoid telepathic contact by ""schizophrenetic partition""; conjuring up a false telepathic self that induces images of depravity and moral decay. The conglomerate is expected to displace the redundant nuclear family because of its adherence to principals of faith, love, and dependency.Over a slow-motion semi-orgy, the narrator admits that the subjects (strangers who have no telepathic flow) have denied their telepathic communication when EEG monitors proved a very strong connection. Also, two of the eight subjects have commited suicide and that Dr. Stringfellow's absence may be explained by psychic dependency being reciprocal between telepathists and non-paranormals. The final shot has the narrator stating that the data on the psychic interaction of the six remaining subjects has yet to be analized."

However, they agree not to test their friendship and just be friends with her. Soon, reality kicks in. Best friends Bert and Taylor, who are twenty-something American college students, are spending their summer driving around Italy and France in an older model Puegeot purchased in Italy, before heading back to the States in September for school. Taylor is the straight-laced, reliable one, who admits that he has problems expressing his feelings, especially to women, while Bert is the smooth talking player. They only have a general idea of where they will go and what they will do, but hoping that they can have some casual female companionship at their various stops. In Florence, they do one better when Taylor meets Marty, a ex-pat Brit living in Paris, he who believes she is a kindred spirit. As such, he suggests to Bert that they ask her along on the remainder of their trip, she to pay her fair share, and if things don't work out that they will part company with no hard feelings. Although both Taylor and Bert think she attractive, they also make a pact not to complicate the situation by getting into a romantic and/or sexual situation with her. Marty agrees with the plan. But as the three spend more and more time together before the summer ends, each will have to decide what their time together really means, and if the no sex pact is broken, what that will do to the situation in the present and to the ""best friend"" friendship between Bert and Taylor in the future.—Huggo It's the end of summer and two friends Taylor (Sam Waterston) and Bert (Robie Porter) decide to drive from Italy to France in an old car, a last hurrah before Taylor goes back home to study law. You find out during the course of film that Taylor comes from money, his father is a doctor. Bert trusts Taylor with managing the finances, because Bert doesn't have a lot of money, but Taylor is more than generous.The movie is paced deliberately with hints that youth is fleeting. The boys have a few clumsy attempts at being carefree and it's readily apparent that Bert is better at it that Taylor. Taylor is quiet and introspective and he is dependent on Bert to help bring him into social situations.One day by chance, Taylor is on his own when he meets Marty (Charlotte Rampling), a woman he later comes to learn is on her own, slumming it away from home in France because she didn't want to be anywhere near her mother and whatever number husband the mother is on. He likes her at once and he has the idea of inviting her along to journey with them back to France. They are to travel together but they are free to do whatever they want with two exceptions: each pays their own way and they are not to be intimate with each other. Taylor can't find it in himself to ask, so Bert does it and Marty accepts.During the course of the arrangement, even after a thinly veiled attempt to tell both of the men that she doesn't mind being with either or both of them, Bert finds a local girl and disappears for a while, leaving Marty and Taylor to their own devices. Marty tries to entice Taylor to sleep with her and even after a passionate embrace but in the end Taylor decides not to jeopardize the arrangement. He tells Marty indirectly that he's fallen for her, and he'll send her letter from the boat on the way home.After a drunken night out with Bert (who most likely suspects what has happened but doesn't say) Taylor changes a little. He tries to be more carefree, even talks of staying in France to go to school instead of going home. Bert has ended his fling and its back to the three of them traveling.The boys are due to leave within a week or so when the three of them are picnicking by the ocean. They witness a boat accident and a man is in obvious distress. Bert and Marty are passive about it, there's a boat in route and they believe the man will be fine. Taylor just can't stand watching this man struggle, so he jumps into the ocean and swims out to help. He doesn't make it to the man, as predicted a boat picks him up. As Taylor swims back, something happens (it's not abundantly clear to me if he has a cramp or is caught by the undertow) but he is shaken up by the experience.Bert and Marty want to go out that night but Taylor declines. Bert says he'll see Taylor later and departs. Taylor has a fitful night of sleep, the ocean haunting him.

I am Ben Thompson's close friend: Death - the physician who cures all pain. For the next five bloody days, I ride with my mortal messenger Ben Thompson collecting the debt all men must pay.""A Yaqui mounting a pinto horse with a few black patches, looks over the plane below him. And Death intones again: ""Yaqui chieftain Satago ('John ""Bud"" Cardos' (qv) in a dual role) slaughtered the white man's bride and woman, in the name of justice for his people. White man has killed his game, driven his pride from his hunting ground, and broken every treaty. Where Satago goes, I am, for he too, is my emissary, and Death is his way of life.""Ben comes across a couple who's riding on a single horse: Joe Lightfoot ('JOHN ""BUD"" CARDOS' (qv)) presents himself as Satago's half-brother, and his wife, Little Fawn ('MARIA POLO' (qv)), coveted by Satago.
He warns that Satago and his warriors now have guns, and are throwing all white men away from their territory.Ben visits Mary Johnson's burial - killed on their wedding night by Satago - and arrives just-in-time to save a former girlfriend, Nora ('VICKI VOLANTE' (qv)) who was hunting on the mountain range when she was attacked by a lone Yaqui ('AL ADAMSON' (qv)). Ben challenges the Indian to a knife fight. The paleface stabs the Indian, who falls off a cliff to his death.Nora reproaches Ben for not looking for her when he came back from the war, and tells him that she married Dave who's out in Tucson. Ben says he's married, and she tells him that his wife is dead, and she would have wanted him to live; ""Revenge is mine, said the Lord,"" Nora quotes from the Bible to Ben. Nora's husband, Dave Miller ('KENT OSBORNE' (qv)), is out at Tucson, and Ben has got a superficial wound, so they go together to her ranch.Next morning, Ben is standing guard on their front porch, when Nora serves him fresh coffee, just as Dave returns home. Ben informs him of the Apache renegades, named Yaqui. Dave knocks the coffee out of Ben's hand, says he has never had Indian trouble before, and orders Ben out. Ben leaves, warning Nora to go to town until the Indians calm down, but Dave does not listen to reason. Stubborn Dave left the house, but was still close enough to come back and defend it when Satago shows up, leading a number of warriors. They use flame arrows to set the house ablaze. Nora is a good shot, and kills a topless Yaqui point blank, but then another shoots an arrow through her back. Out of ammunition, Dave is impaled by Satago's spear. Satago takes Nora's scalp, and lifts it in the air, in triumph. Then he does the same with Dave's hair.Death tells that she has other earthly emissaries, such as gunrunners. Clay Bates ('JIM DAVIS' (qv)) and his slow thinking partner, Horace Wiggins ('RAY YOUNG' (qv)), are gunrunners to Satago's band. After receiving their latest shipment of guns for gold, a Yaqui with war paint on his face ('Tom Goldrup' (qv)) gives them two days to get out of the territory. Clay has to detail his meaning to Horace, that it means they'll wind up supper for ants if they don't live soon.Ben comes upon the wounded Joe Lightfoot, who was hunting for supper when he was jumped by two Yaquis. Ben yanks the arrow out of Joe's left shoulder, then patches him up after he's fainted. Once he's revived, they head to Joe's camp to rejoin Little Fawn.Meanwhile, Satago captures Little Fawn, lashes her hands and feet to stakes, admires her spread-eagled body, and leaves her for the ants and vultures. [scene cut from video prints] The vultures lead Clay and Horace to her. Clay rips her clothes off, and rapes her [scene cut from video prints], then shoots her dead before Horace can have his turn. ""It was the right thing to do,"" he explains to his sorrowful companion. Horace still wants something from Little Fawn, and takes her silver necklace, but when he shows it to Clay, he takes it from him, ""Let me see... I'll keep it as a little memento."" Ben and Joe arrive too late. Joe unties Little Fawn's body and carries it from the river side, to bury her.Satago attacks a covered wagon traveling West, the Driver tries to make a desperate run for escape on the poor trail, the wagon overturns and crashes. From the wreckage emerge the young Wagon Driver ('FRED MEYERS' (qv)) and the old wagon guard Rawhide ('Victor Adamson' (qv) aka Denver Dixon), a black clad preacher Boone Hawkins ('JOHN CARRADINE' (qv)), a redhead saloon keeper Kansas Kelly ('PAULA RAYMOND' (qv)) and her two working girls a brunette in a red dress, Althea Richards (TARA ASHTON aka 'DARLENE LUCHT' (qv)) and a blonde in black dress, Lavinia Wade ('JULIE EDWARDS' (qv), and a well dressed man who seems to be their boss, Jim Wade ('SCOTT BRADY' (qv)), The Indians depart after the men start shooting at them. Althea serves some water to the preacher - exchanging words with him about cleanliness of the soul, devil things, faith, and prayer - then to Rawhide, and lastly, to Jim. Lavinia does not like Althea getting so close to Jim. The Preacher has a good look at Kansas Kelly, when she lifts her skirt - either to look at the flask of whisky she has hidden under it, or her legs in lacy black stockings.Ben Thompson and Joe Lightfoot arrive, persecuted by the Yaquis. Jim fires, killing one, apparently scaring the others away. Jim recognizes Ben, but before they can talk, the Yaqui shoot the Driver in the back, killing him. [They also shoot Rawhide dead, in a scene cut from video prints.] Jim tells Ben that he is going to Tucson with one of the ladies, motioning to Lavinia, and asks Ben if he intends to make Joe a permanent partner. ""There's nothing permanent with me but Death,"" replies Ben.Lavinia uses the break from the Indians' attack to confronts her colleague. ""Fancy bloomer, I want to have a talk with you. [shove] Get your hands off my man!...""
""If not?...""
""Just be away from him, do you understand?"" [ripping off the red dress on the shoulder]
Lavinia and Althea fight, rolling on the dirt in their sleeveless, saloon-girls' dresses. Joe and the Preacher separate them quickly, while Jim and Ben look on, smiling. Althea gives Ben a good look back, as his eyes trade on her naked left shoulder, and then goes behind some boulders to change her ripped dress for a red shirt and denim trousers. The Preacher sneaks behind her, to see her nude - but Joe stops his moment of joy short.Ben talks with Kansas Kelly, whom he has known as saloon owner. Joe talks friendly with Althea, then shoves her aside... and shoots up an Indian who was about to attack them. The Indian makes a nasty fall to his death.During the night camp, Jim Wade slaps Lavinia repeatedly, but Kansas Kelly crashes a bottle on his head, knocking him out. Lavinia cries out in shock to the Madam, ""You better not have hurt him!"" Kansas Kelly retorts that the man is alright, because she has the practice of cracking men's skulls. Althea turns to Joe, ""That was awful!"" Joe smiles back, and says, ""Jim and Lavinia? they've been doing that for years. Most women like it."" Althea is speechless for a moment, then asks, ""Is a woman to be possessed like a horse?"" The question goes unanswered, and she prods him with other questions, about the other men who Joe knows, and about his marriage life...The five survivors proceed to walk to Tucson - the women riding Ben's and Joe's horses - when they meet with the gunrunners, Clay Bates and Boone Hawkins, and ask them permission to use one of their horses for they've got three women and only two horses. Boon tells Ben derisively, that he gives up his horse for ""no man or woman"". Horace, however, gladly gives up his horse for Althea...During another rest stop, Joe goes to the river with Althea, for her to help him clean his shoulder wound. The two talk a bit, with Althea showing an interest in the handsome half-breed, but he shows her his late wife's medallion and says that he is too much in grief to care for life again.Clay sneaks up on the Lavinia, bathing in her underclothes, nearby. He has got her lacy bra in his hand, so she shouts for him to let her clothes down. Her voice brings Jim running from where he was shaving. Clay tells the blonde that he wants her real bad, and shows her what he's got for her: Little Fawn's silver necklace and medallion. Jim Wade knocks him out with a few punches, then he harshly tells Lavinia to put some clothes on. She has time to beg his pardon, but she doesn't put her clothes on. A Yaqui shoots an arrow into her back. Jim blasts the offending Indian dead with a revolver shot, and carries the blonde's body out of the water. Ben and Joe come to the rescue after hearing the shot, and Joe sees Little Fawn's necklace fallen out of Clay's hand - but manages to keep silent about it.The preacher makes a short speech as they bury Lavinia. Later, when Ben is out scouting with Jim, Clay is drinking too much, and Althea tries to get information from Kansas Kelly about Ben. [Flashback scene cut from video prints: Ben Thompson goes to bed with topless saloon girl Val ('Jill Woelfel' (qv)), then feels guilty for the memory of his late wife.]Horace tries to slap Clay awake but fails; then he takes a liking to it, slapping him repeatedly until Althea cries, ""You're going to kill him!"" Joe intervenes and hits Horace with the butt of the carbine, wounding him.Yet, Horace rampages away, and takes a gun, and Althea as a hostage, menacing her with a knife and demanding Joe to drop his gun. He's about to shoot the half-breed when preacher Boone tells him that can't be allowed. Boone disregards Horace's menaces, and reads from the Bible, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave the world his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" [John, 3:16] With the last word, Boone blows the gunrunner a shot in the belly from the derringer he had concealed in his Bible. Horace falls face down, after calling for Clay. Boone tells Ben that indeed, he had not been a preacher all of his life.Clay was not expecting this, and rides off, with the vengeful Joe in pursuit. After a flying tackle from horseback, Joe knocks Clay out, and ropes him to stakes in the ground, just like he had left Little Fawn. Joe brandishes the necklace in his face, but his triumph is cut short by a Yaqui bullet in his gut. Before he dies, Joe stabs the bound Clay to death. Then, Satago orders his three remaining braves to shoot Joe point blank with arrows.Jim gives up waiting for Joe's return and orders his companions to walk away. Preacher Boone catches a Yaqui arrow intended for Kansas Kelly, who grabs the preacher's derringer and shoots his killer. Another Yaqui got close enough to stab Kelly in the back. Jim shoots this warrior down.Next is Jim Wade who is shot; he dies slowly, recalling his past dreams to Ben and Althea, and then says his last words between coughs, ""Hey, listen, if you're dumb enough to waste time burying me, I promise yeah, I'll come back and haunt you.""Ben and Althea have a moment of respite at the top of the mesa, overlooking the river below. Satago orders his two braves to attack them - one using a bow-and-arrow, the other a gun. The Yaqui who had been in the gold-for-guns trade grins, as he prepares to shoot his arrow at Ben, distracted with the cleaning of his revolver. Althea sees the Indian and tries to warn Ben, taking the arrow herself in the back, and dies in his arms. Ben reacts promptly, emptying his revolver on the attackers, hitting both, who fell off the cliff.At last, Ben and Satago come face to face. Satago buries his spear on the ground, dismounts, and advances towards Ben with his knife. Ben also takes a knife from his boot holster. They knife fight briefly, disarm each other with kicks and punches. Then they keep on fighting with naked hands, kicking and wrestling on the dirt, rolling down the cliff, and onto a stream.Death says, ""Here in this vast silent valley, it might well be the ending or the beginning of the world. These two men, each of whom is certain of the justice and honor for which he does battle, meet - in a final confrontation. One of them will come to me, the other will ride on, seeking me. For in violence between men and me, there can be but one victor. That... is Death!""Eventually, Ben manages to swim ashore, and Satago - too tired to do the same - is washed away down the river and a waterfall, drowning in the water. Ben buries his friends, and rides on, leaving four graves behind.Death's concluding statement: ""Ben Thompson certainly will ride. As he rides away from this bloody valley, his friends and his enemies have found their ultimate destiny, so I rightly decided, on my pale horse... for I am Death. I'm necessarily in existence, it's not necessary to invent me, for only I can cure the pain of the living, only I can show living things that dying is nothing more than ceasing to be afraid."""

Then a typical French middle-class family, the Passereau : husband, wife (Janine Berdin), two children, and the wife's father, all on their way to their holiday on the seaside.Charlie drives back to his garage to find a big black American car waiting for him and for petrol. Seated in the back, is a very elegant man, who calls himself Baron Cesar (Yves Montand). Actually he is a gangster, and, seated in the front, are his two henchmen, Max (Jacques Balutin) and Schwarz (Pierre Tornade). Charlie, like he had done before with the other cars, prevents the car from starting again and then tells Cesar that he only telephone available is at the castle. They all climb inside the small Citroen, Cesar carrying a black briefcase.It is dinner-time in the dining-room of the castle. Everyone is very elegantly dressed and Jeanne is playing the piano.Downstairs, Cesar walks in with his two henchmen, and climbs the main staircase to the first floor lobby, where he uses the telephone without bothering to ask permission to do it. He asks for a number in Torino, Italy, and is told by the operator he has to wait to be called back.The Marquise talks to him with Grande Dame manners, and tells him she is ready to call the police. Cesar answers back with charm and smooth talk. He walks into the dining-room, and when he sees a very attractive Diane in a splendid green dress, he starts dancing a beautiful waltz with her. Then everyone starts dancing. But they are interrupted by the telephone ringing.Cesar tells Louvanski, his accomplice waiting for him in Torino, about his car problem, but Louvanski answers that the plane is already on its way. Cesar tells him he will call him back the next day. He puts the telephone down and wishes good night to all the ladies, who can't take their eyes off him.In the Marquise's bedroom, the Marquise, Jeanne, Diane and Amélie are listening to the radio, which tells about a bank robbery in Macon. A hundred millions francs have been stolen (100 millions francs in 1967 would be 125 millions euros in 2014).They stop the radio and start talking about Cesar, whom they all fell in love with. To prevent Diane from having an affair with Cesar, the Marquise asks Amélie to go and have Charlie fix Cesar's car as soon as possible, so they can send this «devil» away.When Amélie tells Charlie about Cesar's car, he doesn't seem too pleased, because he knows it will take him all night to fix it. But when she tells him she will be waiting for him in his bed, he goes to work with a smile on his face.Meanwhile in the castle, Jean-Jacques is making Cookie wait at the locked door of his room, because he is taking care of his wig ! Cookie gets tired of asking him to open his door, and when, eventually, he opens it, she slams her door in his face. Jean-Jacques nervously snatches his wig away from his head and Cookie opens her door again !Early next morning, Charlie has just finished working on Cesar's car, but he is too tired to do anything with Amélie and he falls asleep. Amélie brings the car to Cesar, who pays his bill and drives away with his two henchmen. Jeanne, standing near the door of the castle, waves at Cesar, who looks at her with a pensive expression on his face.The car has just reached the village when they meet a police roadblock. They turn around, but they meet another roadblock a little further on the road. Cesar asked Schwarz to drive backward, while he gets out of the car and starts shooting at the policemen. The gearbox gets stuck in reverse, and the car, still driving backward, ends up in a big pond, where it disappears under water.The police has not seen the car diving into the pond, and they think it has escaped by another road. Cesar, who was hiding behind a wall, still carrying his precious briefcase, looks at the police going away, and starts walking across the fields.Meanwhile, in the castle, everyone is getting ready to go to the church Sunday service, except Monsieur Patin, who is a professional atheist, and Amélie, who has decided she doesn't believe in God anymore, and consequently watches the castle while her family is away.We see Charlie coming to the castle on his bicycle, and further away, across the fields, Cesar discreetly walking back to the castle. In her room, Amélie, with a pair of binoculars, is watching the Swedish tourists swimming naked and doesn't move when Charlie walks in her room and starts undressing her. But suddenly she sits up because she just saw Cesar coming back to the castle.She walks down in the hall of the castle, leaving Charlie in her room. Because she is hidden by a large pillar, Cesar doesn't see her when he walks into the hall, and asks for a number in Torino. As the telephone rings back, he notices Amélie and hides in a small room for privacy, but Amélie listens to his conversation with Louvanski, to whom he explains that he cannot leave the castle because of the police roadblocks. He asks Louvanski to come in the evening and land his plane on the wide meadow in front of the castle.As he walks out of the small room, he notices two gendarmes coming toward the castle. He hides again in the small room, leaving his briefcase on the counter. The gendarmes want to question Amélie about the bank robbery in Macon. Amélie discreetly peeks into Cesar's briefcase and sees the money.After the gendarmes' departure, Amélie asks Charlie to carry her on his bicycle to the church, leaving a perplexed Cesar in the castle.Inside the church, Amélie whispers what she has found about Cesar to her grandmother. The Marquise is first a bit shocked to know there is a gangster in her castle, then she decides to kill him and take the money back from him. She walks out of the church with Diane, Georges and Amélie, leaving Jeanne who plays the harmoniumBut, when they reach the castle, it is to find that the police is already there. A commissaire (Charles Mallet), who is a high-rank police officer, tells them that they are still looking for Cesar. The Marquise leaves the commissaire and goes in the park through the back door of the castle, but seeing nothing, comes back to the hall and tells the slightly surprised commissaire that she needs her binoculars to look at something cooking in the kitchen. With the binoculars, she sees Cesar coming back to the castle. She tells Diane to prevent Cesar from coming back and Georges to stay on the terrace and watch them with the binoculars.Then she comes back to the hall and the commissaire, who explains her that they have found the car with two dead bodies, but not Cesar.Meanwhile, Cesar is counting paces to make a perimeter for the landing of the plane, and keeps on walking toward the castle. Diane, lying in the grass, screams because «she's got an ant inside her dress» ! Cesar starts looking for the ant, fumbling inside Diane's dress.Meanwhile, the commissaire explains to the Marquise that they have found a receipt of the castle in the glove box of the drowned car, and then he asks why Amélie didn't say earlier to the gendarmes that Cesar had been staying in the castle. The Marquise quickly answers that her grand-daughter certainly fell in love with him. She slaps Amélie, who starts crying and tells her grandmother she doesn't know where Cesar is. The Marquise asks the commissaire to search the castle. The commissaire knows that Cesar is not in the castle anymore and he leaves the castle and the Marquise.As soon as the police is gone, the Marquise takes the binoculars to check on Diane who is flirting in the grass with Cesar. The Marquise rings the lunch bell, and Diane stands up and leave a disappointed Cesar.The Marquise goes to the greenhouse and pour a very powerful insecticide inside a sauce-boat. Coming out, she meets Cesar and Diane. She tells Cesar he could put his precious briefcase in the safe. She discreetly gives the sauce-boat to Georges and leads Cesar to a small room in the hall, where the safe is located. Cesar puts his briefcase in the safe, but keeps the key in his pocket.Coming out in the hall, Cesar smells food, and, lead by the Marquise, goes to the kitchen, where Georges is setting a lonely fish croquette on a tray. Cesar moves him away and starts setting the croquette. We then understand that Cesar in a very skilled chef. But when he puts the poisoned sauce on the croquette, the croquette explodes !A bit later, Georges is inside Amélie's bedroom, breaking the floor with a hammer and a chisel. Actually, Amélie's room is just above a small sitting-room, where the Marquise wants to organize a game of poker and sit Cesar just underneath a heavy chandelier. Georges is digging the floor to unhook the chandelier. He is also going to play some loud Wagner music, and when the Marquise will bang the ceiling with a broomstick, it will be the signal to unhook the chandelier.Charlie enters Amélie's room, but when he sees her father in the room, he goes down in the hall to meet Amélie.In the park, Monsieur Patin, Jean-Jacques et Mr Passereau are playing croquet. Cesar is talking to rapturous Cookie and Mrs Passereau, and telling them about the women he has known all over the world. Jeanne is also listening to him, but standing a little further away.Meanwhile, Diane is fixing two cups of coffee, one of them being poisoned. The Marquise calls Cesar and Jean-Jacques for a little game of poker. The two men sit down around the card table, but the Marquise moves them around, to be sure that Cesar is sitting right under the chandelier.The game starts, and, above them, Georges starts playing Wagner. Diane enters with the coffee. Cesar takes a cup (the non-poisoned one), drinks it and gives the other one to Jean-Jacques. Cesar wins the game, and mechanically takes the poisoned cup to drink it. But Diane screams and he puts the cup down. Diane says there is a rat in the room and Cesar stands up to look for the rat, but the Marquise forces him to sit down, and then climbs on a stepladder to bang the ceiling with her broom. But Cesar stands up again and starts looking around for the rat. He knocks on the floor to attract it. Georges thinks it is the Marquise's signal and unhook the chandelier, which falls on the card table, a few inches from Jean-Jacques, who drinks the poisoned coffee and immediately spits it out.Amélie and Charlie are flirting in the straw in a barn, when the Marquise barges in followed by Diane and Georges. She wants a saw, a ladder and a length of rope, for her new plan to kill Cesar.A bit later, in the forest around the castle, Diane, Amélie, Cesar and Jean-Jacques are playing tag. But Cesar, in his shirtsleeves, only plays this childish game to try to be alone with Diane. He eventually gets hold of Diane and kisses her, but she runs away, finds Amélie and tells her to get rid of Cesar. Amélie teases Cesar who follows her up a tree. But one of the branches of the tree had been partially sawed by Georges and Cesar falls in the river below. The flow of the river brings him under the wheel of a old watermill. We hear a loud snapping noise and the Marquise, Diane, Georges and Amélie think that Cesar is dead, and start crying.Actually, Cesar is not dead and further down on the river, he meets the Swedish tourists swimming naked in the river. He starts fooling around with them especially the girls !Meanwhile, in the castle, the Marquise wants to open the safe, but remembers that Cesar had taken the key. She tells Amélie to ask Charlie to bring the cars back and also some tools to open the safe.The guests are getting ready to leave the castle. Jean-Jacques meets Monsieur Patin, who tells him he had been in love for a long time with Jeanne. He was feeling ready to tell her about his love, but he thinks she is in love with someone else. Then all the guests say good-bye to the Marquise and leave the castle, except the Swedish tourists who are still swimming in the river.After the departure of the guests, the Marquise asks Charlie to open the safe. Charlie starts working, but warns the Marquise that it's not going to be an easy job.Meanwhile the Swedish tourists are coming back to the castle with Cesar. They climb into their car and drive away while Cesar walks into the castle to get his jacket and his hat.Meanwhile, Charlie is still trying unsuccessfully to open the safe. The Marquise thinks it would be better to try to open the back of the safe rather than the front. They all go in the next room, and close the door behind them. The Marquise shows Charlie exactly where he should start breaking to wall to reach the back of the safe.Meanwhile, Cesar, coming from the hall, walks into the safe room, opens the safe and takes his briefcase. He doesn't see Jeanne hidden in the hall and watching him.Meanwhile, Charlie succeeds in breaking the wall down, only to find the safe wide open and the briefcase gone.The night has come, and Cesar walks out of the castle, carrying a few camper gas lamps, which he starts setting around to make a runway for the plane. Jeanne follows him without being noticed by him, and she moves the lamps to different locations. When the plane tries to land on the meadow, it actually lands in the lake where it disappears underwater !Jeanne goes back in the music room of the castle, and starts playing the piano, when Cesar walks into the room.Meanwhile a very angry Marquise wants to sell the castle and buy a bistro. She wants to tell Jeanne about it. But, when she peeks inside the music room, she almost faints when she sees the supposedly dead Cesar talking with Jeanne.Inside the room, Cesar is telling Jeanne about himself, the real himself, that he is a gangster who hasn't done half of the things he pretends he has done. Jeanne answers that she doesn't care about who he really is, because he is the only man she has ever loved.The Marquise enters the music room with a big smile on her face and doesn't seem surprised to find Jeanne in Cesar's arms. She takes the briefcase and Cesar lets her do it.Three months later, the castle has become the four-star «Hotel du Grand Siècle». And Cesar is the well-known chef of the place, working in a very modern kitchen with a large team of cooks. The dining-room is full of very elegant guests, served by waiters with frock-coats.In the music room, Jeanne is playing the piano, while the Marquise, Diane and Amélie are doing nothing but listen to her, and wait for Cesar to do everything for them."

In the hope she'll learn herself what consequences the difference between boys and girls has, he tries to get her a boyfriend.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> Paul, called ""Männchen "" (little man), lives with his daughter, ""Herzblatt"" (Honeybun), whom he has raised alone after the death of his wife. He raised Herzblatt according to the instructions of a book by Dr. Seebauer, M.D. Following Seebauer, he taught Herzblatt not to be ashamed of her body. The nakedness of a human is normal Herzblatt has learned at a early age. This led to a fixation on her father, who is her father, mother, friend and playmate at the same time. Even now that Herzblatt is well into puberty, she still bathes with her father, both of whom enjoy soap-bubble battles, and she lives unabashedly naked in the apartment and on the roof terrace because she is unaware of her effect on men. Paul seeks advice from Dr. Seebauer to teach her about sex and its effects. He suggests searching for Herzblatt to find a young man who should direct her attention from Paul to a young man whom Paul is to find.
Paul turns to contractor Max, who has had to suffer indirectly from Herzblatt's charm; his construction site is located opposite Herzblatt's roof terrace. The workers, in turn, regularly fall off the scaffolding when they want to see the naked Herzblatt sun bathing. Max's three sons: Olaf, Otto and Oskar are respectively the sporty, alternative or well-bred son. All three are gradually introduced to Herzblatt and she eventually rejects all three of them.

Her ideal is taken from a scene that Ernest Hemingway describes in ""For whom the bell tolls:"" a couple rest and embrace by the side of a creek and ""the earth quakes."" The reported ""earthquake"" in the book Herzblatt takes as the ideal of real love, yet she feels no such quake with any of Max's sons.Herzblatt is increasingly annoyed because everyone talks only about sex. The education ministry issues a sex education book to be used in school for education. The teachers, however, balk at the book's presentation. When the student newspaper staff decide to print their own comments and demands (a location to practice the sex education) Herzblatt instead wants to write about Hemingway and romantic aspects found in his novels. She is ejected from the staff. She suspects, however, that she is slowly growing up. Meanwhile on the way to school, she repeatedly meets a similarly aged boy on a bridge who distributes fliers. He eventually puts a sheet in her hand, on which he has written ""I love you."" Herzblatt reacts uncertainly to this and soon asks Paul how he knew he was in love with her mother. Paul first spins a comical story, but then admits that it was the simple words ""I love you"" which he told her. Herzblatt immediately rushes to the flyer distributor and shows him in rejoinder his note with the words ""I love you."" Together they drive into the country, lie down together in a meadow and share a kiss. At that moment a nearby excavating dynamite blast takes place, causing the earth to quake just at the right time.

One Million AC/DC,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064763/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of sex-crazed cave people are being harassed by a Tyrannosaurus Rex. While they try to figure out a way to deal with this threat, they have sex and eat a lot. This is one of those movies that has cavemen living in the same era as dinosaurs -- scientifically inaccurate, but it makes for a fun movie. Showing that people were no different back then than they are today, the cavemen and cave-women have sex (lots of it), and sometimes jealous men will fight over a woman. Since this movie was written by Ed Wood, even the animals get into the sex swing-of-things: a Tyrannosaurus Rex (which is very obviously a puppet) pulls the top off a cave-woman, and a gorilla pursues women for mating purposes. Because it is a caveman movie (and cavemen didn't talk much), there isn't any snappy Ed Wood dialogue, and that is sorely missed by his fans; however the title of the movie is a great Ed Wood pun.—Vodka Gimlet, Jr."

Recently paroled convicts Herbie Haseler and Marty Miller are broke and go to New York to get funding for a planned heist from crime boss Nick Marco. Nick is tired of these two idiots who bungled their last caper and Nick is reluctant to finance Herbie and Marty again. Besides, the duo still owes ten thousand dollars compounded over the 5 years at 100% to Nick for bankrolling the armored car heist that went wrong, sending Herbie and Marty to prison. However, Herbie has been in charge of the prison library and has studied a lot. He convinces Nick to finance one more caper, this time in England, where many rich lords live in opulent mansions. These English mansions house many treasures, including fine art, priceless paintings, antiquities and more. Although skeptical, New York mob boss Nick Marco reluctantly agrees to send Herbie and Marty to England to add some rare paintings to his collection. Nick also gets in touch with his mob contacts in the UK to assist Herbie and Marty. The contact is Frank Finley, the London mob boss who owns most of the London casinos. The target is the large English countryside estate of elderly Lady Sophie Fitzmore who lives with her loyal nephew Freddie Fritzmore.

In discovering they owe several hundred thousand dollars to the syndicate led by Nick Marco for their last bungled robbery, the one that sent them to prison this latest time, they are able to convince Nick to go in with them as providing the necessary expenses for that heist in return for a percentage of the take: to rob one of the stately English country manors of its largely unprotected riches. The one Herbie believes is the best choice is Greyfriar's Manor owned by Lord Freddie Fitzmore, and in taking only the most portable of the items would net them at least $5 million. In scoping out the manor, Herbie and Marty befriend Freddie and his eccentric grandmother, Lady Sophie Fitzmore, in addition to a few more exotic creatures in the form of a lion and tigers. They are also able to wend their way into a position to make the job easier than they anticipated.

Life Love Death,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065179/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"""Life, Love, Death"" was made before the abolition of capital punishment in France. Its central message is the inhumanity of the guillotine. The film, which is shot somewhat in a cinema verite style, divides roughly into three acts. In Act One, there is a series of murders of prostitutes in Paris. An obviously deeply disturbed man is hiring these prostitutes and then strangling them. Suspicion falls on François (Amidou), a married man with a child. The police put him under surveillance. (Viewers will recognize the inspector in charge of the team as Marcel Bozzuffi, who would play Popeye Doyle's nemesis in The French Connection a couple of years later.) Ironically, François is experiencing spiritual healing and renewal through the power of love---not with his wife, of course, this being a French film, but through an affair with a beautiful young woman he has met (not a prostitute). But just as this is happening and François seems to have lost the need to commit violent crimes, he is arrested. Act Two is the arraignment, trial and exposition of François's life and history. His recent transformation, of course, makes no impression on the court, and he is sentenced to death by guillotine. Act Three is a documentary-style record of François's last days in prison and his execution. The last scene in the film is an image of the guillotine's blade beginning its descent; it slows and freezes and there is a fade to black, as a voiceover issues a passionate plea for abolition of the guillotine.—mfisher452"

The Vixens,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248603/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In this modern sexual morality thriller, a pair of modern country couples lounge around, eyeing each other with heavy-lidded salaciousness, then pairing off illicitly, while one of the wives recounts to a detective how she accidentally toppled her husband over the rim of Croton Reservoir upstate New York. Or was it an accident? A man and a woman run onto a high bridge that spans a dam. On a bet the man begins to walk on the edge of the narrow wall. He slips--or is pushed--and plunges to his death. In a police station later, Betty, the man's wife, reconstructs the events of the few weeks before the tragedy: Her childless marriage to Bob, held together paradoxically by infidelities, is further aggravated when an equally disillusioned couple, Ann and Alan, move into their suburban neighborhood. The quartet enter into a series of mate-swapping episodes and the arrangement holds their respective marriages together. Soon a third couple, Judy and Harold, who had a similar arrangement with Bob and Betty some years earlier, arrive on the scene. In a drinking spree one afternoon, Harold dares Bob to walk the wall of the bridge over the dam. Bob accepts the bet, wagering Betty against Harold's $50. Though Harold wins, he faints before collecting his prize. Bob, taunted by Betty for losing his courage, persuades Alan to join him and Judy for a garden party. As intended by Bob, Ann and Betty stumble upon the threesome's lovemaking and their revulsion awakens in them a closeness that they have never experienced with any man. After listening to Betty's story, the inspector tells her what he believes happened: She and Bob have a drunken quarrel in their car over her emasculating behavior and her feelings for Ann. Already resentful of Betty's repeated references to his lack of manhood, Bob tries to walk across the dam but in the process falls to his death. The inspector points out to Betty that, since there is no mud on her shoes, she obviously never left the car; her guilt, if there is any, is moral, not legal. Leaving the police station, Betty is met by Ann. Upon noticing there is mud on Ann's shoes, Betty suddenly realizes what actually happened on the bridge. Ann suggests she will keep the shoes, and Betty realizes that her tie to Ann is the knowledge of their mutual implication in Bob's death."

Red Lion,1969,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063995/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Impersonating an Imperial Army officer by wearing a ""red lion's mane"", a poor servant returns to his village after 10 years of absence to end the village's suffering caused by corrupt officials and businessmen. The year is 1868. The Tokugawa shogunate has been overthrown, and the Empire restored. The White-hair officers and the Red Vanguard meet on a rainy day. The leader of the White-hair officers tells Sagara Sozo, the leader of the Red Vanguard, to announce that there will be taxes cut by half in all towns. One foot-soldier, Gonzo, is so excited by this prospect that he decides to ride home wearing Sagara's red shaguma. As soon as he rides into the middle of the street, the clumsy Gonzo falls off his horse and is almost trampled by villagers being oppressed by enforcers. Mistaking him for a captain, a kindly young woman takes Gonzo in and fills him in on what has been going on in the past ten years, while he was absent: the town has been swindled from years by a corrupt magistrate, KomaTora who pays the love of Gonzo's life, a prostitute named Tomi, for sex. Outraged, Gonzo goes limping down the street to announce the Imperial Restoration and take down KomaTora. On the way, he sees an old man named Gohei, who is trying to hang himself. Gonzo cuts the rope and talks Gohei out of suicide. KomaTora is about to punish hotheaded rebel leader Sanji by making him cut off his own fingers when Gonzo charges in and cuts the chopping block in half. A stunned KomaTora remembers how he had Gonzo whipped, tied up, and thrown into the river after taking Tomi from him, and is amazed that Gonzo is still alive. Gonzo announces that he is a member of the Red Vanguard, the Tokugawa Shogunate is ""kaput"", and the Empire has been restored. He demands to know where Tomi is, and goes to look for her. On his way to the brothel, Gonzo meets Sanji, who admits that he's an ""Edo guy"". He doesn't like the Empire, so having an Imperial soldier saving him puts him in an awkward position. At the brothel, Gonzo announces to the prostitutes that he stole their contracts from KomaTora. They're skeptical and laugh at him, but he has Sanji read out the documents. Convinced, the prostitutes all come running out. Gonzo sees that Tomi is not among them. Running inside, he finds her in her room. She's shocked to see him alive. Years ago, after KomaTora tried to kill Gonzo, he told Tomi that Gonzo was dead and raped her. Gonzo tells Tomi that he has her contract and, taking off the red wig, joyfully embraces her.
The Tokugawa sympathizers visit a mercenary named Hanzo, whom they hire to get rid of Gonzo. Hanzo agrees, but demands money.
Meanwhile, Tomi gives Gonzo boiled zenmai to eat. Gonzo remarks that it's just like the zenmai his mother made, and finds to his surprise that his mother, Ume, is living in the brothel. Ume fills Gonzo in on what has been happening since his absence: his father died, they couldn't pay the taxes and their family farm got taken away. Tomi's father killed himself in that time as well. Gonzo is hit hard by the news. Sanji comes to visit and tells Gonzo that he learned English from old Dr. Gensai, who was the one who started the rebellion against KomaTora. Gonzo visits the youth army, gains their trust and decides to lead an attack on Deputy Kintayu. On the way there, he meets Hanzo, who cuts off part of his wig, declaring that Red Lions piss him off. Gonzo rebuts that the world is changing, but Hanzo shoots this down, claiming that the only thing that will change is the flower on the Imperial crest. He decides not to fight Gonzo now, dismissing him as a ""kids' coach"", and Gonzo continues on his way. Before he arrives at the Deputy's house, Gonzo decides that most of the youths, one of them the son of a lumberjack, should stay behind and keep a lookout while he and several of the others, including Sanji, go in the front and demand to see the Deputy. While the Deputy hides in a latrine, a Tokugawa loyalist tries to bribe Gonzo with money. Gonzo angrily turns down the offer. At that moment, a young man throws shrine paper down from a tree. Gonzo proclaims it a miracle and rejoices along with the rest of the villagers. He gives away the land tax rice to the villagers and declares it to be a world where farmers will prevail. Gonzo forgets about the boys he left behind and they're caught by a Shogunate sympathizer.
That night, the villagers celebrate, dancing and chanting, ""Eijanaika, eijanaika, eijanaika!"", meaning ""Whatever, whatever, whatever!"" Gonzo and Tomi happily watch the party, and are brought a huge hamper especially for them.
One man, Kisoya, contributes money to the Imperial force- five hundred ryo. As Gonzo tries to remember where exactly this contribution is going to go, he describes all of the Imperial officers he remembers. Kintayu and KomaTora are brought before Gonzo and he jokingly decides how to punish them. Kintayu receives a scolding message from a mysterious Shogunate sympathizer force known as ""Mobile Unit One"". Sanji steals the letter and shows it to Gonzo. Just then, Gonzo gets news that Hanzo wants to duel with him outside the tavern. Despite protests from his friends, Gonzo agrees to the duel. As he goes out into the street, one of the youths who had escaped from capture, Kesaji, goes to tell Gonzo that the rest had been beaten and ordered to cut down trees on Mount Kenashi. Gonzo agrees to rescue Kesaji's friends once he's finished with the duel.
A shot rings out and Kesaji falls down dead in the street. Gonzo curses and urges everyone to get back. Gonzo confronts Hanzo, who proves to Gonzo that he didn't shoot the youth, but whoever did is a coward. He bids a bemused Gonzo farewell.
Gonzo and Tomi spend the night together. Tomi has a nightmare and screams in her sleep, inadvertently waking Gonzo. He wakes Tomi and asks what's wrong. She tearfully confesses that she had a dream that she was being beaten, whipped and forced to stand naked in snow, which is what they used to do to her a long time ago, as punishment for not earning enough. Gonzo consoles her for a while, before realizing that he has to rescue the captured lumberjacks."

The woman in a red bikini is not seen again - either an Intelligence Agent or yet a double agent, possibly killed by Jack in a scene cut from both the Spanish and Italian language versions.]Solva is at the casino, wearing a red evening dress, sitting at a cards' table opposite a brunette Woman in a Yellow Dress. Solva stands, and leaves for the show room.Alex and Maura are at the roulette table, when a buxom Woman in Decoletee Dress approaches Alex, and plays - without sitting - 100 dollars at the 00. She loses, and leaves, telling him that there is a good singer at the show room. Alex leaves after her, but Maura - who was starting to win - follows him reluctantly.The Woman in Decoletee Dress goes to her white convertible car parked in front of the hotel, and is about to start the car when she is killed by a single chop of Jack's steel hand, who'd been hiding in the back seat.Jack cleans the blood off the golden hand before donning a large glove over it, and joining Solva at the show room - at a table some distance from Alex's. Solva is wearing a sleeveless red evening dress, and had been at the casino watching Alex.They're listening to the Singer - alias, S.O.S. Agent 380 - in a silver mini-dress, knee boots and... hat with ear flaps. A beautiful waitress calls Alex to the telephone, and he replies, «Thanks, beautiful!» But when he goes to the bar counter, it was only a way for the Singer to pass by him, already attired in a street suit, leaving him a message rolled in the cigarette butt she smashes on the ashtray in front of him.Alex was wise to the Singer's maneuver, and unrolls the message: «Blue car at three». Solva hails a Rochdale taxi cab, and follows Cristal.
Alex tries to discover who is the person following him, and goes outside, then he prepares a mini voice recorder with his own voice saying, «Stop! Don't move!». After a running chase down the rock bordering the beach, Alex reaches back to the machine rooms in the hotel's basement - which door was open ajar - followed by Jack. Placing the mini voice recorder away from him, and starting it by remote control, he disturbs Jack enough to knock him by surprise. Even so, Jack and Alex fight hand to hand - with Jack's steel hand breaking a water steam pipe. After knocking down Jack with an uppercut to the chin, Alex choses to leave him and recuperate his little voice recorder.(1:05:40) Solva's chase in the taxi ends not at a dead end, but at a straight alley when another car comes between the taxi and the fugitive.Meanwhile, Maura in a light yellow dress, red scarf around the bosom and triple pearl necklace, pays the bill and leaves the table, going to the ladies' room downstairs. She is followed by a female S.O.S. Agent 64 in a yellow mini dress and a double pearl necklace. She ambushes the attacker in the corridor, delivers a couple of karate chops dizzying her, but the girl kicks her away. Maura falls a couple of feet down the corridor, and the girl pulls a small pistol on Maura, who draws fast an evil smaller pistol disguised in her big hairdo. Maura shoots first, and the Agent 64 falls on her back, dying with a muffled scream, the hiked dress exposing her legs. Maura hurries up the stairs, and leaves, but misses Alex for a second.Alex boarded the blue car at 3 a.m. sharp outside the hotel main entrance. Maura calls a taxi to follow him, and another chase is on.The blue car driver is an Intelligence Agent, who takes Alex to the Singer, an undercover agent, and she tells him what she knows about the chemical attack in preparation, and the location of the laboratory. She says goodbye to him with a passionate kiss, and he leaves her at the airport. Maura pays the taxi, and goes immediately after Alex.Appearing from nowhere, Jack shoots the Driver and the Singer with shots to the head, killing both inside the blue car, as they were still parked to watch the departure of Alex's flight. Maura loses Alex again, and is told by an airport worker that it was «the flight 421 to Miami».MIAMI(1:10:50) At S.O.S. headquarters, Solva tells her three senior female agents - how the virus production is progressing. Natasha, Ingrid and Monique had been present at the airport wearing black, and are now in a variety of evening gowns, like Solva is. They question the leader about details of the operation.Aerial view of Miami, and close-up on Hotel Fontainebleau, and its swimming pool by the ocean. Solva meets again with her three of her agents, at one of the hotel rooms. From the balcony, they detect the presence of Alex Dinamo. While fondling her white poodle, she asks Monique «to take care of him». «It will be my pleasure,» the girl answers.The svelte brunette dons a white swimming cap over her shoulder length hair, to match her white bikini, and proceeds to attract Alex's attentions. She swims across pool towards him - with close-ups of underwater photography and subjective camera from Jack's point of view, in a glass window allowing for that sort of show for customers in a basement bar. Monique feigns a French accent, asks for a hand to hoist herself from the swimming pool, throws water upon his sports suit, feigns a torn ankle. Alex starts massaging the girl's alleged sprained ankle by the swimming pool.Maura tells him she didn't like being left alone at Puerto Rico, and the ""French"" Monique frees her hair to better entice the man. Maura turns her back and leaves in a rage. Monique finally asks Alex to help her walk to her hotel roomMeanwhile, Jack tells Solva that he is now going after Alex, but she changes her orders, and tells him «to take care of the girl», meaning Maura.After going up to her room, Maura stripped down to a bikini to pick a pair of binoculars and goes to the balcony window over the pool. Jack opens the door with a master-key, but only after turning the knob - enough to call Maura's attention. She waits behind the door, and attacks him with four karate chops to the neck that floor him, but he kicks her, then he knocks her out, and takes off the glove, to use the blunt side of his steel hand to deliver a fatal blow to her head. Through the door that he had left open ajar - a blonde in a black baby-doll - S.O.S. Agent 77 - shoots him in the back, dead. Maura wakes up - fresh - and meets the blonde, who leaves, saying just that she has information for Alex Dinamo.Meanwhile, Monique confesses the truth to Alex: she is not in pain, she just wanted his company. Before making love she wants to brush her hair, and from her hair comb she extracts a dagger with which to stab the agent in the neck. He was expecting an attack, dominates her, kisses her, and leaves her tied up and gagged in the bathroom.On an airport tarmac, Solva and a handful of agents, including armed commandos, watch as two light airplanes leave.Alex and S.O.S. Agent 77 are preparing to leave the hotel. Just in case, from his suitcase of equipment, he hands her a couple of smoke bombs.
They almost cross Solva her senior female agents - now attired in travelling clothes - at the hotel lobby. Just then, Solva inquires about Monique.
Natasha gets suspicious and follows the younger Blonde Agent... just in time to see her join Alex and S.O.S. Agent 77 leaving the hotel together in a blue Mercedes. She warns Solva via a radio hidden in their glasses: «77 has betrayed us.»Solva takes the call at Monique's room, just as another female agent is untying her. Solva immediately understands that Agent 77 is going to lead Alex to Yuma's laboratory. She puts her commandos in alert mode, and back-slaps Monique for her failure.Night has fallen. During the journey to the lab, Agent 77 tells Alex and Maura that she and her sister Barbara had infiltrated the S.O.S. under orders of the Intelligence Service.The two girls jump out of the car, armed with submachine guns, and Alex drives the car into the lab compound, attracting heavy submachine gun fire from the S.O.S. commandos. With their attention concentrated on him, and on blowing up the Mercedes, the two girls shoot down a number of guards from the darkness of the wood.Alex opens a door with a grenade, and he enters the lab, while the girls guard the door. Alex knocks out the scientist with the cross of the submachine gun, and prepares an injection of the virus that he injects on the man's neck. Without asking, Yuma opens the sealed room where the anti-virus is kept with the documents locating the contaminated waters. Alex knocks him out again, and leaves.The last guard was hidden, and fires at him; Alex kills the guard, but is wounded in the right thigh. He passes them to the girls, then blows up the lab - with Professor Yura inside.Solva sends a plane to pursue the three Intelligence agents across the Everglades, while Natasha and Ingrid go by jeep to the south sector, and Monique and her in two other jeeps to the north sector to cut out all escape routes. The speed run in the marshes using an air-boat ends quickly, because it had not much gasoline.From the air, S.O.S. Pilot locates the three fugitives. Agent 77 confirms that the documents are the real thing, but Alex is not able to call Intelligence headquarters via the radio in his wristwatch. The S.O.S. Pilot throws some grenades at the fugitives who run - Alex limping - away, with returning submachine gun fire.Solva and Monique's team happen to be in the fugitives way through the woods. Monique wounds Maura - who's wearing a black sweater and boots and a white skirt. The S.O.S. helicopter brings in a flame-thrower to burn the fugitives alive.(1:44:35) Alex ambushes and shoots Monique, while she was hiding between two trees and brushes, and then sends a grenade to finish her. Monique dies wearing a red sweater and a white skirt. Alex uses smoke grenades to create a diversion, and approach the helicopter, as Maura and Agent 77 keep holding their weapons and the box with the anti virus and the documents.(1:46:55) In a submachine gun duel at a short distance, Solva - wearing a white dress of military cut and a green sash hold by epaulets, and black boots - wounds the blonde Agent 77 - who's wearing the full black, figure hugging outfit of the male commandos. Alex shoots her immediately after, and Solva slumps back dead, he skirt exposing a bit of her legs.On board of the helicopter, Alex has some trouble to start the engine, but manages to do so before the surviving commandos stop him.
The International Service at last manages to contact Alex, who requires an ambulance at the airport, and complains about the shitty communication device he had been provided with. Then, he drops the wrist watch into the ocean.The antidote and the location map are handed over to the Intelligence Agent in Miami, and S.O.S. has lost again.Maura and former Agent 77 are recovering in hospital, while Alex is fighting against an old matron nurse who's imposing the non smoking law on him."
