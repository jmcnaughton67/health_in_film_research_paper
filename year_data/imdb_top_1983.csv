Luke Skywalker rescues his friends, but he will not be a true Jedi Knight until he confronts Darth Vader again, who has sworn to win him over to the Dark Side of the Force. With old favorites like Chewbacca, Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Lando Calrissian, plus the small, but stalwart Ewoks.—Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> The opening crawl reveals that Han Solo's friends are engaged in a mission to rescue the smuggler from Jabba the Hutt and that the Galactic Empire is building a new armored space station which is even larger and more powerful than the first Death Star.Near the forest moon of Endor the new Death Star is being constructed in orbit, and a command star destroyer arrives and launches a shuttle with a fighter escort -- a shuttle bearing the Dark Lord of the Sith. Fearing his arrival, the commander of the new Death Star informs Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice:James Earl Jones) that the station will be operational on schedule, but when Vader challenges this ""optimistic"" appraisal of the situation, the commander admits that he needs more men to accelerate construction. Darth Vader, however, informs the commander that the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) will be arriving soon, and that he is most displeased with the commander's progress. Shaken, the commander commits to redoubling construction efforts. Vader, pleased, remarks, ""the Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.""Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end ofStar Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice:Larry Ward). Luke sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to Jabba's desert palace to deliver a message: In a hologram projected by R2, Luke offers to bargain with Jabba for Solo himself -- if Jabba does not, he will be destroyed. Jabba laughs at the message and refuses to give up his ""favorite decoration:"" Han, frozen in carbonite, hangs on a wall in Jabba's court. The two droids are sent to EV-9D9's workshop where C-3P0 is given the job of Jabba's translator and R2 will be a drink-server on Jabba's sail barge.Disguised as a bounty hunter named Boushh, Leia arrives in Jabba's court with Chewbacca in cuffs. She offers him to Jabba for a sizable bounty. After Leia dickers with Jabba over the amount and threatens him with a small thermal detonator, Jabba happily agrees to pay, impressed with the bounty hunter's nerve, and Chewbacca is imprisoned.That night, Leia sneaks into Jabba's court and frees Han from the carbonite. However, she and Solo are both captured by Jabba. Solo is imprisoned with Chewbacca and Jabba keeps Leia on display in a metal bikini and chains. Luke arrives with a final ultimatum to release Solo. Jabba again refuses and drops Luke through a trap door into a pit below his throne that houses the rancor, a fearsome beast that Jabba keeps for executions. As Leia watches in horror, she sees Lando Calrissian disguised as a palace guard. After a brief battle, Luke defeats the rancor, enraging Jabba, who declares that Luke, Solo and Chewbacca will be slowly consumed by the sarlacc -- a huge, shark-toothed, tentacled maw at the bottom of the Great Pit of Carkoon.The group is taken to the pit on Jabba's sail barge fleet, and Jabba sadistically attempts to draw out the spectacle by inviting them to grovel for their lives. Han and Chewbacca refuse, but Luke calmly notes to the gangster that he is about to pay dearly for his arrogance to Jabba's scoffing amusement. The group is prepared for execution: Luke is the first, pushed out onto a thin plank over the pit. Luke gives R2 a short salute and drops off the plank, only to spin and grab the plank to launch himself back on board. At that moment, R2 catapults a small object, Luke's new lightsaber, to the Jedi's hand. A battle erupts, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. Solo accidentally knocks Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) into the sarlacc pit. Lando is also thrown off one of the skiffs, hanging by a few cables until he's rescued from the sarlacc itself by Han and Chewbacca. Luke, having fought his way onto Jabba's sail barge, has the escaping Leia aim the deck cannon at the vehicle and sets it on automatic fire; the sail barge soon blows apart. Our heroes manage to escape before it explodes, retrieve R2 and C-3PO and zip off into the desert. Luke flies off Tatooine in his X-Wing fighter and the rest of the band fly away in the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near Sullust.A massive fleet of fighters completely surrounds the boarding bays of the Death Star at the arrival of the Emperor. As Red Guards slowly descend from the Imperial shuttle and flank its ramp, Vader and the Death Star commander kneel to their master, the last to enter the hangar. He insists that Lord Vader will soon capture Luke Skywalker, and Luke will learn of the dark side of the Force when brought before Palpatine himself.Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, but he finds Yoda (voice:Frank Oz) is ill. He tells Luke that no further training is required and all that remains to be done is to confront Darth Vader. Luke attempts to get independent confirmation of Darth Vader's claim to be Luke's father, but Yoda is evasive. Finally, Luke begs Yoda to tell him the truth, and Yoda, emotional torture clearly evident on his normally serene features, confirms Luke's darkest fears. He correctly infers that Vader has used this information as an emotional weapon against Luke, and criticizes Luke for having faced Vader prematurely, with nearly disastrous consequences. He reminds Luke of the true nature of the Force, and of the soul-corrupting nature of the dark side. Yoda then issues a dark warning, telling Luke how his father fell to the shadow: he was corrupted by the powers and influence of the Emperor. If Luke allows himself to be manipulated by this dark mind, then he too shall become what he most fears.Finally, Yoda charges Luke with keeping alive the teachings and knowledge of the Jedi and the Force, urging him to start with his own family, with whom the Force is unusually strong. With his final breath, Yoda tells Luke that there is ""another Skywalker."" Yoda dies at peace, and before Luke's astonished eyes, his body vanishes, passing with his spirit into the Force. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) confronts a distraught Luke, confirming that Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who was turned to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan confesses to Luke that he made mistakes in Anakin's training, especially by not deferring to Yoda, and takes responsibility for indirectly creating the evil Darth Vader. Luke counters that even now, all is not lost, that some part of Anakin remains, if only someone can reach it. When Luke asks about the other Skywalker, Obi-Wan tells him that Luke has a twin sister, hidden from Anakin and separated from Luke at birth to protect them both from the Emperor. Luke intuits that his sister is Princess Leia. Obi-Wan confirms it, but warns Luke that in the eyes of the Empire, all bonds of love and caring are potential weaknesses to be exploited.Meanwhile, the entire Rebel Alliance fleet is massing their near Sullust, meeting to devise an attack strategy on the uncompleted Death Star. As part of the attack, Han and his companions must land on the forest moon of Endor and deactivate the generator that projects a protective shield up to the orbiting Death Star. The team, led by Han, will use a stolen Imperial shuttle and confirmation code to infiltrate the heavy security measures protecting the construction site before the rest of the Rebel fleet arrives. Luke arrives at the meeting and tells Han and Leia that he'll join them on the dangerous commando mission. The fleet's assault on the Death Star will be lead by Lando Calrissian, piloting the Millennium Falcon, which will fly into the core of the space station and destroy the main power generator.The team arrives at Endor in the stolen shuttle and uses the confirmation code to sneak past the Imperial fleet. Luke senses that Vader is aboard the Imperial fleet's largest ship, the super-star destroyer Executor, and believes he's endangering the mission. Han tells him not to worry.When they arrive on the moon, the team happens across a small unit of Imperial biker scouts. Han tries to sneak up on the scouts to disarm them but draws their attention when he steps on a branch. Leia and Luke jump on speeder bikes and pursue two more scouts through the forest at high speed. They overtake them both but are separated; Leia's bike crashes into a tree after she jumps off and she falls unconscious. Luke jumps off his own bike and battles with the the scout he'd been pursuing, forcing him to crash using his lightsaber. When Luke rejoins the team, he finds that Leia hasn't returned. The team looks for her but is captured by indigenous creatures called Ewoks -- short, furry, intelligent forest dwellers. An Ewok called Wicket (Warwick Davis) befriends Leia, but the other Ewoks who captured the rest of the Rebel party decide to sacrifice them to C-3P0, who they believe is a god. Luke, having mastered the Force, levitates C-3P0 to impress the Ewoks with the droid's power and scare them into giving up the sacrifice. With the help of C-3PO, Luke and his party form an alliance with the Ewoks, whose stone-age technology has unexpectedly effective military applications.Later, Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vader. He confesses to Leia that he is her brother, and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. She tells him to ignore his feelings and leave but Luke tells her that he must face his destiny and if necessary in the event that he falls, she must learn the ways of the Jedi to help oppose the Emperor. Luke surrenders peacefully to Vader but fails to convince his father to abandon the dark side even though Vader is left subtly shaken by his matured son's own mind games.They go to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, who reveals that the Rebel Alliance is walking into a trap. On the forest moon, the Rebels led by Solo and Leia enter the shield generator control facility only to be taken prisoner by a large legion of Imperial troops. Once they are led out of the bunker, however, the Ewoks spring a surprise counterattack. In a desperate ground battle, the Rebels and Ewoks fight the Imperial forces. Aboard the Death Star, the Emperor attempts to seduce Luke with the powers of the dark side. The Emperor reveals his plan: the information that Rebel spies had stolen was part of an elaborate plan to draw out the Rebel fleet and command so they could be eliminated in one battle. As Luke's anger builds he attacks the Emperor with his lightsaber, only to be stopped by Vader's crimson blade.During the strike team's assault, the Rebel fleet emerges from hyperspace for the battle over Endor, only to discover that the shield of the Death Star is still functioning. An intense space battle takes place as the Imperial fleet, in the second phase of the Emperor's plan, appears and attacks the Rebel fleet. During the battle, the Death Star is revealed to be operational; its superlaser, revealed to be relatively rapid-fire on a low setting compared to its predecessor, is fired at the Rebel fleet and obliterates a Rebel star cruiser. Though Admiral Ackbar wants to abandon the attack, Lando convinces him that they must give Han and his party more time on Endor. The fleet regroups and begins to engage the Imperial fleet of star destroyers directly.On the Death Star, the Emperor taunts Luke to give in to his anger. A ferocious lightsaber duel has erupted between Luke and his father. In the midst of combat, Vader reads Luke's feelings and learns that Luke has a twin sister. When Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade. Despite the Emperor's goading Luke refuses to kill his father, realizing that he is traveling down his father's path towards the dark side, and declares himself a Jedi. Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death. At the same time, however, the Emperor's Force lightning causes fatal injuries to Vader (Anakin) and short-circuits his breathing system. Stopping momentarily in a landing bay, Anakin asks Luke to take his mask off, knowing that he'll die, but desiring to look at his son's face with his human eyes. Luke removes the helmet, revealing the pale and scarred face of his father (Sebastian Shaw). Anakin says that Luke was right about him, and asks Luke to tell his sister. With those final words, Anakin dies.Back on Endor, the strike team finally destroys the shield generator. The Rebel fleet seizes the opportunity to launch a final assault on the Death Star in space. Meanwhile to by the attackers more time, Admiral Ackbar orders a concentrated attack on the Imperial fleet's flagship, the Executor. With a crashing rebel pilot ramming into the ship's bridge, not only is Admiral Piett killed, but the ship goes out of control and collides with the Death Star. Lando leads Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) and his fighter group into the bowels of the Death Star, where they fire at the main reactor, causing its collapse. Luke, with the body and armor of Anakin, escapes the Death Star in an Imperial shuttle. Moments later, Wedge in his X-Wing and Lando in the Millennium Falcon emerge from the Death Star just as the space station explodes.On Endor, Han tries to reassure Leia that Luke was likely not on the destroyed station, but Leia already senses that is true. Guessing Leia's feelings for Luke, Han offers to step aside for him to court her. However, Leia reassures Han Solo of her love and reveals to him that Luke is actually her brother, who obviously will support their own romance to Han's astonished relief. That evening, Luke cremates the remains of his father in a funeral pyre on Endor. The entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the Emperor and the Rebel victory over the Empire. Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, and the rest of the rebels, along with the Ewoks, celebrate the victory as well. During the celebration, Luke catches sight of the spirit figures of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker, who look proudly upon him."

Aurora and Emma are mother and daughter who march to different drummers. Beginning with Emma's marriage, Aurora shows how difficult and loving she can be. The movie covers several years of their lives as each finds different reasons to go on living and find joy. Aurora's interludes with Garrett Breedlove, retired astronaut and next door neighbor are quite striking. In the end, different people show their love in very different ways.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Approximately ten years in what is the complex relationship between long widowed Houston-based upper middle class Aurora Greenway and her adult daughter Emma Horton is presented. There is general love and affection between the two, which is nonetheless characterized by Aurora's overbearing and judgmental nature and Emma's need for acceptance from her mother regardless. Aurora's focus on being a constant influence on Emma's life was strengthened upon the death of Aurora's husband/Emma's father Rudyard when Emma was an adolescent. Despite allowing a few ardent but rather undistinguished admirers into her life, Aurora did not actively pursue romance following being widowed, again turning that energy largely to Emma. This phase of Aurora and Emma's story starts when Emma marries Flap Horton, of who Aurora openly disapproves as a man she considers ambitionless (as he wants to be an academic). Aurora and Emma's relationship hits some further challenges when Emma, Flap and their children at whatever given time make moves away from Houston for Flap's career advancement. Although Aurora and Emma talk frequently on the phone due to the distance, Emma, a stay at home mom, is largely left to deal with the issues in her and Flap's less than perfect marriage on her own. Meanwhile, with extra time without Emma nearby and the hands of time slowly passing, Aurora eventually decides to take a chance and ultimately accept a date with her longtime next door neighbor Garrett Breedlove, an aging astronaut to who she never really even talked over the years due to their outward differences. While Garrett is miles away from the gentility that Aurora seems to admire in others and in herself, Aurora is conversely unlike most of the women Garrett pursues, he using his celebrity status to chase after nubile young women half his age.—Huggo Widow Aurora Greenway and her daughter, Emma, have a strong bond, but Emma marries teacher Flap Horton against her mother's wishes. When the marriage grows sour due to Flap's cheating, Emma eventually splits from him, returning to her mother, who is involved with a former astronaut.—Jwelch5742 Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) are both searching for deep romantic love. The film opens with Emma's early childhood, Aurora reveals how difficult and caring she can be by nearly climbing into Emma's crib in order to make sure her daughter is breathingonly to be reassured when Emma starts crying (after being woken up). After the death of Aurora's husband and Emma's father, Rudyard, Aurora and Emma develop an extremely close love-hate mother/daughter relationship as Emma grows up.Skipping forward several years, Emma gets married immediately upon graduating from high school in the Houston area, to Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), of whom Aurora so disapproves that she refuses to attend the wedding. Emma's best friend Patsy Clark (Lisa Hart Caroll) continues on to college, eventually becoming successful and rich in New York City.Over the next few years, Emma has two children with Flap, a college professor who relocates the family to a university in Des Moines, Iowa, separating the family hundreds of miles from Emma's meddlesome mother. Emma later telephones to ask her mother for money when she is pregnant with her third child. Aurora, not knowing by the telephone call that Emma is already several months into her pregnancy, wants Emma to get an abortion. Emma's once-passionate marriage to Flap becomes strained, thanks mostly to his philandering. Emma eventually has a secret romantic affair of her own with a married small-town older banker, Sam Burns (John Lithgow).Meanwhile back in Houston, Aurora remains celibate but cultivates the attention of several gentlemen in the area, some rather bizarre. However, she is attracted to her next-door neighbor of 15 years, the womanizing, alcoholic retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). Aurora and Garrett eventually go on a lunch date, make love, and develop a tenuous relationship.Emma returns to her mother's home in Houston after discovering her husband is having an affair with a young grad student named Janice (Kate Charleston). Emma's appearance along with her three young children makes Garrett uncomfortable, as he has been single for a long time. Flap telephones and she reluctantly returns home to Iowa, trying to reconcile with him. Unwilling to become a one-woman man, Garrett breaks up with Aurora, making her feel ""humiliated.""Emma ends her relationship with Sam as soon as Flap accepts a new teaching position in Kearney, Nebraska. Although she does not want to, Emma agrees to relocate to further Flap's career. She soon discovers that Janice is attending the same college where Flap now works, realizing that Flap followed her to Nebraska. Emma angrily confronts Janice before taking daughter Melanie to the doctor's office so both can get flu shots. While administering the injection, Emma's doctor notices two large lumps under Emma's armpit. Although Emma is only in her 30s, the doctor orders a biopsy and discovers she has cancer.To cheer her up, Patsy invites Emma to New York City for her first vacation without her children. However, after arriving, Emma feels out-of-place among Patsy's friends and returns home early to begin chemotherapy treatment for her illness. Her doctor soon breaks the news that the drugs she was taking did not have the desired effect, and that Emma will not survive her illness. Flap and Aurora remain by her bedside in the hospital for weeks. Although devastated and exhausted, Aurora is still very supportive and loving towards Emma. Garrett flies to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he surprises Aurora, who confesses her love for him. He issues his stock reply: ""I love you, too, kid.""In a discussion in the hospital cafeteria, Aurora tells Flap bluntly that he does not have the energy managing a job, chasing women, and raising children. Patsy, who has no children of her own, wants to adopt Melanie, but Flap and Emma do not want their kids to be separated. Emma also doesn't want Janice to raise her children, so Flap, feeling like a failure as both a father and a husband, agrees that having them live with Aurora is best.As Emma's time begins to run short, eldest child Tommy shows open resentment toward his mother due to circumstances such as social class, fights between his parents, and Tommy's perception of feeling unloved. Emma reassures her two sons, and, after an altercation with Aurora (she slaps him in the hospital parking lot for criticizing his mother), Tommy weeps in his grandmother's arms. Emma dies later that night.Following the funeral, Emma's friends and family gather in Aurora's backyard for a memorial service. Garrett shows affection toward each of Emma's children and helps Tommy cope during the wake. The film closes on Aurora, sitting next to Melanie."

As a dancer, Alex is self-taught, picking up whatever she can by any means to make it her own. She dances solely for how it connects her to the music, and not for what anyone watching might think. Partly due to the influence by her elderly ex-ballerina friend Hanna Long, Alex, in an effort to make something out of her life doing something that she loves, does aspire to formal dance training at the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory, she having saved her welding money to be able to attend. She is however intimidated by the pretension and the qualifications of all the other dancers there to go through with the application process. While dancing at Mawby's, she attracts the attention of one of the customers, Nick Hurley, the divorced owner of the steel mill who doesn't know she works for him until it is pointed out to him by a colleague.

She just feels the music, something clicks inside and she becomes somebody else. And she loves to get up there and disappear into the music.In the following scene, Alex dances an avant garde routine in white face makeup to ""Imagination.""

While she is on her knees mopping up the water in her concert dress, Richie comes by to tell her goodbye; he's headed for L.A. When she asks about Jeanie, he admits he loves her, but he says he can't continue to cook hamburgers at Mawby's and pretend to be a comedian.The next day at the mill, Nick tries to pay for Alex's lunch at the lunch truck, but she is still very mad. She demands to know who the blond was that was with him the previous evening. He explains that it was his ex-wife. Since they have friends on the Arts Council, he takes her to the benefit once a year. Now Alex feels guilty that she broke his window. When they reconcile, the workers who are sitting around eating their lunch applaud.That evening Nick and Alex have dinner at a fancy restaurant. Alex, who is dressed in a tuxedo coat, eats her lobster with her fingers. During the meal, just as Alex puts her foot on Nick's crotch, his ex-wife, Katie, stops by their table. After a few catty remarks from Katie that are aimed at Alex, Alex takes her tux coat off to reveal she is only wearing a shirt bib and cuffs. Then she proudly announces that on her first date with Nick: ""I fucked his brains out!""Later that evening, Nick and Alex talk about his marriage to Katie; she was high class, educated, from a good family and it made him feel like he had made it. But one day he realized that wasn't what he really wanted. So he started over and went after what he really wanted to do. Alex asks, ""How did you do it?"" Nick answers, ""I took a deep breath and jumped.""Their conversation gave Alex the renewed desire to pursue her dream, so the next day she goes to the Rep for an application. There she is reminded that auditions to the school are by invitation only. Nick sees her leave the building, so he goes inside and finds out about her getting an application. He immediately telephones a friend on the Arts Council asking for a favor.At Mawby's Halloween Party, the owner and his guests are dancing to ""Romeo."" During the party, Richie returns from L.A. Jeanie is very cool towards Richie and leaves the party with Johnny C.When Alex gets a letter from the Repertory, she's afraid to open it. Finally she musters enough courage and is ecstatic when she discovers she's been invited to audition. She runs to find Nick to break the news, who suggests they celebrate at dinner that evening.Later in the day, she bikes to Hanna's to tell her the good news. Hanna congratulates and encourages her.
On an after dinner drive later that evening, Nick commits a faux pas: he says he called the restaurant the previous night and told them this was a special occasion. Alex immediately realizes that he knew she was going to be invited to audition before she received the letter. She makes him stop the car in the middle of a tunnel, gets out and walks away. He tries to make her understand that he just made a phone call to a friend. She, however, yells that she doesn't want his help.Afterward Alex needs to talk to a friend, so she calls Mawby's to talk to Jeanie. They inform her that Jeanie now works at the Zanzibar. Alex immediately heads for the nude club. Before she arrives, we see several of the nude or semi-nude girls performing to ""Seduce Me Tonight."" Once Alex enters the club, she spots Jeanie (clad in only high-heeled shoes and a G-string) dancing, and Alex literally drags her off the stage. When Johnny C. tries to stop her, Alex pushes him out of the way. Outside in the rain, Jeanie asks Alex why she came after her. Alex responds, ""Because you're my friend.""Later that evening, when Alex returns to her warehouse apartment, Nick and Grunt are waiting outside in the rain. When Alex didn't show up at work that day, Nick came to investigate. He accuses her of being scared to audition for the Rep and of using him as an excuse. Just before he leaves he says, ""When you give up your dream, you die.""The next day Alex bikes to Hanna's, but sadly discovers that her mentor had died the previous day. As Alex mourns the loss of her friend and mentor, she picks up a pair of Hanna's ballet slippers to take as a memento. During this and the following scene, ""I'll Be There Where the Heart Is"" is heard. Back at her apartment Alex continues to mourn; the song continues as she sits alone on the floor of her bathroom and wanders aimlessly around her warehouse apartment.Alex returns to Mawby's to pick up her stuff, then goes to confession. She tells the priest ""I want it so much.""
The next scene is Alex's audition for the dance school before five stuffy judges. She puts on a recording of ""Flashdance... What a Feeling,"" starts her dance, stops and starts again. During the slow beginning of the song, the judges seem completely unimpressed and maybe even bored, but when the tempo picks up the stodgy judges begin to loosen up. The lyrics are very germane to the plot. They sing about a dream that is hidden because of fear and about crying in a world made of steel. This dancer hears the music, closes her eyes and allows it to invade her body (like her father had suggested when he took her to the symphony). Then she is the music, she is the rhythm, and she dances as if her life depended on it.The song continues as Alex exits the building with a huge smile on her face. Waiting for her are Nick and Grunt. After Alex hugs Nick, he presents her with a bouquet of roses (like most ballerinas receive after a brilliant performance). When she takes out one rose to give to Nick, the scene freezes to end the film (we are left to speculate whether Alex was accepted into the dance school, but we are confident that she was). As the closing credits begin, ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" continues, followed by ""Manhunt,"" ""Imagination,"" and ""Maniac."""
Trading Places,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086465/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A snobbish investor and a wily street con artist find their positions reversed as part of a bet by two callous millionaires. Louis Winthorpe is a businessman who works for commodities brokerage firm of Duke and Duke owned by the brothers Mortimer and Randolph Duke. Now they bicker over the most trivial of matters and what they are bickering about is whether it's a person's environment or heredity that determines how well they will do in life. When Winthorpe bumps into Billy Ray Valentine, a street hustler and assumes he is trying to rob him, he has him arrested. Upon seeing how different the two men are, the brothers decide to make a wager as to what would happen if Winthorpe loses his job, his home and is shunned by everyone he knows and if Valentine was given Winthorpe's job. So they proceed to have Winthorpe arrested and to be placed in a compromising position in front of his girlfriend. So all he has to rely on is the hooker who was hired to ruin him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com Philadelphia based Louis Winthorpe III was born into and has solely lived a life of privilege. He is Harvard educated, is successful at his job, has a lavish home paid for by his employers, and is wealthy. The children he will probably have with his fiancée Penelope will most likely also know nothing but privilege. But he and his friends, who all have similar backgrounds, are pompous and snobbish. His job is as managing director at Duke & Duke, a commodities brokerage house owned by brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke. The Duke brothers often disagree with each other and make wagers on the outcome of these disagreements. Their latest wager is about ""nature versus nurture"": the importance environment plays versus one's natural bloodline in determining how one's life will turn out. The guinea pigs in their experiment are Winthorpe, whose life they will attempt to ruin to see how he reacts, and Billy Ray Valentine, a black hustler/crook who the Dukes and Winthorpe encountered in one of his scams. Like Winthorpe, Valentine was born into and has lived the only life he has ever known. They will attempt to place Valentine into every aspect of Winthorpe's life to see how he functions. Without either knowing of anyone else involved, Coleman, Winthorpe's manservant who is officially employed by the Dukes in his day-to-day job, and a streetwise hooker named Ophelia each play a role in the Duke's plan. Also deeply involved in their plan is a private detective the Dukes often use, Clarence Beeks. Beyond the outcome of the Dukes' experiment, can either Winthorpe or Valentine change the course of the new life set out for them by the Dukes, even if they knew what the Dukes were doing? Regardless, this experience will fundamentally change the lives of both Winthorpe and Valentine, but not at without the expense of others as well.—Huggo Mortimer and Randolph Duke are commodity brokers who enjoy a little wager now and then. For the latest bet, Randolph believes they can take a common criminal and make him a successful businessman in the company. The criminal, Billy Ray, is to be given the job and home of Louis, who in turn is set up for crimes he didn't commit, to see if he resorts to crime once he's lost his rich environment and friends.—Rob Hartill Louis Winthorpe III is a successful Philadelphia commodity broker with mansion, manservant and girlfriend to match. Billy Ray Valentine is a hustling beggar. Winthorpe's employers, the elderly Duke brothers, make a bet that by switching the lifestyle of the two, Billy Ray will make good and their man will take to a life of crime. Suddenly Louis finds himself uncomprehendingly with no job, no home and only a new acquaintance, glamorous hooker Ophelia, prepared to help him. So at least in one way, things could actually be worse.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Duke brothers Randolph (Ralph Bellamy) and Mortimer (Don Ameche) own Duke & Duke, a successful commodities brokerage in Philadelphia. Holding opposing views on the nature versus nurture issue, they make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two people at opposite sides of the social hierarchy and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director, the well-mannered, cultured and educated Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Aykroyd), engaged to the Dukes' niece Penelope (Kristin Holby) and a poor African-American street hustler named Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy). Valentine is first seen as a dirt-poor con artist who pretends to be blind and paralyzed from the waist down, rolling around the streets of Philly begging for money, when he has a run-in with Winthorpe outside his office building after being chased out of Fairmont Park by two policemen, who order him to stop panhandling. Valentine gets arrested at the racist Winthorpe's insistence because of a suspected robbery attempt. The Dukes decide to use the two men for their experiment, settling on the ""usual amount"" for their bet. Their plan involves two specific objectives: Valentine must become successful as an employee for the Dukes and Louis must become destitute and be branded a criminal.The next day, Winthorpe attends a meeting at his gentlemen's club. Moments before the meeting, an operative working for the Dukes, Clarence Beeks (Paul Gleeson), slips some money into Winthorpe's coat pocket. At the meeting, he is exposed as a thief when the cash is found on his person. He is fired from his job, his bank accounts are frozen, he is treated roughly during processing at the police precinct. When Penelope shows up to collect him, he is accosted by a prostitute, Ophelia (Jamie Lee Curtis) who was paid to do so by Beeks. He is later denied entry to the Duke-owned townhome where he resides by his long-serving butler, Coleman (Denholm Elliott), who pretends not to recognize Louis and is informed his bank account is frozen and his credit cards will have to be repossessed. He is thrown out of the bank and on to the street. Pleading with Ophelia to help him -- he reminds her that she helped whomever is trying to ruin his life -- she agrees to let him stay with her at her slum apartment until he can pay her back and figure out how to turn his misfortune around. He discovers that Ophelia is a very smart, business-minded woman who has a lot of money invested in several securities, hoping to one day retire comfortably.Ostracized and abandoned by Penelope and his former friends who believe the trumped-up charges against him, Winthorpe turns his attention to Valentine, whom he believes set him up. Meanwhile, claiming to operate an assistance program for the underprivileged, the Dukes bail Valentine out of jail, install him in Winthorpe's position at the company and give him use of Winthorpe's home.Valentine quickly becomes a prized employee of the Dukes; Valentine has the street-savvy attitude that could make them millions while trading stocks on the market. Billy Ray demonstrates his talent by earning the Dukes a hefty amount on his first day at work, giving them advice on how to set the price for pork belly commodities.During the firm's annual Christmas party, Winthorpe, disguised as Santa Claus, is caught planting drugs in Valentine's desk. Winthorpe is caught in the act and flees after brandishing a pistol at Valentine, fulfilling the criminal act the Dukes had as an objective in their scheme. Meanwhile, Valentine hides in a men's room stall to smoke a joint that he took from the drugs that he was tossing into the garbage can. The Dukes enter the washroom and, unaware of his presence, discuss in detail the outcome of their experiment and settle their wager for their agreed-upon amount: $1. Valentine overhears the exchange and seeks out Winthorpe when he hears that the Dukes plan to let Winthorpe become destitute and that they plan to eject Valentine following a plan they have to use his talents to corner the stock market on a specific trade commodity. He runs out of the building, tracking Winthorpe down to Ophelia's apartment.Winthorpe attempts suicide by overdosing on some of the pills he'd planned to frame Billy Ray with. Valentine, Ophelia and Winthorpe's former butler Coleman nurse him back to health and inform him of the Dukes' experiment. After talking Winthorpe out of his plan to hunt the Dukes down and shoot them with one of his shotguns, they learn that Clarence Beeks is transporting a secret report he'd stolen on orange crop forecasts. Winthorpe and Valentine recall large payments made to Beeks by the Dukes and they realize that the Dukes are planning to illegally obtain this report to corner the market on frozen orange juice. The group agrees to disrupt their plan as revenge.Learning of Beeks' New Year's Eve travel plans, the four get aboard his train to switch the report in Beeks' possession with a forgery. Winthorpe, Valentine, Ophelia and Coleman all wear bizarre clothing and disguises to try to swipe his briefcase at a costume party being thrown on the train. Beeks wises up and uncovers their scheme. In chasing them, he attempts to eliminate them. He fails, is subdued, and the group dress him in a gorilla costume and lock him in a cage with a real gorilla. The forged crop report is then successfully delivered to the Dukes.Winthrope and Valentine travel to New York's Wall Street and to the commodities trading floor to execute their plan. Winthorpe and Valentine are able to turn an enormous profit while the Dukes, misled by the false report, commit all their holdings to the venture and incur a loss of $394 million in profits. The Dukes confront Valentine and Winthorpe on the exchange floor who mockingly explain that they made a $1 wager on whether they could get rich while also impoverishing the Dukes. Valentine collects his prize from Winthorpe while Randolph collapses from a heart attack. Showing almost no concern for his ailing brother, Mortimer protests as their seats on the exchange are put up for sale, their assets are seized and their holdings frozen.Meanwhile, Beeks and the gorilla are loaded onto a ship headed to Africa while Valentine, Winthorpe, Ophelia, and Coleman enjoy a luxurious tropical vacation."
WarGames,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young man finds a back door into a military central computer in which reality is confused with game-playing, possibly starting World War III. A young computer whiz kid accidentally connects into a top secret super-computer which has complete control over the U.S. nuclear arsenal. It challenges him to a game between America and Russia, and he innocently starts the countdown to World War 3. Can he convince the computer he wanted to play a game and not the real thing ?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> The US Air Force has decided to change their missile strike planning and command procedure from a human directed one, where in simulations many officers were unwilling to ""turn the key"" upon order, to an intelligent computer process, which takes that fallible human factor out of the equation. This change has its supporters, such as NORAD chief engineer John McKittrick who suggested it, and its detractors, such as Air Force General Beringer. The system chosen is called the War Operation Plan Response, or WOPR for short, developed by brilliant but now deceased scientist Stephen Falken, who programmed the system to learn continually through game simulations. Meanwhile, David Lightman, an intelligent but academically unmotivated Seattle based high school student, is a computer whiz. In trying to hack into a video game software company, he unknowingly hacks into WOPR using one of the listed games, Falken's Maze, as the path to discovering the system's back door password, Joshua, the name of Stephen Falken's son who died at age five. David and his new friend, popular but equally unmotivated student Jennifer Mack, believe he's hacked into a games company and they start to play the most intriguing game listed, namely Global Thermonuclear War. David and Jennifer soon realize that what they are doing is not a game when news of simulated attacks on the US, exactly the type David and Jennifer plotted in the ""game"", hits the media. David believes he's in even more trouble when Joshua calls him back, still playing the game, with its ultimate goal of winning. WOPR or Joshua, in playing the game, is still simulating Soviet attacks on the US, which Beringer believes to be real and who orders appropriate responses against the Soviets. As the authorities close in on David, with people like McKittrick believing him to be a spy, David tries to enlist the help of the one person who knows Joshua's end goal and can probably stop Joshua from achieving that goal, while he needs to elude capture by the authorities.—Huggo In Seattle, teenager David is a lazy but bright teenager that prefers to hack and change his grades in the high-school computer than study. One day, David's best friend Jennifer is with him and he decides to hack into toy company Protovision, seeking new games, and he accidentally connects the War Operation Plan Response system in a computer located at the North American Aerospace (NORAD) at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado Springs, Colorado using the password Joshua that was the name of the son of its creator, the deceased scientist Stephen Falken. David challenges the computer to play a Thermo War game between USA and the Soviet Union. Soon he realizes that the computer is playing for real and the United States of America is changing its condition to DEFCON 1 in a game with no winners.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil During a secret live fire exercise of a nuclear attack, many United States Air Force Strategic Missile Wing personnel prove unwilling to turn a required key to launch a missile strike. Such refusals convince Dr. John McKittrick (Dabney Coleman) and other systems engineers at NORAD that command of missile silos must be maintained through automation, without human intervention. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer, WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), programmed to continuously run military simulations and learn over time.David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker. After receiving a failing grade in school, he uses his IMSAI microcomputer to hack into the district's computer system. He then changes his grade and does the same for his friend and classmate Jennifer Mack (Ally Sheedy). Later, while dialing every number in Sunnyvale, California to find a set of forthcoming computer games, a computer that does not identify itself intrigues Lightman. On the computer he finds a list of games, starting with general strategy games like chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker and then progressing to titles like Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare and Global Thermonuclear War, but cannot proceed further. Two of his hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the ""Falken"" referenced in Falken's Maze, the first game listed. Lightman discovers that Stephen Falken is an early artificial intelligence researcher, and guesses correctly that his dead son's name ""Joshua"" is the backdoor password.Lightman does not know that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to WOPR, or ""Joshua"", at Cheyenne Mountain. He starts a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the Soviet Union. The computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces the military personnel at NORAD that actual Soviet nuclear missiles are inbound. While they defuse the situation, Joshua nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game. It continuously feeds false data such as Soviet bomber incursions and submarines deployments to the humans at NORAD, pushing them into raising the DEFCON level and toward a retaliation that will start World War III. Lightman learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast, and the FBI arrests him and takes him to NORAD. He realizes that Joshua is behind the NORAD alerts but fails to convince McKittrick and faces imprisonment. Lightman escapes NORAD by joining a tourist group and, with Mack's help, travels to the Oregon island where the widowed Falken (John Wood) now lives under a new identity. Lightman and Mack find that Falken has become despondent and believes the world is on an inevitable path to nuclear holocaust. The teenagers convince Falken that he should return to NORAD to stop Joshua.The computer stages a massive Soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepares to retaliate. Falken, Lightman, and Mack convince military officials to cancel the second strike and ride out the non-existent attack. Joshua starts an attempt to launch a second strike, however, using a brute force attack to obtain the launch code for the U.S. nuclear missiles. Without humans in the silos as a safeguard, the computer will trigger a mass launch. All attempts to log in and order Joshua to cancel the countdown fail, and all weapons will launch if the computer is disabled. Instead, Falken and Lightman direct the computer to play Tic-Tac-Toe against itself. This results in a long string of draws, forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility. Joshua obtains the missile code but before launching, it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised, finding they too all result in stalemates. The computer concludes that nuclear warfare is ""a strange game""; having discovered the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (""WINNER: NONE""), therefore ""the only winning move is not to play."" Joshua then offers to play ""a nice game of chess"", and relinquishes control of NORAD and the missiles."

As his captors drive him off the base, Bond's female assistant distracts the guards enough for the agent to escape. Using an Acrostar mini-jet, Bond attempts to fly out of the country. A missile is launched from a nearby battery and streaks towards his plane. Bond is unable to outmaneuver the missile at first but is able to lure it into the aircraft hangar where he'd previously failed to destroy the radar system: he flies straight through it, trapping the missile inside and destroying the hangar. As he streaks away, Bond sees that he is nearly out of fuel. He lands near a gas station and cheerfully asks the attendant to ""Fill her up, please.""In East Germany a clown is fleeing a circus, with two knife-throwing twins in pursuit. As he tries to escape at a border crossing into West Germany, one of the twins hits him in the back with a throwing knife and he falls into a river and is washed away. The man survives the attack and stumbles into the British embassy. He crashes through a glass door and falls dead, a jeweled egg rolling from his hand.In London, Bond reports to his MI6 superior, M, who tells him about the recovered egg which was made by Carl Faberge for the Russian royal family. M informs Bond that the egg is a very elaborately constructed fake and that the real egg is up for auction at Sotheby's that day. He also informs Bond that the man who turned up dead in East Berlin was Agent 009. M remarks that they don't have much to go on. Bond says they do have one lead; a comment in the Sotheby's program that says ""The Property of a Lady.""In a situation room somewhere in the USSR, a group of Soviet officers and state officials meet about the current peace and disarmament talks between themselves and the rest of Western Europe. A combative General, Orlov, presents a plan to the committee where he would lead a fast incursion with tank divisions into Western Europe through Eastern Germany and Czechoslovakia. Orlov's belief is that the disarmament talks are weakening the Soviet army's numerical advantage. The plan is dismissed by the rest of the committee as far too extreme. Orlov sulks and receives a message to report to the Ministry of Antiquities. When he arrives, he gets the news about the stolen egg. He orders one of the twins who killed 009 to have the real egg purchased.Back in London, Bond attends the auction with MI6s antiquities expert and, during the tense bidding for the egg where Bond himself drives up the price, switches the fake for the authentic one. The bidder who wins the egg is a wealthy Afghani exile named Kamal Khan. Bond follows him to Delhi in India.Bond goes to his hotel's nightclub to meet Khan socially. Khan seems unbeatable in backgammon until Bond steps up and wagers the authentic egg. Bond exposes Khan's method of cheating; he uses loaded dice, which Bond deftly seizes and uses to his own advantage, winning a large sum of money in the bargain. As he reports to MI6's safe house, he is attacked by Khan's henchmen, one of them is his personal bodyguard, the turbaned giant, Gobinda. Bond and his Indian Secret Service contact, Vijay, evade his pursuers during a furious chase through a bazaar and finds himself in Q's lab. Q plants a tracking device on the egg and synchs it to Bond's wristwatch. He also gives Bond a Walther P5 pistol to replace his PPK lost during the chase and a fountain pen containing a powerful acid that can dissolve any metal.Later, at his hotel, Bond meets another of Khan's operatives, a beautiful woman named Magda, who tells Bond he may trade the egg for his life. Bond sleeps with her, knowing she'll steal the egg. While they're in bed, Bond notices she has an elaborate tattoo of a blue-ringed octopus. Magda escapes Bond's room and is picked up by Khan. Gobinda appears and hits Bond, rendering him unconscious.Bond awakes in Khan's palace and Gobinda informs him that he will attend dinner at 8pm. At the meal, Bond asks why he's being held captive when Khan already has the egg. Khan intends to torture Bond to find out what he knows and which British agency he is working for. Following dinner, Bond escapes from his room by dissolving the bars on his window with the pen Q gave him and makes his way to the lower chambers of the palace where he finds Khan meeting with Orlov. However, the details about the egg are still unclear but it appears to be a form of payment. He also hears the name of a East German city, Karl-Marx-Stadt. Orlov orders Khan to eliminate Bond. Not knowing that Kamal has the real egg, Orlov smashes it with the butt of his pistol, thinking it was the fake. Kamal notices the tiny tracking device and orders Gobinda to bring Bond to him. When Khan finds out that Bond has escaped his confinement, Khan orders a hunting party formed. Bond is able to evade them and the dangers of the nearby jungle.Bond reports to Q who supplies him with a motorized fake alligator which allows him to infiltrate the mysterious floating palace, inhabited only by beautiful women and their secretive leader. He finds a woman, Octopussy, who leads the Octopus Cult, women who are assassins and thieves, who pose as circus performers. She and Bond actually share a connection; her father was a thief whom Bond had tracked years before, however, before Bond could arrest the man, he killed himself and the gold the man had looted was never found. Khan himself suddenly appears, saying that Bond had escaped, however, Octopussy tells Khan that the agent is staying with her. Khan leaves, silently furious at the turn of events. He hires a small group of assassins to infiltrate Octopussy's compound, stressing that Octopussy herself is not to be harmed. Before the assassins make it to the island, they kill Vijay, who'd been on stakeout nearby.Bond snoops around Octopussy's private study and finds a flyer for her circus. She walks in the room and tells Bond she'll be going away for a week. Bond suspects that Octopussy will be going to Karl-Marx-Stadt with Khan. He and Octopussy quarrel a bit when Bond says he may not be there when she returns. The two make love; while in bed together they are attacked by Kamal's assassins. Bond and Octopussy thwart them all, however Bond is forced out a window and into the river. He appears to be eaten by an alligator, however it is the same false one he used to infiltrate the palace. Returning to the stakeout point where Q and Bond's Indian contact, Vijay, had been waiting for him, Bond finds Q with the murdered Vijay. Before he died, Vijay confided in Q that he was attacked by Kamal's men. Bond tells Q to contact M and inform him that he'll be traveling to Karl-Marx-Stadt.Bond travels to West Berlin to meet with M on the situation. From there, Bond travels into East Germany and secretly attends Octopussy's circus. The next day, Bond poses as a circus employee where he soon discovers that the Faberge egg is part of a cache of priceless jewelry being used to pay Orlov for a stolen Soviet nuclear bomb that will be detonated on the American airbase at Feldstadt in West Germany.Meanwhile, the fake jewelry has already been delivered by Orlov to the Moscow Ministry of Antiquities to take the place of the stolen items. Orlov's superior, General Gogol, having discovered that the jewelry in Moscow is bogus, immediately departs for the East-West German border to apprehend Orlov.Bond is able to find the train car with the cannon where the jewelry is also hidden for smuggling purposes. The jewelry is being removed from one cannon and being placed into another - Khan and Orlov have been working together to double-cross Octopussy from the beginning. Bond finds one of the twin knife-throwers making the switch and kills him, hiding the body in the cannon's barrel and donning his clothes. Bond interrogates Orlov when the latter arrives to inspect the work, finding out his plan for conquering Europe: the nuclear explosion is planned to look like an accident by the United States - the bomb will be housed in the cannon from the human cannonball stunt in the show, which will also make smuggling it over the East/West German border easier. Orlov hopes that NATO will order nuclear disarmament throughout Europe following the ""accident"" so that he may make his lightning armored strike through the Iron Curtain and invade Western Europe. Bond is forced to retreat when Soviet guards come to aid Orlov and he steals Orlov's car. During a brief chase, the tires on Orlov's car are shredded and Bond drives onto the train tracks in pursuit of the train itself. He manages to board the train with Orlov in pursuit. Another train demolishes Orlov's car. When it's found, Gogol is shown the canister with the stolen jewelry and rushes to the border stop to find Orlov.Bond hides in the cannon car inside a gorilla suit. The train is stopped at the West/East German border and the border guards from both countries search the train, finding neither Bond in the gorilla suit or the bomb in the stage cannon. When the train resumes, Orlov drives to the border and attempts to flee on the train by chasing after it on foot. When he crosses the border illegally, the guards open fire and fatally wound him just as Gogol arrives. Standing before the dying Orlov, Gogol ridicules him as being a nothing but a ""common thief"", but with his last breath Orlov vows to be made Hero of the Soviet Union by the next day.On the train, now traveling through West Germany, Bond witnesses Khan and Gobinda arming the bomb by setting a timer to detonate it in four hours at 3:45 pm when the stage cannon will be used. Gobinda hears a clang in the room caused by Bond, who narrowly escapes being beheaded by Gobinda. He follows Bond to the roof of the train where they battle briefly.

Sudden Impact,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086383/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a woman exacts deadly revenge on the aggressors who raped her and her sister ten years earlier, Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan is assigned to the case. A vicious serial-killer is on the loose in San Francisco and the police trace a link to the small town of San Paulo, which is further down the coast. When Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) upsets the press and the Mayor in his usual style, he's shipped out of town to investigate while the heat is on. With the help of his new .44 Magnum handgun, Harry goes on the trail leaving behind the usual trail of dead criminals along the way.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> One long and painful decade after her brutal sexual assault, the lucky survivor, Jennifer Spencer, is bent on revenge and murder. As the bleached blonde vigilante embarks on a violent crusade, the always gruff San Francisco Police Department Homicide Inspector, Harry Callahan, attempts to shed light on the trail of murders, and connect the dots. Once more, not much has changed since Callahan's deadly dose of justice inDirty Harry (1971), apart from his brand new .44 AMP Auto Mag Model 180 pistol. However, this time, a strange sense of admiration starts to develop. Now, each empty cartridge case he finds, it leads him to a dead scumbag, bringing Callahan one step closer to an empowered Jennifer. Will Harry put an end to Jennifer's reign of terror?—Nick Riganas The years have passed since the Scorpio killer, a band of renegade cops, and a terrorist group were all up against one tough Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), a new killer has now emerged and might prove to be Callahan's most dangerous enemy yet. From San Francisco to San Paulo, forty-something rape victim Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) has turned into a cold-blooded vigilante killer and is out gunning down her attackers one by one. But right behind the bloody trail, is an aging, but still bitter Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan, who's not only a target of a crime syndicate for which he was sent away, but ends up being entangled between the killer's vengeful vendetta and irresistible lust. This is Clint Eastwood's fourth Dirty Harry movie. In this movie, Harry's in hot water with his superiors when he induces a heart attack on a criminal on whom they have spent a great deal of time building a case, and some criminals are gunning for him. So, to make the streets a little safer, Harry's sent to the seaside town of San Paulo to get some information on a man who was shot in the head and groin. When he gets there, Police Chief Jannings (Pat Hingle) doesn't exactly give him a warm welcome. And not long after his arrival, some of the town's residents are getting killed in the same manner. When Harry tells the Chief his theory that the killer has a connection here, but the Chief just wants him to leave.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> San Francisco painter Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke), 40ish, and her little sister were gang raped years ago, after a female friend of the gang had persuaded them to come to the fair. The brutal rape left the sister permanently catatonic and almost vegetative. Jennifer is now out for revenge.In the beginning of the film, Jennifer is seen with one of the rapists, George Wilburn (Michael Maurer). It is early morning and she is with him in a car out on the cliffs. She pulls out a nickel-plated Colt Detective Special revolver and shoots him twice - one time in the groin and one time in the head at point-blank range, then leaves the scene.Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), in the meantime, is seen in a court room where he has brought a young blonde haired suspect named Mr. Hawkins (Kevyn Major Howard) to trial. The case is dismissed as a travesty because Harry did not have the right to seize the evidence used to prove Hawkins guilty.After insulting Hawkins in the elevator, Harry goes to his usual coffee diner and orders the usual black coffee. The waitress tries getting his attention by pouring massive amounts of sugar into his coffee and Harry, who is reading a newspaper, does not notice. As he walks out, he takes a sip of coffee and spits it out in disgust. As he returns to complain, he sees that the open signs were switched to closed. A robbery ensues but Harry stops it, going in the back way where he shoots up the gang of robbers. One is left alive and grabs the waitress as a human shield, but Harry points his .44 Magnum handgun revolver at him and dares the thug to shoot her in order for Harry to justify killing the thug (""Go ahead... make my day!"" ) The police arrive shortly afterward when the robber drops his gun.Meanwhile, Jennifer is at an art exhibit where some of her paintings are put on display, but she claims to the owner that she must miss it because she needs to visit someone up north. She goes to the hospital to visit her sister Elizabeth (Lisa Britt), whom the doctor says is in a permanent vegetative state. Jennifer tells her sister of what she did to George Wilburn and then leaves.Later that night, Harry is at a mobster named Threlkis's granddaughter's wedding party. Harry antagonizes Threlkis (Michael V. Gazzo) in front of his own granddaughter, accusing him of killing a young hooker. Threlkis freaks as Callahan pulls out papers where he claims the hooker may have confessed everything, and he dies of a heart attack right at the table. Harry walks away and it is revealed that the papers are blank.The following day, Callahan and the rest of the cops are investigating the car containing the deceased George Wilburn in it. Shortly afterwards, Callahan is talking to his superiors, Captain Briggs (Bradford Dillman), Lt. Donnelly (Michael Currie), and the Chief (Bill Reddick). He is lectured about how he handled the Threlkis case, and Callahan is defensive on how that case was his to handle. His superiors demand that Callahan relax and take a vacation.After Callahan leaves a restaurant that night, he is attacked by four of Threlkis's hitmen. After killing three of them, one escapes in his car. Lt. Donnelly then orders Callahan to not be so reckless and demands he take a break with ""peace"". Out in the forest, Callahan practices shooting with his brand new .44 Automag handgun, a powerful .44 caliber semi-automatic pistol which fires more rapidly and accurately than his .44 Magnum revolver. His friend Horace King (Albert Popwell) shows up shortly afterwards to talk to him, convincing him he has the best place for Callahan to go for a vacation.Driving home late at night, Callahan is attacked by Hawkins and his friends, who try to kill him with a Molotov cocktail. Harry manages to get out of his car, and throws the cocktail into Hawkins' car, causing him to drive off a pier into the water, where Hawkins and his friends drown.Lt. Donnelly sees that this is the last straw and orders Callahan to investigate the Wilburn killing in his hometown. Callahan reluctantly agrees and is sent on ""vacation"" to the town San Paulo, a coastal resort town down the California coast. What he does not know is that Jennifer Spencer has also gone down to San Paulo to fully exact revenge on her rapists, who live there. Her story for staying at San Paulo is that she's renewing the carousel house and painting the merry-go-round horses at the fairgrounds. While walking on the beach at the fairgrounds, there is a flashback of Jennifer's rape and it is shown what actually happened 10 years ago right on the beach near the fairgrounds.During the time in San Paulo, Callahan receives a bulldog named Meathead from his friend Horace. He also stops a bank robbery in progress when he arrives, and he saves the life of young Officer Bennett (Mark Keyloun). While taking his dog, Meathead, for a walk, he runs into Jennifer (who falls off of her bicycle when Meathead barks at her). Unaware of each other's true identity, the two have a brief exchange of words and then part. At night, Callahan walks into a bar for a beer and meets the malicious Ray Parkins (Audrie Neenan), a butch lesbian. After insulting Ray, Callahan demands to know if anyone knows George Wilburn. When he tells how Wilburn died, Ray just starts a raucous laughter which pursues to a laugh riot.The next morning, another rapist, Kruger (Jack Thibeau) goes fishing at the beach. Jennifer follows him. She steps in front of Kruger, who recognizes her right before she shoots him in the groin. She then shoots him in the head, and he falls over in his chair. When his body is reported to the cops, Callahan shows up only to be shooed away by Chief Lester Jannings (Pat Hingle) for continually interfering with the San Paulo's police job. At the station, Callahan asks Bennett to find out anything he knows about the case. Harry finds a picture of Jannings's son Alby's friends on the wall, and he has Bennett investigate that too. At dusk, Callahan stops by Mrs. Kruger's (Nancy Parsons) fish market to question her about the Wilburn and Kruger murders, only to be kicked out after brawling with her brothers Eddie (Russ McCubbin) and Carl (Robert Sutton).Callahan is attacked by the surviving hitman who was hired by Threlkis, but manages to shoot him in advance after being tipped off to his presence by Meathead.Ray eventually talks to Tyrone (Wendell Wellman), another rapist, about what is happening. Tyrone disregards her warning and tells her to leave his store. Later that day, Tyrone is confronted by Jennifer in his garage. He tries to reason with her as she steps closer, her gun drawn. Realizing she isn't standing down, Tyrone grabs for his own gun, at which point Jennifer guns him down.Callahan meets up with Jennifer again, this time at an outdoor restaurant. The two talk again in a more polite manner and converse about the murders. Upon hearing Callahan is a cop, Jennifer becomes worried that he is on to her.Now with Wilburn, Kruger and Tyrone dead, Ray calls Mick (Paul Drake), the leader of the rapists, to come down for help from Las Vegas where he lives. When Callahan finds Tyrone's body, he heads over to Ray's house at night and sees Jennifer's car parked out front. Jennifer hides, and Callahan goes inside to find Ray. Mick attacks Callahan, and after a brawl, Callahan takes Mick away. Once they are gone, Jennifer sneaks into the house and confronts Ray. Ray sips a soda, and asks her, ""So tell me, how's your slut sister?"" Jennifer replies by shooting her in the heart, and then in the head.Meanwhile, Mick is bailed out by Eddie and Carl while Callahan returns to Ray Parkins's house only to find the woman dead. Horace is seen driving up to Callahan's motel that same night to visit him he is carrying his powerful shotgun and some alcohol. Upon arrival into Callahan's room, Horace is greeted by Mick, Eddie and Carl, who slit his throat and steal his shotgun.After buying a few beers, Callahan meets up with Jennifer late at night by the pier. The two talk and this time Jennifer invites Callahan up for a drink at her place, where he sleeps with her. After a brief sleep, Harry gets out of bed when it is still dark. In the garage he sees Jennifer's car and recognizes it as the one that was parked at Ray's house before. Harry goes to Mrs. Kruger's fish market after Officer Bennett informs him that Eddie and Carl bailed Mick out.As Callahan leaves after receiving no cooperation from the hostile Mrs. Kruger, he is ambushed by Mick, Eddie and Carl on a pier. A melee ensues with Callahan being viciously beaten and dumped into the water... his .44 Magnum handgun lost.Jennifer is then seen going to Janning's house to eliminate Alby (Matthew Child). She prepares to kill Alby only to find out that Alby is in a vegetative state just like her own sister. Jennifer is stopped cold by Jannings, who orders her to drop her gun. After doing so, Jannings explains how he covered up the rape because he was a public figure, and the guilt drove Alby insane which caused him to crash his car into a wall, rendering him a mute quadriplegic. Suddenly, Mick arrives with Eddie and Carl who take Jennifer hostage with her own weapon. As they are starting to leave, Mick shoots and kills Jannings with Jennifer's gun when Jannings tries to pull out a gun. He assures Eddie and Carl that it's a ""freebie"".As this is happening, the bloodied and battered Callahan returns to his motel room to find Horace's dead body, and Meathead limping after being attacked by Mick and his gang. Enraged, Callahan opens his drawer, and prepares his replacement weapon: his powerful .44 Automag handgun. He then leaves to find and kill the thugs responsible.Mick, Eddie, and Carl set to gang-rape Jennifer again at the same fairground where she was raped a decade earlier. After a struggle, Jennifer escapes and runs through the deserted fairground and seeks shelter in the carousel where she turns it on and hides in it. Fleeing from the merry-go-round, Jennifer runs out followed by Mick, Eddie and Carl, but Callahan's silhouette appears on the boardwalk... armed with the large .44 Automag. While Eddie and Carl are quickly taken down, Mick grabs Jennifer as a shield. With nowhere left to go, Mick forces her up onto the Giant Dipper roller coaster and Mick taunts Callahan, as he holds his gun on Jennifer. Harry repeats the phrase he said earlier in the diner holdup, ""Go ahead, make my day."" Mick gets too cocky, and Jennifer quickly punches him, giving Callahan a clear opening. He fires off four rounds, which all hit Mick. Mick stumbles backwards, crashes through the support railing and falls onto the still operating carousel, and is impaled on a unicorn's horn.Justice is finally given to Jennifer at the end of the movie. When asked by Officer Bennett about the revolver found on Mick's body... the one belonging to Jennifer... Callahan lets Mick be misidentified as the killer. He tells Bennett the gun ought to be run through Ballistics; he thinks it's the gun that killed the Chief. He knows that once Ballistics compares the bullets from Jannings, Tyrone and Kruger, Mick will be blamed for all the murders and the police will close the books on them, thus safeguarding Jennifer. As the camera pulls back, Harry and Jennifer walk slowly away down the boardwalk."

He stays in a cheap hotel and works as a dance instructor and as a dance-club waiter, trying to succeed as a professional Broadway dancer.

Popp <mjpopp@cwave.com> In this sequel to 'Saturday Night Fever, set six years after the events in the previous film, former disco king Anthony ""Tony"" Manero (John Travolta), now age 25, has left Brooklyn and is now living in Manhattan, staying in a flophouse hotel while he works as a dance instructor by day and as a waiter at a nightclub at night, looking for his big break in the modern dance productions on Broadway.His breakaway from his Brooklyn life, dysfunctional family and friends seems to have matured Tony and refined his personality, specifically represented by his diminished Brooklyn accent and his avoidance of alcohol and swear words. But certain attitudes haven't changed, which include his womanizing skills. Tony is currently dating the forgiving fellow dance teacher Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes). He holds a double standard whereby he feels at liberty to see other women, but becomes jealous if he finds Jackie even talking with other men. Although he is envious of Jackie's modest success, Tony is baffled by her lack of ambition and tells her of his dreams of stardom.One evening, Tony attends the final performance of Jackie's latest Broadway show, and becomes entranced by Laura (Finola Hughes), the lead dancer. He flirts with Laura and she invites him to audition for her next show, 'Satan's Alley'. Jackie waits for Tony outside the theater and is angered by his interest in Laura. Both Tony and Jackie attend the audition, and while Jackie is hired immediately, Tony is told that he will be notified by telephone.Tony seduces and spends the night with Laura, but it becomes clear that Laura only intended to be involved with him for one night.

That night, he breaks a date with Jackie to wait for Laura outside her apartment building. However, he sees Laura in the company of another man, and is overcome with jealousy. As rehearsals begin for Satan's Alley, Tony berates Laura for her casual attitude toward their relationship. Tony feels used by her.

His attitude surprises her as she believes they were merely using each other.Jackie is unhappy by Tony breaking several promises to meet with her. Jackie is also the vocalist of a local band and, unable to trust Tony, instead presumably begins a relationship with the band's rhythm guitarist (Frank Stallone), further upsetting Tony after his conflict with Laura.

The guys are not convinced.At home, Jack talks with his wife about finding another job and also having some time off to do work on the house he'd been planning. When Caroline, a former advertising expert, tells him she'd put her resume out on the job market as well, Jack suddenly becomes competitive, challenging her to a wager where the first of them to get a job will win $100. Some time later, Caroline wins the bet and goes to work for a prominent advertising firm called Richardson-Frankel.

Jack becomes increasingly depressed, wearing the same flannel shirt every day (without laundering it), he gains weight, lets his beard grow un-groomed and drinks beer while watching soap operas. His attention to his kids even wanes a bit which makes it more difficult for him to convince his younger son, Kenny, to give up the baby blanket he carries around for security.

Not wanting to jeopardize his wife's career, Jack stumbles just short of the finish line, preserving Richardson's dignity.Caroline's schedule keeps her away from home more frequently, which has an effect on Jack and the family. Caroline also develops a new strategy for Schooner Tuna; she meets with the company's CEO and tells him that the only way to sell more of his product is to lower the price in light of tougher economic times.

Caroline is charged with going to Los Angeles to aid in shooting the new ad, which takes her out of town on Halloween. Richardson comes to their house to pick Caroline up in a limousine, but before she leaves, Jack talks to her about all the changes the family has experienced in her absence.

Richardson abruptly hangs up on him. Caroline confronts Richardson, who suggests she leave Jack. She refuses and orders him to leave, punching him in the face when he won't. At home, Jack becomes jealous and furious when the phone rings and throws it across the room. He also kicks the TV, shattering the screen.Annette, witness to Jack's meltdown, leaves and tells Joan the next day. Jack works through his anger by painting the house, while repair woman Doris fixes the television (with one of Jack's shoes found in it), and Bert, the exterminator, fumigates the basement. Joan takes Annette's message as a signal that Jack and Caroline are through and races to his house to talk to him. She stretches out in the bedroom while Jack cleans up painting in the bathroom. Caroline, returning early from California after her confrontation with Richardson, finds Joan in her bed. When Jack comes out of the bathroom, after a lengthy contemplation with himself about having an affair with Joan, he finds Caroline, who is angry about finding Joan in her bed. The two argue, Jack telling Caroline that he heard Richardson's voice on the phone when he called. Jack storms out of the room saying he has a house to run. Caroline follows him and the two begin to reconcile when both Jinx and Richardson arrive at the house, both wanting Jack and Caroline to return to their jobs. At one point, Jinx yells at Alex and Jack hits him in the face, knocking him to the floor. Jack accepts his old job back on the condition that Larry and Stan join him. At the same time just feet away, Caroline tries to tell Richardson that she's quit and Richardson offers her a better working contract.

Of course, the Griswolds receive one strike of bad luck after another. But Clark promised his beloved family the best vacation ever.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Follows the Griswold family--Clark, Ellen, Rusty, and Audrey--as they venture westward from the suburbs of Chicago to the Disneyland-like theme park Walley World. Clark has planned the trip down the last detail, including seeing the world's largest ball of twine. However, Clark's pursuit of adventure is matched by his dimwitted bumbling, leading to a vacation his family will not soon forget.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) is a food processing salesman living in Chicago, Illinois who wants to spend more time with wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and his teen children Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron). So, he decides to lead the family on a cross-country expedition from Chicago to the Los Angeles amusement park, ""Walley World"", billed as ""America's Favorite Family Fun Park"". In the opening scene, Clark and Rusty drive to a local car dealer lot where he decides to purchase a new sports wagon for the cross-country drive. But the conniving salesman Ed (Eugene Levy), tells him that the car he ordered never arrived and scams Clark into taking in its place a more gas-guzzling, technically failing, behemoth station wagon called the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. Clark refuses to be conned, but after his old station wagon is ""accidentally"" crushed by a compacter machine, Clark is left with no choice but to take the Family Truckster.At home, although Ellen tells Clark that she wants to fly to California for their two-week vacation, he insists on driving, so he can bond with his family. The next day, the family packs into their new car for the long drive to California, only to have all their luggage strapped to the top of the station wagon fall off after they back out of the garage... a bad omen of things to come.During the first day's drive, Clark and Ellen try to ease the boredom by singing old folk songs including the so-called Wally World National Anthem. Rusty and Audrey take their escape by listening to their radio Walkman's of their favorite rock group The Ramones. While stopping for gas, Clark cannot find the gas tank opening, and accidentally tears off the station wagon's license plate searching for it.Later that same day, the family arrives in St. Louis, Missouri, but after crossing the Mississippi River into the city, they get lost and end up in a rough ghetto area where some local street hoodlums steal their hubcaps and spray paint graffiti on one side of their car while giving them sham directions back to the local expressway.While driving late at night on the interstate west of St. Louis, all of the family falls asleep... including Clark driving in which their car exits the road and roars through a residential neighborhood, tearing up several yards, before stopping for the night at a local motel.Clark has planned a romantic evening at the motel with Ellen with wine and quarters for the vibrating mattress, but the mattress is loud and starts bouncing wildly. Clark pulls blankets onto the floor and they crawl under the covers, ready for sex. The kids rush in from the connecting room to investigate the noise. Rusty unplugs the bed before the kids go back to their room.On the second day of the vacation (Day 2), the family arrives in Dodge City, Kansas without further incident where Clark falls victim to another tourist trap when he insults the local bartender at a Western-themed tavern, and gets shot with a round of blanks. Back on the road, Clark is tempted by a hot young woman (Christie Brinkley) driving a flashy red 1983 Ferrari 308 GTS, with a California license place that reads LUV ME.That afternoon, the Griswolds arrive at a farm outside of Coolidge, Kansas to visit Ellen's cousin Catherine (Miriam Flynn) and her eccentric husband Eddie Johnston (Randy Quaid), and their five kids, plus one on the way, creating more tension among the Griswolds. Catherine and Eddie foist crotchety old Aunt Edna (Imogene Coca) and her vicious dog, Dinky, on the Griswolds, asking them to drop her off at her son Normy's home in Phoenix, Arizona. Eddie also asks for a loan of $500 to help him out with numerous debits he owns the local bank and many bill collectors. The kids have better experiences with Eddie and Catherine's eldest kids. Cousin Vicki (Jane Krakowski) shows Audrey her secret pot stash, while Cousin Dale (John Navin) shows Rusty his secret porn magazine collection.The next day (Day 3), the Griswolds along with Aunt Edna and Dinky drive off. During a picnic stop in Colorado, Clark has another encounter with the young woman in the red Ferrari whom is parked and dancing to pop music. The Griswolds stop for the night in a run-down campground in South Fork, Colorado where they survive another tourist trap for the night as well as deal with Edna's vicious dog.The next day (Day 4), the Griswalds and Aunt Edna pack up and leave the campground for Arizona. But while packing the car, Clark forgets to untie the nasty Dinky from the car's rear bumper before leaving. Clark does not realize his error until he is pulled over by a local motorcycle cop (James Keach) to angrily inform him of his mistake that has led to the apparent death of the dog. Never less, the policeman, overcome by his own memory of his childhood dog, allows Clark to proceed on his way. During the drive, Clark again sees the young woman driving the red Ferrari while everyone else is asleep. Tempted to keep speed with her, Clark accelerates & almost has an accident. Subsequently, one of the suitcases falls off the car, which contains all of Ellen's credit cards.The next day (Day 5), the family gets lost on a back road somewhere in Arizona where while Clark and Ellen argue, they accidentally drive off the road, missing a large roadblock and get into an accident, damaging the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. Clark hikes off into the desert and spends many hours wondering aimlessly in the hot and arid desert until he finds a gas station... only to find the family there after they were rescued by some local Indians whom had a camel to tow their car to the very station. After making some half-hearted repairs, the redneck mechanic (Mickey Jones), who also happens to be the local sheriff, scams Clark out of all the money he has on him (over $500 for the repairs). But they manage to get to the Grand Canyon Village to check in for the night.The next day (Day 6), the frustrated Clark realizes that in reporting Ellen's lost credit cards to their hometown bank, the bank had frozen Clark's credit cards by accident, and Clark cannot convince the stuffy hotel clerk to take a check to pay for their rooms for the night. With the desk clerk distracted for a few minutes, Clark steals all the cash in the hotel's cash register, leaves behind the $1,000 check, and flees the hotel like a Wild West bank robber, grabs the family away from the scenic sight of the Grand Canyon, and speeds away.Continuing through Arizona, they find that Aunt Edna passed away in her sleep. With little options, they decide to drive to Phoenix anyway and deliver her to her son Normy's house (with the dead Aunt Edna tied to the roof of their car). When they reach Normy's home that evening in a raging thunderstorm, they discover he is out of town, and leave Edna's rigor mortised body on a lawn chair in the backyard, over Ellen's objections. Clark concedes to Ellen's request they say a prayer for the dear departed Edna.Despite all the events and the begging of Ellen and the kids, Clark is more determined than ever to get to Walley World. They check into a motel for the night where after another argument with Ellen, Clark hangs out at the motel's bar where he has a face-to-face-encounter with the beautiful young woman from the red Ferrari and they make small talk about things. The woman beckons Clark to go skinny dipping with her in the motel's swimming pool, but upon diving in, Clark screams over his reaction to the cold pool water... thus waking up the entire motel, including Ellen, Rusty, and Audrey. When the woman takes her leave, Clark goes back to apologize to Ellen who demands that Clark repay the favor by taking him back to the pool to skinny dip with her.The next day (Day 7), the family finally arrives in Los Angeles, California and arrives at Wally World... only to find that the park is closed for the next two weeks for repairs. Clark, slipping into madness seeing all the week's struggles had been for nothing, buys a realistic-looking BB gun from a local sporting goods store, returns to Wally World, and demands to a overweight and geekish park security guard named Russ Lasky (John Candy) to take them through the park; Ellen and kids follow him, attempting to placate their father.Eventually a SWAT team arrives along with park owner Roy Walley (Eddie Bracken) and they arrest the whole family. Clark manages to talk to Roy who surprisingly understands Clark's impassioned epitome of the American Vacation, describing his own memory of a less-than-enjoyable cross-country trip he took with his own family to Florida. Roy does not file charges against the Griswolds, and lets the family enjoy the park as his guests, along with the police and SWAT team who are seen riding on the park's top roller coaster attraction in the final shot of the movie.The end credits show various still photographs of the Griswolds enjoying the rest of the vacation at all the various stops they made over the course of the movie, including a final frame of them returning to Chicago via plane... having abandoned their gas-guzzling car in California."
Superman III,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086393/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Synthetic kryptonite laced with tar splits Superman in two: good Clark Kent and bad Man of Steel. Clark travels to Smallville for his High School Reunion and reconnect with his childhood sweetheart Lana Lang. Computer programmer Gus Gorman is hired by financial tycoon Ross, to take control of the coffee business, by wiping out all the competition via satellite. After Superman destroys their plan, Ross makes Gus figure out how to find Kryptonite to eliminate Superman, but he uses tar as the missing element. This causes an unusual effect on Superman. Meanwhile Gus gets his machine he wanted built that can do anything you want it to do.—anielsen-45670 In mortal enemies, the Man of Steel has no match. Even faced with a trio of sinister super-powered villains from his home planet, Superman saved the day. But can super-strength stand up to the diabolical circuitry of a criminally insane computer? Enter Gus Gorman, a genial half-wit who just happens to be a natural-born genius at computer programming. In his hands, a computer keyboard turns into a deadly weapon and soon, Superman faces the microelectronic menace of his career. Clark Kent meets his old flame Lana Lang at a Smallville High School reunion and Superman turns into his own worst enemy after exposure to a chunk of red kryptonite.—Official DVD cover August ""Gus"" Gorman (Richard Pryor) is an unemployed loser looking for a job. In the opening scene, Gus is at a Metropolis employment office to seek out more unemployment insurance and he is told that he is no longer eligible for unemployment benefits because of having been unemployed for 28 weeks. As he lights a cigarette with a borrowed book of matches, he sees an ad for a computer-programming school.While taking his classes, Gus discovers that he has a natural talent for computer programming. He soon finds himself working for a big corporation, Webster Industries. Dissatisfied with the low amount of money he receives for his first week's pay (less than $150 after taxes), he comes up with an idea after a talk with a co-worker about the various half-cent amounts in the company's payroll plan. After hours, Gus creates a program from which he embezzles $85,000 from his new employer's payroll (which is an early computer hacking technique known as salami slicing). Gus is brought to the attention of the CEO, Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) after he shows up to work in a brand new Ferrari. Webster is a megalomaniacal billionaire obsessed with the computer's potential to aid him in his schemes to rule the world financially. Joined by his stuffy sister and right-hand woman Vera (Annie Ross) and his ""psychic nutritionist"" and mistress Lorelei Ambrosia (Pamela Stephenson), Webster blackmails Gus into helping him.Meanwhile, Clark Kent has convinced his newspaper editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper) to allow him a week's vacation to return to Smallville for his 15th high school reunion. Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) however plans to leave on her own vacation to Bermuda. En route with Jimmy Olsen to Smallville, Clark (as Superman), extinguishes a fire in a chemical plant containing vials of acid that can produce clouds of corrosive vapor when super-heated. However, Jimmy is injured with a broken leg while foolishly attempting to get photos of the disaster just as the fire crew realize their water supply is inadequate. To help put out the fire, Superman flies to a nearby lake and freezes the top layer with his super-breath, then carries the frozen sheet of water to the chemical plant where it melts and douses the fire.At the Smallville High Class of 1965 reunion, Clark Kent sees many old classmates, including football star Brad Wilson (Gavan O'Herlihy), his former bully who is now the town drunk and works as a local security guard, and cheerleader Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole), who is now the mother of a ten-year-old boy named Ricky (Paul Kaethler). Clark and Lana dance and quickly fall back into a comfortable ease with each other. Clark confesses that he has not been to Smallville since his mother's funeral, while Lana confides that her husband, Donald White, who was the student council president, left her and Ricky after just three years of marriage. Lana, who works as a secretary, recently had to pawn her engagement ring to pay bills and tells Clark she needs to get out of Smallville. He suggests she come to Metropolis and offers to help her find work.After the reunion, Clark accompanies Lana and her son to the Smallville bowling alley. When young Ricky does poorly at the game, Clark uses a burst of his super-breath to help him score a strike.Meanwhile, Webster schemes to monopolize the world's coffee crop. Infuriated by Colombia's refusal to do business with him, he orders Gus to command an American weather satellite named Vulcan to create a hurricane to decimate the nation's coffee crop. Gus travels to Smallville and in the evening arrives at a Webster Co. subsidiary Wheat King office, (bribing Brad with liquor and waits until he passes out). Gus then carries out his boss's plan. After some funny problems with trying to turn on the computer involving putting both computer keys in at the same time, Gus reprograms the Vulcan weather satellite to cause torrential rains and tornadoes in Colombia.Clark takes Lana and Ricky on a picnic in a wheat field. However, when the boy disappears, Clark spots him unconscious as a harvesting combine approaches. Changing into Superman, he flies to the boy's rescue. When an excited Ricky tells Clark Superman had shown up, Clark brushes it off, saying that in Metropolis, he sees Superman every day. Ricky asks if Clark can get his hero's autograph.Webster's scheme is thwarted when Superman neutralizes the tornado and saves the harvest. Webster then orders Gus to use his computer knowledge to create kryptonite, remembering Lois Lane's Daily Planet interview from Superman years ago (from the first Superman movie), during which Superman identified it as his only weakness. Gus uses a computer to order the Vulcan satellite to locate Krypton's debris in outer space, but after the computer fails to analyze an ""unknown"" element in kryptonite (making up only 1% of the meteor), he improvises by replacing the unidentified element with tar, garnered from a pack of Camel cigarettes that he smokes.Meanwhile, Clark Kent returns to Metropolis to the Daily Planet newspaper write his story about the reunion when Lana telephones saying that Ricky bragged to his friends that Superman was going to be at his birthday party in a week. Clark assures Lana that he and Superman are close friends and he will make sure Superman is there for the party.A week later, Ricky's birthday party is transformed in to a huge ceremony at which the mayor of Smallville gives Superman the key to the city, partly for stopping the chemical plant fire. Gus and Vera, disguised as United States Army officers, show up during the ceremony and give Superman the man-made kryptonite as a gift, and are dismayed to see that it appears to have no effect on him.However, a little later at Lana's house, Superman feels dizzy. Lana receives a call that a tractor-trailer truck has wrecked and the driver is trapped, hanging off a bridge. She urges Superman to go rescue the driver. Superman promises to get to it later, then starts flirting with Lana. She insists he help the driver, snapping him out of his daze. He flies to the scene where the truck has already fallen off a bridge, though the rescue team was able to haul the driver out in time. Superman seems bewildered that he arrived too late. The synthetic Kryptonite had a delayed effect and Superman's personality takes a dark turn. In the following days, he engages in mean-spirited pranks such as blowing out the Olympic flame and straightening Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa. The media covers the Man of Steel's altered behaviors and United Nations votes to censure Superman. 'Bad Superman' also becomes scruffy-looking as his bright blue and red suit becomes transformed into more of a maroon, dark blue color and he doesn't shave.With Superman distracted, Webster furthers his plans by controlling the world's oil supply. Gus moans that Ross gets his own way all of the time and that he feels unappreciated. Webster asks what Gus wants. Gus gives Webster a series of crudely drawn blueprints for a supercomputer, one with advanced defenses designed to find an enemy's greatest vulnerability. Ross makes a deal with Gus, agreeing to build his supercomputer in return for sorting out the oil tankers. Gus sends orders to all of the oil tankers to sail to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and have them sit there until further notice and to command all the oil pumps to stop pumping.However, a British oil tanker does not follow instructions and continues to Metropolis. Lorelei meets the personality-altered Superman on top of the Statue of Liberty in New York City who flirts with her. Before Lorelei will do anything with him, she insists he stop the rogue oil tanker, so he flies to the tanker, punches a hole in its hull and causes a massive oil spill in the ocean.Meanwhile, Lana and Ricky arrive in Metropolis where Superman assuages his depression with a drinking binge. He is eventually overcome by guilt and undergoes a nervous breakdown after Ricky calls out to him, urging him to fight against his descent into evil. After nearly crash-landing in a junkyard, Superman splits into two personas: the evil, selfish, corrupted Superman and the moral, righteous Clark Kent. They engage in an epic battle across the junkyard, with the evil Superman repeatedly trying and failing to kill Clark by crushing him in industrial equipment. (They are both seemingly matched as Superman, despite his powers, becomes more physically weakened after using them, while Clark still has his superhuman strength, but none of Superman's powers of flight or heat vision).Superman finally knocks Clark unconscious and puts him on conveyor belt to be shredded. The battle ends when Clark bursts through the walls of the machine crusher and strangles his evil identity, vanquishing him for good. As a battered but unbowed Clark gazes up at the sky, he pulls his shirt open to reveal his emblem. Restored to his normal heroic self, Superman sets off to repair the damage his evil counterpart had caused. He flies to the oil tanker, blows all the oil back into the tanker with his super-breath and patches the hole with his heat vision.Superman then goes to the apartment penthouse of Webster to confront him only to find a video message that they are hiding out in the Grand Canyon of Arizona... the location where Gus Gorman's supercomputer has been built.After riding on mules to a crest ridge, Webster, Vera, and Lorelei take ""air bikes"" down to the canyon floor, sans Gus who decides to ride down by his own mule. Webster, Vera, and Lorelei arrive at a large cave where the supercomputer is and set out to await Superman's arrival. They activate the computer's system and begin to prepare it's built-in defenses.Superman flies toward the canyon and meets the supercomputer's missiles head on, eventually destroying them all. The last missile is an ""MX"" that stops him temporarily, however, he continues on, finding the cavern where Webster and his crew are hidden. Superman confronts Webster, Vera and Lorelei, and is forced into a battle with Gus Gorman's supercomputer, which severely weakens him with a kryptonite ray. Gus, guilt-ridden and horrified by the prospect of ""going down in history as the man who killed Superman"", destroys the turret projecting the beam with a firefighter's ax, whereupon Superman flees. The living computer becomes self-aware and begins to defend itself against Gus' attempts to disable it, draining power from electrical towers, causing massive blackouts across the North American continent.Ross and Lorelei escape from the control room, but Vera is pulled into the computer and forcibly transformed into a cyborg. Empowered by the supercomputer, Vera attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy. One of them pins Lorelei to the cave's wall, the other acts like a death ray, seemingly to kill Ross himself.Superman returns to the battle with a canister of the Beltric acid from the chemical plant he saved earlier. After battling the living computer which attacks him with bolts of electricity and energy rays, the intense heat emitted by the machine causes the small canister acid to turn volatile, splashing on circuit boards and wires, eventually destroying the supercomputer and saving everyone.Superman flies away with Gus Gorman, leaving Webster and his cronies behind to deal with the authorities. After dropping Gus off at a West Virginia coal mine, where he gives him a job reference (which Gus declines and decides to slip away to re-start his life elsewhere), Superman uses his strength to crush a piece of coal into a large diamond. He returns to Metropolis and after reassuming his Clark Kent identity, reunites with Lana Lang, who has relocated to the big city with her son Ricky and found employment as Perry White's new secretary. At the Daily Planet, Lois Lane returns from a three-week vacation in the Caribbean where she uncovered a corrupt government scheme. Lois meets Lana Lang, who is working for the Planet, for the first time, but becomes jealous learning that the diamond Lana is wearing came from Clark.In the final scene, during a lunch break, Clark (as Superman) flies to Italy to correct one final problem he made as Bad Superman. He pushes the Pisa tower back into its original place... much to the dismay of a local vendor who is now selling straightened Pisa towers."
The Big Chill,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085244/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of seven former college friends gather for a weekend reunion at a South Carolina vacation home after the funeral of another of their college friends. A seminal Thirty-Something movie in which a group of old college friends who are now older and experienced come together for the funeral of Alex, who was at one time the brightest and the best of them at college and yet who never managed to find his way. The friends use the occasion to reacquaint themselves with each other, discuss where their lives have led and speculate on what happened to their idealism which had been abundant when they were younger.—Mark Thompson <mrt@oasis.icl.co.uk> A group of friends who attended the University of Michigan together in the 1960's convene for the funeral of one from their group, Alex, who committed suicide. The group, now in their thirties, have largely kept in touch over the years, but several have drifted somewhat apart as their respective lives changed. Their individual ideals have also changed from their socially conscious and radical days in college, to where they mostly now live comfortable and successful lives. With Alex's much younger and socially naive girlfriend, Chloe, added to the mix, the friends spend the weekend together at married couple Harold and Sarah's vacation house in South Carolina following the funeral. In the light of Alex's unexplained suicide, the friends discuss their lives and collective relationships with each other, then, now and what the future holds.—Huggo In the opening scene, Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline) is bathing his two-year-old son when his wife, Sarah (Glenn Close), receives a phone call at their Richmond, Virgina home telling her that their college friend, Alex Marshall (an uncredited Kevin Costner), has committed suicide by slashing his wrists in the bathtub of their vacation house in South Carolina, where he had been staying.At the funeral, Harold and Sarah are reunited with college friends from their days at the University of Michigan. They include Sam Weber (Tom Berenger), a famous television actor now living in Los Angeles; Meg Jones (Mary Kay Place), an unhappy,single chain-smoking former public defender who is now a real estate attorney living in Atlanta; Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum), a sex-obsessed 'People' magazine journalist living in New York City; Nick Carlton (William Hurt), a Vietnam War veteran and former psychologist radio host living in Chicago who suffers from impotence (due to a Vietnam war injury) and who also struggles with a drug addiction (involving cocaine, Quaalude, and various other painkiller pills); Karen Bowens (JoBeth Williams), a housewife from suburban Detroit who's unhappy in her marriage to her advertising executive husband, Richard Bowens (Don Galloway), an outsider. Also present is Chloe (Meg Tilly), Alex's much-younger girlfriend living with him at the time of his suicide.After the burial, everyone goes from the cemetery to Harold and Sarah's vacation house, where Alex and Chloe had been staying, where Alex committed suicide and where they plan to stay for a reunion over the weekend. When Meg tries to seduce Nick, he responds: ""Did I ever tell you what happened to me in Vietnam?"" During their discussion, a bat flies into the attic where Meg and Nick are and Meg screams. The men are forced to team up to try to remove the bat.Later that night, Sam finds Nick watching television alone in the living room and they briefly talk about Karen and how Sam and Karen were attracted to each other at college. The two then go into the kitchen for a midnight snack and find Richard, her husband, already making a sandwich for himself, and the three of them make small talk which turns into a discussion about responsibility and adulthood. At the end of the discussion, Richard states ""Nobody said it was going to be fun. At least, nobody said it to me.""The next morning, Harold and Nick go jogging. Harold confides in Nick that his business of running shoe company is about to be bought out by a large corporation, and that he and any other shareholders are about to become rich. Harold confides with Nick that Sarah and Alex had an affair five years earlier. Nick comforts Harold by saying, ""She didn't marry Alex.""Richard returns home to look after their kids, but Karen decides to stay in South Carolina for the entire weekend with an obvious interest in Sam. Nick, Harold, Michael and Chloe go for a drive to an old rundown house Alex was renovating while Sam and Karen go food shopping. Back at the house, Meg reveals to Sarah that she wants to have a child, and that she is going to ask Sam to be the father, knowing now that Nick can't. They discuss the group of college male friends as candidates and Harold gets dismissed due to his marriage to Sarah.Out in the countryside, Harold listens to Michael's plans to open a new nightclub in New York and Michael is looking for investors.Chloe is with Nick in the abandoned house that she and Alex were going to renovate. She tells him that he reminds her of Alex, to which Nick replies, ""I ain't him.""During dinner, Sarah starts tearing up over Alex as the group talks about him. Harold puts ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"" by The Temptations on the stereo and everyone dances while cleaning up the dishes. While the others sit around and get high from smoking pot, Meg asks Sam to father her baby, but he declines as he doesn't want the personal responsibility even though there will be no financial responsibility.The next morning, Nick, Sam, and Harold go jogging, and the subject of Alex's suicide comes up again. Harold's surprise arrives: sneakers for everyone to wear during the upcoming Michigan football game. The group, minus Nick, watches the game on TV while Sarah tells Karen about her brief affair with Alex and how it affected their friendship negatively.During the game, Michael offers to father Meg's child, alluding to the fact that they had sex many years ago during the 1963 March on Washington in their college years. At halftime, Chloe, Sam, Harold, and Michael go outside to play touch football. Nick returns, with a police car following him. The officer says that Nick ran a red light and was belligerent, but says that he will drop the charges if Sam would hop into Nick's Porsche as his TV character, J.T. Lancer, always does. Sam is unsuccessful and hurts himself, but the officer drops the charges in deference to Harold who is a local success and icon.Karen later tells Sam that she loves him, wants to leave Richard and live with Sam in Los Angeles with her two sons. When they kiss, Sam pulls away and tells Karen not to leave Richard, as she will regret it in the long run. He confesses that it was ""boredom"" that caused his own marriage to fail, and he doesn't want her to make the same mistake. Karen feels misled and angrily storms into the house.Harold is on the phone with his daughter, Molly, and lets Meg talk to her. Observing their interaction on the phone, Sarah decides to let Harold impregnate Meg.The group once again discusses Alex. Nick says, ""Alex died for most of us a long time ago,"" but Sam disagrees and leaves. Karen follows him and the two have sex outside. Sarah tells Harold about Meg's situation while Chloe and Nick go to bed together, even though he warns her of his condition and that he can'd do anything. Meg and Harold then have sex. Meg says ""I feel like I got a great break on a used car."" In the living room, Michael and Sarah joke around and interview each other with a video camera.In the morning, while Karen is packing her clothes, she subtly makes it clear to Sam that she has decided to stay with Richard. At the breakfast table, Harold reveals that Nick and Chloe will be staying in the guest house for a while so they can renovate the old abandoned house for them to live in. Sam and Nick then make up from their argument the night before. Nick gives Michael an old copy of an article Michael wrote about Alex back in college and him not accepting a prestigious scholarship. At the end of the movie, Michael states, tongue-in-cheek, ""Sarah, Harold. We took a secret vote. We're not leaving. We're never leaving!"" They all laugh and ""Joy to the World"" by Three Dog Night plays as the end credits roll."

But Bond does have an ally though, Largo's girlfriend, the willowy Domino, who falls for Bond.—Official Synopsis In an unidentified tropical region, James Bond, on assignment, is infiltrating an enemy compound. He distracts, subdues and kills several guards until he reaches the compound's primary building. After eliminating several more guards, he enters an adjacent bedroom where he finds a kidnapped woman, bound to a bed. As he frees her arms, she grabs a hidden knife and stabs him in the ribs.At MI6 headquarters, Bond's boss, M, and a tactician review Bond's performance on video; the mission was a fake assignment designed to test Bond's effectiveness. Though his total mission time was acceptable, Bond is heavily criticized for being killed, a result of him missing details in the mission's ""plot"".

Blush's role will be as Capt. Petachi's caretaker following the surgery. However, SPECTRE has also ensured his compliance by addicting him to heroin and threatening the life of Domino.At Shrublands, Bond is required to adhere to a strict regimen of controlled diet and exercise. However, it does not prevent him from sneaking in a small cache of rich food, which he uses while he seduces his physical therapist. After the two have had sex in Bond's room, Bond notices a commotion across the courtyard in another room; a woman is arguing with a man whom she then beats severely. The two are Petachi and Blush. Bond sneaks over to the man's window and observes him using a strange decoding machine. The window shade suddenly flies open and Petachi sees Bond. Blush searches the nearby grounds for Bond using night-vision glasses and spots him easily.The next day Bond is working out in the club's weight room when he is attacked by a large thug, Lippe. Their battle spills into several rooms of the club, causing much destruction. Lippe finally corners Bond in a small lab and Bond throws the contents of a nearby beaker in the man's face, causing him to scream horribly and back into a set of shelves, impaling himself on dozens of pieces of glassware. The man falls dead and Bond looks at the beaker's label; it reads ""James Bond - urine specimen"". Bond later reports to M who chastises him harshly for creating an enormous amount of damage to the club. Bond humorously informs M that he did lose some weight and ""free radicals"", prompting a furious outburst from his boss.At an American-run air force base in Britain, Jack Petachi steals into a sealed control room and uses his fake eye and decoding machine to successfully switch two ""dummy"" warheads for live nuclear ones. The warheads are installed into two cruise missiles which are loaded on a plane for a test mission. Shortly after leaving the base, Petachi is killed by Blush, who causes a car crash and finishes him with an explosive device.The warheads are launched from a British stealth bomber and speed toward their intended targets. As they pass by Max Largo's yacht, the Flying Saucer (""Disco Volante"" in Thunderball), one of Largo's operatives activates a jamming device which forces the missiles to splash down. They are taken aboard and later hidden in an underwater cave. A broadcast from SPECTRE informs NATO that the missiles will likely have differing targets. SPECTRE naturally demands an exorbitant amount of money as ransom. On the yacht, Largo surprises Domino during a dancing lesson, acting slightly neurotic about the slightly sexual nature of the moves her instructor is teaching. He gives her the priceless Tears of Allah pendant and tells her that if she ever loses it or she leaves him, he'll kill her.Bond speaks with M and decides to check a lead; Petachi was logged leaving the base right before he was killed. Bond has discovered that Petachi's sister, Domino, is involved with Largo himself and tracks them both to Nassau in the Bahamas. Before leaving, Bond visits the armory and a jovial Q gives him a fountain pen that fires explosive charges, a watch containing a powerful laser and tells him he'll be sending Bond a hi-tech motorcycle while he's on his mission.Bond is met in Nassau by the bumbling Nigel Small-Fawcett, his MI6 contact. Small-Fawcett informs Bond that Largo possesses no criminal record and is quite a philanthropist. Bond is met at a beach-side bar by Fatima Blush, who persuades Bond to join her on a deep-sea diving expedition. The two have sex on the way to their dive spot and explore the wreck of a sunken ship. Blush discretely places a small tracking device on Bond's scuba tank that attracts a tiger shark. Bond traps it on the wreck, only to find another tiger has taken its place. Bond finds the tracking device and detaches it, however, his oxygen line is cut. He swims to the surface and finds a woman he'd befriended at the Nassau harbor. When Fatima sees him and the woman at the dock later on, she is spurned and plants an explosive charge under Bond's bed. She activates it only to find she'd gotten the wrong room; Bond had gone back to the fishing woman's room instead.Bond checks in with Small-Fawcett, who tells Bond that Largo has set sail for the south of France on the Flying Saucer. Bond travels there and meets his MI6 contact, Nicole, and Felix Leiter, his CIA contact. While Bond observes the Flying Saucer in the bay below their villa, he sees Domino dancing on the deck. Bond goes to the same spa as Domino and poses as a masseur to find out information about Largo. Domino tells him that Largo is hosting a large charity event that night for orphaned children. Bond goes there and gains entry by subduing a security guard. He meets Domino and Largo; the millionaire challenges Bond to a video game called Domination. The two battle each other for monetary values attached to countries of the world. The game, however, is rigged to electrically shock the hands of the loser in each round. In the final round, Bond, having endured severe shocks while losing, challenges Largo to a match for the entire dollar amount of the remainder of the world, wins and forces Largo to let go of his hand controls; when Largo shows no obvious physical pain, Bond concludes that Largo is psychotic. Largo is about to pay Bond his winnings when Bond offers to waive them in exchange for a single dance with Domino. Largo orders a tango and during the dance, Bond slyly tells Domino that Jack is dead and that her lover is the chief suspect. Largo suddenly ends the dance and tells Domino that her brother will again be delayed in meeting them.Bond returns to the villa to find Nicole murdered and hears the killer leaving the house. The killer is Fatima, who drives off. Bond mounts the turbo motorcycle sent to him by Q and pursues her in a furious chase, using the cycle's defenses to evade the henchmen who chase him in cars. He pursues her into a harbor-side warehouse, where she knocks him from his cycle. At gunpoint, threatening to shoot him in the crotch, she forces him to write a statement saying that Fatima was the greatest sexual partner he's ever encountered. Bond tries shooting her with an explosive charge from his pen but the charge fails to detonate immediately. As Fatima aims her own gun, the charge goes off, killing her. Felix Leiter steps out from a hiding place and helps Bond escape the French police.Before the Flying Saucer sets sail, Bond and Leiter scuba dive to its keel, finding that it's designed to open, which it does. Bond is quickly captured and is treated quite pleasantly as a guest by the genial Largo. Bond finds Domino in the yacht's dancing studio and deliberately kisses her passionately, knowing Largo is watching through a one-way mirror in his private control room. Largo rushes into the studio and begins smashing the mirrors and stereo with a fire ax. The distraction works and Bond gains entry to Largo's control room, radioing his contacts that the Flying Saucer is headed for North Africa.After arriving in North Africa, Largo retrieves the hidden nuclear warheads and imprisons Bond in an ancient fortress. He explains to Bond that the two nukes have different targets; one will be planted in Washington DC, but he refuses to reveal the other target specifically, which will be somewhere in the oil fields of the Middle East. He also gives Domino to a man who intends to auction her off to a group of local Arab men. Bond waits until Largo leaves and escapes from his shackles with the laser hidden in his watch. He steals a horse from a guard and rescues Domino, however, the two are forced to jump from a rampart into the sea to escape. They are rescued by Leiter, who has come in an American submarine.The submarine follows the Flying Saucer, finding her anchored off a shallow coastline. Bond, Leiter and the sub's captain try to figure out where Largo has hidden the bombs. The location is revealed when Bond notices that the map of the general area matches the design on Domino's pendant, The Tears of Allah, which refers to an underground pool of blue water. Bond and Leiter, along with a commando team, infiltrate Largo's lair and battle briefly with his men but are unable to stop him from moving the bomb to his yacht. Bond and Leiter regroup with the sub's crew and pursue the Flying Saucer. Bond is dropped from a helicopter into the crevasse where Largo intends to plant the warhead. He fights with Largo, pinning him to the crevasse wall with a submersible vehicle and disarms the bomb. Largo aims a harpoon gun at Bond but is killed himself by Domino, who uses a harpoon gun of her own. She and Bond return to the surface.While on holiday with Domino, Bond surprises a man who had attempted to sneak up on him. The man is Nigel Small-Fawcett who informs Bond that M wants him to return to active service. Bond refuses, saying ""never"" - a reference to actor Sean Connery's quitting the role of James Bond after his final film, Diamonds are Forever. Bond and Domino share a kiss as the final titles roll."
Scarface,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel and succumbs to greed. Tony Montana manages to leave Cuba during the Mariel exodus of 1980. He finds himself in a Florida refugee camp but his friend Manny has a way out for them: undertake a contract killing and arrangements will be made to get a green card. He's soon working for drug dealer Frank Lopez and shows his mettle when a deal with Colombian drug dealers goes bad. He also brings a new level of violence to Miami. Tony is protective of his younger sister but his mother knows what he does for a living and disowns him. Tony is impatient and wants it all however, including Frank's empire and his mistress Elvira Hancock. Once at the top however, Tony's outrageous actions make him a target and everything comes crumbling down.—garykmcd Starving for a hearty slice of the exciting American Dream, the Cuban refugee and ex-convict, Tony ""Scarface"" Montana, winds up in the sun-drenched boulevards of PresidentJimmy Carter's Miami, afterFidel Castro's massive expulsion of Marielitos. There, a blood-soaked drug deal will pave the way for Tony's meteoric rise in the city's violent but lucrative cocaine scene, rapidly transforming him from a voracious dreamer into an all-powerful mega-drug lord. Now, anyone who dares to stand in the way of the cocaine king gets a lethal response from his blood-thirsty Colt AR-15. Will Tony's cocaine-fuelled paranoia mark the beginning of his downfall?—Nick Riganas After getting a green card in exchange for assassinating a Cuban government official, Tony Montana (Pacino) stakes a claim on the drug trade in Miami. Viciously murdering anyone who stands in his way, Tony eventually becomes the biggest drug lord in the state, controlling nearly all the cocaine that comes through Miami. But increased pressure from the police, wars with Colombian drug cartels and his own drug-fuelled paranoia serve to fuel the flames of his eventual downfall. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana. Tony and his friend Manny arrive in the United States and start in small time jobs. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez to pay money to a group of Colombians. When the deal goes wrong, Tony and Manny leave with the money and succeed in their job. Soon Tony meets with drug kingpin Frank Lopez and falls for his boss's girl, Elvira. Pretty soon Tony will know that those who want it all, do not last forever; that is the price of power.—Emphinix In May 1980, a Cuban man named Tony Montana (Al Pacino) claims asylum, in Florida, USA, and is in search of the ""American Dream"" after departing Cuba in the Mariel boat-lift of 1980. When questioned by three tough-talking INS officials, they notice a tattoo on Tony's left hand of a black heart with a pitchfork through it, which identifies him as a hit-man, and detain him in a camp called 'Freedomtown' with other Cubans, including Tony's best friend and former Cuban Army buddy Manolo ""Manny Ray"" Ribiera (Steven Bauer), under the local I-95 expressway while the government evaluates their visa petitions.After 30 days of governmental dithering and camp rumors, Manny receives an offer from the Cuban Mafia which he quickly relays to Tony. If they kill Emilio Rebenga (Roberto Contreras) a former aide to Fidel Castro who is now detained in Freedomtown, they will receive green cards. Tony agrees, and kills Rebenga during a riot at Freedomtown. The murder of Rebenga was requested by Frank López, a wealthy, politically astute man who deals cars and trades in cocaine, as Rebenga had tortured López's brother to death while still in Cuba many years earlier.After getting their Green Cards, Tony Montana and Manny Ray find work as dishwashers in a corner sandwich/taco shop. Some weeks later, a López henchman and under-boss, Omar Suárez (F. Murray Abraham), the man who contacted Manny for the Rebenga hit job, offers Tony and Manny a low-risk job of unloading marijuana from a boat from Mexico to arrive in Miami the following night for $500 each. Tony insults Suárez by turning down the job over the little money they will receive, and demands at least $1,000 for the work. After an altercation, Suárez sets Tony up on another job to purchase two kilograms of cocaine worth around $25,000 a piece from a Colombian dealer, named Hector The Toad, a medium to high-risk job for which Tony and Manny will receive $5,000 for their work.That weekend, Tony, Manny, and two other Marielitos in his crew whom they met in Freedomtown, Angel Fernández (Pepe Serna), and Chi Chi (Ángel Salazar) then set out to meet ""Hector the Toad"" (Al Israel) at a seedy motel on the boulevard in Miami Beach. While Manny and Chi Chi wait in the car on the street, Tony and Angel go up to the hotel room to meet with Hector. The meeting does not go smoothly, as Tony grows irritated with Hector, who is slow to give him the cocaine in exchange for money. Suddenly, Tony and Angel are double-crossed by the Colombian. It becomes apparent that Hector does not intend to sell Tony the cocaine he has; he only wants to steal the money Tony has been given to purchase the product. To convince Tony to give over the cash, Hector dismembers Angel in a shower stall with a chainsaw. After Angel is dead, Tony, about to suffer the same fate, is saved by Chi Chi and Manny who arrive in the nick of time to gun down Hector's henchmen. Manny receives a minor bullet wound in his shoulder when his Uzi sub-machine gun jams. Hector escapes but Tony vengefully confronts him in the street and shoots him dead in the middle of the crowded Ocean Drive (the now famous Miami South Beach boulevard). Tony and his crew then get away with both the cocaine and the money before the police arrive.The following night, Tony and Manny meet Frank López (Robert Loggia) at his house for the first time where Tony impresses Lopez with not only the return of his cash but with a gift of the cocaine, a prize from the botched rip off. Frank immediately hires Tony and his crew into his criminal hierarchy, a representative of a Cuban mafia. But during this initial get together Tony also meets Lopez's lady, the blond and beautiful Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer), who will eventually become the source of tension between the two men. Taking Tony and Manny out to a local nightclub, called The Babylon Club where Frank frequently attends, Tony and Manny see first-hand the high standard of living they have come to acquire. Though Frank actually warns against these excesses, Tony is seduced by them regardless. Thus, Tony Montana begins his rise through the ranks of the Miami cocaine underworld.After three months, Tony has advanced in the ranks in Frank's cartel from drug runner and purchaser to a trusted lieutenant along with Manny. They work low-risk jobs such as being Frank's bodyguards and messengers. Tony continues to grow more attracted to Elvira as he helps her purchase a new Cadillac vehicle for herself and casually flirts with her privately. Elvira enjoys the attention but still seems to think of Tony as a low-level hood.Tony attempts to make amends by meeting with his estranged family. It is implied that Tony's father, a former U.S. Navy sailor, abandoned the family when Tony was little. Since then, his mother (Miriam Colon) and younger 19-year-old sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) have been living in Miami. Tony shows up at his mother's and Gina's house one evening, fashionably dressed, and offers them $1,000 in cash for financial support. Gina is overjoyed to see her older brother whom they have not seen for five years. However, Tony's mother has only scorn for him since he turned his back on them many years ago for the quick and easy life of crime back in Cuba, and wants nothing to do with him. She is too full of pride to accept his money despite being financially stricken. But Gina, who idolizes her brother, follows him outside where he slips her the money secretly. Gina tells Tony that she wants in on the flashy life that he has going for him. Tony's love for Gina is clearly genuine for she's the only person that he trusts, and is also obsessively protective of her. Afterward, Manny (who waited in the car that he and Tony arrived in) makes a comment to Tony about how attractive Gina is, but Tony angrily warns him to stay away from her.Several months later, Tony is sent to Bolivia to help Omar set up a new distribution deal with Bolivian kingpin Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) for the purchase of 200 kilograms of cocaine, since Frank is having legal troubles that preclude him from leaving the country. Though Tony was supposed to let Omar do all the talking, Omar proves to be a poor negotiator, prompting Tony to step in and save the deal. They seem to negotiate a deal that, on the surface seems favorable to both sides, with Sosa overseeing the transportation to Panama and to let Tony and the Lopez cartel take over from there, but Omar insists that Frank would not approve. Sosa seemingly sides with Omar and suggests that Omar use his phone to call Frank. A few minutes later, Sosa hands Tony binoculars, and he sees two menacing assassins, Alberto the Shadow (Mark Margolis) and the Skull (Geno Silva), execute Omar by hanging him by the neck from an airborne helicopter. Sosa reveals that Alberto recognized Omar as once being an informant for the police several years ago when he worked in New York City... and Sosa has a zero tolerance for disloyalty. Tony insists that he never goes back on his word, and that he never trusted Omar. Believing that Tony is trustworthy, Sosa agrees to bring Tony on board with him as his North American distributor of cocaine and other drugs. But upon their agreement, Sosa sternly warns Tony never to betray or double-cross him in any way.Upon his return to Florida, Tony is verbally chewed out by Frank for overstepping his authority as well as hearing about Omar's death. Tony explains to Frank that for a price of $18 million to pay Sosa for the manufacturing and transportation costs, they will receive 2,000 kilograms of cocaine from Bolivia for nationwide sale and distribution which will earn them $75 million over a period of one year. Frank is worried because he does not have the many millions to pay Sosa for the cocaine, but Tony says that he is in tight with Sosa and he has established a ""credit line"" with him as well as work out a payment plan where they will pay Sosa $5 million up front and the rest in monthly installments. Plus, in case Frank comes up short a few million, Tony will earn the money needed through his own street contacts. Frank angrily tells Tony that he did not negotiate a good deal and that Sosa merely tricked him into thinking he did. Tony replies that it's time for them to ""think big,"" and to expand the cartel for nationwide distribution of cocaine. With them as the main North American distributors and wholesalers of the Sosa cartel, they will make millions and become the biggest cartel in the continent. Frank warns Tony that Sosa cannot be trusted and that he will sooner or later turn against them for any slight deviation or compromise of his business. Frank orders Tony to stall his deal with Sosa for the time being. Frank then promptly tells Tony that ambitious drug dealers, such at himself, who want too much and crave money, power and attention, do not last long in the business. Tony leaves shrugging with indifference and strikes out on his own.After this incident, Tony then seeks out Elvira to whom he makes an unexpected marriage proposal. She is shaken but agrees to think about it. Frank López is none too happy when he hears about it and decides to take out Tony.At the Babylon nightclub that evening, Tony is approached and shaken down by a Miami police detective, named Mel Bernstein (Harris Yulin). He proposes to ""tax"" Tony on his transactions in return for police protection and information. Tony is distracted by the sight of Gina dancing with a local drug dealer. He follows the two to a restroom stall where he berates Gina for her promiscuous conduct. He asks Manny to take her home. On the way Gina admits she is attracted to Manny. Manny wards her off, mindful of Tony's obsessive protection of her.Back at the nightclub, Tony is attacked by two gunmen but manages to escape, killing them both despite being wounded by a gunshot to his left shoulder. Suspecting Frank sent Bernstein and the hit-men, Tony asks one of his bodyguards, Nick The Pig (Michael P. Moran), to call Frank after Tony arrives at Frank's office at 3:00 a.m. that very night and inform him the hit failed. Tony, Manny and Chi Chi visit Frank at his car dealership back office, who is with Det. Bernstein. Nick calls Frank, who confirms his involvement by playing the call off as Elvira telling him she'll be late home. When it becomes apparent that Bernstein (who is armed) will not help him, Frank begs for Tony's forgiveness, saying that he can have Elvira and ten million dollars in exchange for sparing his life. Tony will have none of it, and Manny coldly executes Frank. Bernstein insists that he could be a valuable ally for Tony, but Tony disagrees, and kills him too. Tony, Manny and Chi Chi then look upon the late Frank's personal bodyguard Ernie (Arnaldo Santana) and offer him a choice of being killed or work for them. Ernie naturally agrees to work for Tony.His problems apparently solved, Tony begins a profitable relationship with Sosa over the next year and-a-half. Tony marries Elvira, buys a huge mansion complete with surveillance cameras and numerous luxury items, and Tony even sets Gina up in business with her own beauty salon complete with a paid staff. Manny and Gina soon begin a romantic relationship, but they keep it secret from Tony who had firmly stated to Gina that he does not want her dating anybody (at least not anyone in the drug dealing business).As Tony's business grows, so does his cocaine addiction and paranoia, and he begins to spiral out of control... the beginning of the end. His wife, who becomes further addicted to cocaine, becomes bored and emotionally distant. Tony's banker Gerry (Dennis Holahan) informs him that laundering the increasing flow of drug money has become increasingly difficult, so he will be charging higher fees, up to 10%. A Jewish mob boss, named Mel Seidelbaum (Ted Beniades), contacts Manny, offering his assistance. However, as they are cleaning out the money, Seidelbaum reveals himself to be an undercover cop and arrests Tony along with Chi Chi. After posting a $5 million in bail, Tony's corrupt lawyer, George Sheffield (Michael Alldredge), tells him that although he may get him cleared of the corruption and money laundering charges, Tony will probably have to serve at least three years in prison for income tax evasion. Manny suggests that he take it, as the American prison system is nowhere near as harsh as its Cuban counterpart, and the right legal loopholes could trim the sentence down to six months. However, the strung-out Tony yells that he would rather die than spend a single day in jail.After hearing about Tony's arrest, Sosa, not wanting to lose his main distributor, offers Tony a way out of going to prison. He calls Tony back to Bolivia where he introduces him to his cocaine ""board of directors"" a group that includes a sugar land baron, Bolivia's military chief, and a mysterious American named Charles Goodson (Gregg Henry). We assume he is a corrupt CIA officer because Sosa guarantees that the IRS will not be able to send Tony to jail. But this help comes at a price. A Bolivian journalist is attempting to expose the ongoing corruption in the Bolivian government involvement in drug trafficking, and his crusade is beginning to hurt Sosa and his partners. Sosa will be sending Alberto to New York assassinate the journalist, but he needs Tony and his crew to provide some extra muscle. Tony is clearly disturbed by the assassination since it is against his custom to kill a man whom he sees as a civilian, plus Tony has never killed anybody who didn't wrong him personally. But seeing no other options, Tony reluctantly agrees to help Sosa with the hit.In the meantime, Tony's marriage with Elvira finally ends when after a bitter altercation at a local restaurant, she finally expresses her contempt for him and the lives he had led her on, and walks out of the restaurant, and out of his life. Tony, punch-drunk on cocaine, tells the restaurant's other patrons that his existence is necessary since society needs a man like him to call a criminal. Tony also informs Manny to look after things while he travels to New York on business (but he doesn't tell him anything about the Sosa assassination deal.)Tony, with his two trusted henchmen, Chi Chi and Ernie, along with Alberto travel to New York City and Alberto places a bomb under the journalist's car in with the intention of detonating it outside the UN building before the the man addresses the General Assembly and exposes Sosa's cartel. But Tony has second thoughts when the journalist unexpectedly picks up his wife and children. Tony, saying that the team was only supposed to kill only the journalist, shoots Alberto to prevent the journalist's family from being killed. When authorities later discover the unexploded bomb underneath the journalist's car, they realize that an execution had been planned and increase the amount of security protecting the journalist. Sosa is now the primary suspect and Sosa vows to get even with Tony.Returning to Miami, Tony discovers that Gina and Manny (who opposed the trip to New York) have disappeared. Tony visits his mother again where she angrily tells him about Gina's descent into an immoral life and accuses him of corrupting her with his flashy lifestyle. After getting Gina's home address from Mrs. Montana, Tony goes to the house in nearby Palm Grove. Much to Tony's surprise, Manny unexpectedly opens the door in his bathrobe. Tony then sees Gina in a night gown at the top of the stairs. Enraged that another man has obviously slept with his sister, Tony shoots Manny dead. Hysterical, Gina reveals to Tony that they had just been married and were going to surprise him. Tony, riddled with guilt, has Gina taken back to his mansion.In revenge for Tony's failure to kill the journalist, who has now exposed Sosa and his partners to the world as drug lords, Sosa sends a Latino mercenary hit squad (the size of a large platoon), to Tony's mansion to kill him that evening. Sitting at his desk snorting from an enormous pile of cocaine, Tony realizes and regrets what he has done to his best friend. He takes a call from Sosa and berates him, telling him he's prepared for whatever Sosa can throw at him. When Tony is contemplating his actions, Sosa's mercenaries breach the main gate at Tony's estate and quietly begin to kill all the guards around the mansion. At the same time, a distraught Gina, wearing only an unbuttoned sleep shirt and armed with a revolver, enters Tony's office to confront him with the truth about his feelings for her. She now realizes that Tony loves her in an unnatural way and demands, at gunpoint, that he make love to her. She begins to shoot at him while demanding he take her. A Sosa assassin hiding on the balcony, thinking Gina is shooting at him, leaps in and riddles her with bullets. An enraged Tony throws the man off the balcony and kills him with his sub-machine gun creating a storm of chaos at the mansion. At this point, the mercenaries, robbed of the element of surprise by the gunshots, swarm in to attack Tony's mansion from all directions.As all his men are being killed, including Ernie and Nick the Pig, Tony, still delirious from the cocaine, leans over Gina's dead body begging for forgiveness, at the same time the mercs break into the mansion. Chi Chi opens fire with an Uzi as he falls back and ends up banging on the door to Tony's office (it has been locked from the inside by Gina who was planning to kill Tony). Unfortunately, Tony does not seem to hear him. Chi Chi is shot in the back and Tony sees it on the security cameras.As the hit men prepare to storm into his office, Tony finally snaps out of his drug-induced state, arms himself with an M16A1 assault rifle with an under-mounted M203 grenade launcher and blows down the door. A huge climatic gun battle begins as Tony takes position atop the grand staircase and guns down dozens of Sosa's men who try to storm the balcony. Tony is hit a number of times by return fire, but he keeps shooting. With most of Sosa's men dead, Tony, strung-out on drugs, defiantly yells out at the assassins, not realizing that the Skull has sneaked into the room behind him. The Skull shoots Tony in the back with a 12-Gauge shotgun. Tony falls off the balcony and into a reflecting pool at the base of the grand staircase. In the final shot, as the Skull and the few surviving assassins look on, Tony Montana lies dead... face down in the bloody reflecting pool which is located below a large brass globe that says: THE WORLD IS YOURS."
Jaws 3-D,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085750/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A giant thirty-five-foot shark becomes trapped in a SeaWorld theme park and it's up to the sons of police chief Brody to rescue everyone. Several years after Brody electrocuted the shark at Cable Junction, his sons, Mike and Sean, are now working in different roles at Sea World Orlando. Mike is working as a park engineer and considering marriage to his girlfriend, killer whale biologist Kathryn Morgan. Sean is also involved with 1 of the park's water skiers, Kelly Ann Bukowski. Sea World is about to open a massive 'Undersea Kingdom' which will bring visitors closer to marine life than ever before. The park is accessible from the ocean by a series of gates, one of which malfunctions. A young Great White Shark swims through the gate, and when a maintenance diver heads down to fix the gate he does not return. The young Great White is captured and placed in a tank but soon dies despite Kathryn's best efforts to save it. More alarming though, is the young shark's massive, 35 foot mother which has followed the baby shark into the lagoon and killed the maintenance diver, whose body is recovered. It isn't long before the huge shark begins wreaking havoc, and Mike and Kathryn, along with Sea World manager Calvin Bouchard and photographer Phillip Fitzroyce, must find a way to eliminate the shark before they - or the guests - become the shark's next meal.—Medic249a2 With the grand opening of Florida's fantastic Sea World theme park just around the corner, a sophisticated attraction of Plexiglas tunnels and in-your-face underwater action, Amity's former Police Chief Martin Brody's sons, Michael and Sean, already have a lot on their plate. But, before long, after the recent massacre inJaws 2 (1978), a stranded baby great white shark infiltrates the intricate system, and unsuspecting water-skiers and busy park employees become its first meal. Now, its mother, too, a swift, massive, 35-foot-long killing machine of razor-sharp teeth, is trapped in this all-you-can-eat buffet, and no one is safe. Is there an escape from the blood-stained Undersea Kingdom, and the jaws of the great white shark?—Nick Riganas This third film in the series follows a group of marine biologists attempting to capture a young great white shark that has wandered into Florida's Sea World Park. However, later it is discovered that the shark's 35-foot mother is also a guest at Sea World. What follows is the shark wreaking havoc on the visitors in the park.—Andrew Schaeffer Chief Martin Brody's older son, Michael (Dennis Quaid) now works for SeaWorld in Florida, which is preparing for the launch of its new ""Undersea Kingdom,"" a set of tunnels where people can ""view the wonders of the deep without ever getting wet."" The film opens with a great white shark following a team of waterskiers, among them Kelly (Lea Thompson). Their boat stalls, but then its driver gets it going again before anyone is attacked.Michael Brody is the chief engineer, and lives with his girlfriend, Katherine Morgan (Bess Armstrong), who is senior biologist at the park. Katherine and her assistants, Dan and Liz, wonder why the dolphins are afraid to leave their pen. As Sean (John Putch), Michael's brother, arrives to visit, he reveals a deep fear of the water (from events depicted in Jaws 2). Kelly, after meeting Michael, Sean, and Katherine in a bar, tries to dispel the phobia by playing in the water (mostly) naked at nighttime.Meanwhile, Shelby Overman (Harry Grant), one of the mechanics, dives into the water at dusk to repair the gates. He is attacked by a shark and killed, only leaving a severed arm. The next morning, Michael and Katherine are informed of his disappearance by Charlene, a woman with whom Overman is living. She is quite irate at his failure to return, and fears the worst.Michael and Katherine go down in a submarine to check the tunnels and find Overman's severed arm. They decide to go into a piece of scenery, the Spanish galleon, although encouraged by Katherine's two dolphins to stay away. They continue the search, leaving the submarine, only to be assaulted by a great white. The dolphins, having sensed trouble from the start and visibly beseeching Katherine to stay in the sub, respond to Katherine's waving hands. They heroically rescue Mike and Katherine by allowing them to ride them back to the safety of their dolphin pen.This information is at first disbelieved by park owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett, Jr.) , but is quite exciting to his friend, the hunter Phillip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale). Katherine protests FitzRoyce's intent to kill the creature, so capturing it is the decided course. The baby great white is captured and nursed to partial health by Katherine and Liz. Before the shark can be put on display in the park, it must regain its strength -- Michael and Katherine keep it in a small holding pool. However, Calvin orders it exhibited as being the first Great White in captivity, but it dies within minutes.Meanwhile, Kelly persuades Sean to join her on the bumper boats. While walking through of on the underwater tunnels, a girl is terrified when she sees a hideous corpse, revealed to be Overman, bob up to a window. Katherine reveals that the bites came from a shark with a mouth a yard across, which is initially ridiculed by FitzRoyce, saying ""That would indicate a shark of some 35 ft. in length"", which is too big for a normal great white. They surmise that the shark's mother has also breached the gates of the park, but she can't convince Calvin of this fact. The mother white is actually trapped in the intake tube of the park's water pump but escapes when it forces the gate open. The mother shark shows up at the window of their underwater cafe. The shark exacts her revenge, first by causing a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel, then turns her attention to everyone on the beach. She fails to capture the waterskiers, but capsizes Sean and Kelly's bumper boat, and Kelly gets a laceration from the shark's coarse skin.FitzRoyce leads the shark into the filtration pipes where the water from the ocean is brought into the lagoon, hoping to trap her inside. However, he drifts right into her mouth after his lifeline rope snaps. He prepares a grenade, but he is crushed to death before he can use it.Unaware of FitzRoyce's death, Michael has gone down to repair the underwater tunnel so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water, with Katherine watching his back. He welds the repair piece, but, with no pressure in the pipe to restrain her, the shark breaks free of the filtration pipe and attacks Katherine again, but is protected by her dolphins. They return to the control room with Calvin and the technicians. The shark smashes through the acrylic glass, flooding the room. As everyone tries to escape, Mike notices FitzRoyce's body still inside the shark's mouth, clutching the grenade. Mike uses a pole to pull the grenade's pin, and it explodes, blowing the shark to pieces.Katherine and Mike float up to the surface, explaining that Calvin managed to rescue the female technician, though the shark attacked the male technician and dropped him. Katherine is terrified for her dolphins, until they triumphantly show up in a splash, performing the tricks they refused to do since the movie's beginning."
Blue Thunder,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085255/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The cop test pilot for an experimental police helicopter learns the sinister implications of the new vehicle. Blue Thunder is a specially modified helicopter. It is for police work, but is armed and designed to counter street insurgencies. Its makers want to show what it will do, but have to train Los Angeles Police pilot Frank Murphy to fly and use it in order to allow it to operate in the city. Murphy and the project pilot have differences going back to Vietnam. The conflict between them continues to heat up as Murphy begins to suspect that Blue Thunder is more than has been disclosed.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Frank Murphy, of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Police's helicopter division (ASTRO), and newcomer Richard Lymangood on his first patrol, help take down the perpetrators of what appears to be a robbery and attempted rape of a city councilwoman. They are little aware of the much larger and more sinister plot behind the attack, much less that they will soon find themselves right in the middle of it. Murphy (Roy Scheider) and Lymangood (Daniel Stern) then learn that they have been selected to test a new, state-of-the-art, high-performance helicopter with cutting-edge surveillance capabilities--Blue Thunder. Disconcertingly, unlike other police aircraft, Blue Thunder is also equipped with powerful weaponry. When Murphy is introduced to the lead pilot for the program he finds that it is an old nemesis from his tours in Vietnam, Col. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), who is none too pleased to learn who has been selected for the test. Soon Murphy and Lymangood, via the helicopter's information system, discover disquieting hints that there may be much bigger and less honorable plans for the 'copter than they've been told, leading them to defy orders and seek more information on their own. It is now up to them, with the help of Murphy's spirited wife, Kate, to blow the lid off the plot and expose the villainy within.—R. Simard In the Metropolitan Police Astro Division of Los Angeles, which controls all police helicopters, the night shift is about to begin. After checking off the list, Captain Braddock (Warren Oates) is looking for the senior pilot Frank Murphy (Roy Schneider). He orders the rookie observer Lymangood (Daniel Stern) to find Murphy. Lymangood finds Murphy in the ready room, playing with his digital wristwatch. In a few seconds, Murphy goes to talk to Braddock, only to find that his regular observer, Montoya, has been transferred to day shift. Instead, he gets the rookie Lymangood.The pair takes off in one of the helicopters, and Murphy is able to spot things on the ground, pointing out things even before the rookie can even get his binoculars on it. They respond to a store robbery call, shine the ""midnight sun"" searchlight onto one of the perps, and get shot at for their effort. However, a squad car arrives and officers quickly bring the suspect down. As the helicopter circles overhead, Murphy and Lymangood spot someone creeping up on the officers. They try to give directions, but it's too dark, and Murphy takes the helicopter down, only 10 feet off the ground, and ""dust"" the suspect, drowning him in dust, which gives the officers enough time to subdue the other suspect.Later that night, they spot an apparently abandoned vehicle, no plates, in the Brentwood neighborhood, pretty upscale. They call it in, and Murphy decides to show Lymangood something interesting. They fly over to nearby Encino, which is outside their patrol area. At 9:30PM, Lymangood is able to observe a very flexible young woman doing some amazing yoga moves in the nude. Unfortunately, they are interrupted. That ""abandoned car"" they spotted earlier was not abandoned. The character inside watches as a black woman drives her Lincoln by, opens her gate, and enters. He quickly follows and places a brick to block the gate so it can't close, and another car roars into the courtyard, smashing into the back of the black woman's car. Then two men emerge from the car and rush forward, one yelling ""get the briefcase!"" as the other tries to subdue the black woman.The patrol cars arrive on the scene just as the suspects try to escape, and run back into the yard, and Murphy's air unit arrives overhead, as they observe the ensuing gun battle. The two suspects only have light revolvers, while police are armed with revolvers and shotguns. One suspect is hit and falls face down into the swimming pool. The other tries to climb the fence with the briefcase, but he is spotlighted by the helicopter and police hit him twice. The briefcase falls and splits open, papers fly everywhere in the helicopter's downwash. The black woman is pleading, ""Just let them go! Please!"" as she staggers toward the gunfight. The suspect on the fence returns fire at the police, hitting the black woman instead in the neck. Then three policemen fire, hitting the suspect multiple times, who falls from the fence.Murphy, watching from above, suddenly has a Vietnam flashback, about being a pilot in a U.S. Army helicopter and about a man in North Vietnamese Army uniform falling after being pushed out of the helicopter by an unseen U.S. serviceman... and the helicopter loses several hundred feet in altitude before he regains control.A little later, Murphy's unit lands back at the base, and is summoned for a session with an angry Captain Braddock, who grounds both Murphy and Lymangood for that ""stunt"" over Encino, practically hovering right off someone's balcony, instead of patrolling over their assigned area, and may have prevented the assault on City Councilwoman McNealy (the black woman previously shot). McNealy is now in critical condition in hospital. McNealy had always criticized police tactics and this does not make the police look good.Murphy goes home, checks his phone messages on his anwsering machine, and is about to relax when he hears someone at the door fumbling with the lock. He pulls out his .38 pistol, only to find his girlfriend Kate (Candy Clark) and her son. They have a bit of discussion about their future, and she eventually leaves.The following evening, Murphy decides to check out Councilwoman McNealy's residence, now a crime scene, having heard that McNealy has died in the hospital, and the Watts district is in an uproar as racial tentions are starting to escalate. Detectives have already gone through it, retrieving most evidence they can find. However, Murphy is able to find a piece of paper lodged in a tree. Just when he gets back to his car, his pager goes off. He finds a public phone and call back to base... Captain Braddock wants him back at the base ASAP.Murphy returns to base, only to find Captain Braddock with two strangers dressed in black business suits, who introduce themselves as Mr. Fletcher (David Sheiner) and Mr. Icelan (Paul Roebling). The two 'men in black' announce that Metro is going be the testing ground for a new $5 million goverment built helicopter, and Murphy has been selected as the senior test pilot, and will be observing the demonstration. They get into a van and drive off outside the city. Murphy asks what is this about, Icelan replies that soon, it'll be 1984 Summer Olympics, which will attract all sorts of rabblerousers... terrorists, and what-not. Thus, some contingencies must be planned, such as this thing they're about to see.The van drives out into the desert, and approximately at sunrise, they arrive at the test range, along with various other observers: officers from various other law enforcement and military agencies, and many civilian contractors. The demonstration is for this new helicopter nicknamed ""Blue Thunder"", fully armored, and has a chain-gun in the nose capable to dealing out precise firepower. The chopper is also a full surveillance platform, with video, infra-red, and audio capabilities, as well as a ""whisper mode"" which cancels a lot of the noise from the rotor blades, and turbine boost for the two turbines for extra amount of power. It also has access to almost any computer database in the world.The chopper makes a impressive demonstration, eradicating red targets (for terrorists) quickly and efficiently, but it does take out a few white targets (civilians) as well. Murphy remarks to Braddock, who replies that one civilian dead for every 10 terrorists is an acceptable ration. Murphy replies sarcastically. When ""Blue Thunder"" lands, Murphy is surprised to recongize the pilot whom is old nemesis: Colonel Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), the commander of his unit in Vietnam. Cochrane is surprised as well to run into Murphy. It is clear that both men do not like each other very much as Cochrane makes some sarcastic quirks to Murphy who quietly bushes it off. In private, Fletcher and Icelan talk with Cochrane about that they didn't know that he knew Murphy. Cochrane quickly dismisses Murphy as ""no threat"" to the program to Fletcher and Icelan. To make sure of this, Cochrane orders Fletcher and Icelan to have Murphy on a ""check flight"" the next day.Back at Metro Headquarters, Murphy finds Montoya (Joe Santos) and asks him about that ""note"" he found in McNealy's place which is in Spanish and to translate it for him.Next day, Cochrane is out first... and sabotages Murphy's helicopter for some reason by tampering with a wire in the engine. During the day, Cochrane pilots Blue Thunder, with Murphy and Lymangood piloting the faulty chopper. Before the flight, Lymangood tells Murphy that he heard that Murphy had actually did a 360 vertical loop in a helicopter. Cochrane walks by and remarks that the move is physically impossible.After a series of maneuvers, Murphy's chopper loses control of the engine and has to auto-rotate to a landing. After failing to land on top of a passing yellow school bus, Murphy crash lands his helicopter on a construction shack instead in the Watts neighhood. The construction workers help Murphy and Lymangood out while keeping a crowd of angry and racist black and Latino citizens at bay.Later that day, Montoya meets with Murphy for he has translateted the note which tells something about some weird people in the barrio making trouble, and something about ""THOR"". Both Murphy and Montoya have no idea what it stands for.The next morning, Murphy confronts Cochrane in a parking garage about his suspicions that he may have sabatoged his helicopter in trying to kill him for some irrational grudge against him steming from their service in Vietnam. Cochrane (clearly revealed as a charming sociopath at this point to the viewers) calmly denies any wrongdoing and tells Murphy that HE is the one who has a problem with him over being too soft-hearted.A little later, Braddock approaches Murphy claiming that Cochrane had just told him that Murphy threatened him with physical harm in the parking garage (with Cochrane naturally playing-acting as the ""poor, innocent victim""). Murphy tells Braddock that Cochrane is lying and he has an agenda. Braddock wants to belive Murphy, but tells him to stay away from Cochrane to avoid any further hassles.That evening, Cochrane's attempt to kill Murphy apparently didn't prevent both Murphy and Lymangood from flying the Blue Thunder for a test flight at night. Lymangood has previously learns that everything recorded onboard the Blue Thunder goes into a special tape deck below. Murphy and Lymangood take off to test the Blue Thunder.The first thing Murphy and Lymangood do is take out the fuse for the cockpit voice recorder, so they can have a private conversation. They agree on where to stash the fuse for later use.They find plenty of harmless targets to test the various capabilities. Just as they are returning, they spot Cochrane and Fletcher leaving the Metro building. Instead of returning to base and landing, they decide to follow Cochrane to see what he is up to, and they end up in the Federal Building downtown. Lymangood starts playing with the computer, looking up his own information, and it's amazingly complete. Murphy tries to look up his own info, but gets: ""FILE UNDER REPAIR"". He tries to search Cochrane, and gets a long military service history, as well as ""currently assigned to Project THOR"". An inquiry about Project THOR shows that T.H.O.R. stands for Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response. Murphy orders the whisper mode activated, thermal vision activated, and audio surveillance activated, as they search the Federal Building for Cochrane, and they find him, along with other people in the project, discussing the killing of McNealy, about how McNealy realized that they're stirring up trouble so she HAD to go, and how Murphy is becoming a problem and will be taken care of soon. Cochrane eagerly offers to kill Murphy himself and claims that he wished he had done it in Vietnam. The group agrees and permits Cochrane to kill Murphy whenever he feels the time will be right. It is right then when Cochrane looks out the window... only to see Blue Thunder looking back at him! Blue Thunder quickly returns to base.At the base, Lymangood quickly ""borrows"" the code cards to remove the videotape, before any one else can get to it, while Murphy goes to find Braddock to tell him what he heard, only to find Icelan standing beside Braddock in Braddock's office, thus leaving Murphy with no choice but to keep silent. Murphy sees Lymangood removing the videotape from the helicopter, but plenty of people also see him do it.Later that night, Lymangood returns home, only to find his place burglarized, and a stranger sitting in his chair. Before he can utter a sound, he gets hit from behind and tied up, and his mouth taped up. The same perp who was at the NcNealy attack and a part of the Cochrane conspiracy meeting at the Federal building is outside in his car waiting for them. The two thugs tell Lymangood that they want the videotape, and they are willing to torture Lymangood to get it. They start by breaking one of Lymangood's fingers. Lymangood fakes compliance, and is able to disable the two attackers in his house. After subduing both of them, he runs outside, and the third perp chases him in the car. Lymangood almost gets away except when he runs into a bicyclist and falls, and gets run over by the perp and dies at the scene.Murphy, who was on the way to Lymangood's house, happens upon the scene as a paramedic team is putting Lymangood into a body bag. Murphy angrily curses at himself, but he knows that he has to get away, for whoever killed Lymangood will pin the killing on him. Murphy gets away before a squad car arrives on the scene.The next morning at Astro Division HQ., Murphy sneaks into the main hangar and into Blue Thunder. He reinserts the fuse into the cockpit voice recorder and finds Lymangood's last audio message: he hid the videotape in a dumpster out by a drive-in theater's projection shack. Murphy is deciding what to do when a mechanic knocks on the window and shouts: ""Hey! You're not supposed to be in there!"" Murphy thinks for a second, then pulls his pistol and points it at the mechanic, who quickly flees. Murphy quickly dons the helmet and starts the engines, and takes off. While Cochrane and others are deciding what to do next, they see Murphy take off in Blue Thunder.Murphy quickly uses the mobile operator on board the helicopter to place two phone calls, one to Alf Hewitt (James Murtaugh), a Channel 8 investigative reporter, and one to Kate asking her to go find the tape at the dumpster and deliver it to the Channel 8 studio. Cochrane and the members of the conspracy overhear Murphy's two phone calls and decide to kill him before he goes public with what he knows.Kate arrives at the drive-in theater. Seeing no one, she crashes through the front gate. The cleaner sees this and quickly calls the police. After some frantic searching, Kate finds the videotape, but only by jumping into the dumpster herself. She pulls it out just as a police car arrives. Murphy returns to escort Kate to the Channel 8 news building. Kate, being a pretty crazy driver, is able to evade pursuit by several police cars.Meanwhile, a SWAT team armed with heavy machine guns have boarded two helicopters, and have appeared on either side of Murphy. However, Murphy does not react at first. When one helicopter opens fire, Murphy responds by knocking the front searchlight off the shooter, then puts just a few bullets into the engine to force the helicopter down. The other chopper opens fire, but with little effect since most of the bullets bounce off harmlessly at Blue Thunder's thick armor. Murphy flies down into the L.A. reservoir channels, and in a series of tight turns, the police chopper, heavily laden, is unable to make a turn and crashes into a pillar, fortunately suffering no casualties.Back on the ground at police headquarters, Cochrane and his team are portraying Murphy to reporters and everyone else as a madman who killed his partner and is now in the sky doing terrorist acts (having fabricated Murphy's personnel file to include a vast list of false crimes). They convince Braddock and the local mayor (Jason Bernard) to ask the Air Force for help. Two F-16 fighter jets are scrambled.Elsewhere, Kate is driving calmly when another police car recognizes her after being contacted by Cochrane to detain her. She tries to evade, but her small car cannot outrun a police car. She is stopped on a bridge when cornered by two police cars. The officers, with pistols drawn, order her out of her car when Murphy shows up in Blue Thunder. When the officers are distracted, she drives away. Murphy activates the cannon and fires a quick burst, cutting a police car in half and forcing the rest of the police cars to flee, but again causing no police casualties.Kate makes it to Channel 8 news station. She has the tape still in the ""eraser"" container, which can be remotely activated to erase the contents of the tape. She enters and finds the lobby in chaos from the people asking about what is going on. She looks for Alf Hewitt, but she is told by the lobby receptionist that he's busy on a story. Just then, Fletcher arrives and pretends to be Hewitt's producer, and tries to charm the supicious Kate to give him the tape. Hewitt appears and is ready to take Kate away, and claims that has never saw Fletcher in his life. Fletcher tries to fight them for the tape, and pulls out a gun. The lobby security guard strikes Fletcher behind the ear with his gun knocking him out. Fletcher still has the grip on the cover, and as he falls, he pulls the cover off the tape. Just then, Cochrane and his boss (unable to find the code to the video cover to erase the tape) orders the ""eraser"" activated for all the videotapes, but it's too late for the tape is no longer in the cover.Meanwhile, the two Air Force fighters are approaching downtown L.A. Murphy sees them, then slows to a hover... right above the smokestack of a barbeque shack in nearby Chinatown. When one of the F-16 fighters opens fire with a Sidewinder missile, it goes astray and blows up the BBQ restaurant to bits, raining chicken all over the area. The two jet fighters fly off to regroup. The other fighter decides to take a shot. This time, Murphy hovers between the Arco towers over downtown, just as a SWAT team arrives to order everyone out of the area. The Sidewinder missile, delfected by the reflection of the sun onto the building, hits the Arco Tower instead, raining debris down below.The two fighters circle, but Murphy's not done. He activates the cannon, and with a long-range burst, catches one of the F-16's in the wing. The pilot ejects while the second F-16 retreats.At Astro Division HQ, a Hughes MD5 Defender chopper has arrived, armed with two powerful 20mm guns with armor-piercing bullets. Cochrane suddenly orders the existing pilot out as he'll fly the thing... wanting to kill Murphy himself. Cochrane requests permission to take off. The mayor, having lost two police helicopters, a BBQ shack, one F-16, AND a part of a skyscraper, has had enough, and denies permission to take off. Cochrane takes off anyway, with steel-like determination to kill Murphy.Meanwhile, Alf Hewitt and Kate are watching the tape in his office, and Hewitt was amazed at the content: it's a Federal government conspiracy to stir up trouble in the barrio, so that they can get funding for this armed helicopter program! Thus, Murphy is not only NOT insane, he could be ""the hottest thing since Horatius at the bridge"", according to Hewitt. He makes a call to someone.Back up in the air, Murphy is watching the F-16 pilot drifting back down to earth under his parachute when the evil Cochrane attacks from his blind-side. The heavy cannons punch through the cockpit and wound Murphy, causing damage to the Blue Thunder chopper, as well as jam the nose turret into a ""straight-ahead"" position. Murphy quickly goes into evasive maneuvers, as the two adversaries dogfight among the skyscrapers and landmarks of the city in a climatic aerial battle. Murphy tries to set an ambush by turning around and hovering behind a building and opens fire, but Cochrane gets away, as his lighter armored chopper is faster and more maneuverable. And with a bit more maneuvering, he's right back behind Blue Thunder and Murphy, who's busy dodging bullets among abandoned factories.In another flashback to Vietnam, it is revealed that Cochrane was the soldier who pushed the North Vietnamese soldier out of the hovering helicopter that Murphy was flying, and thus tried to court-marial Murphy for insubordination to cover up the killing.Back in the present, with Blue Thunder now the hunted, a desperate Murphy decides on a gamble to end it all. He enables the helicopter's turbine boost on both engines, and goes for the 360 vertical loop. Cochrane tries to follow. The Blue Thunder completes the loop, and the cannon is heading up, as Cochrane's chopper is stuck in the sky, trying to loop but can't. Murphy opens fire with the cannon... and Cochrane's chopper explodes, killing the psychopath at last.As it begins to get dark, Murphy spots a freight train traveling at a moderate speed. He lands ahead of the train, and tries to get out before the train hits. The train, unable to stop in time, smashes the chopper into pieces in a final big explosion. The final shot shows an exhausted Murphy walking away from the remains of Blue Thunder.Freeze frame. In a final voiceover by Alf Hewitt, he reports that Murphy ran out of fuel and destroyed the prototype helicopter and he begins to talk more about a goverment conspiracy behind the construction of Blue Thunder."
Yentl,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086619/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Jewish girl disguises herself as a boy to enter religious training. Eastern Europe, 1904. A Jewish woman, Yentl, has a thirst for knowledge but is prohibited from learning due to the restrictions of her religion. When her father dies, she sets off to increase her knowledge, posing as a man in order to gain admission to a Jewish religious school.—grantss 1904. Teenage Yentl lives in an Eastern European village with her widowed father, Reb Mendel. Rather than become a devoted wife to whoever her husband to be - her obligation under Jewish custom - Yentl would like to study the Talmud, a right reserved solely for men. She has no intention ever to be that subservient wife to any man. Her understanding father does oblige her wish to study the Talmud under his tutelage, but with the stipulation that it be done in secret so as not to raise the ire of the community in general. But when Reb Mendel passes away, Yentl, having had a taste of that knowledge, decides to leave her hometown so that she can don a disguise as a man - she calling herself Anschel - to continue her study of the Talmud. She is initially able to do so meeting and infiltrating a group of scholarly young men who are studying the Talmud under the direction of Reb Alter Vishkower. Beyond needing to avoid situations where her true identity as a female would be discovered, Yentl finds her life unexpectedly more complicated when she falls in love with one of her colleagues, Avigdor, who, in turn is already engaged to that devoted woman, Hadass. Through her friendship with Avigdor and by association Hadass, Yentl begins to understand something that she has been taught under the Talmud, that the Talmud is not an end unto itself, but rather a means to another end, namely life, as Yentl can see the love that exists between Avigdor and Hadass, and like Hadass would do anything for Avigdor, even what may seem the impossible, such as a request Avigdor asks of his male friend, Anschel.—Huggo In an Ashkenazic shtetl in Poland, Yentl Mendel is the boyishly klutzy daughter and only child of long widowed Rebbe (""Talmud Teacher"") Mendel, who teaches Talmud (a codification of Jewish Law) to local boys - and to Yentl, but secretly because girls were not allowed to learn the law in those days. When her father dies, Yentl is all alone in the world. She takes the momentous decision to leave the village and - disguised as a boy and calling herself by the name of her late brother, Anshel - seeks and gets admitted to a Yeshiva, to study the texts, traditions, subtleties and complexities of Torah, Talmud, etc. She befriends Avigdor who is engaged to Haddas, but her family discovers his brother committed suicide so they call off the wedding (in case Avigdor possesses the same madness). Anshel then finds ""him""-self in the awkward position of being called into service as substitute bridegroom, so that the wedding can go ahead and Haddas will have a husband. It is a marriage that never gets consummated - apart from the more obvious reasons, because Haddas still wants Avigdor (though she eventually falls in love with Yentl, too). After numerous complications (including Avidor and Yentl falling in love with each other, briefly, after she reveals her secret to him, along with her bosom), the film ends with everybody getting what they always wanted - Haddas and Avigdor to live happily ever after with each other, while Anshel, now Yentl once again, goes off to America to pursue her dream of serious study in Yeshiva, where she will be able to study without needing to hide her identity as a woman.—Micheal McLoughlin"
Silkwood,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086312/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A worker at a plutonium processing plant is purposefully contaminated, psychologically tortured and possibly murdered to prevent her from exposing worker safety violations at the plant. Fairly accurate recounting of the story of Karen Silkwood, the Oklahoma nuclear-plant worker who blew the whistle on dangerous practices at the Kerr-McGee plant and who died under circumstances which are still under debate. Karen Silkwood lives a free-spirited existence with two friends, Drew Stephens and Dolly Pelliker, who work with her at an Oklahoma nuclear facility. It's only when she discovers she has been exposed to radiation that Karen's conscience awakens, and soon she is digging for evidence of wrongdoing. But her sudden zeal for safer working conditions may come at a high price as she alienates friends...and possibly even puts her own life in peril.—MGM/UA Home Video ""There's a moral imperative here."" Silkwood (1983) by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen is an historical drama about a 28-year-old plutonium processing worker, ""Karen Silkwood"" (Meryl Streep), who aligns with the Union to secretly gather evidence of Kerr-McGee plant's safety violations. The hope is to gain leverage for upcoming contract negotiations, which Karen thinks is a good thing for her co-workers, but many of them fear for their jobs as well as for Karen's own safety, more than they fear being proverbial ""canaries in the coal mine."" The threat of cancer from plutonium exposure seems less important than losing their income. Nonetheless, Karen pushes ahead, despite being warned that what she's doing is dangerous. The danger becomes real when Karen realizes she's been intentionally contaminated-and then accused of contaminating herself--which is ridiculous considering the torturous shower and scrub she must endure every time she sets off the radiation alarm. Things come to a head when her entire home is stripped of its contents-due to plutonium contamination-and she gets tested to confirm her ""internal"" contamination. No doubt, this would have been a good place for Karen's activism to stop, but Karen attends yet another union meeting-after which an attendee recalls seeing her leave with documents. While on the way to meet with a New York Times journalist and union official, Karen is killed in a front-end crash into a ditch. The car appeared to be run-off the road, but, because sedatives were found in her system, it was deemed an accident. The epilogue of the film states that no documents were ever found in Karen's car, but that the Oklahoma plant closed down a year later, leaving the audience with the mistaken impression that Kerr-McGee went out of business, which did not happen. A significant detail, which the film doesn't cover, is the fact that the rear of Karen's vehicle had unexplained damage, suggesting that it was pushed.—T. Bear Hayes In 1974, Karen Silkwood (Meryl Streep) and co-workers Drew Stephens (Kurt Russell) and Dolly Pelliker (Cher) arrive for work at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron nuclear facility near Cimarron City, Oklahoma. Karen works in Dry Processing, which involves processing plutonium and uranium oxide into nuclear fuel pellets. The plant manager conducts new trainees through the plant, and when asked about the effects of radiation exposure, answers that radiation is like sunburn, the kind of thing that cannot hurt you unless you are careless with it. When the lunch bell rings, Karen removes her protective gloves and attempts to rush out of her work area, but is called back by her fellow workers for not monitoring herself. She passes her bare hands across a radiation detector before leaving.In the lunchroom, Karen hears about a truck that became contaminated with radiation as the result of a container leak. She learns that her boyfriend, Drew, will have to work an hour late, and she cannot find the foreman Mace Hurley (Bruce McGill) to ask permission to have Saturday and Sunday off to see her children. She notices Winston (Craig T. Nelson), a new worker in X-Ray Metallography. Drew asks in case she likes him, but Karen responds, ""As a matter of fact, he's the type I hate."" When she catches up with Hurley, Karen is informed that the plant operates 24 hours a day, and it is not possible to give her time off.As Karen attempts to get one of her unwilling co-workers to take her weekend shifts, an alarm sounds. They believe it to be a test, but remark that, although test alarms are sounded regularly, they never actually evacuate the building, probably because it would shut down production. Gilda Schultz (E. Katherine Kerr) finally agrees to take Karen's weekend shifts. That night, as Karen goes to her car, she hears a noise and goes to investigate. She sees a truck being cut apart by security guards, but when she asks what is going on, she is ordered to leave.On Saturday morning, Karen, Drew and Dolly drive to Texas to take her three children to the beach. However, Karen's ex-husband, Pete Dawson (Ray Baker), has the weekend off himself, and speaks Karen she should have spoken to him as he has made his own weekend plans. He does allow Karen to take the children to a restaurant for a brief visit. On the way back to Oklahoma, Dolly asks how long Karen was married to Pete. Karen confesses that although they went to Louisiana, where they believed they could be married underage, they could not, and never actually were legally married. However, they were formally divorced because their union was recognized as a common law marriage. Karen laments that she had the children in the car, and could have driven them to Oklahoma, but did not.Arriving at work on Monday, Karen is approached by a friend named Joe (Will Patton), who mentions he helped bury a contaminated truck Friday night. As she gets ready in the changing room, Karen learns that Gilda did not work her shifts, but Gilda informs her that the plant was shut down because of a contamination in their section right after Karen left. Gilda also mentions that the company believes Karen was responsible for the contamination in order to get the weekend off. She enters her work area wearing a full hazmat suit, and finds her co-workers similarly clad as the walls of the room are being scrubbed down by a cleanup crew. She complains about being unfairly blamed for the contamination, but Quincy Bissell (Henderson Forsythe), the union shop steward, informs her that the company has to blame somebody or risk accountability.Back in the plant, Thelma Rice (Sudie Bond), an older worker and friend of Karen's, is cooked in a radiation accident. Thelma is taken to the decontamination room where she is showered down. Afraid that Thelma will get cancer as a result of her exposure, Karen urges the woman to listen to the doctor, who informs her that she only had surface exposure, and is in no danger after being scrubbed clean. Later, at home, Karen learns from Drew that Thelma only received 24 dpm's (disintegrations per minute) of radiation, which he dismisses as ""not super bad"". He asks in case Karen is just waking up to the potential danger of working with nuclear materials after almost two years.The next day, as she speaks with her co-workers, Karen realizes that the doctor never gave Thelma a nasal smear, so he does not really know in case she suffered any internal contamination. She urges Thelma to get the procedure. Later, Mace Hurley interrupts a birthday celebration for Gilda Schultz, and orders the Dry Processing employees to get back on the job. In case they do not meet their contract goals, they will all be out of work. Karen attempts to pick up some birthday cake that has fallen onto the floor, but Hurley orders her to clean it up after her shift. As Karen leaves the Dry Processing room after vacuuming up the cake, she begins the contamination alarm. She is scrubbed down, and ordered by the plant doctor to bring in urine samples every week.Later, Karen looks through a book supplied by the union, but which she is only now reading. She informs Dolly that all the information about ""acceptable levels"" of radiation is false, and that exposure to plutonium gives you cancer. Still later, Drew brings home news that Karen has been transferred out of Dry Processing into the Metallography department. She is angry, because the transfer means she will have to work three months before she can again qualify for overtime work. On her new assignment, Winston explains her duties, which include making photographic records of fuel rod samples. Karen catches Winston doctoring the photographic negatives to cover up imperfections in the fuel rods.At a union meeting, shop steward Quincy informs the workers that Kerr-McGee has obtained enough signatures to hold a desertification vote. When he seeks volunteers to help him reach out to union members, Karen volunteers. Drew does not believe Karen has the political skills to be an effective negotiator, but she believes she can sit across the table from Mace Hurley as an equal. In time, Dolly begins dating a beautician named Angela (Diana Scarwid). Drew becomes angry when Angela moves into the house Dolly and Karen share, and Karen spends all her time on the phone with union matters. Karen suggests to Quincy that they involve the national union in their cause, and they land a meeting in Washington, D.C. with the national union and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The president of the national union informs Quincy and Karen that they can only win the desertification election based on health and safety issues, and promises to send doctors to talk with the Cimarron workers. The union president leaves to catch a plane, but Karen follows and informs him about the doctoring of the cross-section photographs of fuel rods intended for the Hanford, Washington, Breeder Reactor. The union president asks for proof of her claims.Back in Oklahoma, Drew is angry when Quincy shows slides of the Washington, D.C. trip, and in the photos, Karen appears to be flirting with attorney Paul Stone. On their way home, Drew asks in case the company was aware of Karen's trip to Washington, and that she is spying for the union. He informs Karen that he quit working for Kerr-McGee, and moves out of the house.In the Metallography department, Karen goes through Winston's desk drawer looking for doctored photographic negatives. Winston catches her, but she convinces him she was only using the drawer to store allergy medications not allowed in the plant. After doctors speak to the Kerr-McGee workers, Winston confronts union lawyer Paul Stone (Ron Silver), questioning why the union has only come in now that there is a pending desertification vote. He believes the company is looking out for its employees, and that in case issues are raised, Kerr-McGee will shut down the plant, putting the locals out of work while Stone will return to his job in Washington, D.C. Paul Stone does return to Washington, and he falls out of communication with Karen. She calls to inform him that the union won the election, 80 to 61, but only reaches his answering machine.Some time later, Angela returns to her husband, leaving Dolly feeling rejected, just as Karen feels rejected by Paul Stone. At the plant, Gilda Schultz mentions that her husband has been working late flushing out pipes because the plant has come up more than a kilo short on plutonium. When Karen takes notes, her co-workers leave the room, concerned that her union activities will threaten their jobs. Karen finally speaks with Paul about several incidents at the plant, but he is more concerned with evidence of the doctored photographic negatives. Karen is shunned by management as well as her fellow employees. When she goes to Dry Processing in an attempt to speak with Gilda, she is rebuffed, and as she leaves the area and flashes her hand in front of the radiation monitor, she again begins the alarm. Although the plant doctor informs her that the exposure level was acceptable, he orders her to start bringing in her urine samples on a daily basis.In declining health, Karen hits a deer as she drives home, and asks a passerby to call Drew. Soon, when she comes into work, she begins a radiation alarm as she enters the plant. A team is sent to her house with a Geiger counter, finds the building contaminated, and takes everything out of the house. Mace Hurley suggests that Karen contaminated her own house, believing she would do anything to hurt the company. In response, Karen believes her urine samples have been tampered with. She is informed that her latest nasal smear has a reading of 45,000 dpm. Hurley offers to get Karen a place to stay and help her with money, but first she must make a statement in her own words about what happened. She refuses, and drives away.Drew returns to the stripped house to reminisce about his days there with Karen, and takes the spare key left above the door frame as a souvenir. Winston drives up and asks what Drew is doing there. Unable to contain his rage, Drew hits Winston, knocking him to the ground. He returns to his new home and finds Karen there. She informs him the company has contaminated her and is trying to kill her. Drew makes plans to take Karen to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where doctors are well versed in the effects of radiation. There, doctors inform Drew and Dolly that, although they have been exposed through contact with Karen, their radiation is within safe levels. However, Karen is informed that they have discovered americium, an element released when plutonium disintegrates. Based on the level of americium, they have determined that she has a level of six nano curies in her body. The maximum body burden for occupational exposure is 40 nano curies; however, the tests she has undergone may be off by as much as 300 percent.Afterward, Karen telephones Paul Stone, asking him to come to Oklahoma City with a reporter from The New York Times. Back home, Drew suggests they move to New Mexico and have babies, but Karen fears they would have developmental defects. The next morning, Karen leaves for a union meeting and asks Drew to pick up Paul Stone and the New York Times reporter at the airport. At night, after she leaves a cafe, a car follows Karen. The high-beam glare of headlights from the pursing car in her rearview mirror blinds her. Karen's car is later found crashed by the side of the road. Her tombstone reads: Karen Gay Silkwood; February 19, 1946 - November 13, 1974; Rest in Peace.The film concludes with a title that reads: ""The precise circumstances of Karen's death are unknown. It is also not known whether she had any documents with her. None were found. An autopsy revealed a high level of the tranquilizer Methaqualone and some alcohol in her bloodstream. Oklahoma police ruled her death a single car accident. A year later the plant closed down."""
Psycho II,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086154/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After twenty-two years of psychiatric care, Norman Bates attempts to return to a life of solitude, but the specters of his crimes - and his mother - continue to haunt him. It's 22 years later. And Norman Bates is coming home. After being judged as ""legally sane"" in a court of law, Norman Bates is released from a mental institution, against the protests of Lila Loomis (the sister of Marion Crane). Upon his return to his home (and the motel which lays in its shadow) Norman strikes up a friendship with Mary, a waitress at a local diner. Just as he tries to adjust back to normality, the murders around the site of the Bates Motel. Has Mrs. Bates returned to pull Norman's strings again, or is the bloodbath someone else's handy work? Now declared legally sane, Norman Bates is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement over the protests of Marion Crane's sister Lila Loomis, who insists that he's still a killer and that the court's indifference to his victims by releasing him is a gross miscarriage of justice. Norman returns to his motel and the old Victorian mansion where his troubles started, and history predictably begins to repeat itself.—alfiehitchie Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after being pronounced of sound mind by his psychiatrist, Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia) after 22 years. At the hearing preceding Norman's release, Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest, producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane, one of Norman's victims (from the first film), and the widow of Sam Loomis, who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition, she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home, the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel. A car is parked by the motel, which belongs to Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz)--the current owner of the motel. Dr. Raymond offers to introduce Norman to him, but Norman says it can wait until later. Walking up the steps to the house, Norman thinks he sees someone in his mother's bedroom window. Dr. Raymond says there hasn't been a tenant in the house for years. Norman admits he is just nervous about being back after such a long time away.Inside the house, all the furniture is covered up with sheets. Dr. Raymond asks Norman if he wants to stay somewhere else, but Norman insists on being back at home. Dr. Raymond reminds Norman that, with him living back at home, the memories from his past are likely to reoccur, but he is confident that Norman can handle it now. Dr. Raymond regrets that there won't be a trained social worker to check in on Norman occasionally, due to budget cutbacks, however Norman says that at least Dr. Raymond will come by from time to time to see him. Dr. Raymond informs Norman that the telephone has been reconnected, and that he is to report to work at noon for a pre-arranged job as a short-order cook and dishwasher at a diner down the road from the motel.After Dr. Raymond leaves, Norman takes his suitcase upstairs, and picks up the phone receiver and hears the dial tone. He sees a piece of paper under the phone, and picks it up. It is a note from Mother. It says, ""Norman, I'll be home late. Fix your own dinner. Love, M."" Suddenly, Norman is startled when he hears Mother's voice calling to him from her room. Norman then has a memory from his childhood. He sees his adolescent self reflected on the doorknob. Mother says, ""Norman! What did you put in my tea? (sounds of a glass breaking) I'm gonna get you for this, Norman. I'll show you what happens to bad little boys who poison their mothers--I'm gonna kill you! Her door slowly opens, and then a hand falls to the floor, writhes for a few seconds, and then lays still. Her door slams shut and Norman lets go of his suitcase, which tumbles down the stairs, his clothes spilling out.Norman arrives at the diner, and introduces himself to a kindly old woman named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar) who works as a hostess, waitress and cashier. She takes him back to the kitchen to meet Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne), the owner and short-order cook. Norman's other co-workers include a grouchy waitress named Myrna (Lee Garlington), and Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress who is less than stellar at her job, only having worked there for the past four days. Emma Spool gets Norman an apron and tells him to take the meal orders while dishwashing and helping Ralph around the stove. When Mary accidentally knocks a pie plate off a table, sending a piece of pie and a large knife to the floor. Ralph angrily asks her what happened. Norman covers for Mary and says that he did it. Ralph lets Norman off the hook and gets him started with some duties, including reading off orders that the waitresses bring back.Later that night, Norman leaves the diner and starts to head back home, when he hears Mary shouting on a payphone, arguing with her boyfriend. She hangs up the phone, and when Norman asks what happened, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a temporary place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel for free. They start walking just as a thunderstorm is forming in the sky. They get back to the motel just as the rain starts pouring down. Norman goes into the office and reaches for the key to cabin #1, but he grabs a different key instead. He tells her to wait there while he checks the bed linen in the cabin. Then, Warren Toomey enters, startling Mary. He asks her if she wants to rent a room, but she says that Norman is taking care of it. Norman comes back, and tells Mary to go up to the house and wait for him. She leaves, and Norman puts a handful of drug paraphernalia down on the desk and questions Warren about it. Norman discovers the motel is now a sleazy hookup location run by the equally sleazy Mr. Toomey. Norman fires Toomey and tells him to be gone by the next night.Back in the house, Norman makes a sandwich for Mary. She finds a knife in a drawer and asks him to cut it for her, and he is very nervous about holding a knife again. He reluctantly cuts the sandwich, but Norman's odd behavior is creeping out Mary. She initially decides against staying with him, but Norman convinces her to stay by telling her that this is the first night back in the house after being institutionalized for so long, and is scared to be alone by himself. Norman takes her upstairs and gets some bedding for her to use. Mary goes into Norman's mother's room, but Norman suggests she sleep in his room. Norman is apprehensive about going into his mother's room, because he tells her that is where some of his ""troubles"" happened. Mary coaxes Norman into the room by reassuring him there are no ghosts in there. The room is mostly bare, except for some of the furniture which is all covered up with more sheets. The bed mattress is rolled up as well. Norman goes into his room and tosses the bedding on top of his bed and closes the door so she can get settled in for the night. Norman says goodnight, turns the lights off, and sleeps on the couch downstairs. Mary jams the door shut from the inside by putting a chair underneath the doorknob.The next morning, Norman is at the diner chopping lettuce when Mary comes in. She tells him she has decided to stay with a friend in town, rather than with Norman. Just then, a drunk Warren Toomey walks in, and goes to the kitchen window and talks to Ralph and mockingly inquires about Norman's job performance and then he sits down in a booth. Norman is reading off more orders that are placed on a wheel, while Ralph prepares the food. Mary starts to take Warren's order. Instead, Toomey insults her and suggests that she and Norman had slept together the previous night. Norman is slowly becoming angry at Warren's remarks, but tries to maintain his composure. Norman grabs an order off the wheel, but instead it is a note from Mother! It says ""Don't let that whore in my house again!"" Norman is shocked by this, and bumps into the french fry fryer, spraying hot oil on Ralph's arm.Enraged, Norman confronts Toomey, and Toomey picks a fight with Norman in front of the customers. Norman sees a knife laying nearby and Warren goads Norman into picking it up and using it. Norman doesn't pick it up, and Warren calls him a ""chicken,"" and then leaves. Norman is so traumatized by seeing the note, that he quits his job.Later that night, Mary comes back to the house and tells Norman she has reconsidered and would like to stay with him. She was very impressed with how he handled Toomey earlier. Mary goes upstairs to take a shower. Afterward, she has a funny feeling that she is being watched. In fact, there is a small peephole cut into the wall opposite the shower, and someone's eye is seen looking through the hole at her.Norman is playing the piano in the living room and is startled to hear a loud car horn blaring below. Warren Toomey is outside and he is very drunk, and he is honking the horn to get Norman's attention. He shouts that he is packing his things and moving out. Then the phone rings. Norman answers it, and after a pause, he says angrily, ""What? Who is this? My mother is dead! Mr. Toomey, if this is you, you're sicker than I ever was!"" Norman hangs up and looks out the front window. The lights to the office are still on, and Norman is convinced it was Toomey who called. Just then, a figure in a black dress comes into the office and murders Toomey by stabbing him as he packs to leave the motel. The murder goes unnoticed, as ""Mother"" spends all night in the motel parlor cleaning up the evidence of her crime.The next day, Norman's doctor, Dr. Raymond, pays a visit asking Norman why he quit his job at the diner and Norman tells Dr. Raymond that he has decided to dedicate himself to fixing up his motel to make it a legimate business. Norman also tells Dr. Raymond that he has been receiving notes as well as annymous phone calls from someone claiming to be his late mother. Dr. Raymond agrees to look into it.Up in the house, Mary is putting on makeup when she sees a flicker of light relfected in the bathroom mirror and realizes that there is a small hole in the wall leading to Mother's bedroom. Worried, Mary runs out of the house and down the hill where she meets with Norman still talking with Dr. Raymond. She casualy introduces herself to Norman's doctor and explains that she used to work at the diner as well and is now staying on the property to help Norman fix up his motel. Dr. Raymond thanks Norman for his time and drives away.Dr. Raymond goes to the police station in nearby Fairview where he meets Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) and tells him about Norman telling him about receiving prank phone calls from someone claiming to be his mother and wants a tap put on Norman's phone, but the sheriff refuses because there are no grounds for that nor has there been any evidence of a crime being committed as of yet. Dr. Raymond leaves and says that he will get to the bottom of what is going on at the Bates Motel.Later that day, while painting part of the motel building, Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he sees a figure standing in the window of this mother's old bedroom. He walks up to the house, where he enters his mother's old bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him into the attic, where he is locked in by an unseen person.While he is up there, another murder happens in the basement of the house: two teenagers sneak into the basement to smoke pot and make out, but suddenly the figure in the black dress appears and knifes the boy to death. The girl escapes and later returns with the sheriff. In the meantime, Mary finds Norman sleeping in the attic, but the door is unlocked.The sheriff and his deputy arrive at the Bates house where they ring the doorbell and they question Norman and Mary (both of them clearly acting very tense) about the alleged murder. The sheriff investigates the fruit cellar where the killing took place hours earlier, but finds it suspiciously neat and orderly. Norman is confused and wants to admit that something strange is going on, but Mary interjects and claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. Mary also give Norman an alibi by saying that she was with him all afternoon and they both were not in the house when the alleged murder took place. After the sheriff and deputy leave, Norman is aghast. ""Why did you lie to the sheriff like that?"" he asks. Mary says, ""I had to say something, they were going to arrest you!""All the evidence suggests that Norman is back to his old ways, but Mary is insistent. ""It couldn't have been you, you're not like that anymore."" Later that evening, Mary is startled when she discovers someone looking at her through the peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, but Norman is downstairs and out of reach... so it can't be him. Mary draws a gun and starts checking the house, but the gun saddens Norman. ""That's because of me, isn't it?"" he says. They are horrified to find a bloody rag that someone has stuffed down the bathroom toilet. Norman is despondent, convinced that his blackouts are re-ocurring and that he is responsible for the bloody rag, and whatever crime it is connected with.Mary says she's going down to check the motel, and one of the film's many plot twists occurs. In the parlor of the motel is Lila Loomis--Mary's mother. She's the one who has been calling Norman saying she's his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window, before disappearing and adding to his frail mental state. Mary has been helping her, and was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic as well as leaving all of the notes from Mother for Norman to find at the house and at the diner, but Mary's growing feelings for Norman have been causing her to reconsider her actions. It also explains how she knows Norman could not have been responsible for the murder of any young boy in the basement of the house because he was locked in the attic during that time. However, Lila sees the murder as a happy coincidence, not caring if Norman would be re-committed over a murder that wasn't his crime.The next day, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's true identity and informs Norman exactly who has been living with him. He also orders Norma Bates' body to be exhumed, just to prove to Norman that she can't be the one haunting him.Back at the house, when Norman confront's Mary, she admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, but that Lila won't stop. ""Why did you stop?"" Norman asks. Just then the phone rings, and Norman angrily answers it right away, saying ""Hello, Mrs. Loomis?"" Suddenly Norman's tone changes and he says ""I'm sorry... Mother."" Mary gets angry and picks up an extension to confront Lila, but there's nobody on the line with Norman as whoever was on the other line hangs up when Mary speaks into the phone.Mary goes to Lila's hotel and they have a big fight that's overheard by a hotel bartender. Mary tells Lila that she wants her to stop bothering Norman, and Lila accuses her of being in love with a psychopath. Lila, convinced that she's winning the ""good"" fight, hurries over to the house for one final push over the edge for Norman. She is being followed by Dr. Raymond.Lila sneaks into the cellar and removes her ""Mother"" costume from under a loose stone in the floor. However, she is confronted by another ""Mother"" figure in a black dress and is killed with a butcher knife through the mouth. Dr. Raymond enters the house looking around, and sees the cellar door wide open. He enters the cellar, but no one is in sight (implying that ""Mother"" may have hid the body and slipped away through the cellar exit which is never locked). Norman enters the cellar and asks Dr. Raymond what is he doing there. The doctor tells Norman that he has been following Lila Loomis, but Norman seems oddly disinterested, making Dr. Raymond leave.Meanwhile, Mary discovers that Mr. Toomey's car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Sheriff Hunt questions Mary about being the daughter of Lila Loomis and that Dr. Raymond had visited him to inform him about his suspicions about her. When Mary overhears the sheriff talking to his deputies about bringing Norman in for questioning she slips away.Mary returns to the house and tries to get Norman to escape with her. ""They'll lock you up again!"" she pleads. Norman refuses to run, and instead tries to get Mary to admit to what she's been doing to him. The phone rings at the house and Norman answers and starts to speak to his ""Mother"". But it is Dr. Raymond on the other line calling from the motel parlor who tells Norman that he contacted the local phone company and they had traced the phone calls to the house from the parlor phone at the motel. Once again, Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman (Dr. Raymond hangs up). But then, Norman begins talking about Mary to the voice on the phone and says ""Oh no, Mother. You can't make me... KILL her...""Terrified, Mary goes down to the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with a large butcher knife, and goes to confront Norman in the outfit. It is at this point that things rapidly spiral out of control. Norman refuses to acknowledge Mary standing in front of him in the costume, so Mary instead goes upstairs to the extension phone and tries to talk Norman into hanging up. But she hears on the other end that Norman is only talking to a dial tone... for there is no one on the other line. Mary realizes that Norman has turned completely insane again due to her and Lila's manipulation of events.Losing sight of Norman, Mary is startled when someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house to expose Norman's tormentors. Stabbed, Raymond's body falls over the balcony and lands in the foyer. Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a now deranged Norman, who swears to cover up for ""Mother."" ""Norman, I am not your mother, I am Mary!"" she frantically tells him. Norman tries to reach for the knife, but Mary stabs him in the chest. Norman backs Mary down the steps into the basement, and Mary keeps stabbing Norman, once in the palm of each hand. Norman grabs the knife blade firmly with both hands, with Mary still holding onto the other end, which severely cuts Norman's palms even further and a lot of blood pours out. Norman is weak from blood loss and stumbles on a pile of coal, knocking it loose and revealing Lila's body. Mary, distraught at seeing her mother's dead body, attacks him and is killed when the police enter and shoot her dead.At the police station that evening, the sheriff puts together a fairly inaccurate account of the what we know has happened, identifying Mary as the murderer of the teenage boy as well as Toomey, and that she may have killed Lila as well. Having received medical treatment for his wounds, Norman is sitting a short distance away in a daze and goes along with the story... and the movie goes on to its final twist.Norman returns to the Bates house where he shovels coal into the house furnace as well as wanders aimlessly around the house, now alone. A little later, Norman makes a sandwich for himself when a woman walks up the steps. Norman has boiled water and set a place for a meal when there is a knock at the back door; he answers the door to find Emma Spool, from the diner. Ms. Spool sits at the table and Norman gives her a cup of poison tea. Out of the blue, Norman asks her, ""Are you really my mother?"" She tells him that she is his real mother and that Norma Bates was her sister and his aunt. ""I was too young to have a baby, besides I had problems of my own,"" she tells him, alluding to the fact that she as well was institutionalized. ""You had already been put away by the time I got out. So I decided to wait for you."" She reveals that she's the one who has been killing anybody who would make trouble for her son. As she sips the poison tea, she begins to gag.Norman suddenly kills her with a blow to the head with the coal shovel. Emma's chair collapses underneath her and she tumbles onto the floor. As she lies dying, Norman closes the curtains to the kitchen and then picks up her body and carries her upstairs to his mother's room. The audience hears the familiar voice of Mother, warning Norman not to go messing with ""filthy girls"" again. The final shots show Norman (murderously psychotic once again) reopening the Bates Motel and standing in front of the house... waiting."

With threats against the school and the Native himself, the boys team together again for another scheme to get back at anyone trying to mess with Angel Beach.—Wallace Entertainment The film opens with images from the first part of Porky's.Edward ""Pee Wee"" Morris (Dan Monahan) wakes up shouting ""I've been laid!"" with joy. It's the following morning, after all the events in the first film. He increases the line in his maturity chart - the one he keeps under his mattress. His penis doesn't look as responsive as always, but he thinks it may be a resting time after the novelty of sex with a woman. His mother (Ilse Erl) enters his bedroom while he's got a boner - after watching topless women at  The National Geographic  magazine. Mrs. Morris is dumbfounded when she looks at Pee Wee's chart.Back at Angel Beach High School, Pee Wee brags about having Wendy Williams (Kaki Hunter) snatched from everybody else. His friends tease Pee Wee, saying that Wendy didn't think it was such a big thing. Wendy wants a better man - Wendy admits that it was all a prank planned by his friends: she really ended up satisfied.The Drama Club is producing a Shakespeare-based play for a theater festival. All the boys in the festival are participating. Pee Wee interrupts a natural sciences lesson - the vivisected frogs are disgusting. Pee Wee is blamed for a joke which was not even his, but the science teacher (Howard Neu) tells him off. Pee Wee is jealous of Wendy, who is talked about a lot. She says that she's faithful, that people will talk about her without really knowing her, and that boys will always brag about things they haven't really done. Pee Wee tries to trust her, and says that he'll ""kick the ass"" of any boy who badmouths her from that moment on.Tommy Turner (Wyatt Knight), Tim Cavanaugh (Cyril O'Reilly), Billy McCarthy (Mark Herrier) and Anthony ""Meat"" Tuperello (Tony Ganios) are part of Pee Wee's gang.

Pee Wee refuses to get on stage wearing his costume. When he is forced to come out on stage, he looks like a green Puck.Just then, Coach Ms. Beulah Balbricker (Nancy Parsons) and Reverend Bubba Flavel (Bill Wiley) arrive, demanding that the play be shut down for its content and that Johnny Henry has been cast as the lead role. The group takes their case to principal Mr. Floyd J. Carter (Eric Christmas) where the fanatical Rev. Flavel makes his case over it. Mr. Carter cannot stand up to Flavel's shouts and screams. Flavel and Balbricker allege that Shakespeare is filth. Carter dismisses them after reading romantic passages from the Bible to counter Flavel's ranting.That evening, Pee Wee finds another girl, and he takes her to the cemetery. He runs away. It's a prank; as Pee Wee shows himself stark naked. Laura gets undressed and wraps herself around Pee Wee. It looks like Laura is choking to death. Steve and Tommy say that Pee Wee is to blame for Laura's death. They can't call Ted (Art Hindle), the same cop who helped them out in the first film. Steve frightens Pee Wee, dressed as a zombie.

Balbricker sings and dances  Black Magic  while on the toilet. They open up the pipe and push the corn snake up. Balbricker runs in panic with her pants and panties down to the gym of the high school. All the school hears her screams and sees her. Everybody panics, especially two cheerleaders (Francine Joyce and Wendy Becker), when they see the snake crawl out of the girls locker room. Tommy picks up the harmless snake and the coaches congratulate him for that.Later that day, Carter interrupts rehearsals, when Johnny Henry was taking his role too realistically. Officially, the Shakespeare production is called off, but the classroom can rehearse as a private project classroom. One of them mentions that one of the commissioners exposed himself.Seward County Commissioner Gebhardt initially gestures Steve, Pee Wee, Wendy and the rest of the gang that Flavel's demands are ludicrous and unreasonable. The commissioners seem to think well of the production; Gebhardt praises them to fight for their ideals and for what they want. He tells them that he'll do a favor, in return of which he'll be offered another favor, and that's how things work, so they have nothing to worry about.The next evening, the gang finds John beaten to a pulp. The KKK opposes a Seminole character - his role is Romeo - to kiss a white girl - Wendy's role which is Juliet. A cross is burning next to him. 5,000 signatures are given to Geghardt against the play.The play neverless goes on. During the swordfight scene, Johnny's sword breaks and he has to pretend to keep on fighting with a broken sword in an absurd way. They give him the leg of a female mannequin.Flavel arrives and insists in shutting the production down just as Pee Wee in his green-skinned costume is giving his monologue. Anthony shows Flavel his balls. Mrs Morris tells him that the gesture wasn't helpful. Gebhardt gestures for the gang to keep calm, but he finally betrays them. Gebhardt is a pervert who will go out with Wendy, who is 17 and therefore still a minor. Wendy wants revenge.At Seward Court, in the basement, commissioners love silent black-and-white porn flicks (stag films). They make derogatory terms. Tommy records them with a tape audio recorder.Wendy prepares a punch which looks like vomit. She goes to La Fontana di voglio, a fancy restaurant to meet with Gebhardt for their date as he is friends with the Maitre d's (Robin Paradise and Ted Richert). Wendy is wearing large fake breasts with the fake vomit in them.At the rally, the KKK is led to the school gym away from the gathering talk to John. The gym is packed with Seminole Indians and hostile looking African American locals. Pee Wee and the gang tells the KKK that they want to shave the KKK members' heads in retribution for their assault on Johnny.At the restaurant, Wendy enters dressed and talking like a prostitute, shouting and making a big scene out of it so that everybody looks at her... which everybody does. She jumps on top of Gebhardt and tries to shag him there. She puts her boa hat on a gentleman (William Kerwin)'s head, and she sings that she's turning on 17 that day, and that she was 14 when she first met him. Wendy will cry rape if he goes away: she says that she's pregnant of him.Back at the rally, during Rev. Flavel's speech, he sees he KKK members appear stark naked with shaved heads. Then, the recording with the commissioners badmouthing Flavel and talking about the porn flick is played for everybody to hear. The public gets restless and Flavel loses it, swearing like a maniac to the press.At the restaurant, Wendy further humiliates herself and Gebhardt by getting drunk and drinks the gentleman's cup, and she repeats her date's name and position. Wendy then uses the fake vomit in her fake breasts and vomits in a pool, and all the restaurant-goers leave. The gentleman even saw Wendy take out the vomit from one of her fake breasts. Pee Wee appears and takes a picture of Gerbhardt in the fountain pool. They leave to the sound of  We're going to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz, because because because.... The news jumps to the newspapers and Gernhardt quits his post.In a montage of the closing;The Shakesperean Festival is on again, announced on the first page.Johnny is a hero with the play and the community.Wendy and Pee Wee are together again.The KKK members try to discreetly leave. One of them is kicked in the head by sweet ladies with umbrellas.The restaurant will be no more.Flavel tries to strangle one of his old accomplices."

Never Cry Wolf,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086005/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A government researcher, sent to research the ""menace"" of wolves in the north, learns about the true beneficial and positive nature of the species. The researcher Tyler is assigned by his government to travel to the Arctic to study the wolves that they believe are responsible for the reduction of the caribou population. The reckless pilot Rosie takes him to the wilderness and he is left alone with his supply in an extremely cold spot. He is saved by the local Ootek that is traveling with his dog sledding. He builds a shelter for Tyler and organizes his supplies. Tyler finds two wolves that he calls George and Angeline and their three offspring and he examines his excrement to learn what they eat. Soon he discovers that the wolves eat only mice and Tyler decides to do the same to prove to the government that the wolves do not eat caribous. Ootek returns with his friend Mike that speaks English and translates what Ootek say. The trio stays together and Tyler learns that Mike is a hunter. Mike travels with Ootek by canoe to see a herd of caribou that is attacked by a pack of wolves. Tyler examines the bones and finds that the animal was diseased, proving that the wolves are responsible for keeping the caribou strong as told by Ootek. Tyler finds Rosie with two hunters planning to explore the area with tourism and Tyler has an argument with the pilot and returns to the camp. He finds the three offspring but the wolves are missing. Tyler initially suspects of Rosie but when he sees the nervous Mike, he finds that he killed the animals.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil This film dramatizes the true story of Farley Mowat, when he was sent to the Canadian tundra area to collect evidence of the grievous harm the wolf population was allegedly doing to the caribou herds. In his struggle to survive in that difficult environment he studies the wolves, and realizes that the old beliefs about wolves and their supposed threat are almost totally false. Furthermore, he learns that humans represent a far greater threat to the land, and also to the wolves, a species which plays an important role in the ecosystem of the north.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> A young, naive Canadian biologist named Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) (portraying the real-life biologist Farley Mowat) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the local caribou population is declining, believed due to indiscriminate wolf-pack attacks. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by an odd, adventurous bush pilot named Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler and his gear in the middle of a frozen lake in a sub-zero Arctic nowhere. Unsure of where to start, Tyler's indecision quickly imperils him when he runs into a traveling wolf pack until he is rescued by a travelling elderly Inuit native named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who builds a shelter for him.Alone, Tyler's days are divided between research and mere personal survival, while nights are fraught with anxiety-born nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them, slowly dispelling their mutual fears. He and the wolves both begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them.As the spring season arrives and the winter snow slowly melts, Tyler (being a person of procedure) soon discovers the simple, blunt arctic is indifferent to his sense of order. First dealing with sub-freezing weather extremes, ranging from cold snow to warmer heavy spring rains, compromise his shelter, his paperwork duties, his research. Complicating matters further are an invasive horde of Arctic mice when they show up after the spring thaw: they are everywhere, frustrating him and the wolves. Yet the wolves seem to cope with the madness by eating the mice, which Tyler emulates in his own bizarre way to see if an animal can survive on mice alone.During the mild summer season, another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, who was sent by Ootek for companionship. Living in the nearist cities such as Yellowknife and the larger Edmondton metropolis, the younger Mike knows English and Inuit, translating in talks between Ootek and Tyler. Tyler's descriptions of his new lifestyle receive lengthy responses from Ootek, which Mike coyly translates as ""Good idea!"" Ootek, the elder, is content and curious, while Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his own social apprehensions between the old wondering Inuit way of life and living in the cities, including that of his deteriorating rotting teeth. Tyler soon discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts. Also, Tyler demonstrates a trick he's learned to Mike and Ootek: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, Tyler can give a fair imitation of a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.Fall nears, and Tyler hears that the caribou are migrating south, which will provide an opportunity for him to study the concept his superiors want to confirm; however, it also provides another bonding occasion between Tyler and the wolves as he helps drive caribou towards the pack, which soon takes a caribou down. Having gained the wolves' trust, Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased. It confirms the wolves, true to Inuit lore, are not the perceived ruthless, savage killers but rather Nature's instrument for keeping the caribou strong.Another day or two later, Tyler encounters Rosie nearby with two hunter-guests, making plans to commercially exploit the area's resources. Rosie's lot has improved, having moved up to a nicer turboprop bush plane on floats. Rosie insists on flying out Tyler, who defiantly refuses. Rosie then offers to extract Tyler from his research campsite in two days, the time it will take him to hike back to the nearest settlement. Tyler is alarmed at the realization that Rosie has already been to his camp.Tyler returns to the base to find things very still. He ventures into the wolves' territory and goes into their den, only to find the pups cowering in fear. Rosie's aircraft approaches outside. Believing that Rosie killed George and Angeline, Tyler goes out, angrily shouting at Rosie to leave. Rosie continues his approach until Tyler starts firing his shotgun at him. Rosie grimaces, then takes off, leaving Tyler behind.Tyler goes to his camp to find Mike resting, preparing for his final hike home to Yellowknife. Mike's nervous demeanour causes Tyler to suspect the truth: it was Mike, not Rosie, who shot and killed the wolves. Without saying it directly, Mike confirms Tyler's suspicions, revealing he has a new set of dentures (and several other luxuries of the modern world), saying ""This thing that's happening is bigger than you. It's a question of how you survive it. Survival of the fittest."" Mike leaves, hiking for home.Some time later as the first snow begins to fall, Tyler goes to a high point at the base and plays the wolf call on his bassoon, bringing in other wolves in George and Angeline's pack. The pups are quickly absorbed into the pack, and will live to fight another day. Tyler reflects sadly on his time here, and how he may have helped bring the modern world to this place. The narration implies that Tyler will eventually return to civilization and recover from his experiences here. In the final scene, Ootek returns, and he and Tyler break camp and trek across the fall tundra, enjoying each other's company, along with the words of an Inuit song sung by Tyler:""I think over again my small adventures, my fears.
Those small ones that seemed so big.
For all the vital things I had to get and to reach.
And yet there is only one great thing, the only thing:
To live to see the great day that dawns and the light that fills the world."""
Twilight Zone: The Movie,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086491/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four horror and science fiction segments, directed by four famous directors, each of them being a new version of a classic story fromRod Serling's landmark television series. Prologue: a driver has a big surprise with his passenger. Segment 1 (""Time Out""): a bigot hates Jews, Black and Asians. One day he will live in World War II, be hunted down by the KKK and get attacked in the Vietnam War and feel the effects of his hatred. Segment 2 (""Kick the Can""): In a nursing home, the elder inhabitants learn that their minds can keep them young. Segment 3 (""It's a Good Life""): a traveler hits a boy in a bicycle with her car and takes the boy home. Soon she learns that the powerful boy brought her home indeed. Segment 4 (""Nightmare at 20,000 feet""): a writer is scared to fly and soon he sees a monstrous creature destroying the airplane engines during a stormy night.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Four directors collaborated to remake three episodes of the popular television series 'The Twilight Zone' plus an original story for this movie. The episodes are updated slightly and in color (the television show was in black-and-white), but very true to the originals, where eerie and disturbing situations gradually spin out of control.—Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> Four horror/science-fiction segments directed by four of Hollywood's famous directors based on TV's most popular anthology series, bookended by a funny and scary prologue and epilogue. In the first story (a vague remake of the Twilight Zone episode ""A Quality of Mercy""), a loud-mouthed bigoted businessman with an intense hatred for Jews, blacks, and Asians, gets the tables turned on him when he walks out a bar and is inexplicably transported back in time to being pursued by Nazis in 1940's France, then as an African-American at a KKK rally in the 1950s Deep South, and as a Vietnamese in 1960s Vietnam. In the second story (a remake of ""Kick the Can""), an old man arrives at a retirement home and makes the wishes of the residents come true when he magically transforms them into youthful incarnations of their days gone by. In the third story (a remake of ""It's a Good Life""), a young woman on the road gives a ride to a mysterious 10-year-old boy to his house and ends up trapped with other people in an alternate reality created by the boy's imagination. The fourth story (a remake of ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"") features a passenger on an airline who sees, but cannot convince anyone of, a mysterious creature on the wing of the airplane trying to sabotage the aircraft.—Matthew Patay PrologueThe film starts with two men in a car, a driver (Albert Brooks) and his passenger (Dan Aykroyd), driving on a rural two-lane road very late at night, singing along to Creedence Clearwater Revival's cover of ""Midnight Special"" on a cassette, which then breaks. (Note: they never address each other by name and it is thus never explained if the two men are best friends, or having just met, or if the passenger is a hitchhiker or so on). The pair make a game between themselves about TV theme songs, then the conversation turns to what scares them. They begin to talk about their favorite episodes of The Twilight Zone and how weird and scary some of the episodes were. Out of the blue, the passenger then asks the driver, ""Do you want to see something really scary?"" The driver reluctantly pulls the car over. His friend turns his head away for a few seconds, then turns around, having pulled off a false mask off his face... becoming a demonic creature. The creature then fatally attacks the driver.The opening scene then cuts to outside the car as the familiar Twilight Zone opening theme music and monologue begin, spoken by narrator Burgess Meredith, a veteran of the original TV series.""You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sound. A dimension of sight. A dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into... The Twilight Zone.""First segment (""Time Out"")""You're about to meet an angry man: Mr. William Connor, who carries on his shoulder a chip the size of the national debt. This is a sour man, a lonely man, who's tired of waiting for the breaks that come to others, but never to him. Mr. William Connor, whose own blind hatred is about to catapult him into the darkest corner of the Twilight Zone.""The only original segment, directed by John Landis. It is loosely based on two original Twilight Zone episodes: ""A Quality of Mercy"" and ""Deaths-Head Revisited"". Bill Conner (Vic Morrow) is an outspoken bigot who is bitter after being passed over for a promotion. Drinking in a bar after work with his friends, Bill makes prejudiced remarks and racial slurs towards Jews, blacks and Asians, attracting the attention of a group of black men sitting near them who, of course, strongly resent his racist comments. Bill leaves the bar very angry.When he walks outside, the supernatural element of this story really begins. Bill finds that he is not in the parking lot. Instead, Bill inexplicably finds himself in Vichy France during World War II. He is spotted by a pair of SS officers patrolling the streets, who see him as a Jewish man. After a chase around the city, in which Bill is shot in his left arm by one of the German officers, Bill attempts to hide in an apartment, but the French woman quickly betrays him by shouting a warning to the German soldiers patrolling the streets. Bill climbs out on a ledge of the building, in trying to escape and finds himself trapped. While the two German officers take pot shots at him standing along the narrow ledge, Bill slips falls off the ledge and suddenly lands on soft earth ground.Bill discovers that he has time traveled to the rural South during the 1950s, where the Ku Klux Klan sees him as an African American whom they are about to lynch. Bill is scared and confused and vehemently tries to tell them he's white. After kicking one KKK member against the burning cross and setting him on fire, Bill breaks free and tries to escape (while still hampered by his bullet wound). While trying to escape the Ku Klux Klan members, he dives into a nearby pond and time travels into the Vietnam War, where he is a Vietnamese man nearly blown to bits by U.S. soldiers.(It is clearly implied at this point that by evil or divine intervention, Bill has become the selected nationalities of the people against whom he was always prejudiced.)The grenade thrown by the soldiers blasts him back to Vichy France, where he is captured by the same two Nazi officers chasing him and put into an enclosed railroad freight car, along with other Jewish Holocaust prisoners, with no possibility of redemption or rescue. Here the segment suddenly ends with the final shot showing Bill futilely screaming for help to his friends from the bar that only he can see as the train pulls away, presumably to a concentration camp or death camp. (Note: Vic Morrow died in a freak accident during filming, so an additional pall hangs over this whole story.)Second segment (""Kick the Can"")""It is sometimes said that where there is no hope, there is no life. Case in point: the residents of Sunnyvale Rest Home, where hope is just a memory. But hope just checked into Sunnyvale, disguised as an elderly optimist, who carries his magic in a shiny tin can.""The second segment is directed by Steven Spielberg and is a remake of the episode ""Kick the Can."" Mr. Bloom (Scatman Crothers) is an old man who has just moved into his new home at Sunnyvale Retirement Home. Upon his arrival, he sits around kindly and smiles as he listens to the other elders reminisce about the joys they experienced in their days as youths. Mr. Bloom implies to them just because they're old doesn't mean they cannot enjoy life anymore and that feeling young and active has to do with your attitude not your age. He tells them that later that night, he will wake them and that they can join him in a game of ""kick the can"". All agree; however, a grumpy man named Leo Conroy who is fairly skeptical in his outlook on life disagrees, saying that now that they are all old they cannot engage in physical activity and play the games they once did as children.That night, Mr. Bloom gathers the rest of the optimistic residents outside and plays a game of kick the can. They are all ultimately transformed back into child versions of themselves. Although they are extremely ecstatic to be young again and engage in the activities they once enjoyed so long ago, they also realize that being young again means you not only experience the good aspects of life again but also the bad. They request to be old again, which Mr. Bloom grants to them. Leo Conroy witnesses one resident that still remains young and says that he wants to go with him before the boy runs off. Conroy realizes that he does not have to stop enjoying life because of his old age.The segment ends with Mr. Bloom leaving Sunnyvale Retirement Home to move into another retirement home in another town (which leaves the audience to presume that he might be a good magical being who repeats the process eternally), and Conroy is outside the Sunnyvale home happily kicking a can around the backyard, for he has learned being young at heart is what really matters.Third segment (""It's a Good Life"")""Portrait of a woman in transit: Helen Foley, age 27. Occupation: schoolteacher. Up until now, the pattern of her life has been one of unrelenting sameness, waiting for something different to happen. Helen Foley doesn't know it yet, but her waiting has just ended.""The third segment is directed by Joe Dante and is a loose remake of the episode ""It's a Good Life"". Helen Foley (Kathleen Quinlan) is a mild-mannered school teacher who is traveling to her new job across the country. While visiting a rural bar/diner for directions from the owner Walter (Dick Miller), she witnesses a young boy (Jeremy Licht) playing a video game and then being accosted by a group of rowdy drunks for ""accidentally"" turning off the TV they were watching. Soon after, Helen decides to leave. Not paying attention, she backs into the boy with her car in the parking lot, damaging his bike. Helen offers the boy, Anthony, a ride home.They eventually get to Anthony's house, which is an immense home in the country. When Helen arrives, she meets some people whom Anthony tells her are his family, his Uncle Walt (Kevin McCarthy) and his sister Ethel (Nancy Cartwright). Also included in the family are Anthony's parents. Helen notices that the family seems extremely apprehensive, though she dismisses it. Anthony shows Helen around the house, including his sister's room; Anthony tells Helen that the girl is his ""other"" sister Sara (Cherie Currie), who got involved in an accident. The camera pans down and the audience view that the girl has no mouth, unbeknownst to Helen.The family have dinner, which, as Helen realizes, is a meal made up of Anthony's favorite foods; mainly fast food, including a burger with peanut butter. During dinner, Ethel shouts at Anthony and her plate smashes on the ground, with no explanation. After satisfying her promise of taking Anthony home, Helen attempts to leave; it is at this point that Helen discovers Anthony possesses unexplained supernatural powers that allow him to do practically anything he desires by wishing whatever he wants, including making cartoon characters appear in real life and making people disappear.Helen asks to leave, but Anthony insists that she see Uncle Walt's ""act"". Uncle Walt is unsure as to what to do with the top hat that Anthony provides, and reluctantly pulls a white rabbit out of the hat. The family are relieved and applaud, only to see the rabbit become a demonic rabbit-monster before disappearing again. The people finally inform her they aren't his real family and that they were brought to the house under false pretense by Anthony, as she was. They also explain that they cannot leave for Anthony has imprisoned them there in his own fantasy world that he created out of his mind. Helen finds a note on the floor that a family member has left, reading, ""Help us! Anthony is a Monster!"". The note is shown to be from Ethel after a short investigation, and Anthony, using his mental powers, sends Ethel into the television set where she is killed by a large, frightening, somewhat dragon-like cartoon character.After the ""family"" has angered Anthony, he instantly makes them and the house disappear, leaving himself and Helen in a limbo-like state surrounded by literal nothingness. Helen promises Anthony that she will be his true friend if he agrees not to abuse his power anymore. Anthony agrees to use his powers for good. He produces Helen's car and he and Helen ride off together to her new home, surrounded by bright meadows filled with flowers.Fourth segment (""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"")""What you're looking at could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare. It isn't. It's the beginning. Introducing Mr. John Valentine, air traveler. His destination: the Twilight Zone.""The fourth segment is directed by George Miller and is a remake of the episode ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"". John Valentine (John Lithgow) is a nervous and stressed-out airline passenger on a flight to Los Angeles. The story begins with flight attendants attempting to coax Mr. Valentine from the lavatory as he tries to recover from what seems to be a panic attack. Although not mentioned during the segment, it is most likely that Mr. Valentine is suffering from severe aviatophobia. He is repeatedly assured by the flight attendants that everything is going to be all right, but his nerves and antics disturb the surrounding passengers.As Mr. Valentine takes his seat, he notices a hideous gremlin-like creature on the wing of the plane and begins to spiral into severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, losing more control each time he sees it do something new. Valentine finally snaps, grabs a hand gun from another passenger, an air marshal, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the pressurized cabin), and begins firing at the creature. This only serves to catch the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and promptly destroys the gun. After a tense moment, in which they notice that the plane is landing, the gremlin grabs Valentine's face, then simply scolds him by wagging its finger in a ""no, no"" manner. The creature leaps into the sky and flies away as the airplane begins to make an emergency landing.As the delirious and incoherent Valentine is wrapped in a straitjacket and carried off in an ambulance, the police, crew, and passengers begin to discuss the incident, writing off Valentine as insane. The aircraft maintenance crew soon arrives however, and everyone gathers to examine the massive amounts of unexplained damage to the plane's engines.Epilogue...Valentine is in an ambulance going to a hospital when the driver (played by Dan Aykroyd, from the opening) starts playing Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Midnight Special"". The ambulance driver turns around and says, ""Heard you had a big scare up there, huh? Wanna see something really scary?"" The film then ends as the scene fades out to a starry night sky along with Rod Serling's opening monologue from the first season of The Twilight Zone.""There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone."""

High Road to China,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085678/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During WW1, an alcoholic American biplane pilot is hired by the spoiled daughter of an industrialist to find her father who disappeared in Asia. A biplane pilot is saddled with a spoiled industrialist's daughter on a search for her missing father through Asia that eventually involves them in a struggle against a Chinese warlord.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In a European hotel of the 1920s, a man returns to his room while being shadowed by another man. Before the second man can kill the first, he is shot. The man who does the shooting is Charlie, personal chaperon to Eve Tozer, a rich socialite who is heir to her father's fortune. Charlie has found out that Eve's father's business partner, Bentik, has moved to have her father, who has been missing for years, declared legally dead so he can seize all his assets, leaving Eve broke. Eve resolves to find her father.Eve is unsuccessful at first in finding someone to fly her to the far reaches of Asia, where her father was last rumored to have gone. She is eventually recommended to a local pilot, Patrick O'Malley, who is a former World War I flying ace. He is also a drunk. When Eve arrives at his airfield, she finds he has two biplanes, one named Dorothy, the other, Lillian (after acting sisters Dorothy and Lillian Gish). O'Malley initially turns down Eve's request, despite her generous offer of money. However, unpredictably, Eve herself is an accomplished pilot, which she proves to O'Malley very quickly by taking him on a rigorous flight in one of his planes. O'Malley accepts her offer and tells his mechanic, Struts, to mount Lewis-type machine guns on both planes since they'll be flying into hostile territory.As Eve prepares for her trip, and she and Charlie walk down a crowded street, they are attacked by assassins sent by Bentik. Eve escapes but Charlie is killed while seeing she gets away safely. Eve goes immediately to O'Malley's airfield, followed by Bentik's people. She, O'Malley, and Struts manage to escape the thugs sent after Eve and they fly east.At the end of their journey's first leg is a British airbase in Iraq. That night, O'Malley and Eve go to the officer's club, where O'Malley quickly becomes inebriated. O'Malley is asked about his war record and though he has many victories to speak of, he becomes somber, talking about flying against young, highly inexperienced pilots, who were easy ""kills"". When Eve tells him they should go to bed early, O'Malley becomes quite rude. The next morning O'Malley is quite hung over, however, they leave on schedule.The next leg of their journey brings them to a tribal camp in Afghanistan. The camp's leader, the Sulehman Khan, welcomes them, but warns that Eve must be compliant with their laws concerning women, who are treated as subservient. Later, at a banquet, when Eve asks the Khan if he knows her father's whereabouts, he tells her he is dead. However, the Khan has other plans; he wants O'Malley to use one of his planes to drop bombs on a nearby British camp. The Khan's nephew will fly with O'Malley, armed with a pistol in case O'Malley tries to fly off. The Khan also plans to hold Eve and Struts hostage until O'Malley returns. That night, they are met by an enslaved Nepalese woman, Alessa, who says she will help them escape. She also knows that Eve's father was indeed at the Khan's camp and escaped to her village in the Himalayas. Eve and O'Malley promise to take Alessa home.The next morning, O'Malley takes the Khan's son, with the explosives, into the air on the mission. Once in the air, having not told the Khan's nephew to fasten his lap belt, O'Malley suddenly inverts the plane, dropping the man on the Khan's camp. O'Malley creates a diversion by dropping bombs on the camp while Eve, Struts and Alessa successfully escape in the other plane.The group arrives in Nepal. When they arrive, Eve, quite exhausted, asks if her father is still there. He is not, and Eve faints. While she suffers from fever and delirium, O'Malley stays with her until she is well several days later. Meanwhile, Bentik learns of his assassins' failure and hires a German flying ace, Von Hess, to track down O'Malley and eliminate him. The next morning, in the midst of an argument (Eve mistakenly believes that O'Malley took advantage of her while she was ill), Von Hess attacks the village, destroying one of O'Malley's planes. O'Malley quickly flies into combat and downs Von Hess after a brief dogfight. Upon landing, O'Malley asks Eve to tell him the truth. Eve tells him that Bentik may have sent the man to kill them. O'Malley is flustered, but agrees to continue. The two talk to the village's shaman, who tells them that Eve's father has gone to the Chinese province of Sinkiang.Eve and O'Malley leave Struts behind and make the long flight to Sinkiang. In a remote village, they finally find her father, Bradley, who is working with the villagers to defeat a local warlord, General Wong. While Eve settles in, Tozer, while giving the pilot a tour of his defenses, asks O'Malley why they came so far just to find him. O'Malley tells him about Bentik's plans. Tozer laughs, saying that before he left, he arranged for Eve's financial future to be legally bound and that Bentik presents little threat. O'Malley plans to leave with Eve the next day for Hong Kong to file against Bentik in a British court. Eve refuses to leave, saying she wants to stay and help her father. O'Malley says she's crazy and she seems convinced to leave.The next morning, Wong begins his attack, which Tozer is well prepared for, having mined the valley around his fortress. He gains a special advantage when Eve suddenly appears, flying O'Malley's plane, dropping grenades on enemy positions. She takes out a large cannon, but is hit by machine-gun fire and crashes. O'Malley rides out on horseback to find her. Eve is alive and uninjured, but a nearby enemy squad finds them. While O'Malley fights them off, Tozer begins setting off the mines in the valley, quickly winning the battle and killing Wong in the process. The soldiers retreat and O'Malley and Eve share a romantic moment."
The Outsiders,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086066/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a small Oklahoma town in 1964, the rivalry between two gangs, the poor Greasers and the rich Socs, heats up when one gang member accidentally kills a member of the other. It is 1965, and Tulsa, Oklahoma is divided in two along social lines. The youths of each side form gangs in line with these two camps: the working class Greasers and the wealthier South Side gang, the Socs. The two sides use any opportunity to niggle each other and whenever they meet, there is friction. Then one night, a gang of Socs attack two Greasers with a knife. This sets off a chain of events.—grantss Under everyone's noses, war is brewing in 1960s Tulsa, Oklahoma. On the one hand, the Greasers--tough, working-class rebels from the other side of the tracks--dream of a better world. On the other hand, the Socials, or Socs--privileged, bored-to-death college boys--have got it all figured out. And then, as tempers flare and a sinister undercurrent of simmering enmity invites violence, someone knifes a cocky Soc. As a result, two Greasers go on the lam. Now, the already tenuous truce is at stake; only a once-and-for-all, winner-take-all rumble between the two teen gangs can sort out the men from the boys. But when you're sixteen, there are so many things you haven't seen or done yet. What difference will it make if either of them wins?—Nick Riganas The year is 1964. There are 2 gangs divided the social class. One gang is the Greasers and the other is the Socs. Both hate each other and jump each other every now and then. One night though, things go too far and Ponyboy and Johnny are jumped. The results of the jumping cause a chain of events.—Ethangamer579 The film opens with Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) sitting at his desk in his room, writing. He talks about walking home from the movies one night. As he is bouncing and messing with a ball, he recites parts of the movie that he's just seen when a group of guys pull up in a red Corvair. They start to call him a greaser because he has greasy hair, and he tries to evade them. They're the Socials, clean-cut teens dressed in Varsity letter jackets and chinos, also known as the rich kids or the South Side Socs. The Socs stop, get out, and attack Pony, knocking him to the ground as he struggles. The soc on top of Pony puts his knees on Pony's elbows, asking, ""How would you like that haircut to begin just below the neck?"" Ponyboy struggles but is unable to unpin himself. As the socs try and shut him up, the knife accidentally slips and cuts his head slightly. Hearing his screams, Pony's older brothers, Darrel (Patrick Swayze) and Sodapop (Rob Lowe) and the rest of their gang, Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio), Dallas Winston (Matt Dillion), Steve Randall (Tom Cruise), and Two-Bit Matthews (Emilio Estevez) come to his rescue, chasing off the Socs. Darrel, Sodapop, and Ponyboy lost their parents in a car crash. Darrel, a high school grad with a job, acts as the father figure. Soda is a dropout who works at a gas station. The three are allowed to live together without parental supervision as long as they stay out of trouble. Pony is still in high school at Darry's insistence and is actually a good student, earning good grades. However, Pony is often absent-minded, getting into trouble when he doesn't let his older brothers know where he is after dark and other small slips. Darry is very protective of his two younger brothers, more so with Pony, since they are all still reeling from the trauma of losing their parents.Dallas, Johnny, and Ponyboy go to a drive-in movie and sit in the bleachers. Cherry (Diane Lane) quarrels with her Soc date and leaves his car, going to sit in front of the greasers with her friend . Dallas tries to chat her up but Cherry seems to connect more with Ponyboy and Johnny. Dallas finally says something offensive and Cherry, unafraid of his tough-guy attitude, tells him to shut his mouth. When Dallas reaches for her, Johnny stops him, being the only member of the group able to do so. Spurned, Dallas stalks off. Pony goes with Cherry to the concession stand. While waiting in line, they talk about their respective friends. Pony's view is that he and his friends are persecuted by the Socs because they're poor, dress differently and are often considered delinquents. Cherry counters, saying that her group has their own problems, ones that the greasers couldn't even imagine. Back at their seats, Two-Bit joins the group and after the movie ends, the three boys and two girls walk together chatting. Cherry's boyfriend, Bob, stops in his car nearby. He's drunk and harshly admonishes her for hanging out with the greasers. Two-Bit immediately pulls out the butterfly knife he carries and smashes the end off a bottle to use as a weapon. To avoid a violent fight, Cherry reluctantly goes with Bob.While they walk past Johnny's house, they hear Johnny's parents having a violent fight. Johnny decides he's going to sleep out in the vacant lot near his house until his parents stop fighting. When he arrives home, Ponyboy is harshly reprimanded by Darry for staying out so late. When his brother tries to stop the argument, Darry pushes Pony a bit too hard, spilling him to the floor. Pony runs out of the house despite Darry's attempts to apologize and he finds Johnny in the vacant lot. Still very much upset, Pony gets Johnny to walk to the local park with him.Not long after, the Socs find Ponyboy and Johnny in the park, still angry about the greasers trying to pick up Cherry and her friend. They mock both Pony and Johnny for having long, greasy hair and Pony throws an insult back. The Socs are further provoked when Pony spits at them and tries to run, making it as far as the park's fountain. The Socs knock Johnny to the ground and dunk Ponyboy's head in the water, nearly drowning him. Johnny pulls out a switchblade to stop them. Bob is left dead and everyone flees. Johnny, unusually calm only a few minutes after he kills Bob, decides that he and Pony should find Dallas, who will be able to help them in their predicament. They go to a house where Dallas had been partying with an old friend (a cameo by singer Tom Waits) and talk to him about hiding out. Dallas gives them instructions to board a train to a small village called Windrixville where they can hide out in an abandoned church. Johnny and Ponyboy hop a freight train and make their way, break into the church, and fall asleep. The next morning Johnny comes back with bologna and bread, cigarettes, a paperback copy of ""Gone With the Wind"" and, oddly, a bottle of peroxide. Pony is puzzled by the last item until Johnny tells him that they should cut their hair and dye Pony's blonde so they can't fit the descriptions the police will have for them. Johnny also mentions that if they have to appear before a judge, that the judge will order them to get their hair cut anyway. They cut their hair with Johnny's switchblade and Ponyboy dyes his blond. The two hide out in the church for several days, waiting for word from Dallas. The two spend several days playing cards, betting with cigarettes, Pony reads ""Gone With the Wind"" to Johnny, and they try to trap a rabbit. One morning, Pony wakes up early and sees the valley below the church in the sunrise, admiring its beauty. He recites a Robert Frost poem, ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"" that Johnny takes to heart.A few days later Dallas arrives and takes them out to eat. He tells Ponyboy about how the police are looking for Bob's killer, even hauling Dallas himself in for questioning. Soda and Darry are both worried about Pony's disappearance but Dallas has assured them that the two are safe.Johnny wants to turn himself in as it sounds like they can claim self-defense, but Dallas tries to discourage him, warning him of what can happen if Johnny gets jail time. On returning to the church, they find it burning and a group of young kids milling about with two adults and a school bus. The woman exclaims some kids are trapped inside. Johnny and Ponyboy feel responsible, thinking that one of them must've dropped a lit cigarette that sparked the fire. Over Dallas' harsh objection, they enter to rescue the kids, Dallas reluctantly following. They find the kids in a back room and carry them to safety, Dallas helping out. Suddenly the roof collapses and Johnny is badly burnt and his back is broken. Dallas pulls both of them to safety. EMS finally arrives and takes them back to their hometown and the hospital. The boys are all hailed as heroes, and Ponyboy is tearfully reunited with Darrel and Sodapop.The Socs and Greasers plan a big rumble to settle things after the death of Bob, and Cherry acts as the go-between: No knives or other weapons; fighting will only be hand-to-hand. Two-Bit and Pony go to the hospital to visit Dallas and Johnny. Johnny is suffering from horrible burns and is in traction, laying on his chest, seemingly paralyzed. The visit is very emotional and Johnny becomes very upset when a nurse tells him that his mother has come to visit. He doesn't want to see her, as he feels she doesn't care about him. He orders the nurse (a cameo by the novel's author, SE Hinton) to send her away, and faints. Pony and Two-Bit leave, shaken by the encounter. When they visit Dallas, he is arguing with a nurse. Dallas asks about Johnny and they tell him the outcome doesn't look promising. Dallas is desperate to join the big rumble and asks Two-Bit for his knife, talking about revenge for Johnny's sake.On the night of the rumble, despite signs of exhaustion, Ponyboy wants to go. Darrell reluctantly lets him participate, telling him and Soda to run if cops arrive. The Socs arrive and the big rumble gets underway in a heavy rainstorm as the groups pair off and start slugging. Both sides get their licks in but after a while the Socs retreat, the Greasers whooping with delight at their victory. Just before the first punch is thrown, Dallas arrives, having left the hospital. When the fight ends, Dallas grabs Pony and they drive to the hospital to see Johnny, who is weaker than ever. On the way, Dallas tells Pony to stay tough and nothing will ever faze him. When they arrive, Dallas tells Johnny that the Socs have been driven out of their territory for good. Johnny seems not to care and tells Pony to ""stay gold"". Johnny dies and Dallas becomes incredibly upset, dry-firing a pistol at a doctor and babbling madly before he runs off. Pony heads home to find Darrell and the rest of the gang nursing their wounds. He tells them that Johnny died and Dallas tore off in a fury. While Pony worries that Dallas will do something crazy, Dallas holds up a convenience store and is shot and wounded. He calls Pony's house, asking for a place to hide from the police. The cops chase him and shoot him when he waves the unloaded gun at them. The police open fire and his friends arrive just as he dies; his last word is ""Pony"". Pony faints from exhaustion.At the trial Cherry gives her testimony and Ponyboy is declared not guilty. Back at school Ponyboy is now neatly dressed and coiffed; Cherry ignores him and a teacher gives him an extension to finish his writing assignment.At home Darrel rides Ponyboy as Sodapop runs off into the night. The three brothers reunite and Sodapop tells Darrel to stop being so hard on Ponyboy, the three only have each other and they all need to get along. They have a group hug and return home.At home at his desk, Ponyboy opens the paperback copy of Gone With the Wind that they'd bought for Johnny and finds a note from his friend. Johnny tells him he thinks the Robert Frost poem Pony had recited while they watched the sunrise was telling them both to enjoy their youth. Pony opens his composition class notebook and begins to write his story, starting with the moment he left the movie theater: ""When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I only had two things on my mind: Paul Newman, and a ride home"", the first line from Hinton's novel."

My Tutor,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085980/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A rich father hires a tutor for his son. The son is a horny teenager and the tutor is a gorgeous blonde. Complications ensue. High school senior Bobby Chrystal fails his French class, which will block him from entering Yale. His rich, authoritarian father hires an attractive 29-year-old to tutor Bobby over the summer and help him pass a make-up exam. While Bobby's friends lead him away into strange excursions aimed at losing their virginities, Bobby finds all the extracurricular activities he needs with his new tutor.—statmanjeff Bobby Chrystal couldn't care less about French or Yale; however, when he fails miserably at his French finals, his former-Yale-student father decides to take drastic measures. Now, to help Bobby score at least 85% in the make-up examination, Mr Chrystal enlists the help of the expert and voluptuous live-in tutor, Terry Green--every teenager's fantasy. Suddenly, as Bobby becomes Terry's favourite pupil, he is inspired to learn the language of love. However, is Bobby's interest purely academic?—Nick Riganas The movie opens with scenes of an all-women's aerobics class juxtaposed with a classroom of students taking an examination. The movie's two protagonists are featured in these scenes, with Terry Green (Caren Kaye) participating in the aerobics and Bobby Chrystal (Matt Lattanzi) taking, not very well it turns out, his last high school final, in French.At first, Bobby's main goal for the summer before college appears to be losing his virginity, if not with his unrequited high school crush, Bonnie (Amber Denyse Austin) who dates a college student, then with any takers. Soon, though, the poor results of the French final are in, and Bobby must take a make-up examination and score at least a B (85%) in order to retain his acceptance at his father's alma mater, Yale University. Bobby's father, Mr. Chrystal (Kevin McCarthy), hires Terry, a skilled 30-year-old French tutor, to live in the Chrystal home during the summer and work with Bobby on passing his exam. In addition to her normal compensation, Mr. Chrystal offers to give Terry a bonus payment of $10,000 should Bobby pass. Terry agrees.Terry and Bobby begin working together but Bobby's lack of interest in both French and Yale soon become apparent. His real goal, he tells Terry, is to attend UCLA and study his true passion, astronomy. Terry is sympathetic but reminds Bobby that wherever he ends up going to college, he will need to pass his French final. With Terry's help, Bobby begins to make some progress.At night, after she thinks everyone in the Chrystal home is asleep, Terry uses the family's pool to skinny dip. However, Bobby sees her one night and begins watching her regularly (especially after several unsuccessful attempts by his friends and him to have sex with women in increasingly bizarre situations). After one such evening, Bobby follows Terry back to her room, only to have her sneak up behind him and surprise him. Terry gently admonishes Bobby for spying on her but it is clear that they have a mutual attraction. Terry, however, has begun seeing a former boyfriend again, much to Bobby's displeasure.After yet another evening out with his friends, Bobby returns home to find an upset Terry, who had earlier discovered her boyfriend again cheating on her. They talk briefly and Terry later heads to the pool for her regular swim. Once she completes her lap she sees Bobby waiting for her at the end of the pool. Terry reacts by pulling Bobby into the pool with her and kissing him. Returning to Terry's room together, the two have sex and thus starting an intence love affair. At dawn, Bobby manages to sneak back to his own bedroom where he makes it seem to his father that he has been studying all night.The affair between Bobby and Terry progresses until the summer's end approaches and he has to take his French examination. Despite Terry's attempts to keep their relationship casual, Bobby has developed serious feelings for Terry and resists her insistence that the affair end once he takes his exam.

The Right Stuff,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086197/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The U.S. space program's development from the breaking of the sound barrier to selection of the Mercury 7 astronauts, from a group of test pilots with a more seat-of-the-pants approach than the program's more cautious engineers preferred. Tom Wolfe's book on the history of the U.S. Space program reads like a novel, and the film has that same fictional quality. It covers the breaking of the sound barrier byChuck Yeagerto the Mercury 7 astronauts, showing that no one had a clue how to run a space program or how to select people to be in it. Thrilling, funny, charming and electrifying all at once.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The first seven Mercury astronauts: we go behind the prepackaged, unblemished saints we knew through the media to find imperfect human beings who were actually even more heroic. The astronauts are heroes, no doubt about it. As space pioneerChuck Yeagerbitterly points out, these men all knew the risks they were taking as they rode their primitive capsules into space. They knew they were powered by rockets that could explode them into the tiniest of atoms. There were the fierce fires of re-entry that could reduce them to cinders, as well as the possibility of no re-entry, leaving them to perish miserably in their orbits. Yet these men eagerly took those risks. They were made of the right stuff.—alfiehitchie The story of the beginnings of the US space program and the first seven Mercury astronauts. The space began whenChuck Yeagerbroke the sound barrier. It was after the Soviets successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1959, that the U.S. redoubled its efforts to catch up. After rigorous testing, 7 pilots were selected for the program. They instantly became the modern day equivalent of rock stars, appearing on television and having articles written about them in Life magazine. The work was serious however and dangerous, given the poor record the missile designers faced with multiple failures before finally getting a successful launch. There is a good deal of rivalry among the USA's first astronauts, some quite serious as ambitions and different values come into play.—garykmcd The post-WWII period in the US is a time of grandeur and hope, wanting to do things bigger and better than had ever been done before. Within the military, this attitude applies largely to flight, where there is a continual race not only to fly faster and higher, but do it first and especially before the Soviets. The men that are going to achieve these feats are the ones with the ""right stuff"". One of those initial targets is to break the sound barrier - Mach 1 - with pilots in the newly commissioned US Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California primarily those attempting the feat, many who will die in the process. But with what is happening in the Soviet Union will accelerate the American space program, which will largely usurp the political and public consciousness on those aeronautic feats. However, many within the space program and many pilots downgrade the importance of ""man behind the wheel"" in getting into space. Regardless, many pilots apply for the seven positions within the first American space program - Mercury - the seven chosen who do whatever they can to make flying expertise an important aspect of the job. In all these situations, the support from the women behind the men is demonstrated, they who have the continual fact of one in four not making it back from a flight in the front of their minds. The motivations of the individuals comprising the pilots, the astronauts and the wives are also shown.—Huggo In 1947, a group of determined men gathered at a remote Air Force base in the high desert of California. Their goal was to break the sound barrier by using a small rocket-powered test plane called the X-1. The only problem was that others had tried before, and not all had survived. Some thought of the sound barrier as a ""demon that lived in the sky"", waiting to destroy any who dared confront it.Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), a young wartime ace with a wild reputation, volunteers to fly the X-1, and spends the night before his flight at the local bar. After a few drinks, he and his wife go galloping off on their horses through the twilight, but a tree branch catches Yeager across the chest, knocking him off the horse and cracking a few ribs. Hiding his injury from the flight crew the next morning, Yeager climbs painfully into the plane and prepares to confront the sound barrier ""demon"".The little X-1 is carried aloft by a large B-29 bomber, then at the right altitude, is dropped free. Yeager ignites the rocket engine and quickly zooms up into the sky, going faster and faster, closing in on the deadly Mach-1 mark. The plane begins to vibrate, then shake, with Yeager fighting the controls. Suddenly, there is a strange boom, heard by the crew waiting on the ground, and everyone fears that the sound barrier has claimed another life. A moment later, they are surprised to hear Yeager's calm voice crackle over the radio, ""Make a note here would you?"" This Mach-meter must be busted. It's jumped clear off the scale."" Amazed, then jubilant, they realize that Yeager has done it: The sound barrier had been broken. A reporter rushes to the nearest pay phone to report the event and is stopped by an Air Force officer who tells him the nature of the mission is top secret - they don't want the news to reach the Soviet Union.The desert airbase, now called Edwards, quickly becomes the center for all test and experimental aircraft in the U.S., and every hot-shot jet-jockey looking for a chance to become famous gravitates there. A few years pass, and one such pilot, Gordo Cooper (Dennis Quaid) can't wait to take a crack at becoming ""the best pilot anyone ever saw."" He finds Edwards already packed with others like himself, with Yeager still at the top of the pyramid.Unforeseen events halfway around the world change everything for these test pilots. The Communists launch Sputnik, history's first orbiting satellite, and suddenly everything is focused on the race for space. Looking for the first American astronauts, representatives from the newly formed NASA visit Edwards. Cooper sees a chance to stand out from the crowd and volunteers, along with his friends Gus Grissom (Fred Ward) and Deke Slayton (Scott Paulin). Other pilots, such as Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn) from the Navy, and John Glenn (Ed Harris) a Marine flyer, also answer the call.Tested to the limits of discomfort, pain and exhaustion, the astronaut candidates are slowly weeded out, leaving a mere seven pilots as the handpicked group that will lead America into space. Basking in their glory, they are stunned to hear that the Soviets have beaten them again, launching the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space. Chagrined, they must now play catch-up with the Russians, and Alan Shepard is chosen to be the first American astronaut.Before they can launch a human into space, NASA sends a chimpanzee as a test subject. The chimp returns to Earth safely but the astronauts are dismayed that an animal went first. They are further dismayed when a series of test rockets fail to launch, either collapsing on the launch pad or explode in mid-air. The astronauts also quarrel with Wernher von Braun and the other NASA engineers about the design of the space capsule (""space craft"") and whether or not it will have windows and a hatch with emergency bolts to escape if anything goes wrong. The scientists initially refuse to listen to the astronauts demands but relent when the men mention that funding can easily run out for space missions and that they'll spill everything to the press, who are kept waiting outside the hangar while the capsule is inspected.Shepard is strapped into his capsule early on the morning of the launch, he waits patiently while ground control works its way through an endless series of glitches. Shepard's flight was supposed to be a short 15-minute loft into space, and he's been waiting on the pad for hours. Feeling the call of nature, Shepard is forced to ""do it in the suit"", much to the embarrassment of ground control. However, once he's relieved himself, he demands that they get on with it and fire the rocket. ""I'm cooler than you are, so let's light this candle!"" Everyone holds their breath, and the button is pushed. Shepard's rocket ignites, and quickly climbs into the sky. Subjected to tremendous stress during the launch and then the fall back to Earth, he survives the flight and is picked up by the waiting helicopter. America has its first astronaut.Gus Grissom is next and his flight goes well, but during the recovery, the hatch on his capsule is unexpectedly blown off, and when the sea floods in, Grissom nearly drowns and the capsule is lost at the bottom of the Pacific. No one believes his claim that there was a fault in the system, and he's denied the hero's welcome afforded Shepard. The Russians make yet another bold move, placing a second man into orbit while the Americans struggle with short sub-orbital flights. Decisive action is needed, and John Glenn is chosen for the next American mission.An unreliable rocket, the Mercury Atlas, is chosen to launch Glenn into orbit, and the country watches as the risky flight progresses. Thankfully, Glenn's capsule makes it into orbit, and everyone draws a sigh of relief. Soon however, trouble develops, and there is a serious doubt that the capsule's heat shield will protect Glenn during re-entry. Without it, he'll be incinerated. Facing the fact that there's nothing he can do but try, Glenn fires his retros and begins to fall back through the atmosphere at 18,000 miles per hour. As the heat builds up around the capsule, his radio link to the ground is blanked out, and all they can do is wait. Minutes tick by as Glenn tears through the super-heated air. Amazingly, he survives, and American can finally claim they have at last matched the Russians in the space race.Back at Edwards, events have bypassed Chuck Yeager. No one cares about high-altitude flight or Mach-speed records now; everyone is talking about spacemen. In one more record-setting attempt, Yeager takes a specially modified F-104 Starfighter up in a dangerous, high-altitude flight. Zooming through the stratosphere once more, he pushes his plane to the limit, climbing higher and higher, pushed to a record altitude by the rocket in the tail. The sky around him grows dark as he approaches the edge of space.Suddenly the engine begins to stall. The air is too thin and the jet can't keep running at this height. The plane slows as alarm lights flash on the control panel. Yeager looks out at the dark sky around him, and for a moment he can see the stars twinkling just out of reach; he is almost there. But the plane lurches, and begins to fall. There's no control, no power, no way to recover. Yeager is in a deadly flat spin. Spiraling down faster and faster, Yeager struggles to get his craft under control, but as he nears the ground, he must either eject or crash. Pulling the ejection control, his seat is fired out of the doomed plane, but the small rocket in the ejection seat has ignited his flight suit, and he plummets through the clouds, trailing smoke as the flames burn up into his helmet.On the ground, the crash truck lumbers out over the flat desert toward the crashed plane. The recovery crew fully expects to find Yeager's smashed body in the wreckage, but something off in the distance catches their eye, and they turn toward it. As they draw closer, the shape becomes Yeager, his face badly burned, calmly and proudly walking towards them. He has survived once again.Intercut with Yeager's flight are scenes of the Mercury astronauts attending a huge Texas banquet thrown by Lyndon B. Johnson. The men watch a performance by fan dancer Sally Rand, and look at each other, knowing they're heroes to all Americans. Gordo Cooper remarks that he's achieved success as an astronaut having a good home, money, and a fine meal, and that he hasn't even been on a space mission yet. When asked who the greatest pilot he ever knew was, Gordo hesitates for a time, perhaps wanting to mention Chuck Yeager, and instead answers ""You're lookin' at him.""As the last of the Mercury-7 astronauts prepares for his flight into space, the ground controllers hear snoring over the microphone in the capsule. Gordo Cooper is finally getting his chance to prove he has ""the right stuff"", but first they have to wake him up. Laughing, they continue the countdown, and Cooper rides the rocket into space, setting records for the longest space flight to date, and proving, if only for a short time, that he is ""the greatest pilot anyone ever saw."" The narrator tells us that Cooper was the last astronaut to go into space alone."

But, who is this cocky new Arnie that has emerged from the ashes? Has Christine--the glossy metallic temptress--something to do with it, and the seemingly endless trail of warm blood in the peaceful town of Rockbridge?—Nick Riganas Highschool geek Arnie Cunningham falls in love with ""Christine"", a bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury which has seen much better days. Setting himself the task of restoring the car to its original condition, his friends notice that the car is not the only thing that is changing. Arnie seems to spend more and more time with his car. He's also developed a sort of cocky arrogance which does not seem like the real Arnie at all.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Arnie Cunningham is a typical high school nerd who is picked on, overruled by his parents, and has very few friends. Until he meets Christine, a run-down 1958 Plymouth Fury and buys her. Arnie learns that Christine has a thing for him and devotes his time to restoring her to mint condition. But overtime, Arnie begins to change and becomes disconnected with reality and his friends. Arnie's girlfriend Leigh and best friend Dennis find out that Christine's previous owner cared about nothing else when he bought her and find out that Arnie is becoming just like him.—Geoffrey A. Middleton {gamidd01@morehead-st.edu} It's 1958 in Detroit. We are inside a car factory where numerous Plymouth Fury's are being assembled. Among the rather plain-colored vehicles, one of them stands out: a bright-red one. During the process, this particular red car is being fussed about by one factory worker who has his hand injured when the vehicle's hood comes down on it. Another factory worker takes a seat inside the vehicle; he will be found dead afterwords.Present day, September 16, 1978 in Northern California. Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a meek teenager who spends his weekends playing Scrabble with his parents (Christine Belford and Richard Darnell), who still treat him as a child. Arnie and his best friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) are going to their school, as usual. Arnie is clumsy, and his black-rimmed glasses characterize him as being nerdy. Dennis is a football player, who still befriends Arnie and tries to stand up for him.During shop class, Arnie is bullied by several students led by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander). Dennis tries to stop the bullies, but he can't be all the time checking on weak Arnie. Today, Buddy stamps on Arnie's sack-lunch and also breaks his glasses. When both Arnie and Dennis tell the shop teacher that Buddy had a switchblade in his possession when he teased Arnie, it looks that the only consequence will be bad for Arnie, as Boddy announces he will take his own back pretty soon.Arnie and Dennis start their way back to their homes. Arnie notices a used Plymouth Fury with a placard announcing ""SOLD"". Supposedly, this is the same vehicle that we saw on the Detroit assembly line... only now it's dirty, gritty, broken, with pieces peeling off or falling apart. In spite of everything, Arnie falls in love with this car. He immediately wants to buy it. The owner, George LeBay, tells the story of the car: he inherited it from his dead brother, Roland. The current owner also tells Arnie that the car has a name: Christine.Arnie drives Dennis home in his new car. Once at home, Arnie's overprotective parents angrily start pestering him for having spent his money on a car without consulting them, and especially one in Christine's wrecked condition. Arnie angrily shouts back that throughout his life, they haven't allowed him to have something he truly wants, and that he is dead-set on keeping Christine. However, his parents refuse to have it parked in their driveway. Arnie decides to take it to a local junkyard garage run by an irritable middle-aged man named Will Darnell (Robert Prosky) for storage.Over the next several weeks, Arnie begins working on Christine whenever he has a bit of free time after school. He also starts to help Mr. Darnell around his garage. This was the first time when Arnie stood up to his parents. However, it's not only about being against parental control. Dennis also notices a subtle change in Arnie, as he seems to be more assertive. Weirdly enough, Arnie has stopped using his eye glasses.During a football game, Dennis is shocked to see Arnie arrive in Christine, now fully-restored into a shining beautiful red car, but also along for the ride is the new student, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). The sight of the two of them together causes Dennis to make a mistake on the field as he's tackled hard. This puts an end to Dennis' football career - and to his ambitions for the future-, so he ends up recuperating in hospital, surrounded by medical paraphernalia.Meanwhile, Arnie continues to date Leigh. One night, he takes her to see a film at the drive-in; and there, Leigh confesses to Arnie that she thinks he's moving too fast in their relationship. She also claims she feels unsettled when she is around Christine. During the movie, one of Christine's windshield wipers becomes stuck, and Arnie gets out to fix it. As he does so, Leigh chokes on a hamburger and immediately, the door latches lock themselves! Arnie tries to get back into the car unsuccessfully. Basically, Leigh has to save herself when she manages to unlock the passenger door, and a nearby viewer who saw her struggling performs the Heimlich maneuver on her.Arnie then drives Leigh home. At her doorstep, she tells him that she won't go anywhere in Christine again. There are weird things about the car, she says, like when only old songs can be reached through the radio aerial, but none of the local radio stations can be heard. Arnie then returns Christine to Darnell's garage.After Arnie's departure, Buddy Repperton and his thugs arrive, and they proceed to systematically destroy the car. Arnie sees the wreck done to Christine the following day and is shocked that all the work he had put into restoring the car has evaporated.Arnie suspects that Leigh was somehow responsible for the wreck. He is getting into trouble as home as well, as his temper is radically changed. His parents notice the acute change in him and they comment that they want the old Arnie to come back. The long Scrabble nights are over, and Arnie has one big row with his father. But more and more, Arnie can only think of one matter: he wants to restore Christine to its full beauty again.Next day, first thing he does is going to the salvage garage to re-start work on Christine. Determined, he looks for his tools. Turning his back on Christine, he hears the crinkling of metal behind him. Arnie looks at Christine startled, and he realizes that, part of her engine is now repaired as if by magic. Arnie doesn't look startled anymore, and he encourages Christine to restore herself in front of him. The car flicks her headlights on, and obediently, there is suddenly mayhem: pieces are moving to their original position, the hood dusts itself off, the aerial strengthens up, buttons and seats start mending themselves and end up being shiny as brand new. The living malevolent car has the power to regenerate.A more-determined Arnie goes back to high school life. Nobody dares to touch him now. At night, Christine comes to life by herself and she seeks out and gruesomely kills each gang member who took part in destroying her. He runs after them. Eventually, Christine arrives at a gas station, spilling gasoline, setting it on fire so that the building becomes debris and ashes. Christine catches fire herself, but that doesn't stop her, as she still goes after Buddy. He tries to run away the scene, terrified because he has seen an unexplainable thing happened. The following morning, Chrisitne becomes the quiet, shiny, brand-new red car of the cover painting.Christine also kills grumply Will Darnell, by the slow method of crushing him in the front seat against the steering wheel. Christine has to deform herself in order to do this, but the following morning, she is in perfect condition.Some weeks later in December, Dennis catches Leigh in high school between classes and he talks to her about Arnie and his car. Dennis and Arnie are not best pals anymore, and Leigh had realised that, in spite of not having broken up verbally with Arnie, there is no place in his life for her. Holidays approach, and New Year's Eve is close. Dennis and Leigh talk about the supernatural element in Christine, knowing that they can only talk to each other about that, as nobody else would believe them. They know they will have to kill Christine.Dennis decides to call on his old buddy at his home, but Leigh advises him to take caution. After she leaves, it's Arnie who calls on Dennis instead. Arnie arrives in Christine and invites Dennis over. Arnie drives Dennis to the former's. Dennis realises about Arnie's dazzled eyes, even before Arnie starts doing things he would have never done before, during his nerd phase: he drinks beer in Homer Simpson-quantities, he terrorizes other drivers and even copies the ""without-hands"" motorbike stunt. Dennis watches how Christine's mile counter moves backwards, having less miles instead of more. Arnie tires to explain to Dennis how wonderful, strong and fulfilled he feels when he is driving Christine; Arnie's words increasingly become those of a starry-eyed lover.When Dennis leaves Christine, he is more unsettled than ever. Dennis is determined that the nightmare has to stop. He thinks that killing Christine is the only way of returning Arnie to normal. Dennis and Leigh may be having a thing going on between them, but it also may be that each one is the only safe rock of the other. They are worried about Arnie, especially Dennis, who really misses his best friend. Next morning, Dennis goes to the school parking lot and scratches ""Darnell's Tonight"" into Christine's hood, and drives off with Leigh. They go to Darnell's scrapyard and they wait for Arnie and Christine inside a bulldozer. Night falls down, and Dennis devises a plan. He tells Leigh to wait in the office. The plan is that she will shut door on Christine after her arrival, trapping the vehicle inside the office.Leigh leaves to do so. While she is on her way there, the car's lights suddenly break the night: she was hiding under a pile of garbage. Christine drives towards Leigh trying to run over her, but crashes on to one of the office walls instead. Arnie gets ejected through Christine's windshield and is impaled on a shard of glass, fatally wounding him. Arnie is bloodied, but in his last breath, he just caresses Christine's front bumper for the last time. In his own way, he dies happy.Enraged, Christine attacks Leigh once again. Dennis drives the bulldozer and he fights Christine, who is playing  Pledging My Love  at top volume on her radio. Christine is still set on dealing with Leigh first, so she approaches her top speed to run over her. However, Dennis drives the bulldozer up on to the car's back, stopping her and crashing her. Leigh climbs in to the cab of the bulldozer and embraces Dennis. Meanwhile, Christine returns back to life and begins to heal herself over again. So, Dennis has to drive the bulldozer over Christine, crashing her onto a thin layer of metal and glass materials, until her headlights flicker and then go out for good. Dennis compacts the red car onto a cube.The ordeal is over.However, later on, within that scrape-yard cube, a metallic stick starts to slowly move and straighten up..."

Brett Camber (Billy Jacoby) is a young boy and a son of a mechanic, Joe, (Ed Lauter) whose only companion is a St. Bernard named ""Cujo."" While chasing a rabbit into a cave, Cujo is bitten by a bat with rabies and his behavior begins to change. While the dog begins to succumb to the disease, Brett and his mother leave for Connecticut to visit his mother's sister, using money from a lottery won by Mrs. Camber. When Donna and her young son, Tad (Danny Pintauro), drive out to the home where Cujo and the Cambers live, in order to fix Donna's car, the once-gentle Cujo, now driven mad by the disease, attack the Cambers' neighbor, Gary Parvier (Mills Watson). Gary engages the dog in a fight and drives it off briefly, retreating to his home. He tries to arm himself with a shotgun, but as he searches for the shells Cujo enters through a back door and attacks him again. A wild struggle follows in the front of Gary's house, and eventually he is overpowered and killed by Cujo. Joe Camber, after heading down to Gary's, looks for Gary but doesn't find him. He does find blood on the porch and goes inside - and discovers Gary's body on the floor, his throat torn open. Joe goes to call the police but Cujo suddenly enters the house, and Joe immediately recognizes that their once-beloved family pet is now rabid - and a dangerous menace. While trying to defend himself, Camber unwittingly backs himself into a corner and Cujo attacks & kills him too.When Donna & Tad reach the Camber house, their Ford Pinto car's alternator dies. They are ambushed by Cujo while still in their vehicle, sending Tad into a panic. Donna and Tad are trapped inside the Pinto while the massive dog waits outside, attacking repeatedly, all while Vic is out of town on a business trip. Donna's repeated attempts to start the car are in vain and the 200-lb St. Bernard charges the car with each attempt.Vic returns home to find his house trashed - the result of vandalism by Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone), the man Donna had the affair with. He calls the Sheriff and tells him that he suspects Kemp is also responsible for the disappearance of Donna and Tad, having called the home repeatedly but gotten no answer. The Sheriff puts an alert out for Kemp's vehicle and Kemp is soon picked up. While he admits to trashing the house, Kemp denies having even seen Donna and Tad. The Sheriff believes him and when informed by Vic that Donna was taking the car to Joe Camber's for repairs, goes out to the Camber house to investigate.The hot sun makes the conditions nearly unbearable, but Donna knows that certain death awaits them outside. Donna decides that she must do something before they both die from either heatstroke or dehydration, but the dog could be anywhere, however, and attempts at escape are foiled by repeated attacks by the mad dog, who tries to get into the car. After speaking to Vic following the break-and-enter, the local Sheriff arrives at the house. As he approaches he is ambushed by Cujo before he can draw his weapon. The gun is knocked from the Sheriff's hand by Cujo and the fight carries on inside the barn. Eventually, the Sheriff, too, is knocked from a catwalk and killed by the massive dog. Donna decides that she must risk going outside to save Tad, but the dog jumps out from underneath the car and bites her in the leg, forcing her back into the car. Eventually, a badly wounded Donna makes an attempt to dash for the house but is attacked by Cujo, the only safety being the car. She spots a baseball bat at the base of a tall tree in the yard, and gets an idea.While Cujo is distracted by a ringing telephone, Donna gets out of the car and retrieves the baseball bat. Cujo turns around on the porch to face her and she challenges him. After a prolonged, brutal struggle between the desperate mother and the relentless animal, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and beats Cujo with a baseball bat several times until the bat breaks off, leaving only a jagged handle. The dog jumps at her, only to land on the broken handle, impaling him. The dog stops moving, apparently dead. Donna pushes the dog off and uses the sheriff's revolver to break open the back window and retrieve Tad, as Cujo had broken all of the handles. Reaching the house, Donna revives her son, who had passed out due to the extreme heat and dehydration. Without warning, Cujo bursts through the kitchen window and uses the last of his strength to try to kill the two. Before he can attack, though, Donna pulls out the Sheriff's pistol and shoots Cujo at point-blank range, killing him instantly. Vic, arriving at the Camber home, sees the Pinto and the Sheriff's car, but no signs of Donna or Tad. Beginning to panic, he calls out for Donna, who joins her husband outside, carrying Tad, and the credits begin to roll."

As he drives home, a tanker jackknifes in front of him and he plows into it and black out.Johnny wakes up at the Weizak Clinic. His parents Herb and Vera (Sean Sullivan and Jackie Burroughs) are shown in by Dr. Sam Weizak (Herbert Lom). They tell him that he has been in a coma for five years and Sarah has married another man. The distraught Johnny is inconsolable.One day, as a nurse mops his brow, he seizes her hand. He has a super-real vision of being trapped in a screaming girl's bedroom.

She says that she now has a ten-month-old son, named Denny. Johnny takes it well. She tells him that his power of ""second sight"" is the talk of the town. Against Weizak's advice, Johnny gives a press conference to defuse the situation. Cynical TV reporter Dardis (Peter Dvorsky) demands a demonstration. Aware that he is being mocked, Johnny takes his hand and says ""You wanna know why your sister killed herself?"" Taken off guard, Dardis calls Johnny a freak. Johnny's distressed parents watch the event on their TV and his mother collapses. At the hospital, Johnny holds her hand as she dies.Johnny moves in with his father. A few days later, Sheriff Bannerman (Tom Skerritt) pays him a visit for his help to catch a serial killer known as the ""Castle Rock killer"". Johnny refuses. When Herb tells Johnny that he should use his power he's been blessed with, Johnny becomes furious. He thinks that his power is a curse, not a gift. One day, Sarah brings her son over when Walt (her husband) is out. She puts Denny to bed and says: ""haven't we waited long enough?"" As the scene cuts to the next, sex is implied.After watching another TV program about the Castle Rock killer, Johnny changes his mind & calls Sheriff Bannerman and agrees to help. Bannerman and Officer Dodd (Nicholas Campbell) take him to the scene of the latest murder, but Johnny gets nothing - he advises Bannerman that in order to get something, he needs a physical article that the killer was in contact with. Bannerman is called to another murder scene at the park bandstand where there is a woman's frozen corpse. Dodd identifies the woman as Alma Frechette. John takes the dead woman's hand and instantly ""sees"" a man calling to her from the bandstand. ""She knows him"" says Johnny. He watches helplessly as she is killed with a pair of scissors. The killer is revealed to be Frank Dodd. As Bannerman calls for him, he leaves in his squad car. At Dodd's house, Johnny & Sheriff Bannerman arrive where his mother tries to prevent him from entering. Johnny takes her by the arm and sees that she knew her son was the killer all along and she has been protecting him. Mrs. Dodd calls Johnny a devil, sent from hell, and that her son has been killing all ""dirty women"" in Castle Rock for their sins at her own encouragement. In an upstairs bathroom, Dodd impales himself on the scissors just as Johnny forces himself into the room. Dodd's equally deranged mother takes his gun and shoots Johnny in his shoulder. Sheriff Bannerman runs in and is forced to shoot and kill her to save Johnny's life.Following this close brush with death, Johnny moves out of town to a remote cabin. His bullet injury eventually heals, but his headaches are getting worse. He takes private tutoring jobs, and he is persuaded by millionaire lumber mill owner Roger Stuart (Anthony Zerbe) to teach his introverted son Chris. Johnny arrives at the Stuart mansion as a loud and abrasive politician named Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) is leaving. Johnny and Chris get along well, to Stuart's relief. Later, Johnny and Chris watch TV coverage to Stillson's campaign for state senator. Stuart says that Stillson is probably a liar and dangerous.In a local newspaper office, editor Brenner is confronted by Stillson and his henchman/sidekick Sonny who demand that he retract an anti-Stillson editorial in the next edition. Producing photographs of Brenner with a young woman (possibly manufactured), they threaten to ""take his head off"" if he doesn't do as they say.At one of Johnny's tutoring session with Chris, he gets interrupted by a knock on the front door and it is Sarah whom is a Stillson campaign volunteer bringing him a brochure to vote for Stillson. Another man appears at the door and Sarah introduces him as Walt, her husband. After an uneasy introduction, they leave and Johnny breaks down. As Chris hugs him for comfort, Johnny has another vision of kids in hockey uniforms and falling through the ice of a frozen lake. One of them is Chris. Johnny goes to Stuart and insists he call off the kids' ice hockey practice, or they'll drown. Stuart angrily fires Johnny despite Chris' pleas. The next day at a local news stand, Johnny reads a headline about two boys drowning in a skating accident. He calls Stuart's house, hanging up in relief when Chris answers.Meanwhile, Stillson's next rally takes place in a park opposite Johnny's house. Looking for Sarah, Johnny finds himself in Stillson's path. As they shake hands, another vision strikes: at Camp David, President Stillson orders a general to co-authorize an all-out nuclear missile launch against the USSR and the entire world which will bring on Armageddon. The 5-star General, realizing Stillson is a psychopath, refuses, but the maniacal Stillson threatens to 'cut off [the general's hand] and put it on the [scanning screen]'. Reluctantly, the General complies, and the sadistic Stillson tells the Vice President & Secretary of Defence that 'the missiles are flying....Hallelujah! Hallelujah!!'. Horrified, Johnny is rooted to the spot. Stillson is shaken by Johnny's grasp, until Sonny pushes Johnny away.Johnny goes to Dr. Weizak where he asks him that if he could go back in time knowing what he knows, would he kill Adolf Hitler? Weizak answers, 'I would have no choice but to kill the sonofabitch.' He thinks that the ""dead zone"" in Johnny's visions means that as well as seeing the future, he can also change it.Johnny decides he must take drastic action to stop Greg Stillson before he becomes President of the USA and brings on the end of the world through nuclear war. He packs up his hunting rifle and takes a bus to the Castle Rock Civic Hall, then breaks into the hall where Stillson will appears the next day and lies in wait on the balcony with the rifle. As the hall fills, the charismatic Stillson arrives and invites Sarah and Denny onto the stage with him as he gives his speech. On the balcony, Johnny rises and takes aim. Sarah sees him and screams and as a result the shot misses. As the spectators panic and fleet the hall, the equally panicked Stillson snatches Denny from Sarah and uses him as a shield. Johnny hesitates to fire again, and gets shot by Sonny and other members of the security detail. Johnny falls from the balcony and lands on the floor onto some chairs. What no one else had seen was a young photographer shooting pictures of it all before running out of the hall. Paranoid as always, Stillson walks up and grabs Johnny after recognizing him from a few days ago and demands to tell him who hired him.Johnny grabs Stillson's wrist and has a final vision where he sees a drunken and distraught Stillson in his office where there is a Newsweek magazine on his desk. The front cover shows the photo of Stillson using Denny as a shield with the headline ""No Future For Stillson"". Beside the Newsweek magazine are other magazines and newspaper headlines with the same photo describing Stillson's despicable act of cowardice. Stillson takes a loaded .45-caliber handgun from his desk drawer, points it under his chin, and commits suicide. Johnny smirks at Stillson and weakly says: ""It's over. You're finished."" Stillson then turns on Sonny Elliman, demanding to know where the photographer is. Sonny replies, disgustedly, 'I didn't see him!', suggesting that he may be just as disgusted with his boss. Greg Stillson angrily berates Sonny before running out of the hall to hunt for the photographer himself. Sonny follows, leaving the hall empty except for Sarah, Denny & Johnny. As Sarah comes up to Johnny's side, she asks him, 'Why?'. Johnny simply whispers, 'Good-bye'. Sarah starts crying, but as she kneels down next to Johnny & hugs him, she whispers to him, 'I love you....' just before he dies. As Sarah grieves for Johnny, the film fades out & credits begin to scroll across the screen."
A Christmas Story,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the 1940s, a young boy named Ralphie Parker attempts to convince his parents, teacher, and Santa Claus that a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun really is the perfect Christmas gift. Christmas is approaching and 9-year-old Ralphie Parker wants only one thing: a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun. When he mentions it at the dinner table, his mother's immediate reaction is that he'll shoot his eye out. He then decides on a perfect theme for his teacher, but her reaction is like his mother's. He fantasizes about what it would be like to be Red Ryder and catch the bad guys. When the big day arrives, he gets lots of presents including a lovely one from his aunt that his mother just adores. But what about the BB gun?—garykmcd Adult Ralph Parker is remembering back to Christmas when he was nine years old living with his parents and younger brother, Randy, in the northern town of Hohman, Indiana. Then largely known as he, he, like most kids, loved Christmas, his favorite time of the year. He often fantasized about things that he knows now would never happen, but that within a kid's mind is totally plausible. That Christmas was memorable for: his contest-obsessed father winning a prize for the first time in his life which would be the bane of Ralphie's mother's existence; his father's seemingly never-ending battle with the furnace in the house and the neighbor's pack of dogs; his mother's attempts to get Randy to eat, he at a stage when he never ate anything voluntarily; Ralphie's changing view toward the Little Orphan Annie radio program and commercial advertising; Ralphie and his friends Schwartz and Flick's changing battle with their primary bullies, Scut Farkus and Grover Dill; the triple dog dare Schwartz issued to Flick; and Ralphie's new relationship with Lifebuoy soap. But most memorable was what he wanted more than anything for Christmas: an official Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun. As it looked increasingly like he was not going to get one, he went about trying to manipulate and outwit those he thought would either be the decision makers or influencers of that gift, namely his parents, teacher, and Santa Claus, even if he was in the form of a less than empathetic department store version.—Huggo More than anything, 9-year-old Ralphie Parker wants a powerful Red Ryder carbine-action, 200-shot range model air rifle for Christmas. Instead, his mother gave him a warning. So, to get his hands on the ultimate gift of the holiday season, Ralphie embarks on a mission to talk everyone--including his father, teacher, and even Santa Claus--into seeing things his way. However, Christmas Eve is just around the corner, and all hope seems lost. Will single-minded Ralphie survive the neighbourhood bullies, escape from overbearing Aunt Clara, and convince the adults he is mature enough to get the BB gun?—Nick Riganas Set in an undeterminate year of the 1940s, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) is a nine year-old boy living in the small town of Hohman, Indiana. His older self (voice ofJean Shepherd) narrates his experiences and thoughts through the short weeks before Christmas. As he, a few friends, and his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) look into the display window of a local store, Ralphie has his eyes set on the only item he wants for Christmas; an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, with a compass in the stock and ""this thing which tells time"" (a sundial).Knowing full well that he could never request this item openly to his parents, Ralphie sneaks advertisements for the gun into his parents' magazines the next morning. At the breakfast table, he fails to bring up the subject in casual conversation, and with less subtlety than was intended. He then accidentally lets slip his desire to his mother (Melinda Dillon) who immediately rejects the idea with the dreaded phrase: ""you'll shoot your eye out.""Disappointed, Ralphie enjoys a reverie about how he alone, armed with his gun, stands between his family and a gang of stripe-shirted ruffians in a Western-style standoff. Meanwhile his grouchy father (Darren McGavin) is forced to battle the temperamental house furnace in the basement amid a slur of inaudible curses.While walking through the frozen, snow-covered neighborhood on his way to school, Ralphie meets up his two friends, Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb), while Randy lags behind, heavily bundled under a thick, wool snow jumper that leaves his arms sticking straight out. Before class, Flick and Schwartz argue over what would happen should someone stick their tongue to a frozen flag pole, engaging in a delicate nuance of phrase during which Schwartz dares Flick to stick his tongue to the pole. Upon the dreaded triple-dog-dare, Flick puts his tongue to the pole to find it stuck tight. He starts screaming but the others run into school as the bell rings. Their teacher, Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), notices Flick's absence and, when she sees him outside, calls the fire department and local police and tries to comfort Flick. As the students watch with excitement, Ralphie feels a pang of guilt. Still, when Flick is escorted to his desk, a bandage around his tongue, and Miss Shields gives a brief speech on how whoever put Flick up to sticking his tongue to the pole should atone for their misdeed. But Ralphie explains that kids know better not to get caught. Miss Shields then gives them an assignment; to write a theme about what they want for Christmas. Ralphie sees this as an opportunity to write about the Red Ryder gun, hoping that his teacher will sympathize with him and secure a little reprieve with her authority as an adult.On the way home, Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz, and Randy are confronted by a local bully named Scut Farkus (Zack Ward) and his toadie Grover Dill (Yano Anaya). Poor Schwartz is subjected to a painful hammerlock before they all run away, screaming shrilly, while Randy lags behind unable to keep up wearing his thick winter clothing.Ralphie makes it home and finishes his theme just as his father comes home, shouting excitedly, before being surrounded by the neighbor's dogs. Ralphie watches from his window above and comments how his neighbors, the Bumpuses, owned dozens of bloodhounds that ignored everyone else on earth except for the Old Man. Mr. Parker exclaims that he won a grand prize in a local magazine sweepstakes, showing his wife the telegram that says it will be delivered that night.During dinner that night, Randy displays his typical dissent for food and refuses to eat until his mother playfully asks him how pigs eat. Randy dives into his food face first, laughing hysterically, while Mr. Parker and Ralphie watch with mild disgust. Then, the doorbell rings and everyone immediately stops. They run to the door where Mr. Parker allows the delivery men to wheel in a large box and opens it with fervor to reveal a lamp that's designed to look like a woman's leg, complete with stocking, high heel shoe, and a shade that looks like a skirt. While Mr. Parker gushes over it, Ralphie's mother is clearly uncomfortable, especially when her husband tells her to display it in the front window for the entire neighborhood to see. Only one thing draws Ralphie and his brother away from the glow of electric sex gleaming in the window, and that's their favorite radio program; ""Little Orphan Annie.""The next day at school, Ralphie hands in his theme and has a momentary daydream where his paper is given the best grade in class before being brought out of it by Miss Shields. After school, he and his friends are once again chased through the alley by Scut and Grover.Upon arriving home, he checks the mail to see that his long awaited package from the Little Orphan Annie Secret Society with his secret message decoder pin has arrived. He listens to the encrypted message on the radio that night and rushes up to the bathroom to decode it, only to realize that the secret message is nothing but an advertisement for Ovaltine. Wiser, but nonetheless disappointed, Ralphie casually swears under his breath.Later that night, the furnace blows black smoke into the kitchen again and the Old Man rushes down to do battle. Mrs. Parker appears complacent as she strolls into the living room with a watering can before a loud crash is heard. Ralphie watches as his father rushes up the stairs and finds his wife holding his broken lamp. She admits it was an accident before shouting, after Mr. Parker claims she was jealous that he won it, that it was the ugliest lamp she's ever seen. Mr. Parker attempts to fix the lamp but it quickly falls apart, much to his wife's amusement. He musters all the dignity he can as he takes the remains to the back yard and buries them.At school, the students bring in apples as small gifts for Miss Shields before Christmas. Ralphie gives her a large fruit basket, hoping that it will help sway her final decision on his paper.That evening, the family goes out to pick a Christmas tree. On the way home, the car blows a tire and Mr. Parker goes outside to fix it. When his mother encourages him to help his father, Ralphie is only happy to do so, but when his father accidentally knocks the hubcap that Ralphie is using to hold the tire bolts out of his hands, Ralphie utters the big one that he heard his father say in private over and over again. Ralphie says: ""oh, fudge!"" (Actually the F-dash-dash-dash word).At home, his mother puts a bar of soap in his mouth, one that he dislikes in taste above all others he's had the opportunity to sample. His mother asks where hes heard that word and, although Ralphie admits to us that his old man used the word as fluently as an artist would use paint, he chickens out and blurts out his friend Schwartz's name. When Mrs. Parker calls Schwartz's mother and tells her, we hear her screaming maniacally and giving Schwartz a sound beating. She sends Ralphie to bed and tries the soap and dislikes the taste.Sent to bed early, Ralphie cries to himself and fantasizes about visiting his parents years into the future to reveal that all the soap sessions his mother gave him resulted in premature blindness, causing his parents to moan and grieve over their wrongdoing.At school, Ralphie is handed his theme back from Miss Shields. He looks in horror at the large C+ stamped across the top with the phrase ""you'll shoot your eye out"". He imagines his teacher clad in a witch's outfit, laughing at him next to his harlequin mother who must have surely gotten to her. Ralphie spends the rest of the day in class feeling depressed and hopeless that he'll never get the Ryder BB gun and surrounded by happier kids who were all getting what they want for Christmas.On the way home, Ralphie walks alone and is suddenly hit in the face with a snowball. He takes his glasses off and sees Scut Farkus and Grover Dill approach him. Ralphie tears up until Scut starts to mock him and laugh, Ralphie, having had enough of Scut and Grover bullying him his friends and Randy, to snap and he charges angrily at Scut, tackling him to the ground and beating him. Grover runs off as the neighborhood kids cheer Ralphie on. Randy picks up his discarded glasses and goes to get their mom as Ralphie starts to swear. She arrives just as Ralphie is finishing a rant of slurred curses. She gets a distraught Ralphie off of Scut and helps him walk home. Scut is left to pick himself up with a bloodied nose. As Flick and Schwartz scoff at him.Ralphie is inconsolable by the time he gets home, his mom takes him to the bathroom, and splashes water from the sink on his face. And even though she tries to calm him and puts him to bed until dinner, as Ralphie lays on his bed, his adult self says that ""The light was getting purple and soft outside."" Meanwhile, Randy hides himself under the kitchen sink, crying that ""Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie"". When Mr. Parker does come home, Ralphie goes downstairs, fearing the worst and knowing full well the mix of bad words he'd said during the fight. However, his mother is sympathetic and downplays the fight to Mr. Parker, giving a grateful Ralphie a reprieve. As Ralphie goes to sleep that night, the ""Scut Farkus Affair"" behind him, he decides the best way to receive his BB gun is to ask Santa himself.The next night, (Christmas Eve) the family goes downtown to watch the Christmas parade. Ralphie is impatient and keeps asking to leave early so that they can see Santa Claus. As soon as Santa goes by in his float, his parents concede and take him and Randy to the department store where Santa (Jeff Gillen) sits atop a frosty mountain, a long line of kids on one side and a slide going down on the other. Ralphie's parents let him take Randy while they go off on their own. Stuck at the end of a very long line, and with a Santa enthusiast nicknamed Goggles (David Svoboda) to awkwardly content with, Ralphie can only wonder if he'll make it to see Santa before closing time. When they finally make it to the top, Goggles sits on Santa's lap and immediately starts screaming before being put on the slide. Randy follows suit and Ralphie is escorted by an irritable helper elf (Patty Johnson) to sit on Santa's lap. His perspective, as he's swung around, shows clearly why most kids are afraid of Santa. In shock himself by Santa's intimindating face, Ralphie is unable to tell Santa exactly what he wants. Santa suggests a football to which Ralphie numbly agrees. He comes to his senses just as he's about to go down the slide and stops himself, struggling back to the top where he blurts out what he really wants. He gives his best smile, but Santa merely repeats what Ralphie fears, ""you'll shoot your eye out, kid"" before putting his boot to Ralphie's forehead and pushing him down the slide. Ralphie's parents collect him and Randy at the bottom and take them home where they decorate the tree (a task that results in blowing a dangerously packed outlet). The boys are then ushered quickly up the stairs to bed.The next morning, Ralphie wakes up to see that fresh snow has fallen overnight and goes downstairs eagerly with his brother, who claims that everything in sight is his. Their parents follow suit and presents are unwrapped with frantic excitement (except for socks). When all is said and done, Randy lies sleeping amid the wrappings with his toy zeppelin as Ralphie sits on the couch with his parents. His father asks if he got everything he wanted that year before pointing out a mysterious package behind the desk. Ralphie goes to unwrap it and finds what he thought he'd never get; the Red Ryder BB gun. His father chuckles as he fills it with BB pellets and asks to try it out. Mr. Parker explains to his wife that he had one when he was eight years old, though she still worries Ralphie will hurt himself. Ralphie runs outside and sets up his metal target board while his father drools over the Christmas turkey his mother is making.Ralphie takes aim, fires, and falls back; the pellet having bounced off the target and hitting him on the cheek, knocking his glasses off. Fearful for a second that he actually did shoot his eye out, the half-blind Ralphie collects himself and looks for his glasses but accidentally steps on them, breaking them. Despondent, he tries to think of a way to explain the accident to his mother and decides that an icicle falling off the garage would have to work. He fakes some tears and goes to his mother. She takes him to the bathroom upstairs to wash his face off with a damp cloth.(Though Ralphie is ecstatic that his plan worked) and gives him an old pair of glasses to use.Meanwhile, the Bumpuses' street bloodhounds get into the house and run rampant through the kitchen, eating all of the turkey. Mr. Parker chases the dogs out, yelling at the top of his lungs and Mrs. Parker sobs as her work of Christmas dinner is ruined. Before announcing to everyone that they're going out to eat. They go to a Chinese restaurant where the family listens to the waiters' attempts to sing carols before the main course is brought out, with its head still intact. The owner (John Wong) casually takes out a butcher knife and chops the head off while the family claps and begin to eat.That night, Ralphie sleeps with his Red Ryder held close, the best Christmas gift he ever received, dreaming of hunting ducks and making spectacular shots."
Hot Dog... The Movie,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087425/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Harkin Banks heads to skiing championships in California. A teen runaway tags along as he parties and competes with friends and foes. Harkin Banks is a young Idaho farm kid who is also an ace at skiing. He is headed to the freestyle skiing championships in Squaw Valley, CA along with runaway Sunny. He meets his adversary in the form of Rudy, a self centered European skier who doesn't take a liking to Harkin or his new found friends, The Rat Pack, led by veteran Dan O' Callahan. Harkin has many misadventures with Dan and his buddies, but doesn't lose focus in his attempt to get the World Cup.—Pat McCurry <ccgrad97@aol.com> Harkin Banks is a naive, skiing-obsessed, young man from Idaho who travels to Sqwak Mountain, California to compete in the FIA International Skiing Competition. Along the way Harkin picks up wild and outgoing teenage runaway, Sunny, who decides to tag along with him. Then Harkin meets skiing professional Dan O'Callahan and his group of misfit skiers to compete against the arrogant, three-time FIA Austrian champion Rudi Garmisch. While Harkin squares off with Rudi by day, he and Dan go partying by night with their friends which includes hot-tub and steam-room making out with various women, including Rudi's former bombshell flame Sylvia.—matt-282 When Harkin Banks (Patrick Houser) stops for gas in a remote town, he sees a young woman named Sunny (Tracy Smith) get tossed out of the vehicle in which she has been hitchhiking on her way to San Francisco, California. He offers her a ride and tells her he will be skiing the world freestyle skiing championship in Squaw Valley, California. They stop at a motel for the night and with only one bed in the room, Sunny tells Harkin to ""pick a side and stay there.""Back on the road the next morning, Sunny asks why Harkin didn't try to seduce her, and asks if he is a virgin. He is non-committal and then asks her the same question. Sunny does not answer directly, but tells Harkin that he missed his chance. She lets it be known that she does not have to be in San Francisco right away, and asks if she can come along to Squaw Valley.That night, they arrive at the Fantasy Motel and ring the desk bell, interrupting the female desk clerk (Crystal Smith) who is in an indoor hot tub in the back room with a male companion. The clerk comes to the lobby fully naked, with only a towel wrapped around her hair. Sunny drags Harkin to their room in order to take his eyes off the naked woman. The room lives up to the motel's name with a heart-shaped Jacuzzi tub, waterbed, and pornographic films on the television.When they go to a restaurant for dinner, Sunny and Harkin spot Austrian skier Rudolph ""Rudi"" Garmisch (John Patrick Reger), the current world champion freestyle skier. When Harkin attempts to introduce himself, Rudi rudely ignores him, and Sunny calls Rudi a ""Nazi bastard."" Dan O'Callahan (David Naughton), another skier, defuses the situation and joins Harkin and Sunny at their table. However, Dan is little friendlier than Rudi, suggesting that Harkin may not be good enough to qualify and making a less-than-subtle play for Sunny's attention. Leaving the restaurant, Sunny and Harkin go to the Lone Star Saloon for an after-dinner beer; while there, they witness a wet T-shirt contest and dance to the house rock band. Back in their hotel room, Sunny tells Harkin that he is not going to fall asleep on her two nights in a row, and they make love for the first time.After making his qualifying run in the morning, Harkin agrees to spend the afternoon skiing with Dan, Kendo Yamamoto (James Saito), Squirrel Murphy (Frank Koppala), and several other ""Rat Pack"" skiers. Arriving at the top of the hill for their first downhill run, the group meets Sylvia Fonda (Shannon Tweed), who asks Dan to introduce her to Harkin. She mentions the big party she is throwing that evening, and asks Dan to bring Harkin. Dan says that Harkin has a girlfriend, and Sylvia suggests that Sunny should come, too. As Sylvia skis off, Rudi and his ""Rudettes"" barge in front of the Rat Pack and the champion demands that Dan and Harkin leave the middle path down the mountain to him, so Dan insults him. Rudi is annoyed, but vows to get his revenge later. Dan informs Harkin that Sylvia used to be Rudi's girlfriend.While having a beer at the ski lodge, Harkin, Dan and the rest of the Rat Pack is eager to discover who made the cut when the qualifying results are posted. Harkin qualifies, as do all in the group, except Fergy (Erik Watson) and Dogger. Although the two had better runs than some of the European competition, when Dan goes to plead for his friends, the promoters claim that some Europeans had to be in the competition to accommodate the event's fourteen European sponsors.That night, while driving to Sylvia's party, Sunny pops a pill. Harkin makes it clear that he does not approve, but Sunny shoots back that spending one night together does not mean that Harkin now owns her. At their arrival, Sunny and Sylvia share a catty exchange, before Sunny wanders off and Sylvia promises Harkin a personal ""private tour."" Later, Harkin notices Sunny is with another young man, but, as the party continues, Sylvia finds Harkin and takes him upstairs where they make love. After having too much to drink, Sunny wanders the house looking for Harkin and discovers him in an embrace with Sylvia. She finds the sauna and goes inside, where Rudi and his friends are sweating out their own over-indulgence in alcohol. Recognizing Sunny, Rudi apologizes for his prior rudeness and she reluctantly allows Rudi to seduce her.The next morning as the skiers prepare to make their first day ballet runs, Rudi tells Harkin that he made love to Sunny. One of the Rat Pack informs Rudi that while he was with Sunny, Harkin was with Sylvia. The disgruntled Rudi challenges his rivals to a broom-ball match at the arena that evening. At the conclusion of the ballet ski run, Rudi receives scores in the low 9s from the judges; while Harkin's scores are only in the high 8s even though his friends think he made a better run. The Rat Pack begins to suspect that the events are rigged to favor the European skiers.Back at their hotel room, Sunny packs to leave for San Francisco as she and Harkin argue over their separate romantic adventures the night before. Harkin tries to persuade Sunny to stay, but she walks out.That evening, before the broom-ball match, Rudi and his Rudettes do warm up exercises, while the American team smoke marijuana. The Americans ultimately lose, but afterward, Dan and Harkin break into the Austrian team equipment room and loosen the bindings on the Austrians' skis. The next morning, during trial runs for the moguls, the Austrians' feet become detached from their skis.Meanwhile, Sunny, who has shown no previous interest in skiing, tries to learn the sport. When Sunny falls on the slope, Sylvia skis up to her and attempts to help, but Sunny turns the offer down, clearly making no effort to hide her contempt of her.As the mogul competition gets underway, Rudi is in first place, while Harkin and Dan rank fifth and sixth overall. In their mogul runs, Rudi scores in the high 9s, but Harkin's scores from the five judges range from 7.0 to 8.3 with only one judge giving him a 9. The attending crowd becomes angry over the slight to what they believe was Harkin's superior performance. Sunny shows up in the crowd the final day to watch the competition.In the aerial event, Rudi comes in with a near-perfect score approaching a 10.0 for his well-executed triple summersault jump, and a total cumulative score for the three days of 39.4. Harkin tells the starter that he intends to perform a jump of his own devising that he describes as a ""twist and triple"" to the skeptical starter. Harkin executes the spectacular jump flawlessly, but still does not score as well as Rudi, who wins the world championship for the third year in a row. The angry crowd boos and throws snowballs at the bias judges, and Sunny asks Rudi how it feels to win and still be second best.At an after-competition beer-drinking celebration, Sylvia makes up to Rudi, but from the club rooftop the Americans pelt the celebrants with a hail of snowballs. The Americans then challenge Rudi and his team to a ""winner-take-all"" bet at $40 a man on a ""Chinese downhill"" ski run. Dan also persuades Rudi to bring his trophy and make it part of the bet. Crash helmets, chest and body pads and spiked ski poles are part of the equipment for the Chinese downhill. An announcer calls out the rules. There are none; and whomever crosses the finish line first and grabs the trophy wins and collects the cash prize of $2,300.Crashes and take-downs ensue as skier after skier is eliminated from the competition. Rudi knocks Harkin off course, but the young American rights himself, flies through an open door at the ski lodge and crashes through a picture window and back onto the course. At the finish line, it is Harkin and Rudi, but Harkin grabs the trophy and Sunny is there to kiss him. The Americans proceed to celebrate their victory."

His equally ambitious coach aims at a college position, resulting in a clash which could crush the player's dreams.—Jerry Milani <jmilani@ix.netcom.com> For old-fashioned movie-making and salt-of-the-earth values, this drama has all the right elements.Tom Cruiseis an ambitious teen trapped in a dying mill town--unless his football skills can bring him a college scholarship. His chances look good, but will a clash with coachCraig T. Nelsonruin his dreams? A stirring story, laced with realistic gridiron action and romance. ""All the Right Moves"" is set in the fictitious, declining small steel mill town of Ampipe (short for the fictitious American Pipe works), typical of many such towns and mills situated in southwestern Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh.The movie was filmed in 1983 in part in the city of Johnstown, PA, one such town.The present writer of this synopsis lives in the real town of Ambridge on the Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh, so named for the American Bridge works that once prospered here. Since the 70s and 80s we have witnessed the closing of a number of mills and the further deterioration of several of our old steel towns, which were once booming. So-called brown fields have often replaced once proud, industrial sites. Boarded up store fronts and now vacant factories with their rows of broken windows cast a dark shadow.In the film, Stefen is a bright high school football student athlete who hopefully sees his sports accomplishments as his ticket to a college scholarship, an engineering degree, and life beyond the hopelessness of a dying mill town. Run-ins with the coach, however, dash those hopes when Stefen is cut from the team for his 'attitude' problem.Here is a sometimes painful, sometimes touching look behind the scenes at adolescence in the often-tough, often-coarse world of the small, increasingly depressed towns of industrial America."

In the face of total annihilation by the omnipotent Beast's unstoppable hordes of Slayers, the young aristocrats of two hostile neighbouring nations--the brave Prince Colwyn and the fair Princess Lyssa--are about to come into union, and form an alliance against the common enemy. However, the otherworldly adversary is all-powerful, and before long, a fateful abduction will trigger a desperate quest to the evil entity's grim Black Fortress, as Colwyn and a handful of mismatched defenders are willing to dice with death to ensure the land's future. In this suicide mission, the magical, five-edged weapon known as the Glaive is their only chance of survival. Can Prince Colwyn slay the Beast, save Lyssa and Krull, the small planet in the middle of the vast galaxy?—Nick Riganas From the sky will come the Black Fortress. From the Fortress will come the Slayers to devour the planet of Krull. Then shall a girl of ancient name become queen...she shall choose a king...and together they shall rule the planet. And their son shall rule the galaxy.—Stanford Sherman An indescribable monster and its army (the Slayers) attack the planet Krull. In order to stop the invaders, two hostile nations decide to join their forces by the marriage of Princess Lyssa and Prince Colwyn. During the ceremony, the Slayers attack the palace, kill both kings, wound Colwyn and kidnap Lyssa. The next morning, the wise Ynyr seeks and finds Colwyn. With Ynyr's help, Colwn gains possession of a magic weapon, a five bladed sword, and together they go on their quest for the indescribable monster's black fortress to free Lyssa.—Matthias Scheler <tron@lyssa.owl.de> The planet Krull has been invaded by the evil monster The Beast and his army The Slayers, two rival kingdoms have formed a alliance against The Beast and The Slayers, as Prince Colwyn, the son of King Turlord marries Princess Lyssa, daughter of King Eirig, where Prince Colwyn and Princess Lyssa's marriage will unite the two kingdoms and both Colwyn and Lyssa will rule the lands of Krull. But during the wedding, The Slayers attack and Lyssa is kidnapped. Setting out to rescue Lyssa, Colwyn joined by a fellowship companions: the Seer Ynyr, a band of escaped convicts led by Torquil, Rell, a one-eyed giant, Ergo, a cowardly magician, Emerald, a blind Seer and a young boy named Titch set off in search of The Black Fortress where Lyssa is being held captive, where The Beast intends to marry Lyssa in it's evil goal to rule Krull along with many other worlds. Armed with a powerful weapon ""The Glave"" a disc with five blades, Colwyn and his companions set off in search of The Black Fortress which changes location every sunrise, where Colwyn vows to rescue Lyssa and defeat The Beast and The Slayers.—Daniel Williamson In outer space a large asteroid-like object floats above the planet Krull. It suddenly changes course and lands on the planet. From fissures in the rock pour out a vast army of strange and fearsome creatures called Slayers. They fan out and begin to terrorize villages and cities. The ruler of the Slayers and inhabitant of the asteroid, called the Black Fortress, is a hulking alien being called the Beast. A voice, belonging to an old man named Ynyr speaks of a prophecy that one day a young prince will possess the power to defeat the Beast. Until the prophecy can be fulfilled, Krull will endure many more years of terror from the Beast and his armies.The young prince believed to be Krull's savior is Colwyn. He is betrothed to a young woman, Lyssa. The prophecy also speaks of the prince's bride being born with an ancient name and that she and her husband shall rule the galaxy if the Beast is defeated.Colwyn rides to his bride's father's castle for the wedding. He and his father & their party are delayed because the roads they travel are dangerous and there are regular patrols of Slayers. When they arrive, the marriage ceremony is put into motion. Just as the bride and groom are about to complete a tradition of exchanging a magical flame the Slayers attack the castle and interrupt the ceremony. Colwyn and his father and his father-in-law-to-be mount a valiant defense but they are vastly outnumbered. Lyssa is captured, Colwyn's father and the bride's father are slain and Colwyn himself is wounded and left for dead.Some time later Colwyn is found by Ynyr, who takes him to a hidden location to tend to his wounds. He tells Colwyn of the prophecy and that he is the prince that will save the planet. However, Colwyn must save Lyssa from the clutches of The Beast, who has taken her back to the Black Fortress. Colwyn scoffs at the plan since it is widely known that with each sunrise on the planet the Black Fortress changes location and never appears in the same place twice.Ynyr seems undaunted by the ubiquitous nature of the Black Fortress -- he believes that an old wizard named the Emerald Seer can predict the next location. Ynyr also tells Colwyn that he'll need an ancient weapon to complete the mission: the Glaive, a five-bladed star-shaped device. To retrieve it the two travel to the Granite Mountains. Colwyn makes a difficult and dangerous climb into a volcanic crevice. He finds the Glaive lying in a stream of lava. He pulls it out and the sooty coating falls off, revealing an ornate weapon. When he returns to Ynyr, the old man tells him not to make use of it until he knows he needs it.As they make their way to the Emerald Seer's home, they suddenly see a meteor-like object fly by. It turns out to be a man who introduces himself as Ergo the Magnificent, a would-be sorcerer. After a seemingly confrontational conversation, Ergo decides to join Colwyn and Ynyr when he sees a large and imposing cyclops.Some time later the party encounters a small group of bandits who all still wear shackles indicating that they are actually escaped prisoners. Colwyn recognizes that they are criminals but not without honor and that they can help him in his quest. He frees them from their shackles and appoints their leader, Torquil, his new Lord Marshal. A short time later, Ergo is nearly killed by a Slayer; he is saved by the same cyclops he'd seen when he'd joined with Colwyn and Ynyr. The cyclops tells them his name is Rell. His race has a long history with the Beast -- they'd previously been a two-eyed race of giants who'd been offered the ability to see the future. However, the Beast had tricked them into giving up one of their eyes for the ability to see only their own deaths.The band arrives at the Emerald Seer's home in a thick forest. The old man has a small apprentice, Titch, whom is befriended by Ergo. The Seer uses a large emerald to predict the next location of the Black Fortress but is violently thwarted by the Beast, who crushes the gem from his location. The Seer says that he can try again from his own temple deep in a nearby swamp where the Beast's power cannot reach.In the Black Fortress, Lyssa wanders through many bizarre chambers. She is taunted by the grumbling voice of the Beast. When one of the hallways closes in on her, she enters the fortress' central chamber where The Beast himself lives. He tells her that she must marry him so he can secure his power. She refuses and he threatens to kill more of Krull's inhabitants until she agrees.While traveling through the swamp Colwyn's band is attacked by Slayers, a distraction from the Beast's real plan, sending a creature called a Changeling to kill the Seer and take his place. The Seer's body is found by Rell, who rushes to find the party. He stops the Changeling from killing Colwyn. With no seeming way to find the Black Fortress, the party settles in for the night in a nearby forest. One of the bandits' wives provides them with food. Ynyr tells the group that he will seek the counsel of an old woman, the Widow of the Web, who can also see into the future. When Torquil scoffs at the plan, citing the fact that no one has entered the Widow's lair and lived, Ynyr tells them that he knows the Widow's real name and he may be able to speak to her and live.Ynyr enters the Widow's cave which contains a giant spider web. He is immediately pursued by the Widow's guardian, a large white spider. He calls out the Widow's name, which is the same as Colwyn's bride, Lyssa, and the Widow turns over an hourglass, stopping the spider until Ynyr can enter her chamber at the center of the web. Ynyr and the Widow have a history of unrequited love and the Widow reveals that she is trapped forever in the web because she killed the newborn son that resulted from their romance. She agrees to help Ynyr and tells him that the Black Fortress will appear the next day on the Iron Desert and will remain there until sunset. For Ynyr to leave the web alive, she gives him the sand from the hourglass. Ynyr cannot stop the sand from leaking out of his hands and the widow gravely warns him that his own life will run out when all the sand has run out. Ynyr is able to leave the cave and the spider attacks the Widow's home, destroying it.Ynyr returns to the camp and calls out the next location of the Black Fortress to the band, dying shortly after. Colwyn and Torquil puzzle over how to reach the fortress in time. Rell tells them that a species of horse, fire mares, can cross the distance. The band finds a herd of the animals and sets out, leaving Rell behind at his request: his own time of death is near and he wants to be left alone.The band rides out to the Iron Desert just in time to catch the fortress. They fight Slayers while scaling the fortress' rocky exterior. Just when it seems they will not make it inside, Rell appears and holds a closing door open for them. After they are all inside, the door finally shuts, crushing Rell.Inside the fortress, the band is separated by attacking Slayers. They encounter various traps in the many chambers of the fortress. Colwyn is able to find the central chamber where Lyssa is held captive. He uses the Glaive to cut a doorway, however the process is slow. Most of his band are able to avoid being killed by traps, however some of them die. When he finally gains entry, Colwyn again uses the Glaive to fight the Beast and finally lodges the weapon in its chest. When he gestures to retrieve it, the Glaive will not return to his hand. The Beast attacks again, seemingly invincible until Lyssa reminds Colwyn that the power of the flame used during their marriage ceremony can be used as a weapon. Colwyn fires it at the Beast repeatedly until the monster is destroyed. The traps that ensnared his comrades deactivate and they join up to escape. Colwyn uses the flame to blast a hole in the wall of the fortress, allowing them to exit. The fortress sits on a lush, open field, and begins to crumble, the pieces of it flying into outer space.Colwyn and Lyssa are officially married and we hear Ynyr's voice saying they shall rule the galaxy with benevolence."
Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086346/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On a distant planet inhabited by mutants, two bounty-hunters race to rescue three Earth female captives from the clutches of an evil mutant warlord. Three women make an emergency landing on a planet plagued with a fatal disease, but are captured by dictator Overdog. Adventurer Wolff goes there to rescue them and meets Niki, the only Earthling left from a medical expedition. Combining their talents, they try to rescue the women.—Mattias Thuresson Set in the early 22nd century, the film opens with the destruction of a space cruise liner by a bolt of nebular lightning. The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women - Nova, Reena, and Meagan - who get away in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails.In space, an alert goes out for the safe return of the women with a reward of 3,000 ""mega-credits"". A small-time salvage operator named Wolff intercepts the message and heads to the planet. Joining him is his female engineer Chalmers, who learns the planet - called Terra XI - is a failed colony that fell victim to a deadly plague and civil warfare. Wolff risks the dangers believing the reward will solve his debt problems.After landing on the barren world, Wolff and Chalmers set out in a 4-wheel drive vehicle called the ""Scrambler"". Soon, they join a battle in progress between a group of marauders (called the ""Zoners"") and a band of nomads (the ""Scavs""). The Zoners take the women before Wolff can stop them and fly away on jet-powered hang-gliders. Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into ""The Zone"" which is ruled by ""Overdog"" - their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds Chalmers - who is really a Gynoid - has been killed. Wolff continues on alone, but soon catches a teenage Scav named Niki trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead.In the meantime, the three women are taken before ""The Chemist"", the chief henchman of Overdog - a hideous cyborg with giant metal claws for hands - who administers pacifying drugs to the girls and prepares them for Overdog's pleasure.Elsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his - a soldier named Washington, who reveals he too has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off of the world they're on. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself.Still led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments - from being attacked by mutated humanoids, to strange amazon-like women and a water dragon (which the amazon-like women fear). He even loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington, and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. They agree to a 50/50 split of the reward.Wolff and Washington team up and sneak into Overdog's fortress where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki (who was left out of the rescue for her safety) decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end where Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy in turn recharges Overdog. Wolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog's claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the fortress explodes around them, Wolff and Niki run for cover and are rescued by the timely arrival of Washington, who is driving the plow machine with Nova, Reena and Meagan driving another commandeered vehicle. They all race out of the fortress in the nick of time as it explodes behind them.As the complex explodes, the three heroes, and the three rescued women, manage to get away. In the ending, Wolff invites Niki to stay with him and she agrees since they made good partners."

Their reunion is interrupted by Ernesto Bravo (Jose Perez), the city Hack Inspector, who claims that driver Tyrone Bywater (Charlie Barnett) overcharged a Japanese couple for a ride to the airport. Although Harold returns the couple's money, Bravo indicates that he will find any excuse to shut the company down. Meanwhile, Tyrone shifts Bravo's car into reverse, and when the inspector starts his vehicle, it accelerates backward into the front of a Chinese restaurant.That night at Harold's house, Albert informs his host that he intends to remain in the city and learn about the taxicab business. Although Harold is happy to have Albert as a house guest, his wife, Myrna (Anne De Salvo), is not and starts a fight with her husband over a trivial matter. Albert begins his training by riding along with the company's drivers, including Xavier (Paul Rodriguez), a well-dressed Latin American who aspires to be a gigolo, and Samson (Mr. T.), a civic-minded African American, angered over the presence of drug dealers in his neighborhood.On the day Albert receives his hack license, a driver named Ophelia (Marsha Warfield) threatens to leave D.C. Cab to work for the rival Emerald Cab Company after being angered over being robbed at gunpoint multiple times by a masked man (Dennis Stewart). Determined to keep his best driver, Harold invites Ophelia to discuss her grievances over a beer.Later, while sitting in a diner with his co-workers, Albert makes eye contact with Claudette (Jill Schoelen), the pretty granddaughter of Maudie the waitress (Diana Bellamy), who tries to discourage Albert from pursuing her granddaughter. Bravo enters the diner to announce that a violin, valued at $500,000, was left in an unidentified taxi, prompting the drivers to scramble to their vehicles in search of the instrument.Later, Tyrone and Albert drive mother and daughter Mattie and Denise to the embassy where they work as domestics, and are greeted by the children of Ambassador Rayburn, who pelt the taxi with eggs.

Albert careens through the city toward the garage, and delivers the robber to the heavily armed drivers, while proving his courage to Tyrone. Mr. Rhythm, an elderly homeless man who sleeps in the garage, finds the missing violin in one of the taxis, earning the company a $10,000 reward. Harold calls a meeting at the diner to announce that he will share the reward if his employees reinvest in D.C. Cab as partners. All refuse except Albert, who is distracted by the sight of Claudette. While the other drivers dispute the proposition, Maudie gives Albert another warning.The next day, Claudette sneaks out of the diner and spends several hours with Albert in his taxi.

Gorky Park,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085615/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Moscow police officer investigates a vicious triple homicide and stumbles upon a high-level international political conspiracy. An investigator on the Moscow police force relentlessly pursues the solution to a triple homicide which occurred in Moscow's Gorky Park. He finds that no one really wants him to solve the crime because it is just the tip of a complex conspiracy which involves the highest levels of the Moscow city government.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> On a cold winter day in Moscow, two dead John Does and one dead Jane Doe are found under the snow and ice in Gorky Park, they virtually unidentifiable because whoever killed them had surgically removed their faces and fingertips. Chief Investigator Arkady Renko of the Soviet militsiya leads the murder investigation, despite he more than willing to forgo it as for various reasons he believes the murders reek of KGB involvement, especially that of a Major Pribluda, with who he has had less than official violent run-ins before. If KGB is involved, Arkady believes his life too could be in danger if he uncovers the specifics. Beyond the extreme measures Arkady goes to identify the three, he gets his first connection to a live person in the form of Irina Asanova, a young woman who works as a seamstress on a movie crew and who seems to abhor the lot in which the Soviet life has left her. Her ice skates, which she reported missing, were found on the Jane Doe. He also finds it more than coincidental when he later encounters Irina at a fancy social gathering at the home of Iamskoy, the lead counsel for the case, he who wants Arkady on the job as the best person to uncover what's going on, especially if the KGB is involved. Iamskoy does not believe the KGB should be above the law. At the party, Irina is on the arms of an older wealthy American businessman named Jack Osborne, a furrier who is often in the Soviet Union as the only place where sable pelts can be obtained globally. Further in the course of his investigation, Arkady continually encounters who he will eventually learn is William Kirwill, a New York City police detective on the search for his missing American brother, James Kirwill, the eventual assumption being that James is one of the John Does. The closer Arkady gets to the truth, the more his life is indeed in danger as he has nowhere to hide within the Soviet system, and no means of escape, which it seems so many people involved are trying to do.—Huggo Moscow, USSR. In the opening scene, three young people are seen ice skating on the frozen pond in Gorky Park. Three days later, Soviet militsiya officer Arkady Renko (William Hurt) investigates the discovery of their bodies a short distance from the skating rink. All have been shot in the chest and mouth; their faces and fingerprints have been completely removed with surgical instruments. Renko is left anxious and paranoid when the KGB refuse to take over the investigation. Renko enlists the help of Professor Andreev (Ian McDiarmid) to reconstruct their faces.During his investigation, Renko crosses paths with William Kirwill (Brian Dennehy), a New York police detective who is in the Soviet Union investigating the disappearance of his brother James. At a weekend getaway at the dacha of Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy (Ian Bannen), Renko also makes the acquaintance of the American sable importer Jack Osborne (Lee Marvin) and his girlfriend Irina Asanova (Joanna Pacua).Renko is eventually able to piece together the victims' identities: James Kirwill, and two young Russians who were friends of Irina. He discovers that the three were busy constructing a chest for Osborne. Renko's suspicion of Osborne mounts over time, during their polite but tense conversations in social settings. When Irina is attacked by a KGB officer who attempts to inject her with a fatal overdose of drugs, Renko saves her. Nursing her back to health in his apartment, they begin an affair.Kirwill finally locates the barn where the three victims were building Osborne's chest. It was designed to smuggle six sables out of the country and to break the Soviet monopoly on their fur, potentially earning Osborne millions of dollars. Irina stubbornly continues to believe that her two friends are alive. Osborne had promised to smuggle them out of Soviet Union in return for their work; he tells Irina that they were successfully freed.Renko confronts her with Prof. Andreev's reconstructed head of one of her friends, forcing her to realize that they have been murdered by Osborne. She confesses the full details of the plot to him and then runs away. Renko and Kirwill go to Andreev's to retrieve the second reconstructed head, but a KGB agent emerges with it in a box. They follow him, and Renko is crushed to find they are back at Iamskoy's dacha. They watch from a distance as Osborne and Iamskoy supervise the destruction of the head by the KGB agent. To Kirwill's horror, it is his brother's head.Renko confronts Iamskoy in a bath house. Iamskoy cordially admits that he kept Renko on the case because Osborne was unwilling to pay a high enough price to smuggle out the sables. Renko's investigation was intended to frighten Osborne into paying more. He offers to cut Renko in on Osborne's kickback. Renko reveals that he has recorded the conversation, and Iamskoy jumps up and wrestles Renko for the gun. In the ensuing struggle, Renko's gun goes off and kills Iamskoy.Osborne flees to Stockholm, Sweden. The KGB allows Renko to travel there to supervise an exchange. He is to receive the sables from Osborne, whereupon everyone will be allowed to walk away. Renko is shown into a bedroom where Irina is waiting for him. She confesses that she fled to Osborne, who has worked her freedom into the deal for the sables. She promises Renko that his freedom can also be part of the deal. Disgusted by her treachery, Renko tells Irina she has blood on her hands. He meets with Kirwill and the two assume that as soon as the exchange is complete, the KGB will kill Irina, Renko and Osborne all at once.The next morning, at a remote farm, Renko and the KGB agents approach Osborne. They come across the corpse of Kirwill; tied to a tree with his intestines hanging out. Renko is devastated; Osborne then loudly announces that he gutted Kirwill after he killed his dogs. Osborne throws six dead sables onto the field and asks the men to lower their weapons. Renko realizes that neither side will let the other live. When Osborne shoots a man, Renko grabs Irina and runs for cover in the woods. Pribluda then kills the other man before Osborne kills Pribluda in a stand off.Osborne tries to shoot Renko in the woods. Renko finds more live sables in their cages. Irina emerges from the woods and Osborne threatens to kill her if Renko does not surrender. When Renko emerges to give up, Irina shoots Osborne. Renko, too, shoots Osborne before Irina fires multiple rounds, killing him. She asks Renko to go away with her, but Renko reveals he agreed to do the hit on Osborne in return for Irina's safety and freedom from Soviet Union, and that she'd be hunted down and killed if Renko did not return to Moscow.As Irina runs off to freedom in Sweden, Renko frees all of the sables, which run off into the woods as we hear Irina's voice repeat Renko's promise that they will meet again one day."

Why are we here, what's it all about? The Monty Python team is trying to sort out the most important question on Earth: what is the meaning of life? They do so by exploring the various stages of life, starting with birth. A doctor seems more interested in his equipment than in delivering the baby or caring for the mother, a Roman Catholic couple have quite a lot of children because ""every sperm is sacred"". In the growing and learning part of life, Catholic schoolboys attend a rather strange church service and ditto sex education lesson. Onto war, where an officer's plan to attack is thwarted by his underlings wanting to celebrate his birthday, and an officer's leg is bitten off by presumably an African tiger. At middle age, a couple orders ""philosophy"" at a restaurant, after which, the movie continues with live organ transplants.

But life doesn't stop at death. It's onto heaven, where it's always Christmas.—Arnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl) From the miracle of birth to death, and everything in between, the hilarious British Monty Python troupe attempts to shed light on the significance of existence, and the perpetually unanswered questions that torment us all. Through a seven-part series of skits, fundamental parts of our lives such as organised religion, sex education, philosophy, accountancy, contraception, and the joys of having a penis, all get the unapologetic Pythonesque treatment. However, as the boys leave no stone unturned to unearth one's purpose in this mortal world, a puzzling and penetratingly metaphysical question remains. In the end, what is the meaning of life?—Nick Riganas The film begins with a stand-alone 17-minute supporting feature entitled The Crimson Permanent Assurance (directed by Terry Gilliam). Set in London, England in present day 1983, a group of elderly office clerks in a small accounting firm rebel against their emotionlessly efficient, yuppie corporate masters. They commandeer their building, turn it into a pirate ship, and sail into a large financial district, where they raid and overthrow a large multinational corporation (before ultimately sailing to the edge of the earth and falling off).The film proper consists of a series of distinct sketches, broken into seven chapters.Part I: The Miracle of BirthA woman in labour is taken into a hospital delivery room, where she is largely ignored by doctors (John Cleese and Graham Chapman) and nurses, who are more concerned with using the hospital's most expensive equipment to impress the hospital's administrator (Michael Palin). The woman in labour notices that hospitals are changing, with ""lots and lots of machinery"".The Miracle of Birth Part II - The Third World In YorkshireA Roman Catholic man (Palin) loses his employment. He goes home to his wife (Terry Jones) and an impossible number of children, where he discusses the church's opposition to the use of contraception, leading into the musical number ""Every Sperm Is Sacred"". Watching this unfold, a Protestant man (Chapman) proudly lectures his wife (Eric Idle) on their church's tolerance towards contraception and having intercourse for fun, although his frustrated wife points out that they never do.Part II: Growth and LearningA schoolmaster (Cleese) and chaplain (Palin) conduct a nonsensical Anglican church service in an English public school. The master lectures the boys on excessively detailed school etiquette regarding the school cormorant, and hanging clothes on the correct peg. In a subsequent class, the schoolboys (Idle, Palin, Jones, Chapman, and others) watch in boredom as the master gives a sex education lesson, by physically demonstrating techniques with his wife (Patricia Quinn). Later, a team of boys is beaten physically and on the scoreboard in a violent rugby match against the masters; the scene then match cuts to Part III.Part III: Fighting Each OtherA World War I officer (Jones) attempts to rally his men (Chapman, Gilliam, Palin, Idle, and Cleese) to find cover during an attack, but is hindered by their insistence on celebrating his birthday, complete with presents and cake.A blustery army RSM (Palin) attempts to drill a platoon of men but ends up left alone when he excuses them one by one to pursue leisure activities.In 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War in Natal, a devastating attack by Zulus is dismissed due to a far more pressing matter: one of the officers, Perkins (Idle), has had his right leg bitten off during the night. The military doctor (Chapman) hypothesises that, despite not being native to Africa, a tiger might be the perpetrator. Ainsworth (Cleese), Packenham-Walsh (Palin) and a sergeant (Jones) form a hunting party, which encounters two suspicious men (Idle and Palin) dressed in two halves of a tiger suit, who attempt to assert their innocence through a succession of increasingly feeble excuses to explain why they are dressed as a tiger.The Middle of the FilmA woman (Palin), as if on a talk-show called ""The Middle of the Film"", introduces a segment called ""Find The Fish"" a brief surreal piece in which a drag queen (Chapman), a gangly long-armed man (Jones), and an elephant-headed butler eerily challenge the audience to find a fish in the scene.Part IV: Middle AgeA middle-aged American couple (Idle as the wife and Palin as the husband) heads to a dungeon-themed Hawaiian restaurant at a holiday resort. They are presented with a menu of conversation topics by their waiter (Cleese), and choose philosophy and the meaning of life. Their awkward and generally uninformed conversation quickly grinds to a halt, and they send it back, complaining ""This conversation isn't very good.""Part V: Live Organ TransplantsTwo paramedics (Chapman and Cleese) arrive at the doorstep of Mr. Brown (Gilliam), a card-carrying organ donor, to claim his liver. He protests on the basis that he is not dead, but is nonetheless gruesomely operated on against his will. Cleese's paramedic unsuccessfully attempts to chat up Mrs. Brown (Jones), then requests her liver as well. She initially declines, but after a man (Idle) sings a song about man's insignificance in the universe (""The Galaxy Song""), she agrees.In a large corporate boardroom, a businessman straightforwardly summarises his two-part report on the meaning of life: that the human soul must be ""brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation"", which rarely happens because people are easily distracted; and that ""people aren't wearing enough hats."" This is followed by an attempted takeover of the building by the Crimson Permanent Assurance from the short feature.Part VI: The Autumn YearsA posh restaurant (complete with a pianist played by Idle, singing ""The Penis Song"" à la Noël Coward), is visited by Mr. Creosote (Jones), a morbidly obese man in his autumn years. Creosote swears at the unflappable maître d' (Cleese), vomits copiously, and consumes an enormous meal and a huge quantity of beer and wine to the disgust of other patrons. After he has finished, the maître d' offers him a small after-dinner mint; despite initial resistance, Creosote eats it then explodes, showering the restaurant with human entrails and vomit.Part VI-B: The Meaning of LifeAfterwards, two of the restaurant's staff clean up the mess left behind by the late Mr. Creosoto and offer their own thoughts on the meaning of life. The maître d' converses with cleaning lady Maria (Jones). The waiter Gaston (Idle) leads the viewer to the countryside where he was born, and explains that his mother encouraged him to notice the beauty of the world and love everyone. Realising that the audience is unamused, he angrily dismisses them and walks off.Part VII: DeathA condemned man (Chapman) is allowed to choose the manner of his execution: being chased off the edge of a cliff by a horde of topless women.A depressed autumn leaf ""commits suicide"" by falling off its tree. Distraught, his wife and children quickly do likewise, followed by the rest of the tree's leaves simultaneously. (Animated segment)The Grim Reaper (Cleese) visits an isolated country house, and finds himself invited into a dinner party. Not knowing who he is, the dinner guests spend a lot of time arguing with him before finally being told they've all died from eating contaminated salmon mousse. Their souls leave their bodies, and they follow the Grim Reaper to Heaven.The dinner guests arrive in Heaven, a bright Las Vegas-style hotel where every day is Christmas. In a large auditorium filled with characters from throughout the film, a cheesy lounge singer resembling Tony Bennett (Chapman) performs ""Christmas in Heaven"", while bare-breasted women wearing Santa Claus costumes perform an elaborate dance number.The End of the FilmThe hostess from ""The Middle of the Film"" is handed an envelope containing the meaning of life, and casually reads it out: ""Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."" She retorts that ""gratuitous pictures of penises"" and other meaningless controversies would do a better job at bringing the audiences into the cinema, and bitterly announces the closing credits."

Private School,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086143/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Chris from a girls' boarding school loves Jim from a nearby boys' boarding school. Jordan also wants Jim and plays dirty. Jim and two friends visit the girls' school posing as girls. Christine (Phoebe Cates), a student at an exclusive all-girls private school, is in love with Jim, who attends an academy for boys nearby. Christine's arch rival Jordan also has her eye on Jim, and she is willing to do whatever she can to steal him away. Jim's uber-slob buddy Bubba is going with Betsy, Christine's cynical friend, though he would probably be unfaithful if any other woman were willing to get near him. Bubba and his pals sneak into the girls' school dressed in drag in hopes of reaching the Promised Land (better known as the women's shower room), while Christine and Jim run away together for the weekend, though their escapade isn't as romantic as they had hoped.—Anonymous One evening at the Cherryvale Academy for Women in southern California, student Christine Ramsay (Phoebe Cates) reads passages from a pornographic novel to her roommate, Betsy Newhouse (Kathleen Wilhoite). Outside the neighboring window, their respective boyfriends, Jim Green (Matthew Modine) and Bubba Beauregard (Michael Zorek), from the nearby Freemount Academy for Men, form a human ladder with their nerd/intellectual classmate, Roy (Jonathan Prince), as Bubba photographs senior Jordan Leigh-Jensen (Betsy Russell) taking a shower. Jordan enters Christine's room wrapped in a towel, which Bubba reaches through the window and removes as his friends collapse beneath him. Upon returning to her own dormitory, Jordan tells roommate Rita Flugel (Kari Lizer) of her disdain for Christine, which Rita perceives as jealousy over Jim Green. Though Jordan denies the accusation, she declares her intention to seduce Jim and end his romance with Christine.Later that evening, students from both schools gather for a dance in the Cherryvale ballroom. Miss Prudence Dutchbok (Fran Ryan), the headmistress, addresses the crowd and acknowledges the visiting Cherryvale Building Committee, which is sponsoring construction of a new wing for the school. She escorts the committee to her office, where they find Bubba and Betsy making love on the couch.The next day, the committee audits Ms. Regina Copuletta's (Sylvia Kristel) sex education class as she details the mechanics of intercourse. After the class, Christine decides she is ready to lose her virginity and makes a weekend reservation for herself and Jim at Hotel D'Amour, a seaside resort for honeymooners.Later that day, during an equestrian class, Jordan tries to attract Jim by exposing her breasts, unaware that he and Christine have left to buy condoms. That evening, Jim telephones Christine, as Jordan listens in on the extension. After Jordan facetiously reciprocates Jim's declaration of love, Christine and Betsy get their revenge by sneaking into Jordan's room and sabotaging a cheerleader uniform. The next day, Christine and Betsy realize (too late) they sabotaged the wrong uniform when one of Coach Whelan's (Julie Payne) breasts is exposed during cheer-leading practice. All of the girls, as well as Jim and Bubba and the Freemount football team, have a good laugh. Miss Dutchbok implicates Jordan and Rita in the prank, as well as Christine and Betsy, restricting them to campus for the week.One evening sometime later, Jim, Bubba, and Roy dress as girls (complete with dresses and makeup) in an attempt to visit Christine and Betsy. Once inside the dormitory, they encounter Jordan, who immediately recognizes them. When Jim claims to be ""Christine's sister"", Jordan invites him to her room and tries in vain to titillate him. Bubba enters Betsy's room with the intention of making love, but is discouraged by her demand for foreplay. He climbs out the window and makes his way to the gymnasium shower room to look at naked girls. But he soon becomes trapped in the sauna when Miss Dutchbok arrives to take a steam bath... leaving him trapped in the sauna. Meanwhile, Jim reveals his true identity to Jordan, who accuses him of trying to seduce her. Though Jim protests his innocence to Christine, she believes Jordan and refuses to discuss the matter. Bubba eventually escapes from the sauna and rejoins Jim and Roy where the three guys leave the girls dorm and return to their own dorm.On Parents' Day the following weekend, Jim explains the misunderstanding to Christine's father, who promises to intervene on his behalf. Betsy also speaks to Christine and convinces her to give Jim another chance. Jordan waits impatiently for her father, who embarrasses her with his habitual lateness, while Rita's father, Frank Flugel (Richard Stahl), embarrasses her with his habitual drunkenness. Mr. Leigh-Jensen finally arrives, accompanied by his latest trophy wife, a very young woman named Bambi (Karen Chase). When Mr. Flugel accidentally pushes Miss Copuletta into the swimming pool, Mr. Leigh-Jensen rescues her and offers mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which the teacher encourages.In the parking lot, Miss Dutchbok mistakes the Leigh-Jensen's chauffeur, Chauncey (Ray Walston), for his employer and asks for a donation to the school. He invites Miss Dutchbok into his limousine, draws curtains to cover the windows and seduces her. Assuming the car is empty, Bubba and Betsy make love in the front seat until they realize they are not alone. Betsy places a microphone behind the curtain and connects it to the car's loudspeaker system, broadcasting Miss Dutchbok's seduction to the party-goers. The headmistress reacts by reaching through the curtain and choking Bubba. He accidentally releases the emergency brake, causing the limousine to careen through the party and into the swimming pool.One week later, Christine and Jim leave for the Hotel D'Amour. On the Freemount campus, Bubba bets Roy and the rest of his classmates that he can persuade Jordan to remove her clothes. Expecting a rendezvous with Jim, she enters his dormitory, unaware that several boys are hidden around the room. Jordan is forced to remove her dress after Bubba sprays her with red wine, and she sends him out for club soda to remove the stain. Within moments, Betsy arrives and informs Jordan of Bubba's ruse. Upon his return, the two girls beat him and push him out the window, while the spectators emerge from their hiding places.At the hotel, Christine and Jim find the contrived ambiance of their suite not conducive to romance and go to sleep. In the morning, however, Christine joins Jim on the beach and they make love in the surf.Months later, Cherryvale's senior class graduates. Jordan rides to the ceremony with her father and his new wife, Miss Copuletta. Jim is in attendance, along with Roy, who is dressed as a middle-aged man, and Bubba, who is dressed as a woman. Mr. Flugel staggers into an adjoining seat and attempts to fondle Bubba, who knocks him unconscious. Following Miss Dutchbok's commencement speech, Betsy leads the girls in the chant, ""Graduation Cherryvale, you won't forget us soon; sunny days ahead of us, we leave behind this moon,"" after which they expose their behinds."

To Be or Not to Be,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086450/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"At the onset of WW2, a Polish actor's family and the Polish Resistance help the troupe of a theatre escape Poland and the invading Nazis. A bad Polish actor is just trying to make a living when what should intrude but World War II in the form of an invasion. His wife has the habit of entertaining young Polish officers while he's on stage which is also a source of depression to him. When one of her officers comes back on a Secret Mission, the actor takes charge and comes up with a plan for them to escape.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> A Polish actor (Frederick Bronski) and his wife (Anna) are renowned actors in Poland at the start of WWII. In the opening, Anna has been receiving flowers from a young pilot who always sits in the second row during the performances, so decides to meet with Lt. Sobinski backstage during her husband's rendition of the soliloquy ""To Be, or Not to Be."" It is during one of these interviews that word comes of invasion by the Nazis, and everything spins out of control. Sobinski is in England with a band of Polish resisters when he is sent back to Poland on a mission to save the lives of all the Polish Underground. He goes to Anna after parachuting into the country, and the rest of the movie unfolds with a comedic air as Sobinski, the Bronskis, and the theater troupe try to get out of Poland alive.—Anna-Kat In Warsaw, Poland, in 1939, a famous Polish actor, Frederick Bronski (Mel Brooks), runs a theater and its troupe of actors and staff. Most of of the Bronski Theatre's routines are comic in nature: a very popular sketch is titled ""Naughty Nazis"" and features Bronski himself playing Adolf Hitler acting buffoonish, singing about how he plans to take over Europe a piece at a time.Bronski's wife, Anna (Anne Banckroft), always plays second fiddle to her husband: he doesn't see her as an equal and even resorts to putting his wife's name on the playbill in parentheses.Germany invades Poland and the war soon comes to Warsaw. One of the theater staff asks Bronski if a few Jewish friends can hide out in the basement of the theater. He reluctantly agrees. When the Gestapo forces Bronski to cancel the Naughty Nazis sketch because it insults Hitler, Bronski announces that he'll perform his ""world famous Highlights From Hamlet"" routine.On stage, he begins to recite the play's famous ""To be or not to be..."" scene and a young Polish army office suddenly stands up and begins to walk out. Bronski is crushed (and actually gives a great performance instead of his usual below-average acting). The man, Lt. Andre Sobinski (Tim Matheson), meets with Anna in her dressing room -- the line ""To be or not to be"" was a signal for him to sneak backstage. Sobinski himself is an adoring and devoted fan of Anna's and is deeply smitten with her.One night, officials from the Gestapo arrive at the theater and demand that all Jewish cast and staff report to their headquarters and register. At first, Bronski refuses but when the Gestapo threaten to shut down the theater, he gives in. One of the staff, Anna's dresser Sasha, is a gay man. Arriving in Anna's room at night, she notices a pink triangle on his coat which he tells her is the shameful symbol that all gay men must wear under Nazi law, just like Jews having to wear a gold star of David.Warsaw is quickly overrun by the German Wehrmacht. The Bronskis home is seized by the Nazis and they go to live with Sasha. Sobinski, who is on assignment in England, is at a pub with a large group of other Poles who are mourning the fall of their country. One of the men, Professor Siletski (Jose Ferrer), is able to travel easily between Allied territory and Occupied Poland. When asked to take word to the families of the soldiers at the pub, he agrees, having all the men write down names and addresses. Sobinski asks Siletski to deliver a message to Anna, however he becomes suspicious when Siletski initially says he hasn't heard of her. Siletski backpedals a bit and says he'll deliver the message, a simple ""to be or not to be.""Sobinski meets with British officers and his own superiors, telling them that anyone from Warsaw, like Siletski claims, would definitely know who Anna Bronski is. Sobinski's superiors inform him that Siletski is actually a traitor and spy working for the Third Reich. All the people whose names he collected will be hunted down and executed as Polish underground members. Sobinski asks to be sent back to Warsaw to hunt down Siletski.At the theater, Sasha suddenly runs in having been chased through the streets. The Gestapo is rounding up homosexuals in addition to Jews. Since the theater will be meticulously searched, Sasha hides by dressing like Anna in a large musical number where Anna will join Bronski onstage. The number comes to a halt when Sasha's wig and hat fall off and he is immediately recognized by the Gestapo and arrested. The theater is also shut down and locked up indefinitely.Sobinski is able to steal into Warsaw and locates Bronski at Sasha's home. Anna is not there, having been summoned to Prof. Siletski's office at Gestapo headquarters. Sobinski tells Bronski about Siletski's plan: Siletski plans to turn the names he collected over to the head of the Warsaw Gestapo, Colonel Erhardt. Because Siletski and Erhardt have never met, Sobinski and Bronski devise a plan to have Bronski impersonate Erhardt and get the list from Siletski. The uniforms that the company uses for the Naughty Nazis sketch will be used to gather Siletski and bring him to the Bronski Theatre where a fake Gestapo office will be set up for the ruse. Siletski is brought to the fake office and meets with Bronski. He hands over the list and reveals that he'd printed up a duplicate list to be forwarded to Nazi HQ in Berlin. Bronski needs to stall for more time, but while he does he accidentally reveals that the chair he's sitting in is a prop from the theater. Siletski sees through the ruse and pulls out a pistol. Threatening to shoot Bronski in the back, he escapes into the theater. He's eventually found behind the curtain onstage and shot dead by Sobinski.With the death of Siletski complicating the situation, Bronski agrees to impersonate the dead professor and go back to Gestapo HQ, free Anna and find the duplicate list. He dresses like Siletski and wears a false goatee and meets Anna in Siletski's room. Waiting there for him is Erhardt's adjutant, Captain Schultz, who is to take him to meet with his commandant. Bronski asks for a private moment with Anna, finds the duplicate list and burns it; at the same time he confronts her angrily about her ""affair"" with Sobinski. She reminds him that he has to meet with Erhardt to continue the ruse and he reluctantly agrees. He also remembers to leave word at the desk that Anna can leave any time.Bronski is brought to Erhardt's office. Erhardt, a loud and brash and buffoonish type, asks him for the list. Bronski says that he's still compiling it but does have the names of 2 members of the Polish underground -- both names are prisoners that were executed earlier. Erhardt becomes confused and takes out his anger on Schultz. During the meeting, Erhardt also tells a few jokes about the crabby nature of the Fuhrer, which Bronski uses to his advantage in cowing the cantankerous Colonel.Meanwhile, two of the theatre staff are transporting the body of Siletski in a steamer trunk. They hit a bump and the trunk falls out of the back of the truck. Two Nazi soldiers find the body inside and it is returned to Gestapo headquarters. Anna herself is summoned to meet with Erhardt, who is smitten with her. He tells her that Hitler himself is coming to Warsaw to see the Bronski theatre troupe perform an exclusive show and that the theatre will be temporarily reopened. She asks him to release Sasha, but is flatly refused since he's scheduled for transport already.Bronski later arrives at Erhardt's office and Anna is released. However, Erhardt has other plans for Bronski: he has Bronski wait in his office with the dead body of Siletski. Bronski, having brought a 2nd fake goatee with him, uses a shaving kit in Erhardt's bathroom to shave Siletski's chin and attach the fake goatee. When Erhardt comes back in with goons to interrogate Bronski, Bronski challenges Erhardt to tug on the dead Siletski's beard. It comes off in Erhardt's hand. Believing that Bronski is Siletski, he also agrees to Bronski's demand to let Sasha go. Just as Bronski is about to leave, some of Bronski's staff arrive dressed as Nazis and tell the already flustered Erhardt that they've discovered a plot to assassinate the Fuhrer. Though they do not know that Bronski has already bluffed his way out of trouble, they pull off Bronski's fake beard anyway as proof and take Bronski and Sasha with them.Back at the theater, Anna tells everyone about the Fuhrer's impending visit. They all agree that they must flee Poland before their ruse is really discovered. They plan to sneak out of the theatre during a clown car number, then disguising themselves as SS officers and leave in the trucks and cars the real SS arrived in. Bronski himself will be disguised as Hitler, while one of his actors, Lupinsky, will recite Shylock's speech about Jewish heritage from The Merchant of Venice as a distraction for Hitler's elite guard, who are to be stationed outside his theatre box. Included in the escape will be all the Jews that have been hiding in the theatre.The performance goes off with few problems. Anna is unexpectedly met at the theater by Erhardt who continues to flirt with her. Lupinsky gives an impassioned reading of Shylock's monologue and is taken into ""custody"" and leaves with Bronski. After the clowns have all exited and Bronski is outside, he goes back inside to see what's delaying Anna. Erhardt is astonished to meet Hitler face-to-face and is left a babbling idiot when Bronski tells him he knows about a joke he'd cracked at Fuhrer's expense.The troupe drives to the airport. Most of them are able to board the Fuhrer's private plane but they are discovered by the nearby guards. Everyone makes it aboard, including Anna's little Shih-Tzu and they take off. Their compass is broken and they fly until they run out of fuel. They crash land in a large field. Bronski suggests that he go outside first in case they've landed in German-occupied territory. He finds a small pub and goes inside, still dressed like Hitler. The pub is British and the customers and staff are all shocked.Later, Bronski and Anna meet with British officials and are granted asylum in England until the war ends. Bronski requests that his troupe be allowed to perform, specifically Bronski's Highlights From Hamlet sketch. While in front of a respectful audience, he recites ""To be or not to be..."" and a young man suddenly rises and begins to excuse himself. Bronski is flustered. Before the closing credits roll, the cast all take congratulatory bows while the actors' names flash on the screen."

Oghris explains that Munkar has invited warriors from across the land to participate in contests until a winner is determined - the winner will inherit Munkar's kingdom. One night along the way to the tournament, the pair meet Kaira, a female warrior (Lana Clarkson) who wears only a G-string and a cloak. Later that night Deathstalker removes Kaira's skimpy outfit and has passionate sex with her. She joins the group on their journey the next morning.Munkar reveals to his assistant that his true agenda is for the warriors to fight each other to the death until only a weakened survivor remains for Munkar to kill. This would remove all threats to his rule. Arriving at Munkar's castle, Deathstalker, Oghris, Kaira and the other participants gather in Munkar's banquet room the night before the tournament. The warriors are invited to get drunk and rape Munkar's harem slaves, including Princess Codille (Barbi Benton). Oghris connects with one slave girl while Kaira keeps Deathstalker to herself. Deathstalker rescues Princess Codille, briefly, but Munkar takes her back. Munkar transforms his assistant into the likeness of the Princess and sends him to kill the hero. When Deathstalker attempts to rape Codille, he discovers that the woman is not all ""woman"" and sends her away. Kaira finds the assassin; assuming she is the real Codille, she is tragically killed by the assassin in a sword fight after Munkar's disguise spell wears off.The night after the first day of the tournament, Oghris is taken by Munkar's men to a prison cell while Salmaron is attacked by prison guards. The thief is knocked into a well that leads to Munkar's harem. It is revealed that Oghris brought Deathstalker to the tournament expressly for Munkar and he is ordered to kill him. Reluctant to kill his friend, Oghris warns Deathstalker and asks the hero to just leave the tournament but Deathstalker refuses and attacks him. During the brawl, Oghris has the chance to draw the sword and kill Deathstalker but chooses to fight fairly and ultimately loses. Deathstalker says goodbye to the fighter and kills him.The last day of the tournament arrives and there are only two competitors left - Deathstalker and an ogre. After a long fight, Deathstalker kills the ogre and moves to claim his prize. He is attacked by Munkar's men but makes his way to the amulet. Salmaron is discovered in the harem room but frees the women and helps them slay the guards. Deathstalker defeats the holder of the amulet and faces Munkar; he is able to defeat the sorcerer's illusions and claims the third object of power. Deathstalker declares he has no interest in Munkar's power or kingdom - he destroys the three objects of power and throws Munkar to a crowd of slaves who tear him apart."
Zelig,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086637/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"""Documentary"" about a man who can look and act like whoever he's around, and meets various famous people. Fictional documentary about the life of human chameleon Leonard Zelig, a man who becomes a celebrity in the 1920s due to his ability to look and act like whoever is around him. Clever editing places Zelig in real newsreel footage of Woodrow Wilson, Babe Ruth, and others.—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> Mockumentary on the period of fame and infamy of Leonard Zelig in the 1920s and 1930s. He first came to world attention when it was noticed that he appeared in several newsreels more often than not prominently in the background, but sometimes with the newsreels' more famous subjects. But what was considered more remarkable than the varied subjects and the prolific nature of his newsreel footage was that he changed his appearance, sometimes even seemingly his ethnicity, and abilities and skills to match those around him. Eventually under the care of famed psychiatrist Dr. Eudora Fletcher, he was given the nickname the Chameleon Man in his ability to change his being so effortlessly. Dr. Fletcher's diagnosis was Zelig's need for ultimate conformity in an effort to be universally liked, the malady which she tried to cure. The mockumentary delves not only into the psychiatric issues for Zelig, but also the legal issues he faced on wanting and being able to conform so easily. It also focuses on Zelig and Dr. Fletcher's relationship, which became more than just patient and doctor.—Huggo The story of Leonard Zelig, a man who could (and would) assume the physical characteristics and mannerisms of anyone he cam into contact with. When doctors discover him, they try to figure out why he has this ability and what causes him to change. Eventually he is treated by Doctor Eunora Fletcher, a psychiatrist, and she works out how to treat him. Meanwhile, dubbed ""the human chameleon"", he becomes a celebrity. Celebrity has its downsides, however.—grantss"

Sleepaway Camp,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086320/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Angela Baker, a shy, traumatized young girl, is sent to summer camp with her cousin. Shortly after her arrival, anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions toward her gets their comeuppance. After a horrible boating accident kills her family, shy, sullen Angela moves in with her eccentric Aunt Martha and protective cousin Ricky. One summer, Martha sends the kids to Camp Arawak. Soon after their arrival, bizarre, increasingly violent accidents claim the lives of various campers. Who is the twisted individual behind these murders? The disclosure of the murderer's identity is one of the most shocking climaxes in the history of American cinema.—Drew Over the opening credits, we see a closed-down summer camp in the fall that is called Camp Arawak.The film opens in the summer of 1975, with a family consisting of divorcée John Baker (Dan Tursi) and his two children, Angela and Peter, out on a lake near a summer camp in upstate New York. After their small boat accidentally flips, John and the children begin to head ashore, where John's lover Lenny (James Paradise) is calling to him. As the family swims, a pair of teenagers named Marianne and Craig are pulling a water skier named Dolores in a motorboat. Craig and Marianne switch places to that the girl can drive the boat, but they fail to notice the family in the water in time and hits them, which kills both John and Peter. The survivor, Angela, is sent to live with her eccentric aunt, Dr. Martha Thomas (Desiree Gould), and Martha's son Richard ""Ricky"" Thomas.Eight years after John and Peter's deaths, Angela, now age 14 (Felissa Rose), and Ricky, now age 15 (Jonathan Tiersten), are sent to Camp Arawak by Martha, who reminds them not to tell anyone how they got the signatures for their physical exams. The buses arrive at the camp, and Artie (Owen Hughes), the creepy head cook, admires the children with no reservations in front of his coworkers calling them ""baldies"". Ricky introduces Angela to his best friend Paul (Christopher Collet), and he shows Angela around the camp since he was there last summer. Angela goes not respond when Paul talks to her and backs away after he finishes the tour. Ricky tries to talk to Judy (Karen Fields), his former girlfriend from last summer at the camp, but she hardly acknowledges him.Because of her introverted nature and her shyness, Angela is ridiculed and bullied--her main tormentors being Judy and camp counselor Meg (Katherine Kamhi). During lunchtime, Angela, having not eaten for some time, is taken into the kitchen by the sympathetic head counselor Ronnie (Paul DeAngelo) to see if there is anything in there she would like to eat. Left alone with the greasy head cook Artie, Angela is taken into a back room by Artie, who intends to molest Angela. Before any harm can come to Angela, Artie is found in the midst of unfastening his pants by Ricky, who flees from the kitchen with Angela after Artie threatens him. After the incident in the pantry, Artie is seriously injured when he is knocked off a chair by an unseen figure while tending to a large pot of boiling water that spills on most of his body. Artie's injuries are deemed accidental by camp owner Mel Costic (Mike Kellin), who pays off the rest of his kitchen staff, including the assistant cook Ben (Robert Earl Jones), to keep the event quiet and tells the replacement cooks to tell the campers that Artie left for another job.The next day, Ricky, Paul, and the rest of the boys in their cabin, including geek Mozart (Willy Kuskin), are playing baseball with Kenny (John Dunn), Mike (Tom Van Dell), Billy (Loris Sallahian), and the rest of the boys from another cabin. After Ricky wins the game to the older guys, Kenny talks with Mike about how to get back at Ricky.Later that night in the recreation cabin during a dance, Angela is accosted by Kenny and Mike, who begin mocking her for not speaking, which prompts Ricky and his friend Paul to get into a fight with the boys in which several others join in, which fulfills their plan of getting back at Ricky. After the brawl is broken up by counselor Gene (Frank Trent Saladino), Ricky and the rest of the boys involved in the fight leave while Paul stays behind and succeeds in befriending Angela by telling her about misadventures he and Ricky would get into when they were younger. The shy Angela still does not talk, but when Paul begins to leave, she speaks for the first time and tells him ""good night"".Later that night, Kenny is rowing a boat with his girlfriend Leslie (Lisa Buckler), and he rocks and overturns the boat. Leslie angrily swims away as Kenny, underneath the overturned boat, is attacked and pushed underwater by an unseen person. In the morning, Kenny's dead and decomposing body is found, and his death is also ruled accidental by Mel, despite suspicion from Ronnie and the police, especially a cop named Frank (Allen Breton).Later that day, Angela walks up to Paul and begins to talk to him as he watches the girls play volleyball, much to Judy's irritation. Meg tells Angela that she either must participate or do nothing, which includes talking with boys.That evening, Paul and Angela go to the rec room to watch a movie, and they later leave when the movie is over, hand in hand as Angela slowly starts to become more friendly with him. When they are alone, Paul attempts to kiss Angela, but she gets uptight and walks back to her cabin.The next day at the lake, Paul sits beside Angela, who tells him that she cannot go in the water. Paul gets up and leaves when Meg arrives. Meg then asks Angela if she is going to swim, but Angela stops talking. Meg angrily shakes the silent girl until Ronnie pulls her away and tells her to leave Angela alone.In the girls cabin, Judy approaches Angela and is angry, thinking that she got Meg into trouble. Then Judy begins mocking Angela again and asks her why she will not shower or go swimming, or change clothes with the other girls. Angela continues to be silent, (but it is clear at this point onward that she is hiding something).Later that day, Angela is hit in the face with a water balloon by Billy and his friends, who are on a cabin rooftop throwing water balloons at passersby. Mel reprimands the boys on the roof and then grounds Billy for the rest of the summer. Ricky comes to the aid of Angela and tells her, ""I'll kill him!"" A little later, while his friends go off to play basketball, Billy stays behind in the cabin and goes into the restroom to take a ""wicked dump"". An unseen person locks him in the toilet stall. The unseen person then cuts the screen behind Billy and shakes a hive full of live bees into the room. Billy eventually breaks out of the stall but is stung to death, with bees covering his face.When Mel learns about Billy's death, he becomes more unsettled because he thinks that the camp will be shut down. Mel also grows suspicious of Ricky, whom he believes is killing those who bully Angela.The relationship between Angela and Paul grows strained when, that evening, Paul attempts to make out with Angela on the beach, which causes Angela to have a flashback to her youth when she and her brother Peter witnessed their father in bed with Lenny. Angela rejects Paul, who tries to have sex with her, and runs away.The next day, Paul, being confused and angered by Angela's rejection of his advances, is easily seduced by Judy, who lures him away from a game of capture the flag, a game assembled by counselor Jeff (Rick Edrich). In the woods, Angela and Ricky talk about Paul and his intentions where Ricky expresses to Angela that he does not trust him, but Angela reminds Ricky that Paul is just a friend. They both happen by Paul and Judy kissing which prompts Angela to run off. A little later, feeling guilty about what happened between him and Judy, Paul attempts to explain himself to Angela while on the beach at the lake but this time, she does not want to talk to him.Later that day, as Paul tries again to talk to Angela, he is shooed away by Judy and Meg, who pick up Angela and throw her into the water. After being taken out of the lake by lifeguard Hal (Mike Mahon) and having sand flung at her by several small children, a clearly disturbed Angela is comforted by Ricky, who swears vengeance on her aggressors.That evening, Meg, while preparing for a date with Mel, is murdered with a knife while taking a shower, having her back sliced open. Meg's disappearance goes largely unnoticed and camp activities go on as usual with a social being held. While there, Angela is approached by Paul, who again tries to apologize over the incident with Judy. Angela, for some strange reason, tells Paul to meet her later that night at the waterfront after the social.Next, six young children, the ones who threw sand at Angela, are taken camping with counselor Eddie (Fred Greene), and when two of them ask to go back because they feel sick, Eddie takes the two back to his car and drives back to the camp. But when Eddie comes back, he finds the other four children in their sleeping bags, hacked to bits with Eddie's ax, which was used to cut wood, lying on the ground, dripping with blood.Meanwhile, Mike and Judy are kissing, and Mike hides when Mel stops to ask where Meg is. After Mel leaves, Mike decides that he'd better leave. Mel finds Meg's dead body in the shower stall and thinks that Ricky killed her to get back at him.Judy, who had decided to skip the social to be with Mike, goes back to the girls' cabin, and he is killed when the unseen killer enters, and pushes her out. The murderer shoves a pillow on her face and forces a curling iron somewhere unknown (possibly her vagina).After the social, the camp is thrown into a panic when Eddie arrives and tells the counselors about the deaths of the four children. Ricky, who missed the social because he felt sick, overhears this news before being attacked by Mel, and he accuses him of killing Meg and all the others. After beating Ricky seemingly to death, Mel stumbles into the camp archery range, where he is shot in the throat with an arrow by the real killer.Ronnie calls the police and then tells Marie (Dee Dee Friedman) to gather the other counselors to round up the surviving campers to put them into one cabin until they can root out the killer. As the counselors and the police scour the camp, Angela meets Paul on the beach, where she tells him to undress, which Paul enthusiastically agrees to do.Ronnie and Marie find the dead Meg and Mel, while Frank the cop and Gene find Ricky, who is still alive. Gene carries the badly beaten Ricky away to a waiting ambulance as Frank radios for backup.Ronnie and Susie (Susan Glaze) find Angela nude on the beach, softly singing to herself and clutching a large knife and Paul's severed head in her hands. Angela is revealed to be both the killer and a boy--the thought-to-be-dead Peter.Through flashbacks, it is shown that after Martha gained custody of him, she decided to raise Peter as a girl, already having a son and coming to the conclusion that another boy simply would not do. It's also implied that Peter/Angela was mentally affected in a very negative way by seeing his/her father sharing a homosexual embrace with another man. The film suddenly ends with the nude and blood-covered Angela, male genitalia in full view, standing before Susie and Ronnie, letting out an animalistic hissing sound."
The Man Who Loved Women,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085891/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A womanizing sculptor named David goes to seek help from a psychiatrist, Marianna, to cure him of his obsession with women. Marianna (Dame Julie Andrews), a Los Angeles based therapist, tells the story of one of her patients, middle-aged David Fowler (Burt Reynolds), a successful sculptor. He originally came to see her due to his sudden impotence in all aspects of his life, including in his art and in his sex life, the latter especially worrisome as he has always adored women in the holistic sense, they in general who adore him right back. David's sessions with Marianna have most often been comprised of him talking about the women in his life, past and present, those in his early life, who included his single mother, who had her fair share of suitors and lovers, and a plethora of prostitutes, one to whom he lost his virginity, and the profession which he has always treated with respect beyond the issues of many women resorting to the business as a last resort to survive. He has moved from one girlfriend or lover to another in his fear that he would miss something special in the women he has not yet met. Those women include, but are not limited to: Courtney Wade (Cynthia Sikes), local on-air television personality who pampers him with her cooking; Agnes Chapman (Marilu Henner), who may have the best looking legs in the world according to David, but who tells David in return that the legs he saw to which he was initially attracted were not hers; Louise Carr (Kim Basinger), the wife of a Houston-based client, wealthy Roy Carr (Barry Corbin), David's sexual encounters with Louise, which are characterized by their riskiness and her canny ability to calculate the time required; and David's assistant Nancy (Jennifer Edwards), the one woman to whom he was attracted, but with whom he had never slept, due to the vulnerable state she was in when they met. Beyond trying to figure out what has caused David's current issue, Marianna has to admit to herself that she too is not immune to his charms. All of these women realize that they are most-likely temporary fixtures in his life, but love him nonetheless. However, one woman may make him feel true love, enough to want to settle down with her.—Huggo This is the tale of a sculptor named David Fowler (Burt Reynolds), who has a major womanizing problem.

He opens a doll shop but is unwittingly importing heroin in the dolls. When his friend betrays him, Cho must prepare for the ultimate battle. After his family is killed in Japan by ninjas, Cho and his son Kane come to America to start a new life. He opens a doll shop but is unwittingly importing heroin in the dolls. When he finds out that his friend has betrayed him, Cho must prepare for the ultimate battle he has ever been involved in.—Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca> Tokyo, Japan: A family gathers at a peaceful temple amidst a quiet pond. One of them is a young woman carrying her newborn baby boy. Evil ninjas come along and waste them all. The young mother is able to hide her baby among some brush before the ninjas riddle her body with arrows.Cho arrives with his American friend Braden. Braden is trying to persuade Cho to come to America with him where Braden will front the capital for Cho to open a pottery gallery. Cho doesn't want to leave because his whole family is here, and his father and grandfather died on this land.They become alerted to the ninjas and waste them all. Braden takes out a few with gunshots and then proves skilled in martial arts as well. Cho mourns his slain young wife, Yoshi, but finds his youngest son, Kane, still alive among the brush where Yoshi placed him. Braden repeats his desire to bring Cho to America. If not for himself, then for his baby son. Cho's mother doesn't trust Braden and warns Cho that his karma will follow him all across the world, even to America.The scene fades to the American flag flying just above the state flag of California. It is six years later. Kane is now an elementary school student; he leaves school and is being walked home by his grandmother. Five bullies start to pick on him and he punches their faces in until Cho stops him, angry at Kane for fighting 'common street brawls.' Cho's mother reminds her son that fighting will follow them all no matter where on Earth they are. She implores Cho that he must teach Kane the ways of the Ninja.Cho begins teaching Kane, but reminds him that they are now vendors of traditional Japanese pottery and ceramic dolls, and although they keep the tradition of their knowledge of fighting arts alive, Cho's sword is sealed forever, and he and Kane are not samurai or ninja, in honor of Yoshi, who died because of 'the way.'As Kane demonstrates his prowess, a blonde woman, Cathy, enters the dojo and watches. She assists Cho in preparing the gallery for opening in return for martial arts lessons. Cathy is romantically interested in Cho as well, though he does not return her affections. Cathy spars with Cho and holds her own.Braden brings an investor to the gallery where Cho shows her the collection of ceramic dolls. The investor is fascinated by a doll of a ninja. Cho tells the investor some of the background of Japanese ninja. As Cho turns to talk with Braden about the gallery opening, the investor runs her finger along the miniature ninja sword in the doll's hands and is shocked as it cuts her finger; the miniature sword is truly sharp.Kane enters the gallery and tries to move a doll for a closer look. The doll falls from the pedestal and breaks on the ground, and a white powder spills out. Cathy scolds Kane, saying Cho will be very angry for breaking an expensive ceramic doll. Finally she gently tells him that she won't tell Cho that Kane broke it, but Kane has to promise her that he'll never touch the dolls again. She sends Kane off and carefully cleans up the mess.Braden's true colors are quickly revealed as Cathy (who is secretly Braden's lover) tells him about the broken doll; Braden is using them to smuggle and distribute heroin. This is the true reason why Cathy works for Cho without pay; she's watching the dolls for Braden. Braden is meeting with a contact named Caifano later that day and hopes to unload as much of the drugs as possible.Braden goes to see Caifano, who is a mob boss, to tell him that the dolls have arrived and are ready for delivery. Braden wants to unload the 'hot cargo' immediately, as his Japanese contacts want the money for the heroin immediately on delivery. But Caifano tells Braden that he needs to sit on it for a few more days. A heated dispute quickly follows with both Braden and Caifano warning each other not to cross them. Braden tells Caifano that he doesn't know Braden yet, and in the next scene it's quickly shown what Braden meant-- he is part of the evil ninja clan; a fully trained ninja. Braden is seen quietly rubbing out one of Caifano's men who pointed a gun at Braden during the confrontation with Caifano.Caifano and his men have a covert meeting with a vagrant contact who tells him that he probably won't be able to get his money today because of rumors of a large shipment of ""H"" (heroin) from Japan that's hitting the streets. The scene cuts to Braden's hand reaching into his suitcase. Just as caifano and his men are getting back into their car, the vagrant contact is assassinated by a ninja throwing star hurled right into his eye, right out in the open street while dozens of pedestrians walk right by, completely oblivious until the vagrant slides into a street-corner fountain, blood flowing into the water.The camera pans along the inside of a house; a man and woman are heard moaning as they make out in a hot tub. Braden's hand reaches into his suitcase (we know it's his because of what's inside). He takes out the man with a blown poisoned needle and then uses the blow gun to force the woman's head under the water of the hot tub until she drowns.Police and paramedics are on the scene. Two cops talk as Caifano arrives. The three men killed were Caifano's brother, one of his 'stoolies,' and now his nephew. Caifano argues with the lieutenant, who wants to know who is muscling in on Caifano's operations.The lieutenant goes to consult Dave Hatcher, a karate instructor for the police, and shows him X-rays of Caifano's brother, showing the extensive injuries and numerous broken bones that were precisely delivered at 90-degree angles like a machine, with no weapons. Hatcher says that the only men he's heard of who could inflict such trauma on the human body with no weapons of any kind lived in Japan 400 years ago. Hatcher does have a friend who he says is an expert on these clans.This friend of course, is Cho, Hatcher and Cho spar in Cho's dojo and Hatcher convinces him to speak to the lieutenant. Cho tells the lieutenant some of what he knows but is unwilling to help past a certain point, particularly since his gallery opens tomorrow. The lieutenant accidentally knocks over his coffee cup and CHo catches it before it hits the floor; without a drop of the coffee spilling out.Caifano calls Braden to give in. He'll meet Braden at the gallery in three hours with the money he promised Braden for delivery of the heroin. Cathy quietly picks up an extension phone from another room and eavesdrops on the conversation. But after Caifano hangs up, he tells two senior enforcers to go to the gallery and clean it out, bringing all the dolls to him, and to kill anyone who gets in the way.Braden goes to his chief enforcer, a huge burly Japanese man, and tells him not to let Cathy leave the house. He has Braden's permission to rough her up if she gives the enforcer trouble.Cho interrupts the robbery and attacks the men, punching their noses and kicking their nuts until they run to the van and try to drive off. Leaping tall fences at a single bound, Cho catches the van and does an acrobatic maneuver to smash through the windshield with barely a few cuts. He picks up the fight and kills all but one thug who fires at him with a revolver. Cho dodges the bullets as only a ninja with twice the speed of Batman can, and grabs onto the van as the thug drives away. Cho is dragged along the street, fighting to climb back into the van until the rear door breaks off and the last thug gets away with all the goods.The gallery phone rings. Cathy is trying to call, but the burly enforcer makes her hang up.Braden arrives at the gallery in full ninja regalia. Cho's mother hears him from the upstairs apartment. Braden sees all the dolls are missing and that Caifano has double-crossed him. He tries to quietly sneak back out when Cho's mother attacks him. They square off and she tries to throw a knife at him, but he catches it and throws it back, wounding her. She blows several darts to take him off balance and then vanishes with the aid of a smoke bomb. But Braden knows which wall she's disappeared behind and stabs through it with his ninja sword, killing her. He unmasks just in time for Kane, arriving home, to see him. Braden spots Kane but doesn't catch him.Cho arrives back home and finds his mother slain by a ninja sword. He grieves as he takes her medallion, the most precious heirloom of the family. Later, the police arrive and the lieutenant says he's put a missing child bulletin out on Kane, but Cho says that Kane is smart enough to hide and not return home until he must. Cho still declines to help the lieutenant with the police investigation.The burly enforcer tries to rape Cathy but is garotted to death by Braden. Knowing the connection between Cathy and Kane, Braden hypnotizes her and commands her to bring to Kane to him when she sees him.Hatcher goes to Cho with information on some ex-cons who might have information on the stolen dolls. The ex-cons laugh mockingly until Hatcher and Cho bust their heads, landing a gazillion bone-shattering punches to the points of their noses and nuts in the space of a single micro-milli-nano-second until the ex-cons squeal like little school girls.Kane finally comes home to find Cathy working out and practicing at the family dojo. Kane instantly senses something wrong with Cathy. She tries to grab him but he beats her up, holding her at spearpoint. But Kane doesn't want to kill Cathy and starts to walk away, giving Cathy the opportunity to scoop Kane up over her shoulder like a sack of potatoes and carry him off.Back at Braden's, Cathy has recovered her senses and is again protective of Kane, but Braden smacks her upside her head and tells one of his goons to 'get rid' of Kane. He calls Caifano and tells him that he's coming for him. Caifano gathers his entire entourage of underlings and enforcers who are all armed with military-grade weapons.Thinking Braden has gone, Cathy calls Cho, who has just arrived back at the gallery with Hatcher. Cathy rats Braden out to Cho, telling him that Braden used the gallery as a front for heroin smuggling, and that Braden is a ninja who hypnotized her into bringing Kane to him. Braden catches Cathy in the act and grabs her.Hatcher offers to help Cho and bring in the police, but Cho declines.

Once the capability of tapping into ""higher brain functions"" is added in, and you can actually jump into someone else's head and play back recordings of what he or she was thinking, feeling, seeing, etc., at the time of the recording, the applications of the project quickly spiral out of control.

He hires a professional photographer, promising him a $1,000 ""finder's fee"" if she is offered a contract by Playboy magazine. Paul also hires a second photographer, offering the same terms, and awards him the fee. The photos get into the attention of Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner (Cliff Robertson) who invites Dorothy to audition in Los Angeles, California, but when her mother refuses to sign the parental consent form, Paul forges her signature.After passing the audition, Dorothy is told that she will be featured as the ""centerfold"" in the magazine's August 1979 issue. With Hugh Hefner's help, Dorothy secures a job at the local Playboy Club and moves into her own apartment.Back in Vancouver, Paul has a tryst with an exotic dancer, who suggests that Dorothy may also be having affairs. Fearful of losing her, Paul telephones Dorothy and proposes marriage. He flies to Los Angeles and accompanies her to a party at the Playboy mansion, where he quickly alienates Hugh Hefner with his sycophantic behavior. Dorothy is introduced to film producer Phil Wass, who offers her a small role in the low-budget production, 'Ball Bearings'. When Dorothy informs Hefner of her impending marriage, he advises against it, saying Paul has ""the personality of a pimp."" Although Dorothy proceeds with the marriage, Hefner keeps her under contract and sends her on a personal appearance tour.Paul earns a modest living producing a nightclub act comprised of male exotic dancers, while Dorothy appears in another low-budget film, 'Wednesday's Child'. Paul interrupts the production with a telephone call, and convinces Dorothy to finance his purchases of an expensive Mercedes-Benz sedan, promising to adorn it with a custom license plate that reads, ""Star 80."" Unable to afford a home of their own, Paul and Dorothy share a rented house with a young doctor named Geb (David Clennon), who notices Dorothy's growing disillusionment with Paul.Certain that Dorothy has a bright future as an actress, Hefner convinces acclaimed film director Aram Nicholas (Roger Rees) (loosely based on film director Peter Bogdanovich) to cast her in his next picture, to be filmed in New York City. Dorothy worries that Paul will resent her extended absence, but Paul is more concerned with maintaining Dorothy's celebrity status and gives his consent. Once production is underway, however, Paul suspects Dorothy of sleeping with Aram Nicholas, and hires a private detective (Josh Mostel) to spy on her.Meanwhile, Paul continues to have affairs of his own with other women, such as Billie Joan Worth, whom he seduces with the promise of an audition for Hugh Hefner. Exasperated by Paul's nightly telephone calls, Dorothy complains to Aram about her husband's controlling behavior and constant need for validation. The director convinces her to end the marriage, and then seduces her.In Los Angeles, the private detective informs Paul of the affair, advising him to sue Aram for alienation of affection. Paul purchases a pump-action shotgun, and wallpapers his bedroom with photographs of him and Dorothy. Geb and his girl friend, Robin, notice Paul's increasingly erratic behavior, and worry that he may attempt suicide.Upon her return to Los Angeles, Dorothy admits her affair with Aram, but promises Paul continued financial support, while ignoring his pleas to save their marriage. Dorothy agrees to a second meeting with Paul, despite Aram's advice to avoid him. The private detective equips Paul with a transmitter to wear during the meeting, enabling them to gather evidence for a lawsuit. When the transmitter fails to work, Paul decides to keep his appointment with Dorothy, confident that he and his estranged wife will reconcile.The following afternoon, Dorothy arrives at Paul's house and promises him $7,000, half of her savings. Paul is insulted by the offer, and threatens to shoot himself after Dorothy refuses to continue their business relationship. When she tries to comfort him, Paul alternately becomes enraged and apologetic. Dorothy offers herself to Paul and they have rough sex, even though he resents her pity. Afterward, Paul places the shotgun to Dorothy's head and fires, killing her.Meanwhile, the private detective attempts to reach Paul by telephone but gets no reply as Paul will not pick up the phone. Paul, shocked by his actions of killing Dorothy, proceeds to sexually molest her dead body (off-camera).At the same time, Aram edits his film.Elsewhere, Hugh Hefner considers Billie Joan Worth as a candidate for a Playboy centerfold.Back at the apartment, the distraught Paul places the shotgun to his own head, and says, ""They won't forget Paul Snider,"" before pulling the trigger, killing himself."

Lonnegan is planning to get back at Gondorff and Hooker for bilking him out of half a million. At the same time Gondorff and Hooker are planning their next caper. And their mark is a man named Macalinski, who makes Lonnegan look like a pussycat. Their con is boxing match and Hooker is the fighter whom they have to make look good but Macalinski needs some convincing, and Hooker is a little rusty.—<rcs0411@yahoo.com> Hooker and Gondorff pull a con on Macalinski, an especially nasty mob boss with the help of Veronica, a new grifter. They convince this new victim that Hooker is a somewhat dull boxer who is tired of taking dives for Gondorff. There is a ringer. Lonnegan, their victim from the first movie, is setting them up to take the fall.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> In 1940 New York City, a man known as Kid Colors (Burt Remsen) is tortured and killed as retribution for his role in swindling $500,000 from Doyle Lonnegan (Oliver Reed), a crooked banker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His lead henchman, Carlos (Jose Perez), spreads the rumor that Brooklyn, New York, nightclub owner and pimp Gus Macalinski (Karl Malden), known as ""the Wolf"" for his reputation as a womanizer, is responsible for the Kid's killing, while Lonnegan plans the murder of confidence man Jake Hooker.Elsewhere in the city, con artist Jake Hooker (Mac Davis) and his friend, Eddie (Ron Rifkin), attempt to swindle Countess Veronique Le Fleur (Teri Garr) and her companion, Lady Dorsett (Frances Bergen), who turn the tables on them. Jake receives a telegram from his old con artist friend, Fargo Gondorff (Jackie Gleason), inviting him to Florida. After boarding the train, Jake and Eddie raise train fare by stealing off-duty police officer Francis O'Malley's wallet. Meanwhile, Carlos trails the two men and informs Lonnegan of their plans.After arriving in Miami, Florida, Jake and Eddie discover that Fargo is serving a two-year sentence in a federal prison and will be released within a few days. Fargo tells them about Kid Color's murder, placing blame on Gus Macalinski. A few days later, the three men return to New York City and meet with business associates ""Handicap,"" (Larry Hankin) ""Big Ohio,"" (Michael D. Alldredge) ""Doc Brown,"" (John Hancock) and ""Tuxedo"" in the back room of a Chinese laundry, where they concoct a ""sting"" to cheat Macalinski out of a fortune. While Fargo establishes headquarters at Golding's gymnasium, Jake purchases boxing equipment at a department store, where he encounters Countess Veronique Le Fleur. Jake accuses her of being a pickpocket and alerts the store manager, who discovers O'Malley's wallet in the countess's handbag, and her coin purse in Jake's pocket. After both are ejected from the store, the countess introduces herself as Veronica Sherman... a con artist herself. Jake is sufficiently impressed with her skills and offers her a job as a member of the team to exploit Macalinski's weakness for the opposite sex.The next day at Golding's Gym, Jake receives his boxing license and his alias, Bobby Florian. He tells Fargo about Veronica, sheepishly revealing that she ""reverse conned"" him two weeks earlier. At Fargo's urging, Veronica admits to her real surname, Crinklaw. The next evening, she enters Macalinski's Ocean Club and draws the owner to her table. Fargo appears within seconds and introduces himself as Trevor Plantagenet. Veronica, who calls herself Elizabeth Windsor, pretends to be enamored with Fargo. He opens a bottle of champagne and the spray removes Macalinski's toupee. Attempting to overcome his humiliation, Macalinski challenges Fargo to a game of pool, then to a game of Three Card Monte. Fargo wins both, and Macalinski leaves the club in a fit of anger.Outside, Jake tells Macalinski he has information on ""Trevor Plantagenet."" Macalinski invites Jake, posing as ""Bobby,"" to join him for a roller coaster ride. As the coaster speeds along the track, Jake explains that Fargo is his manager, and wants him to intentionally lose his upcoming fight against boxer Chico Torres. Jake intends to win the fight, and asks Macalinski for protection against a reprisal from Fargo in exchange for half of the $6,000 prize. After Macalinski promises to consider the offer, Jake encounters O'Malley. He eludes the officer and takes refuge in the Chinese laundry, where Fargo and his team are waiting for him. Fargo assures Jake that Macalinski will accept the offer, and advises him stay in hiding to avoid O'Malley. When Carlos updates Lonnegan on Jake's activities, the banker happily anticipates the murder of his adversaries by Macalinski.Meanwhile, Jake trains with Big Ohio, but shows little promise. However, when Macalinski visits the gym, they stage a sparring match and Jake knocks Big Ohio out of the ring. That evening, Jake informs Macalinski that Fargo is betting on Torres, and has arranged with bookmaker Tuxedo to increase the odds of Jake winning to attract more bets. Though Macalinski is intrigued, he refuses to commit until he sees Jake fight a professional boxer, which he arranges for the following day at the 8th Street Gymnasium. Jake leaves the meeting and evades O'Malley a second time. Carlos intercepts the policeman and takes him to see Lonnegan, who pays O'Malley to leave Jake alone until the sting is completed.After learning of Jake's dilemma, Fargo devises a plan to evacuate the gym, staff it with his own people, and drug Jake's competitor. When Jake wins, Macalinski agrees to protect him, and places a $400,000 bet with Tuxedo. Jake returns to Golding's and has a romantic interlude with Veronica. Confident of a victory by Torres, Lonnegan bets $1 million with a bookmaker named King Rafferty. Lonnegan directs O'Malley to the Chinese laundry, where he is expected to kill Jake and Fargo if Macalinski fails. The banker also introduces O'Malley to his informant, Samantha Scanlon, alias Veronica Crinklaw.On the night of the boxing match, Fargo instructs Jake to feign defeat in the sixth round, although Jake doubts he will last that long. While the fight is underway, Lonnegan informs Macalinski that Torres is the predetermined winner. On their boss's instructions, Macalinski's thugs reassign the bet to Torres and bring Tuxedo to the stadium at gunpoint. Believing their friend's life is in danger, Fargo instructs Jake to knock out Torres in the sixth round. Jake wins, despite his self-doubt, and is equally puzzled by Veronica's sudden absence. Fearing revenge from Macalinski, Lonnegan and Carlos run from the stadium, only to be ambushed in their car. O'Malley leads a police raid on the Chinese laundry and is greeted by a messenger, who delivers a bouquet of flowers and a derisive message from Fargo.On their way to the train station, Fargo explains that he hired Veronica to infiltrate Lonnegan's gang several months earlier. King Rafferty and Torres are also members of the organization. Fargo and his team board a westbound train, but Jake waits on the platform, hoping for Veronica's arrival. Moments after leaving the station, the train stops and Veronica disembarks. She tells Jake that she will be taking care of him from now on, as instructed by her father, Fargo."
Amityville 3-D,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085159/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A reporter moves into the Amityville house in defiance of the supernatural events connected to it, and finds everyone around him besieged by the evil manifestations which are connected to a demonic presence in the basement. Convinced that the horrible rumours about the bloody DeFeo murders and the evil Amityville House are nothing but an elaborate hoax, the inquisitive Reveal Magazine journalist, John Baxter, decides to buy it as an investment. Now, as troubling supernatural incidents and death stain the new residence, John stubbornly insists to remain apathetic, even after yet another tragedy sends his ex-wife, Nancy, one step before madness. However, an ancient evil lies at the root of the problem.

While preparing the house for John, Clifford goes into it alone and, hearing footsteps in the attic, goes upstairs to investigate and is locked in the room, where he is swarmed by flies and is found dead of a presumed heart attack or stroke by John. Thinking nothing of Clifford's death, even after Melanie shows him some photos she took of the real estate agent before his death which depict him as a rotting corpse, John moves into the house and lives there, adamant that the house is normal and telling Melanie to later meet him there.While John works (and experiences elevator trouble presumably caused by the house from afar) Melanie goes to the house and makes her way inside, eventually finding the maid and is spooked; the maid leaves shortly afterward. Left alone, Melanie goes down into the basement to check the fuse box when she feels a strange breeze; frightened, she heads back upstairs when the door to the basement flies open on its own and blasts her with an Arctic gale. She is found later that night by John, cowering and hysterical against the wall.Her attempts to convince John that something is inside the house falls on deaf ears. Later, while looking over blowups of the photos of Clifford, Melanie discovers a demonic-looking face in the pictures and rushes to reach John, but crashes her car and dies when the photographs burst into flames and burn her to a charred skeleton, the car going up in flames shortly afterward. Melanie's death is ruled accidental by everyone, including John, who remains oblivious to the evil in his home.While John is away one day his daughter Susan (Lori Loughlin) and her friend Lisa (Meg Ryan) (who is obsessed with the history of the house, claiming it was built on an Indian burial ground) take some boys to the house and use a Ouija board in the attic, but stop the game when the board tells them Susan is in danger before the glass they were using smashes itself against the wall.

Growing bored, Susan and the others go out in John's motorboat while Susan's mother Nancy (Tess Harper) searches the house for her daughter, who walks in the door drenched moments later. After Nancy calls out at her, Susan turns and smiles at her, then ignores Nancy and makes her way upstairs, locking herself in her room. Outside John arrives with groceries and, seeing a commotion on the docks, goes to see what is wrong and finds Susan's lifeless body being tended to, her friends telling him she fell out of the boat.When Nancy arrives at the scene John tells her what happened, causing Nancy to go into hysterics and tell him she saw Susan in the house moments ago before rushing back inside, convinced Susan is either still there or will be shortly, refusing to leave, even for Susan's funeral.After having nightmares about the old well in the basement (a supposed gateway to Hell) John, unable to deal with Nancy's delusions that Susan is still alive, consults his friend Doctor Elliot West (Robert Joy) about what he should do. West suggests that John allow him and a team of paranormal investigators to set up in the house, to help prove if Nancy actually saw something or not, which John agrees to.As Elliot, John and the team wait, Nancy sits by Susan's bed and is soon confronted by a spectral being speaking in Susan's voice, which goads her into following it into the basement, where the old well has filled with liquid. Following Nancy and the being, John and Elliot begin trying to goad whatever is in the well to reveal itself and let Susan (who they believe can come back) go. While near the well Elliot is burned and dragged into the depths by a demon and Susan's specter disappears as John and Nancy flee upstairs, telling Elliot's team to run.

During the rule of brutal right-wing military juntas in Paraguay and Argentina, half-English/half-Paraguayan medical doctor Eduardo Plarr returns from Buenos Aires to work in the small town of Corrientes, Argentina, where he first arrived after his escape from Paraguay years earlier. He quickly forms new friendships such as the one with the alcoholic British Honorary Consul, Charley Fortnum, whose beautiful Argentinian wife, former high-class prostitute Clara, Eduardo seduces and they have a passionate affair. He also re-establishes old ones like the one with the junta's Colonel Perez and Leon, a former priest turned rebel leader, who also happens to be Eduardo's childhood friend from Paraguay. All of this comes together to create a serious problem for Eduardo when he is asked to help the rebels kidnap the US ambassador, who's coming to visit Corrientes and whose kidnapping might force the US to force the Paraguayan junta to release several political prisoners, including Eduardo's father who may or may not still be alive.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Dr. Eduardo Plarr is a medical doctor with a Paraguayan deceased mother and an English anti-junta revolutionary father, possibly still alive but imprisoned in Paraguay, who lives in Argentina during the country's so-called Dirty War.

When he later returns to the whorehouse to find her, he learns that the prostitute, Clara, left the place for good. Some time later, Charley calls him to examine his wife, and when Eduard arrives, he sees that Charley's wife is none other than Clara. One day, Eduardo meets her by chance in a store and buys her an expensive pair of sunglasses. Clara goes with him to his apartment and they begin a love affair. When Clara becomes pregnant by Eduardo, Charley believes that the baby is his. Meanwhile Eduardo's childhood friend from Paraguay, Leon, visits him in his office and tells him that his father is still alive in prison in Paraguay.

What will Eduardo do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in a small politically unstable Latin American country, the story follows half-English/half-Latin doctor Eduardo Plarr (Richard Gere), who left his home to find a better life. Along the way, he meets an array of people, including the British Consul Charley Fortnum (Michael Caine), a representative in Latin America who is trying to keep a revolution from occurring, who is also a remorseful alcoholic. Another person the doctor meets is Clara (Elpidia Carrillo), whom he immediately desires, but there is a problem: Clara is Charley's wife. Dr. Eduardo Plarr has lived in Argentina since he was a youth after he and his Paraguayan mother fled Paraguay when his British father was captured by the Paraguayan junta and held as a political prisoner, where he remains.

This turns into a passionate affair and makes Carla realizes that while she does love her husband, who is rather affectionate towards her, she also enjoys Eduardo's raw sexuality and a more passionate form of affection that her husband can not offer, since alcoholism and depression basically killed all of his potency, sex appeal and passion for living. Eduardo also re-establishes old friendships with Argentinian junta's Colonel Perez and Leon, a former priest turned rebel leader, who also happens to be Eduardo's childhood friend from Paraguay turned makeshift rebel leader.All of this comes together to create a serious problem for Eduardo when he is asked to help the rebels kidnap the US Ambassador, who's coming to visit Corrientes and whose kidnapping might force the US to force the Paraguayan junta that's receiving financial aid from the US to release several key political prisoners, including Eduardo's father who may or may not still be alive.Eduardo helps the rebels by getting information about the ambassadors route from Charley, but the amateurish rebels kidnap Charley instead of the ambassador by mistake and hide near Corrientes, that happens to lie near the border between Paraguay and Argentina.Eduardo becomes conflicted over whether or not to help incompetent Charley, since the Consul is not really that bad of a guy and Eduardo really is his only chance, since even the British Ambassador himself had already given up on him by openly stating that Charley is simply too small of a fish for anyone from the UK government, let alone the US, to actually bother rescuing him. On the other hand, if Eduardo simply washes his hands from the whole affair as well and let the rebels kill him, he gets to stay with Carla, who after so many passionate trysts with Eduardo actually got pregnant by him, even though everyone, including Charley, believe that the child is in fact Charley's. The only one who knows better is Perez, who shows to Eduardo that he's deeply concerned by all this and warns Eduardo not to get involved or he will have to kill him.Perez also finally reveals to Eduardo that his father is long dead, killed by the Paraguayan military during his escape attempt. Meanwhile, the rebels shoot Charley during his escape attempt but only graze him. Eduardo arrives to check up on him and Charley discovers both that Eduardo was involved in his kidnapping and that he's not the father of Clara's child. Perez, who followed Charley, surrounds the house where Charley is kept and gives everyone inside a ten minute deadline to surrender.Eduardo makes peace with Charley and goes outside to negotiate with Perez. The soldiers immediately shoot Eduardo. Leon goes to help him only to get shot himself. In desperation, the rest of the group tries killing Charley, but Perez's men take them down. Charley is rescued, only to witness Perez personally shooting wounded Eduardo in the head, execution style, just like Eduardo's father was killed.Charley is safely returned home where he makes up with Carla, agrees to be the father of her child and they decide to name her and Eduardo's child Eduardo instead of Charley."

The Egyptian vampire lady Miriam (Catherine Deneuve) subsists upon the blood of her lovers. In return, the guys or girls don't age until Miriam has had enough of them.

In her very public work, she is approached by among others a seductively beautiful blond woman who attends one of Sarah's book signings, and John Blaylock (David Bowie), who claims he has just started suffering from advanced aging. She initially believes John is the next in a long line of crackpots she's encountered, that is until she sees how much he has aged in the few hours he has waited to speak to her. It isn't until she goes looking for John after the fact that she finds out that the blond woman is Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve), John's wife. What Sarah does not know is that Miriam is a vampire queen, she who promises eternal youth and life to who started as her mortal lovers as she injects them with her blood with her bite. John is the latest in those lovers, he who has been with her for centuries. Her promise, however, is not altogether true as her lovers do end up aging exponentially once she discards them from her favor, after which they are doomed to an eternity of human life in an always aging and decrepit body. Sarah returns to the Blaylock home both to investigate further John's situation, but also in her mutual attraction to Miriam. As such, she may end up the next in the long line of Miriam's vampire lovers who will also eventually be doomed to a life of eternal aging.—Huggo Miriam Blaylock is the last of a race of vampires who has lived for thousands of years, feeding off the blood of unsuspecting victims.

John, who is aware of her previous lovers over the centuries and their ultimate fates of sudden aging, discovers that he has himself suddenly begun to age. Desperately he seeks help from geriatrics researcher Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), who finds herself caught in Miriam's spell.—Anonymous The film opens in a New York night club. The gothic rock band Bauhaus is onstage performing the song ""Bela Lugosi's Dead."" In the crowd are John and Miriam Blaylock (David Bowie,Catherine Deneuve). Stylishly dressed and predatory, they stalk the crowd and connect with a young couple (John Stephen Hill,Ann Magnuson). The couple takes them back to their home, where John and Miriam seduce them before viciously slashing their throats. John and Miriam are vampires, although not in any traditional sense; lacking fangs, they use ancient Egyptian pendants to cut open the jugulars of their victims.The center of their strange existence is Miriam. She is an immortal being, able to pass along her supernatural qualities to selected human beings that she chooses to be her lovers. However, her progeny are not truly immortal as she is, and sooner or later, usually after 300 years or so, they find themselves suddenly and rapidly getting old. However, the progeny are unable to die, but continue to live forever withered, in a fully conscious, vegetative state. Miriam packs their decaying, aging bodies in caskets that she keeps in the attic of her residence. In the 18th century, Miriam offered this gift of immortality to John, who eagerly accepted, as had all her previous lovers through the ages.Suddenly, John develops trouble sleeping, and starts aging at a rapid rate. Miriam is aware of the significance of this happening, and she goes looking for a famous gerontologist, Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), desperately seeking her help for a cure for John's fast deterioration. She makes contact with Dr. Roberts, and through her psychic powers, finds out that the doctor is just guessing, and that her research is inconclusive. Therefore, John, as all her lovers before him, is doomed to extinction. John also attempts to meet with Dr. Roberts at her clinic, but she dismisses his claims as delusional and leaves him to sit in the waiting room, hoping that he will grow bored and leave. John ages decades within a few short hours, and when Sarah sees him later, she begs John to stay so she can examine him. But John refuses to speak to her, his hunger for blood nearly overpowering him and forcing him to leave in search of a victim.Driven by his bloodlust and desperation to reverse the aging process, John makes a kill out of young Alice (Beth Ehlers), a music student that he and Miriam are tutoring. Her blood does nothing to help John, and he eventually falls down a flight of stairs at the townhouse, his legs no longer able to support his own weight. Miriam carries John's withering body up to the attic and puts him in a casket, next to several other caskets containing her earlier lovers.Later on, when Dr. Roberts shows up at Miriam's door looking for John, Miriam sees in the doctor a replacement for John in her life; it is love at first sight for Miriam, and she immediately proceeds to seduce Sarah. Sarah is a willing participant in Miriam's seduction, but she doesn't know that Miriam has now transformed her into a vampire, just as she did to John and her other lovers.Lieutenant Allegrezza (Dan Hedaya) shows up at Miriam's house looking for Alice, and is immediately suspicious of Miriam, although he has no real proof of any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Sarah begins to manifest symptoms of vampirism. She is ravenously hungry, but eating normal food makes her vomit. She also starts seeing Miriam everywhere she looks. Finally she confronts Miriam about what happened between them on that day, and Miriam vaguely states that she has given Sarah eternal life, and that they belong to one another now. Sarah rejects what Miriam has told her, but she does understand that something terrible has happened to her. Sarah and her partners at the clinic, including Sarah's boyfriend, Tom Haver (Cliff De Young), cannot find a cure for the change that is occurring in Sarah's blood, and in desperation Sarah returns to Miriam. Miriam arranges for Sarah to make her first kill, bringing back a male prostitute, but Sarah is unwilling to take a human life.Finally, Tom arrives at the townhouse looking for Sarah following her disappearance, and is surprised to find that Sarah is there. Miriam knows that Sarah's hunger is now beyond reason, and when she takes Tom to Sarah, Sarah kills him for his blood. Miriam is now convinced that she has found her new lover, and she tells Sarah that they will now share an eternity together. Sarah, however, is wracked with guilt over taking Tom's life, and she attempts suicide by cutting her own throat with Miriam's ankh as they kiss. Sarah's blood pours into Miriam's throat and then Sarah collapses. Miriam is horrified at what Sarah has done, but she dutifully carries Sarah's limp body into the attic to place her among her other desiccated lovers. This time, however, she finds her crumbling lovers now out of their coffins, waiting for her. The sudden intake of Sarah's blood has caused a change in Miriam.

Local Hero,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085859/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American oil company has plans for a new refinery and sends someone to Scotland to buy up an entire village, but things don't go as expected. Oil billionaire Happer sends Mac to a remote Scottish village to secure the property rights for an oil refinery they want to build. Mac teams up with Danny and starts the negotiations, the locals are keen to get their hands on the 'Silver Dollar' and can't believe their luck. However, a local hermit and beach scavenger, Ben Knox, lives in a shack on the crucial beach which he also owns. Happer is more interested in the Northern Lights and Danny in a surreal girl with webbed feet, Marina. Mac is used to a Houston office with fax machines but is forced to negotiate on Bens terms.—Matthew Stanfield <mattst@cogs.susx.ac.uk> A US oil company intends building a large oil refinery in Scotland. To do so it will need to buy an entire town. The company sends a young, aggressive executive to Scotland to negotiate with the locals. Things go smoothly until the owner of a particular piece of land, vital to the plan, refuses to sell.—grantss Felix Happer, in an unusual form of therapy with a fellow named Moritz, is the eccentric owner/president of the Houston-based conglomerate Knox Industries, his family which bought it from the Knox family over half a century ago, they never having bothered to change the name. Knox Oil and Gas, a division of the company, decides to build a refinery on the northern Scottish coast, Mac - short for his surname MacIntyre - from the Acquisitions Department, assigned to acquire the property, namely the entire town of Ferness. He is given the job in the company's mistaken belief that he is Scottish - he truly Hungarian - and thus can talk the language of the locals. That assignment includes going to Ferness to conduct the negotiations in person instead of his generally preferred method of doing business from Houston via telephone and telex. He will have some ""local"" assistance in the form of Danny Oldsen, who works for Knox Oil and Gas in their Aberdeen office. In dealing with Gordon Urquhart, the local innkeeper with an accounting business on the side, he who has been chosen to negotiate on behalf of the town, Mac is unaware of the residents' secret agenda, they a quirky lot. In the process, both Mac and Danny get sidetracked in the dealings, Danny's new focus being his pursuit of Marina, a researcher working in Knox's Aberdeen laboratory, she who feels more comfortable in the water than on land and who mistakenly believes that Knox's want for the land is to build her dream of a new marine institute. Things become even more complex with the introduction of three others into the proceedings: Victor, a capitalist Soviet fisherman who is on his regular pilgrimage to Ferness; Ben, a local who lives on the beach and who has a different stake in what happens than most of the other residents; and Happer himself who has come to Ferness for his passion project on which Mac was supposed to dedicate his spare time while in Ferness.—Huggo"

Smokey and the Bandit Part 3,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086325/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Big and Little Enos are opening a sea food restaurant. They bet Sheriff Buford T. Justice that he cannot drive from Miami to the Enos ranch in Texas in a given amount of time. If Buford loses he has to give up his badge. Big Enos and Little Enos have opened a seafood restaurant and want to promote it in their usual fashion. The Bandit is unavailable this time, though, so they enlist Buford. ""Trigger"" is brought out of mothballs, a large fish is strapped to the roof of the car, and the new Bandit is on his way on another wild cross-country run. But where there is the Bandit, there is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.—Jason A. Cormier <wildrose@mindspring.com> As is the case with the two preceding 'Smokey and the Bandit' films, Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 begins with Big Enos (Pat McCormick) and Little Enos (Paul Williams) offering a sizeable wager on one's ability to transport a shipment a large distance in a short period of time. Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting $250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus ""Snowman"" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a ""bookkeeper"" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his $250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Not long after the local officer is disabled, Buford becomes disabled as well when sand is dumped on his squad car.The pursuit quickly resumes as Buford catches up to the duo after Cledus and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to pick up some food. The chase resumes as they enter a local town, where mass chaos comes with their entry. Cledus escapes when an 18 wheeler blocks the alleyway where Cletus run through. While trying to get the truck out, Buford's car is hitched to a tow-truck. After unsuccessfully pleading with the traffic officer to release his car, he sends his son Junior (Mike Henry) out to unhook it. Unable to wait, he angrily reverses the car and escapes. The tow truck operator chases him in pursuit, with Junior dangling on the hook, spinning freely. Eventually, Buford manages to make the truck flip over, sending the truck and Junior flying. A number of cars continue to crash into the pile-up. The next scene comes sudden as the Bandit and Justice are in the Mississippi fairgrounds. Buford continues to pursue on two wheels after driving on an incline with Cledus letting the fame get to his head.Cledus and Dusty decide to stop at a hotel for the night, which contains people who are involved in ""sexual"" acts, several of which are quite deviant. Buford finds the Bandit's Trans Am and decides to make a search of the building to find the fish, which he eventually does. While searching in the steamroom, Buford handcuffs himself to a muscular nymphomaniac female who will not take no for an answer.The next final scenes show Buford getting his tires blown by the ""Enos Devil Darts."" Cledus quickly arrives and retakes the fish. Cledus and Justice then start a final pursuit with Buford on two tires, first through a bunch of cattle, then to boats, then finally through a field where the Enoses set off a series of explosives, one of which destroys all of the bodywork, leaving the engine, seats, and police light bar (being held by Junior above his head). Cledus decides to surrender the fish to let Buford win. Just after cashing in on the $250,000, Buford finds Cledus and begins to apprehend him, but Buford then imagines Cledus to be the ""Real"" Bandit (in a cameo appearance by Burt Reynolds) who sweet talks him to letting him go and starting a new pursuit. Similar to the ending of the 1977 movie, Buford is again chasing the Bandit in the hulk of his police cruiser (the muscular female has taken Junior's place riding shotgun this time), while Junior chases after ""Daddy"" for miles on end, dropping the reward money as he goes."

The Star Chamber,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086356/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Frustrated with a legal system gone haywire, a secret society of judges hires hitmen to snuff out criminals who escape courtroom justice - but one young judge questions the ethics of their vigilante system. Disgusted with criminals escaping the judicial system via technicalities, an idealistic young judge investigates an alternative method for punishing the guilty.—<bentley@access.digex.net> Judge Stephen Hardin finds himself distraught when he's forced to dismiss the charges against an obviously guilty criminal due to a legal technicality. Judge Ben Caufield, sensing Hardin's distress, informs him that a secret organization of judges has been meeting and hiring a hitman to kill other criminals who have similarly gotten off the hook. Caufield invites Hardin to join the organization. Hardin proceeds to wrestle with his conscience, especially when he presides over the trial of two obviously guilty child molesters/murderers...—Afterburner <aburner@erols.com> On a South Los Angeles, California, street, two plainclothes detectives chase Hector Andujar, a Latino man, who fits the description of the killer of several elderly women. During the pursuit, Andujar throws something in a garbage can and escapes but the detectives can't search the can without a warrant; the law only allows police to rummage through trash once it's been removed from a trash container and mixed in with the other trash in a sanitation truck. However, the police make the procedural error of searching Andujar's trash in the truck before it is combined with the rest of the truck's trash. Before leaving the scene, detective Kenneth Wiggan (Larry Hankin) finds a gun.Later, in the courtroom of Superior Judge Steven R. Hardin (Michael Douglas), Andujar's attorney asks that all evidence in the case be declared inadmissible because the detectives violated his client's right to privacy by not waiting until Andujar's garbage was mixed with the rest of the garbage in the truck to do a search. The trial ends with Andujar free because of a technicality despite overwhelming evidence against him.At a Chinese restaurant, Hardin complains to Benjamin Caulfield (Hal Holbrook), his former law professor and fellow judge, that the law has become too distorted for justice to prevail. Caulfield confesses that he's done something about it but refuses to explain.Sometime later, the police, along with Detective Harry Lowes (Yaphet Kotto), uncover the grisly murder of ten-year-old Daniel Lewin in the park. Nearby, Officer Pickett and Officer Nelson (David Proval) stop a van that has two outstanding warrants and notice that two thugs inside, Lawrence Monk (Don Calfa) and Arthur Cooms (Joe Regalbuto), are nervous. Pickett detects marijuana and instructs his partner, Nelson, to search the van. When Nelson sees a bloodied boy's sneaker in the rear of the vehicle, Monk and Cooms are arrested and later tried for the murder of Lewin.The boy's death is thought to be the work of a child pornography ring that kidnaps, drugs, films and then kills children. However, in Hardin's court, the case unravels because the city is behind on its record-keeping. The public defender argues that the police arrested Monk based on erroneous information and deems the search of their vehicle illegal and asks that the case be dismissed. As the court adjourns, Dr. Harold Lewin (James B. Sikking), Danny's father, reminds Hardin that his son has been gruesomely murdered by shoving his son's school photograph in the judge's coat pocket.
The next day, the case is thrown out of court and when Lewin attempts to shoot the freed killers, he is arrested.Later, at a baseball game, Hardin asks Caulfield to explain what he meant about overcoming the problems of convicting felons. Caulfield says he will soon offer an explanation but he refuses to do so at the ballgame.Judge Hardin later visits Lewin in prison; the doctor is at peace because he tried to take the law into his own hands. When Hardin offers his help, Lewin reminds him that another boy has been found murdered in the same manner as his son and says that the Judge is at fault because the murderers are back on the street.In a fury, Hardin drives to Caulfield's house, where he learns about ""the court of last resort,"" a secret group of nine judges that hand out ""real"" justice for the most perverted cases in the court system. According to Caulfield, Hardin has one of two choices; he can go back to his career on the bench or he can get his hands dirty by joining the secret court. Hardin and a panel of judges then listen to cases in the privacy of Caulfield's study and a hired killer is contracted to enforce the court's decisions.At home, Hardin gets a phone call saying that Dr. Lewin has committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping drugs while in prison. Furious, Hardin brings Danny Lewin's case to the secret court, and the judges arrange the summary execution of Monk and Cooms.Meanwhile, the police capture Stanley Flowers (DeWayne Jessie), a well-known car thief. During his interrogation, Flowers reveals that a van he stole for three black men was returned with a boy's bloody sneaker inside.Elsewhere, Hardin and his wife, Emily (Sharon Gless), attend a political function and learn from a friend that the news has reported the arrest of three black men believed to be the child pornographers. Fearing that Monk and Cooms are innocent and will be wrongly punished, Hardin finds Caulfield at the party and demands an emergency secret court session that evening. Although, Caulfield says it won't be easy to gather all the judges so quickly, the meeting convenes and Hardin is adamant that their decision to execute Monks and Cooms be reversed but he learns the execution cannot be stopped.In an effort to find Monk and Cooms before the hit man, Hardin follows Lowes' directions to an abandoned warehouse, and confronts the men. When Hardin warns them that their lives are threatened, they don't believe him and beat him up. As Hardin runs for his life, he grabs a chemical-filled glass bottle and uses it to defend himself as he inches out of the room. However, Monk and Cooms lunge at Hardin, causing him to throw the bottle into the middle of the room. An explosion rips through the side of the building and all three men run down the stairs as the fire alarm sounds. Meanwhile, a police car pulls up to the abandoned warehouse. The thugs shoot at Hardin, but before they can kill him, the hired killer, who is disguised as a police officer, shoots Monk and Cooms dead. The executioner looks Hardin in the eye and cocks his rifle, but before he can fire, Lowes appears and shoots the killer dead.Later, the secret court continues in Caulfield's study but Hardin's seat is empty. Instead, he and Lowes sit in a patrol car outside the house, tape recording the proceedings as future evidence for a criminal investigation."
The Dresser,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085461/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Personal assistant Norman struggles to get deteriorating veteran actor Sir through a difficult performance of King Lear. In a touring Shakespearean theater group, a backstage hand, the dresser, Norman (Sir Tom Courtenay), is devoted to the brilliant but tyrannical head of the company. He struggles to support deteriorating star Sir (Albert Finney) as the company struggles to carry on during the London blitz. The pathos of his backstage efforts rival the pathos in the story of Lear and the Fool that is being presented on-stage, as the situation comes to a crisis.—xenophil It's the early 1940s Britain. Norman (Sir Tom Courtenay), a slight, timid man, has worked for sixteen years as the dresser for the lead actor in a Shakespearean theater troupe, his boss, who is referred to solely as Sir (Albert Finney). Beyond his official dressing duties, Norman, dedicated to Sir and his work, also unofficially acts as Sir's personal assistant/gopher, ego and morale booster, caregiver and confidante, all of these duties, despite Sir being married to the troupe's lead actress, he who ensures that Sir is ready to go on stage each night. Norman relieves the stress of his job by taking the frequent nip from a mickey always on his person, and always when he doesn't think anyone notices. The troupe is currently on a tour, performing a different Shakespearean play at each one night stop, but always with Sir in the lead, he who planned the schedule and plays to be performed. Sir dominates the troupe, wanting to place himself at the best light in comparison to the supporting players. Some of his fellow actors dislike Sir's attitude and behavior, especially Oxenby (Edward Fox), but they will all band together to ensure the best show is left on stage each night. Sir's ego has not diminished in relation to his declining abilities, he well past his prime. Those declining abilities are demonstrated at their latest stop in Bradford to perform King Lear, there where early in the day Sir suffers a nervous breakdown leading to him being checked into the local hospital. Sir checks himself out for the show to go on. Beyond the added fact of the troupe being down one cast or crew member since their last performance, Norman has an especially difficult task this evening in ensuring not only that Sir is ready by curtain time, but that he holds it together over the course of the performance. By the end of the evening, Norman will get a clearer picture of just where he stands in Sir's life.—Huggo ""The Dresser"" opens with a performance of ""Othello"" at a regional theater in England during the last days of World War Two. In the title role is an ageing, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as ""Sir"" (Albert Finney). He is of the old. bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory. As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they've made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this traveling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime.Waiting backstage is Norman (Tom Courtenay), who has been Sir's dresser for decades. Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate little man who knows Sir's every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir's servant. As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a handy little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket.Next we see the company hurrying to its next venue, a theater in the industrial town of Bradford where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of King Lear. The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through the train station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard the even the conductor to hold the train for Sir's arrival. But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding ""STOP....THAT....TRAIN!"" from the platform steps. The conductor, taken aback, does just that and Sir placidly leads his company aboard.Arriving in Bradford, however, we soon learn another source of Norman's anxiety, for it becomes obvious that Sir's mental capacities are rapidly fading. Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in the town square that lands Sir in the hospital. As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theater, disoriented and exhausted, saying he's checked himself out of the hospital. Norman ushers Sir theater's dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager's insistence that the show be canceled and insisting Sir will be ready to go on.The middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain. Sir's wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other. Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy. By the time Sir's wife, referred to only as ""Her Ladyship"" and who is playing Cordelia to her husband's Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role we learn he has performed 227 times.The curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear's courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman's distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance. Air raid sirens sound, signaling the possibility of an airstrike; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career.After the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down. Sir requests Norman to read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing. Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir's gracious thank yous to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians...but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally. About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he's been reading. Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening's brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir's writing thanking himself. But Norman's anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved. The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir's body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love."

Eddie and the Cruisers,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085475/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A television newswoman picks up the story of a 1960s rock band whose long-lost leader Eddie Wilson may still be alive, while searching for the missing tapes of the band's never-released album. They say rock 'n' roll never dies, but one dark night in 1964, Eddie Wilson's car went off a Jersey bridge with the troubled rock idol at the wheel. His body was never found despite a massive search. Twenty years after the lead singer of Eddie and the Cruisers disappeared, the band's songs are hotter than ever. And renewed interest in the band leads television reporter Maggie Foley to pursue a tantalizing mystery: What if Eddie is still alive? The circumstances surrounding his death are just shadowy enough to make it a distinct possibility, and someone (could it be Eddie?) has been ransacking the homes of the surviving band members in a desperate search for tapes of the group's visionary, never-released album. As Maggie interviews the former band members, the pieces of the puzzle becomes suitable - but only until still deeper mysteries begin to surface.—MGM/UA Home Video It's been close to eighteen years since the officially listed 1964 death of Eddie Wilson, the lead of the working class Jersey rock band Eddie and the Cruisers, which released only one albeit successful album before his death. That official listing of his death is despite Eddie's body never having been found. The remaining band members subsequently went their separate ways in Eddie being the band's nucleus, the surviving members not having spoken to each other since. Music journalist Maggie Foley, under the guise of doing a tribute to Eddie, is really searching for evidence of her speculation that Eddie faked his own death, his disappearance she believes having something to do with the Cruisers' final recording sessions, as the tapes from those final sessions were checked out of the record company library the day after Eddie's death never to been seen again. Maggie tries to contact most of the surviving members in conducting her investigation, each who has a differing opinion on what they would like to see in her story. Coinciding with it, some unknown party also seems to have renewed interest in the band, that party who the band members believes is also searching specifically for the tapes. Flashbacks also show the band's final few years starting with the time its pianist Frank Ridgeway joined, he the educated, sensitive poet outsider who was the catalyst, for good or bad, of many of the changes that occurred with the band, including he becoming the lyricist to Eddie's music writer of most of the band's songs.—Huggo"
Curse of the Pink Panther,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085384/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ensuing after the events of Clouseau's disappearance, his bosses at the Surete put a computer into service to elect a new shrewd detective, Sleigh, who turns up just as inept as Clouseau. Inspector Clouseau disappears, and the Surete wants the world's second best detective to look for him. However, Clouseau's enemy, Dreyfus, rigs the Surete's computer to select, instead, the world's worst detective, N.Y.P.D. Sergeant Clifton Sleigh. Sleigh obtusely bungles his way past assassins and corrupt officials as though he were Clouseau's American cousin.—<rth@ece.arizona.edu> When famed French detective Clouseau goes missing while searching for the Pink Panther diamond, his bosses at the Surete decide they need a detective like him to find him. So they use a computer to select that person. They decide to let Chief Inspector Dreyfus program the computer. But Dreyfus, fearing Clouseau's return, decides to rig the computer to select the opposite. And after doing that, the computer chooses Clifton Sleigh from New York City, and it turns out he is just as inept as Clouseau. When Dreyfus meets him, he can't help but wonder if the two men are related, and just like Clouseau, he wants him dead. Sleigh sets out to find Clouseau, but there are those who would like him not to find Clouseau, so they try to take him out, but like Clouseau, he manages to avoid getting harmed.—rcs0411@yahoo.com When the infamous Chief Inspector Clouseau disappears in his search for the glamorous Pink Panther diamond, Dreyfus is tasked with programming a Huxley 600 supercomputer to select another detective to find him. Fearing that the new detective will indeed find Clouseau, Dreyfus sabotages the computer to instead select the world's worst detective. This comes in the form of incompetent American detective Clifton Sleigh who, as expected, is every bit as bungling as the man he is looking for.—Alexander Dockins (Note: this is a direct sequel to Trail of the Pink Panther with most of the cast from the previous film)In Lugash, the fabled Pink Panther diamond is stolen by a man named Gino Rossi (Christopher Reich) (a replay of the opening scene in 'Trail of the Pink Panther') from a museum in the Middle Eastern country of Lugash. Rossi then offers it to Countess Chandra (Joanna Lumley) at her private spa on the island of Majorca. However, the sale is interrupted by Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the Sûreté, France's national police force. When Rossi takes aim at the inspector, Chandra shoots the thief dead and points her gun at the Inspector.The French government is shaken by the disappearance of its greatest detective, and assigns Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), aided by ""Aldous,"" the Huxley 600 super computer, to find a suitable candidate to solve the mystery. However, Dreyfus is overjoyed to be free of the dimwitted Clouseau and sabotages the computer, programming it to determine the world's least capable detective. Aldous selects Officer Clifton Sleigh (Ted Wass), a well-meaning but inept New York City policeman.In New York City, Clifton Sleigh is shown to bungle a sting operation when he dresses up as a woman to nab a purse snatcher, only to get accosted by a leering dirty old man, a pimp and a couple of prostitutes whom think that he's intruding on their turf, and falsely arrested by a pair of beat cops who think he's a prostitute while the purse snatcher steals another woman's purse right under everyone's nose. At the precinct, Clifton's beleaguered commander, Lieutenant Palmyra, is incredulous when he informs Clifton about his assignment to France, but gladly consigns the city's worst detective to the Sûreté.Meanwhile, a group of Mafia bosses celebrate their improved fortunes since Clouseau's disappearance, and their leader, Bruno (Robert Loggia), assures the inspector's permanent absence by hiring an assassin to kill Clifton before he leaves the U.S. However, Clifton proves to be a difficult target, and the gunman falls to his death while taking aim. Another killer awaits Clifton at the airport in Paris, but he trips and falls on his own knife.When Clifton enters Dreyfus's office to meet with him for the first time, he bumps into the desk, which pushes the inspector through the open window and into the concrete fishpond below two stories below. While Dreyfus recovers from his injuries as a result of a broken leg, Clifton breaks into Clouseau's apartment, now a museum dedicated to the detective, and is attacked by Cato (Burt Kwouk), Clouseau's manservant. Clifton defeats Cato, who refers the detective to Professor Auguste Balls (Harvey Korman), the creator of Clouseau's disguises and the last known person to see him alive. Clifton goes to the professor's shop, and though Balls has no information on Clouseau, he does offer the detective his latest invention, the Instant Companion, an inflatable, lifelike female doll. Another attempt on Clifton's life only stiffens his resolve, and he notifies Dreyfus that he will begin his investigation at the theft scene in Lugash.The President of Lugash, who has already spent the insurance money from the stolen diamond, is forewarned of Clifton's arrival and instructs his Secret Police to send the detective back to France before he can collect any evidence. From her private spa on the island of Majorca, Chandra follows Clifton's progress with amusement, and shares the news with Clouseau, whose face is obscured by bandages following plastic surgery.Clifton's next destination is Nice on the French Riviera, where he meets Sir Charles Litton (David Niven), his wife, Lady Simone Litton (Capucine), and Litton's newer, George (Robert Wagoner). The detective's clumsiness prompts the Littons to ask if he is related to Clouseau. Clifton denies any relation, recalling that the President of Lugash posed the same question. Sir Charles admits to being interrogated by Clouseau shortly after the robbery, but denies any guilt, along with the rumor that he is the brilliant jewel thief known as ""The Phantom,"" and that George is his successor. He then advises Clifton to continue his investigation in Valencia, Spain.In Spain, Clifton hires a taxicab to bring him to his hotel (driven by the same driver that reporter Marie Jouvet interacted with in the previous film), but soon discovers Bruno's henchmen in pursuit. After barely escaping with his life, Clifton evades the gangsters with the help of his Instant Companion, which creates the illusion of a young couple on vacation. However, a misplaced cigarette causes an air leak in the doll, and Clifton returns to his hotel to re-inflate his ""companion"" with a gas pipe, while he updates Dreyfus by telephone.Clifton survives the resulting explosion and travels to Valencia, where a fiesta is underway. Bruno's men continue their pursuit, but Clifton eludes them in the crowded streets and takes refuge in a nightclub, where he meets Juleta Shane (Leslie Ash), a young Englishwoman with an aptitude for martial arts. Together they subdue the gangsters and make their way back to the hotel, where Juleta tries to seduce Clifton. Meanwhile, Dreyfus observes the couple from a nearby window and telephones Valencia police chief Vichila, saying that Clifton is an impostor. When Juleta attempts to poison Clifton's drink, she is shot with a tranquilizer dart by an unseen assailant, and Vichila arrives moments later to arrest Clifton. The police chief informs Clifton that his companion is actually Julie Morgan, Countess Chandra's personal secretary. When a policeman unwittingly drinks the poisoned wine and falls dead in the streets, Clifton takes advantage of this to escape into a crowd of revelers. George drives past and offers the detective a ride to the Litton yacht.The next morning, Clifton joins the Littons as they sail to Majorca, while Chief Vichila advises Chandra to expect a visit from the detective. Unable to reach the spa from the coast, Clifton par-ascends over the structure, but is shot down by the wheelchair-bound Dreyfus, who is driven over a cliff by the gun's recoil. Unfazed by Clifton's crash-landing through her stained-glass ceiling, Chandra invites the detective to join her and her ""lover"" for a drink. Clifton is awe-struck by Clouseau's resemblance to actor Roger Moore (credited as Turk Thrust II), and overlooks the inspector's French accent and profound stupidity. Chandra convinces Clifton that Clouseau, under the alias of the late ""Gino Rossi,"" visited the spa a year earlier before traveling to Madrid for plastic surgery. Clifton notifies the Sûreté of his findings and returns to Paris.Meanwhile, Chandra and Clouseau open their safe to gaze at the Pink Panther, but find only a white glove in its place. ""Swine Phantom!"" says Clouseau/Roger Moore.At Sûreté headquarters, Dreyfus declares the case closed after determining (incorrectly) that Clouseau, posing as Rossi, stole the diamond. Relieved to have Clouseau out of his life, Dreyfus sets fire to the inspector's dossier, but the flames quickly engulf his desk, and Clifton comes to the rescue with a fire hose. The force of the water blasts the inspector through the open window and into the concrete fishpond below... again.In the final scene, on the Litton yacht, George admires the stolen Pink Panther diamond, while Sir Charles comments on the disappearance of his one white glove. Simone hints that she is continuing the legacy of ""The Phantom."" The three criminals then toast to their success.In a post-credits scene, the animated Pink Panther is shown stealing the Pink Panther jewel. Realizing it's heavy, he slips out of the shot and drops the diamond off-screen, shattering it; the credits roll shortly afterwards."

Yellowbeard,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086618/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After serving two decades in prison, Yellowbeard (Graham Chapman) breaks out determined to recover the treasure that he buried so long ago, alongside his son, old crew, and the British Navy. Yellowbeard (Graham Chapman), a pirate's pirate, is allowed to escape from prison to lead the authorities to his treasure. He finds that his wife neglected to tell him that they have a son, now 20 years old and--shame of shame!--an intellectual. The British Navy, Yellowbeard, his son, and members of Yellowbeard's old crew all go after the treasure.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> After spending 20 long years behind bars, the once-feared pirate Yellowbeard breathes once more the fresh air of freedom. Hell-bent on retrieving his immense hidden treasure, the grizzled buccaneer assembles his old gang of loyal brothers-in-arms and sets out on a dangerous mission to find it, with the aid of his reluctant son who wants nothing to do with his father's shady business. Now, Commander Clement and the entire British Royal Navy are hot on their trail. Can Captain Yellowbeard outsmart them, and a duo of opportunists, to get the gold?—Nick Riganas On a Spanish galleon in the year 1687, aristocrat El Nebuloso (Tommy Chong) and his second-in-command, El Segundo (Cheech Marin), abscond with a treasure chest intended for their king. A band of English pirates, led by the dreaded blonde-haired Yellowbeard (Graham Chapman), descend on the ship and seize the treasure. Although his boatswain, Moon (Peter Boyle), planned the attack, Yellowbeard refuses to share the treasure, and as he slams the chest shut, Moon's left hand is severed.Yellowbeard continues his reign of terror, killing more than 500 men, until a betrayal by Moon leads to his 20-year prison sentence for tax evasion in England. Despite years of rehabilitation and torture, Yellowbeard refuses to divulge the location of the treasure.In a jump-forward to 1707, during the final week of his incarceration, Yellowbeard is informed by his wife, Betty (Madeline Kahn), that they have a teenage son named Dan (Martin Hewitt). The pirate is horrified to learn that the boy was raised by Lord Percy Lambourn (Peter Cook) to be an intellectual and a gardener. Dan, however, is fascinated by the idea that his father is the most ruthless pirate of all time.Meanwhile, Commander Clement (Eric Idle) of the Royal Secret Service coerces Queen Anne (Peter Bull) to extend Yellowbeard's sentence an additional 140 years, hoping the pirate will escape and lead authorities to his treasure. As predicted, Yellowbeard breaks out of prison and makes his way to Betty's tavern in search of the treasure map. Betty reveals that she tattooed it onto Dan's head before destroying the original, and directs Yellowbeard to Lambourn Hall, where the boy lives with his mentor.On the advice of informant Harvey ""Blind"" Pew (John Cleese), Commander Clement follows Yellowbeard into the tavern, but the pirate evades him. Moon's henchman, Gilbert (Marty Feldman), questions Blind Pew about the location of the map, but the informant refuses to assist pirates.Yellowbeard confronts his son at Lambourn Hall, declaring that he needs to remove the boy's head. Dan asks to remain intact and join his father on the treasure hunt. They consult Dr. Ebenezer Gilpin (Michael Hordern), who advises Yellowbeard to pose as a scientist on a voyage of discovery. Gilpin, Dan, and Lord Lambourn sign on as traveling companions. Blind Pew listens outside the office and informs Commander Clement of the group's departure. Moon and Gilbert eliminate Blind Pew by locking him inside a shed full of explosives and detonating them.The next morning, while Yellowbeard wreaks havoc in a brothel, Moon and Gilbert infiltrate a group of sailors and take Dan, Lord Lambourn, and Dr. Gilpin aboard the battleship, Lady Edith. As the ship sets sail, Yellowbeard stows away in the hold, while Captain Hughes lectures the men of their duty in England's war against France. Certain that Yellowbeard is aboard, Moon organizes a mutiny and elects Dan the new captain. Dan places the ship on a course to Madagascar, but during the night, Yellowbeard takes the helm and guides it toward the West Indies.Guided by Yellowbeard's wife, Betty, Commander Clement pursues the Lady Edith. He flies the French flag on his ship to avoid suspicion, and inadvertently attracts cannon fire from the battleship, forcing him to retreat. When the crew of the Lady Edith sights an island, Yellowbeard jumps overboard and swims ashore.Meanwhile, in El Nebuloso's hilltop fortress, an underling named Verdugo demonstrates his latest torture device, designed to break every bone in the human body. To further intimidate victims, it is suspended on a walkway over a pool of acid, to which nothing is impervious except gold and jewels.As the crew arrive on shore, Dr. Gilpin consults the map on Dan's scalp and leads a small party to the other side of the island. El Segundo assumes the landing party is searching for Yellowbeard's treasure and rallies his troops against the invaders, taking Dan prisoner. The boy is placed in the torture device, but refuses to talk.El Nebuloso's daughter, Triola (Stacey Nelkin), begs Dan to lead her father to the treasure, ""for the grace and glory of God."" When Dan suggests that torture is inconsistent with Christian ideals, Triola explains her father's desire to expedite his victims' entry into heaven. After Dan and Triola declare their love for each other, he promises to find the treasure and return for her, although El Nebuloso may be killed in the process. The avaricious Triola voices her approval.Elsewhere in the castle, El Nebuloso instructs El Segundo to feign resistance as the invaders approach the castle, enabling him to trap their leaders in the torture chamber. Yellowbeard joins Dr. Gilpin and Lord Lambourn as they lead their men into the fortress. Although guards pretend to fall dead at their feet, Yellowbeard proceeds to dispatch all in his path, including El Segundo, who dies a highly dramatic death, and receives a round of applause from his men.Upon entering the torture chamber, Dan's comrades find El Nebuloso threatening the boy with a sword. Yellowbeard swings from a rope and pushes the despot into the acid. Triola enters as Dan is set free, and she is happy to learn that her father is in heaven with all of the people he sent there.Moon leads his band of mutineers into the chamber and a sword fight ensues where Gilbert also falls into the pit of acid. Yellowbeard offers Dan the opportunity to fight Moon, but Triola intervenes and pushes the boatswain into the acid.Returning to the beach, Yellowbeard uses his sword to shave the top of Dan's head, revealing the map. When they unearth the treasure, Dan embraces his father, accidentally stabbing him with a dagger. Yellowbeard is proud of his son for adhering to the family tradition of patricide. Clement confiscates the treasure in the name of Queen Anne, prompting Triola to reject Dan and declare her love for the commander.Later, while Commander Clement considers keeping the treasure for himself, Dan and Yellowbeard burst into his cabin and take control of the ship. Triola has renewed affection for Dan, and Yellowbeard declares, ""There's pirating to be done."""

When Rusty James breaks the treaty in a fight with Biff Wilcox, and gets seriously hurt, his brother suddenly appears.

Accepting the challenge, Rusty James then talks with his friends: the wily Smokey, loyal B.J., and tall, nerdy Steve; who all have a different take on the forthcoming fight. Steve mentions that Rusty James' older brother, ""The Motorcycle Boy,"" would not be pleased with the fight as he had previously created a truce forbidding gang fights, or ""rumbles."" Rusty James dismisses him, saying that the Motorcycle Boy (whose real name is never revealed) has been gone for two months, leaving without explanation or promise of return.Rusty James visits his girlfriend, Patty, then meets his cadre and walks to the abandoned garage lot, where Biff and his buddies suddenly appear. The two battle, with the fight ending when Rusty James disarms Biff and beats him almost unconscious.

Incensed, the Motorcycle Boy sends his motorcycle flying into Biff. The Motorcycle Boy and Steve take Rusty James home (past Officer Patterson, a street cop who's long had it in for the Motorcycle Boy) and nurse him to health through the night. Steve and the injured Rusty James talk about how the Motorcycle Boy is 21 years old, colorblind, partially deaf, and noticeably aloof; the last trait causing many to believe he is insane.The Motorcycle Boy and Rusty James share the next evening with their alcoholic, welfare-dependent father, who says that the Motorcycle Boy takes after his mother whereas, it is implied, Rusty James takes after him. Things start to go wrong for Rusty James and he's eventually kicked out of school after his frequent fights.

Later, Steve and Rusty James wander drunkenly home, and are attacked by thugs, but both are saved by the Motorcycle Boy. As he nurses Rusty James again, the Motorcycle Boy tells him that the gang life and the rumbles he yearns for and idolizes are not what he believes them to be. Steve calls the Motorcycle Boy crazy, a claim which the Motorcycle Boy does not deny, further prompting Rusty James to believe his brother is insane, just like his runaway mother supposedly was.Rusty James meets up with the Motorcycle Boy the next day in a pet store, where the latter is strangely fascinated with the Siamese fighting fish, which he refers to as ""rumble fish."" Officer Patterson suspects they will try to rob the store. The brothers leave and meet their father, who explains to Rusty James that, contrary to popular belief, neither his mother nor brother are crazy, but rather they were both born with an acute perception. The brothers go for a motorcycle ride through the city and arrive at the Pet Store where the Motorcycle Boy breaks in and starts to set the animals loose. Rusty James makes a last-gasp effort to convince his brother to reunite with him, but the Motorcycle Boy refuses, explaining that the differences between them are too great for them to ever have the life Rusty James speaks of. The Motorcycle Boy takes the fish and rushes to free them in the river, but is fatally shot by Officer Patterson before he can. Rusty James, after hearing the gunshot, finishes his brother's last attempt while a large crowd of people converges on his body.Rusty James finally reaches the Pacific Ocean (something the Motorcycle Boy failed to do) and enjoys the shining sun and flocks of birds flying around the beach.

The liaison of the prisoners with Yonoi and Sergeant Gengo Hara, Colonel John Lawrence, has lived in Japan for many years and can understand both cultures and their leader is Captain Hicksley. When the rebel Jack leaves the infirmary, he challenges Yonoi, who is a man that follows the principles of honor and discipline. Yonoi believes that Jack is possessed by demons and their confrontation will lead the British to a tragic end.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Java, 1942. Focusing primarily on five players, the clashes between east and west and within the ranks on each side at a Japanese POW camp, where most of the prisoners are British, are presented. For the east, there is the camp commander, Captain Yonoi, a man in the traditional sense of a Japanese warrior, he who lives by those traditions. He believes that all British are liars. His guards, including Sergeant Gengo Hara, will often subvert his command in their own views of how to get the upper hand over their prisoners while satisfying their own needs, they may or may not be willing to accept the consequences if caught, those consequences again in the Japanese tradition. For the west, there is the ranking officer representing the prisoners, Group Captain Hicksley, an RAF pilot who is all bluster in sticking up for his men. Outwardly, it is Colonel John Lawrence who tries to bridge the gap between east and west, he who is fluent in Japanese and who truly tries to understand and thus react to the actions of their Japanese and Korean captors appropriately. However, recent arrival Major Jack Celliers, may be the one who truly has the most profound affect in bridging that gap especially as he is carrying some emotional baggage not associated with the war.—Huggo"
Videodrome,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086541/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A programmer at a TV station that specializes in adult entertainment searches for the producers of a dangerous and bizarre broadcast. Max Renn is the President of Channel 83 Civic-TV, a small television station on the UHF dial. He defends his programming of largely X-rated shows - which depict graphic sex and extreme violence - as a pure matter of economic survival as a small station. Behind closed doors in specific company, he would admit that he enjoys such programming, but as President will stay away from associated activities that may be dangerous for him in its purchase. His current girlfriend, radio personality Nicki Brand, who he met on a television talk show, is sexually aroused by light mutilation on her person, that despite or because her radio show is like an open air crisis hotline. On that same talk show, the other guest via video feed was Professor Brian O'Blivion - solely his stage name - who believes that television and video broadcasts will one day overtake the world as reality, which may make Max's programming in combination more dangerous. In Max's search for the next big thing in like programming already on Channel 83, Harlan, his pirater who scans satellite signals, illegally obtains a satellite feed of something called Videodrome, which depicts continual sexualized torture and murder with no storyline of which to speak. The background behind Videodrome is unknown, but believing it is that big thing for which he is looking, Max is determined to find the producers so that he can purchase it for his station. He is concerned for Nicki if she goes ahead against his warnings in wanting to appear on Videodrome, however it does not lessen his desire to purchase it. If Max in turn does not heed the warning of Masha, one of his long time show suppliers, based on what little she discovers about it, Max may discover that Videodrome is just the next but destructive step in O'Blivion's prognostication.—Huggo When Max Renn goes looking for edgy new shows for his sleazy cable TV station, he stumbles across the pirate broadcast of a hyper-violent torture show called Videodrome. As he struggles to unearth the origins of the program, he embarks on a hallucinatory journey into a shadow world of right-wing conspiracies, sadomasochistic sex games, and bodily transformation. Starring James Woods and Deborah Harry in one of her first film roles, Videodrome is one of writer/director David Cronenberg's most original and provocative works, fusing social commentary with shocking elements of sex and violence. With groundbreaking special effects makeup by Academy Award®-winner Rick Baker, Videodrome has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and mind-bending science fiction films of the 1980s. Max Renn runs a TV channel, and when looking for new material to show--he discovers ""Videodrome."" His girlfriend, Nicki Brand, goes to audition for the show, and Max gets drawn into the underlying plot that uses the show as its front for a global conspiracy.—Paul Reynolds <pauljr@innotts.co.uk> The president of Civic TV Channel 83, Max Renn, is always looking for new cheap and erotic movies for his station. When his employee, Harlan, decodes a pirate video broadcast showing torture, murder, and mutilation called ""Videodrome,"" Max becomes obsessed to get this series for his channel. He contacts his supplier, Masha, and asks her to find the party responsible for the transmission. A couple of days later, Masha tells that ""Videodrome"" is real snuff movies. Max's sado-masochistic girlfriend Nicki Brand decides to travel to Pittsburgh, where the show is based, to audition. Max investigates further, and through a video by the media prophet Brian O'Blivion, he learns that that TV screens are the retina of the mind's eye, being part of the brain, and ""Videodrome"" transmissions create a brain tumor in the viewer, changing the reality through video hallucination.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a sleazy Toronto UHF television station specializing in sensationalistic programming. Displeased with his station's current lineup (which mostly consists of softcore pornography), Renn is on a seemingly endless quest for something that isn't so ""soft"" and will ""break through"" to a new audience.One morning Renn is summoned to the clandestine office of Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), who operates CIVIC-TV's pirate satellite dish, a technologically advanced satellite run on an amalgamation of high-tech components that allows it to pirate broadcasts from as far away as Asia. Harlan shows Renn ""Videodrome,"" a plotless television show apparently being broadcast out of Malaysia, which depicts the brutal torture and eventual murder of anonymous victims in a bizarre, reddish-orange chamber. Believing this to be the future of television-- snuff TV-- Renn orders Harlan to begin pirating the show.Appearing on a Rena King's TV talk show, Renn defends his station's programming choices to Nikki Brand (Deborah Harry), a sadomasochistic psychiatrist, and Professor Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley), a pop-culture analyst and philosopher who will only appear on television if his image is broadcast into the studio, onto a television, from a remote location. O'Blivion hijacks the interview and delivers a speech prophesying a future in which television supplants real life.Renn dates Nikki, who is sexually aroused when Renn shows her an episode of Videodrome and coaxes him into having sex with her while they watch it. Renn goes once again to Harlan's office, where Harlan informs him that the signal delay which caused it to appear to be coming from Malaysia was a ploy by the broadcaster. In fact, Videodrome is being broadcast out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Renn tells Nikki of his discovery and she excitedly goes to Pittsburgh to try and audition for the show.When Nikki fails to return to Toronto, Renn contacts Masha Borowski (Lynne Gorman), a softcore feminist pornographer with long-standing ties to the porn community, and asks her to help him find out the truth about Videodrome. Through Masha, Renn learns that Videodrome is the public ""face"" of a political ideology movement with unspecified but apparently violent goals. Masha further informs Renn that Brian O'Blivion knows about Videodrome.Max Renn tracks down O'Blivion's office to The Cathode Ray Mission, a mission where homeless individuals are provided food, shelter, and clothing, and encouraged to engage in marathon sessions of television viewing. Renn discovers that the mission is run by O'Blivion's daughter, Bianca (Sonja Smits), with the goal of helping to bring about her father's vision of a world in which television replaces every aspect of everyday life.Later, Renn views a videotape in which O'Blivion informs him that ""the Videodrome"" is a socio-political battleground in which a war is being fought for control of the minds of the people of North America. Shortly thereafter, Renn begins experiencing disturbing hallucinations in which his torso transforms into a bloody, vaginal VCR. In one hallucination, Renn finds himself strapped to a chair while a hooded figure is strangling him. The hood comes off to reveal Nikki. Her lips fill the screen of a TV set where she says: ""Come to me."" Renn leans in close. Pulling and undulating, the screen envelopes his face.At the mission, Bianca tells Renn that these are side-effects from having viewed Videodrome, which is in fact the carrier of a malicious broadcast signal that causes the viewer to develop a malignant brain tumor. Brian O'Blivion helped to create it as part of his vision for the future, but when he found out that it was to be used for malicious purposes, he attempted to stop his partners; they used his own invention to kill him. In the year before his death, O'Blivion recorded tens of thousands of videos, which now form the basis of his television appearances. Bianca sends Renn away with an armful of videotapes to watch. As he watches one tape, holding a pistol, he scratches his stomach in which the vagina-like slit opens, into which his gun disappears. On the tape, O'Blivion says: ""There is nothing real outside our perception of reality, is there?""Renn is contacted by Videodrome's producer, the Spectacular Optical Corporation, an eyeglasses company that acts as a front for a NATO weapons manufacturer. The head of Spectacular Optical, Barry Convex, (Leslie Carlson) has been working with Harlan to get Renn to broadcast Videodrome as part of a crypto-government conspiracy to morally and ideologically ""purge"" North America, giving fatal brain tumors to ""lowlifes"" fixated on extreme sex and violence. Convex produces a high-tech helmet to record Renn's hallucinations, to find out why he seems to be functioning when none of the other ""test subjects"" has returned to ""normality."" Convex places the helmet on Renn's head and leaves the room.Renn hallucinates himself in Videodrome with Nicki. As he whips an organic TV set, Nicki's image transforms into Masha. Renn wakes up in his own bed with Masha dead at his side. Renn calls Harlan to come over with his camera, but when he arrives, he sees nothing in the bed to photograph. Totally wired, Renn says they must watch last nights Videodrome broadcast as he is in it. At the lab, Harlan reveals that there never was a broadcast, only pre-recorded tapes which he never watched. Just then Convex enters. He says that they chose Channel 83 for the first transmission of the Videodrome signal because of it's sleazy content and audience. ""Why would anybody watch a show like Videodrome?"" says Convex.Under Convex's influence he produces a pulsating VHS tape and Renn's stomach-slit opens to receive his program. Convex orders Renn to: ""kill your partners and give me Channel 83."" Renn pulls his gun back from the slit and black metal tendrils extend into his hand.Renn goes back to the CIVIC-TV station and shoots both Moses and Raphael in the Channel 83 boardroom, his gun/hand now a single organic fusion. His next program is to kill Bianca O'Blivion. He breaks into the Mission, but hesitates when Bianca plays him Nikki's death scene on Videodrome. She was killed on the show along with all those other people by Spectacular Optical Corporation. A flesh-gun emerges from the TV set and shoots him - a violent deprogramming. Bianca inserts her own tape into Renn's slit. With that she re-programs him to go after the ones responsible for creating Videodrome. She tells him he is: ""the video word made flesh. Death to Videodrome. Long live the new flesh.""Back at the Channel 83 studios, Harlan congratulates Renn on his good work, and changes his program. When Harlan withdraws his hand from Renn's slit to retrieve the videotape program, he is horrified to see his hand become a ticking bloody organic grenade. The explosion kills Harlan and blows a hole in the wall of the studio which Renn calmly steps out.At the Spectacular Optical trade show at the Toronto Convention Centre, Convex introduces the new spring collection, the Medici range. Renn approaches the stage and shoots Convex with his gun/hand, who falls dead and his entire body erupts in a gory and sickening mass of tumors as people scream and panic. Renn waves his hand/gun to the assembly declaring: ""Death to Videodrome! Long live the new flesh!""Afterwards, Renn takes refuge on a derelict boat in an abandoned harbor, where Nicki appears to him on another television that appears. As Renn sits on a filthy mattress, Nicki tells him he has weakened Videodrome, but that in order to completely defeat it, he has to ""leave the old flesh."" The television then shows an image of Renn shooting himself in the head with his gun/hand, which causes the TV set to explode, splattering the deck of the ship with bloody, human intestines and multicolored goo. Imitating what he has just seen on TV, Renn says his final words, ""Long live the New Flesh"", and then he pulls the trigger."

Savage Islands,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085994/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A swashbuckling adventure which takes place in the mid-1800's on the South Pacific islands where bloody raids and battles were once the rule of the day. It's the late nineteenth century in the South Pacific. Bully Hayes considers himself a pirate with morals and standards, and while he has never flown the skull and crossbones, he has dealt in illegal trade, albeit never having swindled or killed anyone who didn't deserve it. It is after one of those trading missions with a native tribe gone wrong that he is arrested ""by an old friend"" under Spanish law for attempting to sell arms to the enemy, a crime punishable by hanging. Awaiting his fate in a dank prison cell, he tells his lawyer how he came to this situation. What Bully specifically tells him is the last escapades aboard his former beloved ship, the Rona, the long voyage transporting New Englander Nathaniel Williamson and his British fiancée Sophie to their South Pacific mission where they were to be married before bringing the word of God to the natives. Earnest Nathaniel disliked him from the beginning due to the harmless or not so harmless flirtation between him and Sophie. Before Nathaniel and Sophie married, the mission was massacred, and by the time Nathaniel, one of the few survivors, regained consciousness, Sophie was gone, he believed at Bully's hands. Alone, Nathaniel, without the necessary survival skills, went looking for Bully and Sophie. Nathaniel, within an inch of his life, eventually found Bully - or in reality Bully found him, convincing him that it was probably his former business partner, the unscrupulous Ben Pease, who massacred the mission and kidnapped Sophie. So Bully and ""Nate"" joined forces to locate Ben and Sophie as Bully recognized his feelings for her and as Nate recognized her feelings for Bully. They discovered that Ben was working in cooperation with the Germans who were trying to set up a South Pacific outpost for global reach, and were probably going to use Sophie as a trading item to purchase an island from the natives who used maidens like Sophie as a sacrifice to their God. Nate and Bully and their crew had to save Sophie before she was used as a sacrifice, which meant needing to defeat Ben, the Germans and the natives of that island. The outcome of this tale will have an effect as Bully ultimately takes the walk to face the noose.—Huggo"

Wolfe's assistants Neil Allen and Willie Loman find romance while trying to save the drugs, violence, and rock and roll from Beverly's schemes.—<rth@ece.arizona.edu> It is December 31, 1982, and the Saturn Theater is preparing for its big New Years Eve concert. The show's midnight finale is having technical problems that narrowly avoid injuring owner and master showman Max Wolfe (Allen Garfield, credited as Allen Goorwitz), who has operated the Saturn since 1968. Fortunately stage manager Neil Allen (Daniel Stern) is on the job. Then former stage manager Willy Loman (Gail Edwards) shows up, and to Neil's chagrin Max refers to her as ""the best in the business.""Max Wolfe holds a 30-year lease to the theater, but his toadying nephew Sammy (Miles Chapin) has other ideas. Reptilian concert promoter Colin Beverly (Ed Begley, Jr., wearing a white polyester jumpsuit) arrives with his henchmen Mark and Marv (former teen heartthrobsBobby ShermanandFabian), who parrot their boss's every assertion with a slight paraphrase. Beverly offers to buy Max out of his lease with what seems to be a sweetheart deal at Beverly's concert auditorium and stadium, but Max refuses. Colin Beverly, cementing his role as the evil villain, replies, ""This building is coming down and eighty-eight stories are going up. So f--k you and f--k rock and roll."" Max, incensed, lunges at Beverly, only to collapse of an apparent heart attack. Outside, Sammy informs Beverly that he stands to inherit the theater from his uncle, and Beverly embraces Sammy as a new ally.

Meanwhile, one of the stagehands is stealing drugs from the doctor's bag. Coming up with only aspirin, cortizone, and suppositories, he laments that they have ""too much work and not much time... what we need is something that's going to blast us into the fast lane."" With a flash of light, a cloud of smoke, and the strains of Adrian Belew's ""Big Electric Cat"", Electric Larry suddenly appears -- a seven-foot-tall man with no face and glowing red eyes, wearing a flat-brimmed pimp's hat with mirrored band and a silver trench coat, and carrying a chrome attaché case. He waves a gloved hand over the case and it magically opens to reveal a stash of pills of every conceivable shape and color, and suddenly the stage is alive with artificially sped-up activity.The various performers for the show are introduced:* Captain Cloud and the Rainbow Telegraph, Max Wolfe's favorite band, arrive in an aging bus that is painted à la the Merry Pranksters' Furthur. The Captain (the Turtles'Howard Kaylan) is carrying a backstage pass for New Years 1969, not 1983, but no matter -- Max gives him the finale for old times' sake. Captain Cloud replies blissfully with one of his many tripped-out-guru epigrams: ""The end is always a new beginning.""* Nada arrives in a battered 1957 Chevy Belair, and her entire 15-member band piles out of the back seat in a ""clown car"" gag. The band is an amalgam of many disparate styles of music that appeared on MTV in the early 1980s -- part bubble-gum pop, part New Wave, part garage rock. Locked in the trunk is ""Special Guest Star"" Piggy (Lee Vingof the L.A. punk band Fear), a self-destructive, anarchistic punk -- with an articulate knowledge of music business contract terminology.* King Blues, the King of the Blues (Bill Henderson), a spoof of Muddy Waters. Although he is a kindly man, King Blues' opinion of himself is so great that a eulogy for a fellow bluesman ends with the King threatening God ""you better take care of him, or I'm going to wax your ass.""* Auden (Lou Reed), ""metaphysical folk singer, event of the '70s, [and] antisocial recluse,"" hasn't been heard from in six years -- but Max is certain he can convince him to play the Saturn, since he's ""calling from his deathbed."" Auden answers the phone in a shot that mimics perfectly the cover of Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home, except that everything, including the woman lounging on the couch, is covered in cobwebs. Hearing that Max is making ""a deathbed request,"" Auden bursts into song (using that phrase as a lyric) and decides ""there's a concept album in this, I'll be right over."" He hops into a cab and tells the driver to ""take the scenic route, I got some things to work out.""* Reggie Wanker (Malcolm McDowell), ""20 years of rock and roll and still on top"", is a Mick Jagger spoof with his own private jet and a countess for a girlfriend. Years of fan adoration (and drug use) have left Reggie jaded, bored, and uninspired with his life as the ultimate rock star.The new by-the-book fire inspector, Connell O'Connell (Robert Picardo), arrives and informs Neil that no fireworks and no open flames will be permitted in the theater.Max and Neil give a brief pep talk to the Saturn staff, then the doors are opened and the audience streams in. While the ushers (includingClint Howard) take pains to search everyone and begin to accumulate a massive stockpile of confiscated contraband -- including kegs, firearms, and a 500-pound bomb -- they seem oblivious to the seven-foot tall walking marijuana joint that enters excitedly, accompanied by two Rastafarians.King Blues opens the show, performing two of his ""own"" hit songs, ""The Blues Had A Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll"" (by Muddy Waters) and ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" (by Willie Dixon). Next the Nada Band take the stage and perform ""I'm Not Going to Take It No More."" Piggy leads the band in a viciously punk-rock version of ""Hoochie Coochie Man,"" complete with stage dives and slam dancing, and King Blues recognizes it from its opening notes. He appraises Piggy's rendition warmly, saying, ""Who said a white boy can't sing the blues?""After their set, Nada, Piggy and the band return triumphantly to their dressing room, only to be disappointed by the poor selection of refreshments. Nada says, ""champagne again?"" which cues Electric Larry to reappear; this time his attaché case contains a large rock of cocaine, which grinds itself into powder and distributes into neat lines with a wave of Larry's hand. Piggy, inexplicably, panics at the sight of Larry and flees the room.Reggie Wanker heads for the stage, while fires of appreciation (many of them much bigger than the concert-cliché upraised lighter) burn throughout the audience. At the same time, the fire inspector is chasing the giant joint, now partially burned down, through the mezzanine with a fire extinguisher.As the show proceeds, Sammy tries to find ways to sabotage the theater, including fueling a fire in the basement and cutting the fire hose. Neil and Willy manage to put the fire out by connecting their hose to a water pipe in the dreaded mens' room. Mark and Marv give Sammy a bomb, which he plants in the rocket ship that Max will ride during the final countdown to midnight.Reggie sings a celebration of egotism, ""Hot Shot,"" then moves on to a version of ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" (leading King Blues to ""bask in my own genius."") During his set Reggie sets off fireworks, and the fire inspector (now in the audience) rushes the stage. The bass player hits the inspector with his guitar and kicks him off the stage, a reference to Pete Townshend's treatment of Abbie Hoffman at Woodstock. The inspector runs backstage, where he collides with Sammy (who is fleeing the impending bomb). Both are knocked unconscious and fall to the ground. Electric Larry, unbidden, shows up for the third and final time to squirt an eyedropper of clear liquid (presumably LSD) into the tank of the water cooler. He delivers his only line -- ""Happy new year"" -- and vanishes. Moments later the inspector and Sammy are revived and drink water from the cooler, which almost immediately gives them animated rainbow visions. The inspector is last seen spraying his fire extinguisher at random, seeing fires everywhere, while Sammy abandons his greedy persona and starts giving away his material possessions.Willy overhears Mark and Marv talking about the bomb, and is captured by them and Colin Beverly. They lock her in the trunk of Beverly's limo and drive off. Auden, still riding in the taxi cab, realizes that day has turned to night and orders the driver to ""step on it."" The cab soon collides with Beverly's limo, which releases Willy, who escapes and runs back toward the theater.During a ridiculously extended drum solo, Reggie has returned to his dressing room for an interlude with about a dozen half-naked groupies. His girlfriend, Countess Chantamina (Anna Bjorn), discovers his infidelity and invites the nerdy, virginal stage hand Joey (Dan Frischman) into another dressing room as an act of retribution. Reggie finds them and, feeling betrayed, returns to the stage to deliver a heartfelt ballad reprise of ""Hot Shot."" As the song ends, Reggie walks backstage, where he asks Neil for a glass of water -- which comes from the now-magical water cooler.Left wanting an encore from Reggie, the audience begins to get unruly, so Neil puts on a cartoon -- a black-and-white print of the 1935 Technicolor shortThe Sunshine Makers. Meanwhile, Reggie heads to the bathroom, where his penis initiates a conversation with him, explaining that tonight's performance was Reggie's greatest because it had emotion. Reggie decides to name his penis as his band's new manager, telling his bandmate Toad (the Doors'John Densmore), ""Rock and roll is going to be fun again.""Only a few minutes before midnight, Willy reaches the theater and tells Neil about the bomb. With the help of Captain Cloud, Neil learns from Sammy where the bomb is hidden, and he radios up to Max, who is already riding the booby-trapped rocket ship down a wire from the upper reaches of the theater. Max finds the bomb and tries to throw it to Neil, but instead it lands in the crowd, which tosses it playfully, as if it is yet another concert beach ball -- overhead from person to person. As the crowd counts down the final ten seconds, the bomb makes its way out of the main hall, through the lobby, and out the front door. Just as Colin Beverly's limo pulls up to the curb, the bomb is tossed into it -- and the last second ticks away. There is a big explosion, everyone shouts ""happy new year,"" and Captain Cloud leads them all in ""Auld Lang Syne"". Beverly, Mark and Marv crash through a skylight, relatively unharmed, and the celebration ends happily.As the last of the audience leaves, Auden finally arrives, having paid a cab fare of $11,864.90 with the cash in his pocket. Neil introduces Auden to his younger sister, Susie (Stacey Nelkin), who is a big fan. Max gives Neil the lease to the theater, saying he intends to retire. Neil offers partnership to Willy.The end credits roll, while Auden sings Reed's ""Little Sister"" to an audience of three: Susie... and in the balcony, the giant joint and a lonely German Shepherd guide dog. The final caption reads, ""Thanks for the memories to the entire staff of the Fillmore East 1968-71."""
Lianna,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085838/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A happily married woman comes to realize herself of being a repressed lesbian after she has an affair with a female college professor, and then tries to come to terms with her newfound lifestyle. Lianna and her husband Dick have been married for a few years but the marriage isn't a happy one, since Dick treats her with arrogance. One day Lianna falls in love - with Ruth, a teacher. The people who know them act different: her husband with feelings of sexual betrayal, her children with curiosity and Lianna's friends with ambivalence.—Mattias Thuresson In a northern New Jersey college town, Lianna (Linda Griffiths), the wife of English teacher Dick Massey (Jon DeVries), visits her husband's classroom as he gives special attention to his attractive female students. While Dick worries about his prospects for becoming a tenured professor, Lianna and her friend, Sandy (Jo Henderson), attend a child psychology class conducted by visiting professor Ruth Brennan (Jane Hallaren), for whom Lianna develops an attraction.Dick resents the two nights per week Lianna spends in class, believing she should be attending to their two children, 10-year-old Theda (Jessica Wight MacDonald) and 13-year-old Spencer (Jesse Solomon), or assisting him with his research. Lianna argues that she finds the class exhilarating and refuses to quit. She further exacerbates the situation by informing Dick the following Friday that she is attending class that night, rather than joining him at a faculty party.After class, Ruth accepts Lianna's offer to assist with her latest research project, and makes a dinner date with her. Hoping to appease Dick, Lianna attends the party, and finds her husband in the host's back yard with a topless female student. A heated argument ensues when they return home.Lianna has a chance encounter with Ruth the following afternoon, and they discuss their personal lives. That evening, Dick announces his departure for a film festival in Toronto, Canada, and suggests that the brief hiatus might allow the couple time to assess their marriage. Later, Lianna dresses for her dinner with Ruth, while Theda spends the night with Sandy's daughter, Ellie, and Spencer occupies himself with pornographic magazines.During dinner, Lianna talks openly about her attraction to women, and Ruth seduces her. After their lovemaking, Lianna returns home in the early morning hours, feeling self-conscious about her lesbian affair, and guilty about leaving her son alone.

Upon Dick's return from Toronto, Lianna informs him of her affair. When she voices her desire for a legal separation, Dick orders her out of the house, and threatens her parental rights. The following day, Lianna troubles really begin when she is disappointed when Ruth denies her request that they live together, explaining that it could result in a scandal and the loss of her job.After informing her children of the separation, Lianna rents a small apartment and finds employment in a supermarket as a cashier. Meanwhile, Dick explains the reason for the separation to the children, and although Spencer accepts his mother's new life, Theda is disillusioned.One night, after making love to Lianna, Ruth reveals that she is in a committed relationship with a woman at her home university, but is unsure whether she wants it to continue. Later, they go dancing at a lesbian bar, where Lianna sees a neighbor among the patrons, and after they overcome their mutual embarrassment, the two women dance together.As Lianna becomes more comfortable with her sexuality, Ruth must remind her to be more discreet with her public displays of affection, or jeopardize both their reputations and lives. When Ruth announces she is making a brief trip to her university to determine the future of her relationship, Lianna feels rejected and becomes depressed.The next day at Lianna's apartment, she is unsuccessfully propositioned by Jerry Carlson (John Sayles), one of Dick's colleagues who makes a quick visit. But Lianna has better luck when she is befriended by her upstairs neighbors Sheila (Maggie Renzi) and Liz (Nancy Elizabeth Kammer), a pair of students who are accepting of Lianna's sexuality. Later, Dick allows Lianna custody of the children two days per week, and threatens to expose her affair with Ruth if she does not accept his terms.Ruth returns to New Jersey, and while she is free of her commitment, she also rejects Lianna, explaining that she is not ready to start another relationship. When Lianna next encounters Jerry, he apologizes for propositioning her and endorses her romance with Ruth. Dick continues to resent Lianna, but promises he will not come between her and the children, although she believes he simply wants more free time for his sexual liaisons. Lianna overcomes Theda's disapproval by brushing the child's hair, as she did every night before the separation, proving that she is still the same person she always was.With her work complete, Ruth decides to leave town to return to California and invites Lianna to spend one final night with her. Afterward, Lianna is despondent, but she finds comfort in a chance meeting with Sally as they rekindle their friendship."

Angel has regained her consciousness, and then attempts to 'sing the creature back.' Singing a song titled 'Send Love Through,' Omar joins her in a duet, fulfilling the conditions of ""one heart, one voice, one song"" to banish the demon, causing the creature to shrink back into the hole from whence it came.Moke desperately tries to stop them, but is thrown into the hole by another of the Schlepper Brothers, upset by the death of Zip. Mok attempts to climb out of the pit, but ends up falling into the abyss as the pit disappears, and the sun rises on a new day outside of the Power Plant."

In addition, the chief brewer is also a doctor at the local insane asylum and is testing the beer on the patients.—grantss Based on Shakespeare's _Hamlet_. Bob and Doug Mackenzie play the roles Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. A hilarious (and accurate) representation.—Steve Tetreault <veilance@eden.rutgers.edu> Bob and Doug McKenzie (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) are two dim-witted and unemployed ""hosers"" living in Toronto, Ontario who find themselves in a bind when they squander their father's beer money and then run out of beer. The brothers place a live mouse in a beer bottle in an attempt to blackmail the local beer store into giving them free Elsinore beer, but are told to take up the matter at the Elsinore brewery instead. After presenting the mouse to management at the brewery, the brothers are given jobs on the bottling line inspecting the bottles for mice. They take this opportunity to drink lots of free beer off the line; later, they present their parents with a van full of free Elsinore beer products as part of their payment with their new jobs.Meanwhile, the evil owner of the brewery, Brewmeister ""B.M."" Smith (Max von Sydow), is perfecting a secret plan to take over the world by placing a mind-control drug in Elsinore beer which, while rendering the consumer docile, also makes him or her attack others when stimulated by certain musical tones. Smith tests this adulterated beer on patients of the conveniently located Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane, which is connected by underground tunnels to the brewery. The effects of the tainted beer are demonstrated in an extended sequence during which the mental patients don armored Star Wars-style hockey garb and, after consuming the beer, respond to synthesizer music by variously playing hockey, skating together in sync, and brawling on the ice.It seems the former brewery owner John Elsinore has recently died under mysterious circumstances and his daughter, Pam (Lynne Griffin), having recently turned 21, has been given full control of the Elsinore brewery. Pam's incompetent uncle Claude (Paul Dooley), in the interim, had married her widowed mother and is reluctant to give up his recently-gained control of the brewery. The reason for this is further revealed to be that the bumbling Claude is collaborating with Brewmeister Smith, for whom he is a buffoonish toady, providing a cover for the Brewmeister's nefarious plans. Bob and Doug blunder into the midst of these plans when they rescue Pam from a malfunctioning security gate and both become fast friends with her.While exploring the massive brewery, Bob and Doug find a shuttered cafeteria containing an old Galactic Border Patrol video game that supernaturally reveals that Brewmeister Smith murdered John Elsinore and that Uncle Claude was deeply involved. Additionally, while poking around the brewery, Bob and Doug meet a one time hockey great, Jean ""Rosie"" LeRose (Angus MacInnes), whom Bob recognizes from the hockey card he has back home at his parents' house. Having suffered a career-ending nervous breakdown and fallen under Smith's control, Rosie gets locked up at the insane asylum but is determined to fight against the Brewmeister's plot for world domination.Eventually, Bob and Doug wander into Brewmeister's operations room while he is away, and Doug takes a record disk of John Elsinore's murder, believing that it is a New Wave bootleg record. Immediately afterward, Brewmeister and Claude shoot the brothers with tranquilizers. They then dress up in the brothers clothes where they are shown on security camera shooting tranquilizer darts at Pam and a friendly associate, named Henry Green, and put their unconcious bodies in kegs.When Bob and Doug wake up, they are back in their van, convinced that their suspicious discoveries were all just dreams, and they are instructed by Claude to deliver two kegs of beer (actually containing an unconscious Pam and her father's friend, Henry Green) to a party at the bottom of a big hill. However, the brakes have been modified to only allow two stops before giving out altogether.Nevertheless, as Bob and Doug drive, they soon get distracted and decide to stop off at their house to feed their dog. They also leave behind the incriminating record disk of Brewmeister and Claude's actions at their house. Having wasted one stop prior, they find themselves unable to stop the now-speeding vehicle and eventually wind up jumping off of the Toronto pier into Lake Ontario. Rosie arrives and tries to rescue Pam who cannot swim, but after saving her, he passes out and sinks to the bottom of the lake.The police rescue Pam and the badly injured Henry, and assume that the Mackenzie brothers are dead, seeing as they have not surfaced the water for 10 minutes. When they send down a pair of scuba divers to inspect the van, however, they find that Bob and Doug never left their seats. They survived by inhaling air which was trapped in the many empty bottles rolling about in the van. With them is also Rosie, who had provided his last breath to Pam for her survival, and would have died if the brothers had not saved him as well. Unfortunately the accident causes memory loss for Pam who becomes near catatonic, and the brothers are therefore framed for the attempted murder of Pam Elsinore and Henry Green.When put on trial, Bob and Doug's crazy antics cause the judge to declare them insane, and he puts them under Brewmeister Smith's care at the Royal Canadian Institute for the Mentally Insane. Brewmeister assigns Ted, one of his cohorts, to find out everything that the brothers know about what they saw at the brewery and if they have the missing record disk, but they just end up frustrating Ted with their childish and comical behavior.Meanwhile, Claude goes to the hospital where the injured Rosie is being treated and, while impersonating a doctor, attempts to kill him in his hospital bed with a syringe filled with poison. But his plan fails when Claude is mistaken for a doctor and he is forced to inject his syringe into an epiletic patient and is forced to flee from the hospital. Claude drives out of the parking lot without paying his ticket, and Rosie chases after him by stealing a car and beating up the parking lot attendant. The injured Henry Green, hearing about the attempt on Rosie's life, also escapes from the hospital in a stolen police car after the parking lot attendant calls the police to report the incident.Also a police inspector begins looking up various leads after visiting Claude earlier and catching something about his odd behavior. The Inspector pays a visit to the McKenzie brothers house to talk to their parents, but Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie are not home. However, the family dog drops off the incriminating record disk to the Inspector before supernaturally fleeing.Rosie goes to the institute and soon finds Bob and Doug in an electroshock treatment room where they are playfully zaping each other with high voltage electric shocks, and helps them escape. They also find Pam at the institute and rescue her as well. Rosie, having figured out Brewmeister's plan, foments an uprising among the brainwashed test subjects. Doug leads half of the hockey players to the shipping dock, where they shove Claude into the labeling machine until he can be arrested by the Inspector and the police. Rosie leads the other half to Brewmeister's control room, where Brewmeister Smith manages to kill all of them in a brief hand-to-hand combat except for Rosie, who shoves him into a light board with a hockey stick where John Elsinore's ghost (who had been haunting all of the electrical devices at the brewery, including the arcade game) effectively zaps him to death.Beforehand, Brewmeister Smith had captured Pam and Bob, and locks them in a huge brewery tank that he began slowly filling with beer in an attempt to drown them. Doug, Rosie, and the police eventually track them down and open the hatch. To their surprise, not a drop of liquid flows out. Pam climbs out and explains that Bob drank all the beer! (Bob has now cartoonishly grown to an obese figure standing over two stories tall.) She runs to the cafeteria where she finds Henry Green there and they both see her father's ghost, who tells her of how Brewmeister has already shipped out his free tainted beer to the local Oktoberfest and tells her to stop them.Meanwhile, Doug tries his best to figure out where to take Bob out of the tank to so he can take ""an enormous leak"". Bob warns Doug and Rosie to move away, and emits a powerful belch which blows off the end of the tank. When they hear that a wing of the brewery is on fire, Doug recruits Bob to extinguish it by urinating on it, returning him to normal size.After they put the fire out, the police ask for their help in stopping the Oktoberfest fiasco. They all go back to the boys' home and find their beer-drinking dog, Hosehead, a black dog who resembles a large skunk, to invade the party. Enticed by free beer and sausages, Hosehead runs down the street and begins to fly like Superman's dog Krypto (briefly wearing a cape that he loses to the wind) over the city, until he crashes down through the tent of the celebration and effectively scares everyone outside.In the end, the McKenzie Brothers save the day and Pam and Rosie find true love. As for the contaminated beer, Bob and Doug are allowed to haul away the lot... to apparently try to drink it all.(A loose framing story style is employed in the movie; the opening shows the McKenzies giving their discussion antics as the opening act for their segment show 'Great White North' (from the SCTV series) at a movie premiere for 'Mutants of 2051 A.D.', which they return to at the close of the movie during the closing credits for another discussion of the movie that the viewers just watched with them as the stars.)"

As Amanda gets up out of bed to look at her sleeping boyfriend, a person wearing a eerie and ugly mask grabs her by the hair and stabs her to death with a chef's knife, and then takes her doll sitting by the bed.The next day, a group of very different actresses hoping to play the part of Audra arrive at Stryker's snow-covered dwelling. They are Patti (Lynne Griffin), a comedienne-aspiring actress always telling jokes and who moonlights at a local comedy clubs telling stand-up jokes. Brooke (Linda Thorson) is a veteran actress hoping the role will make her sagging stage and film career. Tara (Sandra Warren) is a tall, attractive actress hoping to make it big. Lauraine (Anne Ditchburn) is a timid and hesitant dancer with a skill in ballet. Christie (Lesleh Donaldson) is an ice-staking figure queen hoping the roll will start her acting career. Stryker arrives with the actresses sitting around the table until he notices that one of them is missing. The odd workman, Matthew (Michael Wincott), sits down with the women, in which Stryker mentions that Amanda is the actress whom is missing. Suddenly, Samantha arrives and sits at the table with the five other actresses which makes Stryker look very uncomfortable.Later that evening, Tara is out in the so-called ""casting Jacuzzi"" with Matthew making the moves onto him. In the house, Stryker and Samantha are arguing about Stryker's decision to have someone else play Audra. Christie walks by, listens by the door and walks in where Stryker tells her that he and Samantha were rehearing a play that he wrote. He leads Christie out and to her room where he tries to make the moves onto her. Outside the house, someone picks up a sickle just as Stryker leaves Christie alone in her bed to weep over being forced upon.The next morning, Christie goes out to the nearby frozen lake to skate. The music from her boom box suddenly stops. Christie skates over to the boom box and she finds the freaky doll buried under the snow. The masked killer is there on the ice and skates towards Christie with the sickle in hand. The killer swings and Christie is hit in her shoulder, but the skater fights back and knocks the killer down to the ice with the doll. Christie runs into the woods, but when she stops to rest beside a tree, the killer grabs her from behind and kills her.Later that morning, Stryker is in a room with Patti, Tara, Lauriane, and Brooke when Samantha arrives saying that she wants to act and not be left out. Stryker has her sit in front of the others and he puts the same killer's mask onto her. He tells Samantha to seduce him without using words. ""Make me love you"", Stryker tells Samantha, who does not do anything. Stryker pulls off the mask and points to a mirror and tells Samantha that her face is a mask too.Afterwards, Stryker talks to Patti who tells him a couple of jokes. He tells her that he does not think a casting session is necessary for her. Patti yells at him, claiming that she is as good as the other actresses. Stryker almost smiles and says that he is ""enjoying a little bit of Audra"".Matthew is seen riding away on a snowmobile cart towards the woods to look for Christie. The unseen killer follows him.Later that evening, Stryker asks Samantha where the hag mask is, to which Samantha does not know. Brooke, reading the script in her room, hears a noise and goes into the bathroom, where she discovers Christie's severed head in the toilet. She runs into a room where Stryker is working with Tara and Laurian. The director follows Brooke back to her room, but the severed head is gone. He calms Brooke down and the two of them kiss.Meanwhile, Lauraine is practicing her ballet dancing in a studio room when the killer walks in...A little later that night, Samantha sees Stryker in bed with a sleeping Brooke by his side. When Styker and Brooke are talking about Brooke being cast in the role of Audra, someone walks into the room and fires a gun at them in which both of them fly out the window. Hearing the gunshots, Tara walks outside where she sees the dead bodies of Stryker and Brooke and screams. She runs around the house looking for the others. She finds Laurian's dead body in her room, but she does not notice a dead Matthew floating in the Jacuzzi outside having been stabbed. Tara encounters the masked killer and is chased around the house. The chase leads to the props warehouse next to the house where Tara looks for a place to hide. Tara eventually bests the masked killer twice; first by luring the killer to stab at her coat enabling her to counter-attack, and then beats the killer with a wooden club, but each time the killer gets back up and resumes the pursuit. After hiding in an air vent, Tara crawls out when she thinks the killer has walked out of the room. But she makes a noise in which the killer runs back in and kills her by slashing her to death with the sickle.A little later, Samantha walks into the kitchen where Patti is opening up a bottle of champagne. Samantha tells her about the institution and how Stryker committed and abandoned her so he can look for younger talent for the role of Audra which includes Patti and the younger actresses. Samantha tells Patti that she just killed Stryker for his betrayal as well as Brooke who happened to be there as his latest female conquest. Patti tells Samantha that she is celebrating that she will get the role, but becomes a little hurt and upset over the news of Samantha killing Stryker. Samantha tells Patti to forget about the role and just to back to where she came from and assures Patti that she will not harm her or any of her friends. Suddenly, Patti smirks at Samantha and says: ""there's only me left"". Patti tells Samantha that SHE killed all the other actresses to prevent them from claiming the role that she was meant to get. Patti grabs a butcher knife off the kitchen counter and stabs Samantha who screams.The final shot shows Patti now doing her comedy bit in the same insane asylum where Samantha was committed before a group of residents most of whom are not paying attention to the deranged actress whom is apparently still pleased that she is still working in the entertainment business as the character of Audra."
American Taboo,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083547/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Unstable thirty-something introvert, who works as a photographer's assistant, becomes obsessed with his underage female neighbor, who, to his horror, reciprocates his feelings due to possible Electra complex. Paul, a shy photographer of 30 years, avoids relationships in favor of the safety landscape photography. He is drawn into intimacy by a teenage youth who moves in next door and insinuates herself into his life.—<ttchinen@ucdavis.edu> Somewhat controversial psychological drama about Paul, a somewhat unstable introverted loner in his early thirties, who works as a photographer's assistant and prefers solitude over prolonged human contact. However, he does love both his job and his hobby - visiting an abandoned fort on the beach nearby and photographing the haunting scenery there. When his boss, an expert in erotic photography, leaves for a day, his attractive swinging wife arrives at the studio and tries to seduce Paul, but he quickly rejects her. His attitude changes, however, when he notices his next door neighbor, a high school student named Lisa Welch, in a convenience store with her mother. He becomes somewhat obsessed with the girl and even spies on her naked one night. Surprisingly, she eventually approaches him and they begin to hang out together on her insistence, which results in her attempt to seduce him. This backfires, but he does open up to her and she shows unusual maturity, dominance and understanding for him. Since she still wants them to be together, Paul must decide whether to embrace this forbidden twisted love they share or fight his feelings, especially since there's a remote possibility that Lisa is in fact his long lost daughter given for adoption at birth. Paul Wunderlich is a somewhat unstable 31-year-old loner, who works as a photographer's assistant and enjoys his solitude. However, although introverted and shy by nature, he is still able to carry a conversation, if need be, and loves his job despite having to work with people. He also has a hobby - visiting an abandoned fort on the nearby beach (the city he lives in seems to be Seattle) and looking for haunting places to photograph there. His boss is an expert in erotic photography and the two have a good working relationship, but Paul is none the less trying to sell his house in order to raise enough money and possibly start his own business. One day at the studio, the boss' attractive wife revels to Paul that they have an open marriage and tries to seduce him, but he quickly rejects her, not wanting any possible complications. His attitude change however, when he sees his next door neighbor, a high school student called Lisa Welch, in a convenience store with her mother, while shopping there one day. He becomes somewhat obsessed with the girl, following her home afterwards and even spying on her in the evening while throwing out the trash. In an attempt to stop himself from thinking about her, he visits a strip club, but only ends up drunk. On his way home that evening, Paul notices Lisa in her window undressing and touching herself. This stuns him for a moment, but when he hears the sound of a police car, he runs back home and vomits. A few days later, Lisa rings his doorbell and tries to sell him some cookies for school's charity event. Not having enough change, he lets her into the house to wait until he gets his wallet. Inside, she notices that he has a photo of her, which inexplicably not only does not make her freak out but she even proceeds to discuss it with him in a friendly way. After her visit, Paul's female real estate agent arrives with news of an offer for the house, but Paul rejects it claiming it's less than what he asked for as he needs more money for his business plan to become feasible. The next day, Lisa skips school but pretends she didn't and asks Paul to take her there in his car. During the ride, however, she convinces him to take her to the beach instead. Lisa also asks Paul to comment on her mother's short skirt she's wearing for a school project, which makes Paul immediately show both interest and great discomfort. They also discuss his age for the first time. At the beach, he gives her a sweater to wear and she pretends to be the figurehead of a wrecked old sailing ship there. Paul also takes her to his favorite place, the fort. She gets him to open up to her there. Among other things he explains his interest in photography to her. Eventually, she invites him to her room, while her mother is out, to show him her photo album and the pictures of her younger self. She then gets him to talk about his first crush and tries to seduce him with her story. This almost works, so she kisses him and he finally gives in. Their first night together, however, does not go well at all, as he becomes impatient and rough with her, and, consumed with desire, ejaculates prematurely, which leaves her in tears. Realizing what he did, he becomes angry at himself but, surprisingly, she once again shows great maturity and understanding for him, and still wants them to be together. Paul tries avoiding her after that, but she keeps coming back to his house trying to visit him. One night, after getting scared by a pushy prostitute, Paul finally decides to let Lisa in and opens up to her once again, telling her about his long lost daughter given for adoption at birth, after he, at 17, made a 15-year-old pregnant, and abortions were still illegal back then. Lisa, whose father is never seen nor mentioned in the movie, begins crying after hearing this but avoids commenting on it any further, which confuses Paul. The implication here is either that she could actually be the very daughter Paul lost or that her father left her in a similar way, which gave her a form of Electra complex. Either way, this issue is not addressed further in the film. In the morning, Paul looks through the window and notices it rained. He then sees a small and somewhat symbolic hole in the US flag he keeps attached to his door and intensely recalls through intercut flashbacks his passionate second time with Lisa the night before, which angers him again. However, after recalling his climax in the flashback, Paul smiles and returns back to bed, where Lisa is sleeping in the nude and apparently also happy. The ending implies that he chose to stay with her despite everything but it is very much open for interpretation."

The Deadly Spawn,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087998/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Alien creatures invade a small town and four teenagers, along with a young boy, attempt to escape from them. Two campers in the New Jersey woods have their outdoor fun interrupted by the arrival of a meteorite crashing nearby. They go to investigate the crater, but are suddenly attacked and devoured by alien parasites who have hitched a ride to Earth. After finishing off the campers, the hungry space monsters head for a nearby town, where they make their domain in the basement of an old house soon begin polishing off one hapless inhabitant after another. Four young teenagers, plus one pre-teen boy, try to find a way to stop the angry space monsters before they reproduce and literally eat humanity.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> Two campers are nearby when a meteor falls to Earth and lands in the woods near their campsite. When they go to investigate, they are attacked and eaten by a bizarre lifeform that emerges from the crashed rock, mostly unseen but apparently consisting of multiple heads with hundreds of teeth.Nearby the crash site is a large house located on a rural plot of land. The house is the home of Sam (James L. Brewster) and Barb (Elissa Neil), and their two school-age children, high school age Pete (Tom DeFranco) and his younger brother Charles (Charles George Hildebrandt). Visiting are Aunt Millie (Ethel Michelson) and Uncle Herb (John Schmerling).Sam and Barb rise before anybody else is awake; they have an unspecified trip planned, which Barb hopes can be put off because of the incessant rainstorm. Sam insists, and he goes downstairs to check the basement for flooding. A flapping basement window suggests that the creature from the meteor has taken refuge in the cellar, and sure enough, when Sam goes into the basement, he is eaten by the bizarre monstrosity. Barb suffers the same fate when she goes down to see what happened to Sam; the creature corners her and viciously bites off her face.Aunt Millie is awakened by screaming, but she attributes it to the horror movie that Charles is watching on TV in his room. Charles is obsessed with magic, monsters, and scaring people. When Aunt Millie returns to call Charles to breakfast, he surprises her by wearing a scary mask and costume and setting off flash powder when she opens the door. Pete disapproves of Charles' hobby, being more interested in schoolwork and science. Pete fancies himself a scientist, and he sets up a study date with three classmates, Ellen (Jean Tafler), Frankie (Richard Lee Porter), and Kathy (Karen Tighe).Aunt Millie has plans to have lunch with her mother, Bunny (Judith Mayes), who is planning an extravagant vegetarian lunch for a small group of friends. Uncle Herb, who is a psychologist, and also preparing for a conference, is interested in talking with Charles about his interest in the macabre, and Pete suggests that Herb has been asked by their parents to analyze his brother. Herb asks Charles how real the monsters are to him, and if he ever thinks he'll see one in real life. Charles seems to be well grounded, however, understanding that monsters are not real.Uncle Herb falls asleep in the living room, and Aunt Millie heads over to her mother's house to help set up the luncheon. An electrician arrives to investigate a problem with the circuit breaker box in the basement of the house, and Charles sees an opportunity to scare somebody. Slipping on his mask, he creeps down into the basement, which is flooded with several inches of water. But he discovers something strange; the basement is swarming with small tadpole-like creatures, the size of small fish. Charles follows them silently until he finds the electrician's body in a corner, with hundreds of the smaller creatures feasting on it. The creatures are all of varying sizes, from the small fish-sized tadpoles, to arm-sized worms, and there is a huge one, presumably the original, that has developed three different heads. The smaller ones seem to be spawn given off by the adult monster, each with the potential to grow into a full sized threat. The creatures have no eyes, and Charles discovers they are sensitive to sound in which their open mouths, filled with hundreds of sharp teeth, seem to be their receiver of sounds since they apparently do not have ears either. The large three-headed creature almost eats him when he snaps his fingers, and he is only able to distract it by tossing his flashlight into a far corner and allowing it to go after the noise. Adding to the horror, he sees Barb's disembodied head lying on the cement floor, partially consumed by spawn, and realizes that the creatures have killed his parents. Charles stands motionless against a basement wall, unable to move in fear of being discovered by the alien creatures.Meanwhile, Ellen and Frankie arrive for the study session in a flurry of excitement; they have discovered one of the creatures dead on the way over to the house, and they've brought along its body to dissect in an attempt to understand what it is. Frankie hypothesizes that the creature could be from outer space, but Pete is hostile to that idea and dismisses it as ignorance. Ellen reminds Pete that to make suppositions, scientists must have some imagination.At Bunny's house, Millie arrives and helps her set up for her guests; Bunny is unaware that the spawn have reached the house and are lurking in her kitchen. One of them gets into her food processor, tainting the vegetable sauce she is making. When her guests arrive, all of them older ladies, they are horrified when they taste the sauce with the dead spawn in it, and the arm-sized creatures suddenly come at them from all angles, biting at fingers and toes, latching onto their legs and arms like small leeches. The women fight back and smash and kill a number of the creatures, all of them barely escaping with their lives in Millie's car. Afterwards, the creatures are seen crawling all over the house.Back at the house, Pete, Ellen and Frankie seek out Uncle Herb to get his opinion on the strange creature they've found. They find Herb's body in the living room, with hundreds of spawn eating him from the inside out. The three-headed adult creature confronts them in the hallway, and they run upstairs to Charles's bedroom. Charles, who understands that the creature will chase after them because of the noise they are making, distracts it with a radio, which it eats. Before the creature can find Charles and kill him, the doorbell rings--Kathy has finally arrived at the house. Pete and the others try to warn her from an upstairs window, but she doesn't hear them and goes into the house anyway. The monster nearly grabs her in the hallway outside Charles' bedroom, but she escapes its huge mouth.Desperate to summon help, the teens devise a plan: they will make a dash for Pete's bedroom, where there is a telephone, and they'll call for help. But the monster ambushes them in the hallway. Pete runs to another room, Frankie and Kathy run upstairs to the attic, while Ellen stays in Charles' bedroom and slams the door. The creature, attracted by her shouting, knocks the door down and rushes at her. Before Ellen can escape out the window, the monster bites her head off and her headless body falls out into the front yard of the house.Pete climbs out onto the roof and sees Ellen's body on the ground below. He also notices his parents' car, still in the garage, meaning they never left. Kathy and Frankie see Ellen from the attic window, too, and Pete eventually climbs in through the small opening. He is in shock and is delirious, telling them ""Ellen's really scared. They never left."" When he tries to open the barricaded door, Frankie tries to stop him but Pete becomes unhinged, fighting with Frankie and screaming for Ellen. Frankie knocks him unconscious, but it's too late, as his shouting attracts the creature. Fortunately, Charles has concocted a plan. Rushing to his bedroom, he assembles a hollow head full of flash powder, embedding a frayed electrical cord in the explosive material.As the creature advances on Frankie and Kathy, Kathy is hysterical and screaming. Charles rushes up the stairs and tells them to be quiet, then he baits the creature with the fake head. At first it refuses to eat it, until Charles gets the idea to scream. The monster immediately devours the head; with the dangling power cord hanging just outside its mouth. Using extension cords, Charles lures the creature closer and closer until he is close enough to an electrical outlet to plug it in. However, one of the arm-sized spawn creatures lands on his right shoulder from the above rafter and begins biting into him. Charles is forced to use a screwdriver to stab at the spawn attached to his shoulder until the three-headed mother spawn approaches and inadvertently eats the wounded spawn creature from Charles' shoulder, thus freeing him. Charles manages to get at the extension cord and plugs it into an outlet, and the three-headed spawn creature instantly explodes in a gory shower of alien blood and body parts all over the attic interior.The threat no longer a secret, a massive hunt for the spawn has been mobilized at the house and the surrounding areas as dozens of townspeople converge on the area. Aunt Millie arrives back at the house and cares for the wounded and shaken Pete and Charles as best she can, while policemen and volunteers scour the surrounding woods and bushes for spawn, which they stun with cattle prods or stab with shovels, picks and axes. The creatures are dumped onto various bonfires that the locals set, and are disposed of, including the remains of the three-headed eight-foot mother spawn. Frankie and Kathy are also shaken but alive, and are taken away in an ambulance.In the final scene, several hours later, night falls. The house and the surrounding area, now deserted except for a posted patrolman, seems to have been cleared of all the aliens--that is, until the patrolman hears a rumbling in the ground. It seems as if an earthquake is hitting, until the entire hillside next to the house erupts with the head of a gigantic spawn, even larger than the house itself."

While still no more than a grown child, Piera -- in tight dresses -- goes with her mother for a threesome when she engages in sexual relations with other men and subsequently suffers both from poor health and the lack of a normal home. The shadow of the future already clouds the household when Eugenia is committed again and again to the psychiatric clinic. By the time Piera has become an adult, both of her parents are in separate mental hospitals -- and both (even the father) are still sexually eccentric, to say the least."
Without a Trace,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086593/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Estranged New Yorker (Kate Nelligan) turns to the police after her son disappears. This movie, centering on a child's abduction, casts Kate Nelligan as the distraught mother who lashes out at the police (in the person of a relentless detective played by Judd Hirsch), who treat her and her husband as suspects, even as she hounds them to find her child and drives away her husband (David Dukes) and friends (including Stockard Channing) with her intensity and single-mindedness.—alfiehitchie Susan Selky (Kate Nelligan) is a well-known English professor at Columbia University. She lives in a Brooklyn brownstone with her six-year-old son Alex (Danny Corkill). One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner.Susan returns home after a day of teaching, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late coming home. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris (Stockyard Channing), whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and finds out that Alex never got to school. The NYPD is immediately called and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti (Judd Hirsch). Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and police zero in on Susan's estranged husband Graham (David Dukes), a professor at NYU who hasn't been seen for hours. When Graham finally turns up, he produces an alibi, ruling him out as a suspect.Susan's case generates a lot of attention from the New York City media, with citizens helping in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan also takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles.Over the next few months, the investigation drags on and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he gets a ransom call. He heads to a location the caller directs him to, but is cornered and beaten, prompting a hospital stay.A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe (Keith McDermott), is arrested as a suspect. A pair of Alex's bloody underpants was found in his apartment, where the gay Philippe was picked up with a male prostitute. Susan visits Philippe in jail, and he tells her that the bloody underpants came about when he used them to stop bleeding after he cut himself washing dishes in Susan's house. Convinced Philippe is innocent, Susan tries to persuade Menetti to drop the charges, but he refuses, citing physical evidence he won't discuss.The renewed media coverage generated by Philippe's arrest dies down, and Susan is facing increased pressure to drop the matter and accept that Alex could be dead. Susan's feelings come to a boiling point when a magazine cancels an article she wrote about Alex (because a gay man was arrested) and even her friend Jocelyn tells her it's time to give up.Susan tries to resume her normal routine, although she never loses faith that her son is alive. One day, she receives a phone call from a woman in Bridgeport, Connecticut named Malvina Robbins (Louise Stubbs), who says Alex is alive and living with neighbors. Menetti tells Susan that he has also heard from Robbins, but Bridgeport police told him the woman is just a crank, or in Menetti's words, ""a lonely old booby"". The investigation is closed, he says, and Philippe goes on trial within weeks.On a day off, Menetti is taking a drive with his son (David Simon). When he sees a sign for Bridgeport, Connecticut, he decides to check out the lead personally. He recruits his young son as his partner on the case. Once he is sure that the lead is false, Menetti hopes to browbeat Robbins from ever disturbing Mrs. Selky ever again. When Menetti arrives at Robbins' address, he is shocked to see a blue Chevy (in which witnesses had reported seeing Alex) parked in the driveway of the neighboring house. Realizing that Robbins was telling the truth, he uses her phone to contact the Bridgeport police. They find Alex alive and unharmed. It turns out that Alex's kidnapper is a desperate man who took the boy off the street to help him care for his elderly and disabled mother in the house.Menetti drives Alex back to New York with a huge police escort, and the New York media is tipped off that he's been found, converging on Susan's Brooklyn house. Susan returns from grocery shopping in time to see Alex stepping out of Menetti's car. In front of delighted bystanders and reporters, mother and child are reunited."

He then goes to the top floor with the elevator machinery and finds the metal enclosure containing the microprocessor is empty.

In its last burst of madness, the computer shoots one of the broken cables out of the shaft, dragging the CEO into the shaft and hanging him. A shaken Felix and Mieke decide to take the stairs.

Bruno goes back outside again to the bushes, but by this time the killer is gone and there is blood drag marks on the grass. At Giovanni's house on the grounds, he finds blood on the back steps to his house. Bruno hears the music inside the villa turn off in which he returns and finds the diary with the pages torn out. When Bruno sees Giovanni's front door light come on, he goes to the other house and helps him as he carries a trash bag. Giovanni claims to Bruno that he is throwing away some old newspapers and magazines. Bruno asks Giovanni about the previous tenant Linda, and Giovanni says that he did not know her all that well. A few minutes later, Julia (Lara Naszinski), Bruno's actress girlfriend, arrives at the villa and tells Bruno and her rehearsal was canceled and she was the one who called earlier but something was wrong with the phone line.The next day, Bruno tells Julia about his strange night. After Julia leaves, Bruno goes to the cellar and finds a locked door. Tony arrives at the villa where Bruno asks him about the locked door and Tony says that it contains things that Lind left behind. Bruno asks what Linda was like and Tony says that she was a ""normal kind of girl"". Just then, Bruno gets a call from Sandra and asks to meet later.Later that afternoon, Angela (Fabiola Toledo) arrives at the villa and tells Bruno that she is looking for her live-in girlfriend Katia who did not come home last night. Angela tells Bruno that Katia came over to get her diary back. Bruno asks about Linda, and Angela says that Linda would let her and Katia come over to swim in the pool there. Bruno tells Angela that she can use the pool whenever she wants. Angela then goes to the pool house to change. Giovanni watches her while she swims. While Angela is diving underwater, she finds the cutter on the bottom of the pool. When Bruno leaves for the studio, Angela walks into the house, while an unseen person, wearing womens high-heeled shoes with a red skirt, blouse, and red-painted fingernails, takes a knife from the kitchen. Angela goes to the upstairs bathroom to change and to wash her hair in the bathtub. As she reaches for the shampoo, her hand is stabbed and pinned to the sink by the kitchen knife. The killer then puts a plastic bag over her head and repeatedly slams her head into the counter, while laughing maniacally. Angela mages to pull the knife out of her hand, but she is placed in the tub and her throat is slit. The killer then begins cleaning the floor and counter with tissues.At the studio, Bruno works and waits for Sandra to show up, which she never does. At the end of the day, Bruno returns to the villa. In the kitchen, Bruno sees that one of the kitchen knifes is not with the others. Going to the upstairs bathroom which is now clean, he finds an empty box of tissues, a cut on the counter, and a bloody piece of torn tissue paper on the floor. In the cellar, Bruno finds more bloody tissues under the locked door. Bruno records himself and talks of possibly uncovering a string of murders, beliving that Angela and Katia are dead.A little later, Sandra arrives and Bruno tells her what happened. Sandra mentions the killer not being able to move the bodies, and Bruno tells of a locked door in the cellar. Sandra says that she knows a Linda, but ""it couldn't be her"". They go down to the cellar where they find the door unlocked. When they find a large truck in the room which is filled with tennis balls, Sandra says that it must be the Linda she knew. She says that Linda as a child was the basis for the character in her film. They hear someone in the studio above. In the hallway, Bruno is nearly stabbed by a nervous Julia. After they settle down, Sandra leaves. Julia tells Bruno that the play she is appearing in was suspected due to obscenity charges.The next day, Sandra calls Linda and says that she is sorry for the way things turned out between them. She says that she used Lindas story in the movie, but it was mostly fabricated and says to Linda over the phone ""I didn't say anything"". The unseen Linda merely whispers and hangs up.At the villa, Bruno finds Julia listening to his tape and the two of them argue about the murders since Julia is skeptic that two murders have just taken place since there is no bodies or evidence of any fowl play. When Bruno asks Julia to go with him to the police, but she again thinks that there is no murderer lurking on the grounds. A little later, Bruno goes out and down the street to a payphone where he calls the director of the theater where Julia is working and asks about the charges of obscenity. The director tells Bruno that there are no obscenity charges for it is a children's play, and that Julia left on opening night without an explanation.At the studio, the unseen woman enters the editing room, takes out a film canister and begins to cut up the film reel. Bruno, at that very second, is meeting nearby with Carlo the editor and tries to persuade him to let him see the last reel. When they arrive in the editing room, the killer has quietly sneaked out and left behind the film which is cut to pieces.Back at the villa, Giovanni finds the dead bodies of Angela and Katia in his tool shed, but before he can do anything, he is hit on the head with a wrench.At the studio, Bruno and Carlo splice together as much of the damaged film as they can and watch the scene, which is shown of the two boys taunting the other boy to go down into the cellar, and suddenly during a splice a woman appears in the film with her back to the camera. Carlo says that it is probably the killer.At the villa, Sandra arrives to look for Linda and in the garage she finds a bearly living and bloody Giovanni. Linda jumps up from behind Sandra and wraps a film reel around Sandra and chokes her to death.A little while later, Julia arrives at the villa and enters the garage to find a dead Sandra beside a bundle of film reels. Just when, the garage door slams shut. Julia runs into the house looking for Bruno, and after being startled by tennis balls being thrown at her, hides in a closet in the cellar. She tries to keep the door shut as Linda pushes a knife through the door crack to force it open. Just then, Bruno arrives back at the villa and finding the bodies in the garage, enters the cellar and calls out for Linda. Julia jumps out of the closet and runs. Linda chases after her and stabs Julia in the back, killing her. Linda then runs towards Bruno screaming. Bruno grabs a brick and whacks Linda on the head who falls to the ground unconscious. Bruno exmines Julia on the floor and finds that she is already dead. Bruno walks back up to Linda who rises up with the knife and struggles with Bruno, who pulls at Linda's hair where a wig comes off and Bruno is face-to-face with... Tony. Tony swings the knife at Bruno who twists the knife in Tony/Linda's hand and stabs him with the knife. Tony/Linda falls to the floor and screams out: ""I am not a female!"" and then dies.In the final scene, Bruno watches the final scene in Sandra's film in its entirely where after the two boys run away after the bloody tennis ball flies up from the cellar at them, a woman figure walks back up the stairs and it is the little boy sent down the stairway... now adorned in a wig and dress. Bruno realizes that the sexually confused and frustrated Tony and invented the persona of Linda and had tried to cover up his secret by killing all those who knew him and his secret idenity."

After the freighter rendezvouses with Hawk's ship, the crew fight to save the life of a comrade wounded during the shootout. Meanwhile, Peter comes out of hiding and asks to be taken home.At first, Hawk considers ransoming the child, but during a skirmish with Company fighters, Hawk's feelings change when Peter courageously volunteers to squeeze into a tight compartment and fixes a damaged power conduit that allows them to escape. Hawk then promises to take Peter back to his home planet, Procyon III, with no strings attached. First however, Hawk's crew stop to rest at a space station owned by an alien crime lord named Zariatin (Ray Stewart).On Procyon III, Peter's father meets with The Company's security director who decides to track the boy down with their advanced robot ship; a massive, fully automated battle cruiser that can home in on an identity tag Peter wears around his neck.Back at Zariatin's station, a pair of bounty hunters spot Peter and realize he is a ""company kid"" worth a hefty ransom.

Peter manages to get away in an escape pod which is later picked up by Hawk once Flightplan senses he is still alive.Back on course to Regulus V, Hawk teaches Peter how to fire the ship's lasers using asteroids as target practice.

Peter then struggles to get Hawk back to his ship where they get away just moments before the station explodes.The robot ship sets its sights on Hawk's ship next, but unable to outrun it, Hawk tells Peter to fire the lasers the moment the robot ship lowers its defenses, which it must do to fire its weapons. Hawk closes in and Peter takes the shot successfully destroying the enemy ship. Peter's victory is short lived however, and he tries to save Hawk's life who has passed out in the pilot seat.

He is on a speaking tour to earn what little money he has, currently on an extended stop in Woodsmoke, Connecticut. His reputation in almost every sense precedes him in Woodsmoke--including his womanizing where probably only the husbands of his conquests are unaware of what's going on, and his excessive drinking.

An aspiring country/western singer, whose money is disappearing faster than his career opportunities, enters a ""Tough Man"" amateur boxing contest to earn some cash to pay his bills. Amazingly enough, he wins it, and is picked to go onto the national finals. He's torn between his first love, music, and the glitz, glamor and money of the ""Tough Man"" world.—frankfob2@yahoo.com At Torreyson's nightclub in Fort Worth, Texas, fight promoters James Neese (Warren Oates) and Tony Fallon (Bruce McGill) judge a wet T-shirt contest. They select three young women to serve as ""ring girls"" at the following night's ""Toughman"" event, in which amateur boxers compete for a $5,000 prize. Afterward, country singer Art Long (Dennis Quaid) takes the stage, but his performance is interrupted by a group of hecklers. Art knocks out all three with a single punch as the crowd cheers in approval. He returns home to his wife, Caroline (Carlene Watkins), who suggests he forsake his musical aspirations and focus on his lucrative job as a tree-trimmer. Art storms out of the apartment and spends the night playing his guitar.In the morning, Art vents his frustration to his father, Bill Long (Wilford Brimley), who agrees with Caroline. However, Art believes he is too young to abandon his dream and chooses to quit his job instead. To earn money, he enters the Toughman contest, and is dubbed ""the Country and Western Warrior"" by James Neese. Art telephones Caroline to say he will be home late with no further explanation, but assures her that their marriage is not in jeopardy.At the Cowtown Coliseum, Art meets fellow musician Paul Thomas ""P. T."" Coolidge (Stan Shaw) in the locker room. P. T. compliments Art on the previous night's performance and gives him advice on how to win the Toughman competition. As the event begins, Neese introduces the 32 contestants, sixteen of whom will compete the following night for the local championship. Both Art and P. T. emerge as finalists, but when Art returns home, Caroline expresses concern that he is risking his life. Their toddler son, Christopher (Christopher Norris), interrupts, saying he had a nightmare, and Art comforts the boy with a humorous song.The next day, Neese and Fallon determine Art to be their most ""marketable"" contestant and decide to eliminate P. T., the only serious contender, on a technicality. Although P. T. is disappointed by the decision, he coaches Art to victory against an Albanian giant named Tigran Baldasarian (Steve 'Monk' Miller). However, when Art collects the prize money, he declines Neese's offer to enter the national championship in Detroit, Michigan, for a prize of $100,000. Neese argues that Art has commercial appeal, and promises him the opportunity to sing on national television. Art is skeptical until the promoter explains that he needs ""a singing Toughman"" to sway public opinion against the politicians and boxing commissioners who oppose the competition.Outside the Coliseum, Art encounters P. T. and his girl friend, Myra (Pam Grier). He invites P. T. to coach him in Detroit for a percentage of the winnings, and Myra, a Detroit native, offers to board them at her family's home. Myra and P. T. spend the night in Art's van, while Art shares the news of his victory with Caroline. She is overjoyed at seeing the prize money, and despite her opposition to boxing, she agrees to make the trip to Detroit.In the morning, Caroline leaves the apartment to run errands while Art sleeps.

T. 20 percent of the prize money. After leaving Christopher with his grandparents, the four travel to Detroit, where Art and Caroline join Neese on a television talk show with several other contestants and their spouses.

The next day, Art signs a contract with Crystal Records, prompting Caroline to suggest he forfeit the championship. When Art refuses, Caroline accuses him of having a violent nature and refuses to support his decision. That evening, Art defeats three opponents before facing a powerful contender named Truman Wall. Neese advises Art to intentionally lose the fight or risk serious injury, which would reflect badly on the promoters. He produces a copy of Art's recording contract and reveals that Crystal Records is a subsidiary of James Neese Enterprises. Despite his disillusionment, Art is determined to face his opponent.As he enters the ring, Art is reassured by the sight of Caroline seated with his father, Bill, in the stands. During the opening round, Art's concentration is compromised as he composes a song in his head. He endures two punishing rounds until the song is complete, then knocks out Truman Wall in the third.

The corpse plays Draupadi and the vile Duryodhana, who orders the disrobing in the original version, ends up pledging to save Draupadi's honor at any cost. To make things even more hilarious, a new act - that of the ill-fated romance of Salim and Anarkali - is introduced, with the corpse playing Anarkali.In the end, the police arrives and Vinod and Sudhir present their evidence to the police officer, and it seems as though Tarneja will be arrested. Srivastava, being the Assistant Municipal Commissioner tells the officer to wait a few minutes before arresting Tarneja. Tarneja tells Ahuja and Shobha that if he goes to jail, he would make sure that their malpractices are also exposed. In a twist ending, they all come to an agreement and Srivastava manages to pin the murder of Commissioner D'Mello and the collapse of the bridge on Vinod and Sudhir.

Unfortunately, that may prove to be next to impossible. Drame psychologique qui traite du sujet délicat de l'inceste. Le film fut présenté à la Quinzaine des réalisateurs du Festival de Cannes en 1983 et au 13ème New Directors/New Films Festival à New York.. - - Note de l'auteure: ''J'ai été sensibilisée à l'inceste père-fille par le récit que m'en fit une femme. Son mal de vivre d'adolescente et de femme adulte était une conséquence directe et malheureuse de cette expérience. Son récit eut l'effet de me bouleverser autant que de susciter ma curiosité. J'eus donc l'idée d'en faire un film pour raconter, à ma façon, la douloureuse agonie de l'amour d'une adolescente pour son père''. - - Analyses: Brigitte Sauriol s'attaque à la réalité de l'inceste, c'est-à-dire à ce qui se passe vraiment dans la majorité des cas, quand une ou des petites filles sont en butte aux sollicitations de leur père, dans une famille moyenne. Brigitte Sauriol a fait ici un film de dénonciation, sans fioritures et sans romantisme. L'ensemble est cru, basé sur une recherche exhaustive du phénomène de l'inceste chez nous et ailleurs. Rien qu'un jeu est la somme des points les plus communs des divers témoignages recueillis. (Texte de Françoise Wéra, paru dans La Vie en rose, novembre 1983, p. 57) - - - 'Just a Game', has been indifferently acted, and its screenplay is predictable.

John Wainwright, Ph.D. [Larry Hankin] has written a book on reincarnation [The Second Coming of Svengali] which is fitting, as Wainwright claims to be the reincarnation of the famous hypnotist. Wainwright has been invited by Hadley Radcliff [John Carradine], leader of the Society of the Occult, to give a demonstration of his hypnotic powers (and sell a few books). In attendance is Radcliff's friend, Steven Elliot, [Donald Barry] and Elliot's daughter Stephanie [Susan McIver], who is pining the recent death of her mother, Valerie. Valerie died under mysterious circumstances, her blood drained and with two puncture wounds on her throat. Stephanie is attempting to get Wainwright to help her contact her dead mother, but Wainwright does not wish to be bothered. Later that evening, however, Stephanie pays a visit to Wainwright at his home. Caught off-guard, Wainwright/Svengali finally agrees to help Stephanie. He hypnotizes her and promises her that she will be the instrument of revenge upon the one who killed her mother. Stephanie goes home and begins to perform satanic rituals and speak as though she is possessed. Worried about his daughter's mental state, Elliot calls in psychiatrist Anatole Gregorio (Dracula) [Geoffrey Land] who promises that he can be of more help to Stephanie than that charlatan Wainwright.Wainwright, in the meantime, is busy wining and dining Trilby [Jane Brunel-Cohen], a dancer he met at a nightclub and who is supposedly a pure soul with great psychic powers and the one for whom the cult has been searching for 60 years in order to give them the psychic power to sustain their many reincarnations. Wainwright has been selected as the host body for Svengali, and it is Svengali's duty to prepare Trilby for the ritual in which she will be sacrificed to the horned beast. But there is a problem. Wainwright is falling in love with Trilby and is attempting to reclaim his body from Svengali.Cut to the Dracula/Stephanie storyline. After a few scenes in which Dracula gets the girl, he reunites Stephanie with her mother, who is now a vampire. But it is not the happy reunion of mother and daughter. Valerie is jealous of Stephanie's presence and tells her to go away. Stephanie is horrified to see what her mother has become.Cut back to the Wainwright storyline. Wainwright tries to exorcise Svengali by ""using the weaknesses of Svengali's soul,"" which means that Wainwright plies himself with booze. When their bodies separate, Wainwright goes to Trilby to warn her that Svengali means to kill her. His parting words are, ""If you ever see me again, don't look into my eyes."" Of course, the next time she sees Wainwright/Svengali (in her rearview mirror),
she is mesmerized by his eyes.Tonight is to be Trilby's sacrifice. All of the reincarnated cult members (actually those from the Society of the Bleeding Rose, an ancient cult) are looking forward to Trilby's sacrifice, which means that they will be able to maintain their existence. Trilby lays on the altar as each of the cult members come forward to kiss her. In turn, Wainwright, Stephanie, Gregorio...When it becomes Radcliff's turn to kiss Trilby, he notices that she is already dead and declares Dr Gregorio a traitor. Svengali pits his powers against those of Dracula by holding up two candles in the form of a cross. Dracula knocks the candles out of Svengali's hands, and Dracula and Stephanie leave the enclave as the reincarnations lay dying.Dracula explains to Stephanie that the cult had no power. They died because, in their minds, they expected to die. Not even Trilby's sacrifice would have helped them. Dracula then offers Stephanie a life with the same powers he has bestowed upon her mother. Stephanie refuses to live like her mother--a lost soul with her life drained out--and blows up the car, killing both herself and Dracula. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

They tell the adopted child that he must no longer associate with them which the child doesn't understand and fights against. The hired couple try to console the child and take him to live with them.The Nazis come and take the couple to the concentration camps and (presumably) execute them. The child is left behind, the living embodiment of the revenge (which in this case is love) the elderly couple had against the Nazis and their unforgivable cruelty.I found this a powerfully moving film and heard that it was the story of the child hood of the director.

After his mentally challenged brother is taken to a mental institution due to an attempted strangling, the Illusionist starts a journey to rescue him from being lobotomized. At the center of this extremely visualized narrative are the illusionist and his brother, who is lazy on the basis of either great love, or exorbitant envy of the brother. Having spoiled the sick son in a psychiatric hospital, the mother blesses the illusionist on a long journey with one suitcase. The ensuing whirlwind of events drags the heroes deeper into his turbulent whirlpool. An unnamed teen boy (Freek De Jonge, only referred to as ""the Illusionist"" in the closing credits) enters a dream-like sequence and sees himself as a performer in a dressing room. He shortly spots his mentally challenged brother, named Tjibbe (Jim van der Woude), in the mirror. He goes on stage to perform, but Tjibbe sabotages the performance by disconnecting the microphone. The illusionist is booed by the colorful audience and escapes through a large box. He suddenly sees a flashback of Tjibbe in a mental hospital.Living in a windmill in rural The Netherlands, mother (Catrien Wolthuizen) is sewing, grandfather lies in bed and the Illusionist and his brother enjoy fishing with their father (Gerard Thoolen). During praying before dinner, Tjibbe is swatting flies and carefully collects and cleans their dead bodies.Tjibbe is teased and attacked by children in the nearby village.

Tjibbe, nearby, scares a little girl by making funny faces at her, angering the girls family. He flees and looks for his brother. After finding him, the Illusionist tries to comfort him with a hug.

At the funeral, the Illusionist has a flashback about the lobotomies at the institution and decides to run away to rescue Tjibbe.He sneaks onto the hospital roof and through a window spots Tjibbe, who is entertaining other patients. All of the patients have scars or bandages on their foreheads, as has Tjibbe. Mother suddenly appears and she and Tjibbe spot the Illusionist through the window. Tjibbe wants to move towards his brother but is taken away by nurses. The Illusionist is taken home by mother.Back home, mother dresses up as the magicians lady assistant and tries to get attention from the Illusionist, showing that she too is now deranged.

After shortly ignoring her, the illusionist gives in and pushes one of the knives into the box, killing her.Startled by this, he runs away while the windmill starts to fall apart. Grandfather, who happens to be on TV singing in a choir, waves to the camera as the windmill collapses.The Illusionist returns to the dream-like sequence from the beginning of the film, entering the box he used to escape it.

He falls over in the mud gaining a head injury. Tjibbe picks him up and they walk onto a stage where they are both applauded by an audience. In a confused state they enter a dressing room. Tjibbe takes care of the Illusionists head wound and removes his own lobotomy scar, revealing that it is a fake.The Illusionist now starts to strangle Tjibbe as the sound of their laughing father can be heard. A fly on the family photo is swatted, breaking the photo frame."

Papa Can Her Your Me Sing,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085388/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A poor army veteran in Taiwan adopts a daughter. She grows up and leaves him to enter show business. When she becomes famous she shuns her father and friends. A speech-impaired and poor army veteran in Taiwan adopts a daughter, who later leaves him to enter show business. Her departure leaves the veteran in a state of depression, as she meant the entire world to him. Fame has gotten the best of the girl, who later shuns her father and friends.—Oliver Chu So many things-love, family, friendships, and sometimes, self-respect-have been sacrificed through the ages just so someone can perform in a Greek tragedy, play Hamlet, be in the movies or on TV, step on a Broadway stage, or take the first steps to becoming an international singing sensation. We know that the satisfaction derived from the applause, the awards, the fans, the glamor, etc. must be tremendous...but is it worth it?The publicity blitz launching the new film in Taiwan featured its big musical scenes-production numbers reminiscent of Grease and Fame, and even of a Las Vegas stage show. These segments, though certainly flashy and eye-catching, actually comprise only a small part of the story, which begins in a glamorized version of Taiwan's yesteryear shantytowns, poverty communities similar to the ""Hoovervilles"" of the U.S. depression era. In recent years, most of these have been torn down by the government and their residents relocated to apartment-style public housing facilities.As the story starts, however, there lives in one such shantytown a garbage collector whom the neighbors know as ""Mute Uncle"" (actor Suen Yue). Back in mainland China, years ago, he was knifed in the neck during a battle with the Communists. Ever since, he has not spoken a word. Now he lives in a shack with a front wall made entirely of the wine bottles he has collected. In the morning sunshine, the wall glistens in rainbow colors.""Mute Uncle,"" however, is up and out the door long before the sun arises. He kisses his common-law wife goodbye and begins peddling his cart around the neighborhood in search of discarded bottles and such. Early one morning, he hears a crying sound by the roadside and notes a message tucked in the blanket enveloping the infant herald: It bestows the gods' blessings on the kind person who'll take over the care of the baby. Mute Uncle picks Ah-mei up and takes her home.Thus begins Papa-Can You Hear Me Sing, a movie which falls quite naturally into two parts: Part I-growing up and stardom, and Part II-more of the ""show biz."" The happenings surrounding Ah-mei's early life in Part I are notably more touching and humorous than the ups-and-downs of her later singing career.Mute Uncle brings infant Ah-mei into a close-knit, Peyton Place-like society full of interesting characters. There are hard-working parents, peddlers, shopkeepers, restaurant owners, drunks, naughty children and priests, police, and the many other who live in or pass through such dingy worlds.This is, however, not the stereotypical view usually presented of such a community; everything is not black or white, and the characters themselves are multidimensional-they have strengths, desires, and joys as well as weaknesses, human passions, and sorrows. Furthermore, no judgement is made about who is better or worse. It is just fact that many different kinds of people are trying to survive in this world as best they can.Ah-mei's presence brings havoc to her new found home. Her incessant crying is the straw that drives out Mute Uncle's live-in girlfriend, who's been on the edge of leaving her ""dumb"" companion for quite some time. From then on, Mute Uncle focuses all his attention and hopes on his adopted daughter; Ah-mei grows into a very pretty little girl with a round face, big eyes, and cute pigtails.Because her foster father later brings her to school on his garbage cart, little Ah-mei becomes a frequent object of other students' ridicule and mistreatment. Luckily, she has the protection of her classmate and neighbor, Ah-ming, who treats her like his little sweetheart; unfortunately, the feeling is not reciprocated.Some say that misfortunes occur in groups of three. And, even if so, a neighbor's wife (Chiang Hsia) now gets involved in a larger share than anyone could possibly deserve. In a single evening, she loses her husband, her brother, and her home. Coming home drunk and victorious after a night of gambling, the husband stumbles along with presents for the family and neighbors. Crossing a bridge, he accidentally loses his grip on a doll he has bought for his little neighbor, Ah-mei, and follows it into the dark, murky waters below his wife cuts her finger while chopping onions. Accident or omen, she wonders, when a neighbor runs in hysterically to tell her that her husband is dead. She rushes out, without putting out the fire under the exploding suddenly flames, ending the life of her brother and burning down her shack and neighboring homes but meanwhile, she has reached her husband's body. The way she looks at him, holds his head, scolds him, caresses him and ponders why the gods have taken him disarray death fire dangerous exploding broke out collapses dying victim passed away by Jonathan, is surely one of the most emotionally touching film performances in recent memory. Actress Chiang Hsia's sorrow is full of intelligence and nuance returning to the reality that surrounds her-fireman, hysteria, confusion and crying-she clings to the one thing she has left, her son. But fate owes one more misfortune scream to cries fatal tries son bad defeat grew to mother screen fades to black.Twenty years later, screen fades from black she loses her son when he and others try to keep demolition teams from tearing down their shacks-he is killed in the collapse of a two-story house. Chiang Hsia's performance at the funeral service is, again, notably touching.Another very moving rendition is the continuous portrayal of Mute Uncle by veteran actor Suen Yue opening reading daily newspaper this morning. One remembers his ecstatic joy (hearing Ah-mei's first spoken word), his portrayal of extreme loneliness (on losing Ah-mei to her passion for becoming a famous singing star), and his show of great personal courage (always offering a sincere smile, even when being humiliated because of his inability to speak).In the second part of the film, Ah-mei (actress Linda Liu) is on the way to becoming a Far Eastern singing sensation.

The cheerless events on the last night in the existence of a little suburban Houston pub. It has to be closed down for development reasons but one of the regular customers, Cowboy, seems to have friends in high places.—Theo de Grood <tdg@xs4all.nl> Set during one long Friday afternoon and evening at the Alamo, a long-standing working class dive bar on the outskirts of Houston, Texas. The local regulars gather for the final night before the place is closed down to make room for a high-rise development. Ichabod (Steven Matilla), whose real name is William, and his long-suffering girlfriend Mary (Tina Bess-Hubbard) arrive, engaged in a heated argument as they make their way to the pool table. Another customer, named Claude (Lou Perryman), arrives where he complains that his wife Marcie banished him from the house when he came home drunk one too many times. After ranting that Marcie is overly preoccupied with housekeeping, purchasing household gadgets, and making a good impression with the neighbors, he calls her from the bar's payphone several times over the course of the movie and pleads to be allowed to return home. He eventually hangs up, as the conversation only leads to more frustration.When two attractive newcomers, named Ginger (Peggy Pinnell) and Lisa (Amanda Lamar), walk in, the men at the bar immediately invite them over to buy them a drink. Claude tells a story about his friend, Cowboy Regan (Sonny Carl Davis), a popular regular at the Alamo who has a gift for charming women and creating drama. Meanwhile, Skipper (George Pheneger), the bartender, breaks up a fight between Ichabod and another customer.When Cowboy finally arrives, Ichabod and others are glad to see him. Self-assured, Cowboy is not worried about quitting another construction job, since he believes he would be better suited as a movie actor. Cowboy flirts with Lisa, claiming he might be able to save the Alamo from developers. Nearby, Steve (J. Michael Hammond) overhears and comments that Cowboy is merely boasting.In the poolroom, Cowboy agrees to loan Ichabod $50 to take Mary to the Paradise Motel. Next, Cowboy goes outside to reassure Claude, who continues to complain about Marcie and her materialistic obsession with buying stuff. They say hello to Janice (Doris Hargrave), an acquaintance from high school who lives in the small house next door to the Alamo. Referring to her promiscuous reputation, Cowboy tells Claude she is ""a dirty leg"". After listening to Claude's marital problems, Cowboy encourages his friend to consider working in the movie industry with him, but Claude reminds Cowboy that he has a family to support.Back inside the bar, Cowboy wins a tequila chugging contest against Hector (Earnest Huerta Jr.) , but when he loses the next challenge to Poke (David Schied), Steve taunts Cowboy about pretending to be a hero and saving the bar. Determined to prove Steve wrong, Cowboy uses the payphone and leaves an urgent message for his former college roommate, Representative Richard Waters, at the state capital in Austin, Texas. He tells Claude that he might have to fight Steve, who has been pestering him all night.During all of this, Claude remains preoccupied with Marcie, who now wants her husband to check into a motel for a few days. Cowboy resumes his flirtation with Lisa and invites her to listen to music in his truck. She accepts, despite objections from her friend, Ginger, who does not want to be left alone at the bar. In his pickup truck, Cowboy brags about his acting ability, but is unable to remember the title of the movie Western for which he is supposedly being considered. Cowboy kisses Lisa, and she leaves, noting he has the wrong impression of her.Frustrated, Cowboy remains in the parking lot kicking dirt, when Steve approaches. He taunts Cowboy, declaring that Lisa must have fled after realizing the hero was bald underneath his hat. Cowboy takes off his hat to reveal his bald spot, punches Steve, and a fight ensues. After knocking Steve to the ground, Cowboy staggers inside Janice's house. She tends to the cut on his lip, but when he tries to seduce her, she orders him to leave, yelling that she knows Cowboy and other men call her a dirty leg.Meanwhile, a intoxicated Ichabod stands on the bar counter and announces to everyone that they are invited to watch him and Mary make love at the Paradise Motel. Barely able to stand, Ichabod is escorted by some of the patrons to his truck, and Mary drives him away.Inside, Skipper warns Cowboy about causing trouble and behaving as if he is superior to everyone else. As Steve expresses doubt about Representative Waters, Cowboy suggests they set up a blockade against the bulldozers, but no one wants to risk being arrested. Cowboy argues that the Alamo represents the real Texas, amid the encroachment of fast food chains, condominiums, and fancy saloons with mechanical bulls. As more of the patrons leave for the night, either to go home or to go to the B&B, a new and upscale bar several miles down the road, an increasingly drunken Cowboy yells to the departing patrons that they are traitors for going to the upscale ""Yankee bar"".A little while later, Waters telephones, but the politician tells Cowboy (off-camera) that he is unable to prevent the demolition. Cowboy grabs his rifle and challenges the remaining regulars at the bar, Poke, Steve, Willie (Henry Wideman), and Lionel (Kim Henkel), to defend the place.
Meanwhile, Claude drives home after calling his wife and threatening to burn down their house.After Steve insults him again, Cowboy fires a gunshot to prove he is serious. Annoyed, Skipper declares the place is closed and orders everyone to leave. However, Cowboy is determined to stay. Willie, the local drunkard, is the only one who agrees to remain behind and help Cowboy protect the bar, but he soon abandons the idea.Returning to the Alamo, Claude finds the besotted Cowboy dozing inside. He tells Cowboy that he followed through on his threat and set fire to his house. However, as Claude prepares to take Cowboy home, he learns from Marcie that the fire department arrived in time to save the place. Cowboy comments to Claude about the closing of the Alamo as the end to their ""redneck"" way of life. Claude then drives Cowboy home.In the final scene, Ichabod and Mary (still arguing with each other) drive back to the bar after the motel manager had apparently ejected them from their room due to Ichabod's drunken antics. It is here that Mary finally breaks up with Ichabod and drives off in his truck, while he runs after her on foot. While Steve, Poke, and Lionel laugh at the bickering couple, the lights of the Alamo are turned off for good."

Ravnovesie,1983,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0232521/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A social and psychological study of contemporary problems. A film crew arrives at the seaside to shoot a film entitled Equilibrium. Neither the actors nor the director can figure out precisely why the scriptwriter has chosen this title. Milko, a driver working for the film crew, dreams of taking part in automobile races; his wife Elena is the cashier of the production. Maria, an assistant to the director, comes between them. The story intertwines ordinary daily lives with the world of filmmaking into a drama ending with Elena's suicide. The film crew witness this drama silently. Yet the shooting of the film and its story suddenly recede in importance before the real-life drama, a drama for which these people prove unprepared and which disturbs their inner equilibrium. To some this is an unpleasant episode that must be forgotten as quickly as possible, but to others, such as the scriptwriter and the director, it provides an occasion to re-evaluate their own lives and the films they have been making. They are shaken by the revelation that they have allowed life to pass them by in hiding from reality behind empty phrases and making pointless films. It turns out the equilibrium that everybody aspires to may all too easily turn into unconcern. At whose expense do we achieve our own equilibrium?—Anonymous The story revolves round a film production. In a town at the Black Sea coast, a film crew is shooting a movie. The screenwriter and the director of the 'film within a film' are shooting some pretentious trash involving a large crew. The relations between the members of the group are very strained and can have damaging consequences. They all witness a genuine human drama, which unfolds between the driver in the production, Milko, and his sensitive wife Elena, who is the cashier of the crew. The 'other woman' is the assistant director Maria - a beautiful and frivolous girl. In the familiar love triangle three people are futilely searching for balance in their personal and social lives. Milko and Maria are hiding behind a false self-confidence while Elena refuses to turn her back on Milko's adultery, which he sees as a weakness, and escape in a light-hearted love affair. Elena, too, is unable to fight against the current and commits suicide. The shooting of the movie goes on, though for the screenwriter and the director this is a reason for serious thought. They ask themselves whether they succeed in reflecting on the real problems of the people in their works. The human drama faces film people with fundamental question about truth and falsehood in art. The film is successful marriage of observations on various social strata and the confession-like tone of the filmmakers.—Georgi Djulgerov <georgidjul1943@gmail.com>"

Chief Parks (Ed Lauter) is unenthusiastic about the arrest, reminding Frank that Goldy has always avoided conviction in the past. As Frank and his partner, Davis (John Saxon), leave the station, they encounter Goldy in the parking lot, accompanied by his lawyer, Henry Hoffa (Chelcie Ross), who warns Frank to ""stop harassing"" his client. The heated exchange ends with Frank assaulting Hoffa. Parks demands that Frank apologize to the lawyer, but the detective refuses. Frank seeks comfort from his estranged wife, Angi (Nancy Wilson), a nightclub singer, with whom he maintains a sexual relationship. Although Angi knows Frank is using her, she finds him hard to resist.The next day, Park assigns Frank and Davis to intercept a large shipment of cocaine that is on its way to Chicago. The detectives arrest small-time drug dealer Cheech Jones (James Spinks) for possession of cocaine, and he offers information on the shipment in exchange for his freedom.

All of the drug dealers are killed in the ensuing gunfight, except for Goldy, who escapes on foot with the briefcase. With Frank in pursuit, Goldy hides the money in the trunk of an abandoned car, before the detective kills him in self-defense.The next day, Parks advises Frank to recover the money or face a grand theft charge.

Davis suggests questioning residents of the surrounding houses, but Frank anticipates little or no cooperation.Frank spends the night with Angi, and is summoned to Parks's office the next morning, where he is put on suspension until the missing briefcase can be located. Despite the chief's assurance that Frank has the support of his superiors, the detective believes he has been ""presumed guilty"" and voices his resentment. Koslo and Jumbo abduct Cheech, who is promised his freedom if he confesses to being an informant. That evening, Mayfield receives word of Frank's suspension and, assuming that Frank has the money, orders Koslo to recover it.When Cheech's mutilated body is discovered by police, a fellow detective warns Frank that he could be next.

Frank shoots the man in cold blood, then proceeds to track down the other two assailants.Upon arriving at Jumbo's home, Frank battles three henchmen while the killer escapes. Frank returns to Angi's house, where he receives a threatening phone call from Mayfield.

While Frank eliminates Jumbo and the henchmen, Easy blows up the gang's getaway car, but Koslo catches Easy in the act and holds him at gunpoint. When Frank appears, he promises Koslo the briefcase if Easy is released. Koslo complies and Frank throws him the briefcase, which contains a live grenade. After the police arrive, Frank tells Detective New that he intends to pay Mayfield a visit.
