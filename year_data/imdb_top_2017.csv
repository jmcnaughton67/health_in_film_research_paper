Jedi Master-in-hiding Luke Skywalker unwillingly attempts to guide young hopeful Rey in the ways of the force, while Leia, former princess turned general, attempts to lead what is left of the Resistance away from the ruthless tyrannical grip of the First Order.—Danny Moniz Continuing whereStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)left off,Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)sees The Resistance striving to stay ahead of The First Order. Rey seeks guidance from Jedi-in-hiding Luke Skywalker so she can learn the ways of The Force, and defected storm-trooper FN-2187 (Finn) will have his faith in The Resistance tested as his past with The First Order comes to haunt not only him, but also threatens the very foundations of the galaxy's future.—Johnny Following the battle of Starkiller Base, General Leia Organa leads Resistance forces to flee D'Qar when a First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought, but after the Resistance escapes to hyperspace, the First Order tracks them and attacks the Resistance convoy. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his wing-men destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance leadership and incapacitating Leia, who survives by using the Force. Disapproving of new leader Vice Admiral Holdo's passive strategy, Poe helps Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose Tico embark on a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device.. The opening crawl from this latest film 'Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi' reads that the First Order is plotting to seize military control of the galaxy. A team of Resistance fighters led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) are planning an evacuation from their main base as Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) forces are coming for them. The Resistance holds out hope that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) will return to bring hope.The opening scene shows Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and the droid BB-8 are flying over the First Order's dreadnought as General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) orders his men to fire upon Poe and the Resistance's base. Other fighters head in for the attack. Poe orders a fighter, Paige (Veronica Ngo), to drop the payload onto the dreadnought. The fighters take heavy hits, and Paige is knocked away from her remote. With mere moments before the First Order obliterates the Resistance, Paige is able to grab the remote and drop all their bombs down on the dreadnought, completely destroying it at the cost of her life. The rest of the fighters go into hyperspace to escape.Aboard the First Order ship, a hologram of Snoke reprimands Hux for failing to stop the evacuation. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) enters the meeting. Snoke notes that, in spite of Kylo killing his father, Han Solo, he may still turn to the light side of the Force. Although Kylo protests, Snoke doesn't have faith in him. On his way down the elevator, Kylo smashes his helmet to pieces in rage.Meanwhile, former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) wakes up from his coma after his light-saber battle with Kylo. Poe finds him and is happy to see him. The first thing Finn asks is for Rey (Daisy Ridley).Rey has just arrived on the planet Ahch-To with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) on the Millenium Falcon to find Luke. She hands him his light-saber, but he just callously tosses it over his shoulder. Confused, Rey follows Luke, but he doesn't want to see her or know who she is and why she has sought him out. She tells him that Leia sent her to find him. Chewie breaks down the door to Luke's hut. Luke then asks Chewie where Han is.Leia demotes Poe as a result of his actions with the dreadnought. Moments later, the First Order ship catches up to the Resistance after tracking their hyper-speed. The First Order deploys their TIE fighters to attack. Kylo flies in in his own TIE fighter and prepares to launch the killing strike against the Resistance leaders, but he pulls back after sensing Leia on board. The other TIE fighters fire upon them, causing a blast that sucks the rebel leaders into space to their deaths. Leia pulls herself back to the ship using the Force, but she goes unconscious.Rey and Kylo begin to feel a connection in which they can see and communicate with each other. With Luke still not wanting to have anything to do with the Force or the Jedi, R2 plays him Leia's original message to Obi-Wan Kenobi to persuade Luke to help (from the first Star Wars film 'A New Hope'). Luke senses Rey's power and eventually agrees to give her lessons in the way of the Jedi and why it must end.With Leia out of commission, Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) assumes command of the Resistance. Meanwhile, Finn attempts to hop on an escape pod. He is found by mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who is mourning Paige, her sister. Rose is a big fan of Finn, seeing him as a Resistance hero. However, she zaps him with her taser when she realizes he's trying to escape. Finn notes that the First Order is tracking them through hyper-speed, and they can't make another jump because they are dangerously low on fuel, and the First Order will find them anyway. With Poe's help, they contact Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) for assistance, but she is in the middle of a fierce battle. She does tell them that she knows a code-breaker on Canto Bight that can help them, and they need to find him wearing a particular symbol.Rey's first lesson sees Luke attempting to show her to feel the Force and control it. Rey is able to see visions and manipulate small pebbles as she achieves balance. However, she soon sees a vision of herself being pulled toward a dark pit, with Luke trying to break her out of it. The pit spews water and snaps Rey out of the vision. Luke says she saw the dark side of the Force, and she didn't even try to stop herself. He tells her he has seen something like this once before, and it didn't scare him then as it does now. This is why he considers the ways of the Jedi to be a failure.Finn, Rose, and BB-8 arrive at a casino on Canto Bight. Finn is impressed with the glitz and wealth of the casino, but Rose hates the place because only the weapons dealers who sell to the Empire are rich enough to gamble there. It is also home to a number of rotten people who take pleasure in misdeeds, including cruelty to giant but gentle creatures called fathiers that are forced to race, and enslaved children who live with them in the stables as caretakers. The trio finds the Master Codebreaker (Justin Theroux) playing at a table, but the heroes get captured and thrown into a jail cell for illegally parking their ship. In their cell, Finn and Rose meet a stuttering scoundrel named DJ (Benicio Del Toro). He overhears the two of them needing a code-breaker, and he offers his services. DJ manages to open their cell and helps them escape, and they climb down to the stable. Rose, fascinated by the beautiful fathiers, stops to free one from its stable and finds a small boy inside. Frightened, he nearly pushes a panic button but Rose shows him her ring with the Resistance's symbol. They fight guards on the way out with the help of BB-8 and ride the fathiers as they stampede through the casino to get away. Finn and Rose's ship is destroyed but BB-8 and DJ bring them another one to make their escape.Luke mentions that the last time he saw Kylo Ren as his student, he had attempted to kill him by collapsing his hut on him. As Rey and Kylo continue to connect, Kylo tells Rey that Luke saw the power growing in Kylo and had attempted to get rid of him before he got stronger.Holdo starts to set in motion plans to evacuate the Resistance ship to a nearby Resistance stronghold, the planet Crait. Poe believes she is doing something wrong, and he attempts to stage a mutiny. Before his plans can go into effect, Leia appears after waking up and she incapacitates Poe. Leia allows Holdo's plan to go ahead.Rey confronts Luke over what Kylo told him. They engage in a brief fight before she asks if he really tried to kill Kylo. Luke explains that he sensed nothing but great darkness in Kylo, with no hope of him turning back. He did consider killing him but backed out of it, only for Kylo to see him with the light-saber and respond with a counterattack. Rey decides to leave Ahch-To with Chewie and R2. Luke walks by the tree containing sacred Jedi texts when he is met by a familiar face...YODA (voice of Frank Oz). He destroys the tree with a lightning bolt, to Luke's dismay. Yoda's spirit tells Luke to help Rey before she is also lost to the dark side. Luke considers himself a failure, but, in the words of Yoda, ""The greatest teacher, failure is.""Meanwhile, Finn, Rose, and DJ make it to the First Order's ship. Unfortunately, they are captured by Captain Phasma (Gwendolyn Christie) and her goons, with DJ having told the villains Finn and Rose's plan in order to gain monetary compensation. At the same time, Rey arrives on the same ship and is taken prisoner by Kylo Ren.Kylo brings Rey to Snoke. Rey tries to get Kylo to abandon the dark side, but Snoke taunts Rey as she tries to fight back. Snoke reveals that he created the connection between her and Kylo in an attempt to destroy Luke. Snoke attempts to get Kylo to kill Rey with his light-saber, but Kylo uses Luke's light-saber to impale Snoke and cut him in half. Rey and Kylo then fight Snoke's soldiers and slaughter them all. Kylo, now fully taken over by the dark side, tries to get Rey to join him, but she refuses and tries to get him on the Resistance side. Kylo attempts to manipulate Rey when mentioning her parents. Despite her trying to forget, her parents were just junk traders who sold her off. Rey eventually resists and leaves to rejoin the Resistance while Kylo assumes his role as the new Supreme Leader.As the Resistance fighters are making their way to Crait, Hux's men start to fire upon the transports, killing heavy numbers of the Resistance. Seeing no other option, Holdo sacrifices herself and rams the command ship at light-speed into the First Order ship, splitting it in two and destroying other nearby ships.BB-8, having escaped the villains' clutches, commandeers a AT-AT armored Walker to fire upon the First Order soldiers. Finn and Rose prepare to escape, but Finn battles Phasma until he overpowers her. She tells him he was always scum, to which he proudly responds, ""Rebel scum."" The ship starts to come apart, and Phasma falls into the burning wreckage. Finn and Rose head off to meet the others on Crait.The surviving Resistance fighters have dwindled to a few dozen or so. Kylo and Hux lead gigantic walkers to the Resistance stronghold, armed with a battering ram cannon that will obliterate the entrance. Poe leads Finn, Rose, and a few others on speeders to fight back. Rey and Chewie come down with the Falcon to draw away TIE fighters while Finn attempts to stop the cannon. He nearly flies head on until Rose crashes her ship into his to stop him. Finn goes to her and asks why she did it. She tells him they always fight for what they love. She kisses him and then passes out. Finn rushes back to the stronghold to get Rose medical attention.The First Order fires their cannon onto the stronghold. Poe and Leia appear hopeless with most of their comrades dead and their own doom approaching. Suddenly, Leia is visited by Luke. The two siblings have a final meeting, with Luke saying that ""Nobody is ever truly gone."" Luke goes out to face the First Order. Kylo orders the soldiers to fire everything on Luke where he stands. Even after the insane amount of firepower unleashed on Luke, he still stands and coolly brushes his shoulder off. Poe realizes Luke is distracting the villains to allow them to escape. The fighters follow crystal wolves to an exit, only to be blocked by a huge pile of rocks.Kylo goes down to face Luke himself. They duel with their light-sabers, and Kylo attempts to strike Luke with a killing blow, only to realize Luke is a hologram... projecting himself while still on Ahch-To. Luke tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi. At that moment, Rey uses the Force to clear the way for the fighters. She and Finn embrace. Kylo screams in rage at his defeat as the heroes board the Falcon and escape.On Ahch-To, Luke finishes using what power he had left. He looks up and sees a twin sunset, just like back on Tatooine. He smiles, and then, he vanishes, now completely becoming one with the Force. Rey tells Leia that she has sensed that Luke is now gone, and she asks what will become of the Resistance now. Leia tells her they have what they need to rebuild.On Canto Bight, a trio of stable children that previously encountered Finn and Rose are telling each other the story of Luke Skywalker. Their master comes over to scold them to force them back to work. The boy they had found in the stable goes outside to sweep. He looks up at the sky to see the Falcon flying overhead, and, with Rose's Resistance ring on his finger, he raises his broom like a light-saber.The film closes with the words, ""In loving memory of our princess, Carrie Fisher."""
Beauty and the Beast,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A selfish Prince is cursed to become a monster for the rest of his life, unless he learns to fall in love with a beautiful young woman he keeps prisoner. Disney's animated classic takes on a new form, with a widened mythology and an all-star cast. A young Prince, imprisoned in the form of a Beast (Dan Stevens), can be freed only by true love. What may be his only opportunity arrives when he meets Belle (Emma Watson), the only human girl to ever visit the castle since it was enchanted. As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress. Only condition is if he can learn to love someone and earn their love in return, the curse will be lifted. Enter young bookworm Belle, who stumbles upon the castle and is taken prisoner by the Beast while rescuing her father. With help from the Beast's servants, Belle comes to appreciate and love the Beast all while evading a stalking hunter who wants to marry her.—Blazer346 To pay the dark price of pride for failing to look past one's superficial beauty, a mighty enchantress curses a self-absorbed and cold-hearted French prince to a life of solitude, transforming him into an appalling monster, and the castle's servants into ordinary but sentient household objects. But, as the years pass by in the desolate palace, an inadvertent mistake will condemn the kind and rebellious book-lover, Belle, to imprisonment within the thick-walled fortress, as the enchanted mansion's lord desperately seeks love's warm embrace. The Beast, trembles with fear knowing that his time is short, yet hope still lies in a frail rose's last petal. Will Belle lift in time the veil that shrouds the bewitched aristocrat?—Nick Riganas A young selfish prince has been turned into a Beast by an Enchantress for refusing to give her shelter and his servants have been turned into household objects. In order for the curse to be lifted, the Beast must learn to love and earn that person's love in return before the last petal falls, but if he fails to love someone his curse will be permanent. Belle is a young village book-worm, she has lost her mother when she was a baby and she is living with her widowed father, Maurice. Belle longs for a more better life away from the small village. Matters soon become worse, when Maurice is imprisoned by the Beast for supposedly stealing from him. Belle takes her father's place as the Beast's prisoner. Belle soon learns from the servants about how the Prince was very kind, but after his mother died from an illness, his abusive father raised his son to be selfish. Belle decides to help the servants lift the curse and help the Beast learn to be compassionate towards others. As days begin to pass, Belle starts to fall in love with the Beast, but her love for the prince will ultimately lead her into a conflict with Gaston, an arrogant soldier and hunter, who wants to marry Belle.—dawsonpersi Long ago in a French kingdom, there lived a spoiled and selfish Prince (Dan Stevens) in a castle where he would throw big parties with all his royal subjects. One night, an old beggar (Agatha woman entered his castle and offered the Prince a rose in exchange for shelter from the cold. The Prince sneered and laughed at the old woman along with his subjects, even as she warned him not to be deceived by appearances. The Prince turned her away once more, and soon after, the old woman's haggard appearance disappeared to reveal a beautiful Enchantress. The Prince tried to ask for forgiveness, but the Enchantress had already seen there was no love in his heart. As punishment, she turned the Prince into a hideous Beast and transformed the subjects into household objects. The Enchantress's spell caused the people outside the kingdom to forget about the castle and everyone living in it. The Beast was left with a magic mirror as his window to the outside world, as well as a rose. If the Beast can earn the love of another before the last petal falls, the spell will be broken. Otherwise, he will be doomed to forever remain a beast.Several years later in the village of Villeneuve, there lives a young woman named Belle (Emma Watson). She doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the townspeople, who all view her as odd (""Belle""). Belle's interests lie in storybooks. She is pursued by the handsome but narcissistic hunter/former war captain Gaston (Luke Evans). He rides into town with his lackey, LeFou (Josh Gad), and finds Belle after she leaves a book shop. Gaston attempts to woo her and invite himself to dinner with her, but she turns him down.Belle returns home to her father Maurice (Kevin Kline), a music box maker. He is in the process of creating a music box modeled after himself and his late wife, who was also Belle's mother (""How Does A Moment Last Forever""). Belle tells Maurice how she notices that the villagers think she's odd, which Maurice rejects. Maurice is set to head to another town to sell his music boxes, and Belle asks him to bring back a rose, like he always does.Maurice rides through the forest with his horse Philippe. He turns toward a path where snow is falling. A pack of wolves encounters Maurice, forcing him and Philippe to flee. They pass through a gate that leads him onto the forgotten grounds of the Prince's castle. Maurice enters the castle and is spotted by Lumiere the candelabra (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian Mckellen) the mantel clock. Maurice walks into the dining hall and sits down. He is startled when Chip (Nathan Mack), a young boy turned into a teacup, moves toward him and speaks to him. Maurice runs out of the castle and starts to ride away until he passes through the garden and spots a rose. He tries to pick one for Belle, but he is found by the Beast, who calls Maurice a thief. The Beast takes him prisoner.Back in the village, Belle is trying to show a little girl how to read until she is called out by a man who discourages her from teaching another girl to read. Gaston finds Belle and once again tries to court her after saying she shouldn't concern herself with any children other than hers. Belle knows what he is trying to say, and she firmly tells him that she will never marry him. After scoffing at the idea of being Gaston's wife, she expresses her desire to seek adventure and excitement away from the village (""Belle Reprise""). Moments later, Philippe returns and Belle knows that something bad must have happened to Maurice.Belle rides Philippe back to the castle. She finds Maurice in the dungeon, where warns her to turn back. Belle then meets the Beast and is stunned by his appearance. The Beast says Maurice is a thief and must serve for life in the dungeon. Belle offers to take his place, despite Maurice's objections. The Beast agrees to the exchange and he lets Maurice go. Belle promises him she will find a way out of there.Belle meets Lumiere and Cogsworth, despite initially being freaked out by them. Lumiere was actually the castle footman and Cogsworth was the castle majordomo before the curse transformed them both into a candelabra and a mantel clock. Belle also meets Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), Chip's mother and kitchen stewardess who is now a teapot, plus Chip himself; Plumette (Gugu Mcbatha-raw), the maid and Lumiere's girlfriend turned into a featherduster resembling a peacock; Madame DE Garderobe (Audra Mcdowell), an Italian opera singer who is now a wardrobe; and Maestro Cadenza (Stanley Tucci), Garderobe's husband and head musician who is now a harpsichord. Lumiere guides Belle out of the dungeon and into a room in the East Wing. Garderobe dresses Belle in a ghastly frock, which gives Belle the idea to use the ribbons to climb down the tower.Gaston is in a tavern with LeFou lamenting Belle's rejection of him. LeFou tries to cheer him up along with the other villagers by talking (or rather, singing) in detail about how great Gaston is (""Gaston""). Not long after, Maurice enters and starts raving about the Beast and how he's taken Belle as his prisoner. The other villagers laugh at his claims, but Gaston offers to follow Maurice to find the Beast, mainly to get Belle to marry him.The Beast tries to get Belle to join him for dinner, but he is too abrasive as he pounds on her bedroom door. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Plumette all stand behind him and try to help, but Belle refuses to join the Beast as she is still tying ribbons together to make her rope. The Beast storms off and insults his servants. We see the rose drops another petal, and as a result, the castle starts to shake and crumble a little. It also causes the castle objects to become less and less human.Belle leaves her room and joins the castle objects as they guide her to the dining hall. Lumiere leads the objects in a dazzling musical number (""Be Our Guest"") as they boast about their fine dining. Afterwards, Belle wanders into the West Wing, which Lumiere and Cogsworth had tried (poorly) to keep a secret from her. There, Belle finds the rose encased in a jar. The Beast then frightens her and screams at her to get out. Belle runs away and rides Philippe out of the castle grounds. The wolves then attack her in the forest. Belle tries to fight them off until the Beast shows up and fights them himself. The alpha wolf bites into his back, but the Beast throws it off and roars, scaring the wolves away he is injured badly and collapses. Belle then helps the Beast onto Philippe.Belle nurses the beast's wound, even as he complains about the pain a spark of friendship devolpes between them. She lets him rest. Mrs. Potts explains to Belle that the Beast was not always so unkind. Since they have known him all his life, they know that after the Prince's mother died, his father raised him to be the way he was before he was cursed. When Belle asks about the rose, the objects say that the Prince will remain a beast forever if the last petal falls without him finding someone to love and to love him back, and that they will become inanimate. They sing about their yearning to become human again (""Days in the Sun""), and we see the young Prince looking upon his mother on her deathbed before his father pulls him away.Maurice leads Gaston and LeFou into the forest as they try to find the path to the castle. Gaston and LeFou think Maurice is just crazy. Once Gaston reveals his true intention to only be helping Maurice for Belle's hand, he also growls at Maurice and threatens to leave him to the wolves. Gaston tries to cover it up by putting on the nice guy act, but Maurice already sees who Gaston really is and makes it clear that he will never allow Gaston to marry Belle. Gaston knocks Maurice out cold and ties him to a tree so the wolves can come after him. LeFou considers this to be too much, but he has no choice and must follow Gaston.Belle is reading Shakespeare to the Beast, who already knows the story by heart. He then brings Belle to see his enormous library, which he says can be hers now. Over time, Belle warms up to the Beast as he shows his kinder and more gentle side, and the objects can see it too (""Something There""). The Beast later shows Belle an enchanted book that allows anyone to travel anywhere they want to go if they can visualize it. Belle places her hand in the book and they are transported to an old house in Paris. It was once home to Maurice and his wife when Belle was a baby. The Beast finds a doctor's mask, indicating that Belle's mother was killed by the plague. A flashback shows Maurice (Joylon Coy) tending to his wife as she is dying. She tells him to protect Belle (Daisy Mczual), and all that was left behind was a glass rose, which Belle finds. (""How Does a Moment Last Forever? (Montmatre""))Maurice is saved by a local beggar woman named Agathe, who tends to him. Maurice returns to Villeneuve and is sitting in the tavern when Gaston and LeFou return to find him, both surprised. Maurice tells the villagers that Gaston left him to die in the forest. When Maurice calls out LeFou as a witness, Gaston intimidates LeFou into lying to cover his back. Gaston has Maurice dismissed as a delusional madman.The Beast invites Belle to dance with him in the ballroom. Garderobe dresses Belle in a beautiful gown while Lumiere and the others try to properly groom the Beast. The two then meet in the staircase and walk into the ballroom as Cadenza plays a tune to accompany them (""Beauty and the Beast""). Belle and the Beast share a romantic dance. Afterwards, the Beast wonders to Belle if she may be happy there, but she asks if anyone can be happy if they are not free. He knows she misses her father, and he gives her the magic mirror to see him. Belle sees the villagers harassing Maurice, and she knows he is in trouble. The Beast sets Belle free so that she may go to help Maurice. The Beast climbs his tower in despair as Belle rides away, though he knows now that he truly does love her (""Evermore""). The castle objects become sad since they know Belle doesn't love him in return for the curse to be broken.Gaston has Maurice committed to a mental institution, managed by Monsieur D'Arque, but gives him one more chance to redeem himself if he gives Gaston his blessing to marry Belle. Maurice still refuses, so Gaston sends him away. Belle arrives in the nick of time to stop the carriage from riding off. She shows the villagers the mirror to prove the Beast exists, which horrifies everyone. Gaston changes his tune and starts to gather the villagers to go after the Beast before he attempts to harm anyone else (""Mob Song""). Belle is then locked in the carriage with Maurice as Gaston leads to villagers to storm the castle.The castle objects see the villagers making their way to the castle. They try to hold the door closed, but the villagers start to break it down. Cogsworth goes to warn the Beast, who is too depressed to care about what happens. Lumiere then leads all the castle objects into a plan. As the villagers enter, LeFou sees Mrs. Potts and Chip, mistakenly assuming Mrs. Potts is his grandmother. She is NOT happy and she initiates the fight. Lumiere lights up the floor, Mrs. Potts pours hot tea on the attackers, Cadenza shoots his piano keys, Cogsworth sends flying books to hit the villagers, and Garderobe dresses Three French Stooges in powdered wigs, make-up, and gowns. Two stooges run away in horror, but the third stooge is rather pleased with his look. Cadenza sits on LeFou, who asks Gaston for help. He refuses so that he can go after the Beast. Moments later, Mrs. Potts falls from the chandelier, but LeFou catches her and decides to switch sides. Mrs. Potts tells him he's too good for Gaston anyway. Meanwhile, Agathe is seen going up the stairs. The villagers then run away in terror.In the carriage, Belle reveals the glass rose to Maurice and that she knows the truth about what happened to her mother. Maurice insists he only wanted to protect her, which Belle understands. She takes out a pin so that Maurice can pick the lock. They break out of the carriage, and Belle rides Philippe back to the castle.Gaston makes his way up to the tower and finds the Beast sitting sadly outside the window. He claims Belle sent him and then shoots the Beast in the back and causes him to fall onto a lower roof. Gaston goes after him and wants the Beast to fight back. Belle then returns to the castle, which reinvigorates the Beast's spirit. He defends himself against Gaston and declares he is not a beast. He holds Gaston over a ledge as the coward begs for mercy, but spares his life and orders him to leave. The Beast leaps to the next tower to be with Belle, only for Gaston to shoot him twice in the back moments later. Karma then goes for Gaston as the bridge he is standing on crumbles, and he falls to his death.The Beast is mortally wounded, but has enough time to see Belle before he dies. The last petal then falls. The castle objects celebrate their victory over the villagers, but Plumette turns into an ordinary featherduster in Lumiere's arms. Mrs. Potts frantically looks for Chip as she becomes a regular teapot. Chip arrives soon after and almost crashes but is caught by the coat hanger, and they both become inanimate along with the wardrobe and her husband and pet dog. Lumiere and Cogsworth express their mutual friendship before they too become inanimate.Belle cries over the Beast and tells him she loves him. Agathe enters the room as Belle says this. It turns out Agathe was the Enchantress in disguise, and she restores the rose to its original look, thus breaking the spell. The Beast then transforms back into his human self. He and Belle then share their first kiss. The darkness then disappears over the kingdom, and everything starts going back to normal. Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Plumette, Cadenza, and Garderobe all wake up and turn human again and reunite with their loved ones. Mrs. Potts reunites with her husband from the village, while Cogsworth reunites with his wife (though he's not too thrilled about that). The Prince runs to hug his friends.A celebration is held in the ballroom with all the castle subjects and villagers, including Maurice and LeFou, joining. Belle and the Prince share a dance, wherein Belle asks the Prince if he can grow a beard. Garderobe and Mrs. Potts sing while Cadenza plays the music over the dance. And they all lived happily ever after. (""Finale"")"

As she reaches adulthood, Diana continues training to be as fierce as the other Amazons. During one session, Antiope pushes Diana hard with her swordplay, leading Diana to defend herself by deflecting the sword with her gauntlets. This causes Antiope to fly back and hurt herself. Diana shows great remorse for hurting Antiope. She leaves in shame, but Antiope is far from upset.Diana runs over to a cliff. In the distance, a plane passes through the barrier into Themyscira before crashing into the ocean. Diana dives into the water and swims toward the plane. A pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is sinking as he cannot break himself free from his seat. Diana pulls him out of the plane and takes him to shore. As she becomes surprised to see a man for the first time, German soldiers following Steve make it past the barrier as well. The Amazons arrive as they find Diana with Steve, but also see the Germans. The Amazons ready their arrows, and the Germans aim their rifles. The arrows are launched and shots are fired. The Germans make it to the shore and battle the Amazons. Several Amazons are shot dead while the Germans get taken out easily. Antiope fires three arrows at once to kill three soldiers. One soldier aims his gun at Diana, and Antiope leaps in to take the shot. Diana rushes to Antiope's side. As she dies, she tells Diana it is her time to wield the God Killer.Steve is interrogated before all the Amazons with the Lasso of Truth. He is forced to confess that he is a spy with the Allied forces. Steve explains to the Amazons about World War I and how he has learned of a sinister plan by Germany's General Erich Ludendorff (Chris Pine) and his chief chemist Dr. Isabel Maru, AKA Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya). They are concocting a new bio-weapon, which Steve claims is unlike anything he's seen before and tells the Amazons they are in more danger than they realize. Steve acted as a spy in the German army before stealing Maru's notebook and flying away with it as he destroyed the Germans' other planes until they followed him to the island. Diana realizes this must be the work of Ares.Steve is allowed to bathe in the Amazons' fountain to replenish himself. Diana walks in and accidentally sees him nude. She asks what ""that"" is, and Steve says it is his father's watch, which he says he follows to let him know what to do in the day. Diana is confused by the device and its uses.Still fearing that Ares is behind the ongoing war, Diana grabs her shield, and lasso, and then takes the God Killer sword from its holding, along with her battle suit. She goes to tell Steve she will help him get home if he takes her to Ares. The two head for the shore but are approached by Hippolyta and other Amazons. Diana is insistent that she goes out there to stop Ares and end the war. Hippolyta tearfully embraces her daughter one last time and tells her she has always been her greatest love, but today she is her greatest sorrow. She gives Diana Antiope's tiara as a parting gift, but warns her that if she leaves she may not be able to return to Themyscira. As Diana and Steve depart, Hippolyta confides to an Amazon that Diana can't know what she really is, or else Ares will find her faster.Diana and Steve arrive in London. The two meet with Steve's secretary, Etta Candy (Lucy Davis). Before they can deliver Maru's notebook to Steve's superiors, they find Diana an appropriate outfit to wear so she can blend in for the time. Diana and Steve are then cornered by some men in an alley. They draw their guns, but Diana beats them all down, even letting Steve punch the last guy out.Ludendorff meets with Maru in her lab. She has developed a new type of gas for the general so that he may maintain his super strength. Maru then comes across a formula on her table, which she thinks is the breakthrough they've been looking for.Diana and Steve head on over to a meeting held by Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), who is planning to negotiate an armistice with Germany. The men in the room are immediately distracted by Diana's presence. Steve is forced to take her outside. Later, he presents Sir Patrick with the notebook. Since the writing is in Sumerian, Steve has Diana (who speaks hundreds of languages) translate it for the other men. They learn that Ludendorff and Maru are planning to create a new kind of hydrogen-based mustard gas that would be far more lethal to the soldiers. After hearing that the British general is planning to send his troops to the Western Front and go in to most likely get killed, Diana becomes enraged and tells the general that a good leader would fight alongside his men. Steve pulls Diana out again as she tells him that she believes Ludendorff is Ares in disguise. Steve confides to Diana that he will personally take her to the Front.Steve brings Diana to meet his teammates. They first stop at a pub and find Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), a spy who is instantly attracted to Diana. Next is Charlie (Ewen Bremner), whom Steve says is a skilled marksman, but they find him getting beaten up by another man for accidentally taking his glass. The man attempts to shoot Charlie, but Diana intervenes and knocks the man down. The four then head out to meet The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock), a smuggler.Ludendorff meets with some of his comrades to discuss what he has planned. After they express some doubts and lack of confidence in his work, Ludendorff and Maru demonstrate their work by throwing the gas bomb in the room, killing all the men.The team makes it to the Front. They walk through the trenches, and Diana speaks to a local woman who is distraught over what has been taken from them by the German army. Not wanting to wait any longer, Diana dons her tiara and steps out into the battlefield with her armor. The German soldiers begin to fire upon her, but she easily deflects their bullets with her gauntlets. Diana proceeds to beat down the enemy soldiers while Steve and his team follow. Once she takes out most of the soldiers on the ground, the men help Diana leap to a sniper tower, which she instantly demolishes. The townspeople celebrate and cheer for Diana.Steve later learns that Ludendorff will be attending a gala the next day. He has Etta locate the area for him, but Sir Patrick urges Steve not to go ahead and do it. Steve naturally ignores him. He then tells Diana about the gala and how she would be unprepared for it, so he shows her how to dance. They go up to a room to be alone, and they share a kiss.The team heads over to the gala in disguise. Steve pretends to be a German officer with Sameer being his driver as they improvise entering without an invitation. Diana finds a snooty woman and steals her dress. Steve attempts to sweet-talk Maru to get more information, but he becomes distracted when he sees Diana enter in the blue dress. Diana sees Ludendorff and gets ready to kill him, but Steve stops her from messing up the plan. However, Ludendorff proceeds to launch gas bombs into the nearby town. Diana runs ahead but is too late. She sees the townspeople dead in the streets and can only look on with despair. Steve runs by and Diana is angry with him for not letting her kill Ludendorff before this happened.It is learned that Ludendorff plans to use a plane to drop a number of gas bombs down on London. Diana rushes to an airbase where the German soldiers are gearing up for their attack. Diana beats down some soldiers before making her way to Ludendorff. He inhales Maru's strength gas and fights Diana. Ludendorff puts up a good fight until he runs to the roof. Diana bursts through and impales Ludendorff with the God Killer. He dies but Diana sees that the soldiers are still pushing the gas bombs into the plane.Steve shows up and Diana is confused as to why the war isn't over if she killed Ares. Steve says that maybe the war isn't a result of a god but rather that there are just bad people out there. He leaves, and Diana looks back inside Ludendorff's office to see Sir Patrick. Diana realizes it is him that is really Ares. He tells Diana how he only provided secret influence to people like Ludendorff and Maru to get their work going, but it was their own evil, as well as the darkness of other men, that led to the war. Diana tries to kill Ares with the sword, only for him to destroy it. He tells Diana that it is she who is the real weapon forged by Zeus. She is the real God Killer. Using the Lasso, Ares shows Diana what can happen if she joins him and if they rid the world of mankind. She refuses, and they begin to fight.Steve and his team get past the Germans. They consider shooting the plane down, but the explosion would kill anyone within 50 Miles. As Diana and Ares' fight extends onto the tarmac, Steve runs by Diana, says something quick, and he gives her his father's watch. He hijacks the bomber plane and flies it away. As he gets high enough, Steve aims his gun at the bombs. He takes a moment to consider what he's doing, but he knows what he has to do. He shoots the bombs, sacrificing himself as the plane blows up. Diana sees this and yells in agony. Ares only uses this to try and sway her even more to join him as he dons his armor. Ares brings Maru before Diana and removes Maru's mask to reveal her disfigured face. He tries to convince Diana to kill her. Diana lifts up a tank, but she recalls what Steve just told her. He said he can save the day, but she can save the world. He told her he loved her before taking the plane. Diana drops the tank and lets Maru get away. Diana tells Ares that she believes in love. Ares fires a blast of energy at Diana, but she absorbs it with her gauntlets and directs it back toward Ares, destroying him for good. The soldiers are then broken free of their corruption.Everyone celebrates the end of the war. Diana sees a wall of the fallen heroes, including Steve.Back in the present, Diana sends a message to Bruce Wayne, thanking him for the photograph and letting her keep a piece of Steve. Her voice-over then reassures that she will continue dedicating her life to justice. With that, Diana leaps across the sky to continue her work as...WONDER WOMAN."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283362/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four teenagers are sucked into a magical video game, and the only way they can escape is to work together to finish the game. In a brand-new Jumanji adventure, four high-school kids discover an old video-game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji--you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they must go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves --or they'll be stuck in the game forever, to be played by others without break.—Sony Pictures Jumanji, the magical board game and ancient portal to its fearsome and savage jungles, gets an upgrade, this time luring four teens into its realm when one of them stumbles upon an old-school video-game console. Inevitably, as the unwitting players transform into their chosen game avatars inside a mysterious new world crawling with formidable adversaries, they'll need to put their newly-acquired skills to good use to finally complete the game. The deep sound of the feral drums is incessant. Can the quirky quartet return to the physical world in one piece?—Nick Riganas When 4 high schoolers are sucked into the video game, jumanji, they soon find out that they each have special capabilities. They must use these capabilities to complete the challenges to escape jumanji, with a certain amount of lives and new bodies to handle, will these four teens band together to escape? Or will they be stuck in jumanji, forever!—Ethan Bates Four teens are transported into the video game Jumanji. They now have new bodies, complete with unique strengths and weaknesses. They also have a mission: retrieve a precious gem from an evil warlord and return it to the statue from which it came. If they can't do this, they'll never leave the game.—grantss In 1996, teenager Alex Vreeke (Mason Guccione) receives the original (and cursed) Jumanji board game after his father finds it while jogging on a beach, but puts it aside, dismissively noting that nobody plays board games anymore, instead playing a video game involving motorcycles. Overnight, the game changes so that the box's contents are now a video game cartridge, but when Alex puts it in his console and turns it on, he vanishes.Twenty years later, high school student Spencer Gilpin (Alex Wolff) is sent to detention for helping his former best friend, Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (Ser'Darius Blain), with his homework by writing Fridge's essays for him. They are joined by Bethany Walker (Madison Iseman), a beautiful girl who was caught talking on her phone during a quiz, and Martha Kaply (Morgan Turner), a socially awkward girl who objected to being made to participate in gym class. For detention, they are charged by Principal Bentley (Marc Evan Jackson) with removing the staples from discarded magazines in an old storage area, but Spencer discovers the console containing the Jumanji game and convinces the others to play it with him. They are unable to access one of the five-player options, a pilot, but once all four others have been selected, the game draws them all inside it.Finding themselves in a jungle, all four are shaken to realize that they have become the avatars they chose for the game. Spencer finds himself turned into Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), a muscular archaeologist. Fridge arrives into the game as Franklin ""Moose"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), an expert zoologist, but Fridge is upset that his avatar is a foot shorter than he normally is. Martha becomes Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), ""killer of men"". Bethany is now Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black), a cartographer that Bethany mistook for a woman because the description read ""curvy genius"" (and she becomes horrified upon seeing her reflection). The four freak out as they realize they are in the game. Almost immediately, Bethany is suddenly eaten by a hippopotamus that emerges from the river, but she swiftly reappears after falling out of the sky.Fleeing from a stampede of hippos, the group encounter Nigel (Rhys Darby), whose repetitive responses help Spencer identify him as an NPC (non-player character) who tells them that they have come to Jumanji (in the context of the game) in response to a letter Nigel wrote to Spencer's avatar. The letter explains that Nigel was part of an expedition by explorer John Hardin Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale) to claim the legendary gem, the ""Jaguar's Eye"", removal of the gem from the large jaguar statue granting Van Pelt control over the animals of Jumanji. In order to complete the game, the players must return the gem to the jaguar statue and call out ""Jumanji"".With those instructions given, the group are dropped off outside a forest, where it is revealed that Bethany alone can read the map Nigel gave them, the map directing them to the next stage of their quest. They are subsequently attacked by Van Pelt's men on motorbikes, but manage to escape by fleeing through the trees and jumping off a cliff into a river. After emerging from the river, Martha realizes that she has been shot, but returns to the group immediately after her avatar explodes. Examining a series of line tattoos on their forearms, which originally consisted of three bars where Martha and Bethany now only have two, Spencer realizes that these bars indicate the number of lives they have in the game, guessing that they will die for good, both in the game, and in the real world as well, once they lose all three lives.While traveling to the bazaar where they will receive their next clue, an argument between Spencer and Fridge over Fridge's perception of Spencer's role in this problem results in Fridge pushing Spencer off a cliff, costing him one of his lives. In the bazaar, Fridge loses one of his lives when he eats cake - previously identified as one of his character's weaknesses - and explodes, drawing the attention of Van Pelt's minions. Fortunately, before they are attacked, they discover their next clue hidden in a basket containing a snake, which the team are able to acquire by pooling their skills and coming together, allowing Spencer to catch the snake while Fridge defangs it. When Van Pelt's forces attack, Spencer attempts to fight them off, but they are soon confronted by Van Pelt himself, only just escaping when another player uses a smoke grenade as a distraction and leads them to a secret passage.The fifth playable character introduces himself as the pilot Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough (Nick Jonas), who says his real name is Alex. He leads the gang away. Alex takes the four to a tree-house that once belonged to Alan Parrish (Robin Williams's character from the original movie). He makes margaritas for the gang, and Fridge gets drunk. Alex mentions that he has been stuck in the game for months, and he hasn't been able to get to the transportation shed to get himself out. Alex has used up two of his lives and been unable to progress further without the others due to his limited skills, but has identified the transport shed where they will acquire the means to move on. While Bethany teaches Martha in how to flirt to distract the guards, Alex's dated references lead Spencer and Fridge to realize that he is Alex Vreeke, Alex in turn, being shocked to learn that he has been trapped in the game for over twenty years. Although Alex suffers a panic attack, the team are able to gain access to the transport shed after Martha taps into her character's strength of dance combat, subsequently helping Alex recognize that they can complete the game by working together.There is a brief panic when damage to the helicopter traps it in a canyon in front of a rampaging herd of white rhinoceros, but Spencer is able to repair the damage and help them ascend. Unfortunately, they lose the gem when it falls out of Fridge's backpack, but Spencer is able to reclaim the gem after using Fridge as a 'sacrifice' to draw the rhino herd's attention, subsequently ordering Alex to spin the helicopter in time to catch Fridge as he 'respawns'. Once they land, Alex is stung by a mosquito and begins to die due to his avatar's weakness, but Bethany saves him by giving him CPR, which passes one of her remaining lives to him. As they prepare for their next step, Spencer and Martha admit that they have feelings for each other in the real world, while Bethany begins to bond with Alex.Making their way to the jaguar statue, they find themselves confronted by actual jaguar guards, which cost Spencer one of his lives when he attempts to take the gem along the path to the statue alone. With Fridge's support, Spencer implements a plan where Martha takes out Van Pelt's approaching minions while the other three provide a distraction for the jaguars, leaving Spencer to take one of the minion's motorbikes and continue to the statue. Van Pelt attempts to gain the advantage by taking Bethany hostage, but Fridge is able to drive the jaguar guards away by befriending an elephant, only for the players to lose the gem when it is thrown away. While the others distract Van Pelt's minions, Spencer takes the bike to the top of the statue while Martha retrieves the gem from a pit full of snakes, using her character's weakness to venom to sacrifice her second life and 'respawn' in a position where she can pass the gem to Spencer as she falls. With this action, Spencer places the gem in the statue and calls out ""Jumanji!"", ending the game and restoring the jungle to peace. With this victory, Nigel appears to congratulate the group, shaking their hands and returning them to the real world.Back in the storage room, all four detention students have returned to their true forms, but are saddened to find that Alex is not among them. As they walk home, they witness the Vreeke household - which had fallen into disrepair as Alex's parents had no answer as to his fate - has been fully restored. As a car parks outside the house to release a family, the father sees the former players and confirms that he is Alex, who emerged from the game in 1996 and changed his history, also revealing that he named his eldest daughter after Bethany.The following week at school, Spencer and Fridge are friends once again, and Bethany is making plans to go backpacking, while Spencer and Martha start dating. When they hear the drumbeats of Jumanji, they take the console out to the back of the school and Fridge drops a bowling ball onto it, each intending that this will end the game once and for all.However, at the end of the end credits, Jumanji's menacing jungle drums play once again, suggesting the game still exists in some form to play another of its dangerous games."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Guardians struggle to keep together as a team while dealing with their personal family issues, notably Star-Lord's encounter with his father, the ambitious celestial being Ego.

And having failed to protect the Anulax Batteries, the most potent source of energy in the entire universe, the Guardians have made a new enemy: Ayesha, the Golden High Priestess of the technologically advanced, genetically engineered extragalactic race known as The Sovereign. To top it all, the team has a chance encounter with a mysterious being named Ego and a hard-as-nails character from the past. With their lives hanging by a thread, can the Guardians of the Galaxy save the world for the second time?—Nick Riganas After saving Xandar from Ronan the Accuser, the Guardians of the Galaxy have been widely recognized as heroes and they have been on a series of heroic missions to protect the galaxy from dangerous threats. Peter's leadership is soon put to the test, when he learns his biological father is Ego and he starts to develop romantic feelings for Gamora. Determined to learn more about his past, Peter decides to go with Gamora and Drax to visit Ego on his planet. Rocket and Groot stay behind to guard Nebula, so he can repair the damage on the ship after crash landing on a planet to avoid Ayesha and her army. During Peter's visit on his father's planet, he begins to learn that not everything is what it seems and some horrifying truths soon come to light for Peter and his friends. The heroes will start to face an even more dangerous threat than they are expecting.—dawsonpersi Missouri, Planet Earth, 1980Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock) is riding in a car, listening to tunes on the radio with her boyfriend (Kurt Russell), whom she calls her ""spaceman"". They go behind a Dairy Queen and run into the woods where the man shows Meredith a small alien seedling, which he says will eventually be all over the place. He then kisses Meredith.34 years later.The Guardians of the Galaxy, Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are standing on a platform as they try to secure Anulax Batteries from their latest employers, the Sovereigns. The Guardians have their weapons ready as they gear up to battle an inter-dimensional beast known as the Abilisk. The Abilisk descends, leading the Guardians to spring into action, except for Groot, who is jamming out to ""Mr. Blue Sky"" on a speaker that Rocket set up, all while the others are trying to annihilate the Abilisk. Drax ends up falling on the speaker, to Groot's dismay. Since they cannot harm the Abilisk from the outside, Drax tries to kill it from inside by allowing it to swallow him. Star-Lord notices a cut on the monster's neck and orders Rocket to get it to look up. Gamora then slices the Abilisk downward, killing it and letting Drax spill out of the hole.The Guardians bring the batteries back to the Sovereigns and meet with their High Priestess, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). In exchange for the batteries, the Sovereigns deliver Gamora's sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) to the Guardians so that they can take her to Xandar and collect the bounty for her. Before they leave, Ayesha talks down to the Guardians, but Peter in particular, noting his half-human/half-alien heritage gives him something she deems reckless. The Guardians leave, with Rocket swiping some of the batteries for himself.On their way to the planet Xandar, the Guardians are suddenly met by a fleet of Sovereign drones, all going after them for the stolen batteries. The others figure it was Rocket that took them, and they're all pissed off. The drones start attacking as Rocket tries to steer the Milano toward a wormhole that will lead them to another planet. In the distance, another craft passes by and starts to destroy the Sovereign drones. A man appears to stand on his ship and wave to the Guardians. The Guardians escape the drones but must crash-land on a nearby planet.As the Guardians observe the wreckage of their ship, the other ship that saved them descends. Stepping out is Ego, who reveals himself to be Peter's father. With him is his empathic assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff).On another planet, Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his team of Ravagers have fallen on hard times. He is staying in a nearby hotel (where Howard The Duck is also in attendance). Yondu spots his old comrade Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), who has exiled Yondu from the Ravager team for child trafficking. Among the Ravagers is Taserface (Chris Sullivan), who thinks the Ravagers need a new leader, along with Kraglin (Sean Gunn), who has since also come to question Yondu's leadership. After Yondu finishes talking to Stakar, the Sovereigns arrive, and Ayesha approaches Yondu with a proposition.Peter is still in shock to finally be meeting his father. Ego explains that he sent Yondu to pick Peter up after his mother died. Peter still also doesn't understand why Ego left Meredith in the first place. He invites Peter and his friends to his planet, which Peter is hesitant about until Gamora convinces him to join his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax go with Ego and Mantis while Rocket and Groot stay behind to fix the Milano and keep an eye on Nebula.On Ego's ship, the three talk to Mantis, who shows off her powers by seeing into their minds. She lets everyone know that Peter has sexual feelings for Gamora, which Drax finds hilarious.The Ravagers come across the woods where the Guardians crash-landed. Most of them end up walking into traps laid out by Rocket until Yondu shows up with his Yaka Arrow controlled through his whistling. The Ravagers get Rocket and Groot, but when Taserface plans to get Peter, Yondu isn't quite as willing to turn him over. Nebula then breaks the crest on Yondu's head to knock him out. She aligns herself with the Ravagers as they take Rocket, Groot, and Yondu prisoner.Ego brings everyone to the planet that literally lives through him, as Ego is a Celestial and his consciousness is the core of the planet. He explains to the three that he came up with a human form to travel the galaxy and he came to Earth and fell in love with Meredith, but could not see her so often because it would take up a lot of his energy. Peter continues to hold hostile feelings for Ego for leaving Meredith alone to die. As Peter grows more emotional, his hands produce powerful energy that is linked to Ego's own power. Ego shows him how to control and use it.On the Ravager ship, Taserface and his goons start ejecting those that are still loyal to Yondu, except for Kraglin, who only watches in disbelief as his friends are killed. When Taserface boasts of his greatness and ""fearful"" name, Rocket only mocks him. Nebula enters and suggests that the Ravagers turn in their captives to the Kree for the bounties on their heads. She also makes other demands, including a new hand. Kraglin brings her to a ship that she uses to get off the Ravager ship and to go find Gamora.Mantis and Drax form a bond, though Drax continues to remind Mantis that he finds her hideous, but that it is a good thing because he thinks he is hideous as well and still managed to find someone else that loved him for who he is. Mantis says that she needs to tell Drax something important, but Gamora interrupts things and Mantis keeps quiet, instead just taking the two to their rooms.The Ravagers throw Rocket and Yondu in a cell while they take Groot for their own entertainment. Yondu mentions how he was Kree battle slave before Stakar pulled him out and made him a Ravager. When Rocket asks about why Yondu kept Peter around, he insists it's because Peter was small enough to fit in spaces where the others couldn't. The two then resolve to work together to break out of there. They get Groot to come by, and Yondu tells him to get a prototype fin for his head. After bringing a bunch of wrong items, Yondu gets his fin and gets himself and Rocket out. Yondu sends the arrow through every mutinous Ravager they come across, which Rocket and Groot get in on some Ravager ass-kicking themselves. The three board an escape ship with Kraglin, but not before Yondu sets the whole ship to blow up. Taserface gets hit with flames, but he manages to notify Ayesha to Yondu's whereabouts before he goes down with the ship. The other four must go through 700 jumps to get to Ego's planet.Back on Ego's planet, Peter tries to woo Gamora with his dance moves, but it doesn't quite work as she cannot bring herself to express her own attraction to him. After she leaves, Gamora then sees Nebula coming down on her ship, shooting at Gamora. As Nebula crash-lands, she jumps out to start fighting Gamora. Nebula manages to overpower Gamora but reveals that she never wanted to prove she was better than her, just that she wanted to have a real sister. Gamora's success as a warrior led to their father Thanos mutilating Nebula, leading to her resentment of Gamora. The two then form a sort-of alliance as they come across a cavern filled with about a hundred skeletons.Peter and Ego continue to bond. Ego tells Peter that as long as there is light in the planet, Peter will retain his powers, as well as immortality. Mantis sees that Ego has Peter wrapped around his finger now that he knows about his own powers. She rushes to wake up Drax to warn him that Ego's true intentions are now clear.Rocket, Groot, Yondu, and Kraglin make it to their destination. Rocket starts to gloat that he wants to save Peter just to prove he's better than him and can hang it over his head, but Yondu shuts Rocket up by stating how scared Rocket really is and how he puts on the tough guy thing as a facade. They then set off to take on Ego.Ego explains to Peter that he wants to make what he calls ""The Expansion"". He went around the galaxy to thousands of other worlds to plant the seedlings to grow his power over the galaxy and cover the planets in an extension of himself. He impregnated women from those worlds and produced many children that Yondu delivered to him, but when they did not possess the same power of a Celestial, Ego had them killed, and now their bones are what Gamora and Nebula found. Peter just so happens to hold the power that Ego was looking for. Ego also reveals that he put the tumor that killed Meredith in her head so that he would not feel the pain of being apart from her. Peter snaps out of it and begins to unload his guns on Ego in fury. In response, Ego takes Peter and controls him to start spreading the seedlings across the planets, causing mass destruction. To top it off, Ego crushes Peter's Walkman and Awesome Mix Volume 2 that his mother left him.Rocket, Groot, and Yondu meet up with Gamora, Drax, Nebula, and Mantis as they gear up to stop Ego. Unfortunately, they are also met by a fleet of Sovereigns out to kill them as well. Peter fights Ego's human form, but his entire planet self fights back. Mantis is able to put Ego to sleep while the Guardians take care of the others. They fight back against the Sovereigns and eventually destroy their whole fleet with a bunch of lasers. Meanwhile, Rocket builds a bomb using the batteries he stole, which Groot takes and runs off with, despite Rocket warning him not to push the wrong button or else they'll all die. Mantis gets knocked out by a fireball, breaking her hold on Ego and reawakening him. As the others try to get safe, Ego begins to consume them. Peter continues fighting his father using his Celestial powers. Now freed, Groot then finds Ego's brain in the planet's core, and he sets the bomb to go off in five minutes.Drax carries Mantis to the ship while Gamora and Nebula make it back. Rocket gives his last spacesuit to Yondu, knowing he cannot save both him and Peter. Gamora tries to go back, but Rocket stops her so he doesn't lose another friend. Ego pleads with Peter to stop the bomb, or else Peter will just be a normal human. Peter sees nothing wrong with that and lets the bomb go off. Ego's human form disintegrates as the rest of the planet starts to explode. Yondu flies by and grabs Peter. As they leave the planet's atmosphere, Yondu puts the suit on Peter to save him. He tells Peter that while Ego was his father, he was never his daddy. Yondu then starts to freeze up in space, and Peter sadly watches him die.The Guardians prepare to give Yondu a proper Ravager funeral. Kraglin gives Peter a Zune to make up for his lost Walkman, which Yondu had been meaning to give him for a while. In return, Peter gives Kraglin Yondu's arrow, feeling that Yondu would have wanted him to take it. Nebula sets off to hunt Thanos down herself, but not before reconciling with Gamora.

Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May, under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark. Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine--distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man--but when the Vulture emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened.—Flick Direct Peter Parker, The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, is patiently waiting for Tony Stark to give him a mission where he can help out as best as he can manage. Balancing everyday life as Peter Parker alongside being Spider-Man is a daunting task for The Wall Crawler and it starts taking its toll when Parker encounters a gang of underground thugs selling Chitauri-based weapons for a mysterious villain known as The Vulture.—Johnny In the aftermath ofCaptain America: Civil War (2016), Peter Parker, a 15-year-old sophomore and Tony Stark's protégé, finds himself back in Queens, New York trying to juggle high school and his superhero alter-ego. As Peter is on pins and needles waiting for his mentor to give him a chance to prove his mettle and become an official Avenger, Stark chooses to keep Peter on a short leash instead, fearful that the boy might bite off more than he can chew. And then, the Vulture, a winged super-criminal brandishing advanced Chitauri weaponry, emerges. Of course, Parker sees his arrival as a golden opportunity to demonstrate that he has what it takes to be part of the Earth's mightiest team of superheroes. But is Spider-Man ready to be more than the neighborhood's friendly, web-slinging defender?—Nick Riganas The film opens in New York City the Avengers battled the Chitauri. Salvage worker Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is showing his co-worker a drawing that his daughter made of the Avengers in action. They proceed to work on taking apart the Chitauri leviathan and gathering any tech they can get their hands on. Soon, a van from the U.S. Department of Damage Control arrives. Anne Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly) orders Toomes to shut down his operation, and adds that they will be confiscating all of their findings. Toomes protests and even punches a Damage Control agent when he makes a snide remark to him. Hoag then reasserts her demand to Toomes to give up his work.After learning that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is behind Damage Control, Toomes gathers three of his co-workers - Jackson Brice (Logan Marshall-Green), Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine), and Phineas Mason (Michael Chernus) - to continue their work in gathering Chitauri tech regardless of what they are told. Eight years later, Toomes and his guys are still at it, with Toomes using his Vulture suit to bring in a bag of Chitauri power core.Meanwhile, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is recording a video log as he travels to Berlin with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) for what is really Tony recruiting Peter to help him during the events ofCaptain America: Civil War (2016). Happy shows off the new Spider-Man suit that Tony made for Peter, which he gets super excited about. He later records his fight alongside Iron Man and everyone on his loyalist side during the airport fight against Captain America and the other Avengers. Tony then brings Peter home in his limo, leaving him eager for their next mission.Two months later, Peter is still waiting to hear back from Happy over any new missions. He goes back to being a normal student at Midtown High School. Peter makes plans with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) to build a Lego Death Star. Peter also has a crush on a senior named Liz (Laura Harrier) and is frequently taunted by snotty rich kid Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori). When not at school, Peter continues going around the city as Spider-Man to help people as well as fight crime. Peter refers to his Spidey work as the Stark internship, and as a result, he quits his school's decathlon team. While at school, Peter secretly creates new web fluid for his shooters.One night, Spidey catches four crooks with Avengers masks trying to rob a bank using high-tech equipment. Spidey shows up and fights the criminals, until one of them uses a device that emits a powerful blast, blowing up not only the bank, but also the bodega across the street. Spidey rushes over to save the owner of the bodega (and his cat).Peter quietly returns to his room through his window while not trying to let Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) know that he was out. He crawls across the ceiling and comes down to find Ned sitting on his bed, holding the completed Lego Death Star. He drops it and it breaks upon Ned's discovery that Peter is Spider-Man. Ned is shocked but also thrilled. Peter forces him to keep it a secret.Peter later goes with May to dinner. May is trying to get the silent Peter, and Peter admits that he's been tired out from the ""Stark Internship,"" with May admitting to not being a fan of Stark. They see footage of the bank robbery, and May warns Peter not to go anywhere near that type of chaos in the city.The entire next day at school, Ned asks Peter questions about being Spider-Man. They even watch a PSA from Captain America (Chris Evans) during gym, and Peter briefly mentions fighting him. The boys then hear Liz talking to her friends about how she's got kind of a crush on Spider-Man, leading Ned to blurt out in front of everyone that Peter knows Spider-Man. Liz then invites Peter and Ned to a party at her house so that Peter can try to invite Spider-Man.The boys attend the party, and almost instantly, Ned tries to get Peter to change into his Spider-Man outfit. Peter doesn't want to until Flash starts pestering him. He goes to change, but then sees an explosion in the distance. He goes to investigate and finds Brice and Schultz selling Chitauri tech to a local gangster named Aaron Davis (Donald Glover). Peter's cell goes off when Ned tries to call him, making Brice and Schultz think Aaron was setting them up. Spidey intervenes and tries to fight the crooks. He chases them until Vulture swoops down and grabs Spidey. He drops him into the river as he gets tangled in his parachute. Iron Man then comes down and saves Spidey, finding out where he was because of a tracker in his suit. Tony is not in the suit as he is basically calling Peter, but he tells him to stay out of crime-fighting for his own good. Peter considers returning to the party, but Ned has him hear on the phone that Flash has everyone mocking Peter. Peter then finds a weapon that one of the crooks left behind.At Toomes's lair, Brice admits to dropping his weapon as he was using his electric gauntlets (calling himself ""Shocker""). Fed up with Brice's carelessness, Toomes cuts him from the team, but Brice threatens to spill their secrets to Toomes' wife and the public. Toomes responds by grabbing a powerful gun off Mason's desk and incinerating Brice with it (mistaking an anti-gravity gun for a laser gun). He then gives Schultz the gauntlets so he can be Shocker.With Ned's help, Peter cracks open the weapon to find a power core. He finds Schultz again and places a tracker on him, discovering that he is going to Maryland. To get there, Peter rejoins the decathlon team as they head to D.C. for the Nationals competition.Peter sneaks out and goes to find Schultz as Spider-Man. He catches the villains attempting to hijack a Damage Control truck with more weaponry inside. During his attempt to foil the villains, Spidey is knocked unconscious and wakes up in a Damage Control warehouse, unable to leave because the door is sealed until the morning. Peter talks to the A.I. system in his suit, whom he refers to as Karen (voiced byJennifer Connelly). She helps Peter get a better understanding of how his suit works. He even tells her about his feelings for Liz. He also learns that the power core is basically a bomb that will go off when exposed to radiation. When he realizes he is about to miss the competition, Peter has Karen help him unlock the doors as he rushes to the competition.Peter misses the whole competition, but the team wins thanks to the help of reserved loner Michelle Jones (Zendaya). The team then heads over to the Washington Monument. He calls Ned to warn him about the power core that he was holding, but is unable to get the message through. As Spidey, he rushes to the Monument, but the core goes off in Ned's backpack as the team is riding up the elevator. Spidey climbs up the Monument to save the team, but he can't get in through the window without using great force. The police arrive in choppers and order Spidey to get to the ground. Against their orders, Spidey leaps over the choppers and swings from the bottom. He breaks in and tries to hold the falling elevator with his web, but the weight pulls him down. He is able to hold the web and the elevator as everyone inside climbs out. Liz is the last person and nearly falls with the elevator but Spidey catches her with the web and rescues her.Back in New York, Karen reveals that the Spider-Man suit records everything that Peter has seen. She gets a visual on Aaron, and Spidey later finds him in a parking garage. He attempts to interrogate him to find out why he was trying to get the tech from Toomes's goons. Aaron says he was trying to get them out of his neighborhood. He figures that Spidey is new to being a hero. Aaron tells Spidey that Toomes is meeting to gather more tech at the Staten Island Ferry later that afternoon.On the Ferry, Toomes is meeting with another criminal named Mac Gargan (Michael Mando). Spidey gets a call from Tony, but he lies about what he's up to. Spidey spots Schultz on the boat but sees Toomes and doesn't realize he is Vulture. He swings in and incapacitates Gargan and his goons. Toomes tries to use a weapon on Spidey, but he holds it down with his webbing. This backfires since the weapon becomes unstable and splits the Ferry in half. Spidey then tries to hold the Ferry together with his webbing, but it's not strong enough and it continues to split. As Spidey holds on as much as he can, Iron Man and his little drones show up to put the Ferry back together and save everyone.Spidey retreats to a rooftop. Iron Man finds him and chews him out for not listening to him and lying to him about what he's doing with the suit. Peter then attempts to put the blame on Tony for what happened with the Ferry for not listening to him about the Vulture, but Tony steps out of his suit this time and reveals that he DID in fact listen to Peter, as he sent the FBI on the same Ferry that Toomes was on. He goes on to remind Peter that, while nobody got harmed, if somebody did, it would've been on Peter. Feeling that he's unworthy of it, Tony demands that Peter give him back the Spidey suit. Peter pleads with Tony, saying that he's nothing without the suit, to which Tony says that he doesn't deserve it if he's nothing without it. Peter is failed to convince Tony to let him stay with the suit. He goes home to Aunt May dejectedly. She gets on him for not answering his phone all day, even going to the police to find out where he was. She also knows about him skipping detention at school earlier that day, that he missed out on the Decathlon competition in Washington, AND he sneaks out of the house every night. Demanding an explanation, he admits to getting fired from the Internship.Peter resumes his life as a student and spends more time with Ned. Peter finds Liz at school and admits to liking her, which she already knew. He then asks her to the homecoming dance, which she accepts.On the night of the dance, Peter goes to pick up Liz, only to learn that her father is none other than...ADRIAN TOOMES. After some awkward photos, Toomes drives Peter and Liz to the dance. As Liz tells Adrian about Peter's background and the events at Washington, he slowly starts putting together the pieces of Peter's circumstances and realizes that he's Spider-Man. Liz leaves the car, and Toomes quietly threatens Peter by telling him to stay out of his business or else he will kill him and anyone he cares about.During the dance, Peter learns that Toomes plans to steal a shipment of weaponry from a plane coming from the Avengers Tower heading to their new headquarters. Peter ditches Liz and rushes to get his homemade Spider-Man suit to stop Toomes. He heads outside and is attacked by Schultz with his gauntlets. Peter tries to reach his web shooter, but Schultz continues to pummel him. He is saved by Ned, and Peter sticks Schultz to a bus with the webbing.Spidey rushes to stop Toomes with Ned being his eyes and ears. Ned tries to get in touch with Happy, but he doesn't care about it and hangs up on him. Spidey finds Toomes in his lair. Toomes attempts to reason with Peter that he's only doing what he believes is necessary and that the world isn't as black and white as the young Peter believes it to be, but it turns out to be a distraction as Toomes unleashes his suit as it flies around the area, destroying support beams and causing a pile of debris to fall on Spidey. Toomes leaves him to die. Peter struggles to lift the rubble off of him and he fears he is going to die. He then remembers Tony's words, he uses all his strength to pull himself out and he'll have to do it all alone without Tony's help.Spidey latches onto Vulture's suit as he intercepts the plane. Toomes tries to gather what he needs, but Spidey foils his plan. Toomes gets in his suit and fights Spidey on the plane. They knock out the turbines, sending the plane toward Coney Island. Spidey is able to maneuver the plane away from the city and onto the beach as it crash-lands. Toomes attempts to get away with the weaponry, but Spidey tries to warn him that they are about to explode. Toomes tries flying away anyway, but the cores blow up and he goes crashing down. Spidey finds Toomes and saves him, but he leaves him next to the rest of the weaponry for Happy and the police to find later, leading to Toomes getting arrested.At school, Peter finds out that Liz is moving to Oregon with her mother while her father is on trial. She is still upset with Peter for leaving her at the dance. She says goodbye to Peter and hopes that he can figure himself out. Peter is back on the decathlon team, and Michelle is made captain. She quickly mentions that her nickname is MJ. Peter then gets a text to go to the bathroom. Happy is there, thanking Peter for what he did. He then tells Peter that Tony wants to see him.Tony and Happy bring Peter to the new Avengers HQ. Tony presents Peter with a brand new Spider-Man suit, telling him that there are reporters behind the wall waiting for a big announcement, meaning Tony is about to officially make Peter a new Avenger. However, Peter turns Tony down, saying he prefers to be a ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" for now. Peter leaves, and asks Tony if he was testing him and whether or not he passed, and Tony seemingly confirms it adding that there are no reporters. However, Tony is actually surprised that Peter made the mature choice of turning him down, and that there really were a bunch of reporters outside. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes out, asking where Peter is. She is frustrated that he walked out, so Happy covers for them by giving Tony a ring so he can propose to Pepper.When Peter gets home, he finds a bag from Tony on his bed. Tony is convinced and has given Peter back the original Spider-Man suit. Peter then proudly puts it on...not realizing Aunt May is behind him, leading her to blurt out ""WHAT THE F--"".Mid-Credits Scene: Toomes is locked up at The Raft and he runs into Gargan, who mentions that he and other criminals are trying to come together to kill Spider-Man. Gargan then reveals that he heard a rumor of Toomes knowing who Spider-Man is. Toomes denies it, saying Spider-Man would already be dead if he knew. He then leaves Gargan to see Liz and his wife visiting him.After-Credits Scene: Captain America shows up in another PSA talking about patience, and how sometimes being patient leads to things that aren't worth it. He then asks the off-screen director of the PSAs how many more PSA videos he has to work on."

Richie is the only one that hasn't been haunted, but he admits to being terrified of clowns.The kids go to Bill's garage where they look over a map of Derry through a projector. They see that the sewers are linked to the Neibolt house, where IT lives. The projector then starts working itself, showing pictures of Bill and Georgie with their parents, but with Pennywise's face appearing over their mother.

He starts pulling the rope up to prevent the boys from climbing back up. Henry tries to kill Mike with the nail gun that he brought, but Mike fights him off and manages to push him down the well, sending him to his apparent death.Going further into the well, Stan is attacked by IT as the woman from the painting. She munches on his head, but the boys scare IT away and comfort a mortified Stan.All the boys head further into the well where they find IT's lair. All the children he's taken are floating up in the dead-lights under some kind of trance. The boys find Bev floating. They pull her down, and Ben kisses her to break her out of the trance. Bill then sees Georgie emerge from the shadows. Georgie tells Bill he missed him and was waiting for him to come for him. Bill hugs his brother, but he knows it's not really Georgie, and he shoots him in the head. His body writhes on the ground until he turns into Pennywise. The clown tries to kill the kids, but they fight him off until he has his hold on Bill. Pennywise gives the others the option to die together, or leave him with just Bill. Bill tells them to run, but Richie is the first to fight back. The kids then start beating the crap out of Pennywise until he is powerless, unable to hurt them because they no longer fear him. Before Bill can strike the fatal blow to the clown's cracking skull, Pennywise retreats into the darkness and thus escapes. The kidnapped children then float downward. Bill then finds Georgie's raincoat. He realizes that Georgie truly is gone. Bill breaks down in tears as his friends gather around and hug him.It is now September. The Losers swear a blood oath to return to Derry in 27 years should IT ever return. They hang out for a while until each of them gradually leaves, with only Bill and Bev stay behind. She is going to move to Portland now. As she walks away, Bill runs up to her and kisses her.END OF CHAPTER ONE"

Thor (Chris Hemsworth), having failed in his quest to locate the Infinity Stones and having also been dumped by Jane (although he insists it was a 'mutual dumping') is hanging in chains above a fire pit before being brought before the monstrous fire demon Surtur. Surtur believes his destiny is to bring about Ragnarok, the complete destruction of Asgard. Thor learns from Surtur that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is not on Asgard, so uses Mjolnir (his hammer) to escape and destroy Surtur, keeping his crown/skull, the demon's power source. Thor returns to Asgard and sends Surtur's skull down to the vaults but then finds Heimdall (Idris Elba) has been replaced as sentry of the Bifrost Bridge by the inept Skurge (Karl Urban) who explains that Odin accused Heimdall of treachery. Heimdall subsequently fled and his whereabouts are unknown.Reaching Asgard, Thor sees a massive statue of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) as well as Odin lounging around, enjoying a play about Loki's 'heroic sacrifice' while fighting the Dark Elves. Realizing what's happened, Thor quickly forces Loki (who usurped and disguised himself as Odin prior to the end of 'Thor: The Dark World') to drop his charade and demands to know what happened to Odin. It is revealed that Loki had placed Odin under a spell and dumped him in a retirement home in New York City. By the time they get there, it is being demolished. Before they can plan their next move, Loki is suddenly pulled through a dimensional hole in the sidewalk and a card with an address (177a Bleecker St) is left behind. Thor goes there and finds Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), the mystic guardian of Earth, who agrees to help him find Odin on the condition that all Asgardians leave Earth. Thor agrees, and after doing some research (during which Thor is constantly teleported around Strange's Sanctum, a disorienting experience) Doctor Strange deduces that Odin is in Norway. He then releases Loki from his endless fall, and when Loki tries to attack an exasperated Strange, the doctor unceremoniously sends them both through another portal.They find Odin in Norway sitting near a scenic cliff (having shaken off Loki's spell) and he admits that he is dying and Ragnarok is approaching. Thor insists that when he destroyed Surtur, he prevented Ragnarok. Odin mentions Hela (Cate Blanchett), his true firstborn child, the goddess of death and the one who will seize Asgard from Odin's sons. Odin tells Thor and Loki that their (previously unknown) sister was completely consumed by darkness and was sealed away, the only force that continues her exile is Odin himself. He apologizes to Thor for failing him before dying and disappearing. As soon as he's gone, Hela emerges from her prison and engages the two in brief small talk. Seeing that she won't be reasoned with, Thor throws Mjolnir toward her however the goddess easily catches and effortlessly shatters the long-indestructible weapon. Loki, seeing they don't stand a chance, asks to be returned to Asgard via the Bifrost, however, Hela also enters the portal, expels Loki and then Thor from it at different points, and reaches Asgard. Arriving at the Bifrost Bridge, she quickly kills Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fendral (Zachary Levi) before recruiting a terrified Skurge to her cause. She then heads to Asgard where she kills the entire palace guard single-handedly as well as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano).Thor is deposited by the portal on a planet, Sakaar, which seems to consist entirely of gigantic garbage mounds, fed by giant portals in the skies. He's attacked by several scavengers. Now weaponless, he is quickly overpowered before his attackers are scared off by the hard-drinking bounty hunter Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). However, she then captures Thor, placing a small shocking device on his neck to pacify him, and takes him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who is delighted with his newest acquisition and decides to put him up against his champion fighter. Thor learns that Loki is also present and has been there for weeks (time moving far quicker on the Grandmaster's planet) during which he has found favor with the Grandmaster. Not wishing to jeopardize his position, Loki pretends not to care about his brother, and Thor is thrown in the dungeons where he befriends rock creature Korg who explains that all who have gone up against the champion have been killed. Meanwhile, Hela enters Asgard's throne room and pulls down the fresco above the throne depicting Odin and the royal family and their benevolent rule of their kingdom and the universe, revealing the darker history of Asgard where Odin and Hela conquered the Nine Realms before she was banished by her father. Hela then heads down to Asgard's vaults and uses Asgard's Eternal Flame to restore her entire army and revive her monstrous wolf, Fenris. (She also dismisses the Infinity Gauntlet that is kept there as a fake). She then attempts to open a portal and conquer all the realms but the Bifrost sword has been taken by Heimdall who has been hiding in the hills and is now sheltering the escaping civilians from Asgard.Thor is taken to the arena and put up against the champion who is revealed to be none other than the Incredible Hulk. Thor is overjoyed to see his old teammate, however, the Hulk attacks him. The two bash each other around the area, Thor gaining the upper hand. He tries using Natasha Romanov's calming technique to make him transform back into Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) however it doesn't work and Hulk thrashes him (Loki is very unsettled to again see the creature that gave him a sound beating during his attempted conquest of Earth). Eventually, Thor stops holding back and begins to fight, at one point having a vision of Odin causing him to channel raw lightning. However, just when he is about to win the Grandmaster, not wanting to see a crowd (and his own) favorite be beaten, shocks Thor into submission. As the Hulk leaps into the air to crush Thor, Thor puts his hand up in defense before everything goes black.On Asgard, Hela has the remaining people rounded up and demands to know where the Bifrost sword is. When no one comes forward, Hela tells Skurge to execute a random person. Skurge hesitates but is still about to do it, but before he can make the kill someone comes forward with Heimdall's location.Thor wakes up later in the Hulk's chamber, being pampered by several beautiful women. Thor speaks to Hulk privately (Hulk is now able to speak far more intelligently than he was able to in his last appearance) and learns that he hasn't transformed back into Banner since leaving Earth two years earlier. The Hulk points out that the Quinjet he left Earth with is still in one piece and could be used to escape. He also learns that Valkyrie is an Asgardian who was part of an elite all-female group who were sent up against Hela during her previous assault but were all killed (Valkyrie being the only survivor). Thor tries to convince her to help, but she initially refuses. Although Hulk is happy in his life and wants to stay, he does help Thor acquire the control device for his electronic restraint -- Thor pickpockets it from Valkyrie and removes the shocker from his neck. Thor escapes from Hulk's apartment and reaches the Quinjet, but is chased by Hulk who smashes it half apart. However, Thor then plays Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) last message to him (fromAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)), prompting the Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner. Thor explains to Banner, whose last memories are of Sokovia during Ultron's offensive, what has happened. Banner, unable to believe Hulk was able to remain in control for two years, doesn't want to transform again knowing that if he does he might remain the Hulk forever. Valkyrie meets up with Loki and the two engage in a brief fight, and after Loki learns where she comes from he uses his powers to make her remember her last encounter with Hela. Valkyrie has a change of heart and she decides to help Thor return to Asgard, and shows her good will by beating and chaining up Loki. Reuniting, Thor and Loki head down to steal a ship however Loki attempts to betray Thor to the Grandmaster. Thor, expecting such a move by Loki, places the shocking device onto Loki's back. Thor tells his brother he'd hoped he would at least show some capacity for growth and even begin to change for the better, but now he understands Loki will always be a trickster. He then leaves the shocking device turned on with the remote just out of reach.Thor, Banner and Valkyrie steal the Grandmaster's party/orgy ship and, escaping the Grandmaster's clutches, leave through a passageway known as the Devil's Anus. Reaching Asgard just as Hela is about to destroy the remaining population who had attempted to escape through the Bifrost Bridge, Thor engages her in a vicious battle but is still overpowered and loses an eye. Feeling he is useless without his hammer, Thor has a vision of Odin who explains to his son that the hammer simply channeled his powers, reminding him he is the God of Thunder. Odin also tells him that Asgard is not a place but it's people and they can re-establish their society and culture anywhere. Now realizing his full abilities, Thor unleashes a massive lightning bolt repelling Hela. As Valkyrie and Heimdall attempt to hold off Hela's army, Loki unites with Korg and other escaping fighters and procures a ship which he uses to evacuate the Asgardians. Banner also transforms back into Hulk to fight off Fenris. Skurge, feeling guilt over having allied himself with Hela, sacrifices himself to ensure the ship is able to escape.Thor unites with Valkyrie and Loki knowing Hela will soon be back as she is only growing stronger from Asgard's power. Thor suddenly realizes that he cannot stop Ragnarok but must instead bring it about to defeat Hela, and sends Loki down to the vaults to throw Surtur's skull into the Eternal Flame. Loki does so and escapes (it's also heavily implied that he takes the opportunity to steal the Tessaract) just as Surtur is resurrected and starts laying waste to the kingdom. Hela mounts an offense but it is little use -- Surtur is too powerful and destroys her with his sword. Thor escapes with Loki, Hulk, Heimdall, Valkyrie, Korg and the surviving civilians/prisoners just before Asgard is completely decimated. Although Thor is upset about the destruction of his home, he knows it was necessary to prevent the extinction of his people. He then finally meets his destiny and takes the 'throne' (the captain's chair on the bridge) where his first order is to return to Earth.Mid-Credits Scene:Loki worries over Thor's decision to return to Earth knowing he won't be very welcome there since on his last visit he tried to take over the planet. Thor assures his brother he feels everything will be fine, just as a menacing ship that dwarfs their own appears through the window.Post-Credits Scene:The Grandmaster, who had been chasing Thor, crashes on the garbage planet where he is confronted by the scavengers who are also a bunch of former slaves. He congratulates them on their revolt and agrees to call it a tie."

Barry and Victor go to the cemetery to dig up Superman's grave.The League goes to the Kryptonian ship in Metropolis with the Box and Superman's body. When Cyborg tells them the control panel is burned out, The Flash devises a plan to charge the field; he'll run from a distance to build a stronger charge. It works and Superman comes back to life, immediately rocketing out of the ship, and the others go after him. They find him nearby, at his memorial that was damaged in the battle with Doomsday. He scans them with his X-ray vision while Cyborg's defense system activates on its own. He fires a blast at Superman, leading him to attack the others.

He hears the panicked voices of nearby civilians and rushes off to help them, guiding The Flash to the family that was attempting to flee the site. The Flash pushes their truck to safety and then sees Superman carrying an entire apartment building to safety.Superman returns to the power plant where Cyborg has reassembled the leg Steppenwolf pulled from his body. Together, Superman and Cyborg pull the Boxes apart, stopping the transformation process. Enraged, Steppenwolf tries to finish them off himself, but Superman uses his ice breath to freeze Steppenwolf's ax, allowing Diana to shatter it with her sword. Now weakened and bewildered, the Parademons sense Steppenwolf's fear and begin to tear him apart as they are sent back to their world.Later, the heroes return to their homes.

Logan,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3315342/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a future where mutants are nearly extinct, an elderly and weary Logan leads a quiet life. But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety. In 2029 the mutant population has shrunk significantly due to genetically modified plants designed to reduce mutant powers and the X-Men have disbanded. Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because they made her, with Logan's DNA. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over. In the not-so-distant 2029, the entire mutant race is almost obliterated, and Logan, the invincible bestial superhero once known as the Wolverine, finds himself getting old, and his incredible healing ability significantly weakened. As an incognito limo driver, Logan does his best to guard and keep out of sight a weary nonagenarian Professor Xavier; however, things will take an unexpected turn when a cryptic woman asks him to transport the young mutant girl, Laura. A better future lies past the Canadian borders for the unaccompanied teenager, but the government is unwilling to let go of its asset so easily. In the end, can the ageing Logan protect both himself and Laura?—Nick Riganas In a dystopian 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan's healing ability has weakened and he has physically aged. The Adamantium coating on his skeleton has begun to leach into his body, poisoning him. Hiding in plain sight, Logan spends his days working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban care for 90-year-old Charles Xavier, Logan's mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles, a telepath, has developed a form of dementia that causes him to have seizures unless controlled with medication. It is alluded that a seizure one year prior, releasing a destructive wave of his telepathic powers, had killed seven mutants, thus leaving the three (Logan, Charles, Caliban) as the last of the X-Men. The theatrical release of Logan was preceded by the short filmDeadpool: No Good Deed (2017).Logan (Hugh Jackman), formerly the Wolverine, wakes up in the back of a limo, groggy and disheveled. It's the middle of the night. He stumbles out and finds a Mexican gang trying to steal the limo's wheels. Logan calmly attempts to intervene but one of the gang members blasts him with a shotgun. Standing up, Logan reveals his claws, an act that is evidently painful, but one doesn't extend all the way. He fights the gang, receiving his share of abuse as they beat him down, but manages to brutally maim and kill most of them before the rest run away.The year is 2029. Looking no older than 50, Logan has still aged to over 170 years and is no longer the same fighter he once was. His superhuman healing ability is failing and the adamantium in his body is slowly killing him. As a result, his body aches and he coughs up blood on occasion. Mutants are on the brink of extinction and no new ones have been born in 25 years. Logan now makes a living driving for a limo service in El Paso, Texas under his birth name, James Howlett. He also carries an adamantium bullet with him in case he ever decides to end it all.While he waits for a client at a funeral, he is approached by a woman named Gabriela Lopez (Elizabeth Rodriguez). She claims to know who he is and asks for his help, but Logan turns her away. Gabriela drives off as a young girl in the back seat stares at Logan.One morning a man enters Logan's limo, introducing himself as Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). He appears to know much about Logan, saying he's aware of his unofficial participation in the killing of the gang members and alludes to Logan's side job as caretaker for one Charles Xavier just south of the border. Pierce says he knows Logan was contacted by a person of interest and claims that he only wants what Gabriela has; something she took from him. He hands Logan a card and tells him to call when he finds Gabriela again. The card reads that Donald is head of security at 'Alkali-Transigen', a biotechnological corporation. Logan drives off, furious.Logan heads into Mexico to an abandoned plant where he and the clairvoyant mutant Caliban (Stephen Merchant), an albino psychic, are taking care of Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Charles has been reduced to a shell of his former self, crippled and suffering from a degenerative brain disease which produces seizures. Thanks to his mutation, the seizures produce staggering psionic blasts which paralyze anyone within reach. Logan must administer a special serum to keep Xavier's episodes under control, though the doses often leave him confused and senile. Xavier has become broken since the loss of his school and fellow X-Men some time ago and says that Logan is just waiting for him to die.Logan argues with Caliban about obtaining enough medicine for Xavier. Caliban explains that it's hard caring for Xavier, especially when Logan won't communicate about his own needs which are more than evident to the albino. Logan storms off. Later he receives a notification for two passengers and drives to a motel. There, he comes across Gabriela again with the young girl whom Gabriela says is her 11 year old daughter, Laura (Dafne Keen). She offers Logan $50,000 to help them reach a place called 'Eden' in North Dakota en route to Canada before handing him an envelope with coordinates written on it and $20,000 inside. Logan reluctantly agrees and heads home to prepare. There, he tells Xavier that their dream of leaving and buying a boat may actually become reality.However, when he returns to the motel, he finds that Gabriela has been murdered and Laura is missing. Logan takes Gabriela's cell phone and finds she was in the process of sending him a text telling him to hurry as they've been found. Logan returns home, dejected, but is stunned to find that Laura has stowed away in the trunk of his limo. Xavier excitedly hosts the young girl and tries to convince Logan that she needs their help. However, Logan correctly predicts that she'll be found and, soon enough, Pierce comes knocking at their door. Logan claims Laura is not there and, when Pierce persists, Laura throws a pipe at his head, knocking him out. Logan tells Caliban to take Pierce out into the desert and leave him there. Caliban dresses heavily to protect his sensitive skin from the sun and carts Pierce's body away, but a squad of elites from Transigen, the Reavers, arrive. They pick up Pierce and capture Caliban.The Reavers return to the plant and two enter to retrieve Laura, who is calmly eating a bowl of cereal, while Logan and the others wait outside. They all hear commotion from inside, including screams and gunfire. Laura appears, throwing the head of one of the Reavers at Pierce's feet. She then steps forward, producing two adamantium claws from each of her hands and one from each foot and viciously attacks the Reavers. A stunned Logan finally helps her fight and flees the scene in the limo with Xavier and Laura in the backseat. Caliban is taken by the Reavers and tortured with sunlight in order to get him to use his powers to track the trio.Logan demands to know who Laura is and Xavier responds that she is very much like him. Logan looks through Gabriela's phone for clues and finds a video which reveals that she used to work for Transigen in the genetics department. However, the phone dies before the video can finish. They stop at a convenience store to stock up on supplies. The clerk (Dave Davis) attempts to stop Laura from shoplifting some chips and sunglasses but she easily flips him over and nearly claws him before Logan intervenes, saying ""Not okay"". He then takes a phone charger and cigar and leaves.That night, as the phone charges, Logan watches the rest of Gabriela's video. She had documented her role as a nurse in the genetic experimentation of new mutant children, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant), with the intention of turning them into super soldiers. Using DNA from known mutants, most of whom were deceased, the children were conceived and born to anonymous mothers who would not be missed. The children, including Laura, were dubbed X-23 and raised under harsh conditions. Simple pleasures, such as birthdays, were frowned upon. The experiment was deemed a failure due to the fact that the children sustained too much emotion and often refused to follow orders. With the introduction of X-24, it was decided the children would be terminated. Rather than see them killed, Gabriela helped orchestrate an escape and the location of Eden was designated as a safe point so the children could live free in Canada. In the video's final moments, Gabriela admits that she is not Laura's mother but loves her all the same. Addressing Logan, she apologizes for lying about the total fee that she would pay him but hopes that, as her biological father, he will keep her safe.The trio enter Oklahoma City and take residence in a hotel where Logan discovers that Laura has been reading an X-Men comic book. He finds that the coordinates to Eden are included in the book and is convinced that the whole trip is a charade. Angry, he confronts Laura to Xavier's disdain and tells her the X-Men stories she's been reading are fantasized and that Eden does not exist. Logan leaves Xavier and Laura in their room and goes downstairs where he sees that the Reavers have followed them. Suddenly, everyone becomes paralyzed and Logan realizes Xavier is suffering another seizure. Having ever been the only one able to partially resist the effects, Logan struggles to make it back to the room where some of the Reavers have already found Laura and Xavier. Logan kills them all before injecting Xavier with his serum, ending the paralysis, and the three escape in a new vehicle.On the road, a report goes over the incident in Oklahoma City and relates the similarity to an event that occurred in Westchester one year prior, but Logan turns off the radio. They are nearly run off the road by a robotic freight truck and swerve to avoid a pickup hauling a trailer full of horses. Xavier convinces Logan to help and uses his telepathic powers to bring the horses back. The driver introduces himself as Will Munson (Eriq La Salle) accompanied by his wife Kathryn (Elise Neal) and son Nate (Quincy Fouse). Logan then helps push their pickup out of a ditch. Kathryn offers Logan and his 'family' to have dinner with them which Xavier happily accepts.Logan is eager to leave immediately after dinner but Kathryn offers them to spend the night as it's late. Logan only agrees for Xavier's sake and carries him upstairs to bed. Seeing that their water supply has been tampered with, Will goes out to investigate and Logan tags along. They find and fix the obvious leak at the pump some distance away and are confronted by a group of thugs led by a man who owns the land. He harasses Will, saying he's been skimping on payments, but Logan hits one of the thugs in the face with his own rifle and breaks it over his knee, scaring them off.Back at the house, Xavier lies in bed and senses Logan entering the room. He tearfully pleads with him to be patient with Laura, asleep on the floor beside him, and expresses regret and remorse over what happened a year ago. It is implied that Xavier suffered a massive seizure at his school in Westchester which resulted in the deaths of most of the X-Men. He apologizes but Logan pushes his claws through Xavier's chest. Laura attacks in Charles' defense. The attacker turns out to be a mindless and merciless clone of Logan, the X-24. The mutant abducts Laura and slaughters Nate and Kathryn. Upon returning, Will is struck down by the X-24 and Logan rushes upstairs to get Xavier who is just barely alive. Logan consoles him, ""It wasn't me"", as he carries him downstairs.Outside, the Reavers wait with Pierce and Dr. Rice. Caliban is confined in a surveillance van. The thugs who abused Will before arrive at the house in retaliation for their earlier humiliation but X-24 kills them all. Logan sets Xavier down in the bed of a pickup truck. Charles utters the name of their boat and dies. Bereaved, Logan engages X-24 in a furious fight. Meanwhile, Caliban fights back against his captors and sets off two grenades, muttering the phrase his mother once told him: ""Beware the light."" The van explodes and Pierce is thrown out while Rice escapes. Logan is nearly overpowered by the X-24 until Will rams into the mutant with his truck, pinning him against some farm equipment. Will repeatedly shoots X-24 with a shotgun and then turns the gun on Logan. The gun is out of shots and Will collapses, dead. Logan retrieves Laura and takes her with Xavier's body and drives away. The following morning, Dr. Rice and his crew take care of the scene and inject X-24 with an agent to help him heal.Logan buries Charles in an unmarked grave in the woods while Laura watches. Afterwards, he goes back to their truck and begins smashing it in fury before passing out. Later, Logan wakes up in a clinic. The doctor (James Handy) tells Logan he knows he's a mutant and says he wants to help him, aware that the adamantium in his body is killing him. Logan refuses and leaves with Laura. He begrudgingly thanks her and she finally speaks by responding 'you're welcome' in Spanish. Logan is perplexed as to why she never spoke before, but Laura begins rattling in Spanish the names of her friends from Transigen. She tells Logan they must meet up with them in Eden and presses him with such persistence that Logan finally concedes, but only to prove Eden doesn't exist.The two just barely make it and Logan is drained to the point of unconsciousness, so much that Laura had to drive the remaining miles there. At a cliff, a lift is dropped for Logan so they can ascend and he and Laura are finally able to rest along with the remaining children led by Rictor (Jason Genao). The kids prank Logan by shaving his beard in his sleep to more closely resemble how he looked in his youth, but Logan is not amused. Rictor gives Logan a serum that was used on them in Transigen to help him re-energize and heal, but he warns Logan not to use it all at once. Logan then tells Laura that he's done his job in delivering her to Eden and emotionally explains that everyone he cares about dies and it's better he leaves. Laura bitterly responds that she should be fine, then.In the morning, the children are gone and Logan is about to leave when he sees that the Reavers have caught up to them, tracking the children. Logan runs to intercept them as the Reavers pick off the children one by one. Despite using their powers, the children are outnumbered. Injecting all of the healing agent at once, Logan kills most of the Reavers and confronts Dr. Rice who has rounded up the children and is holding them at gunpoint. Rice reveals that he is actually the son of the man killed by Wolverine when he escaped the Weapon X project. Rice admits responsibility for the extinction of mutants thanks to a virus developed by Transigen that was seeped into food supplies. Before he can continue, Logan shoots him dead in a desperate move and goes after Pierce. However, X-24 is released and Logan fights his clone once more. Seeing that Pierce is in complete control of X-24, the children gang up on him and use their collective powers (electrocution, freezing, plant manipulation, etc.) to kill him.As the healing agent in Logan's body wears off, he becomes overpowered by his younger clone until X-24 finally impales Logan on a dead tree limb. Laura then uses the adamantium bullet Logan carried with him to shoot X-24 in the head, obliterating it. She runs to Logan and cuts him down from the tree, but Logan's wounds aren't healing. Logan tearfully tells Laura to run with the others; they're free. She cries, calling him 'Daddy' and Logan responds, ""So...this is what it feels like"" before he dies. The children bury Logan and raise a cross at the head of the grave as Laura recites from a Western, the movieShane (1953), that she and Xavier watched in the Oklahoma hotel:""A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mold. There's no living with the killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now you run on home to your mother... you tell her everything's alright. There are no more guns in the valley.""The children then leave, their future uncertain but free. Laura takes the cross on Logan's grave and tilts it sideways, to look like an X."

But can they do it before sunrise?—Nick Riganas An aspiring young guitar player, whose family has a classic hate for music, tries to find answers of his great Grandfather, which leads his search to his entrance to Tierra De Muertos, where all dead people get to live if they are remembered well. In there, the boy will not only discover his family's legacy, but his search will lead him to an unexpected truth in this Disney tale about love, hate, death, music, betrayal -- and most of all: Family.—Ivo Byrt In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera was the wife of a musician who left her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music. She banned music in the family and opened a shoe-making family business. Ninety-six years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family. He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes it, discovering that her father (whose face is torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel ignores his grandmother Elena's objections and leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and steals his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can see and be seen by his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead: to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living; Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with Ernesto and offers to help Miguel reach him.

Dunkirk,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. May/June 1940. Four hundred thousand British and French soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats in addition to its hard-pressed Navy to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.—grantss World War II. The enemy forces have cornered four hundred thousand British and French soldiers on the French coast at Dunkirk. A small number of primarily-French soldiers are guarding the perimeter, where the British and French soldiers are amassed, which is getting increasingly smaller as enemy forces advance. Most of those British and French soldiers are now on the beach waiting for destroyers to come and take them back to Britain. Each of the countries are taking care of their own. The British are leaving first and among those the wounded get first priority despite their taking up seven times the space of the able-bodied soldiers. An issue with Dunkirk is that there is only one dock the destroyers can access, which needs to be protected from the enemy bombs. As such, Churchill, newly elected, has put out a call for civilian watercraft to head to Dunkirk both to transport supplies and to transport soldiers from the beach to the destroyers or back to Britain if at all possible. Within this situation, four general stories are told. In one, Commander Bolton, the top British Naval officer on the ground, knows deep in his heart that the soldiers are largely sitting ducks on the beach as the enemy planes fly over. He knows that the situation is a catch-22 for the British in that they need to bring as many soldiers safely home as possible at the depletion of their military resources, which in turn they need to preserve for the day if, but more likely when, the enemies make their way onto British soil. In the second story, a squadron of three Royal Air Force Spitfires are amongst those limited air resources that are embarking in dog fights with enemy planes, while protecting the soldiers on the ground. In the process, they have to ensure their own safety in order to provide what is needed for the ground soldiers, which includes knowing about things like fuel levels and having enough to make their way back to home base whenever required. In the third story, two soldiers meet on the beach, the two of them knowing that the longer they remain on the beach, the likelier they are not to survive this skirmish. As such, they try to do whatever they need to to make it onto one of those destroyers or any other watercraft making its way back to Britain. However, making it aboard a ship does not necessarily ensure their survival, and in the final story, Mr. Dawson, his young-adult son Peter, and their seventeen-year-old friend George are on Dawson's pleasure craft making its way to Dunkirk to do their part in the war effort, all realizing the dangers involved. They have to decide at each step along the way if they will focus on personal problems or if they will continue on to assist in the war, as was their first priority when they left Britain.—Huggo In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable Naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, three hundred thirty thousand French, British, Belgian, and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.—Jwelch5742 Late May 1940. Already eight months into World War II,Adolf Hitler's formidable army sweeps into Belgium, and then, France is next. As a result, the outnumbered Allied Forces collapse under the sheer volume of the invader, and 400,000 troops find themselves with their backs to the cold North Sea, stranded on the sandy shores of the French coastal town of Dunkirk. Now, with the relentless German Luftwaffe hammering the beach, and with the distance between England and continental Europe just 33.3 kilometres across the Strait of Dover, the massive evacuation operation code-named Operation Dynamo commences, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels. As three Royal Air Force Spitfires try to fend off the Nazi attacks and buy some time, the grizzled civilian captain, Mr Dawson, his son, Peter, and his friend, George, struggle to rescue as many soldiers as they can, in a desperate operation that will serve as a pivotal point for the war effort, and become known as the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"".—Nick Riganas The film alternates between three different periods of time involving separate groups of people, leading up to their encounter at the Channel off the coast of Dunkirk, France. As such, the film follows a non-linear narrative.The opening text reads that, during World War II, the British and French armies have over 400,000 soldiers stranded on Dunkirk as they wait for the miracle of a rescue, or until they die.1. The Mole (One Week)Six British soldiers are walking through the desolate streets of Dunkirk. They are looking through abandoned houses for food, supplies, and water when they are fired at by unseen German soldiers. Five of the men are killed except for one, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead). He escapes the gunfire and makes it to the beach, where thousands of British soldiers line the beaches waiting to be evacuated while a few hundred others of soldiers lay dead, scattered around the beach. Tommy tries to find a spot to relieve himself when he sees a young soldier, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), burying another soldier in the sand. Tommy goes over to help him.The other soldiers look up as German Stuka Ju.87 dive bomber planes fly overhead and start dropping bombs. Many men are struck and killed or wounded, and Tommy prepares to go down as well, but the bombs miss him.Tommy finds a wounded soldier left for dead. He and Gibson pretend to be medics to carry the soldier on-board the ship tending to the wounded so they can be evacuated. They pass a group of French soldiers trying to get on but are being denied entry under orders. Tommy and Gibson are not allowed onto the boat with the injured soldier they carried, but they manage to hide out by the mole (the concrete structure separating the water) until the next vessel shows up for them. The boat they were attempting to board for is attacked by more German aircraft and sunk, but they save a soldier named Alex (Harry Styles) from being crushed.Meanwhile, Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) of the Royal Navy and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) are standing by the docks to negotiate the rescue and safe return of the soldiers. They opt to use boats to bring them back but determine that the mole is their only viable way to the destroyers.Tommy, Gibson, and Alex all gather on another British Red Cross vessel. They get a little bit of food and water. Alex meets Tommy and notices Gibson walking around looking uneasy. The boat is hit by a torpedo, and water begins to flood the lower decks. As the ship sinks, Gibson gets out of the ship and manages to open the hatch for Tommy, Alex, and a few other men to get out safely. They board a skiff back to the shore.Back on the beach, the surviving British soldiers join up with a small group of Scottish soldiers heading to a boat within the tide. The British soldiers hide in there, but since they are technically on German land, they soon get hit by bullets from German soldiers using the boat as target practice. The bullet holes start to leak in water. Alex suggests they throw Gibson out to lighten the boat, going so far as to accuse him of being a German spy since he hasn't spoken the whole time, possibly to disguise his accent. Speaking for the first time, Gibson reveals himself to be French and that he took the uniform and tags off another soldier (the one he was burying) so he can be evacuated. The boat floats out of Dunkirk but soon starts sinking. The soldiers make it out, except for Gibson, who gets caught on something and drowns.2. The Sea (One Day)The Royal Navy starts taking over private boats in an effort to rescue the soldiers stranded at Dunkirk. A mariner named Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) takes his own ship with his teenage son Peter (Tom Glyne-Carney) as opposed to allowing naval officers to commandeer it themselves. The two are joined by their young helper George (Barry Keoghan), who assures Mr. Dawson that he can be of good use to them.The boat passes a sunken British ship. They find a shell-shocked soldier (Cillian Murphy) in the water. Mr. Dawson asks his name, but the soldier is silent. George tries tending to him with some tea, but the soldier knocks it out of his hand. When the soldier learns from Mr. Dawson that they are headed to Dunkirk, the soldier desperately tries to take control of the boat from Mr. Dawson. The ensuing struggle leads to George falling to the bottom of the boat and hitting his head hard. Peter goes to tend to his wounds, while the soldier stops and sits quietly. George gradually starts to lose his eyesight. Peter tells his father, but Mr. Dawson says they have come too far to turn back for help.3. The Air (One Hour)Three Spitfire pilots fly over the sea to provide air support to the troops. The squadron leader, plus pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) and Collins (Jack Lowden), spot ME 109 German fighter planes in the sky and go after them. One of the Germans shoots down the squadron leader, leaving Farrier and Collins on their own. Farrier's fuel gauge is broken, so he does his best to preserve fuel and take the enemy plane down.Collins' plane is shot down, and he heads down to the water. He tries to break himself free from his cockpit, but with the cockpit jammed and flooding with water, he nearly drowns. Collins is broken out by Peter, as his father's boat has managed to reach him in time. They bring Collins on-board. From his later conversation with Mr. Dawson, we learn that Peter's older brother was an RAF pilot who died in the early weeks of the war.By this point, all groups come together on the waters.More private British boats show up on the waters to rescue the soldiers. The soldiers spot a minesweeper and head toward it until it is hit by one of the German bombers. The water fills with oil as the soldiers swim past it and get covered in it before it is ignited, killing several men. Farrier manages to shoot down the attacking German Do.17 bomber as he runs out of fuel and heads toward the beach to make a safe landing. Meanwhile, Peter, Collins, and the shivering soldier pull as many men onto the boat as they can, including Alex and Tommy. Alex points out to the Dawsons that George is dead. The nameless shell-shocked soldier, unaware that George has died, asks Peter if George will be okay. Peter lies, saying that he will be.After taking out another German bomber before it can destroy the mole, Farrier lands his plane slowly by the shore. He sets his plane on fire and is soon captured by German soldiers.The Dawsons return home following the rescue. Peter gets a picture of George and takes it to the local paper, so that the boy may be remembered as a hero.Bolton and Winnant mention having saved 338,000 men after only planning to rescue 30,000. Bolton stays to make sure the French can evacuate. He sees Winnant and the last of the British army off.In England, the British soldiers are sent home on a train. Alex thinks that they will be met with scorn upon returning for this defeat. He sees a newspaper with a message from Winston Churchill regarding the evacuation and, unable to handle the scorn, asks Tommy to read it. As Tommy reads it upon entering the station, a man approaches the window and hands Alex two beers. Other people welcome the soldiers back with applause. Tommy finishes reading Churchill's statement, which commends the bravery and efforts of the soldiers and the miraculous escape they just participated in. However, the quote goes on to remind the public that evacuations alone do not win wars but concludes with the vow never to surrender."

Chris and his girlfriend Rose go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend.

Rose tells them that they're visiting her family who live nearby. The officer asks to see Chris's ID, but Rose steps in and says that because he wasn't driving there's no need for that. The officer lets them go, and Chris tells Rose that it was hot the way she stood up for him against the racist policeman.Chris and Rose arrive at her parents' home. Her father, Dean Armitage, is an affable neurosurgeon who, yes, tells Chris that he would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have. Her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), is a strangely cold hypnotherapist. She offers to cure Chris of his nicotine addiction through hypnosis, but he doesn't feel cool with people tooling around in his head.The Armitages also have two on-site black helpers: Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid/housekeeper. Dean acknowledges that it looks bad, two wealthy white people having two helpers who are black, but they were hired to take care of his parents and Dean would have felt bad letting them go. There's definitely something off about both Walter and Georgina. They have a definite stiff Stepford artificial politeness about them. They also both speak using dated vernacular.Dean gives Chris a tour of the house and shows him old family photos. Dean claims that his father was a track runner who was beat out by Jesse Owens to compete in the 1936 Olympics in front of Hitler. And while that was sad for his dad, it was still great to have Hitler's Aryan idealism proven wrong. There are also photos of Rose's brother who will be joining them later. He's a surgeon like his dad, but he went through a rough patch.The family gets together for afternoon tea. Missy stirs her tea and lightly taps her spoon against the teacup three times (super important later). Missy asks about Chris' parents. Chris claims that his father left when he was young and his mother died after being hit by a car when he was 11. Georgina sort of short-circuits while pouring tea, and Missy tells her to go lie down and get some rest. The Armitages tell Rose that they're having their big party tomorrow. She's surprised and they remind her that it's the same day every year. Rose's brother Jeremy arrives. He's an aggressive spoiled rich kid.That night at dinner a drunk Jeremy starts talking to Chris about MMA fighting, saying that Chris would be a natural at it becomes he comes from hearty stock. He wants to spar, but Chris says that he has rules about play-fighting with drunks. Dean and Missy tell Jeremy that maybe it's time for him to go to bed.Chris and Rose retire to their room where she apologizes for her family and they go to sleep. In the middle of the night, Chris gets up and decides to sneak out for a cigarette. While outside he sees something in the distance charging at him. It's Walter! He heads straight for Chris, but makes a sharp turn at the last moment and runs off in another direction. Inside the house, Georgina is staring out a window. It turns out she's looking at her own reflection, not Chris. She adjusts her hair and Chris decides to head back inside.Before Chris can make it back to his room, Missy startles him by turning on a light. She says smoking is a bad habit and offers again to help him quit. He sits but mocks the notion of hypnotism, unaware that she IS slowly hypnotizing him, using her teaspoon as a focus object. She takes him back to the night his mom died when he was 11, and he tells her that his mother didn't come home from work and he was too scared to do anything, like call the police, that would make it real, so he just sat watching TV, nervously digging his nails into his bedposts. Present-day Chris is doing the same thing, digging his nails into the arms of the chair. She taps her teacup with her spoon three times and tells him to sink. Eleven-year-old Chris sinks into his bed, while present-day Chris sinks into blackness, seeing himself and Missy far above. His consciousness has left his body, which is paralyzed in the chair.He wakes in the morning and checks his phone. Rod has sent Chris a picture of him pretending to give his dog beer. His battery is low, so he plugs it in. Chris tells Rose that he thinks her mom hypnotized him last night; he has vague recollections of the evening.The Armitages' wealthy friends arrive for the big party. It's mostly older white people who say many inappropriate things to Chris: how he has a good build; because Tiger Woods golfs he must have a good swing too; are black guys better in bed, etc. Chris sneaks off and finds a blind man named Jim Hudson (Stephen Root) who says that all the people at the party are ignorant. He's an art dealer and Chris is well aware of who he is. Jim says that he's a fan of Chris's work. He recognizes the irony of a blind art dealer, but tells him that he has a really good assistant who is great at describing pieces. He envies Chris's eye. Jim says that he himself tried photography, but was never very good at it.When Chris goes back to mingling with the guests, he discovers another black guy. He's about Chris' age and Chris tries to bond with him, but he too is stiff and unnatural like Walter and Georgina. But something about him seems familiar to Chris. (Note: the sharp eye will notice that this is Andre from the opening scene.)Chris decides to check in with Rod again, and he finds his phone unplugged again. He plugs it in, calls Rod, and tells him everything that's been going on. Rod warns him that white people love to have sex slaves and he needs to get out of there. Rose finds Chris and he tells her how weird everything is and that his phone was unplugged again. She tells him he's just being paranoid because he's in an uncomfortable situation. He agrees and she leaves. Rod tells Chris to take a picture of the black guy and he will see if he remembers him. As Chris is about to leave, he's blocked by Georgina who apologizes for unplugging his cellular phone; she lifted it up while dusting the nightstand, and when it came unplugged she didn't want to mess with it further. He says that it's fine and that he didn't mean to rat her out. She doesn't understand. So he clarifies that he didn't mean to get her in trouble. She gets super weird and lets out a single tear while telling him that the Armitages treat her like family.Chris goes back outside and tries to discreetly take the familiar black man's picture with his cell phone, but has forgotten to turn off the flash. As soon as his phone flashes, the man changes. He goes from overly prim and proper to raving. His nose starts bleeding and he jumps at Chris telling him, ""Get out! Get the fuck out while you still can!""Rose is freaked out now too. She asks her dad what happened and he explains that the flash just caused the man to have a seizure. The man comes out and apologizes for upsetting everyone and says he must return home. Chris and Rose go for a walk and Chris tells her that he's sure he recognized the guy and that something strange is definitely going on. She agrees by saying that it did not seem like a seizure at all. Chris says that he'd really like to go home now. Rose reluctantly agrees. She says she will make up something to tell her parents.Back at the house, Dean is holding a silent auction with his guests, who hold up bingo cards to bid. Next to him is a picture of Chris. Jim Hudson wins the auction. The other guests all go home.Chris goes to pack his belongings and gets a call from Rod, who tells him that the guy in the picture is a guy they knew named Dre, who used to work at a movie theater but went missing some weeks ago. The phone battery dies. Chris notices that the closet door is open. He looks inside and finds a box filled with photos of Rose posed romantically with many other black guys. There are also photos of her with both Walter and Georgina, who don't at all resemble the robotic versions Chris has met. Apparently Chris isn't the first black guy Rose has been with after all!Rose returns and Chris says that he needs the keys to put their bags in the car. She looks for them in her purse as they make their way out of the house. Suddenly, Jeremy appears, blocking the front door. Dean and Missy are there too. Jeremy is ready to attack, but Missy and Dean tell him to calm down. Chris keeps telling Rose to get the keys. Missy and Dean tell Chris that they don't want him to leave. Chris asks for the keys again and Rose says, very calmly: ""You know I can't give you the keys."" Chris finally realizes that Rose too is in on whatever this is. Jeremy attacks Chris. Dean yells and Missy clinks the teaspoon on her glass causing Chris to sink back into the dark void again.Meanwhile, Rod keeps trying to call Chris, but it keeps going straight to voicemail. He looks up the picture of the guy in the photo and sees that he went missing some time ago, so he goes to the police. He tells a female officer that his boy was kidnapped by white folk to be a sex slave just like the missing guy in the picture. She calls in two more officers to listen to Rod's story. When he finishes, they all burst out laughing. Nobody will take him seriously.Chris wakes up to find himself strapped to a chair in front of a mounted deer head and an old TV set. He watches a video made by Dean's father that talks about immortality, etc. Chris sees that his fingernails have clawed through the leather arm of the chair and exposed the padding. The teacup and spoon appear on the screen again. TING TING TING and he's out.Rod tries Chris's phone again and Rose answers. She lies by saying that Chris left two days ago and she's concerned about his whereabouts too. She claims that he left in a taxi or maybe an Uber. Rod tells her that he went to the police and she seems concerned. He starts to realize that something is wrong, so he tries to record the call, but when he starts talking to her again, she tells him she knows he has the hots for her. He tells her she's a crazy bitch and hangs up.Chris wakes up and Jim Hudson is on the screen. He tells Chris that they're going to swap brains. The other people at the party were all about being black, but Jim couldn't give less of a shit about that; what he really wants is to be able to see the world through Chris's eyes. Dean has perfected the neurosurgery to make this all possible. And Missy hypnotizes the body donors to prep them for the procedure. He will continue existing in the dark void, but will be able to continue on as sort of a ""passenger."" The flashing is an unfortunate side effect as they saw earlier at the party. TING TING TING of the teaspoon and Chris is out again.Dean and Jeremy prep Jim Hudson for a brain transplant. Dean tells Jeremy to go get Chris. Jeremy goes down the hall -- we see now they were in the basement of the house -- and finds Chris unconscious. He takes off his restraints and gets an I.V. ready. Chris wasn't unconscious after all -- he'd stuffed padding from the chair in his ears to block the sound of the teaspoon. He knocks out Jeremy.Dean calls for Jeremy and goes out of the lab area to look for him. Chris rushes him and impales him with the deer antlers from the other room. He knocks over a candle that ignites the blanket covering Jim Hudson too.Rose has earbuds in and isn't aware any of this is going on. While she listens to music, she is googling images of handsome-looking black men with good physiques.Chris goes upstairs and finds Missy. She goes for the teacup and spoon, but Chris beats her to them and smashes the cup. Instead she attacks him with a knife, but he turns it on her and stabs her to death. Chris goes for the front door again, but Jeremy has returned and puts him in a choke hold. Twice Chris struggles to pull open the front door, but Jeremy kicks it shut. On the third try, as Jeremy kicks the door, Chris stabs him in the leg and breaks his skull with brutal head stomps. He runs outside and gets into Jeremy's car. On the passenger seat is the medieval helmet from earlier. He starts down the driveway but hits Georgina. He can't just let her lie there like he did his mom, so he gets her in the car and continues down the driveway. She wakes up and attacks him. In the process her wig falls off and we see she has a scar across her head from a brain transplant too. They crash into a tree and she dies. Rose hears this through her earbuds.Suddenly, the rear view mirror is blown away. Rose is coming after Chris with a rifle. He begs her to stop, but she sees Georgina and refers to her as 'grandma.' Rose shoots again and misses Chris. From out of nowhere, Walter runs past Rose in pursuit of Chris, and Rose says, ""Get him, Grandpa"" as he tackles Chris. They wrestle on the ground, and Chris takes his picture. Flash! Walter turns and asks Rose for her rifle. She gives it to him, and he shoots her in the stomach, before turning the rifle on himself.Rose is on the ground bleeding out. She tries to reach for the rifle, but Chris bats it away. As he bends over her, Rose puts a hand on his cheek and tells Chris that she loves him. Chris starts to choke Rose, but stops; he can't go through with it.A police car pulls up. Rose calls weakly for help, knowing the local police will throw Chris in jail. But it's Rod stepping out of the police car. Chris gets into the car. Rod looks at the chaos and says, ""Man, I told you not to go in that house."" When Chris asks Rod how he found him, Rod explains that he works for the TSA and that everything will be alright. Rose smiles with her last breath as Rod and Chris drive away into the night. The film ends with Rod driving Chris away from the scene as Rose lies dead in the road."
The Lego Batman Movie,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4116284/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick. There are big changes brewing in Gotham City, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker's hostile takeover, Batman may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up. Bruce Wayne(Batman) is scared of having a family and he has to deal with it when he accidentally adopted Dick Grayson (Robin). After The Joker gets sent to the Phantom Zone, Batman soon finds out it was The Joker's plan to get sent there and get all the villains in there out. It is Batman and his friend's job to stop The Joker. After his appearance in The LEGO Movie, Batman now gets his own movie. We see his background, his alter-ego as Bruce Wayne and his lair. We learn how Robin got to be his sidekick. Most importantly we see his seemingly-interminable struggles with his arch-nemesis, The Joker.—grantss In the irreverent spirit of fun that made The LEGO® Movie a worldwide phenomenon, the self-described leading man of that ensemble - LEGO Batman - stars in his own big-screen adventure. But there are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if he wants to save the city from The Joker's hostile takeover, Batman may have to drop the lone-vigilante thing, try to work with others and maybe, just maybe, learn to lighten up. Over Gotham City airspace, two best friend pilots are transporting an insane amount of explosives. They are hijacked by The Joker (voice of Zach Galifianakis) and his minions. Across the city, Joker has set loose some of Gotham's most notorious criminals, including Harley Quinn (voice of Jenny Slate), Two-Face (voice of Billy Dee Williams), The Riddler (voice of Conan O'Brien), Scarecrow (voice of Jason Mantzoukas), Catwoman (voice of Zoe Kravitz), Poison Ivy (voice of Riki Lindhome), Clayface (voice of Kate Miccuci), Bane (voice of Doug Benson), Mr. Freeze, The Penguin, and some C-list villains like Calendar Man, Gentleman Ghost, and Condiment King. The pilot knows Batman (voice Will Arnett) will stop Joker, but he believes otherwise.Beneath the city's central core, Joker has Killer Croc plant a bomb that would level Gotham and plunge it into an abyss. Commissioner Jim Gordon (voice of Hector Elizondo) tries to use the Bat-signal to contact Batman, but Eggman has egged it down. Jim and Chief O'Hara go downtown to spring into action while the villains continue to run amok. Jim meets with Mayor McCaskill (voice of Mariah Carey) before she is airlifted to the central core. Joker and his villains are all gathered to watch the city be destroyed, but the Mayor reveals herself to be Batman in disguise. He proceeds to single-handedly beat down every villain before trying to catch The Joker. Batman latches onto Joker with his grappling hook but Joker reminds him that the bomb is still active. When Joker calls himself Batman's worst enemy, Batman rebuffs it by stating that Joker means nothing to him, and that nobody does. Joker looks heartbroken as Batman rushes to stop the bomb. He succeeds, and the city cheers Batman on.Batman returns to his home on his own island. He spends his free time alone in the Batcave, eating leftover lobster thermidor and cackling maniacally during ""Jerry Maguire"". Batman later stares at a portrait of himself as a child with his parents on the night they died. He starts addressing the portrait and says his parents would have been proud that he saved the city again. He is then startled by Alfred (voice of Ralph Fiennes), so Batman accidentally dropkicks him into the piano. After apologizing, Alfred realizes that Batman is going through another one of his phases and is just sad at the prospect of having another family. Alfred then reminds Batman that there is a gala later that day for Jim Gordon's retirement, which Batman reluctantly goes to.On the way to the gala, Batman (now out of disguise as Bruce Wayne) watches a news report on how Superman (voice of Channing Tatum) sent General Zod into the Phantom Zone. Joker is watching the same report in his lair with Harley and sees certain famous villains beyond the realm of Gotham City are contained there. Thus, Joker hatches his latest idea.At the gala, Bruce is approached by an orphan, Dick Grayson (voice of Michael Cera). He's a sweet kid who longs for another family. Dick asks Bruce if he would consider adopting him, just as Bruce's attention is caught by the new commissioner, Jim's daughter Barbara (Rosario Dawson). She gets up to talk to the citizens of Gotham about her latest idea: she wants the police force to team up with Batman because on his own, he hasn't done much to take care of the huge crime problem in the city. Bruce does not like the idea one bit, and moments later, the gala is interrupted by Joker and his villain team. Bruce goes into Batman mode and Master-Builds himself a vehicle while Barbara attempts to confront Joker on her own terms. To everyone's surprise, Joker surrenders himself and all the villains (except Harley) to the police. With Gotham's worst all locked up, Barbara receives credit while Batman is left to go home in disbelief.Batman stalks Arkham Asylum for any suspicious activity. He sees a van driven by Harley (now out of disguise as Harleen Quinzel) with the logo ""Phantom's Own Laundry Service"". He knows something suspicious is going on, but Barbara sees him and tells him to let the police worry about it.Back at Wayne Manor, Batman tries to access Joker's plans through the computer, but Alfred put a parental lock on the computer. He tells Batman that he should spend time with Dick, whom he had adopted over a week ago. Batman is baffled and refuses to do anything with the boy until Alfred purposely leads Dick into the Batcave. Dick is amazed to know that Batman is one of his new dads. Meanwhile, Batman schemes to put Joker in the Phantom Zone, but he must steal the Phantom Zone Projector, which is located in Superman's Fortress of Solitude. When the computer determines that Batman is way too ""jacked"" to fit into the vents that would take him to the Projector's location, he gets the idea to have Dick join him so that he can fetch it. Dick goes through Batman's costumes for a cool outfit to wear, and he settles on Batman's ""Reggae Man"" outfit and names himself Robin.The Dynamic Duo arrive at the Fortress of Solitude. While Robin goes to find the Projector, Batman creates a diversion by knocking on Superman's door. To Batman's surprise, Superman and the rest of the Justice League - including Green Lantern (voice of Jonah Hill), Flash (voice of Adam Devine), Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and the Wonder Twins - are celebrating an anniversary party without having invited Batman. A dejected Batman leaves when nobody is looking just as Robin has gotten through the complicated security system to retrieve the Projector. Batman almost admits that he's proud of Robin, but he's also too proud to admit it.Batman and Robin head on down to Arkham to take on Joker. Barbara finds them and has them go through security. When Robin is caught trying to smuggle the Projector, the two beat up the guards and run to Joker's cell. Just as he expected, Batman confronts Joker and hits him with the Projector, sending him into the Phantom Zone.In the Phantom Zone, Joker is met by a sentient brick called Phyllis (voice of Ellie Kemper). After scanning Joker for badness, she has him meet some of the most notorious villains of all time, like Lord Voldemort (voice of Eddie Izzard), Sauron (voice of Jemaine Clement), King Kong (voice of Seth Green), The Kraken, Jaws, Agent Smith, Dracula, Medusa, The Wicked Witch of the West, the Gremlins, and the Daleks. He tells the villains that he has a plan to get them all out of there. Back in Arkham, Harley steals the Projector and uses it to bring back every last villain. Joker unleashes them all on the city to cause mass mayhem. Sauron floods the streets with lava, Voldemort turns people into animals, and King Kong smashes through the city.Batman (who got himself and Robin locked up) asks Barbara to let him go so that he can go save the city. She agrees only on the condition that he allow her to join and help. Batman begrudgingly agrees, and he is now joined by Barbara, Robin, and Alfred (who somehow made it from Wayne Manor to Arkham on his own). The heroes take the Batwing across the city as they try to locate Joker. Sauron has his eye locked on Batman and has led Joker to Wayne Manor, where Joker finds Batman's stash of romantic comedies.The Gremlins start tearing into the Batwing, leading Batman to hop outside and leave the Batwing on autopilot with some rope tied to the controls. Robin and Alfred join him in taking out the Gremlins. Robin falls off the Batwing, and Batman jumps to rescue him. Alfred falls off too and nearly plummets to his death, but Barbara takes control of the Batwing and saves him. Batman then comes up with a plan and has Barbara fly toward Sauron's eye, just as Kraken blasts a fireball at the Batwing. At the right moment, Barbara steers the Batwing away and causes Sauron to get blown to bits, meaning Joker no longer has an eye on Batman.The heroes make it to Wayne Island and applaud each other for their accomplishments. Robin takes a selfie with everyone as his new family, which then strikes a nerve with Batman. The other three go into the Batwing for more gear, but Batman locks them in there and has the computer send them to the border of Gotham City and Bludhaven so that he can protect them and fight Joker on his own.Batman finds Joker inside his home, but Batman is surrounded by all the villains, completely outnumbered. Joker only wants to hear Batman say that he hates him and considers him his worst enemy, but Batman is stubborn and refuses to acknowledge it. Joker takes the Projector and sends Batman to the Phantom Zone.Batman meets Phyllis, who scans him and determines that while he's not bad enough to be considered a villain, he has done a lot of bad things to people that care about him. Batman realizes he has been trying to protect himself from getting hurt again. He makes a deal with Phyllis to bring back all the villains if she lets him go back to Gotham.Batman's computer overrides his commands to protect him and sends Robin, Barbara, and Alfred back to the island to fight the villains. Batman is sent back as well, and he apologizes to his friends for deceiving them. He opts to get help not only from them, but from all of his enemies broken out of Arkham. He even gives Barbara her own suit, dubbing her ""Batgirl"".The team faces off against Joker's villains, with all of them being gradually sent back to the Phantom Zone. However, the bomb from earlier goes off and starts to break the city apart. Batman and his friends all form a chain link using their heads and feet to pull the city back together, along with the citizens of Gotham. It's still not enough, so Batman is forced to ask for Joker's help. Batman admits to Joker that he truly is his greatest enemy and that they need each other. Joker is touched and helps Batman pull the city back together.With the city saved, Batman must fulfill his end of the bargain and return to the Phantom Zone. He reveals himself as Bruce Wayne to Robin and finally accepts him as a son. They have a tearful hug goodbye as Batman ascends to the Phantom Zone. However, he gets blocked from going up. Phyllis appears and tells Batman that she has seen how he changed to help those that he cares about, and has decided he can stay with his friends. Batman and Joker then part ways as Joker heads off with the rest of the rogues. Batman decides to give them a 30-minute head start before he and his team go catch them.Batman and Robin are both now part of a new family. Batman hangs up the family selfie in his room. As the credits begin, Robin asks Batman if he can play a song that he's written specifically for the credits. Batman and all his friends and enemies get together to perform the song."

A man named Tim Templeton tells a story about his 7-year-old self and his parents, Ted and Janice. One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit arrives at his house in a taxi, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the day-old baby receives, not to mention suspicious when the infant acts odd around him. Soon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as ""The Boss"". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. The Boss Baby and the other infants catch Tim with the recording, and the cassette tape is terminated after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.. Seven-year-old Tim Templeton (voice of Miles Bakshi) has an active imagination. He has all the love in the world from his parents Ted and Janice (voices of Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow), who play with him in all of his adventures. Ted and Janice work at PuppyCo in the marketing department, which Tim thinks is a cool job. As Tim's adult self (voice of Tobey Maguire) narrates, things became different when Tim's parents asked him how he would feel about having a little brother. Young Tim tells them he is enough, unaware that his mother is pregnant.Within the foundations of BabyCorp, numerous babies are being born (never quite explained how) and are being processed through a conveyor belt. One small baby in particular goes through the motions, getting a fresh diaper and a pacifier. The tickle machine determines where babies are placed. If they laugh, they are sent to families. If they don't react, they are sent to management. The baby boy is pushed into management and is given his own suit, watch, and briefcase before being assigned to his cubicle.Tim anxiously looks out the window to see his parents returning in a taxi with their new baby. It's the same baby from before, The Boss Baby (voice of Alec Baldwin), strutting up to the front door with his briefcase, to Tim's bewilderment. From the moment he enters the house, Boss Baby begins to command the household. Ted and Janice are so busy trying to please Boss Baby that Tim starts to feel shut out. However, Tim seems to be the only one that finds something suspicious about Boss Baby, with his suit and briefcase standing out.Tim sneaks into Boss Baby's room that night and hears him speaking with the voice of a grown man on the phone. He appears to be conspiring with someone until Tim catches him and forces Boss Baby to admit that he can talk. Although Tim thinks he's got something on him, Boss Baby is unfazed and pulls out a file on Tim, stating he knows things like how Tim's middle name is Leslie. Boss Baby warns Tim that if he doesn't shape up, his parents can ""fire"" him.Tim sets out to prove that Boss Baby is up to no good. He spies on Boss Baby as he has a playdate with other baby associates - Jimbo (voice of David Soren), Staci (voice of ViviAnn Yee), and the Triplets (voice of Eric Bell, Jr.). Boss Baby gives a presentation about BabyCorp's enemy, PuppyCo. The CEO, Francis Francis (voice of Steve Buscemi), is set to unveil their newest puppy, which could spell trouble for babies everywhere. The other babies start to get anxious when Boss Baby starts to ask what they learned from the presentation. They put on their baby act for the parents when they come around.Tim has a tape of the babies' conversation, but the babies catch him and set off to get the tape. This leads to Tim having to evade the babies in the backyard as he tries to show the tape to his parents. Boss Baby rides a small car to get Tim while the other babies go after him. Tim traps Staci in the sandbox while Jimbo rides through a fence, and the Triplets are also stopped. Tim runs back into the house, just as the adults are walking outside to see their kids in a chaotic scene. Tim runs to his parents' office and finds Boss Baby sitting in their chair. He demands the tape or else he will harm Tim's favorite stuffed doll, Lamb-Lamb. They fight for it, and they accidentally rip Lamb-Lamb's head off. Tim gets angry and grabs Boss Baby, putting him in his walker and threatening to launch him out the window. Ted and Janice walk in and see this, causing Tim to launch the tape into the street instead. Since they think he's trying to harm his brother, Tim's parents ground him.Boss Baby goes into Tim's room as he is crying. He decides to finally explain his situation to the boy. Boss Baby gives Tim one of his pacifiers and tells him to suck on it until he finds the answers he's looking for. The two are then teleported to BabyCorp as projections, watching how everything works. Boss Baby explains how he got into management and how there have been many other great Boss Babies before him. His own boss, Big Boss Baby (voice of Edie Mirman), runs her department with an iron fist. Boss Baby aspires to be like the most famous baby, Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby, so he can get the dream promotion with his own office and personal potty. He also explains how the babies stay babies, which is by drinking a special formula that stops them from aging. When Big Boss Baby is seen demanding results from Boss Baby, he panics and snaps himself and Tim back to reality. He explains that if he doesn't succeed in his mission to bring down PuppyCo, he will get fired and be forced to live with the Templetons forever. Tim then agrees to help Boss Baby, but only so he can leave.The boys then try to pretend for their parents that they love each other and are playing together, while also working together to find info on the new puppy. Ted and Janice later invite the boys to ""Bring Your Kid To Work Day"" at PuppyCo. Once there, Ted and Janice invite Tim to spend time with them while they leave Boss Baby in the puppy pit. Tim thinks about it but decides to stay with Boss Baby so they can look for the new puppy. Tim has Boss Baby dress up as a puppy to get past security. They go into a room and find a file on the new puppy, but they must replace it with another file. It works until Boss Baby gets drool on the replacement, setting off a trap. The puppy file then turns out to be a fake. The boys are caught by Eugene (voice of Conrad Vernon), a man dressed as PuppyCo's mascot.Eugene brings the boys to meet Francis. He reveals to them that he is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby, now all grown up. As a baby, he got the promotion he wanted and was at the top of his game. But because he is lactose intolerant, the formula stopped working for him, and he was booted out of BabyCorp. Now, he plots revenge against them by creating the Forever Puppy, which will stay a cute puppy for all time, stealing all the love away from babies. The only thing Francis needs is some formula for the puppy to be created, which Eugene takes out of Tim's backpack. He then sends the boys away.Ted and Janice leave the boys with Eugene (disguised as a housekeeper) while they go with Francis to Las Vegas to unveil the Forever Puppy. Without the formula, Boss Baby starts acting like a real baby. Tim and Boss Baby come up with a plan to escape Eugene by faking Boss Baby being sick and spewing fake vomit all over Eugene. The boys then ride away on Tim's bike, while Eugene chases them on a wagon. Boss Baby calls Staci and has her round up Jimbo and the Triplets to help the boys. Together, they get Tim and Boss Baby to the airport while stopping Eugene. Unfortunately, the plane for Vegas takes off before the boys can stop their parents. They then argue with both throwing the blame on one another, with Tim blaming Boss Baby for being a normal baby at the worst moment, while Boss Baby argues that they would have gotten there faster if Tim could ride a bike without training wheels. Tim tells him he knows nothing about having a real family, leading to Boss Baby ditching Tim and leaving him alone at the airport.Hours later, Boss Baby calls Tim on a phone right next to him. They reconcile and resolve to work together to get to Vegas themselves since they now know they need each other. The boys follow Elvis impersonators for a convention to Vegas, unaware that Eugene is following them as well.On the plane ride to Vegas, Tim pretends that he and Boss Baby are the captain's kids to get special perks. He shows Boss Baby how to have fun by engaging in a playtime scenario where they are pirates hijacking a ship. Boss Baby really gets into it and has actual fun for the first time in his life.The boys make it to Vegas and arrive at the convention center for the unveiling. Francis reveals the Forever Puppy to the public with Ted and Janice helping him. When the boys reveal themselves, Francis locks Ted and Janice inside a giant heart and wheels them away. Eugene tries to get the boys as they run after Francis, who is set to literally launch the Forever Puppies with a rocket. Eugene runs through a set of tubes to get to the boys, but they outsmart him and cause him to fall into a giant litter box to get scratched up by cats. The boys catch up to Francis, who tries to throw them over the ledge. Tim and Boss Baby re-enact their pirate game and throw Francis into a vat of formula. They rush to save their parents and get the puppies out of the rocket. Boss Baby then becomes a normal baby and is stuck up on the rocket until Tim sings Paul McCartney's ""Blackbird"" too get the baby down. Tim then protects his brother as the empty rocket launches.Tim runs to the formula vat and gives Boss Baby some of it to bring him back to normal. Francis then emerges from the vat, now reverted back to Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby. He threatens the boys until Eugene picks him up and gives him a pacifier. Eugene tells the boys that he will raise Francis the right way this time.The boys go home, and Boss Baby is able to leave to get his promotion. The other babies from BabyCorp wipe Ted and Janice's memories of the baby and remove any evidence that he was there, but Tim chooses not to forget him. Boss Baby returns to work as a hero and he gets his promotion like he wanted. However, both boys miss one another and don't feel happy even though they got what they wanted.Tim writes a letter to Boss Baby and sends him some of his toys. Boss Baby gets excited and he runs into the main room to play with the computer and basically quit. He goes through the conveyor belt and has himself sent down the ""family"" chute.Sometime later, Boss Baby returns to the family as a normal baby, now named Theodore Lindsay Templeton. Tim is excited to see him, as the baby appears to remember him. He runs up and grabs his new baby brother. The two then go on to have many adventures.We jump to the future with Adult Tim having been telling the whole story to his daughter, who is about to meet her own baby sister. With them is Adult Ted, still having a nice brotherly bond with Tim. Tim's daughter looks in the delivery room and sees her baby sister. To her surprise, the baby rises from her bed and is wearing a suit."
The Greatest Showman,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1485796/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Celebrates the birth of show business and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation. Orphaned, penniless, but ambitious and with a mind crammed with imagination and fresh ideas, the American entertainer, Phineas Taylor Barnum, will always be remembered as the man with the gift to blur the line between reality and fiction. Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor manages to open a wax museum; however, he soon shifts focus to the unique and the peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Now, some people call Barnum's rich collection of oddities, an outright freak show; but, when Phineas, obsessed for cheers and respectability, gambles everything on the opera singer, Jenny Lind, to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will lose sight of the most crucial aspect of his life: his family. Will Barnum, the greatest showman, risk it all to be accepted?—Nick Riganas In the late 19th century, P. T. Barnum and his troupe perform a show at the circus (""The Greatest Show""). In a flashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work for the Hallett family, he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity. Charity explains that her father is sending her to finishing school, and she does not know what her future will be, but Barnum explains that he expects great things from his future, and reassures her that they will not be separated. The two keep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood (""A Million Dreams""), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City (""A Million Dreams"" reprise). They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more. The film opens with Phineas Taylor ""P.T."" Barnum (Hugh Jackman) joining his circus troupe in a song (""The Greatest Show""), playing to an enthusiastic crowd as he and his performers put on a dazzling show.We cut to Barnum as a young boy (Ellis Rubin) in the 1800's, working with his tailor father Philo (Will Swenson). They arrive at the home of Mr. Hallett (Fred Lehne) and his daughter Charity (Skylar Dunn). P.T. makes Charity laugh and spit out her tea, prompting her father to smack him across the face and forbid him from going near her. Regardless, P.T. and Charity spend time together and develop a close friendship in song (""A Million Dreams""), even as Charity is forced to go to a finishing school. They write letters to each other and eventually reunite as adults, where Barnum proposes to Charity (now played by Michelle Williams).Barnum works for a trading company until his boss tells everyone that they are shutting the company down due to bankruptcy after their trading vessels have sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Barnum goes home to Charity and their daughters Caroline (Austyn Johnson) and Helen (Cameron Seely). He brings home a spinning lamp, or ""wishing machine"", for Caroline's birthday. Charity and the girls all make wishes, and Barnum hatches an idea.Barnum goes to the bank for a $10,000 loan and uses the deed to the (sunken) trading vessels as collateral. With the money, he opens up a museum devoted to oddities, because he thinks people are fascinated with things like that. The museum fails to attract business, and most people reject the idea.Barnum then goes around town searching for unique individuals. Among them are a dwarf named Charles Stratton (Sam Humphrey), a bearded woman named Lettie Lutz (Keala Settle), an obese man called Lord of Leeds (Daniel Everidge), a hair-covered man referred to as Dog Boy (Luciano Acuna, Jr.), and an 8-foot tall man. Although initially viewed as freaks, Barnum manages to get them all to put on a musical number of shows that win over crowds every night (""Come Alive""). One who remains unimpressed is critic James Gordon Bennett (Paul Sparks). Despite his lack of interest in Barnum's show, Bennett inspires him to rename his show as ""P.T. Barnum's Circus"".The circus starts to bring in healthy profits, leading Barnum to move his family into a luxurious mansion, as well as being able to put Caroline in a ballet school. However, she becomes discouraged when the other girls mock her for being part of a circus family.Barnum later meets a playwright named Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron). He approaches Philip with the opportunity to join his circus (""The Other Side""), and Phillip agrees on the condition that he get 10% of the profits.The troupe is invited to England to meet Queen Victoria (Gayle Rankin). She notes that Charles (now going as General Tom Thumb) is exceptionally short, and he makes a crack that she's not so tall either. After an awkward silence, Victoria lets out a hearty laugh. Later, Barnum and Phillip meet noted opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson), and they invite her to perform for the show so that she may become known worldwide.Jenny joins the show back in the States. She performs before a large crowd (""Never Enough"") that includes Phillip's parents, as well as Charity's. The crowd loves her, and Barnum even spots Bennett in the audience appearing to enjoy her. He finds himself falling for the show's trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). After Jenny's performance, Barnum and the others gather with a party, but when the rest of the troupe wants to join the party, Barnum turns them away. Although sad at first, the troupe decides not to let this get them down, as they decide to embrace who they are, regardless of how they are viewed (""This is Me"").Phillip tries to introduce Anne to his parents, but they disapprove of her because of her race. She leaves upset, and Phillip tells his parents off for how they spoke to Anne. He goes to find her, and they express their mutual feelings for one another (""Rewrite The Stars"").Barnum goes on tour with Jenny, leaving Phillip as the ringmaster with the show. Protesters continuously gather outside to harass the troupe for their physical differences. The distance proves to be hard for Charity and the girls (""Tightrope""). While celebrating their success so far, Jenny appears to develop an attraction to Barnum, but he remains faithful to Charity. Jenny gets upset and threatens to quit, but Barnum has her finish the tour. After one performance, the press snaps a photo of Jenny kissing Barnum before she ultimately quits.Phillip confronts the protesters, but they refuse to leave. When they threaten him and the others, Anne's brother W.D. (Yahya Abdul-Mateen III) throws the first punch, leading to an all-out brawl between the troupe and the protesters. One of the protesters grabs a lantern and throws it at a wall, setting the theater ablaze. Barnum returns home from his tour and greets his family when he overhears about the fire. He runs toward it just as the flames consume the whole building. Phillip runs inside to find Anne, but she is already coming out with W.D. Barnum runs in for Phillip, just as the building collapses. His daughters cry, thinking him dead, until he emerges with an unconscious Phillip. He is taken to the hospital.Barnum just sits outside the remains of the theater. Bennett goes to join him, saying that the police arrested the thugs that started the fire, and while Bennett didn't enjoy Barnum's show, he feels that another critic may have called it a ""celebration of humanity"". He then shows Barnum the newspaper, which shows Jenny kissing him and her announcement of quitting. Barnum rushes home to Charity, only to find that she's packed her bags because the bank is evicting them, but she is also unhappy over seeing the paper, despite Barnum trying to explain himself.Barnum goes to drink at a bar. The entire troupe finds him and confronts him. Lettie tells Barnum that while he may not have always done the right thing, he saw them all as more than freaks and gave them a real family and home. Barnum is encouraged to pick himself up and help get the troupe back to performing (""From Now On""). He then runs to Charity's childhood home where the girls tell him that she's at the beach. Barnum goes to apologize to her for being obsessed with chasing fame, and she says all she wanted was the man she fell in love with.Phillip, who has recovered, offers to provide his shares from profits to restart the circus. Although Barnum hesitates, Phillip is adamant in being his partner with 50% of shares. Barnum restarts the show in a tent with circus animals and the rest of the troupe. Audiences turn out in droves. Barnum then decides to hand over the job of ringmaster to Phillip so that he can go and watch his girls grow up. Phillip finishes the show and kisses Anne, while Barnum rides an elephant to meet Charity and the girls.The film ends with Barnum and Charity watching Caroline perform in the ballet (with Helen playing a tree), and Barnum acknowledging that everything he ever wanted and needed is right in front of him."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790809/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Captain Jack Sparrow is pursued by old rival Captain Salazar and a crew of deadly ghosts who have escaped from the Devil's Triangle. They're determined to kill every pirate at sea...notably Jack. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis, the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.—ahmetkozan Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), a deadly ghost escapes the Devil's triangle with his crew and is taking over the seas in search of his arch-rival and author of all his pain, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). In the meantime, Jack is approached by a boy who needs to locate the Trident of Poseidon, something he believes only Sparrow can help him find. Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) an astronomer and horologist joins the team to help them find something she believes her father had always wanted her to find. Jack's only hope is to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon, who's master gets control of all the seas, or so it's said.—Viir khubchandani Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp's) luck has run out. Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) has released the most deadly ghost pirates of the sea from the Devil's Triangle. Captain Salazar is the oldest villain of Jack Sparrow. The ghost pirates hunt every single pirate at sea, including Jack Sparrow. The only hope to survive this adventure is to collect the legendary Trident of Poseidon. This weapon is the most powerful weapon and the owner gets control of all seas. Is Jack going to collect this powerful weapon and can he ensure he is not going to get killed by Captain Salazar and his pirate ghosts?—M.W.A. Haertel In the opening scene, young Henry Turner (Lewis McGowan) leaves his home in the dark of night to take a rowboat out to the middle of the ocean. He finds himself pulled down to the bottom of the sea and inside the cursed ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman. Henry finds his father, Will (Orlando Bloom), still cursed as captain of the Dutchman. Henry wants to break his father's curse using the fabled Trident of Poseidon and he thinks he can get it with the help of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), but Will thinks it's a lost cause and urges his son to stop his quest. He sends Henry back up to his boat.Nine years later, Henry (now played by Brenton Thwaites) is a member aboard a British Royal Navy ship, the Monarch. He realizes that the ship is headed toward the Devil's Triangle, a dangerous place in the Atlantic Ocean where ships are not meant to sail. Henry rushes to warn the captain of their course, but is charged with insubordination and is locked up in the ship's brig.Sure enough, the warship passes through the rocky walls that lead into the Devil's Triangle. They are soon attacked by the undead pirates of the Silent Mary. The ghost pirates slay the soldiers one by one. Boarding the warship is Captain Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem). He makes his way down to the brig and sees a wanted poster for Jack Sparrow. Salazar finds Henry's cell and orders the boy to send a message to Jack that Salazar will be coming for him.On the island of St. Martin, a young woman named Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) is locked up in a cell after being accused of witchcraft. In reality, she is just very knowledgeable in astronomy and horology. While speaking to a guard, she manages to pick her lock and escape.Meanwhile on the island, Jack has broken into a bank vault and is found sleeping in it. His crew hooks up the whole bank to a bunch of horses and has them pull it through the streets. They make it back to Jack's new ship, the Dying Gull, which is strapped to a small shack by the shore. When the crew brings the vault onto the ship, they find the whole thing empty, save for a single coin (which Jack nabs for himself, naturally). The crew has become frustrated with how Jack has been leading them. Even Mr. Gibbs (Kevin McNally) has lost faith in old Jack. They all turn their backs on him and leave him alone.Henry is still a prisoner of the British Royal Navy, and is now set to be executed for treason, but he is surprised to find Carina having disguised herself to find Henry personally. She wants to help Henry find the Trident of Poseidon and can do so with the help of a diary she has in her possession that has a map to the Trident, and the map only came into view during a blood moon with the help of a red jewel that she has been carrying.Jack goes to trade his magic compass (the one that points the holder to what they desire) for (what else) a bottle of rum. Once the transaction is made, it causes Salazar and his crew to be released from the Devil's Triangle, allowing them to roam the seas and seek out Jack.Carina helps Henry escape, but she and Jack end up captured. While in his cell, Jack meets Henry and learns he is the son of the late Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Henry turns out to be disappointed when he finds Jack, seeing him as a disgraced drunk locked up in a cell. He tells Jack how he plans to break his father's curse.Jack and Carina are brought to the gallows for their execution. On the way to the noose, Jack stops by a cell and finds his Uncle Jack (Paul McCartney), who has seen better days but is still content in his pirate life. Before Jack and Carina's sentences are carried out, Henry rounds up Jack's crew to help them free, even though it's only because Henry is paying them to save Jack. The pirates fight the guards and the executioner, with Carina nearly getting hung until Henry catches her. Everyone makes their way to the Dying Gull, and they manage to release it from its holdings.Somewhere else across the ocean, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is enjoying his time as the captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge after taking it from Captain Blackbeard, with his new crew helping him reap in much rewards. However, Barbossa learns that Salazar is out there. He meets with a sea witch, Shansa (Golshifteh Farahani), who has come into possession of the compass, which she hands to Barbossa.Soon, Salazar and his crew find the Queen Anne's Revenge, and Salazar meets with Barbossa after learning he has the compass. He wants him to help catch Jack. Salazar explains his fight with Jack - many years earlier, Salazar was a powerful captain of the Spanish navy who went about the seas with his men slaying every pirate they came across. They came across a young Jack, still just a crew member aboard his ship. As Salazar and his crew laid waste to Jack's crew, the young lad would quickly come into possession of the compass from one of his dying comrades. With his quick thinking, Jack tricked Salazar into sailing his ship into the Devil's Triangle. Salazar's ship and his men were destroyed, but the power of the Devil's Triangle brought them back to life as ghosts. Jack then became captain of his ship. Now Salazar wants to find the Trident to kill Jack and every last pirate out there. Barbossa agrees to help find Jack.Aboard the Gull, Jack observes the growing attraction between Henry and Carina. He puts it to the test when he threatens to throw Henry overboard. The pirates do so, but they dropped him onto a rowboat and only reveal it to Carina after she has a frightened reaction.Shortly after, the British Royal Navy show up and head toward the Gull, but they are mowed down by the Silent Mary. Salazar has his sights set on Jack, leading Jack to tell Gibbs and the rest of the crew that they are dealing with the dead. The ghost pirates attack Jack and his crew. Jack, Carina, and Henry board a rowboat while the others stay and fight. Carina hops off the rowboat and swims to the nearby island. Before Henry can go ahead and do the same, Salazar has reanimated dead sharks and sends them after Jack and his crew. Jack and Henry try to evade the sharks, and they manage to hook onto one and use it to ride their boat to the shore. Salazar and his men run after them, but they are unable to touch land without burning up in the sun. Salazar vows to wait for Jack as he and Henry head into the island.During their walk on the island, Jack is found by an old pirate comrade who claims is owed a favor from Jack. He forces Jack to wed his (repulsive) widowed sister and adopt their two children. Before the union can be made official, Barbossa shows up and unintentionally saves Jack. However, he still needs something from Jack - he wants to get the Black Pearlout of the bottle Jack has been carrying all along so that it can once again be free to sail the seas. Jack breaks the Pearl out of its bottle and has Barbossa push it into the water as it grows back to its enormous size.On the way to the Trident, Barbossa has Jack tied to the mast. He goes to talk to Carina as she looks up at the stars. Barbossa suggests that Carina's father was a thief, and she slaps him in response. She tells Barbossa how she was named after a star. After seeing the design in her diary, Barbossa figures her name is Carina. He goes back to Jack, and they both realize that Carina is Barbossa's daughter. He explains to Jack that he gave up a child for adoption a long time ago and figures this must be her. Barbossa doesn't want anyone else to know and he threatens to cut out Jack's tongue if he breathes a word.Eventually, the Pearl reaches the island containing the Trident. Carina sees the points on the island matching the design of the stars' alignment. With the red jewel, she manages to uncover the Trident's location. The sea splits in two and reveals the Trident to be located at the bottom of the sea. Just as the crew approaches the Trident, Salazar and his crew find them as well. The pirates all engage in battle, with Salazar going after Jack. Salazar grabs the Trident and tries to kill Jack with it. Henry and Carina realize that destroying the Trident breaks every curse on the sea. With the Trident pinned against Jack, Henry runs up and breaks the Trident. Salazar and his men return to their normal state. Gibbs and the others drop the anchor for Jack, Henry, Carina, and Barbossa to get back up. They grab on, but Salazar, not willing to rest until Jack is dead, follows after them with some of his men. As they reach the top, the sea starts coming together. Barbossa descends the anchor and faces Carina. He reveals a tattoo on his arm of the stars, and Carina soon realizes what it means. She asks him what she is to him. Barbossa responds, ""Treasure."" He drops with his sword and hits Salazar, sending the captain and his men to their (now permanent) deaths, at the cost of Barbossa's own life. Once the other three make it back to the ship, the crew mourns Barbossa.Henry and Carina are standing on a hill. They give in to their attraction and they kiss. She has also decided to take on the Barbossa name. Henry looks through a telescope and sees the Flying Dutchman surface. Will walks to the shore, now a free man at last. He approaches Henry and sees his necklace, knowing it belongs to his son. Will embraces Henry, who promises to tell him the story of how he freed him. They are soon joined by Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who runs up to Will and kisses him.Jack is once again captain of the Black Pearl, and the crew is ready to follow him once again. They set sail on their next adventure.After the credits, Will is sleeping in bed with Elizabeth. The door opens and a shadowy figure slowly walks in. We then see the claw of DAVY JONES!!! Will wakes up startled. He holds Elizabeth close, thinking it was a nightmare. He is unaware that there is a trace of Jones (wet barnacles) on the floor beneath them."
Kong: Skull Island,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3731562/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists explores an uncharted island in the Pacific, venturing into the domain of the mighty Kong and must fight to escape a primal Eden. A washed up monster chaser convinces the U.S. Government to fund a trip to an unexplored island in the South Pacific. Under the guise of geological research, the team travels to ""Skull Island"". Upon arrival, the group discover that their mission may be complicated by the wildlife which inhabits the island. The beautiful vistas and deadly creatures create a visually stunning experience that is sure to keep your attention.—Jason Burns When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa and his partner Houston Brooks from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis. He hires the former Captain James Conrad to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard; and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver. On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow, a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Defying discovery, the notorious Skull Island, a small uncharted haven in the South Pacific encircled by a perpetual storm system, harbours a uniquely complex and self-contained ecosystem. With the intention of making ground-breaking discoveries but utterly clueless of what they would find there, an exploration and research team led by scientist Bill Randa will boldly go where no man has ever gone before, completely cut-off from civilisation. But, soon, as strange and reason-defying encounters with magnificent, yet unclassified species start to baffle the esteemed scientists, one thing will become quite clear: apparently, we humans, never owned this blue planet.—Nick Riganas In 1944, two World War II fighter pilots, American pilot Hank Marlow and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari, parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight and engage in close combat, but the fight is interrupted by a giant ape. In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as Skull Island. They are escorted by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates. The group is joined by anti-war photographer Mason Weaver, who believes that the expedition is a secret military operation, and intends to expose it.. In the year 1944, somewhere over the South Pacific, Lieutenant Hank Marlow (Will Brittain) lands with his parachute on an island after his plane crashes. Another soldier, Gunpei Ikari (Miyavi), lands. Marlow draws his gun on Ikari and shoots but misses. Ikari takes out his gun and chases after Marlow. They run into the forest and fight when they go by a cliff. Ikari nearly impales Marlow with his sword, but Marlow pulls it away. Ikari then has Marlow on the ground and nearly kills him before a gigantic ape hand appears. The two men then see the ape (Terry Notary) rise above them.In 1973, in Washington D.C., government official Bill Randa (John Goodman) and geologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) arrive to meet with Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins) to receive funding for an expedition to a recently discovered location called Skull Island. Willis isn't too keen on the idea, but Randa goads him into relenting. Before leaving, Randa tells Willis he also would like a military escort.The Sky Devils squadron are gathered on their last day before they can finally go home. Led by Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), they include Captain Earl Cole (Shea Whigham), Slivko (Thomas Mann), Reles (Eugene Cordero), Glenn Mills (Jason Mitchell), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell), who is Packard's right-hand man. Packard receives the call for the expedition and gladly accepts the job.Randa and Brooks go to a bar and find a former British Special Air Service captain named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to be their tracker. Conrad is confronted by two bar patrons who believe he cheated in a game of pool, but he easily subdues the men. Randa is immediately impressed, telling Brooks they've found their guide. Conrad sits with Randa and Brooks to hear their plan. When he hears their offer, he demands more money and points out that there's a good chance that the trip will get them killed for reasons involving severe weather conditions or predatory creatures.Inside a darkroom, anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) is developing some photos she took of the conflict in Vietnam. She gets a call to join the expedition and she arrives at the base to meet with Packard and his men, plus a team of scientists from the company Landsat, including Brooks' fellow geologist San Lin (Tian Jing) and Landsat employees Victor Nieves (John Ortiz) and Steve (Marc Evan Jackson). Weaver has reservations about the mission and thinks the military is planning something bad. Brooks goes over the mission and what they hope to find on Skull Island.The team sails into the ocean before taking choppers to the island. They must pass through clouds that produce hurricane-like conditions but are able to find a high-pressure pocket that they believe will be a safer route. After a turbulent ride through the storm, the choppers fly across the area. Weaver takes some pictures while the soldiers begin dropping seismic charges into the ground, setting off explosions. Almost immediately, a tree is thrown through one of the choppers, sending it crashing to the ground. The team then sees Kong towering over them. He sends another tree through a chopper before grabbing a few more and smashing them into the ground. The surviving team members are separated once they hit the ground. Amidst the flames burning from the remains of the choppers, Packard stares up at Kong, who looks down back at him.Packard confronts Randa at gunpoint and demands to know what really brought them there. Randa admits that he had known about the existence of monsters like Kong for a while, and he is seeking proof for his organization, Monarch.Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, Lin, Slivko, and Nieves are grouped together while Randa, Packard, Mills, Cole, and other soldiers set out to look for Chapman, as he is equipped with enough ammunition that Packard intends to use against Kong. As the soldiers walk through a bamboo forest forest, one soldier suddenly stops, a bamboo tree has impaled him through the mouth. Above them is a giant spider that starts attacking them. Mills is pulled up by the webbing, and the rest of the soldiers start cutting its legs off. Mills cuts himself loose, and Packard shoots the spider to death.Chapman is by himself near a river. He sees Kong walking through the river to tend to a wound he sustained from the choppers' gunfire. Kong drinks from the river and then finds a giant octopus. He tangles with it, fighting off its tentacles before he starts to eat it. He then drags the octopus carcass away.Conrad's group is cornered by a tribe of natives. As they try to defend themselves, out comes an older Marlow (now played byJohn C. Reilly). He assures both groups that they are not harmful to each other and then invites the group past the wall. Marlow explains to the group that he's been there for the last 28 years and has learned a lot about the natives and the island itself. Kong is like a god to them, as he has been protecting them from the creatures that dwell beneath the earth and have been killing off the natives for centuries, as well as Kong's own family. Marlow calls them ""Skull Crawlers"". They stayed underground until the explosions from the seismic charges woke them up. If anything happens to Kong, the Skull Crawlers will dominate the island. He also suggests that the Skull Crawlers that have come to the surface are just juveniles and that a much larger one exists.Still alone, Chapman walks through the forest and sits on a log. The log turns out to be a giant insect. Chapman shoots at it, but the creature does not retaliate. As the creature leaves, Chapman is killed by a Skull Crawler.Conrad tells Marlow that they plan to make it to their rendezvous point on the north side of the island within three days so that they may be rescued. Marlow says that it cannot be done in three days on foot, so he agrees to guide them the right way. He bids the natives farewell and takes the crew on a boat. Shortly after riding away, Nieves is snatched up by carnivorous birds and torn apart midair.Along the way, Weaver sees a huge water buffalo stuck under a crashed chopper. She tries lifting it up to free the buffalo, only for Kong to show up and pull the chopper off. He stares down at Weaver briefly and leaves. She appears more awed by him than terrified.Marlow leads the group into The Forbidden Zone, which is a former battleground between Kong's ancestors and the Skull Crawlers. The enormous remains of Kong's family lie among the field. A Skull Crawler appears, forcing the group to hide. The Skull Crawler then spits out Chapman's skull and dog tags, which Conrad notices. Packard and his men come around the same area. Randa is taking pictures and is then snatched up and eaten by a Skull Crawler. Another beast shows up and starts to attack and pull victims in with its tongue. The groups continue their battle with the Skull Crawlers plus a wave of the carnivorous birds. Marlow takes out the sword that belonged to Ikari and slashes through several of the birds before handing it over to Conrad. Weaver kills one by tossing a lighter into a hole that produces fumes, which are ignited and set the creature on fire.After the fight, they regroup. Packard is still set on looking for Chapman. Conrad shows Packard Chapman's dog tags to confirm his demise. Still, Packard wants to look for Chapman's ammunition stash so that they can kill Kong; he is hellbent on revenge for the deaths of his men, despite the objections of Marlow, Conrad, and Weaver.That night, Packard gathers explosives and lays a trap for Kong. Meanwhile, Conrad and Weaver encounter the beast, but Weaver approaches him cautiously. She places her hand on his face and he is gentle. However, Packard lures Kong toward him and ignites the fuel along the water, singeing and burning Kong's fur. Kong stomps on Steve and kills another man in the chaos before collapsing. Packard then gets ready to set off some explosives, but Conrad and Weaver try to stop him. They convince the other soldiers that they need Kong to keep the Skull Crawlers out. The soldiers turn on Packard, who remains defiant. Just then, the biggest Skull Crawler bursts out of the ground, forcing the group to run. Packard stays behind to detonate the explosives, but Kong crushes him under his fist.The survivors then head toward the shore as the main Skull Crawler pursues them. Cole stays behind to sacrifice himself with the explosive devices he has strapped to himself. However, the monster tail-whips Cole into a wall and he blows up anyway. The Skull Crawler heads toward the group until Kong returns and smashes into the beast. Kong uses a ship's propeller attached to a length of anchor chain to would the beast, finally slashing it on the throat. The best isn't dead and attacks again. Weaver takes a flare gun and hits the Skull Crawler in the face with it. Kong grabs the Skull Crawler and hurls him into the wall, accidentally knocking Weaver into the river. Kong pulls Weaver out and still fights the Skull Crawler. He rams his fist down the monster's throat and pulls out its guts. Kong then places Weaver down next to Conrad before leaving.Shortly after, the survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Marlow, Brooks, Lin, Mills, Slivko, and Reles) depart on the boat, and three choppers show up to get them. In the distance, Kong keeps a lookout to continue protecting his territory. He pounds his fist and lets out a roar.As the credits begin, we see video footage of Marlow finally returning home to Chicago where he sees his wife again and finally meets his adult son. He then sits down to watch a Cubs game with a hot dog and a beer.After the credits, Conrad and Weaver are being held in an interrogation room by Monarch. Entering the room are Brooks and Lin, who tell the two that Kong was never the only monster out there and that this world did not always belong to humankind. Brooks pulls out some files, including a map of Tokyo, before putting on a slideshow. The slides show another crew coming across cave drawings of other monsters - Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan and Godzilla himself. The last thing we hear are the combined roars of Kong and Godzilla."
Cars 3,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3606752/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Lightning McQueen sets out to prove to a new generation of racers that he's still the best race car in the world. Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves. To get back in the game, he will need the help of an eager young race technician with her own plan to win, inspiration from the late Fabulous Hudson Hornet, and a few unexpected turns. Proving that #95 isn't through yet will test the heart of a champion on Piston Cup Racing's biggest stage!—Pixar Racing is starting to become tough for Lightning McQueen, as he is becoming one of the oldest race cars on the race track and a generation of new rookies are coming into the racing world. For Lightning to prove that he is still a top racer, he is going to need help from an eager young female car named Cruz Ramirez, who is to help and train Lightning. He's not quitting until he shows he is still a top racer. Lightning McQueen is happily winning all of his races until a new generation of high-tech racers are trained. They all zoom past McQueen, leaving him fading behind. Jackson Storm, a new-gen, wins four times in a row as McQueen pushes himself too hard and crashes. In order to get back on the race track, he needs training from a young racing technician at the Rust-eze Racing Center, Cruz Ramirez. Cruz and Smokey Yunick, the former engineer for the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, help McQueen best they can. With cheering from Mater, Luigi, Guido, and Sally, McQueen could possibly beat Storm in the Florida 500 by learning a few tricks from the history of the Fabulous Hudson Hornet.—kenamwilliam After Mater's brief involvement with international espionage inCars 2 (2011), the seven-time Piston Cup champion, Lightning McQueen, finds himself struggling to keep up with young, motivated, and super-equipped next-generation rookie drivers. As the once-unbeatable racecar starts falling behind, taking increasingly dangerous risks to prove that he can still compete, McQueen needs all the help he can get. Now, there is no turning back, and fierce Cruz Ramirez, a lifelong fan of McQueen and his new coach, has her work cut out for her to help her idol prove his mettle. Is Lightning McQueen still at the top of his game and the best racing car in the world?—Nick Riganas Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is racing with his long time friends Bobby Swift and Cal Weathers (Kyle Petty). The three have mutual respect as they trade victories throughout the series. Whoever wins can count on getting pranked by the others, all in good fun. During one race, Bobby and Lightning are fighting toward the finish, when a car with a black body whizzes past them both, taking the checkered flag.Lightning watches the replay on the Jumbotron, seeing Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer) seemingly come from nowhere to beat him. Chick Hicks (Bob Peterson), Lightning's old racing opponent, is now an announcer for the Racing Sports Network. He introduces his co-host, Natalie Certain (Kerry Washington), a statistical analysis. She explains that Jackson is part of a new generation of racers who use the latest technology to run faster than the veterans. At the next race, there are six more high-tech cars, and they race with precision, cutting off Lightning at each turn. Jackson wins again, with Lightning finishing third. With Jackson piling up more wins, the announcers spend all their time talking about him, and how he trains on the latest simulators. Lightning finds out that Cal Weathers and the rest of the old racers have decided to retire or been replaced.At the next race, it's Lightning alone against all next-gen racers. After the last pit stop, Lightning has the lead, but it doesn't take long for Jackson to catch up and overtake him. Pushing himself, Lightning tries to catch up, until one of his tires blows out. Before he can react, he is skidding sideways, and then gets launched into a barrel roll. When he stops rolling, a hiss of smoke comes from his engine. A fire truck and tow truck arrive to help, looking for any signs of life.Four months later, Lightning is recovering back in Radiator Springs. He watches some old footage of his mentor, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), when he had a similar wreck. Lightning remembers his words, ""You think I quit? They quit on me. When I got put back together, I went back expecting a big welcome. You know what they said? 'You're history.' Moved right on to the next rookie in line. There was a lot left in me. I never got a chance to show 'em."" Sally (Bonnie Hunt) greets him, and he tells her he doesn't want to be forced into retiring, like Doc, but he can't keep doing the same thing that hasn't been working. She tells him to try something new, and not be afraid of failure, but of never having the chance. Lightning's best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) shows up, and Lightning tells him that he's ready to start training again. But first he needs to talk to Rusty (Tom Magliozzi) and Dusty (Ray Magliozzi), the owners of Rust-Eze, Lightning's sponsor.At Flo's V-8 Cafe, Lightning calls them and says that he wants to train like Jackson, and they say they're ahead of him, and they're opening the new Rust-eze Racing Center. Mack (John Ratzenberger) gets him into his trailer and drives him out to the center. When he arrives, Rusty and Dusty are there to greet him, and they tell him they sold Rust-eze to a car named Sterling (Nathan Fillion). He greets Lightning and shows him a wall that has all his career highlights in pictures. He tells Lightning that it's time for a new look. He gives Lightning an electronic suit that can track his speed and vital signs. Showing Lightning around, Sterling takes him to the race simulator. Sterling introduces him to his trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo). Cruz is coaching cars on treadmills, coaxing them to reach their top speed. When she sees Lightning, she calls him her senior project.Over the next few days, Cruz leads Lightning in aerobic exercises. Lightning follows along, but he just wants to try the simulator. Reluctantly, she starts it up, and Lightning drives on it, but soon he finds himself repeatedly hitting walls. Freeing himself from the treadmill's restraints, he shoots forward and crashes into the screen. After Sterling and Cruz talk about what to do, Lightning goes into his office. Sterling shows him an array of products with his face on them, saying this will be his legacy. Lightning asks what he means, and he tells him that he's not going to race him anymore. Lightning begs for one more race, and says that if he doesn't win, he'll retire and sell all the merchandise he can. Sterling agrees, and allows him to train at Fireball Beach, but only if he takes Cruz with him.Cruz tells him that his body suit will track his speed, but she has to be close behind, because it has a short range. He takes off toward a pier, with a voice announcing his speed. ""46, 63, out of range."" Lightning looks back and sees Cruz still at the start, spinning her wheels. He goes back and tells her that on the beach, she has to ease into the throttle. They try again, and this time, Cruz gets stuck in softer sand. The next time, she gets stuck in shallow waves, then she spins out and does a doughnut. Trying again, she gets buried in the sand spraying off her tires. He tells her to stick to compacted sand, and they try it again. This time, Cruz stops, not because she got stuck, but because she didn't want to hit a crab. Lightning sees that the sun is setting, so he takes her to the start for one more try. ""Now, you're gonna take off slow, to let your tires grab,"" he says, ""and pick a straight line on the sand, so you don't spin out. And all the crabbies have gone night-night."" This time, she's able to keep up, and when he finishes, she tells him his top speed was 198, still slower than Jackson. Looking at a road sign, Lightning sees Thunder Hollow, which has a dirt track. He decides he needs to do some real racing, but if the press finds out, they'd be all over him. Mack tells him that he's a master of disguise.At the speedway, Mack spins his tires in mud, covering Lightning and making him unrecognizable. Cruz joins him at the starting line to track his speed, and then they hear an announcement over the PA welcoming everyone to the Crazy Eight Demolition Derby. Lightning and Cruz try to slip out quietly, but find the gate shut. They're soon joined by Miss Fritter (Lea DeLaria), a huge school bus with chain link fencing around the outside. The derby starts, and all the other cars start crashing into each other, with Lightning and Cruz barely avoiding getting hit. Miss Fritter is about to ram Cruz, but Lightning pushes her out of the way just in time, and Miss Fritter's momentum causes her to flip on her side. Miss Fritter had grazed Lightning's tire on the way by, causing him to get stuck. She uprights herself and bears down on him. At the last second, he gets his tires to grip and speeds out of the way, making her crash. Cruz is the only undamaged car left, so she is declared the winner. A water truck comes to Miss Fritter's aid, but Cruz gets in the way, causing it to tip over and splash water everywhere. The mud on Lightning is washed away, revealing his identity to the crowd. Suddenly, cameras flash from everywhere.Cruz and Lightning are back in Mack's trailer, with Cruz next to a large trophy. She tries to hide the fact that she's giddy about having won a race. Lightning yells at her that he was supposed to get faster so he could win a real race, but he hasn't, because he had to spend the whole week taking care of her. He says that the next race is his last chance, something she wouldn't understand because she isn't a racer. She tells Mack to pull over, and then gets out of the trailer. She asks Lightning if he thinks she dreamed of becoming a trainer. She says she wanted to become a racer her whole life because of him. And then, when she got to her first race, she saw all the other cars looking bigger, stronger and more confident. She realized she didn't belong, and so she left. She asks him how he felt at his first race, and he says he never thought he couldn't do it. She says she wished she knew how that felt, and she drives off back to the center.Mack spends the night sleeping under an overpass, with Lightning watching TV in the trailer. Footage from the demolition derby gets played. Natalie reports that Jackson set a new record for the fastest lap in a race. Sterling says that Lightning will race as planned. Natalie says that Jackson is the heavy favorite to win. Lightning calls up Mater and tells him that he really wishes he could talk to Doc Hudson and get some good advice. Mater replies that nobody knew more about racing than Doc, except the truck who taught him.The next morning, Mack catches up to Cruz, and Lightning comes out. She tells him that she's resigning as his trainer, and he asks her to join him as he looks for Smokey (Chris Cooper), Doc's trainer. Arriving at Doc's hometown, they find an old racetrack and they take a lap. Smokey sees them and introduces himself, and leads them into a bar. All the old cars are talking about Doc's racing days, and Lightning says he wished he could've seen Doc so happy. Smokey and Lightning head outside, and Lightning says if he doesn't win, he'll never race again, and he doesn't want what happened to Doc to happen to him. Smokey tells him that after Doc's big wreck, he holed himself up in Radiator Springs, cutting off all contact. But one day, Smokey started getting letters from Doc, all about the young rookie that he started coaching. Rolling into Smokey's garage, Lightning finds a whole wall of pictures of himself and Doc together. Smokey tells him that racing wasn't the best part of Doc's life, coaching him was. Smokey says that Doc saw something in Lightning that he himself never saw. He asks if Lightning's ready to find it, and he says yes.Smokey says that Lightning will never be faster than Jackson, but he can be smarter. He says he heard that Lightning was in a demolition derby, but doesn't have a scratch on him. He says that's what Lightning can do when he's not overthinking. Cruz is put on a lift and given a new spoiler and racing tires, and has ""Storm 2.0"" duct taped on her sides. Since Lightning had missed qualifiers, he would be starting at the back, with Jackson at the front. Cruz and Lightning take their positions at the starting line, and Smokey tells him he has three laps to catch up to her. The first time they try, Cruz beats him easily. Trying a different approach, he has them drive on an old country road, tossing bales of hay at them along the way. One bale smacks Lightning in the face. At another session, Smokey has them in a field, and then Smokey revs his engine, startling a group of tractors and causing them to scurry in every direction. Lightning and Cruz try to duck and dodge the best they can. Repeating the racing exercise, Lightning still can't catch up to Cruz.Lightning and Cruz go to the drive-in to watch some old racing footage of Doc. He sees Doc drafting behind another car, and then pulling ahead. Smokey tells him he'll have to look for opportunities like that. When a car tries to run Doc into the wall, he drives up the wall and flips over the top of the other car, landing on the other side and taking the lead. They do the tractor drill again, and this time Lightning smoothly sails through the gaps between the tractors. Doing the hay bale drill, Lightning effortlessly dodges the bales. Smokey introduces them to the last drill, one they used when they were running moonshine. They have to drive through a forest at night with no lights on. At first, Lightning and Cruz are tentative, slowly making their way past the trees. They gain confidence and start to speed up, weaving between the trees. Brushing up against them, Lightning's body suit gets ripped off. Soon they start passing Smokey and the rest of the legends.Repeating the racing exercise one last time before the race, Lightning starts drafting behind Cruz, and then he pulls out in front of her. She takes back the lead, and he pulls ahead again. Neck and neck down the final stretch, Lightning gives it one last burst of speed and pulls in front, but then she takes the lead for good at the last second. She celebrates wildly, forgetting what it means for him. Sheepishly, he says they'd better head for the race in Florida.At the race, Lightning lines up in the last position, and then he hears Smokey's voice on his headset. The race starts, and Lightning starts passing the other racers. Cruz is also in the pits, and she reminds Lightning about the three-lap rule. Sterling rolls up to Cruz and tells her to leave, and take off the spoiler and racing tires she still had. There's a wreck on the track, and Lightning pulls into the pits, telling Smokey that he needs Cruz back. She pulls in, and he tells the crew to get her set up, since he's going to have her finish the race for him.Nervously, Cruz pulls out of the pits and joins the rest of the cars, still under caution. When the green flag comes out, Cruz tries to accelerate, but her tires don't grip at first. Lightning repeats what he told her on the beach. ""Take off slow, and let your tires grab."" She slowly accelerates, gaining speed. At the first turn, she starts to skid. ""Pick a line, so you don't spin out. All the crabbies have gone night-night."" Getting more confident, Cruz pulls up behind the pack of racers. Thinking of the tractor exercise, she picks her way between the racers, quickly moving up. In the announcers' booth, Natalie says that she doesn't have any stats on Lightning's replacement, except that she recently won a demolition derby. Steadily gaining confidence, Cruz moves into the top ten. Drafting behind another car, she swerves out and pulls in front, taking third place. Jackson lets the second place car pass him, and then pulls alongside her. He tells her that she can play dress-up all she wants, but she'll never be a racer. He puts on speed, quickly retaking the lead. Lightning tells her to believe in herself, and that she is a racer. With determination, she goes past the second car, pulling right behind Jackson. The white flag comes out, signaling the last lap.Jackson tries to throw Cruz off by swerving, but she matches his every move. Approaching the finish line, she pulls to the outside, but he rams her into the wall. Remembering what she saw Doc do, she drives up the wall and flips over Jackson, pulling ahead and taking the checkered flag. She does doughnuts in the infield as the crowd loudly chants her name. Pulling into the pits, she meets back up with Lightning. Sterling pulls up to her and tells her that she would make a great racer on his team. She tells him that she'd never race for him, and Tex Dinoco asks her if she'd like to race for him. Lightning looks at the Jumbotron and sees his name and Cruz's as the winner of the race. Sally asks him if that means he's going to keep racing, and he says he will, but there's something he needs to do first.Back at Radiator Springs, Cruz and Lightning show off their new looks. She has 51 painted on her side, Doc Hudson's old number, and he has ""The Fabulous Lightning McQueen"" painted on him. Tex Dinoco pulls up and tells them that he just bought Rust-eze, and now Lightning will be Cruz's pit chief. Driving up to Willy's Butte, they take their places at the starting line. At the drop of the flag, they take off racing, just as Lightning and Doc used to. Lightning feels that Doc is close by, and he knows he's exactly where he belongs."
War for the Planet of the Apes,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3450958/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel. After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.—ahmetkozan After being constantly attacked by the humans, despite asking for peace, Caesar and the Apes decide to find a new home safe from the humans. But after the tragic deaths of the most recent attack from the humans, Caeser embarks on a mission to kill the ruthless human Colonel.—Ronald Pickleson Two years after the misanthropic bonobo Koba attacked the human survivors in San Francisco, Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced against a rogue U.S. military faction known as Alpha-Omega led by a ruthless colonel. Alpha-Omega employs other apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called ""donkeys"". An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar's eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes' home, killing Blue Eyes and Caesar's wife Cornelia; Caesar unsuccessfully attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear. In this third version of the Planet of the Apes film, it has been 15 years since the ALZ-113 virus - also known by the human survivors as as the Simian Flu - spread across the globe killing billions of people (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), leading to a rise of intelligent apes. Their leader, the chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis), had tried to maintain peace between the apes and humans, until the chip Koba (Toby Kebbell) betrayed the apes and brought on the dawn of a new conflict (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Now, Caesar and his clan are hiding out in a command base in the Muir Woods while a ruthless Special Forces Colonel of the military faction Alpha-Omega is out to get them. The humans and apes are now caught up in all-out war.A team of soldiers quietly move through the woods to locate the apes. They are being helped by an ape named Red (Ty Olsson), whom the soldiers refer to as ""Donkey"". Red and another ape loyal to Koba look out for the command base. The soldiers launch their attack on the base by opening fire, but the apes retaliate with great force, hurling spears and shooting at soldiers as they ride on horses. Red, along with several surviving soldiers, are captured. Caesar decides to spare them and send them back to their camp unharmed to send the message that the apes are peaceful. Red, meanwhile, escapes from the hold of Winter (Aleks Paunovic) and runs back to the camp.Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones) returns home to his family and his mate Lake (Sara Canning). Caesar rejoins his wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) and youngest son Cornelius (Devyn Dalton). Caesar and his friends discuss a plan to move the clan away from the woods and toward a new home.That night as the apes are asleep, several Alpha-Omega soldiers, led by Colonel McCullough (Woody Harrelson), stalk the command base. The soldiers are killed, but McCullough shoots and kills Cornelia and Blue Eyes, having intended to kill Caesar. Caesar finds his family dead and leaps after McCullough as he gets away through the waterfall. McCullough then severs the rope and lets Caesar fall.Caesar returns to his base and has the other apes search for Cornelius. Thankfully, Caesar finds him safe. He places his son in Lake's care as he heads off to find McCullough while the rest of the apes head toward the desert in search of their new home. Caesar is followed by orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), chimp Rocket (Terry Notary), and gorilla Luca (Michael Adamthwaite). Caesar refuses to allow them to join him, but they insist as they want to protect their leader.The apes continue heading forward. They encounter a lone man who attempts to shoot them, but Caesar kills him first. They enter his home and find a little girl - later named Nova - (Amiah Miller) lying in bed. Although she appears frightened, Maurice gently hands her a doll. Nova tries to speak but is unable to. The apes proceed to continue their journey, but Nova steps out and sees the dead man (he was possibly her father). Despite Caesar saying they cannot take her, Maurice says he cannot leave her there either.The four apes come across a military camp. They find Winter, who has defected to the humans' side after Red promised he would be spared if Winter let him go, which lead Red to tell McCullough where to find the apes. Caesar interrogates Winter and learns that McCullough and his army are talking about heading toward a border. The apes then see that the humans are close. Caesar puts his hand over Winter's mouth to keep him quiet, and he ends up leaving him unconscious.At night, Caesar has a nightmare about Koba, who appears bloody and more scarred than before. He repeats to Caesar his final words - ""Ape not kill ape.""The apes and Nova pass through the snowy mountains. They find the bodies of three soldiers shot in the snow. One of them is still alive but is slowly dying. Caesar asks him why he was shot, but the soldier cannot speak just like Nova. Maurice points out that the man will die of his wounds, so Caesar puts him out of his misery.As the apes are looking around the area, a small creature in a jacket steals a rifle and one of the horses. The apes chase after the creature until they corner it in an abandoned building. It is a small ape, known as Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). He offers his jacket to Nova, seeing that she is cold. Bad Ape is capable of speech like Caesar. He tells Caesar that he lived in a zoo before the Simian Flu struck, and he got his name from what the humans always yelled at him. Bad Ape gives the group food that is labeled ""California Border"". Caesar asks where the food came from, and Bad Ape says it came from a ""human zoo"" (quarantine camp).Once the apes reach the military camp, they are attacked by a soldier. Luca kills the solider but is also mortally wounded. Luca tells Caesar that at least he was able to protect him this time. Even Nova cries for Luca as he had shown her kindness before. Caesar tells the others that this is why he wanted to come alone. Maurice tells Caesar that his hatred for the Colonel is making him like Koba.Caesar heads toward the camp at night by himself, only to find two captured apes hung up on a mountain overlooking the camp. One ape tells Caesar that the ape clan has been captured and are being forced to work. Red then appears behind Caesar and knocks him out with the butt of his rifle.Caesar wakes up to find himself face-to-face with McCullough. Caesar tells him he came for him after he killed Caesar's family. McCullough gives an insincere apology and says he meant to kill Caesar.Caesar is put to work with the rest of his captured apes. He sees Lake and Cornelius in a separate cage, with the little ape helplessly calling out for his father. The apes are then forced to work to build a wall, despite being starved and dehydrated. One ape is then whipped by Red, with Caesar yelling at him to stop. Caesar is whipped in his place. McCullough demands that Caesar tell the apes to continue working even as Caesar pleads for him to give them food and water. McCullough kills one ape and prepares to kill more, but Lake and the other apes continue to work for Caesar's sake.Red and a soldier called Preacher (Gabriel Chavarria) escort Caesar to McCullough's office in chains. Caesar once again tells the Colonel to give the apes food and water. He tells McCullough that he has no mercy. The Colonel verbally hits back that Caesar had shown up with the intention to kill him, but Caesar responds that he did show mercy by sparing his soldiers. McCullough then tells Caesar about his son, who was a soldier in his army until he was affected by the Simian Flu and began to lose his voice, along with other soldiers. McCullough killed his son and those soldiers as he knew they were regressing into a primitive state. He then explains that the wall is meant for another military force that is coming for him to put an end to his radicalized faction.The captured apes are finally given food and water, except for Caesar. He has another hallucination of Koba, who tells Caesar to join him. Meanwhile in the distance, Maurice, Rocket, Bad Ape, and Nova are seeing what's going on in the camp. Nova walks into the camp and approaches Caesar's cage. She gives him food and water, as well as the doll that Maurice gave her. The soldiers are approaching, and, fearing that they will kill Nova, Rocket steps in as a distraction to allow her to get away. The soldiers capture Rocket and McCullough picks up Nova's doll, which is now stained with blood.Maurice and Bad Ape find a way to sneak into the camp via an underground tunnel. They proceed to dig through but stop when they hit a water source, fearing it will flood the tunnel. They manage to seal off that part to prevent the flooding.Caesar and Rocket work together to find a way to make it to the other cage to save the ape children while Maurice and Bad Ape dig their way to the camp. Rocket creates a diversion by flinging their excrement at one of the guards before Bad Ape pulls him underground. The apes get the children out and make it through the tunnel to get away from the camp. Caesar embraces Cornelius upon seeing him again. Before leaving, Caesar admits to Rocket that he is like Koba because he cannot let go of his hatred for the Colonel. He heads back to McCullough's office to finish his mission.Soon, the rival military force begins attacking the camp, launching rockets at the soldiers while they fire back. Caesar makes it to McCullough's office and finds him drunk. He tries to speak but he has lost his voice too; the doll he'd taken from Caesar's pen had been contaminated with the new strain of Simian Flu that causes muteness in humans. Caesar grabs a gun, and the Colonel takes Caesar's hand to hold it to his head, ready for Caesar to pull the trigger. However, Caesar cannot bring himself to do so. McCullough grabs the gun and shoots himself in the head.In the midst of the chaos, the other apes have gotten away while Caesar tries to rejoin them. He grabs a grenade belt and tries to throw one at a leaking fuel tank, but he is shot with an arrow by Preacher. Red sees this as one of the soldiers is demanding a grenade launcher from him. Red turns on the humans and fires a grenade at Preacher before he finishes Caesar. Red has redeemed himself. but is immediately executed by one of the soldiers he'd been assisting. Caesar grabs the grenade and finishes the job, destroying the tank and blowing up the whole facility as he gets away through the tunnel.Caesar reaches the apes as the other militants cheer the fall of Alpha-Omega's camp. Some soldiers spot Caesar and are prepared to shoot him when an avalanche begins to rumble down the mountain. Caesar and the others apes (plus Nova on Maurice's back) climb up the trees to safety while the avalanche wipes out all the remaining soldiers.The apes and Nova then continue on their journey to a new home until they finally reach a new land that the apes are happy with. Caesar and Maurice watch as the apes are celebrating their freedom, but Maurice notices Caesar's arrow wound. Knowing that he is going to die, Caesar asks Maurice to make sure Cornelius is protected. Maurice assures him that his son will know who he was and what he did for his family. With that, Caesar dies in peace."

He has a rare medical facial deformity, which he refers to as ""mandibulofacial"", and has undergone 27 different surgeries as a result. Auggie has been home-schooled, but as he approaches fifth grade, his parents decide to enroll him in Beecher Prep, a private school. Before the school year begins, Auggie meets with Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin), the principal, who arranges a tour for him with three other students: Jack Will (Noah Jupe), Julian Albans (Bryce Gheisar), and Charlotte Cody (Elle McKinnon). When school starts, Auggie is initially ostracized by nearly the entire student body, but soon forms a close friendship with Jack. August (""Auggie"") Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) is 10 years old, a precocious little boy who lives in Brooklyn with his parents, older sister Olivia (""Via"") (Izabela Vidovic), and dog Daisy. He was born with a rare medical facial deformity, mandibulofacial dysostosis (otherwise known as Treacher Collins Syndrome), and has undergone 27 surgeries in order to see, smell, speak and hear. Up until this point, his parents Isabel (Julia Roberts) and Nate (Owen Wilson) have home-schooled him, but it is decided that he be enrolled to attend middle school at Beecher Prep. Before starting classes, Auggie meets Principal Tushman (Mandy Patinkin) who arranges a tour for him with three other students: Jack (Noah Jupe), Julian (Bryce Gheisar), and Charlotte (Elle McKinnon). When school starts, Auggie is received with stares and jests from his classmates, leaving him to silently bear the tension. However, he soon forms a friendship with Jack and finds support through his teacher, Mr. Browne (Daveed Diggs).For Halloween, though Auggie planned to dress as Boba Fett, he settles on a Ghostface costume from the previous year and walks through school feeling optimistic since the getup allows him some anonymity. Upon entering homeroom, he sees Jack speaking to his friends Julian, Amos (Ty Consiglio), Miles (Kyle Breitkopf), and Henry (James A Hughes). Unrecognized because of his costume, Auggie is dismayed to hear them making fun of him behind his back. Among other remarks, the one that stings the most is that ""[he] would kill [himself] if [he] looked like Auggie"". Auggie becomes sick and his mother has to leave a mother-daughter day with Via to pick him up. Though she is hurt, Via convinces Auggie to go trick-or-treating.Auggie finds a sympathetic soul in Summer (Millie Davis) and confides in her about Jack's betrayal. Later, when Jack asks Summer why Auggie is avoiding him, she only says ""Ghostface"". Suddenly realizing what he's done, Jack resolves to make it up to Auggie and agrees to be partnered with him for the Science Fair, despite Julian's protests. When Julian confronts him in the hall and calls Auggie a freak, Jack hits him in the face and they fight before teachers break them up. Jack is suspended for two days and, though he refuses to give a reason for the fight in an apology letter to Principal Tushman, the principal responds saying that he thinks he understands why, and encourages Jack to keep being the good kid he knows he is. Jack then sends an apology to Auggie via Minecraft, telling him he said what he did only to gain favor with Julian's friend group, and they reconcile.Meanwhile, Via signs up for the drama club with classmate Justin (Nadji Jeter) with whom she soon begins a relationship. At that point, she realizes she cannot keep secrets from someone she cares for and admits to him that, contrary to what she initially told him, she is not an only child. She brings Justin home to meet her mother and brother. Justin treats Auggie with kindness and tells Via that he understands her hesitation to tell him about her brother. Via is selected to be her classmate Miranda's (Danielle Rose Russell) understudy in the lead role for her school's production of 'Our Town'. On opening night, however, upon learning that her family is not in attendance while Via's is, Miranda feigns illness. Via fills in for the role and gives a moving performance, earning a standing ovation.Meanwhile, Auggie's popularity and circle of friends grows throughout the year, but he is still bullied by Julian and his friends. When Mr. Browne finds Auggie holding a photograph that had been stuck to his locker, he presses him, then Amos, for information. This results in Julian and his parents being summoned to see Principal Tushman who explains the school's zero-tolerance policy on bullying. He shows Julian's parents (Yan-Kay Crystal LoweandSteve Bacic), the photograph from which Auggie has been photoshopped out and on which the sentence ""Do everyone a favor and die"" is written. Julian's mother admits to photoshopping Auggie out of the picture because she wants visitors to their home to focus on her son rather than the Pullmans. She further states that her son's normal good behavior and their financial donations to the school should supersede any suspension. Principal Tushman, however, is persistent and won't abide by bribery or threats. While he accepts Julian's apology, he cannot prevent the boy's parents from deciding to place him in another school.Later, at a class trip to a nature retreat, Auggie and Jack are confronted and antagonized by a group of seventh graders. Things become heated as Jack and Auggie attempt to fight back, but Amos, Miles, and Henry appear to defend them and they all escape the seventh graders. They retreat to the edge of a lake where Auggie becomes emotional at the kindness he's received, especially by former bullies.At that year's graduation, Auggie thanks his mother for enrolling him in school. She tells him, ""You really are a wonder, Auggie."" He is given the Henry Ward Beecher Medal for his strength and courage throughout the school year. The movie ends with everyone cheering Auggie as he delivers a voiceover narration (quoting the last precept Mr. Browne gave in class): ""Be kind, for everyone is fighting a hard battle. And if you really want to see what people are, all you have to do is look."""
Transformers: The Last Knight,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3371366/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A deadly threat from Earth's history reappears and a hunt for a lost artifact takes place between Autobots and Decepticons, while Optimus Prime encounters his creator in space. Optimus Prime finds his dead home planet, Cybertron, in which he comes to find he was responsible for its destruction. He finds a way to bring Cybertron back to life, but in order to do so, Optimus needs to find an artifact that is on Earth. Humans and Transformers are at war, Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Saving our world falls upon the shoulders of an unlikely alliance: Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), Bumblebee, an English Lord (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and an Oxford Professor (Laura Haddock).—ahmetkozan Three years after Optimus Prime left Earth, the Autobots are still a world threat and they are at war with the Decepticons. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) finds a Talisman given from a dying Transformer. However, the U.S. Military and the Decepticons find Cade and the Autobots and are now on the run again. Cade meets a Transformer known as Cogman and tells him and Bumblebee to head to London with him. They meet with an English Lord known as Sir Edmund Burton (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and head to a Cybertronian Knights ship underwater. They encounter Optimus Prime, but he's now evil and his master is Quintessa. Quintessa's intention is to collide Cybertron and Earth so Cybertron can begin again. and it's up to Cade, an English professor known as Vivian Wembley (Laura Haddock), Sir Edmund Burton, Cogman, Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots to save the world.—ahmetkozan In 484 A.D., King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) and his knights fight a losing battle against the Saxons. Elsewhere, Merlin (Stanley Tucci) approaches the Knights of Iacon, a group of Transformers hiding on Earth, to help win the war. They hand him an alien staff, before transforming together into Dragonstorm and turn the tide of the battle, but warn Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff. In the present, a year after the Hong Kong uprising, Optimus Prime crash-lands on Cybertron and meets his alleged creator Quintessa. She blames him for Cybertron's destruction and brainwashes him into helping to gain Merlin's staff, which can absorb Earth's energy to restore Cybertron. Optimus is renamed Nemesis Prime. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering Unicron, the ancient enemy of Cybertron and whose horns are emerging across the planet. This fifth Transformers film opens in England during the Dark Ages. King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) and his knights are all in the middle of an epic battle, but their side is losing and being crushed by gigantic fireballs. Arthur awaits his last hope, his chief adviser and wizard Merlin (Stanley Tucci), to save them. The other knights dismiss Merlin as nothing more than a drunk. After downing his drink, Merlin finds a Cybertronian Knight and asks for his help in the fight. The Knight presents Merlin with a powerful staff that will allow him to control Dragonstorm. Merlin wields the staff, which brings Dragonstorm down to help Arthur and his army lay waste to their enemies.In the present day, Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) has been lost in his mission to seek out his creators. He is seen floating through space while frozen.On planet Earth, the Transformers have been deemed illegal since the battle in Hong Kong (in the fourth film). Most of the Autobots have gone into hiding, with Topspin hiding out somewhere in Cuba with Agent Simmons (John Turturro). The Transformers Reaction Force, led by Santos (Santiago Cabrera), has been active for the last few years to eliminate any Transformers they come across.A NASA engineer (Tony Hale) detects something heading toward Earth in a matter of three days. It's the planet Cybertron.In Chicago, a group of kids run toward the city's ruins and find a pod containing a Cybertronian Knight. Moments later, a TRF sentinel stomps around and attacks the kids. The sentinel is destroyed by an Autobot named Canopy, belonging to a young girl named Izabella (Isabela Moner), who also takes care of a little Autobot named Sqweeks (voice of Reno Wilson). A TRF drone then strikes Canopy down. Despite Izabella pleading with Canopy to stay strong, he dies. Bumblebee then arrives to take out the drone. He is followed by Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), who has been in hiding for siding with the Autobots. Not long after, Santos and his men show up to try and apprehend Cade. Bumblebee splits himself into multiple pieces to fight back against the TRF agents. Cade then has Santos pinned to the ground with a gun aimed at him, but he is stopped by William Lennox (Josh Duhamel), who now works with TRF. Lennox talks Cade out of doing anything to Santos. After their confrontation, Cade goes to the Knight in his pod. The Knight dies, but not before giving Cade a talisman that grants him a special power. Meanwhile, the Decepticon Barricade has witnessed all this while disguised as a police cruiser.Optimus crash-lands in what's left of Cybertron. He is held down by the Infernocons. Optimus is approached by Quintessa (voice of Gemma Chan), who is apparently one of Cybertron's creators. Optimus tries to go after her, but she is able to hold him back as they both claim that the other has betrayed their fellow Transformers. Quintessa has Optimus under her control, and she tells him that Earth is really a disguised form of Cybertron's great enemy Unicron. She corrupts Optimus and tells him that in order for Cybertron to live, Earth must be destroyed. Quintessa uses this to give Optimus a chance at redemption, which he accepts.Back on Earth, Lennox reports to his superior, General Morshower (Glenn Morshower), about the impending impact with Cybertron. They learn that the newly-resurrected Megatron (voice of Frank Welker) is seeking the talisman that Cade has. The TRF reluctantly makes a deal with Megatron to release his fellow Decepticons from an underground prison. Megatron requests Mohawk, Nitro Zeus, and Onslaught. Megatron also requests Dreadbot and Berserker, but the TRF thinks they are too risky to be let out.In England, Oxford professor Viviane Wembley (Laura Haddock) is playing a game with her colleagues and she wins, but is frequently reminded by her male colleagues, plus her mother and mother's friends, that she's single. Viviane leads a tour in an Arthurian museum, telling her students about the lore and myth surrounding these stories, and bluntly saying that it's all bullshit.Cade goes to a junkyard where his friend Jimmy (Jerrod Carmichael) is helping him hide the Autobots - Hound (voice of John Goodman), Drift (voice of Ken Watanabe), Crosshairs (voice of John DiMaggio), Wheelie (voice of Tom Kenny), Daytrader (voice of Steve Buscemi), and Grimlock. Jimmy complains that Grimlock is hard to handle. Cade has been followed by Izabella and Sqweeks. Although Cade tries to turn her away, she tells him that she has nowhere to go because Decepticons killed her family, so all she had were Canopy and Sqweeks, and now Canopy is dead. Cade allows her to stay. He then goes to call his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) while she is at college, but he is unable to speak for fear that he may be found by TRF. Tessa tells him that she is fine and that she loves him, but also that he needs to find himself a girlfriend.Megatron and his goons arrive at the junkyard to find the talisman and kill the Autobots. The Autobots come out of hiding and start fighting the Decepticons. Onslaught and Mohawk are both quickly blasted to pieces. As Cade runs away, he is found by a small humanoid Transformer named Cogman (Jim Carter). He is looking for Cade but nearly loses him when Cade is attacked by a drone. He still gets Cade to go with him eventually.Viviane is taken by the Autobot Hot Rod (Omar Sy) to the mansion of Sir Edmund Burton (Anthony Hopkins), where she also meets Cade and Cogman. Burton explains to Cade and Viviane the legacy of the Witwiccan Order, having started since the time of King Arthur. Throughout history, the Transformers have been working in the background to help humanity, and the Witwiccans (including Sam Witwicky) have been doing their part to keep the Transformers protected. In a flashback, we see the Transformers helping American soldiers fight against the Nazis in World War II. Burton also mentions the Staff of Merlin, which only a descendant of Merlin's can wield. He reveals to Viviane that she is the last descendant, and her father had kept this a secret from her up until his death. She needs to wield it to prevent something catastrophic from hitting Earth. Burton then explains the talisman, which has wrapped itself around Cade. It chose him because it considers him an honorable man.TRF agents show up and force everyone out of Burton's mansion. Hot Rod holds them off for a brief moment by trapping them in a time-contained bubble.Cade, Viviane, Cogman, Burton, and Bumblebee locate the old submarine HMS Alliance with the help of Simmons (who wants to be an honorary member of the Order) to help them locate the Staff. They are taken to the bottom of the ocean where they find a machine and the Staff in a chamber of Knights. The Knight Skullitron awakens and attacks everyone. The other Knights rise and start to fight just as TRF soldiers show up as well. Viviane goes for the Staff, which brings the machine up to the surface.Optimus shows up to take the Staff and give it to Quintessa so that she can activate the machine and use it to take Earth's core energy and transfer it to Cybertron, which would fry all human life. Optimus then fights Bumblebee while still under Quintessa's control. Before Optimus can strike a fatal blow, Bumblebee's voice comes back at the most convenient time to snap Optimus out of his control and remind him who he really is. Although Optimus is good again, the other Knights attempt to attack for his attempted betrayal. Cade steps in with the talisman, which (somehow) gives him the power to wield Excalibur. The Knights yield to Cade.The final battle comes to Stonehenge, where Megatron and Quintessa initiate their attack on Earth. Cybertron begins to tear through various parts of Earth. The TRF decide to join forces with the Autobots. Also arriving to the fight are Jimmy, Izabella, and the rest of the Autobots. In the chaos, Megatron kills Burton, who dies with Cogman by his side. As the heroes attempt to stop the machine, Quintessa sends out the Infernocons and a massive gun shooting at them. Lennox tries to pull everyone back as it is way too risky. Izabella sends Sqweeks out to destroy the gun, giving everyone a chance to fight. The Infernocons go after Optimus, but he decapitates all of them with one swift motion.Within Cybertron, the Autobots fight against Megatron while Viviane attempts to regain the Staff. Optimus chops off Megatron's arm before he kills again, and then Optimus kicks Megatron out and sends him plummeting back to Earth. Viviane nearly falls to her doom but Hot Rod freezes time again and helps her get closer to the Staff. Optimus confronts Quintessa, who holds him back again until Bumblebee comes from behind and seemingly destroys her. Viviane then takes control of the Staff and stops the machine, saving the Earth.Earth is saved once again. Cade and Viviane make plans to go on a date, and Cade takes Izabella in so she can have a real family again. Optimus sends a call to all Autobots as he realizes that Earth has been and always will be his home.During the closing credits, a team of scientists are gathered around a site. Quintessa is alive and takes a human disguise to approach one of them, saying she has a way to destroy Unicron. We then see what appears to be a massive mechanical horn sticking out of the ground."
Girls Trip,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3564472/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When four lifelong friends travel to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival, sisterhoods are rekindled, wild sides are rediscovered, and there's enough dancing, drinking, brawling and romancing to make the Big Easy blush. Four best friends, the ""Flossy Posse"", have grown distant over the years. When lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce (Regina Hall), who is dubbed ""the next Oprah"", is offered an opportunity to be the keynote speaker at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, she decides to bring along her friends to turn her work vacation into a girls' trip.

While on the trip, Sasha is sent a tip that shows a picture of a black man's head kissing an Instagram model, presumed to be Ryan's husband, Stewart. The friends are reluctant to tell Ryan, but when Dina spills the news, Ryan shocks them by telling them she is already aware of the situation and that they are in couple's counseling. Nevertheless, when Dina sees Stewart at their hotel, she threatens him with a broken bottle, resulting in her getting ejected and banned from the hotel. In solidarity all the girls leave with her, but the only hotel they are able to get is a sleazy one-star motel frequented by customers of prostitutes. Writer and lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce, often touted as a mixture of the nextOprah Winfrey/Martha Stewart, and her Florida A and M college sweetheart husband, former football star Stewart Pierce, have developed themselves into a successful brand in providing inspiration to the world. Their manager, Elizabeth Davelli, has not only managed to get Ryan the keynote speaker position at this year's Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, but also a meeting for both in New Orleans with Bethany Marshall of major retailer Best Mart to discuss a potential lucrative partnership including a lifestyle television show, which would put them on the top echelon of their business. What Ryan has not told anyone is there is problems in the marriage, Stewart who has cheated on her, something she is unaware still continues. That problem only masks Ryan's insecurity, her fear being exposed as a fraud to her fans. Ryan decides to invite her three best friends from college, they who were known as the Flossy Posse, to New Orleans for the VIP/five star weekend. Graduating approximately twenty years ago, they, at the time, believed they would be BFFs, but time and changes in their lives have led to them not hanging out together as a group in five years. Sasha Franklin, once a respected journalist, has for various reasons become a celebrity gossip blogger and is now broke, close to losing everything which she has not told the others in the posse. The party girl in college, divorced Lisa Cooper has become the conservative nurturer, her entire focus now on her two children and her career as a nurse rather than herself, sex which has been non-existent since the divorce. And Dina was and still is the type that will do whatever she wants and state her mind without fear of whatever the possible consequences, which has just led to her being fired from her latest job. This mixture of circumstances in their lives, especially desperate Sasha possibly going to extreme lengths for dirt on anyone famous this weekend for money, may end up testing their friendship, that test exacerbated if things for Ryan and Sasha spiral downward out of control.—Huggo"

The Upside,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1987680/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A comedic look at the relationship between a wealthy man with quadriplegia and an unemployed man with a criminal record who's hired to help him. Philip is a disabled billionaire, who feels that life is not worth living. To help him in his day-to-day routine, he hires Del, a parolee who is trying to reconnect with his estranged wife. What begins as a professional relationship develops into a friendship as Del shows his grouchy charge that life is worth living.—Tom Daly The film opens with Dell Scott (Kevin Hart) driving Philip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston) through the city of Chicago. They are followed by police after Dell starts to speed up. He bets Philip that he can lose the cops, and he does for a moment until they corner him in the streets. They force Dell out of the car until he tells them that he was rushing to the hospital because Philip is having a seizure. They see him foaming at the mouth and then escort the two to the hospital, but they are just faking it and laugh over the cops believing them.Six months earlier.Dell is recently released convict who is meeting with his parole officer to try and turn his life around. He must obtain a number of signatures and hand them in by the next day. He goes around to different workplaces with little to no interest in what they offer other than the signatures. Dell's last stop is Philip's home. As he is a quadriplegic, Philip interviews several candidates alongside his assistant Yvonne Pendleton (Nicole Kidman) for the position of Philip's caregiver. Dell waits for over an hour to be called in, and he barges in during an interview demanding to be met because he has to go meet his son. Philip decides to listen to Dell's story, and when he mentions doing time in prison, Philip asks what he was in for. Dell tries to change the subject by turning it around on him and says that he must be offered the job after being asked that question. Philip does so, but Dell declines, as he is not interested in being hired and only wants the signature.Dell goes to a school to pick up his son Anthony (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), but he is told by someone that his mother picked him up. Dell visits Anthony and his ex-wife Latrice (Aja Naomi King). Neither of them has much interest in Dell trying to be there now, what with him being absent for most of Anthony's life. It doesn't help that he and Latrice live in a crummy apartment that is falling apart. Dell gives Anthony a storybook for his birthday, except it's a book he swiped from Philip before leaving.Dell is contacted by Yvonne to come back as Philip wants to hire Dell for the job, simply because he was the worst and least qualified candidate. She doesn't trust Dell due to his criminal history and is concerned for how Dell will handle Philip, but he assures her he can do a good job. Yvonne establishes a three strikes rule on Dell to make sure he doesn't screw up, and she lets him know that the job is a live-in position, and it pays very well since Philip is so wealthy.Dell starts off rocky as he isn't quick to respond to Philip's calls via opera music, or he just makes things like feeding Philip his breakfast a daunting task. Dell meets Philip's nurse Maggie (Golshifteh Farahani), who shows Dell how to take care of Philip physically. This involves demonstrating the use of a catheter and how it is applied, to Dell's discomfort. Slowly, Dell starts to adjust to Philip's needs and acts better. However, Philip insists to Dell that he follow a strict DNR (do not resuscitate) rule if Philip stops breathing. This is put to the test one night as Philip appears to be suffocating, but Dell, insisting he needs the job, gives Philip oxygen and forces him to breathe.After getting his first paycheck, Dell goes to find Latrice and give the whole thing to her and Anthony. She is somewhat pleased until Dell asks her to get the book back from Anthony since it wasn't his to give. Latrice gets upset once again and tells Dell to do his own dirty work. He then goes to find Anthony but finds him talking to a suspicious older man. Dell misses Anthony before he enters his building and has to leave when he sees some kids messing around with Philip's car that Dell was allowed to drive. He is then contacted by Yvonne, and when he returns to Philip's home, Yvonne calls his absence his third strike and tries to fire him until Philip clarifies that he allowed Dell to take the car to see his son.Dell takes Philip around the city after smoking a joint to ease a pain that Philip feels in his legs. During their walk, Philip tells Dell how he became a quadriplegic.

When Baby arrives at their hideout, he is surprised that this job's crew consists of the easy-going Buddy (Jon Hamm), his sharpshooter wife Darling (Eiza González), and Bats; all repeat members, which is highly irregular, because Doc refuses to work with the same team more than once.

After burying the hatchet inDaddy's Home (2015), the stepfather with a heart of gold, Brad, and the kids' biological dad with the perfect six-pack, Dusty, are now proud co-dads, working in unison to care for Megan and Dylan. This year, with Christmas just around the corner, the once-incompatible parents and their families decide to spend the holidays together; however, things will take a turn for the unexpected when Dusty's alpha-dad, Kurt, and Brad's touchy-feely father, Don, decide to pay a visit. Now--as the merry holidaymakers end up in a snow-capped cabin for a week--it seems that there's no escape from an impending Yuletide disaster unless the two pairs of fathers learn how to coexist and work together for the sake of the kids. Will things work out in the end? Can the four daddies save Christmas?—Nick Riganas After finally becoming friends at the end of the first 'Daddy's Home' film, Brad Whittaker (Will Ferrell) and Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) have a co-dad system where their two children, Megan and Dylan, take turns at each father's house. Dusty has also remarried, this time to Karen (Alexandra Ambrosio), a writer, and is stepdad to Adrianna, Karen's daughter.Brad and his wife, Sara (Linda Cardellini), along with Dusty and Karen, attend a school play for Megan, where she announces to the whole audience that she doesn't like the fact that she has to go back and forth to different houses all the time. Back at the house, after the play, Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases and instead do one ""together Christmas"". As soon as Dusty announces the news to the kids, the phone rings. Dylan picks it up and announces it's Grandpa Kurt (Mel Gibson), Dusty's ex-astronaut, womanizing father. Kurt tells Dusty that he's coming for Christmas and is coming into the airport in the morning. Brad tells Dusty that his parents are also supposed to be coming for the holiday.At the airport the next day, Dusty tells Brad that his father is going to make fun of them since he won't understand their co-dad arrangement. When Kurt arrives, he mistakes Brad for a chauffeur. When Dusty explains that Brad is the stepdad to his children, Kurt doesn't like it. Brad's overbearing and over-cheerful dad, Don (John Lithgow) arrives next and proceeds to hug and kiss Brad on the lips, showing that they have a loving, but very unusual father/son relationship. This further unnerves Kurt. Don tells Brad that his mother didn't come along, because she wasn't feeling well.Back at the house, Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don, since he is very present in their lives, while Kurt hasn't seen the children since they were toddlers. After seeing Brad and Dusty trying to figure out where to spend Christmas Day at, since they are purposing opening presents at Brad's house and eating Christmas dinner at Dusty's house, Kurt rents a large cabin through Airbnb, to house all of them through the holiday week. As Brad and Dusty pack the bags into the car, Dusty tells Brad that Kurt thinks the two men are harboring bad feelings for each other, but are just hiding it from everyone by pretending to be friends. When Kurt comes up, they change the subject. Seeing Dusty trying to get all of the suitcases into the trunk, Kurt tells Dusty that he's not going to be able to. Dusty tells Kurt that he is going to be able to. When Kurt walks away, Dusty does end up having trouble with getting all the bags in the car. To counter this, he takes one suitcase and throws it over a hedge, making room. At the cabin, Brad asks if anyone has seen his suitcase.Throughout the week, Brad and Dusty's co-dad relationship is put to the test by Kurt's meddling. Meanwhile, Dusty tries to get close to his stepdaughter, Adrianna, but she doesn't like him and repeatedly tells him that he isn't her father. Sara also tries to bond with Karen but is taken aback by some of Karen's actions, like shoplifting clothes from a store.Dylan also develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door. He gets made fun of it by Megan and Adrianna. Later, Dylan approaches Brad for advice on how to deal with girls. Brad tells Dylan that it would be better for Dylan to be that guy that his crush tells all her secrets to and that he should strive to be in the friend zone. Dusty and Kurt overhear this, and Dusty intervenes with his brand of advice. Dylan runs away, saying he would rather be in the friend zone with her.Later, Brad, Dusty, Kurt, Don, Megan, and Dylan go searching for the perfect ""Together Christmas tree."" This leads to Brad, inadvertently, cutting down a cell phone tower with a chainsaw, electrocuting him and sending him flying through the air. Dusty ends up reviving Brad and bringing him back from the dead. Brad ends up being charged $20,000 for the destruction of the cell tower.Brad ends up using the tower as a Christmas tree for the cabin. After lighting it up, Brad realizes that Don isn't there. He deduces that his father got separated while they were in the woods. Brad and Dusty go to find Don, which they do. They find Don, face down, being surrounded by a pack of grey wolves, which Dusty manages to scare away.The next day, the family goes out to take the kids to see Santa. While there, Kurt convinces Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun, which he does ask for. Brad and Sara tell Dylan that a shotgun for hunting means that a poor innocent animal will lose its life. This convinces Dylan to change his mind, but Megan instead decides she wants to go hunting. While out hunting the next day, Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital.At the hospital, Dusty and Kurt begin to bond after they almost begin fighting when Kurt tries to leave the hospital. That night, Brad, Dusty, Don & Kurt go to an improv comedy club where the four men are relaxing and having a good time watching the show. Kurt gets up to go get another drink at the bar. Dusty sees Kurt picking up a woman at the bar and leaves with her. Brad enters Don into the improv show, and Dusty chooses a topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of an improv skit. As the skit progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife (Brad's mother) in real life. Dusty tells Brad that he picked up on it through subtle hints that Don gave off throughout the movie. The audience believes that this is all part of the show, even when Brad tries to tell the audience that it is not.The next day, Brad confronts Dusty. After Dusty reveals that he chose the infidelity subject for the improv game because he wanted to get back at Brad, because of how Brad has a good relationship with Don. Brad says he knows that is why Dusty chose that particular topic and to get back at Dusty; Brad has invited Adrianna's real dad, Roger (John Cena), to the cabin for Christmas.That evening, the entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation. Brad gets into a fight with Dusty after Brad wants to play Joseph, which Dusty is currently playing. This breaks out in front of a crowd that is watching. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost comes to blows with Roger. Dusty makes a snowball and throws it at Roger, but accidentally hits Don instead. In retaliation, Brad makes an ice ball and threatens to throw it at Dusty, but chooses not to. Brad turns around and begins walking away. Don gets up as well and steps in front of Dusty, just as Brad changes his mind and throws the ice ball at Dusty, but Don, inadvertently, gets hit again. As Don gets back up and walks away, Roger throws a snowball he had in his hand away, which also coincidentally hits Don.The next morning, Christmas Day, the families all pack up to leave. On their way out of town, the families are forced back to town on account of a blizzard. They are forced to take shelter at a movie theater. With every other movie being sold out, due to the huge influx of business from other families seeking shelter at the theater, both families go to see the last movie available: Missile Tow, a factitious Liam Neeson holiday action film.When the power cuts off during the movie, the families go to the lobby where each man confronts their father about the secrets, lies, and attitudes. Don confronts Brad about not telling him the truth about his divorce, while Dusty tries to talk to Kurt. When Dylan sees the girl he has a crush on, is also there at the theater, he is teased again by Megan and Adrianna. After remembering some advice given to him by Kurt, Dylan walks toward her to kiss her. All of a sudden, he doesn't kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna, his stepsister. Roger gets freaked out and attempts to leave with Adrianna, but is confronted by Dusty. He deduces that the reason why Adrianna hasn't warmed up to him is that he has never told her that he loves her, which he does. He also tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family. Roger almost leaves without Adrianna, but has a change of heart and decides to stay. Don and Brad also reconcile.Sometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to leave to head back to their respective homes. Seeing how close that Don & Brad are and want that same kind of relationship with his son, Kurt kisses Dusty on the lips. Afterwards, Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they're going to spend New Years in Las Vegas.As they prepare for Brad's mom and her new husband's flight to arrive, Dusty prepares Brad. When she does arrive, both men discover that Brad's new stepdad is Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the pilot of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight. Brad and Dusty remember that they watched the film ""Sully"" together not too long ago and Brad appears to be welcoming towards him. When Sully approaches him and asks if he is Brad, Brad says he is not (echoing what Dusty did to Brad in the first film). Brad runs down the terminal and says that Sully will never replace his father, because Sully has only one great personal story, whereas his father has thousands of stories."

Poirot is unhappy that his long-awaited break is being interrupted, but Bouc offers to take him to France on the Orient Express. The trip will be three days long, and Poirot settles for at least having that long to relax.Reaching the train, Bouc is surprised to learn that all the compartments have been booked (an uncommon occurrence) however one of the passengers has failed to show on time, so his ticket is forfeit. Also aboard are a myriad of other characters; as well as Debenham and Arbuthnot there is an unpleasant American by the name of Samuel Ratchell (Johnny Depp), his valet Edward Masterman (Derek Jacobi) and secretary Hector MacQueen (Josh Gad), the Austrian Professor Gerhard Hardman (Willem Defoe), American socialite Mrs. Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Italian car salesman Beniamino Marquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), the elderly Princess Dragomiroff (Judi Dench) and her assistant Hildegarde Schmidt (Olivia Colman), unhappy missionary Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) and finally the Count and Countess Andrenyi (respectively played by Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton).The first night and day pass without incident, although Poirot is put out at having to share his room with MacQueen. The next evening, Ratchett approaches Poirot and requests that he serve as his bodyguard for the duration of the trip as he has been receiving threatening letters and assumes they're from his former clients to whom he sold forged paintings. Poirot, who took an immediate dislike to Ratchett, refuses on the basis he seeks out criminals and won't help them. Ratchett offers increasing amounts of money and even indirectly threatens Poirot with a gun, but Poirot won't be bought or intimidated and leaves in disgust.That night, Poirot (who was moved to Bouc's cabin) looks forward to a good night's sleep but finds it in short supply; first there is a noise seeming to come from the compartment next to his (Ratchett's), but when the Conductor who goes by the name of Pierre Michel inquires as to it a voice responds that everything is fine. Poirot is also woken up by a bell and a knock, and during the disturbances, he spots a figure in a red kimono running down the hallway. Meanwhile, there is an avalanche which stops the train in its tracks, leaving everyone stranded on the line. Poirot is thrown from his bed, where he spies Marquez picking up spilled photos.Since the Express was expected to arrive at their next station the following day, everyone will need to wait for a rescue team to be sent. In the morning, Poirot finds out that Ratchett has been murdered in his bed during the night, having been stabbed numerous times in a classic locked-door mystery. Bouc asks Poirot to investigate the case; however, Poirot initially refuses; he was supposed to be on holiday after all. Bouc implores him to look into the murder, as the Yugoslav police will likely look for a scapegoat and may target Marquez or Arbuthnot. Faced with this, an exasperated Poirot agrees. After confirming that no-one left or entered the carriage during the night and that no-one is on the train that shouldn't be, Poirot knows that any of the other passengers or conductor could be the murderer. He takes Bouc as his assistant; as Bouc was sleeping in another carriage, he couldn't be the murderer.An investigation of the body shows that Ratchett was stabbed twelve times; however the wounds are not consistent... while some are certainly lethal, others are shallow. This implies that the murderer was drunk, but Ratchett was of good physical built, armed and already wary so it's very unlikely he was overpowered. Investigating his room, they find the threatening letters as well as a partially destroyed note connecting Ratchett to the case of Daisy Armstrong. Poirot remembers the case; Daisy Armstrong was a little girl who was kidnapped and then murdered despite the family paying the ransom which caused her mother Sonia (Miranda Raison) to go into premature labor killing both her and her unborn child (with Daisy's father committing suicide soon after). Daisy's murderer was a man called Lanfranco Cassetti who got away with the crime, and Poirot and Bouc soon discover from the evidence that Ratchett was Cassetti and whoever killed him likely had a connection with that case. Some more evidence is found, a blood-stained handkerchief with the initial 'H' and the button from a conductor's uniform is found in Mrs. Hubbard's room (she had previously been claiming someone was in her room). An investigation of Michel's uniform shows all the buttons to be present, so an investigation of everyone's luggage is conducted (except for the Count and Countess as they have diplomatic immunity). The uniform doesn't show up, and Poirot deduces the culprit is trying to outsmart him when the kimono he spotted the previous night is found in his suitcase. Mrs. Hubbard is later stabbed in the back, but the wound is very minor, and she cannot identify who did it. The uniform with the missing button is later found on an overhead rack, leaving that lead at a dead end.A rescue team arrives and start freeing the Orient Express from the snow. Poirot and Bouc speak to MacQueen and find he had a motive for the murder as he had been skimming money off Cassetti's accounts. They also find a connection to the Daisy Armstrong case; MacQueen's father had attempted to prosecute Armstrong's nursemaid causing her to commit suicide, with his career being destroyed when the truth was known. As his interviews and investigations proceed Poirot finds that many of the passengers had a connection to the Daisy Armstrong; Princess Dragomiroff was Sonia Armstrong's godmother and friend to her mother, Linda Arden, Schmidt was the Armstrong's cook, Arbuthnot was in the Army with Daisy's father, Marquez was the family's chauffeur, Pilar was Daisy's nursemaid and had fallen asleep when the girl was abducted, Debenham was Daisy's Governess and Masterman was butler to the Armstrong family. The biggest connection, however, is the Countess Andrenyi... she is Helena Goldenberg, Daisy's aunt. Despite all this, Poirot finds himself unable to narrow down who committed the act.While questioning Debenham about the murder, he is confronted by Arbuthnot (who is also implied to be Debenham's secret lover) who claims responsibility for the murder. He attempts to shoot Poirot but misses and then flees. Poirot realizes that Arbuthnot never meant to kill him (Arbuthnot was a sharpshooter in the army and would never have missed his shot at such close range) and demands that all the suspects be assembled which they quickly are (in the tunnel, for some reason). Poirot reveals that there are two possible solutions to the murder, and the first is simple yet unlikely... Cassetti was murdered by one of the many enemies he acquired over the years as Ratchett who got aboard the train and then fled after the murder. The second is outlandish but fits the facts better: everyone board was involved in the murder. Poirot has found even more connections to the Daisy Armstrong case; Gerhard Hardman is actually an American detective called Cyrus who was in love with the nurse falsely accused who turns out to have been Michel's sister while Mrs. Hubbard is Linda Arden. He has reasoned that, so that no-one person would have been responsible, all of the suspects entered Cassetti's room and stabbed him in turn as a form of execution, no-one knows exactly who killed him. Arden admits she was responsible for bringing everyone together, determined to make Cassetti pay for what he did to her daughter and granddaughter. Poirot tells Arden that now he is the only person who can expose their plot and challenges someone to shoot him, leaving his gun on the table. Arden picks it up but instead attempts to shoot herself, but the gun isn't loaded as Poirot just wanted to see what she would do. He watches as Arden collapses into tears.The train is unearthed and continues on its way. Poirot decides that there is no justice to be found in this case; everyone aboard has already suffered greatly from Cassetti's crime, while Cassetti himself was an evil man who had gotten away with murder and deserved what happened to him. He notes that this is one imbalance of letting 12 people get away with murder that he will have to live with. When the train reaches the station, Poirot tells the police that his first theory is correct; The murderer was an enemy of Ratchett who has fled. The police believe him, and the passengers continue on their way.Poirot decides to disembark the train at this point, eager to finally get some rest. Once again, however, his reputation has preceded him, and he is approached by a messenger as he is needed in Egypt due to a ""death on the Nile"". Although tired, Poirot decides to take the case, stopping for a moment to see the Orient Express disappear into the distance."

Kingsman: The Golden Circle,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4649466/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the Kingsman's headquarters is destroyed and the world is held hostage, an allied spy organization in the United States is discovered. These two elite secret agencies must band together to defeat a common enemy. After the Kingsman headquarters is blown up by a psychotic criminal named Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), the surviving agents find their way to an allied secret organization based in Kentucky, named ""Statesman"". The two agencies must now work together in order to save the world and take down the so called ""Golden Circle"".—Viir khubchandani A devastating attack leaves the Kingsman with just two surviving agents, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and Merlin (Mark Strong). They must travel to the United States to find the Statesman, a forgotten ally operating out of Kentucky with its own distinctly American way of doing things. New allies and old friends band together to face the global threat of Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore) and the Golden Circle.—Cinemaniacal A year after the events of the previous movie, Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) has officially joined the Kingsman, taken his late mentor Harry Hart's (Colin Firth's) title of Galahad, and begun a relationship with Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden (Henna Alström). On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft), a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal chords (but was inadvertently saved by Eggsy) during the Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) incident. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's cybernetic arm, severed in the skirmish, hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer in Eggsy's car. With the information gained, Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore), the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle, launches missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and kill all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong). When the Kingsman headquarters is destroyed and the world is held hostage, their journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the U.S. called ""Statesman"", dating back to the day they were both founded. In a new adventure that tests their agents' strength and wits to the limit, these two elite secret organizations band together to defeat a ruthless common enemy, in order to save the world, something that's becoming a bit of a habit for Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton).—Twentieth Century Fox The film opens with Eggsy, A.K.A. Galahad (Taron Egerton) stepping out of the Kingsman tailor shop on Saville Row in London. He is approached by former Kingsman recruit gone rogue Charlie Hesketh (Edward Holcroft). He holds a gun at Eggsy and forces him into a Kingsman taxi cab while Charlie's accomplices are close behind them. As they are riding away, Eggsy and Charlie begin to fight. Charlie uses his mechanical right arm to try and get at Eggsy while Eggsy tries to use the poison blade in his shoe. Charlie cuts the blade off and it hits the cab driver, killing him. Eggsy causes the cab to crash so that Charlie goes flying through the windshield with his arm getting ripped off.With the help of Merlin (Mark Strong), Eggsy takes over the cab and drives away from Charlie's goons. Merlin leads Eggsy to a rendezvous point in Hyde Park just as Eggsy launches three missiles to easily take out the goons. Before the police can catch up to Eggsy, he drives the car into the lake and ends up in the sewers. Eggsy tells Merlin he needs to get to a dinner right away, and Merlin says there's a faster exit, but it involves Eggsy jumping into the raw sewage to get out. Seeing no other option, Eggsy jumps in. After he leaves, Charlie's mechanical arm hacks into the cab's computer to get information on every Kingsman agent.Eggsy makes it to his home with his blonde Swedish girlfriend, Princess Tilde (Hanna Alstrom). She joins Eggsy with his mates Brandon (Calvin Demba), Liam (Thomas Turgoose), and Jamal (Tobi Bakare) as it is Brandon's birthday. As Eggsy is set to meet Tilde's parents the next night, he asks his friends to watch his dog, JB. Brandon agrees to do so.In the next scene, we move to a rural jungle area in Cambodia called Poppy Land, which is made to look like a small 1950's style community run by an American billionaire drug lord named Poppy Adams (Julianne Moore). She claims her company has generated a substantial amount of money in revenue, but her company must be kept secret as her own drugs are hidden in standard recreational drugs like weed, coke, or heroin. Poppy meets with two of her associates, Charles (Keith Allen) and Angel (Tom Benedict Knight), in her diner. She knows that Charles has been doing business behind her back. As punishment, she sics her two robot dogs on him and makes Angel kill him by throwing him into a meat grinder. Poppy then sends Angel to her salon for a makeover. Her android worker burn off Angel's fingerprints and grind his teeth down before giving him a circular tattoo made from pure gold. When Angel returns to the diner, Poppy serves him a burger made from Charles's meat. Angel reluctantly eats it out of fear that he'll suffer a similar fate.In London, Eggsy meets with the new Arthur (Michael Gambon) and Roxy, AKA Lancelot (Sophie Cookson). They debrief the other Kingsmen on Charlie, and how he lost his arm and vocal chords after Eggsy electrocuted the implant he had in his neck (the same ones that made everyone's heads explode in the previous Kingsman film). They observe the golden circle tattoo that he has as well, indicating he is working for Poppy's organization.That evening, Eggsy has dinner with Tilde and her parents, the King and Queen of Sweden (Bjorn Granath and Lena Endre). Although the King is a bit stuffy toward Eggsy at first, he warms up to him when Eggsy provides spot-on analyses for topics he's questioned on. This is all thanks to Roxy feeding him information through his glasses. Eggsy makes sure to let Roxy know she's the best.Meanwhile, Brandon goes to Eggsy's place to take care of JB. He comes across Eggsy's stash of gadgets and ends up connecting to Eggsy's glasses camera. Eggsy sees Brandon picking up the lighter hand grenade and activating it. Eggsy screams at Brandon to turn it off (making it look like he's shouting at the King), and Brandon does so. However, moments later, missiles start coming down on the Kingsman headquarters. Brandon, the dog JB, Roxy, and Arthur are all killed in the ensuing explosions, as are all the Kingsman agents in other areas. Eggsy is alerted to this. Poppy, who orchestrated this attack, celebrates her victory and presents Charlie with a brand new, bigger mechanical arm.Eggsy goes to find the ruins of the Kingsman headquarters. He sees a figure emerging from the darkness, only to see it's Merlin. Both accuse each other of planning the attacks as both survived, but they realize they are both innocent. Merlin brings Eggsy to a vault where they can enact the doomsday protocol. All they find is a bottle of whiskey. They decide to drink to the memory of their friends. When they finish the bottle, Eggsy sees a note on the label reading ""Distilled in Kentucky"", which the K bearing the Kingsman logo. The two figure they must head to Kentucky, USA.In Kentucky, Eggsy and Merlin arrive at a distillery where they are found by Agent Tequila (Channing Tatum). Thinking they are intruders, Tequila fights both of them until he manages to knock Merlin out and tranquilize Eggsy. When they wake up, Tequila interrogates them, believing they are working for an enemy, despite saying they are Kingsmen. Tequila then reveals to them that they are keeping Harry Hart (Colin Firth), revealed to be alive and well, in a padded room, to the complete shock of Eggsy and Merlin. Tequila threatens to shoot Harry if they don't talk, until a woman named Ginger Ale (Halle Berry) enters and tells Tequila that Eggsy and Merlin's stories check out. Tequila apologizes and allows the two to enter the room to see Harry. When they approach him, however, Harry doesn't remember who they are, nor that he was a Kingsman.Eggsy and Merlin join Tequila and Ginger at the headquarters for their organization, the Statesmen. Ginger explains to the guys that after Harry supposedly died at the hands of Richmond Valentine, Ginger and Agent Whiskey (Pedro Pascal) arrived at the church where Valentine's super SIM cards were activated to find Harry nearly dead. Using a device called alpha gel, they were able to keep Harry alive using nanomites that repaired the damaged tissue, but also left him with retrograde amnesia. The Kingsmen then meet the head of the Statesmen, Champagne, or Champ (Jeff Bridges). They also meet Whiskey, while Ginger turns out to be the head of tech support like Merlin. The agents are all debriefed on Poppy's organization, The Golden Circle. They learn that Charlie's ex-girlfriend Clara (Poppy Delevignge) is in contact with him, and that she will be at the Glastonbury Music Festival where they may find her.At Poppy Land, we see that she's keeping Elton John (more or less playing himself) as a prisoner, forcing him to perform music for her. She notices that his face is covered in a blue rash, meaning he's been taking her drugs. Elton says he did drugs with Angel, leading Poppy to send her robo-dogs after Angel and tear him in half. The robo-dogs run to Elton, but they are programmed to view him as a friend.The same blue vein-like rash appears on Tequila's face, forcing him to sit the mission out.At the Glastonbury Music Festival, Eggsy and Whiskey go undercover to find Clara and plant a tiny condom-shaped tracking device on her. After Whiskey fails to hit on her, Eggsy steps in. The two go to Clara's tent where she wants to have sex with Eggsy. Feeling nervous, Eggsy calls Tilde to see if it's okay with her that he sleeps with Clara for the sake of the mission. Unsurprisingly, Tilde is NOT okay with it, and she stops speaking to him. Eggsy tries to turn Clara down until he sees the Golden Circle tattoo on her back. He gets her on the bed and he manages to slip her the tracking device... by fingering her. With that, he leaves the tent, feeling too guilty to cheat on Tilde.Meanwhile at Statesman Headquarters, Merlin and Ginger attempt to cure Harry's amnesia by triggering a traumatic memory from his past. They fill his room with water as they did with the Kingsman training, but Harry is terrified and they drain the water before he drowns. Eggsy later brings in a Yorkshire Terrier puppy that resembles Harry's deceased dog Mr. Pickle. Eggsy grabs a gun and acts as if he will shoot the puppy, which effectively triggers Harry's memories and brings him back.With his memories recovered, Harry joins Eggsy, Merlin, and Whiskey in a bar as they look over some new gadgets. Harry is given special glasses since he is missing an eye after getting shot. Just then, a homophobic redneck then approaches the agents and harasses them to leave. Harry locks up the bar in an attempt to do the same bad-ass fight when he first met Eggsy, but his coordination is off (mostly that he only has one eye), and he gets knocked down despite getting some good hits in. Whiskey joins the fight by using his lasso and whip gadgets to take out all the rednecks. Moments later, a message from Poppy is broadcast on TV. She reveals that her drug is among all the standard recreational drugs, and she demonstrates its effects using her test subjects. The first stage is the blue rash, followed by mania causing users to dance wildly, before they fall into paralysis, and ultimately suffer a nasty death with their eyes popping and blood pouring from their noses. Poppy does show that she has an antidote, which she uses on Elton. She demands to the President of the United States (Bruce Greenwood) that he end the War on Drugs and absolve her and her organization of their crimes once the antidote is given out.We see the President talking to his Chief of Staff, Miss Fox (Emily Watson) and General McCoy (Mark Arnold). He has no intentions to give into Poppy's demands and would rather see to it that all drug abusers be eradicated. At the same time, news anchors around the world discuss Poppy, with one of her Harvard professors saying she exhibited signs of a serious mental illness.Eggsy, Harry, and Whiskey head to Italy where Poppy's factory holding the antidote is so that they can recover some for Tequila, who has since been put in cryostasis after Poppy's broadcast. Eggsy and Whiskey ride a sky-way up to the factory where Eggsy manages to swipe a vial of antidote before being spotted by Charlie and Clara. Charlie chases after him, but he and Whiskey get away. However, Charlie messes with the sky-way after Eggsy implies he slept with Clara. The sky-way car goes down, but Eggsy and Whiskey ride it down a mountain before it crashes into a retirement home.The agents are hiding in their cabin when some of Poppy's henchmen come down and start shooting. Whiskey accidentally knocks the antidote out of Eggsy's hand, shattering it. Whiskey proceeds to go out and kill the henchmen, but Harry becomes skeptical of the man's true intentions. After all the henchmen are killed, Harry shoots Whiskey in the head, accusing him of being in league with the villains. Eggsy applies the alpha gel to Whiskey's head. Just as they plan to head back up to the factory to get more antidote, Charlie blows it up with Clara inside. The only lead they have is the name of the man who was supposed to pick up the antidote and bring it to Singapore.Eggsy gets a Facetime call from Tilde, only to discover she has the blue rash after smoking a joint, and she is already in the mania stage before becoming paralyzed mid-call. Eggsy tells Tilde he loves her and promises to save her.The President effectively quarantines every affected citizen, including Fox, leaving them in containers as some are already succumbing to the effects and dying. We even see Liam has been infected after smoking crystal meth, leaving Jamal worried alongside him.Eggsy, Merlin, and Harry all head to Poppy Land to stop Poppy once and for all. Before they can get closer, Eggsy steps on a land mine. Merlin manages to freeze the trigger briefly, but he pushes Eggsy off and stands in his place. Seeing no way out, Merlin tells Eggsy and Harry to go on ahead without him as Poppy's guards close in on them. The guards outside the main gate see Merlin as he goes out singing his favorite song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"". He steps off the mine, killing himself and the guards, and Eggsy and Harry both watch.Back at Statesman HQ, Ginger brings Whiskey's memories back by showing him a picture of his deceased wife. Whiskey then tells Ginger to get him a plane so he can meet up with the agents.Back in Cambodia, Eggsy and Harry enter Poppy Land and begin fighting her henchmen in a climatic shootout. Charlie goes out with a briefcase containing the codes to release the antidote. Harry kills the henchmen while Eggsy and Charlie fight. At the same time, Elton manages to kick some ass by fighting Poppy's goons while dressed in a fabulous feathered outfit. Poppy sics her two robo-dogs on Harry, and she reprograms them to kill Elton when he tells Poppy to fuck herself. Harry and Elton manage to destroy one robo-dog with a bowling ball. Charlie puts his new arm to good use, but Eggsy still outsmarts him. After taking out the mechanical arm, Eggsy beats Charlie in a one-armed fight. He then tells Charlie the names of all the people who have died because of him and Poppy (Roxy, Brandon, JB, and Merlin) before Eggsy snaps his neck. Harry then outruns the last robo-dog and kills it by pouring molten gold on it.Eggsy and Harry enter the diner to confront Poppy. She refuses to give up the codes until Eggsy sticks her with a needle filled with her tainted heroin. Harry states that Merlin managed to make the drug speed up the process, so she will die faster. Defeated and disoriented, Poppy gives up the code, ""VivaLasVegan"", before finally dying. Before Harry can put in the code, he is grabbed by Whiskey's lasso. Turns out Harry was right about Whiskey being a bad guy. However, instead of working for Poppy or the president, Whiskey acts on his vendetta against drug users since his wife was killed in a crossfire when two meth-heads shot up a convenience store. Eggsy and Harry fight Whiskey in another hand-to-hand combat fight before they both throw him into the meat grinder. Harry then enters the codes and sends the antidotes out.All of the victims are saved, including Tilde, Tequila, and Liam. Fox manages to have the President impeached and incarcerated for trying to effectively commit genocide.Eggsy and Harry return to Statesman HQ. Champ tells the that they acquired a distillery in Scotland to help rebuild Kingsman HQ. Without an Agent Whiskey, Champ offers the position to the guys since they can't both be Galahad, but Ginger submits her name for consideration. All the Statesmen vote for her acceptance.Eggsy marries Tilde in a royal ceremony. His friends, mother, and Harry are all in attendance.In the final shot, back in London, we see Agent Tequila in London arriving at the Kingsman tailor shop."
Blade Runner 2049,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Young Blade Runner K's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former Blade Runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years. Thirty years after the events of Blade Runner (1982), a new Blade Runner, L.A.P.D. Officer ""K"" (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos. K's discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former L.A.P.D. Blade Runner, who has been missing for thirty years.—Warner Bros. Pictures Los Angeles, 2049. With idealistic scientist Niander Wallace now in control of the powerful Tyrell Corporation, the innovative, bio-engineered Nexus-9 replicants seem to have integrated into society. As a result, outdated Nexus models threaten the community. Now, the latest generation of bounty hunters is on a crucial mission: seek and destroy the rebellious androids. And as LAPD's Officer K stumbles upon a dangerous secret hidden in plain sight, the taciturn agent must piece the evidence together to locate a ghost, the most vital element in this knotty case. However, is K destined to find the truth and the long-lostBlade Runner (1982)?—Nick Riganas Rick Deckard has vanished. The notorious Blade Runner has been missing since 2019 when he and Rachael escaped from the authorities, and in the process, also avoided the economic and social downfalls of the early 2020s. It's now 2049. Replicants are now closer to humans than ever before, and Blade Runners are still used to ""retire"" the older models that went into hiding from the notorious ""Blackout"" of 2022. In Deckard's place, ""K"" has taken the mantle of Los Angeles' top Blade Runner. However, his world turns upside down when he discovers a box.—Johnny 2049. It's been approximately two decades since the Tyrell Corporation, the creators and original manufacturers of replicants (bioengineered superhumans), went bankrupt, a new generation of replicants manufactured by industrialist Niander Wallace who saved the world with his replicants in establishing synthetic farming in light of collapsing natural ecosystems. While the replicants of the Tyrell era are now outlawed in they having violently rebelled, they ""retired"" (aka destroyed) by blade runners, the Wallace era replicants, which have been programmed to obey, are seen as necessary to society. Many current day blade runners are Wallace era replicants. K, short for his serial number KD6-3.7, is one such blade runner working for the LAPD under Lieutenant Joshi. On one of his assignments, K discovers what he believes are human remains, but on forensic examination are actually the remains of a female replicant who has signs of having given birth during her life, presumably to a human baby. Joshi, fearing the worst of what this finding actually means and it getting into the wrong hands, orders K to discover and destroy any evidence of this finding, which includes locating the baby, probably now grown, and destroying him/her. As K discovers some further evidence to this story concerning his own history (each replicant which is implanted with a manufactured and thus not real history), K begins to suspect that this story may be a little more than just a professional assignment to him and which may jeopardize his future beyond that information getting into the wrong hands with which he will also have to deal.—Huggo The story opens in 2049, thirty years after the events of the first film. An on-screen text states that the Tyrell Corporation has collapsed decades before, in the wake of violent revolts involving their Nexus-6 through -8 Replicants, forcing the company into bankruptcy. After the world's ecosystems collapsed in the mid 2020s, famine swept the Earth, killing millions. With his invention of synthetic farming, a wealthy businessman named Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) ended food shortages and acquired Tyrell's remaining assets to form his own corporation. The Wallace Company has reinvigorated the Replicant industry by mass producing the Nexus-9 Replicants, a new generation of artificial humans with modified behavior to make them more obedient than the older models. These Replicants have implanted memories and open-ended lifespans, and are still used for slave labor on the off-world colonies (the Moon, Mars, and the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, etc.), but some are also used as Blade Runner units, hunting down and ""retiring"" (i.e. killing) the few remaining older model Replicants that are still at large.In the opening scene, Agent K (Ryan Gosling), one of these Nexus-9 Replicants, travels to a protein farm outside Los Angeles in his flying Spinner vehicle, where he has tracked down an older model Replicant called Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), who is part of a group of Series 8 Replicants that have gone AWOL. Morton tries to fool K by playing dumb, but his satchel betrays that he is a combat model from the battle of Calantha. After a brief but violent fight, Morton chastizes K for killing his own kind and doing the humans' dirty jobs because he has never witnessed the kind of ""miracle"" that he has. K retires him and takes his eye for identification. He is just ready to leave when he notices a flower placed beside a dead tree in the desolate landscape next to the farm. The tree is supported by wires, so someone has gone through some lengths to preserve it. This prompts him to thoroughly scan the area, which reveals a chest buried in the ground under the tree. He requests his office to send a forensic team to unearth it.K returns to the LAPD office, where he undergoes a standard 'baseline test' for Replicants and passes it. He then goes home to his apartment in a seedy area of town, enduring a lot of abuse from neighbors for being a ""skinjob"". He spends his time at home with a holographic woman named Joi (Ana de Armas), a futuristic form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and has apparently formed a deep bond with her, despite the fact that they cannot physically interact. For this reason, he has bought her a mobile hologram projector which allows him to free her program from its home-based console. He can now take Joi outside on the top of his apartment building in the pouring rain, and it also allows her program to touch objects. Joi is extremely happy, but K is called back to the station before they can experiment with Joi's new capabilities any further.Downtown, the Forensics team has discovered that the chest contains a human skeleton and a lock of hair. They belong to a female who most likely had complications during childbirth 30 years before. Superficial cuts in the bones suggest an emergency Cesarean section as the cause of death. Upon closer inspection, K locates a serial number engraved on one of the woman's bones, indicating that the skeleton wasn't from a human, but a Replicant female. The identification causes quite a stir since Replicants were previously unable to reproduce. K's superior, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), reminds him that if the public knew that the line that separates humans from Replicants is blurring, or disappearing altogether, it would tear apart what remains of civilization. She commands the team to destroy the evidence, and orders K to burn down the farm, track down the Replicant child, and retire it, despite the mixed feelings he may have about retiring something that was born - and has a soul. Before leaving, K takes some of the female Replicant's hair.K goes to the Wallace Company to inquire about the serial number and hair of the female Replicant. It is housed in the old Tyrell pyramid, although now much more austerely lit. A clerk tells him that the number belongs to an older model Replicant; information may be hard to find, given the fact that an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) event called the 'Blackout' in 2022 destroyed almost every digital file the company had before that date. All that remains is some raw hard-copy data, but fortunately, there appears to be something left. K is helped by a Replicant woman called Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), who gives him access to what appears to be an old memory file containing an audio recording. It belonged to an experimental Replicant named Rachael, who went missing 30 years before. She can be heard talking to a Blade Runner called Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). K detects a very strong connection between the two. Luv thanks K for finally being able to close the case on Rachael.K does some research on Deckard, and finds his old colleague Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who is now living in a retirement home. Gaff tells him that Deckard and Rachel fell in love, and eloped. K asks if Gaff knew that Deckard would one day leave society; Gaff confirms, saying that there was something in Deckard's eyes that told him he was finished hunting Replicants.Luv reports what she has learned to Wallace, who is blind but can see with the help of small drones. He is just witnessing the activation of a new female Replicant, which looks a lot like a crude birthing from a gestation bag. He muses sympathetically to his creation how he was able to make new Replicants who have helped colonize nine worlds, yet he shares his frustration about that small number, stating that humanity should ""own the stars"". He poses that every leap of civilization was done with the aid of a disposable workforce, and Replicants have replaced slaves in that matter, but his production capacity for them is limited. He laments that the female Replicant cannot bear children, and carelessly slashes the woman's abdomen. In order to conquer the stars, millions more Replicants will be necessary, but he cannot get them to procreate, despite all his efforts. Tyrell obviously learned how to do this, but this technique was lost, and the only way to learn Tyrell's secrets is to find Rachael's child. He commands Luv (who is emotionally shaken by his actions but remains obedient) to obtain Rachael's remains and follow K to locate the child.Meanwhile, K is walking through the city's entertainment district to buy dinner, where a mysteriously cloaked woman commands three Replicant prostitutes to find out what he knows. One of them, Mariette (Mackenzie Davis), tries to seduce him for sex, but noticing he carries a holographic projector, she figures that he is not into ""real girls"", and leaves. In the meantime, Luv has entered the police station to retrieve Rachael's remains, coldly killing the forensic agent who discovers her doing it.K returns to Sapper's farm and locates a hidden box, containing a baby sock and a picture of another woman holding the baby in front of the tree, implying that Sapper and several other Replicants have been protecting Rachael's secret for decades. He also finds a date carved into the bottom of the tree, 6-10-21, which visibly upsets him. He burns the farm and returns to LA. Reporting his findings to Joshi, she tells him about the death of their forensic colleague and the disappearance of Rachael's remains, and asks him about his most precious childhood memory. Even though he knows that it must be an implanted one, K says that he clearly remembers being chased through an old factory as a kid by a group of older boys. They wanted to take away his wooden carving of a horse, so he hid it inside an old furnace. K remembers that the horse had a date on it, the exact same date that was carved into the tree, a fact that he doesn't share with Joshi. Joshi suggests he try the DNA bank to identify the child.Assuming that the date carved in the tree and the horse is meant to be a date of birth, K starts to dig into the DNA bank to find someone born on June 10, 2021. Again, only raw data remains, but he finds records of two children born that day, a boy and a girl. They have the same DNA... which is an impossibility (only identical twins can have the same DNA, and they should have the same gender). The DNA data came from an orphanage outside the city where the girl later died from a genetic disease, so K suspects that the data from the girl is a fake copy of the other. He theorizes that the surviving boy may have been hidden by the Replicants in the orphanage, which is in the ruins of San Diego.He travels there in his Spinner but is shot down by a tribe of feral scavengers who live among the ruins of a massive old ship breaking yard. They try to attack him, but Luv, who is keeping an eye on him from above through remote drone surveillance, uses precision bombs to repel them. After repairing the damage to his spinner, K proceeds to the orphanage, an old, overturned telescope dish, where the caretaker (Lennie James) is clearly using the children as cheap laborers. He coerces the man into showing him the old administrative files, but finds that the sections he is looking for have been completely torn out. While exiting, he notices how familiar the surroundings feel to him. He walks deeper into the ship section, and is shocked to find the location and the furnace from his memory; the wooden horse is still hidden inside it. K returns to the LAPD station in an upset state for another baseline test, which does not go smoothly.Not knowing what to make of the revelation, he returns home. Joi is convinced that this means that his childhood memory is real, and K is Rachael's son, suggesting he was born instead of manufactured, and that he has a soul, as opposed to other Replicants who are thought to be 'soulless' and thus inferior to humans. She thinks he deserves a human name, and starts to call him 'Joe'. K is still not convinced that the memory is real, so Joi suggests that he should contact an expert on implanted memories.K arrives at the lab of Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri), a freelance designer who creates memory implants for Wallace's Replicants. Dr. Stelline is happy to see someone, being kept inside a dome at all times since she suffers from a compromised immune system, and can't be exposed to other people. Her parents left Earth for one of the off-world colonies, but she wasn't allowed to come along because of her disease. Her youth was lonely, but this caused her imagination to flourish, making her one of the best creators of artificial memories, since using real memories is illegal. K asks how fake memories can be discerned from real ones. Dr. Stelline says that fake memories tend to be too detailed, since real memories are 'messy' as they tend to reflect an emotional rather than a photographic recollection; but a good fabricated memory always contains something personal of the artist. K asks her to take a look at his memory, and give her thoughts. A special device allows Dr. Stelline to see the memory inside his head. Overcome by emotion, she says that ""someone has lived this""; K leaves in a fit of anger and confusion. As he goes outside, he is apprehended by the police.K is confronted by an angered Joshi for hanging around a facility where he has no business being, and failing his last baseline test, which is normally reason for immediate retirement. K tells her that he is in his current state because he succeeded in his mission: he has killed Rachael's offspring, who was so well-hidden that even the man didn't know who he was. Joshi agrees that this is a valid reason for a failed baseline test, so she suspends him, giving him 48 hours to get his emotions under control, because his next baseline test will be out of her control. Going home, he finds Mariette in his room. Joi reassures him that this is her doing, because she needs Mariette for something. She synchronizes her holographic program with Mariette, so she is able to steer Mariette's body and make love to K. The next morning, K takes a shower and clearly feels awkward about the unexpected threesome, while Mariette places a tracking device in his coat. As she notices the wooden horse, Joi appears and tells Mariette to leave; Mariette scoffs that, having been inside Joi's consciousness, she noticed that not much was there (showing that Replicants are not above feelings of superiority either).K tells Joi that people will be coming for him, so he needs to go. Joi insists that he take her and delete her program from the home-based projector completely, so that her memory files cannot be used to find him; K is reluctant, as transferring her solely to the mobile projector puts her at risk of being lost if it gets damaged, but he ultimately agrees. He destroys the antenna in the projector so that she cannot be moved to another device, thereby also removing any chance of tracking it. Luv, who is monitoring the position of the projector, is no longer able to track K.K takes the wooden horse to a specialist, Doc Badger (Barkhad Abdi), who finds traces of radioactive tritium in the wood. They deduce that there is only one area nearby that can account for the type of wood and such high radiation readings. K leaves the city, taking care not to be noticed.K arrives in the abandoned ruins of Las Vegas and finds a beehive, indicating that there must be people in the abandoned area. He enters a deserted hotel/casino, and judging by the booby traps, he figures he is in the right place. It doesn't take long for Deckard to show himself, keeping K at gunpoint in the supposition that he is there to kill him. They fight for a while before Deckard becomes convinced that K is only there for answers, so he invites him for a drink.In the meanwhile, Luv has arrived at K's apartment, disappointed to find that he is gone and that the mobile projector can no longer be tracked. She proceeds to the police station, asking Joshi to cooperate and tell her where K is. Joshi refuses, telling her that K succeeded and fled after killing the Replicant child. Luv's initially friendly disposition changes drastically, hissing in anger that they killed a wonder out of fear for a change that is inevitable anyway. She tortures Joshi for information, but to no avail. Luv tells Joshi that contrary to what she may believe, Replicants are capable of lying, so K may not have told her the truth. Getting no more cooperation, Luv kills Joshi and uses her computer to locate K in Las Vegas.Deckard tells K that Las Vegas used to be a sprawling center of amusement, until a dirty bomb made it unlivable for decades. After initial hesitation, he confirms that Rachael was pregnant, but he has never seen the child, nor does he know its whereabouts. Deckard was still actively hunted, so out of love for her and the child, he left a still-pregnant Rachael in the care of people who could protect her. He taught the other Replicants how to scramble records and cover their tracks, but after the Blackout, so much information was lost that not even Deckard could have found the child if he wanted to. He never tried, hoping that his ignorance was the best way to keep everyone safe; if the wrong people had followed him, the child would be dissected: ""Sometimes to love someone, you've got to be a stranger."" Deckard is done answering questions about this painful subject.After a while, Deckard notices that someone has entered the area. Convinced that K has been followed, they proceed to Deckard's Spinner to flee, but a rocket grenade destroys the Spinner and incapacitates both Deckard and K. Luv enters with a few henchmen, and although K dispatches some of them, Luv fights back and badly injures him. She notices K's mobile projector and destroys it, effectively killing Joi, to K's anguish. Leaving him for dead, she kidnaps Deckard and takes him back to Wallace.Fading in and out of consciousness for a time, K's wounds are tended by a group of Replicants including Mariette, who have found him through her tracker. When he finally wakes up, he learns they are part of a Replicant freedom movement. Their leader, Freysa (Hiam Abbass), is the woman in the picture holding Rachael's baby, and the one who sent Mariette onto K. She is an old battle comrade of Sapper from Calantha, and she reveals how she was there when the living miracle of Rachael's child was born. Rachael herself died in childbirth, so the rebellious Replicants went to great lengths to hide the baby and keep it a secret; Sapper actually died to protect it. Because if Replicants could have children, the human world could no longer deny them their rights and freedoms, so they have built an army for the coming revolution. No individual - K, Freysa or Deckard - is more important than this cause, and dying for it is the most human thing they can do. Since Deckard is in Wallace's hands now, K needs to kill him to prevent Deckard from giving information that will lead them to Freysa; in fact, she is convinced that Deckard would happily sacrifice his life for his daughter, who will be shown to the world and lead their army when the time is right.K gets confused, stating that the lost child was a boy, since he found evidence that a girl died in the orphanage and a boy was hidden there; Freysa answers enigmatically that this is ""just a piece of the puzzle"", and that she witnessed the girl being born. Thinking back on all he has discovered so far, K is flooded with a series of memories: Dr. Ana Stelline saying how she always puts something of herself into her work; her emotional response to his memory, stating that it was real and not fabricated; the DNA readouts, one real, one fake; Deckard telling him how he taught the Replicants to scramble records and cover their tracks; the memory of the child hiding the wooden horse. Suddenly, all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place: Dr. Stelline is Rachael and Deckard's lost daughter; the implanted memory about the wooden horse was not fabricated because it was hers, and she put it in other Replicants as well. Freysa notes K's apprehension, realizing that he believed he was Deckard's and Rachael's child; she comforts him by saying that every Replicant wishes they were, and that it is the reason they believe.At the Wallace Company, Deckard wakes up inside Wallace's office, who is happy to finally meet him. He shows him Rachael's skull, calling it the lock and Deckard the key to unraveling the mystery of Replicant reproduction; however, it has been insufficient, and he really needs Deckard's child to create his self-perpetuating army of slaves. He starts an audio playback of Deckard's first conversation with Rachael, which emotionally affects him. Wallace insinuates that their instant connection wasn't coincidence: their first meeting was set up from the beginning, with the intention that they would end up together and reproduce; either because Deckard himself is a Replicant, or because Rachael was designed to his preferences with mathematical precision. Wallace praises Deckard for keeping himself empty of the information that could lead them to the child, but he can still name the people who helped him and the places they visited. He tries to entice Deckard with something that he really covets: a woman walks in from the shadows, and she appears to be an exact copy of Rachael as she appeared to Deckard 30 years ago, down to the clothing and hairstyle she wore. Deckard is shocked and moved, but through the emotional anguish and against all his instincts, he ultimately dismisses this Rachael as a fake, stating that the real one had green eyes. Frustrated by his failure, Wallace immediately has Luv execute the fake Rachael. He orders Luv to take Deckard to one of the off-world colonies, where they have people experienced in torture with the means to make him talk.K finds himself back in LA, observing a giant three-dimensional ad for the Joi hologram with great sorrow, knowing that the Joi he loved is gone forever. In the meanwhile, Luv takes off with a hand-cuffed Deckard in a Spinner with two escorting vehicles, and flies along the LA shoreline. K catches up, using his Spinner to destroy the escorts and blow Luv's vehicle from the sky, forcing it to crash onto the beach. K lands next to it and after an exchange of gunshots that kills the pilots, he gets into a fight with Luv. He receives severe wounds from Luv's relentless punches and knife, and Luv leaves him for dead. She re-enters the vehicle, trying to free Deckard from his cuffs as the Spinner is being dragged into the sea by tidal waves, but then K enters. He fights with Luv and pushes her down under water with all of his power, finally drowning the life out of her. He manages to release Deckard just before the vehicle sinks completely. Deckard says that he should have let him die; K states that he did: the world will believe that Deckard went down with the vehicle.K takes Deckard to Dr. Stelline's office. He tells him he is free to meet his daughter now, and that all his best memories are hers. Deckard asks him: ""Why? Who am I to you?""; K simply urges him to enter the office. As Deckard goes in and meets his unsuspecting daughter who is enjoying a cloud of artificial snow, K lays down on the steps outside, slowly succumbing to his wounds. He looks at the real snow falling down, apparently at peace with the part he played."
John Wick: Chapter 2,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4425200/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life. Bound by an inescapable blood debt to the Italian crime lord, Santino D'Antonio, and with his precious 1969 Mustang still stolen, John Wick--the taciturn and pitiless assassin who thirsts for seclusion--is forced to visit Italy to honour his promise. But, soon, the Bogeyman will find himself dragged into an impossible task in the heart of Rome's secret criminal society, as every killer in the business dreams of cornering the legendary Wick who now has an enormous price on his head.

As he drives away, a number of Abram's men attack John. His car is seriously damaged when the henchmen crash into his car, but Wick fights off each of the men before making his way to Abram's office. Once there, John pours Abram and himself a drink. He chooses to spare Abram and offers him peace. Abram questions John as to whether or not he can actually find peace.John returns home to the still-unnamed dog he took at the end of the first movie. He calls Aurelio (John Leguizamo) to come pick up the car, which, while drivable, is a wreck. Still, Aurelio says he will fix it. After Aurelio leaves, John reburies his weapons and gold beneath fresh cement, believing he is done with the assassin's life. He watches a video on his phone of himself and his late wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan).Later that night, John is visited by another assassin named Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio). He presents John with a marker that John gave him when he was completing the task which allowed him to leave his former life behind. The marker represents a blood oath obligating John to perform any service required by Santino. John refuses to help Santino, despite knowing the consequences. Santino leaves John's house and fetches an ARWEN 37 (standing in for a grenade launcher) to fire grenades that destroy John's house. John and the dog escape.John goes to the Continental hotel to meet with Winston (Ian McShane) to discuss the marker and what Santino has requested of him. Winston cannot do anything about it since John took the oath, and if he continues to refuse it, his life will be up for grabs. John departs and leaves the dog in the care of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick).John tracks down Santino and finally agrees to do one job for him. Santino wants John to kill his sister Gianna (Claudia Gerini), who is set to ascend to the High Table, a group of powerful assassins. John argues that this is an impossible target to which Santino replies that this is exactly why he wanted John for the task. He needed the best. Seeing no way out of it, John travels to Rome to complete the task.He stays at the Rome Continental, owned by Julius (Franco Nero). John meets with suppliers to prepare -- a tailor to buy custom, bullet-resistant lined suits, a historian to obtain maps of the catacombs, and an armorer to procure weapons.John attends a party that is Gianna's ""coronation"" and welcome to the High Table. She is accompanied by her loyal bodyguard Cassian (Common). John sneaks into Gianna's room and confronts her alone. He tells her that Santino sent him. She warns him of the events that will unfold once she is dead. She chooses to die on her own terms by slitting her wrists. Gianna lies in a pool as she dies. In honor of their past friendship, John holds her hand until she passes out. To grant his friend an honest chance at Paradise without the weight of suicide which her Catholic religion prohibits, and to claim the marker, John shoots her in the head.Cassian spots John as he is leaving. Upon learning that John is working, Cassian draws his weapon, as does John, and each shoots the other, though they are uninjured due to their bullet-resistant clothing. John runs into the catacombs where is has pre-positioned the weapons he bought earlier. He is attacked by dozens of Santino's henchmen, who intend to ""tie up loose ends"" by killing him. He realizes Santino is double-crossing him and kills everyone before he gets away.Cassian catches up to him and they fight until they crash through a window of the Rome Continental. Since no blood may be spilled on Continental grounds, John and Cassian sit at the bar and have a drink together. John explains the marker that Santino called on him to kill his sister. Cassian understands but also cannot allow his ward's killer to go unpunished. He pays for John's drink and leaves. John then spots Ares (Ruby Rose), Santino's mute bodyguard. She lets him know through sign language that she'll be seeing him. He replies in sign language that if she keeps following him, he'll end her.As John is heading back to New York City, Santino puts out a $7 million contract to kill John. The contract is distributed to all the assassins in the area. A female violinist in the subway pulls out a gun from the violin and tries to kill John, but he subdues her and breaks her neck. A heavyset Asian man goes after John and gets his brains blown out. Two men in the subway try to kill him, and John brutally kills them with a pencil. Cassian finds John as he gets on the subway and fights him in the train. John stabs Cassian and pushes the knife into his chest, piercing his aorta. He allows Cassian to live as a 'professional courtesy,' telling him that if he pulls the knife out, he will bleed to death. John leaves Cassian on the subway.Injured, John seeks out what appears to be a homeless man and asks for his help. John gives him a coin and ask to be taken to ""him"". The homeless turns kills two men dressed as janitors who are looking for John.""Him"" turns out to be the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), an assassin that once had a run-in with John and was left with a scar on his neck.

John finds Santino in the lounge. Winston knows what John is about to do and tries to calm him down. Still, John kills Santino, shooting him in the head. John returns to pick up his dog from Charon.The next day, John goes with his dog to meet with Winston at the park. Winston informs John that because he killed on Continental grounds, the High Table has doubled the contract and sent it to every assassin across the globe. Winston must mark John as excommunicado, but he gives him a one-hour lead before the contract takes effect. It then becomes evident that every single person in the park is an assassin, and they have their eyes on John. John tells Winston to let everyone know that if they go after him, he will kill them all. Winston agrees. John leaves as Winston puts the word out. Every passing person looks at John, knowing who he is and what they want from him. John is forced to take the dog and keep on running."

Since he doesn't understand Jason's metaphors and clever wordings to describe his situation, Billy reveals that he doesn't really intend for them to hang out; he needs to get somewhere that night and could use Jason's help. Jason then clarifies his house arrest to him, saying there's nothing he can do about it. Knowing how to do it, Billy offers to disable the SIM on the monitor if he goes to his house before the time the tag goes off. He also offers to lend Jason his mom's van for a few hours if he agreed to help him that night. Jason instead goes home, but after hearing his parents arguing about him, he rides his bike to Billy's house. With four minutes left, Billy calmly and carefully scrambles the SIM chip. Jason thanks Billy, and owes up to his end of the deal.The guys go by a hill where they carry a big crate of equipment that Billy wants to use in a specific location. Jason isn't comfortable with the task, as he and Billy don't know each other. Billy explains that he's on diagnosed with Spectrum. Jason asks if it's a workout program as a joke, but Billy further explains that his brain doesn't work the same as his, leaving him unable to understand humor or sarcasm, so he didn't get the joke. After he drops off Billy, Jason leaves him there. He runs into Kimberly, who is swimming in the lake. Meanwhile, another Angel Grove student, Zack Taylor (Ludi Lin), is watching the new girl, Trini (Becky G), doing yoga nearby.Jason and Kimberly talk about how much they hate Angel Grove for outcasting them just for making stupid mistakes and their wish of running away and starting new lives. Meanwhile, Billy works on digging through the wall of a hill with an explosive he built into the wall, and causes an explosion. Everyone runs to the scene. Zack and Trini meet the other three kids. Zack and Trini explain that they can't be out there as the place is restricted. Suddenly, the wall further collapses, revealing a crystalline wall behind it. On the wall are what appear to be different colored gems. Zack breaks them off. They are actually power coins with the colors red, blue, black, yellow, and pink. They each pick one up and keep them. When they hear alarms going off, the kids run for it. Jason and Billy take the van before going back to get the other three. Their path is headed in the same direction as an oncoming train. Billy thinks he can make it before the train comes, but the train slams right into the van. The van crashes, and the coins start glowing.Somewhere over the ocean, Sam, who works as a fisherman, has his men pull up a big pile of fish as a storm starts hitting. He discovers Rita's corpse among the fish.The kids all wake up in their rooms, miraculously unharmed and with enhanced strength (Jason breaks off a piece of his sink, Billy tears off the door of his tool closet, and Kimberly crushes her phone in her hand). They still have their power coins on them. At school, the bully from detention goes up to harass Billy again by trying to break his wrist, but Billy's bones don't budge. The bully then headbutts Billy, only to get knocked unconscious and have all the kids think Billy did it on his own, gaining brief popularity amongst them. Later at lunch, as he appeals to a group of kids about his amazing action, he is pulled aside by Kimberly to talk to her and Jason about their changes. When the power coins cause the lunch table to overheat, causing all the trays and food to melt or explode, they decide that they should go back to the hill to find answers.The three return to the hill and find Zack trying to break through the wall himself. They all see Trini, but she climbs up a wall to avoid the kids. They chase after her, also climbing up the hill. Kimberly tries to talk reason with her, but Trini then makes a huge leap across a crevice. The others jump after her. Billy is reluctant and afraid at first, but after the others persuade him, he jumps, but almost doesn't make it. He pulls himself up the ledge and celebrates, only to fall down the crevice. Jason calls out repeatedly for Billy, but there's no response at first, causing them to think he's dead, but then they are relieved when they hear him telling the gang to join him. Jason and Zack jump in, but Trini starts to walk away. Kimberly tricks her into coming back so she can pull her down with her.The kids all land in a body of water, and all start glowing colors underneath. They swim down to find an underground cave. They come across a ship with advanced technology in it. A small robot named Alpha-5 (Bill Hader), who's been waiting for ""them"" for the past 65 million years, finds the gang and brings them to Zordon, who now lives within the Morphing Grid to preserve his consciousness. Zordon and Alpha-5 explain to the gang that because the power coins came into their possession, they have been chosen to become the new Power Rangers. Billy is excited, but the rest of the group scoff this. To prove his point, Zordon visually introduces them to Rita and what she intends to do with the world. The group is horrified. He further tells them about Rita and how she was originally part of their team until she betrayed her fellow Rangers for control of the Zeo Crystal. She also wants to create Goldar, a gigantic golden monster that will tear apart Angel Grove to find the Crystal. Not wanting any part of this, the group leave the ship. However, Zordon stops Jason and convinces Jason to believe him. Jason then returns, surprised that the group have waited for him. He persuades them that everything they've learned in there might be true given the unexplainable changes they went through earlier that day, and, though he cannot force them to, he hopes to meet him the next day when he plans to return.Later that day, it is revealed that Zack's mother is dying as he brings her meds to her as she lies in bed. She asks Zack if he's still going to school, but Zack doesn't answer, only telling her to take her meds. In Trini's home, her parents try to get her to talk to them about her day; her mother grows immediately frustrated with her silence, but her more patient father tries to calm down the situation and tries again a little more calmer. She tells them exactly what happened. Her younger twin brothers are amazed, but her mother doesn't believe her, and orders her to urinate in a test cup to make sure she's not on drugs. Sam has a cop come onto his boat to check on the corpse they found. Tired from the long night, Sam goes home to rest and leaves the boat to the cop alone. While investigating, Rita's coin revives her, and she attacks and kills the cop.Jason goes back, and is satisfied to see that the others decided to return with him. They go into the ship, where Zordon instructs them to step into the morphing grid to morph into their armor so they can officially become the rangers, but the morphing grid fails. Zordon then instructs them to go into The Pit, where they are forced to fight against simulations of Rita's rock monster minions, the Putties. The Rangers get beat up but they continue training and try to morph, but with no luck.Rita has been devouring gold off of several victims to gather for Goldar. She makes it into town and enters a jewelry store, where she starts consuming more gold and adding it to her staff. An officer arrives and orders Rita to stand down. She creates a Puttie and has it kill the officer.In an attempt to inspire them, Alpha-5 shows them their Zords, which are huge mechas that the Rangers can control, but Alpha-5 and Zordon feel they aren't ready to use them. Zack doesn't listen and decides to take his Zord out for a joy ride. He is unable to control it and ends up running around outside the cave, nearly running into town before crashing back into the cave, nearly crashing into everyone. Jason gets angry with Zack's carelessness almost causing their lives, and the two start a fight. When Billy intervenes, the others see that he has morphed, but only temporarily. Disappointed with their lack of progress, Zordon instructs the group to leave. Jason tries to get Billy to morph again to prove their progress, but Billy is unable to. Zordon believes that they are not Rangers.As they leave, Jason goes back to the ship where he catches Zordon and Alpha-5 talking about that he can't be physically revived without the morphing grid working. Believing that they aren't destined to be Rangers and Zordon made it up for his own personal agenda, he angrily walks out on him, being done with Zordon. Zordon tries to warn Jason about Rita's threat and that the team needs to be ready for her, Jason refuses to listen.Zack sets up a campfire outside the cave and invites the gang to hang with him. They decide to open up and get to know each other because they feel that's why they're not morphing. Zack starts and discusses his ailing mother while expressing his fears over what will happen to him if something happens to her. Billy then opens up about him not missing his deceased father, as other than going to the mines with him, they never really had much of a relationship outside of that. When Jason asks, Billy reveals that the reason he was in detention was because he blew up his lunch box resulting from a failed experiment. Kimberly skips her turn, so Trini talks about how she's moved around a lot regarding personal issues. She reveals that she's secretly question her sexual orientation, and is too afraid to open up to her stereotypically normal parents, who are already having a hard time accepting her without knowing. Jason acknowledges how people had seen him and how people may see him now as a result of his mistakes.Rita attacks Trini in her bedroom. She taunts her with the fact that she killed the last Yellow Ranger. Trini and Rita fight for a bit, but Rita overpowers Trini. She asks Trini where her crystal is. Trini doesn't know, and Rita believes her. She demands her to follow her orders.Kimberly goes to Jason's house and admits to him why she was really in detention. The main reason was because she punched her boyfriend's tooth out, but that was because he called Kimberly the meanest person ever. The reason for THAT was because Amanda, Kimberly's previously seen friend, sent her an explicit picture in confidence, only for Kimberly to spread that picture to her boyfriend, who would also spread that picture around to everyone else at school. When confronted about it in the office, she was faced with the guilt of being there when the photo was shown to Amanda and her father. She thinks it's her fault that they aren't morphing. Jason tells her to move on from that, as this one foolish action doesn't define her as a person.Trini tells everybody to meet them at the docks. She tells everybody about her incident with Rita, and Jason reveals what he learned from Zordon. He then decides to stop Rita anyway with various tools lying around, only for Rita to amush them all. She knows that Billy knows where the Crystal is. He discovered earlier that the Crystal lies beneath none other than...a Krispy Kreme. Rita heads off to find the Crystal but sends Billy underwater with some of her deadly energy from her staff. The others free themselves from their binds and try to pull Billy out. They try to revive him, but he is already dead.The four carry Billy's body to the cave. Jason tries to get Zordon to revive him, but without the morphing grid working, Zordon is unable to. Jason expresses his sorrow and feelings that he failed Billy and his friends. The rest of the group lament, saying that it all should've been them instead of Billy, since Billy was the most innocent of them. The Morphing Grid then activates, giving Zordon an opportunity to come back with his own body. After a brief moment, Zordon's face disappears from the wall. It then returns, and Alpha-5 asks Zordon why he didn't come back. He says only one may return. Billy then wakes up, to the delight of his friends. Now that he sees they can work together as a team, Zordon tells the Rangers to step onto their pads. They finally morph into their suits and head off to stop Rita.The Putties attack the Rangers outside the cave as Rita is in the process of creating Goldar. The rock monsters outnumber the Rangers, so they hop in their Zords and beat them before heading into town. Goldar is already destroying Angel Grove to find the Crystal. The Rangers head in and fight Goldar separately. Jason spots his father caught up in the chaos and he goes to rescue him, not revealing who he is. Goldar takes down Kimberly's jet and knocks the other Zords into each other. Goldar then starts to push the Rangers into a fiery pit as they start to accept their fates. Goldar knocks them all in, but they suddenly join their Zords together to create the Mega-Zord.Rita finds the Krispy Kreme and has Goldar tear it down to get the Crystal. However, the Rangers use the Mega-Zord to fight Goldar. Rita then lets Goldar absorb her so that she may give the creature more power. The Rangers overpower Goldar and use their giant swords to destroy the monster. The gold melts off Rita and she faces the Rangers. Jason orders her to surrender so that they may take her to be judged by Zordon. Rita refuses and she leaps to attack the Rangers. The Mega-Zord simply smacks Rita into outer space where she is frozen. A crowd of citizens (including the original Green and Pink Rangers - Jason David Frank and Amy Jo Johnson) gather in awe of the Rangers.The town recognizes the Rangers as their mysterious saviors. Sam hangs an article of their heroics on his fridge, implying he knows Jason is one of them. As the Rangers continue their regular lives, Trini is forced to repair the walls of her bedroom as a punishment, Zordon's voice narrates over as he expresses gratitude to the five friends for carrying on the legacy of the Power Rangers.In a mid-credits scene, the teacher in detention is calling for Tommy Oliver, but he is not there. Moments later, Billy's locker blows up as a result of another one of his experiments."

However, an unfortunate run-in with a busy golden bee will send the immense but peaceful animal back to the old Casa del Toro academy, where the famous matador, El Primero, usually selects his worthy bovine opponents for the arena. Does Ferdinand hide a fierce champion underneath a mountain of muscles, or is he a gentle giant after all?—Nick Riganas Young Ferdinand does not enjoy butting heads with other young bulls, preferring instead to lie under a cork tree smelling the flowers. His mother is concerned that he might be lonely and tries to persuade him to play with the other calves, but when she sees that Ferdinand is content as he is, she leaves him alone.. A male bull who lives with a family is taken away from his home.

Determined to return to his family, he rallies a misfit team for the ultimate adventure. Set in Spain, Ferdinand proves you can't judge a bull by its cover. This animated film based on a popular children's books, opens in Spain, on a bull-training ranch called Casa Del Toro. Three young calves wait to see which of the older bulls will get picked to fight a matador. Little Ferdinand (voice of Colin H. Murphy) tends to a rose that he has planted in the field. He gets picked on by the other calves, but mostly by Valiente (voice of Jack Gore), and his buddies Guapo (voice of Jet Jurgensmeyer) and Bones (voice of Nile Diaz). The calves watch as the older bulls, which include Ferdinand and Valiente's fathers, start to fight for victory. The matador chooses Ferdinand's dad (voice of Jeremy Sisto). The bull says goodbye to his son, while Valiente's own dad coldly dismisses him. Valiente then stomps on Ferdinand's flower out of spite.Later on, Ferdinand sees the truck that took his dad come back, but he's not in it. Ferdinand realizes something must have happened to him. Heartbroken, Ferdinand runs away from the ranch and escapes his captors until he ends up lost. He is found by a florist named Juan (voice of Juanes) and his dog Paco (voice of Jerrod Carmichael). They bring Ferdinand home to Juan's daughter Nina (Lily Day), who immediately forms a bond with Ferdinand when she sees that he loves flowers. Nina raises Ferdinand as her pet and best friend, to Paco's annoyance.Ferdinand (now voiced by John Cena) grows into a very big bull, but is still gentle and friendly. He thinks of Paco like a brother, but the dog won't admit it despite his tail wagging whenever Ferdinand calls him a brother.Juan and Nina are preparing to go to an annual flower festival in town, but they can't bring Ferdinand because he's too big. After they leave, Ferdinand decides on his own to go to the flower festival anyway. When he gets into town, the other people are scared when they see him walking around. Nina sees him and is excited, until Ferdinand gets stung on the butt by a bee, causing him to yell in pain and make the others think he's attacking. He runs around in a panicked frenzy, alerting authorities. He hides in a china shop (of all places) and nearly evades capture until he sneezes and makes a mess. Ferdinand gets taken in, and Nina sadly watches him go.Ferdinand is brought back to Casa Del Toro where he meets a coaching goat named Lupe (voice of Kate McKinnon). She takes him to the bulls he knew as calves, now all grown up. In addition to Valiente (now voiced by Bobby Cannavale), Guapo (now voiced by Peyton Manning), and Bones (now played by Anthony Anderson), there is the Scottish bull Angus (voice of David Tennant) who can't see past the hair blocking his eyes and the quiet but tough Maquina (voice of Tim Nordquist), who is said to have been made in a lab. Guapo and Bones are surprised by how much Ferdinand has grown, but Valiente is still a jerk who wants to fight and beat Ferdinand.Lupe brings Ferdinand to his stable where he meets three mischievous hedgehogs - Una (voice of Gina Rodriguez), Dos (voice of Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (voice of Gabriel Iglesias). Although Ferdinand frightens them at first, he shows he is a nice guy, and they warm up to him. Ferdinand also later meets three snooty German horses - Hans (voice of Flula Borg), Greta (voice of Sally Phillips), and Klaus (voice of Boris Kodjoe) - who mock the bulls for being stinky and not as well-groomed.The next day, the ranch is visited by a popular but smug bullfighter named El Primero (voice of Miguel Angel Silvestre). He is there to pick out the toughest bull so that he can fight them in the ring for what is set to be his final fight. Valiente is confident that he will get picked once he beats the others. The bulls are set into the ring, but Ferdinand holds them up because he refuses to fight. Guapo gets way too nervous, Angus can't see, and Bones is too small. El Primero expresses his disappointment and disgust with the bulls. Later, Guapo is loaded into a truck, thinking that El Primero picked him, but the other bulls see he is being taken to a nearby slaughterhouse. Valiente tells Ferdinand if he's not a fighter, he just becomes meat.Ferdinand gradually starts to earn respect from the other bulls. He helps Angus see by licking his hair up and later has a dance-off with Angus, Maquina, and Bones against the horses, which results in the horses getting shocked by the electric fence and being humiliated. Valiente is the only one who remains disdainful of Ferdinand. He eventually picks a fight with Ferdinand and continues to antagonize him, calling him a coward for refusing to fight.

Valiente is sent to the slaughterhouse.Ferdinand decides to break out and return to the farm to be with Nina. He convinces Lupe to help him so that she can feel loved like he is. With help from the hedgehogs, Ferdinand and Lupe attempt to sneak out of the ranch through the main house, but Ferdinand passes a wall with a picture of his father and his horns mounted on it. In fact, the whole wall has horns of bulls sent to fight. Ferdinand realizes that no matter what, bulls are destined to die in the ring or in the slaughterhouse. Before they leave, Ferdinand decides to break out the other bulls. He even heads to the slaughterhouse to save Valiente and Guapo.

He is found by the ranchers and is taken.News of Ferdinand being taken to fight El Primero makes its way around Spain. Juan and Paco see it on TV, and Juan goes to get Nina so they can save Ferdinand.A huge crowd gathers at the arena to watch the fight. Lupe (who stayed behind and was taken with Ferdinand) tries to convince Ferdinand to fight for his survival. Ferdinand is forced out into the ring and poked by the workers so that he can fight. He doesn't attempt to give a good fight, but he ends up hitting El Primero into the wall. Enraged, the matador tries to attack Ferdinand with banderillas, cutting Ferdinand's shoulder. He picks El Primero by the horns and stares into his eyes, apparently frightening the matador, but Ferdinand lets him down after seeing a rose that fell on the field, which brings him back to the tranquility he felt on the farm with Nina. El Primero prepares to slay Ferdinand, but he hesitates as the bull resigns himself. The rest of the audience yells at El Primero to let Ferdinand live, just as Nina and her father arrive. El Primero spares Ferdinand and leaves with his dignity intact. Nina rushes onto the field to embrace Ferdinand, and the other bulls show up as well.Ferdinand and his friends are brought to the farm. Nina sees Lupe and calls her adorable, making Lupe feel truly loved for the first time. Ferdinand and his friends then go by his favorite tree and flower field to watch the sunset."

When American military analyst, Daniel Ellsberg, realizes to his disgust the depths of the US government's deceptions about the futility of the Vietnam War, he takes action by copying top-secret documents that would become the Pentagon Papers. Later, Washington Post owner, Kay Graham, is still adjusting to taking over her late husband's business when editor Ben Bradlee discovers the New York Times has scooped them with an explosive expose on those papers. Determined to compete, Post reporters find Ellsberg himself and a complete copy of those papers. However, the Post's plans to publish their findings are put in jeopardy with a Federal restraining order that could get them all indicted for Contempt.

Ellsberg, overhearing this, becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the RAND Corporation, Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies hundreds of classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to The New York Times.. Hau Giang Province, South Vietnam, late 1965It's the middle of the war.

One of her colleagues, Arthur Parsons (Bradley Whitford), expresses his own doubts (with Graham listening in the next room) in part because she's a woman and knows that the other men may not feel comfortable with having someone like her in charge. Parsons also mentions how Graham inherited the company after her husband Philip, the previous head publisher, committed suicide (which everyone refers to as an ""accident"").McNamara later visits Graham in her home to inform her that the following day's paper may post something unflattering about him.Bradlee sends an intern to the New York Times to find out what one of its journalists, Neil Sheehan, is preparing to write up.

They finally arrange a meeting in a motel where Ellsberg provides Bagdikian with over 1,000 printed papers.

Jump to the present day where the tombs of many other crusaders are discovered beneath London's catacombs. Dr. Henry Jekyll (Russell Crowe) enters the tunnels and comes across one particular tomb with hieroglyphs, leading him to realize what this means.Through flashbacks, Jekyll tells the story of Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella). She was a cunning warrior who was ready to succeed her father, the Pharaoh Menehptre (Selva Rasalingam), until his second wife gave birth to a boy. Knowing that the boy would be the Pharaoh's new successor, Ahmanet made a pact with Set, the god of death, to sell her soul for a dark power. Ahmanet murders Menehptre, his wife, and their baby.

The pilots are killed, and the plane starts to go down. Nick gives Jenny a parachute and pulls it so she can get out safely. The plane then crashes with everyone onboard.Nick wakes up in a body bag at a morgue in London. Standing next to him is Vail's ghost, who tells him that they are both cursed. Jenny is asked to identify the bodies of the deceased but is surprised to see Nick alive.At the crash site, rescue workers find the sarcophagus and Ahmanet's corpse. One man approaches it and is caught off-guard as Ahmanet sucks the life out of him and his partner to regenerate her body. She then uses her powers to turn them into reanimated corpse slaves.Nick and Jenny are in a pub. He goes to the bathroom and sees Vail's ghost talking to him again. He warns Nick that Ahmanet has chosen him for a reason. Nick then runs out of the pub and is cornered in an alley by a whole swarm of rats. They crawl all over him as he sees Ahmanet crawling toward him, but he is snapped out of this vision by Jenny. She tells Nick what she learned from reading the hieroglyphs on the sarcophagus. She knows about Set's dagger and the jewel that must join it to complete the ritual. Jenny tells Nick about the jewel being buried with the crusaders there in London.Nick and Jenny go to the crusaders' tombs and they uncover the jewel from the crusader's coffin. As they try to leave, they are trapped by Ahmanet and her undead slaves. Nick and Jenny fight off the undead and escape the tomb. They ride through the woods in a van and are chased by Ahmanet and the undead. An undead slave crashes through the windshield and causes the van to overturn and roll down a hill. Ahmanet tries to get Nick, but she is shot with a hook and is taken down. A whole team of men show up to rescue Nick and Jenny.The two are taken to Prodigium, a facility located beneath the Natural History Museum of London. As Nick walks through the hall, he sees a number of artifacts, including a skull with fangs (Dracula?) and a scaly forearm (Creature from the Black Lagoon??). Nick meets Jekyll, who begins to explain what he knows about Ahmanet and the forces of evil out there. Their facility is dedicated to uncovering dark forces and containing them. Ahmanet is chained up and is subdued with mercury being pumped through her body. Nick approaches her and listens to her talking about the ritual she attempted to perform on her lover. She tries to sway Nick by saying he would have complete control over death and become a living god if he joined her.Nick returns to Jekyll's office with Jenny. Jekyll appears to be undergoing a transformation and tries to prevent it using a serum, but Nick grabs the serum, demanding answers. A Prodigium agent pulls Jenny out but leaves Nick inside. Jekyll then turns into his monstrous alter ego, Edward Hyde. He and Nick fight, with Hyde nearly winning until he gets injected with the serum. Meanwhile, Ahmanet summons a camel spider to crawl into the ear of another agent so that he may break her free from her holds. Ahmanet is loose and she takes the dagger and the jewel. Nick and Jenny flee the facility as Ahmanet begins to unleash a sandstorm upon the city.Nick and Jenny run through the tunnels where they encounter more of Ahmanet's undead slaves. The two fight them again, with Nick crushing or ripping their heads off. They are pushed into the water by an undead but they destroy it. Nick and Jenny swim up for air but Ahmanet grabs Jenny and drags her underwater. Nick fights off more of the undead and tries to save Jenny, but she drowns. Nick pulls her body out of the water and is confronted by Ahmanet. He attempts to smash the jewel until Ahmanet once again tries to persuade him to join her. Nick holds the dagger out as if to give it to her, but he instead stabs himself with it, now becoming possessed by Set. He battles Ahmanet and gives her the kiss of death to suck the life out of her, reducing her back to a corpse. Nick then goes over to Jenny and brings her back to life by screaming at her to wake up. He then disappears.Jenny reunites with Jekyll as Ahmanet's body is placed back into a sarcophagus filled with mercury. Jenny wonders what will happen to Nick now that he is technically a monster. Jekyll muses that it took a monster to defeat a monster, and that there is hope for Nick so long as he retains a shred of his humanity.Somewhere in the desert, Nick has brought Vail back to life. They ride their horses off on another adventure as a sandstorm follows them."
The Hitman's Bodyguard,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1959563/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"One of the world's top bodyguards gets a new client, a world class hitman who must testify at the International Criminal Court. They must put their differences aside and work together to make it to the trial alive and on time. With his reputation in tatters after the painfully unsuccessful delivery of a distinguished Japanese client, the former triple-A protection agent, Michael Bryce, is now reduced to a mere second-class bodyguard for hire, two years after the disgraceful incident. Under those circumstances, Bryce would do anything to prove his worth, and, before long, he accepts an offer from Interpol to escort the international assassin, Darius Kincaid, from Manchester to the Hague. The task seems simple: Bryce needs to transport him from point A to point B; nevertheless, the trip to the Netherlands is long and hazardous, and Kincaid--as the only one with the guts and enough hard evidence to testify against a tyrannical Belarusian dictator--is an obvious target. Undoubtedly, it's a tough job, as the mismatched duo will have to put aside their grudges, and race against the clock in a non-stop concerto for bullets. Can the hitman's bodyguard carry through the most important mission in his career?—Nick Riganas Belarussian dictator Vladislav Dukhovich is standing trial for genocide. The trial is not going well for the prosecution - their witnesses tend to turn up dead. They have one trump card though - hitman Darius Kincaid is willing to testify against Dukhovich. Interpol try to get Kincaid to the trial but after the convoy is ambushed, Interpol agent Amelia Roussel, aware that there is a Dukhovich spy in her own organisation, calls in outside help - professional bodyguard Michael Bryce. One problem - Bryce and Kincaid hate each other.—grantss London elite bodyguard Michael Bryce lost his AAA status by trusting his police (now ex) lover Amelia Roussel, compromising his Japanese charge, reducing him to babysitting second rate clients. Now she works for Interpol, which needs to escort most-wanted hit-man Darius Kincaid from their Manchester HQ to The Hague, as crown witness against arrested former tyrannical White Russian president Vladislav Dukhovich, in exchange for the liberation of his dragon-bitch-wife Sonia. The armed convoy was attacked and Darius barely reached a safe-house due to an Interpol mole. Amelia promises to restore Bryce's status if he helps get Darius, who happened to eliminate the Japanese client, safely to the Interational Court. Dukhovich's hired guns spare to effort to kill them, so they must grudgingly collaborate.—KGF Vissers"

In 2104, almost eleven years after the disastrous expedition to the distant moon, LV-223, inPrometheus (2012), the deep-space colonisation vessel, USCSS Covenant, is on course for the remote planet, Origae-6, with more than 2,000 colonists in cryogenic hibernation to build a new world. Instead, a rogue transmission entices the crew to a nearby habitable planet which resembles Earth. As a result, the unsuspecting crewmembers of the Covenant will have to cope with biological foes beyond human comprehension. Now, what started as a peaceful exploratory mission, will soon turn into a desperate rescue operation in uncharted space. Is there an escape from the treacherous, mysterious planet?—Nick Riganas It is the year 2104. The spaceship Covenant is headed for a remote planet in order to colonise it. The ship's captain is killed in a freak accident, leaving the Executive Officer in charge. He makes the decision to investigate a nearby planet in order to colonise it, as a possible substitute for their original mission. This has dramatic and far-reaching consequences.—grantss The crew of the colony ship Covenant, bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, discovers what they think is an uncharted paradise, but is actually a dark, dangerous world. When they uncover a threat beyond their imagination, they must attempt a harrowing escape.—Twentieth Century Fox In a prologue, business magnate Peter Weyland speaks with his newly activated android, who chooses the name ""David"" after observing a replica of Michelangelo's statue of David. Weyland tells David that one day they will search for mankind's creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator's limited one.In 2104, 11 years after the 'Prometheus' expedition, the colonization ship 'Covenant' is bound for a remote planet, Origae-6, with a crew of 15, two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship's computer to wake the crew, which includes several married couples. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission from a nearby, habitable planet. Against the objections of Daniels (Branson's widow), the new captain, Oram, decides to investigate.As the Covenant remains in orbit, an expedition team descends to the earth-like planet's surface and tracks the transmission's signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by alien spores. Oram's wife Karine helps the rapidly-sickening Ledward back to the lander where Maggie, the pilot, quarantines them both inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward's back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. The neomorph escapes while a similar creature bursts from Hallett's mouth.The neomorphs attack the remaining crew members and kill one. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the 'Prometheus' mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of humanoid (Engineer) corpses. David tells them that upon his and fellow 'Prometheus' survivor Elizabeth Shaw's arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. After the crew members tell David of their mission, they attempt to contact the 'Covenant' but are prevented by fierce storms. The surviving neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills crew member Rosenthal. David tries to communicate with the creature, but is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting, with the black liquid (formed from the blood of the first Deacon) and a facehugger egg found in the Engineer city, in an attempt to create a new species even more superior to himself, just as he believes himself superior to the humans that created him, and the humans to be superior to the Engineers. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by an alien facehugger. An alien creature (xenomorph) later erupts from Oram's chest, killing him.As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter, who has found Shaw's dissected corpse, confronts David. David explains that he believes humans are a inferior species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and confronts David while Daniels escapes as they fight. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph appears and kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Pilot Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has ""expired"". After an encounter outside the ship, they kill the Xenomorph and return to the 'Covenant'.The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope's chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the Covenant's terraforming bay and flush it into space.The 'Covenant' resumes its trip to Origae-6, and the surviving crew re-enters stasis. As Walter puts Daniels under, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her stasis pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage alongside the human embryos before entering the cargo bay containing the colonists in stasis. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crew members except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6."

This outrageous family comedy tells the story of two overly imaginative pranksters, George (Kevin Hart) and Harold (Thomas Middleditch), who hypnotize their principal (Ed Helms) into thinking he's an enthusiastic, yet dimwitted, superhero named Captain Underpants.—20th Century Fox Humour-obsessed neighbour best friends in fourth grade George Beard (voice of Kevin Hart) and Harold Hutchins (voice of Thomas Middleditch) live in Piqua, Ohio and attend the Jerome Hortwitz Elementary School where they love pull pranks and create home-made comics about superheroes. the film opens as tell the story of one of their comics - long ago in a galaxy far, far away, there was an extraterrestrial planet full of humanoid aliens that wore only their underwear (and some capes) which was set to blow up. The King Long-Johns and Queen Panty-Hose of the planet sent their baby to Earth where he was raised by a dolphin couple. That baby grew quickly and would become a superhero named Captain Underpants, George and Harold's superhero creation. As they complete their origin issue, it is snatched up and torn apart by the boys' mean and cruel school principal Mr. Benjamin Krupp (voice of Ed Helms) who hates the two boys for their mischievous behaviour. George and Harold address the viewers to let them know that Krupp hates just about everything fun and is always out to make their lives miserable.The boys are brought into Krupp's office. While he doesn't have evidence, he knows the boys are responsible for a number of elaborate pranks set across Jerome Horwitz Elementary School, including (but not limited to) putting silly pictures of a teacher on the board, gluing a teacher's buttocks to her chair, and bringing a tiger into class. Krupp vows to put an end to their trouble.As George and Harold walk to class, they explain that they make up pranks to cheer up the students, all of whom are utterly miserable at school. They get to class where they sit behind their ""nerdy nemesis"" nerd rival Melvin Sneedly (voice of Jordan Peele), who has no sense of humor. Over the loudspeaker, Krupp announces that all students are required to spend their Saturday at the school's Invention Convention, which only Melvin is excited for (as he is smarter than the other kids and loves science).The boys go to George's treehouse where they have their own comic studio, Treehouse Comix Inc. They mention how the two of them became friends in kindergarten - they both laughed when the teacher was talking about the planet Uranus and called it a ""gas giant"". Thus, George and Harold became lifelong best buddies.On Saturday, the boys get excited about what they get to do for the day, until their parents remind them they have to go to the Invention Convention. All the kids dejectedly trudge into the school auditorium. only Melvin goes up to present a bunch of his home-made inventions, which bores everyone and even puts Mr. Krupp to sleep. Seeing an opportunity, Harold convinces George to pull off their best prank yet. They sneak behind Melvin's mechanical ""Turbo Toilet 2000"" invention and rig it to start shooting toilet paper rolls across the room and flashing lights everywhere as Aretha Franklin's ""Think"" plays. The kids all love it and go crazy whilst Krupp and Melvin are extremely angry. The boys walk out of the school feeling triumphant until they are called into the office of Mr. Krupp.Krupp has Melvin come into the office to show the boys that he's finally got proof of their pranks. Melvin hands over one of his new inventions, the ""Tattle Turtle 200"", a mechanical green tortoise which has a security nanny camera inside. It clearly shows footage of George and Harold messing with the Turbo Toilet. Now that Krupp has dirt on them, he can finally put the boys in separate classes, thereby keeping them apart as friends.Harold freaks out about Krupp splitting him and George up. He imagines a world where the two no longer see each other and awkwardly bump into each other at the mall before getting attacked by robots (because it's the future) and a giant version of the Tattle Turtle. George agrees that it's bad and they plot to stop Krupp.At school, the boys wait for an opening to sneak into Mr. Krupp's office. They see him sharing a mutual attraction with Edith (voice of Kristen Schaal), the school's lunch lady who made him a tuna casserole. Krupp follows Edith but his secretary Miss Edith Anthrope enters the office before George and Harold can get in. They distract her by calling the office and putting her on hold so she may win a billion dollars. The boys sneak past her and get into Krupp's office where they find a drawer full of things he confiscated from them over the years, including a whoopee cushion, their old comics, and a plastic Hypnosis-Ring from a cereal box of Sugar Doodles. Krupp then returns, and he prepares to sign papers to separate George and Harold by signing a dotted line on a paper. Desperate, George jumps onto Mr. Krupp's desk and uses the Hypno-Ring on him. The room literally spins as Krupp is put in a trance, and the boys are surprised to find that the hypnosis actually works on him. George and Harold have fun with this by making Krupp to act like a chicken and monkey, but then they get the idea to turn him into Captain Underpants. Krupp rips off his clothes (except his undies) and toupee, and pulls off a red curtain to make a cape before declaring his catchphrase ""Tra-la-laaaaaaaa!"" The boys think it's hilarious until Captain Underpants jumps out the window and runs into the street, getting hit by a car.George and Harold run after Captain Underpants as he makes his way into the city. He sees a mime clown and thinks he is trapped in an invisible box, so he tries to ""break"" it by punching through it, hitting the mime in the face. Captain Underpants then throws an old lady into a tree as she tries to retrieve her cat. He then goes up to a tall building to face what he thinks is a giant monster, but it's really just a big purple inflatable gorilla. The boys rush into a crane and drive after him to stop him before he hurts himself. They pop the balloon and make Captain Underpants land on two bank robbers trying to get away, making him look like a real hero catching bad guys. George and Harold take him away before the cops get to him. Meanwhile, a short little old man (Nick Kroll) sees a flyer poster for a science teaching position at the elementary school. He starts to maniacal laugh sinisterly.The boys take Captain Underpants back to the treehouse. When he gets wet, he turns back into Mr. Krupp. As long as the boys keep snapping their fingers, he will stay as Captain Underpants. However, while he's at school, they need to have him pretend to be mean old Mr. Krupp to keep up appearances. They run into Edith, who asks about the tuna casserole. Captain Underpants comments on her blue eyes, charming her. The boys take him to his office, but they find the little man from before applying for the science teacher job. He goes by Professor P, and he starts his interview with Captain Underpants, revealing he is a scientist. George and Harold notice Professor P pulling out a number of weapons (a mace, an axe, etc). They read his resume, which clearly highlights his plans for revenge, but Captain Underpants hires him on the spot.Professor P starts teaching science. He talks to the children about the parts in a child's brain, specifically the stem part that responds to anything humorous, known as the ""Hahaguffawchucklealamus"". Professor P really hates laughter and wants to get rid of it completely, which Melvin sympathizes with since he finds nothing funny. George makes a joke about the Professor's name that the class laughs at, causing Professor P to send him and Harold back to Krupp's office.The boys return to the office, but Krupp has gotten himself wet from Harold's Soaking Machine (a really large water gun), so he's back to being aggressive and cantankerous. The boys snap their fingers and he's Captain Underpants again. They use him to get Professor P's file from the secretary, and they learn that his real name is Professor Poopypants.Poopypants comes into the cafeteria and sees all the kids laughing. They are reading George and Harold's latest comic, ""Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants"". This triggers a flashback for Poopypants when he was set to win a prize for inventing a laser gun machine known as the ""Sizerator"" that shrinks and grows things. However, when his name was spoken aloud, everyone laughed and could not take him seriously, starting his drive for revenge. When George and Harold show up, Poopypants takes them to see Mr. Krupp, but he's still Captain Underpants. Poopypants notices a character in the comic named Anti-Humor Boy, who is supposed to strike resemblance of Melvin.The boys take an unconscious Mr. Krupp home. They decide to snoop around for fun, only to discover that Mr. Krupp is really lonely.Poopypants finds Melvin and uses him as part of his evil plan. He scans Melvin's brain and learns that he doesn't have the part in the brain that responds to humor. This becomes crucial to his plan.Captain Underpants throws a funfair carnival for the whole school in the front schoolyard. Things get chaotic as he keeps getting wet, and the boys have to keep snapping their fingers. Captain Underpants starts feeding the kids sugar, and George and Harold want in on it. This turns out to be a bad idea because they experience a strong sugar rush, leading Captain Underpants to his own devices. He tries to drive a bus through rings of fire over a ramp, but he gets wet and slows it down. After a finger snap, he rides the bus backwards into a Ferris wheel, which comes loose and rolls toward the school. Captain Underpants sails down in a parachute, but it starts raining, and he's Mr. Krupp again. Since he cannot be snapped back to Captain Underpants due to too much rain, Mr. Krupp is now able to get the boys in trouble.Mr. Krupp separates George and Harold into separate classes. The boys sadly walk away from each other.Poopypants and Melvin are ready with their invention, a giant robot version of Melvin's own toilet invention, the Turbo Toilet 2000. When they try to start it up, they find that it has no fuel. Melvin leads Poopypants to the school's cafeteria where they get a stash of toxic leftover food to use as fuel.The Turbo Toilet starts stomping around town outside the school. George and Harold see it from their classes and both ask to be excused. They reunite in the bathroom but they witness the villains use Melvin's brain to power a beam that zaps the children and turns them into humorless drones. The boys run to get Captain Underpants. He joins the fight, but - as shown through George and Harold's flip-o-Rama book since they claim the scene would be too violent and expensive - the Turbo Toilet beats Captain Underpants easily. Poopypants drops Captain Underpants into the toilet's mouth before grabbing George and Harold. He zaps them to rid them of their laughter, but he sees that the humor part of their brains are way too big. Slowly, the humor starts to drain from them, turning them into drones as well. Then Poopypants says ""Uranus"", reverting the boys back to their normal state. The Turbo Toilet starts to overload and malfunction as a result. Melvin bails out and the Toilet comes crashing down.Unwilling to accept defeat, Poopypants pulls out his shrink/grow gun. He tries to hit the boys with it but hits things like the school and a bird. In the Toilet, Captain Underpants consumes the radioactive leftovers, giving him real superpowers. He flies out of the Toilet and starts to fight Poopypants. The boys get the gun from him and they shrink him while (mostly) turning things back to normal. However, Poopypants escapes on a bee.The boys are with Captain Underpants in their treehouse. Knowing they can't keep him like this forever, George and Harold accept that maybe they have to deal with being in separate classes, and realise that the punishment is not actually that bad. George breaks the Hypno-Ring, and Mr. Krupp is back. He freaks out over being practically naked and he runs away. George and Harold then realize that the difference between Mr. Krupp and Captain Underpants is that Captain Underpants has them, but Mr. Krupp has nobody. They then plan their newest prank.Mr. Krupp finds a note in his mail at school. George and Harold made a card pretending to be Edith, and they sent her one as Mr. Krupp, asking each other on a date. The two of them are excited, and Mr. Krupp is happier than usual. He then returns the Captain Underpants comics to the boys, admitting that he read them and thought they were pretty funny.Mr. Krupp and Edith go on their date. George and Harold see them in a restaurant, and they agree not to do something so nice like that again. Next to the restaurant, the Turbo Toilet spills the toxic nuclear leftovers onto a bunch of dumped toilets in a scrapyard dump, mutating them into toilet-like monsters. One toilet attacks the restaurant and eats someone, leading Krupp to ask for the check. He snaps his fingers and causes himself to turn back into Captain Underpants. The boys are surprised as he flies out of the restaurant, fighting all the toilets. He then flies into the sky with George and Harold latching onto his cape as they say ""Here we go again!""During the mid-credits, Mr. Krupp's secretary, Miss Edith Anthrope, is STILL on hold for the billion dollars. George and Harold walk by her and go back to the phone. They startle her and she accidentally hangs up, Cue her scream of rage and teasing a poster for an upcoming follow-up: ""Captain Underpants & The On-Hold Woman!""."

A Dog's Purpose,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753383/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dog looks to discover his purpose in life over the course of several lifetimes and owners. Lasse Hallström ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" directed this adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name by W. Bruce Cameron, which follows a dog voiced by Josh Gad as he is reincarnated as different breeds belonging to various owners. Over the course of multiple lifetimes, the canine's existence intersects with that of a young boy who rescued him in 1962. In the 1950s, a feral puppy is born, wondering what life's true purpose is. Two weeks later, he is whisked away to the dog pound and quickly euthanized, wondering if ""fun"" truly is life's purpose. His strong spirit is reborn and reincarnated as a newborn Retriever puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a puppy mill and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, and the dog is spotted locked inside their pick-up truck by a young boy named Ethan and his mother, who rescue him from heatstroke. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is renamed Bailey. Bailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. A dog develops a relationship with a male. After he passes away and moves on to his next lifetimes, he tries everything to locate and be by his master's side once again. He also tries his best to help his master to make him happy by locating and reuniting his love with his master.—RECB3 The movie opens with the narrator (Josh Gad) telling us about his life as a dog. He starts out as a newborn puppy looking for milk from his mom. A few weeks later, he is out raiding garbage with his siblings (He appears to be a mutt at this point). Two men show up and capture him in a net and put in a vehicle for the city pound. Fade to colored bubbles.(It is implied he was euthanased) We never learn what time frame this life was, but the vehicle was very old fashioned.Bailey:He regains awareness inside of a cage as a recent puppy. He is shocked that he remembers his previous life and wonders what the purpose is. (The time is set in the 1960's) These cages appear to be part of some kind of breeder or outdoor pet store who sells many kinds of dogs. The handler shows him to a client and introduces him has a 'Red Retriever' (A type of Golden Retriever), the client is not interested as he is looking for a smaller dog, and they place him back. They neglect to lock the cage, and the dog escapes in a hole in the fence.After wandering in the road, he's picked up by two men in a pickup truck thinking that they can get a 'few bucks' for selling him. The two men park the truck on the street and head into a building (presuming a bar), leaving the dog without water and all the windows up. The dog starts to dehydrate and is thinking it's time for the next life. A boy named Ethan (Bryce Ghesiar) and his mom see the dog dying, break the car window, and take the dog home. (We do not see them nurse the dog, but it's implied). The dog opens his eyes and is glad to be alive. The boy and his mom try to convince his dad if he can keep it. We see at this point that the dad might be an alcoholic.The dog is taken to a local engraver who makes a large metal tag with the name Bailey on one side and Ethan Montgomery on the other (Important for later). Bailey is shown going around the house and neighborhood and even learning to live with the house cat, who's Bailey is giving 'dog lessons' to. Bailey is continuing his internal monologue for things like 'I see Ethan get on the yellow box with wheels and leave for a while, I miss him.' Ethan calls him 'Boss Dog' which Bailey agrees by barking loudly. (Another important item)We see the family on a trip to the family farm where Bailey is impressed by all the new smells especially the smell of goat. (The family is less impressed by the bad farm smell). Bailey enjoys chasing the chickens around as well as play with 'Horsedog' a donkey kept by the family. At this point we see Ethan and Bailey playing with an old deflated football where Ethan teaches Bailey how to use Ethan's back to launch and catch the ball after throwing the ball straight up.Back at home during one of his 'dog lessons' Bailey messes up Ethan's father's desk (He's a traveling salesman who has a home office) and when Ethan's father gets home, he sees Ethan trying to clean it up and tells Ethan, he needs to hurry because his boss is coming over, and he might get a promotion (It's implied the traveling job is putting a lot of stress on him). The father pulls out his treasured coin collection which Ethan starts playing with his rare 'Eagle' coin. Bailey, thinking it was a snack, swallows the coin. The boss shows up that night with his wife. It's obvious what Ethan's dad wants, and his boss turns him down saying that he's the best field agent, and a promotion to a desk job isn't forthcoming, the boss then asks the father about the 'Eagle' coin. At this point, Ethan runs outside with Bailey and tried to encourage Bailey to 'hurry out' the coin. Some scenes where Ethan is shaking and carrying the dog to force digestion is shown. Eventually, the dog does let 'go' of the coin. Ethan runs into the house and sees his dad about to open the case (where there is obviously a missing coin), and Ethan screams 'Rat!' and during the confusion, puts the coin back. Unfortunately, this sets Bailey off (who wants the rat), and it ends up with the Boss's wife landing in the cake, and the dining room table destroyed and all hopes for a promotion gone. Bailey has been banished to the garage (though he does sneak back in the house later that night).(10 Years or so later)Ethan (now played by K.J Apa) is now a young man who is the star quarterback in high school. We also meet Todd (Logan Miller), the 2nd string quarterback who is very jealous of Ethan and calls Bailey 'the girlfriend.' Bailey doesn't like Todd and trips him. Ethan comes home to share the good news with his parents, and we see his father apparently drunk sitting on the couch. He has not come to any of Ethan's games. They take a trip back to the family farm where Bailey has fun with Horsedog. Ethan goes to a local fair where he falls for a girl (Brit Robertson) at the shooting gallery named Hannah. Bailey decides to get them together ('Ethan has this funny smell') by running up to Hannah. We see Ethan and Hannah go on a few dates where Bailey comments internally things like 'Why does Ethan keep licking her face? I have tried it, and she doesn't have any food there'. We also see a scene where the cat has passed away, and they bury it only to have Bailey dig it back up thinking they were playing hide and seek. (Bailey is a retriever)Back at home, we see that Ethan's parent's relationship has worsened to the point where his father is hitting his mother and drinking heavily now. Ethan breaks them up and kicks his father out. His father comes to Ethan's final game where we find out that Ethan has gotten a full football scholarship to Michigan State and Hannah will go there on an academic one. Ethan's father shows up at Ethan's celebration party very drunk and makes a scene much to Todd's delight. Ethan decks Todd for pointing that his father is a drunkard. That night, Todd puts a large firecracker in Ethan's house starting a fire. Bailey wakes up Ethan who goes and wakes his mom. The fire is too hot to go down the stairs, so Ethan lowers his mom and Bailey out a window. Ethan then jumps out, and lands on a rake, as well as part of the house, falls on his leg crushing it. We see Ethan, and his mom leave in an ambulance where Bailey leads the police to Todd who confesses everything.Ethan and his mom move back to the farm. Bailey thinks it's all fun with the two sticks (crutches) that Ethan plays with now. Ethan, all bitter that he lost his career (It appears his leg will never heal properly) breaks up with Hannah and sends her crying. Bailey is sad that Hannah is leaving. Ethan is sent to a farming school where he will learn how to take care of the farm, and Bailey is left behind at the farm. It is implied that Bailey is slowly dying of a broken heart. Ethan arrives as they give Bailey a shot to 'ease the pain.' Cut to bubbles.Ellie:Our narrator again wakes up, and this time he's a female German Shepherd (Cut to comedy scenes where Bailey (Now Ellie) can't find certain items). Ellie appears to be a police K9 in training (Chicago) and complains how 'playtime' is more like work (Which it is work). Ellie is also taught to find 'Wally' who keeps losing his clothing (Standard Dog smell training). Ellie's handler Carlos (John Ortiz) appears to treat Ellie as a tool. We also learn that Carlos might have had a wife who no longer lives with him. (Picture on the nightstand and Ellie can smell that someone else used to live here). After a while, Carlos opens up to Ellie and allows her to sleep on the bed (Bailey always slept on Ethan's bed)Ellie is given a smell of a girl who was kidnapped by her mom's ex-boyfriend. Driving around the city, Ellie catches a whiff of the girl's smell, and Carlos (using her barks) traces it to a small dam. The corner the man who is holding a gun to the girl. She kicks the man and falls into the dam. Ellie jumps after her to pull her to safety and Carlos chases after the man. Carlos is knocked down by the man and almost shot when Ellie jumps in and takes the bullet. The man is arrested, and we see Carlos crying on Ellie's body. Cut to bubbles.Toby:He awakens again as a male Corgi (Toby) who was just adopted by a female College student Maya (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). He's amazed that he is so short now as well as not having a tail (He tries to do the standard 'dog chasing his tail' and fails). Maya takes him around school and even brushes off a fellow student Al (Pooch Hall) because she has to take care of Toby. Toby's vet tells Maya that Toby is getting too fat and needs exercise. At the local park, Toby meets another dog 'Roxie' and falls in love (Roxie is a larger dog like a Wolfhound and towers over Toby). Toby keeps harassing Roxie, and we find out that Roxie's owner is Al. Cue to scenes where Al and Maya and going on dates (with the dogs) and a comedy scene where Al proposes to Maya at a restaurant, but Toby sees the food being served 'flambe' and panics thinking the place is being burned down. (BTW he was 'saving' Roxie, not Maya).More scenes where Toby is growing up as well that Al and Maya's children (They torture him regularly). Then we see that Roxie was put down and Toby slowly descends into depression (like with Bailey). Cut to bubbles.Buddy:For the final part of the film, he wakes up in the back of a truck as a St. Bernard mix puppy. He's picked up by a lady who takes him home. Her husband/boyfriend is not happy about him and chains him up in the backyard. Cue to some montages showing him living in the backyard (full of trash) during all kinds of weather including snow and rain and events like when the police came over (Not sure why they were there). Finally, the man puts him in the back of the truck while the girl says 'you are taking him to a good place right.' He grunts. Scenes of the truck driving around flash by. Finally, the truck stops on a bridge, and the man kicks the dog out and drives away.The dog thinks it was good that he left that family, and starts walking around (he's very filthy and looks like a stray). He finally ends up outside of a dog park where he meetings a strange dog with piercing eyes. He thinks that he knows the smell on that dog, but the dog is led away by a little girl and her mom.As he wanders, he realizes that his nose knows this place. It's Ethan's farm! He greets horse dog (who's still around) and barks at Ethan's door until an older Ethan (Dennis Quaid) shows up and feeds him. Ethan doesn't want a dog and takes him to the pound. After one night Ethan realizes that he does miss having a dog around and goes back and adopts the dog. Cut to a scene where Ethan is at the same engraver having the tag 'Buddy / Ethan Montgomery' made up.Buddy realizes that Ethan is a lonely old man and decides to do something about it. He goes back to the dog park (This time as a clean dog with a tag) and meets up with the same dog again. This time he follows the family home (they live nearby) and when they get home 'grandma' comes over. Grandma smell verify familiar as Buddy realizes that it's Hannah! (Played by Peggy Lipton). Hannah looks at Buddy's tag and realizes who his owner is.Hannah takes Buddy home to Ethan, and there are a few awkward moments where they discuss how their lives have been (Ethan never married, and Hannah's husband died). Finally, they reconcile (while Buddy wonders if they lick faces again). Cut to Ethan's and Hannah's wedding. (Ethan comments on how he has no family, but Hannah has more than enough). After the wedding, Ethan is cleaning up, and Buddy wants Ethan to know it's him. Buddy goes into the barn and brings out the old flat football they played with. Ethan plays with him a while and finds out that Buddy knows Bailey's old trick of jumping on him (Ethan is flattened by Buddy BTW). Ethan then remembers how Bailey liked the term 'Boss Dog' and Buddy starts barking to the same term. Ethan then realizes that Buddy is Bailey!The last scene of the movie shows Ethan making a new tag for 'Bailey.' Bailey ends the movie by saying that a 'Dogs Purpose' must be to have fun and help others have fun."
The Shape of Water,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580390/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"At a top secret research facility in the 1960s, a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature that is being held in captivity. From master storytellerGuillermo del Torocomes THE SHAPE OF WATER, an otherworldly fable set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962. In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment. Rounding out the cast are Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Doug Jones.—Fox Searchlight Pictures 1962 Baltimore. Elisa Esposito, found abandoned as a baby with scars on her neck, has been mute all her life, that disability which has largely led to her not having opportunities. Despite being a bright woman, she works a manual labor job as a cleaner at a military research facility where she has long been friends with fellow cleaner, Zelda Fuller, who often translates her sign language to others at the facility. And she has had no romance in her life, her major emotional support, beyond Zelda, being her aging gay artist neighbor, Giles, the two who live in adjoining apartment units above a movie theater. Like Elisa, Giles is lonely, his homosexuality complicating both his personal and professional life, the latter as a commercial graphic artist. Elisa's life changes when Colonel Richard Strickland brings a new ""asset"" into the facility, Elisa discovering it being a seeming mixed human/amphibious creature found in the waters of the Amazon. Secretly visiting with the creature, Elisa is immediately drawn to him, and despite he having a violent side as part of his inherent being, the two find a way to communicate with each other and end up forming a bond with each other. Elisa has to decide what to do when she discovers that although the reason for bringing the creature to the facility is to test the possibility of him being sent into space, Colonel Strickland, who has always had antagonistic feelings toward the creature, ultimately wants to kill him, this following the systematic torture he has inflicted on him. Elisa may have to balance her feelings on wanting to be with the creature against what may be the greater benefit to him of being set free back into the wilds of the water. Complicating matters are that the Soviets are also aware of the creature, they having a secret agent who has infiltrated the facility.—Huggo Still at the peak of the space race and the Cold War in early-sixties Baltimore, Elisa Esposito, a forlorn and lonely mute woman, has a mundane daily routine as a night-time janitor in a top-secret underground research facility. With literally only two friends, Zelda, the solicitous co-worker who does all the talking for both of them, and Giles, her ageing painter neighbour, Elisa will find herself thrilled with the unexpected arrival of an Amazonian Amphibian Man at the cavernous corporation. Kept on a short leash inside a confined water tank, the mysterious scaly creature is, inevitably, the centre of attention; however, as an empathetic and almost mystical bond begins to timidly bloom between species, the very survival of this rare specimen lies in the hands of an improbable and frail saviour. But can there be a future when you are trapped?—Nick Riganas Elisa is a mute, isolated woman who works as a cleaning lady in a hidden, high-security government laboratory in 1962 Baltimore. Her life changes forever when she discovers the lab's classified secret -- a mysterious, scaled creature from South America that lives in a water tank. As Elisa develops a unique bond with her new friend, she soon learns that its fate and very survival lies in the hands of a hostile government agent and a marine biologist.—Jwelch5742 The film opens as we go through a home that appears to be underwater. We hear the voice of a man named Giles (Richard Jenkins) mention the story of a princess, the one she loved, and the monster that threatened to tear them apart.Baltimore, c. 1962Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman who lives alone but frequently spends time with Giles, her middle-aged bachelor neighbor, who lives next door to her in another small apartment overhead a local movie theater. She works at the Occam Aerospace Research Center as a janitor with her friend Zelda Fuller (Octavia Spencer). During their daily night shift, a vessel is brought into the facility containing a valuable asset. Elisa goes near the vessel, and something bumps against it from inside.In the morning after work, Giles takes Elisa to his favorite pie shop where he frequently gets key lime pie. Elisa doesn't like it, but Giles enjoys the pie, as well as the conversations he has with the shop's ""Pie Guy"" (Morgan Kelly), whom the closeted homosexual Giles has a crush on. We also see Giles working on an ad design for a jello product for the company that he used to work for before being suspended, apparently because of a drinking problem.At work, Elisa and Zelda are cleaning a bathroom when Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) comes in and splashes some water after washing his hands before he uses the urinal. A while later, the ladies hear a scream coming from another room, and Strickland emerges with two fingers missing from his left hand. Elisa and Zelda must clean the blood in the room where they are keeping the new ""asset"". Elisa splashes a bucket of water on the floor, and Strickland's fingers come out from under a shelf. Elisa packs them in a bag to send to the hospital with him.Elisa discovers that the Asset (Doug Jones) is a fish-like humanoid creature. She becomes fascinated by it and starts sneaking into the enclosure to spend time with it. Over the next few days, Elisa feeds it hard-boiled eggs, teaches it sign language, and plays music records to listen to. She hides when she hears someone enter. It's Strickland, coming to torture the Asset by zapping it with a cattle prod, merely to taunt it out of spite for his fingers.Strickland's home life is soon revealed that he is married with two young children whom he does not seem to show any attention too. When his wife wants to have sex with him while their kids are at school, he has rough sex with her and doesn't slow down or stop when he becomes too rough on her.A new doctor at the facility, Robert Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), is actually a Soviet spy named Dimitri. He meets with his bosses, who take him to a Russian-themed restaurant to discuss the Asset. Hoffstetler tells the men that he believes the creature can communicate and is intelligent. The bosses later give Hoffstetler a poison to kill the creature to prevent the Americans from advancing their scientific research. Meanwhile, Strickland's own arrogant boss, General Hoyt (Nick Searcy), wants to harvest the Asset's body for space travel technology.Elisa becomes fearful for the Asset's safety and lets Giles know that she wants to help it. Giles doesn't think it's a good idea, but Elisa sees no difference between the creature and herself as they are both individuals that are unlike regular people, and she is worried that if she does nothing, it will die.Giles pays another visit to the pie shop. He starts a friendly conversation with Pie Guy until Giles reaches out to touch his hand, and the man reacts angrily. It gets worse when an African-American couple enters and the racist and homophobic Pie Guy tells them they can't sit at the counter. Giles is also told to leave and not return.Meanwhile, Elisa becomes the unwanted attention by Strickland when he deliberately spills a glass of water in his office and forces her to clean it up. He then man-handles her, claiming that he is turned on by the fact that she is mute and tells her that if she spends more time with him, he can make her ""squack"". Elisa leaves.Hurt and angry over being rejected and having to live his life in the closet out of fear in this homophobic society, Giles decides to help Elisa break out the Asset and uses his skills to decorate a van and make a fake ID for himself. Elisa initiates their plan by turning cameras away from the enclosure. She sneaks the Asset into a laundry hamper and wheels it away while Giles drives into the facility. Zelda is leaving work, but realizes what Eliza is up to.At the same time, Hoffstetler is also preparing to take action, apparently to carry out his orders, but he discovers Elisa's plan and decides to help her. He shuts down power with a bomb device and uses a syringe on a guard. Strickland rushes to the exit, but is too late. Helped by Zelda and Hoffstetler, Elisa gets the creature inside the van, and Giles drives them away, wrecking Strickland's new car in the process.Elisa brings the Asset to her apartment and keeps it in her bath tub with chemicals that Hoffstetler gave her, plus some salt to keep it healthy. When she goes to work the following night, Strickland interrogates her and Zelda but doesn't believe they could have been responsible. As she leaves, Elisa signs ""fuck you"" to Strickland, which Zelda translates as ""thank you"".While Giles is tending to the Asset, he falls asleep. The Asset gets out of the tub and sees one of Giles's cats. The cat hisses at the Asset, and it growls back before it brutally kills the cat. Giles sees this and frightens the Asset. It runs out, scratching Giles's arm. When Elisa returns, Giles tells her what happened. She runs out to look for it, only to find it in the movie theater beneath the apartments. She brings it back upstairs and tends to it. The Asset touches Giles's head and arm, and it starts to glow a blue color.In the morning, Giles discovers hair on his head where there previously was none. The cut on his arm is also completely healed.Elisa and the Asset grow closer, and they have bestial sex in the bathroom. Elisa even floods the bathroom so that they can swim together, but it causes a leak into the theater, and Giles is forced by the theater owner to open the door and let the water out. She eventually plans to free the Asset into a canal with rainwater flooding it. Elisa grows more attached to the Asset, even imagining a scenario where she is in an old-timey musical number singing about her love for him.Meanwhile, General Hoyt visits the facility to chastise Strickland for losing the Asset and gives him 36 hours to find it.Hoffstetler's own bosses realize he didn't kill the Asset, but they spare Hoffstetler for the time being, telling him he will be extracted in two days time back to Russia.On the day that Elisa plans to release the Asset, Zelda comes over and sees that its scales are peeling off, and they are out of the chemicals from the facility. They plan to take the Asset away that night.Strickland follows Hoffstetler to his rendezvous point where he always meets his bosses. They shoot Hoffstetler repeatedly, but before they can finish him off, Strickland shows up and kills them first. He grabs Hoffstetler by the bullet hole in his cheek and tortures him to give up the Asset's location, thinking he is hiding it for other Soviet spies. With his dying breath, Hoffstetler laughs at Strickland and says, ""No names. No rankings. They just clean.""Strickland then goes to Zelda's home to interrogate her and her husband Brewster (Martin Roach). Growing more mad and delusional, he tears off the two fingers on his hand that hadn't healed after being reattached. Zelda is silent, but Brewster tells him that Elisa has the Asset. After Strickland leaves, Zelda scolds Brewster and then calls Elisa to warn her. She and Giles take the Asset away before Strickland shows up. He breaks into Elisa's apartment and sees the note on her calendar that lets him know she's taking the Asset to the canal.Elisa and Giles bring the Asset to the canal. They say their goodbyes to the creature, but it signs to Elisa, ""Me and you together forever."" She responds that he must go without her. Strickland shows up and punches Giles in the face before shooting both the Asset and Elisa. Thinking he just won, Strickland turns to leave but gets whacked in the face by Giles. The Asset revives itself and heals its own bullet wounds. Strickland is impressed and calls the Asset a god before it slashes Strickland's throat with its claws. Just as the police arrive, the Asset takes Elisa into the water as Giles and Zelda (who just arrived) watch.Underwater, the Asset kisses Elisa, using its healing powers to revive her and give her gills where there were once scars on her neck. The two hold each other as Giles's voice closes the film saying that the two of them could now be together."

In sun-kissed Emerald Bay, the vigorous Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon and Baywatch, his elite team of hand-picked and perfectly tanned lifeguards, protect the bay, keeping both sunbathers and beach lovers safe. However, this summer, two new eager trainees will join the demanding life-saving program, as well as an insubordinate former Olympic swimmer, who are all called to prove their worth on the lifeguard towers just on time when a new synthetic street drug begins to infest the Emerald Bay: the flakka. Without a doubt, this calls for some serious undercover teamwork action, as the badgeless heroes in spandex comb the beach for shady newcomers and nefarious entrepreneurs with hidden agendas of their own. Can Mitch's band save the bay?—Nick Riganas Matt Brody is a 2-time Olympic champion swimmer. However, due to drug and alcohol problems he has fallen from grace, to the point that he now has to perform community service as part of a plea deal for an offense. He will serve his time as a lifesaver at Emerald Bay lifeguard station, run by the no-nonsense Mitch Buchannon. Brody soon discovers that his celebrity status will earn him no favours. Meanwhile, people are dying in mysterious circumstances in Emerald Bay and Buchannon and his lifesaving team investigate. The occurrences may be linked to a nearby property development.—grantss Matt Brody, a disgraced Olympic swimmer tries to find redemption by filling out one of three spots that have opened up on the Baywatch lifeguard team. He must fight his demons, get Mitch and the rest of the team to see there is more to him, get Summer the girl he likes to reciprocate and keep the beach safe and clean.—ColiD In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran C. J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch discovers a small pouch of drug washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of Colombian businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been secretly bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others in efforts to increase her stake in the bay.. The film starts with Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) arriving at work to perform his duties as a lifeguard on the beaches of Emerald Bay, Florida. He sees a man parasailing on the water, but the man hits his head on a rock, forcing Mitch to spring into action. He dives into the ocean and swims to the man's rescue.Following this, Mitch goes for his morning run around the Bay. He passes through Sergeant Ellerbee (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a local policeman and beach patrol officer with whom he frequently messes with regarding their status as enforcers of the law around that area. While continuing his run, Mitch spots a small boy picking up a pouch of the drug Flaca on the beach. Mitch takes it from the boy and observes it.Mitch's fellow lifeguards are Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera), who Mitch considers the best after himself, and CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrbach), who is the object of affection for aspiring lifeguard Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass). Ronnie is flying a toy craft on the beach with his colleague Dave (Hannibal Buress) when CJ runs up (in slow-motion, of course) to wish Ronnie good luck on the upcoming qualifiers, but Ronnie can barely put a sentence together around her.Arriving on the bay is Matt Brody (Zac Efron) on his motorcycle. He tries to introduce himself to one of the prospective lifeguards, Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), but she ignores him. Brody then meets Mitch and Stephanie, explaining his new position on the team and his status as a two-time Olympic gold medal winner, but neither of them care. Mitch tells Brody he has to earn his job, and Brody tells him off.Meanwhile, Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra), the new owner of the beach's Huntley Club, is meeting with Councilman Rodriguez (Oscar Nunez) over a real estate deal. In exchange for his services, Leeds gives him a new watch that her men wear.Ronnie is on the beach with Dave eating baby carrots when he sees CJ again. He starts to choke, leading CJ to perform the Heimlich on him. Ronnie spits out the carrot but he also has an erection. Before CJ can see it, Ronnie jumps onto a wooden lawn chair and gets his whole groin stuck between the boards. Things get worse when Mitch comes over to help, as observes Ronnie's got both his ""beef and biscuits"" stuck in there. Other beachgoers show up and start filming him. When Mitch opts to pull it out like a tooth, Ronnie tries running but instead falls face-first, breaking the chair and getting unstuck.Mitch rounds up all the new hopeful lifeguards to begin their test in the obstacle course. Brody sits it out as he feels he doesn't have to do it. Summer gives it her all and passes through the course, though Ronnie struggles at first due to being heavier than the others. Still, he refuses to give up and keeps going, which Mitch takes notice of. By the end of the day, Mitch announces Summer, Ronnie, and Brody as his new trainees.Mitch puts Brody through his own specialized course, which involves ridiculous tasks such as lifting large truck tires and hauling refrigerators like weights. Nearby on the pier, two young children fall into the water and their mother jumps in after them. Mitch, Steph, and CJ head in to rescue them while Brody follows and tries to be a hero. He goes to rescue the mother but she keeps smacking him. Mitch and CJ rescue the kids and Steph rides them to safety. Brody just ends up looking foolish.Mitch goes to Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) to complain about Brody. Thorpe tells Mitch that Brody is a well-known skilled swimmer, but he lost it all when he puked in the pool during a race after a night of hard partying. His position on the team is part of a community service deal, as well as a ploy to make sure the Bay doesn't lose its funding, so Mitch has to work with Brody whether he likes it or not.At night, Summer and CJ find Brody sleeping under the pier. CJ takes him to find a place to crash, making him think she is taking him to Steph's home, but he is really going to be staying with Mitch. Mitch lets him stay and makes him sleep on a couch next to a fish tank with a mini-figure of Mitch ""watching"" him.Brody begins training under Mitch across the beach. He nearly steps on a poisonous sea urchin until Mitch points it out.On the water, Rodriguez tells Leeds that he made arrangements with his people for the real estate deal, but because he did not deliver on time, Leeds has her two thugs Frankie (Amin Joseph) and Leon (Jack Kesy) come around to intimidate Rodriguez. He tries to call Leeds's bluff by saying he knows about her pushing drugs. She leaves her men to deal with Rodriguez.As the guys continue their training, Leeds drives up and has Mitch introduce her. She invites the whole team to an open house that night at the Huntley. Not long after she leaves, Steph answers a call about a yacht burning up on the beach. The whole team, including the trainees, rush out there to find the burning boat. Mitch hops on the boat and rescues three women but also finds an unconscious man. Brody dives under the water to try and help, but he gets caught under the fire. Steph uses her jet ski to splash water around the fire while Summer pulls Brody out. When they get back to the shore, they find that the man they pulled out is dead, and it's Rodriguez. Ellerbee shows up, and Mitch tries to talk about what they've investigated, but Ellerbee tells him to stay out of what is a police matter.We see that Dave is working for Leeds as her tech guy. He attempts to blackmail her so that he doesn't say anything about Rodriguez's murder. She has something else in mind.The team sits down to have lunch and discuss the fact that a dead body has turned up, in addition to finding more Flaca on the women they rescued (they were high off the stuff). They decide to attend the open house to get any more information on Leeds that they can get.That evening, the team goes ""undercover"" at the open house party. They assign Brody to be lookout to have eyes on Leeds. He does manage to get Leeds alone but he doesn't get any information because he's more focused on getting drunk. Ronnie distracts Leeds while the others go to work by doing a crazy dance that gets CJ's attention. Mitch then goes to confront Brody over his failure at his task. Brody curses Mitch out and tells him he's just a lifeguard. Mitch humiliates Brody further by scaring him into falling into a pool, where he pukes again and everyone sees. Brody plays it off by telling everyone do shots, but he passes out.Meanwhile, Frankie and Leon take Dave's dead body on a boat out to the sea and slather him with meat chunks as they dump him in there to be shark food.The next morning, Mitch tells Brody that he is great at what he does when he's on his own, but when it comes to working as part of a team, he fails to do so because he is selfish and only cares about himself. Brody begs for a second chance and tells Mitch and Summer that he noticed Rodriguez wearing the watch that Leeds's goons wear.The trio head to the morgue to continue their investigation by disguising themselves as hospital staff. In the morgue, they find Rodriguez's corpse and autopsy files. They see that there was no smoke in his lungs, which means he died before the boat caught fire. Mitch orders Brody to look under Rodriguez's scrotum for anything, but it's just an opportunity by Mitch to further humiliate Brody by getting pics of Brody looking at a dead guy's taint. Summer sees Frankie and Leon approaching. The three hide in the drawers, but Brody ends up hiding on top of a dead old lady. To make things worse, he has fat from a corpse dripping on his face. The goons then open up Rodriguez's drawer and swap out an autopsy file to make it look like he did die from the fire. Brody then freaks out when the fat drips into his mouth, so he jumps out and gets hand sanitizer on his mouth. They are further exposed when Summer's phone rings. Leon grabs the phone and runs out with Frankie.Leon tosses Summer's phone to Frankie. Mitch goes after Frankie while Brody and Summer try to catch Leon. Mitch chases Frankie on a jet ski and finds him trying to break into a family's home. The two fight in a little girl's bedroom after Frankie breaks the phone until Mitch puts a diaper bin on Frankie's head and knocks him out the window into the pool.Mitch, Brody, and Summer all meet with Sergeant Ellerbee as he angrily tells them to stop getting involved in the case. Captain Thorpe also shows up as the three try explaining that they did have evidence against Leeds's men, but all the evidence has been destroyed. Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he continues his investigation. Frankie gets away with everything after complaining to the police over Mitch's actions.Mitch observes the Huntley getting their fish from another company, which he thinks is how they are smuggling Flaca onto the beach. He and Brody go undercover and sneak into the Huntley's kitchen where they find Leeds's men handling drugs. Mitch calls Ellerbee to report, but Ellerbee is tied up with having found Dave's body being partially torn up by sharks. Ellerbee also has Thorpe listen to Mitch calling.Thorpe calls Mitch into his office to fire him. He appoints Brody to be the new lieutenant, but Mitch tells Thorpe that the position should go to Stephanie since she knows the beach just as well as he does. Thorpe doesn't care for Mitch's opinion and dismisses him. Although Brody tries to decline the offer, Thorpe threatens him with a bad record for his community service. The others aren't happy with Brody taking the position, despite his attempts to defend himself.Brody starts to handle things on the beach despite not having everyone's support. He catches a punk on the beach stealing people's stuff with a cooler that pulls things in. He tackles the thief and scares him away. When he opens the cooler, Brody finds a bag of Flaca. He then asks Steph and CJ to help give back everyone's things.Brody goes to Ellerbee's office to give him a chocolate smoothie but also to use the cooler to take a file off his desk without him knowing.Mitch takes a new job at a phone store and cuts off connection with the rest of his team. When he looks ready to give up, he is approached by his old mentor...the original Mitch (David Hasselhoff). He inspires Mitch to keep up his work and to not give up on himself or his people.Brody approaches Summer with the file, showing Dave's corpse. Ronnie sees the pics and recognizes Dave. He tells the others that Dave mentioned working with Leeds. Ronnie later shows Brody how he can hack into Leeds's servers, leading them to discover Leeds's ultimate plan - she wants to privatize the beach so that she can eliminate competition and spread drugs around undetected. The guys tell the ladies about this plan and they come together to stop Leeds.The team infiltrates Leeds's yacht during a party. Steph, CJ, and Ronnie find Murray Chen (Clem Cheung), a real estate guy that Leeds kidnapped as part of her scheme. Meanwhile, Brody swims under the boat and finds that Leeds has been smuggling drugs in the hull. Brody resurfaces to tell Summer to get in touch with Brody. When he gets back on the boat, he gets knocked out by Frankie.The goons take Brody on another boat and lock him in a cage. Before she can kill Brody, she tells him that she bribed Thorpe to set Mitch up so he would get fired and get him off her back. She pushes the cage into the water, which Ronnie and CJ see. Just as Brody appears to accept his fate, he is pulled out of the cage. He sees Summer reviving him, but it's really Mitch, to Brody's disgust.Leeds is preparing to get away on a helicopter. Mitch tells Ronnie to work the fireworks display to throw the helicopter pilot's sight off. Ronnie panics at first but gets confidence after CJ kisses him. As the fireworks go off, Mitch and Brody fight Frankie and Leon again. Frankie gets knocked into the water while Leeds shoots Leon dead for his incompetence. The guys go after her but she shoots Mitch in the shoulder and he falls into the water. He gets back up as Leeds holds Brody at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Ronnie and CJ find a big red button. Ronnie flips the switch, and Mitch notices the lights near him activating. Brody hits Leeds's gun, making her run out of bullets as Mitch grabs a Roman candle, says a one-liner, and waits for Ronnie to hit the button to launch the firework at Leeds, obliterating her. Mitch then reveals he got up by using a sea urchin to boost his adrenaline, but he is in need of medical attention.Back on the shore, Mitch gets treated, and Ellerbee shows up to apologize to Mitch for doubting his claims. Thorpe shows up to try and berate Mitch, but Brody punches him in the face, and Ellerbee arrests Thorpe and Frankie.Later on, Ronnie and CJ hook up, and Brody and Summer appear to start a relationship as well. They join Mitch and Stephanie as Mitch officially instates the trainees as lifeguards on the Bay. He then introduces them to their new captain, Casey Jean (Pamela Anderson), who enters in slow-mo.The film ends with the team doing their own slow-mo run on the beach, only for Brody to tumble hard on the sand.A series of bloopers and outtakes play during the closing credits, ending with both Mitches sitting on the beach as Hasselhoff-Mitch asks Rock-Mitch if he can be in the sequel."
The Shack,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872518/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A grieving man receives a mysterious, personal invitation to meet with God at a place called ""The Shack."" After the abduction and presumed death of Mackenzie Allen Phillips' youngest daughter, Missy, Mack receives a letter and suspects it is from God, asking him to return to The Shack where Missy may have been murdered. After contemplating it, he leaves his home to go to The Shack for the first time since Missy's abduction and an encounter that will change his life forever. What would have been a fun weekend of camping for a man and his three children turns into a horrid nightmare that will forever change them all. Some time later, he receives a note inviting him to the same shack where the nightmare began. This invitation will bring him face to face with God, where God's manifestations appear in the most nontraditional forms.—Edgard Martinez When he was a 13-year-old boy, Mack killed his abusive and alcoholic father with strychnine in his booze. Years later, Mack Phillips is happily married with Nan and they have three children -- Kate, Josh and the girl Missy Phillips. While on a camping weekend with his family, Missy is criminally abducted and killed, destroying Mack's life. One day, he receives a note from God, whom his dead daughter called Papa, asking him to visit the shack where his daughter was killed. He meets Jesus, Sarayu and Sophia and has an experience of discoveries and redemption.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Mack Phillips is happily married with three children. When a family tragedy shatters their carefree existence, Mack becomes bitter and depressed and the family starts to drift apart. Out of the blue, he receives an invitation to return to where the tragedy took place, a deserted cabin known simply as The Shack. The thing is -- the invitation is from God.—grantss A 13-year-old boy named Mackenzie ""Mack"" Phillips disembarks from a school bus and runs home. He is a farm boy in the Midwest USA. When he gets home, he sees his father abusing his mother. When Mack tries to defend her, his father turns on him. Mack's father is a church deacon and a closeted alcoholic. Mack walks past the house of a woman who offers him milk and cookies. She advises him to talk to God and tells Mack that he's done nothing wrong.That Sunday at church, he gains the courage to go up to the alter and ask for prayer. He confesses to the elder that he is sorry for not being able to protect his mother. Later that night at home, Mack's drunk father beats him during a rainstorm, making him recite Bible verses. We see Mack contemplating poisoning his father by pouring strychnine into his alcoholic drink. It is not made clear how this was resolved or if Mack went through with the plan, though a lack of any subsequent guilt ascribed to it implies that he did not.We flash forward and see an adult Mack having a fulfilling life with his wife and children. It is winter and Mack is shoveling the snow. He receives an unstamped and typewritten letter in his mailbox signed by ""Papa,"" which is his wife's nickname for God, telling him he misses him and inviting him to the shack.Mack slips on the ice and has a flashback to he, his wife Nan, and their three children (Kate, Josh and Missy) going on a camping trip. Mack tells his children, especially Missy, his youngest daughter, a story about a princess sacrificing herself to help save the people of her land. The waterfall they look at, Multnomah Falls, are the tears of the princess's father.As they sing around the campfire with another group that evening, Missy runs and tells Mack that he has to say his prayers to Papa. He goes to pray with her, even though it's not his thing. She asks many profound questions about God. Next day, Missy draws the princess while Kate and Josh paddle in a canoe. After Kate stands up, the canoe tips over and Josh is trapped underneath. Mack dives into the lake to save Josh, and other campers help Mack pull Josh to safety. Josh survives after CPR is administered, but when Mack returns, he finds that Missy has disappeared.After a search of the campsite proves to be unsuccessful, the police are called to the scene. They tell Mack that there is a man the FBI has been after for years who abducts young girls and may be responsible. The town is put on alert with the FBI and community members gathered in the school gym preparing to search. Mack blames himself but Nan keeps telling him it's not his fault. The Feds tell him they found a truck in the woods and they have to go, with Mack going with them. They arrive at a shack and Missy's clothes are there with blood.Flash forward: Mack wakes up on the ice and accuses his best friend Willie (Tim McGraw) of sending the letter. He goes to the post office, but there isn't any information. In his car, he thinks about Missy's funeral. He meets with Willie and talks to him more about the note. Willie asks Mack if he's prayed about it. Mack thinks it's a bad idea because it could be the killer trying to get him out there. Willie says maybe it's God and insists on going with him. Meanwhile, Nan decides to take Kate to see her family as she has become withdrawn. Nan is afraid of losing Mack.Mack and Willie are all ready to go. The car is packed, with a gun included just in case... Mack sends Willie to fetch his tackle box then drives off in Willie's own car, leaving Willie behind. On the way, he hears the voices of his friends and family and almost gets into an accident with a semi-trailer after hearing Missy's voice. On his arrival at the shack he enters, gun in hand, ready to shoot in case the murderer is there. He starts talking to him, as if he was there, yelling about how he didn't even have her body to bury, and then starts running around the shack yelling and slamming things. Again he is ready to shoot when he hears a noise, but it is just a deer on the porch. He ventures outside and sees a man. The man is very friendly, even with Mack's gun pointed at him, and invites him inside to warm himself up by the fire. He tells Mack he has someone there that would love to see him. As they walk, the snow disappears and suddenly the path and woods are beautiful and warm, the sun shines, and the wilderness looks more like summer than winter.Mack approaches the shack and enters what is a large beautiful home. The woman is there, looking exactly the same as she did when Mack was a child. She is ""Papa"" (God the Father), the man Mack followed is her son Jesus, and the other woman there, named Sarayu, is the Holy Spirit. Mack leaves, thinking he is crazy, but Jesus approaches him telling him he dropped his invitation (the letter from Papa). He goes back inside and Papa tells him how much she loves him. He is surprised as she is a woman. She tells Mack that she took on the appearance of a woman because he couldn't handle a father right now. He asks her why she forsook him, and where she has been.Over dinner he tells them that his son Josh is doing well and has a girlfriend, but his daughter Kate not so much. They talk to him about how much they love him and want to get to know him, even though they already do. While he sleeps, he has visions of his daughter being kidnapped. In the morning, he talks to Papa over breakfast about how she punishes people. She tells him she doesn't punish people, because their sin is punishment enough, and everything she does works together for good. He accuses her of lying, due to all the pain and suffering in the world; however, she tells him the reality is that he doesn't see the whole picture. He doesn't believe she is good but he has to learn to trust her. He says there is nothing that she could say that would justify Missy's death. He gets up and leaves into the woods, but Sarayu approaches him with directions to his truck and the keys. She tells him they aren't justifying anything but are there to help heal it. She tells him she needs help in the garden preparing for the next day. She tells him that the poisonous plant (representing evil in the world), when combined with the right plant, creates healing powers. After a long conversation with her, Jesus tells Mack he can take the boat out if he wants.Jesus sends Mack out on the lake to see something on the other side. As Mack has flashbacks of the tragic day, the boat ruptures and starts to sink. From shore, Jesus tells him not to panic and ""just keep your eyes on me."" Jesus walks on water to meet him, and the boat returns to its intact state. Jesus tells Mack to get out of the boat and walk with him, but Mack insists he will sink. Jesus assures Mack that he won't if he just trusts him.After walking across the lake, they get back on land, Jesus points out a path for Mack to follow and will wait for him there. The path leads Mack to the stone face of a mountain. He passdes through and meets Sophia, who introduces herself as Wisdom. They talk about judgment and she tells Mack that HE is the one who judges every one based on their clothes, appearance, etc. She tells him he has to judge people and sits him down. He sees visions on the wall of his mother and himself getting beaten by his father and then sees a vision of his father as a little boy getting beaten. Cut to him seeing the visions again of his little girl being taken away. She asks him if God is to blame and he says yes.Wisdom says that if it is so easy for Mack to judge God, than he must choose one of his surviving children to go to Heaven and the other to Hell, since that's what he believes God does. She gives him reasons why he could pick either one. He tries to leave saying it isn't fair and he can't choose, but she keeps saying he must. He says that he will go (to Hell) instead of them and take their place. She tells him that's what Papa goes through. There's no such thing as a pain-free life. As long as there is free will, evil will be invited in. The cave wall opens to the back of a waterfall, through which he sees Missy playing with other children. Sensing her father's presence, Missy runs to the waterfall and blows him a kiss. He asks if Missy forgives him for not saving her. Sophia tells him that Missy never felt that way.Back at the beach, Mack and Jesus run through the water. That evening, Papa, Jesus and Sarayu take Mack to the top of a hill. Sarayu covers Mack's eyes, and when he opens them he sees people glowing as the others see people in color and light. One is walking towards them, and it's Mack's father. He apologizes to Mack and says he was blind and couldn't see anyone. Mack says he was scared and they forgive one another.In the morning, Papa comes to Mack, now as an American Indian man. Papa brings Mack to the woods and wants him to forgive Missy's killer. Mack says he wants to hurt him, and he wants God to hurt him also. God tells him that the killer is also his son, and he wants to redeem him. Mack says the man should burn in Hell, but Papa reminds him that he is not the judge. He guides him into forgiveness, and tells him that it's OK that he is still mad, and it will get easier in time. Papa leads Mack to Missy's body, which he wraps and carries back to the shack. Mack asks Jesus to take her as he can't, and they put her in a coffin and bring it to the garden for burial. Beautiful flowers grow above the grave, along with a rapidly growing tree that attracts butterflies. Mack is ready to go home. Papa, Jesus and Sarayu, however, tell him that he needs to talk to Kate, as she blames herself for Missy's death. Given the choice to stay with the trinity forever or return home (they'll always be with him either way), Mack tells them that he still wants them in his life but decides to return home.Suddenly, it is winter again. On Mack's way home, he is hit by the semi-trailer at the same intersection and winds up in the hospital. Willie is there and tells him that he never made it to the shack and was hit by the semi that night on the way there. His family comes into the room and he tells Nan that he saw Missy and she's beautiful. He talks to Kate, who tells him that she feels Missy's death was her fault because she stood up on the boat causing it to tip over in the first place. He tells her nothing is her fault and she doesn't have to go through grieving alone. His life turns around and the family are all able to have a happy life once again."
Darkest Hour,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555426/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs onWinston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate withAdolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire. During World War II, asAdolf Hitler's powerful Wehrmacht rampages across Europe, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,Neville Chamberlain, is forced to resign, recommendingWinston Churchillas his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with Hitler or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Churchill has no choice but to shine in the country's darkest hour.—Nick Riganas A thrilling and inspiring true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within a few days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, SirWinston Churchill(Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty, and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.—Jwelch5742 In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party advisers that he wants Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane) as his successor, but Halifax does not feel the time is right. Chamberlain is forced to choose the only man who the opposition parties will accept: Sir Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), the First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) for hearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas). King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), who strongly distrusts Churchill, reluctantly invites him to form a government. Churchill includes Chamberlain (as Lord President of the Council) and Halifax (as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). It's May 1940, the early stages of WWII. The Germans are advancing west on the continent, and British Prime MinisterNeville Chamberlainhas lost the confidence of the House in his response. The Conservative party's first choice as a replacement leader isE.F.L. Wood- Viscount Halifax - who believes the timing is not right for him, and as such the party reluctantly choosesWinston Churchillas the new leader who the party members know the opposition supports. To keep his party opponents close, Churchill appoints both Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax to his War Cabinet. Conversely, Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax believe they can either manipulate Churchill into doing what they want or use his failure for Viscount Halifax to make a high profile public move to sweep into power. While Churchill initially holds steadfast to his beliefs, he becomes under increasing pressure, especially at Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax's wants, to enter into peace negotiations withAdolf Hitlerled by Hitler's ally,Benito Mussolini, with probably less than favorable terms in being behind the eight-ball. What looks to be the probable result of not negotiating are massive British troop casualties in they being cornered on the French coast as the Germans advance, and the imminent German invasion of Britain. If Churchill decides not to negotiate, is there any way for him to turn things around?—Huggo In May 1940, a million German troops are at the Belgian border with the intent to conquer the rest of Europe. In Britain, Parliament has lost faith in their current prime minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and are already looking to find his replacement.Every member of Parliament clamors in anger over Chamberlain's apparent inability to lead them as World War II has already begun, citing him as incompetent. What they want is a leader who can form a coalition party. During a dinner, the men gathered are all in favor of Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to be the new prime minister but, while Halifax is grateful for the consideration, he claims his time has not yet come. Chamberlain then states that there is only one other man who will be accepted... and nobody else is pleased at this thought.Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) is beginning her first day of work as secretary to Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman). As she enters his room, Churchill orders Elizabeth to start typing out a telegram to the French ambassador. He then receives a phone call from the ambassador himself to inform Churchill that the German troops have already invaded Holland and Belgium. Churchill tells Elizabeth to start a new telegram to General Hastings Ismay (Richard Lumsden) in light of the recent news. Churchill then becomes critical of Elizabeth's work, wherein he proceeds to yell and insult her, driving her out of the room in tears. Elizabeth runs into Churchill's wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), who is aware of what just happened. She goes to their bedroom to tell her husband that he has become rude and overbearing, and she would like others to love and respect him the way she does.Churchill receives an official telegram from King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) inviting him to meet at Buckingham Palace. George and Chamberlain are meeting prior to Churchill's arrival, with George having a lack of enthusiasm for having to pick Churchill, but Chamberlain says it's because Churchill was the only one with full support from the opposition. Once Churchill gets there, George officially offers him the position of prime minister.Churchill begins his term as prime minister by addressing the members of Parliament. In his speech, he tells the men that he has already begun to form his coalition, and that he plans to wage war against the enemy to ensure victory at all costs and by any means necessary, counter to the previous discussions of peace talks with Germany. The men are visibly not confident.Lord Halifax sits with Chamberlain outside after Churchill's speech. Halifax expresses his doubts over Churchill's capabilities as a leader. Chamberlain tells Halifax that he has cancer and fears he may not live to see his country at peace. Halifax comes up with a plan to try and get Churchill out by trying to have a vote of no confidence so that Chamberlain's policies may be reinstated. Chamberlain says they must get a written agreement from Churchill stating he will not agree to peace talks.Churchill is informed that 300,000 British troops are stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk. The concern is sending in more troops to rescue those stranded. Churchill wants to keep this news from the public for now and is concerned about keeping France safe.Churchill is frequently criticized by the other members of Parliament. Halifax meets with King George personally to discuss removing Churchill from his position.Churchill addresses the nation over the radio, trying to assure the people that they will conquer their enemies. However, when he returns home, he tells Clementine he lied and that they are basically in full retreat. Clementine defends his actions by saying he would have done no good putting fear into everyone's thoughts.Churchill is photographed making a backwards V sign in what he thinks means ""victory"", but Elizabeth informs him that in some parts of the country, the way he's doing it means ""up your bum"". The two share a hearty laugh over it.Over the matter of the troops on Dunkirk, it is reported that just about all the British troops are stranded. After being informed of a nearby garrison, Churchill opts to send 4,000 men to rescue the other 300,000. The other members think it's a suicide mission, but Churchill asserts his position and wants to go through with the evacuation plan. Churchill later calls President Franklin Roosevelt to ask if the U.S. may send 50 or 40 destroyers for help, but new laws prohibit Roosevelt from allowing it. Churchill then contacts Admiral Bertram Ramsay to allow for as many civilian boats as possible to be sent out for the evacuation. This would be known as Operation Dynamo.During another meeting with other lords, the subject of peace talks is brought up again. Churchill argues fiercely with Halifax over their opposing views on how to handle the ongoing war. Halifax gives Churchill 24 hours to negotiate peace talks, or he will resign.Churchill has Elizabeth write out a telegram confirming that an evacuation will not take place, which visibly distresses her. She asks just how many men may survive. Churchill walks her to a map to illustrate the severity of the situation.Churchill is informed that Belgium has surrendered, and France is set to follow suit. Churchill and his colleagues are urged to prepare for a possibly imminent invasion to their islands. It is then stated that Italy is willing to mediate peace talks between Britain, its allies, and Germany. Backed into a corner, Churchill has no choice but to agree to consider peace talks with Hitler, so long as he allows Britain to maintain its independence.Elizabeth is typing out another telegram for Churchill, but she stops because she can't understand him due to his constant mumbling. Churchill then notices Elizabeth has a photo of a man, whom she says is her brother. She tells Churchill that he was falling back on Dunkirk but did not make it. He then understands her earlier distress with the Dunkirk situation.King George visits Churchill over Mussolini's desire to barter with Hitler. George expresses his support for Churchill and says that while many were dreading his appointment as prime minister, none were more afraid than Hitler, as he believes Churchill has caused him to grow concern over his own position.Churchill speaks to Ramsay again and is told they will send 860 vessels to Dunkirk, thereby initiating Dynamo.Churchill takes the subway with civilians on his trip to Westminster in the West End of London. Many are in awe of seeing Churchill among them. One passenger lights his cigar for him. Churchill continues to mingle with everyone, showing a friendly and pleasant side to himself. Everyone appears to be in support of his stance to fight against the enemy instead of bowing to their will. Churchill is moved to tears by everyone's support before he exits the train.Ultimately, Churchill decides completely against negotiating peace talks. In one more speech to Parliament, he addresses the possibility of invasion by the German army, but that they will fight on the beaches to the end so that victory may be inevitable. The members wave their handkerchiefs in approval of Churchill.The final text states that almost all the 300,000 troops were rescued from Dunkirk by Churchill's civilian fleet. The former prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, died six months later from cancer. Halifax was removed from the war cabinet and sent to Washington. Five years later on May 5th, Britain and its allies declared victory. Churchill was voted out of office in the general election later that year. A final quote from the man reads, ""Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts."""
Happy Death Day,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5308322/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that will end only when she discovers her killer's identity. A teenage girl, trying to enjoy her birthday, soon realizes that this is her final one. That is, if she can figure out who her killer is. She must relive that day, over and over again, dying in a different way each time. Can she solve her own murder? After a night of hard-partying and heavy-drinking, the self-centered college student and sorority sister, Tree Gelbman, wakes up on the morning of her birthday with a serious hangover, in the dorm of a guy whose name she can't recall. As Tree goes about her day, little does she know that everything that happens now or will occur during the course of the day, is a twisted déjà vu of a reality that repeats itself again and again, until her brutal murder at night by a masked madman. With every repetition--or better yet resurrection--Tree gets a little bit closer to the identity of her unknown killer; however, figuring out who he or she may be, always ends up with Tree's death. Wake up; figure out the killer; die; repeat. After all, practice makes perfect.—Nick Riganas After drunken partying the previous evening, university student Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis. She ignores a phone call from her father David and dismisses Carter while leaving his room and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her sorority housemate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot - a baby. Tree immediately wakes up in the same way she had previously - in Carter's bed - and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes that she is in a time loop and barricades herself in her sorority house room to avoid death. The killer, however, is already hiding there and slays her a third time.. The film opens as the bell tolls at Bayfield University on Monday the 18th. Teresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) wakes up hungover on her birthday in the dorm room of schoolmate Carter Davis (Israel Broussard). She ignores a phone call from her father. After asking for Tylenol, Tree starts to head out and sees Carter's roommate Ryan (Phi Vu) coming in and asking if he slept with her, to her disgust and Carter's embarrassment.On her way to her own room, Tree runs into a guy she went out with named Tim (Caleb Spillyards). He asks Tree why she hasn't answered his texts, and she says because their one date involved them going to Subway and it made her miserable. Tree goes to her room and sees her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine). Tree realizes she is late for class and frantically gets ready. Lori then presents her with a cupcake she baked for Tree. Tree blows out the candle and dumps the cupcake in the trash because of the carbs.Tree goes to her class and later meets with her professor, Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken). The two are having an affair despite Gregory being married. His wife Stephanie (Laura Clifton) is at the door after Tree kept it budged.Tree joins her sorority sisters during lunch for a meeting regarding a spring dance. The head sister, Danielle Bouseman (Rachel Matthews), chastises another sister, Becky (Cariella Smith), for bringing junk food to eat. Becky gets up to leave and bumps into Carter, causing Becky to spill her food all over Tree. Carter tries to return Tree some jewelry she left behind, but Tree pulls him aside to keep hiding the fact that she slept in his room.Danielle invites Tree to a party at a dorm later that evening. Tree heads through the campus alone and passes a group of guys wearing the school's sports team merchandise (they're the ""Babies""). As she heads past a bridge, she hears the sound of a music box. Tree goes over to pick up the box and sees someone with a baby mask standing a few feet in front of her. She threatens to call the cops, and the person runs. Tree starts to leave but is then chased by the masked person. They eventually catch Tree and stab her to death.Tree wakes up in Carter's room at the beginning of the same day. Clearly freaked out and confused, she leaves the room and thinks she is going through deja vu. She goes to her room and once again rejects Lori's cupcake, but this time just leaves it instead of dumping it. Stephanie catches her in Gregory's office after it's been locked. During lunch, Tree warns Becky before Carter bumps into her, but the same things still happen.Tree heads over to the party again, but this time avoids the bridge. She goes to the dorm and is greeted by someone with the baby mask, causing her to scream and punch the person in the face. It turns out to be Nick (Blaine Kern III), Danielle's boyfriend. It's a surprise party for Tree. She goes around drinking and trying to enjoy herself. She goes up to Nick's room where he messes around with the mask for a bit. However, the real killer shows up in the room and stabs Nick to death. When she's not looking, Tree gets a text from Danielle, accusing her of hooking up with Nick behind her back, and implying it's happened before. Tree is attacked by the killer, who takes her out with a broken bong piece.Tree wakes up in Carter's room again. She's even more freaked out this time. She runs to her room and tells Lori that someone is after her. Lori calms her down and suggests she take the day off and relax in her room. Tree locks up the room and puts up boards to prevent anyone from getting in. Later that night, the killer breaks in anyway. Tree fights the killer off but is still stabbed to death.After going through the same things again, Tree explains her situation to Carter, who is understandably confused. He suggests that she narrow down her list of suspects until she can find out who the killer is. Carter thinks the killer may be specifically targeting Tree on her birthday, which means everyone at school is a suspect since Danielle told everyone about the surprise party.Tree goes through several loops as she goes after her suspects. She first goes after Tim, but catches him in his room looking at gay porn. After dying again, she suspects Stephanie, but she spots Stephanie moments before the killer drowns her. She suspects Danielle but ends up dying on her own after the two get into a fight and they get hit by a bus.After crossing off those names, Tree suspects Gregory might be the killer. She looks for him in the hospital after getting an x-ray taken to find that she has sustained internal damage from her previous deaths. While going through Gregory's office, Tree finds a baby mask in his drawer. However, the killer stabs Gregory and then chases Tree into the parking lot. She takes a car and gets out. As she excitedly thinks she escaped death, a cop pulls her over for speeding. Tree lies and says she's drunk and high so that she can be in a cell and avoid the killer. When she's cuffed and put in the back of the car, the killer drives past and hits the cop. The gas tank starts leaking, so the killer drops a birthday candle to ignite the fuel and blow Tree up.Tree wakes up in Carter's room yet again. She proves she knows what's going to happen by pointing out some things that she's been noticing frequently, like a car alarm going off, sprinklers being set off on studying students, and a group of activists standing together while one member drops to the ground.Carter takes Tree to the nearby burger place as she is now getting weaker with each new loop. She's getting worried that she may be running out of lives. Tree mentions avoiding her dad's phone calls and tells Carter that her mom passed away three years earlier. Moments later, they then see a news report on TV about a serial killer named Joseph Tombs (Rob Mello), who is notorious for going after young women. Tree believes he's the killer and that she can finally stop him.Tree and Carter run to the hospital to stop Tombs, but he has already killed the security guard and escaped. Tree grabs a fire axe and tries to run from Tombs. Carter protects Tree, but Tombs snaps his neck. Tree manages to incapacitate Tombs, but realizes that if she succeeds in stopping the loops, Carter will stay dead. She runs to the top of the bell tower before Tombs can catch her, and she hangs herself, promising to find Tombs soon.Tree starts the new loop with more positive energy. She greets Carter warmly, warns the students about the sprinklers, and is friendly to Lori when she goes to her room. When Tim approaches her, she kindly tells him she knows he doesn't like girls and that he should be free to love who he really wants. Tree goes to Gregory's class and interrupts his lecture to pull him out and tell him she is breaking things off between them, and that she's dropped his class. During the lunch meeting, Tree shows up with a tray full of junk food and proudly scarfs it down. Although Danielle tries to send Becky away, Tree doesn't let her leave, and instead takes Becky's chocolate milk to pour on Danielle's head, humiliating her. Carter then comes by to return Tree's jewelry, and she kisses him in front of the other sisters. She then invites Carter to join her later that night for her birthday.Tree goes to have lunch with her dad David (Jason Bayle). She admits to him that it's been hard to be around him since her mother died, but she says she loves him and is sorry for hurting him. The two then laugh to lighten the mood and they have lunch.Tree prepares herself to go after Tombs. She goes up to the security guard with a knife and takes his gun before telling him to go get backup. Tree then walks into Tombs' room and aims the gun at him as he pretends to be asleep. She tries to shoot him but she forgot to take the safety off. Tombs gets up and fights Tree, brutally slamming her against the wall. Tree then remembers that a brief blackout is supposed to occur, which happens at the right moment for her to escape Tombs's line of sight. She appears behind him and takes the safety off, allowing her to shoot Tombs dead.Tree and Carter spend the rest of the night together, and she eats the cupcake Lori made her after she blows it out and makes a wish.Tree wakes up once more in Carter's room. The birthday ringtone plays. It's still Monday the 18th. She becomes confused and angry, wondering how she could still be stuck in the loop. She runs to her room to find Lori, who offers her the cupcake again. Tree declines it and says she ate it the night before...and then it hits her. She died in her sleep, which is because the cupcake was poisoned all along. She never ate the cupcake anytime before, so she realizes Lori was the killer the whole time. Since she works at the hospital, Lori was able to set Tombs loose and make it look like he killed Tree due to his history. To drive the point home even further, Tree finds the baby mask in Lori's desk. Tree tries to make Lori eat the cupcake and even threatens to bring it to the police. Lori comes clean and says this was all because a guy she likes was more into Tree, which Tree thinks is a stupid motive, as well as Lori saying Tree's a ""dumb bitch"". The two start fighting as Lori tries to finish Tree off for good. They are interrupted by Danielle from outside the room as Lori has Tree pinned to the bed, but Tree manages to grab the cupcake and shove it in Lori's mouth. Tree then jumps up and grabs the ceiling lamp so she can kick Lori out the window to her death.Tree and Carter are in a diner watching the news report on the incident, with Danielle doing an interview just for the publicity. Carter starts to tell Tree that her situation reminds him of ""Groundhog Day"", but she's never heard of it or Bill Murray.Tree wakes up and hears the birthday ringtone again. Carter acts like she's just waking up hungover again. Tree starts to freak out, until Carter reveals he was just pranking her and it's officially Tuesday the 19th. They laugh about it and kick Ryan out when he tries to come back inside before they start kissing."

THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a darkly comic drama from Academy Award nominee Martin McDonagh (In Bruges). After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Academy Award winner Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When Dixon, one of his officers (Academy Award winner Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated.—Fox Searchlight Pictures In an effort to track down who raped and murdered her daughter, Mildred Hayes has three billboards erected outside her town of Ebbing, Missouri. They accuse the Sheriff of doing nothing to catch the killer. This causes a largely adverse, and diverse, reaction amongst the town's folk, not least of all the sheriff's deputy, the hot-headed, irascible Jason Dixon.—grantss It's been already seven months since her daughter's hideous murder, and the divorced mother, Mildred Hayes, is still grieving, refusing to come to terms with her loss. In Mildred's case, nothing seems to be able to take away the gut-wrenching pain only a mother feels when she loses a child; however, in one of those spur-of-the-moment decisions, the plucky parent will rent three derelict billboards on the outskirts of her town, Ebbing, to declare war against the local police for failing to find the killer. No one is spared in this brave crusade, not even the ailing police chief, Willoughby, as Mildred's bold black-on-red statements demand answers and the culprit's head on a platter. Just how far is Mildred willing to go to appease her rage?—Nick Riganas The story takes place entirely in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, where a girl was raped and murdered a few months ago. The mother, Mildred Hayes, believes that the local police did nothing to find the killer, so she rents three billboards in order to challenge them to search deeper. This leads to many complex situations that involve tragedy, anger, hate, love, redemption and broken characters.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is grieving the sexual assault and murder of her teenage daughter Angela (Kathryn Newton) seven months prior. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three abandoned billboards near her home, which in sequence read ""R***D WHILE DYING"", ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS?"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and racist officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). The open secret that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to their disapproval (in addition to Willoughby being a good man). Mildred and her depressed son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) are harassed and threatened, but she stays firm, to Robbie's chagrin.
While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he finds the billboards an unfair attack on his character. Angered by Mildred's lack of respect for his authority, Dixon threatens Red (Caleb Landry Jones), who rented her the billboards, and arrests her friend and coworker, Denise (Amanda Warren), on trivial marijuana-possession charges. Mildred is also visited by her abusive ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes), who blames her for their daughter's death.Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she injures her dentist in an altercation in his clinic. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood. He leaves the hospital against medical advice and spends an idyllic day with his wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) and daughters, before committing suicide. He leaves suicide notes for several people, including one to Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide, and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble this will bring her. Mildred is threatened by a stranger in her store. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Red and his assistant. This is witnessed by Willoughby's replacement, Abercrombie (Clarke Peters), who fires him.
The billboards are destroyed by arson. Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes is unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is there to read a letter left for him by Willoughby, advising him to let go of hate and learn to love as the only way to realize his wish to become a detective. Dixon escapes with Angela's case files, suffering severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James (Peter Dinklage) witnesses the incident and provides Mildred with an alibi, claiming they were on a date.Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who threatened Mildred bragging in a bar of an incident similar to Angela's murder. He notes the Idaho license plate number of the man's vehicle, then provokes a fight. At home, he removes a sample of the man's DNA. Meanwhile, Mildred goes on a date to thank James for the alibi; Charlie enters with his 19-year old girlfriend Penelope (Samara Weaving), and admits to burning the billboards. Mildred instructs Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves.
Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was overseas on military duty at the time of the murder. Mildred and Dixon conclude that the man must be guilty of some other sexual assault, and set out for Idaho with a gun. On the way, Mildred confesses to him the police station fire; he replies without surprise. They express reservations about their mission, but agree to decide what to do on the way."

Intent on recovering an invaluable microfilm containing the list of names of every British spy, Lorraine must do battle with endless waves of hard-as-nails KGB agents and unrelenting henchmen, in the bowels of a city at boiling point. Under those circumstances, as both sides want the list desperately, whom can Lorraine trust?—Nick Riganas In November 1989, just days prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, MI6 agent James Gascoigne is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin, who steals The List, a microfilm document concealed in Gascoigne's wristwatch that contains the names of every intelligence agent (on both sides) active in Berlin. Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debrief room and flashbacks to Lorraine's time in Berlin.. London, November 1989. Beautiful and lethal, MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton is being interrogated by her superior Eric Gray, and against her objections CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld, it a debrief concerning a just concluded mission in Berlin ""gone wrong"" in certain respects in what ended up being the approach to the fall of the wall. Murdered MI6 agent James Gascoine was supposed to have a comprehensive list of secret agents on both sides given to him by a Stasi agent named Spyglass, that list getting in the wrong hands i.e. the KGB which would tip the balance of the Cold War. In Gascoine's death, the list had gone missing, Broughton dispatched to Berlin undercover to recover the list from who they believe currently has it, a KGB agent named Yuri Bakhtin, she to work with MI6's Berlin section chief David Percival, who has immersed himself in the bohemian Berlin lifestyle both as a cover but also as a personal choice. Broughton felt that there was someone tipping off the KGB as she believed her cover was blown as soon as she arrived in Berlin, which leads to the reason for her objection of Kurzfeld being in the meeting in she not wanting to divulge information that he should perhaps not know: that she had a secondary mission in Berlin, namely to discover the identity of a mole who had long been giving MI6 problems, that agent going by the code name Satchel. She didn't know if Satchel was the source of the leak of her identity to the KGB and/or the young, mysterious woman she noticed following her ever since her arrival in town. With regard to the list, she learned that Spyglass himself could be as important an asset to the West as the list, he wanting to defect however with conditions.—Huggo In 1989, before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, MI6 agent James Gasciogne (Sam Hargrave) is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin, who steals the List, a piece of microfilm concealed in a wristwatch that contains the names of every active field agent in the Soviet Union. The list was provided to Gasciogne by a informant code-name Spyglass, who was promised immunity by the MI6. The list can extend the cold war for another 40 years, so all governments are after it and Yuri is still in Berlin.
Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), a top-level spy for MI6, is brought in to be interrogated by MI6 executive Eric Gray (Toby Jones) and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) about her mission to Berlin. The rest of the movie is in flashback.The day after Gasciogne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to Berlin to recover the List and assassinate Satchel, a double agent who has sold intelligence to the Soviets for years and who betrayed Gascoigne. The list is supposed to contain the identity of Satchel, which is why MI6 is interested in it.
Meanwhile Spyglass has contacted David Percival MI6 top man in Berlin to inform him that he has delivered the list to Gasciogne. Percival refuses to take Spyglass since Gasciogne didn't show up and he still doesn't have the list. Spyglass says that he has it memorized.
When she arrives in Berlin, she is immediately ambushed by KGB agents working for arms dealer and KGB associate Aleksander Bremovych (Roland Møller), but is able to escape thanks to her main contact, agent David Percival (James McAvoy), showing up to help. Percival says that he has never met Spyglass. Bremovych is also looking for Bkahtin for the list and knows Bakhtin is trying hard to sell it.
After failing to find any immediate leads, Lorraine searches Gascoigne's apartment and discovers a picture of him and Percival, and is then ambushed by the West German police. She realizes only Percival knew she was going to the apartment, and begins to suspect him of being Satchel. Lorraine also encounters Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella), a naive French agent, and enters into a relationship with her. Lasalle has been tracking Lorraine since she landed in Berlin.Bakhtin declares his intention to sell the List to the highest bidder. Percival, having been tipped off, kills him and takes the List for himself. He then meets with Bremovych, which Lasalle photographs.
Percival meets Lorraine & now informs her that Spyglass has memorized the list and wants to defect. Lorraine is upset that Percival did not reveal this before, else she would have prioritized the extraction of Spyglass. The same night Percival called Eric and told him that he had the list and knew the identity of Satchel. This was not known to Lorraine.
Percival offers to escort the defector who stole and memorized the List, a Stasi officer code-named Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), and his family across the border to West Berlin. Lorraine offers to help & makes her own arrangements. Percival has shooters on top to take out Spyglass, but Lorraine hides herself and Spyglass behind umbrellas to thwart the shooters. However, Pervical shoots Spyglass and tips off Bremovych's men, and despite Lorraine's best efforts, Spyglass is killed. At this point, it is very clear to Lorraine that Pervical has betrayed her and Spyglass.
It turns out that Lasalle was following Lorraine on Percival's instructions. But now Lasalle knows that Percival has met Bremovych & threatens him. Percival warns her that she doesn't know who she is dealing with (referring to Lorraine).
Percival then goes to Lasalle's apartment and kills her to cover his own tracks. When Lorraine arrives too late to save her, she discovers the photographs taken by Lasalle proving Percival to be Satchel. As Percival burns his safe-house and attempts to flee, Lorraine tracks him down, kills him, and takes the List. Lorraine reveals that he had met Bremovych as the real target that day was not Spyglass, but Lorraine. Percival wanted the KGB to eliminate Lorraine. He knew that Spyglass was a liability to everyone and thus had to eliminated as well and that Lorraine was the real Satchel.Returning to the MI6 debriefing, Lorraine presents photographs as well as spliced audio recordings painting Percival as a traitor, and denies knowing the List's current whereabouts, forcing the agency to close the case. Three days later, she meets with Bremovych in Paris, revealing herself to be Satchel. Lorraine gives him a fake List, but Bremovych admits he knows she set him up. Lorraine kills his henchmen, and before killing him reveals she was manipulating events from the very beginning.
Later in Paris she meets with Kurzfeld, revealing herself to be an American triple agent planted by the CIA, before returning with him to Langley."

Barry takes his plane for a ride and almost crashes into the trees but manages to pull up and continue his flight with ease and get back to the U.S. without getting in trouble.Barry now has the trust of the cartel. However, the DEA raid one of their compounds, and Barry is arrested. Schafer finds him in his cell and tells him that his house will get raided, and Lucy will most likely be brought in for questioning and be kept overnight. When Barry gets out, he goes home and urges Lucy and the kids to pack up their things so they can move. Despite Lucy's questioning, Barry insists he cannot tell her a thing, leading her to lose trust in him.The Seals move to Mena, AR. Barry is then given the assignment to move guns for the Contras, even being allowed to own his own airport and planes for the job. His first flight to meet with the Contras ends with them robbing his stuff instead of taking his guns. Barry calls Schafer to let him know that the Contras aren't interested in the guns. On his second trip, he meets with a cartel leader to negotiate sending the guns to the cartel instead. Barry brings guns to the cartel and ships their drugs to the U.S. and the Contras while trying his hardest to avoid being detected by the law.Barry gets four other men to help him on his trips when he realizes the workload is too much for one guy to pull off. They fly separate planes on their missions.Schafer then asks Barry to bring back some of the Contras to the U.S. for the CIA's newly-established training base. Upon arrival, however, some of the men run away.As Barry's business grows, he starts to contribute to the community and provide even more for his family while also shamelessly indulging in his wealth and setting up fronts to hide all the money. Eventually, the Seals are visited by Lucy's freeloading brother JB (Caleb Landry Jones), whom Barry is not fond of. When Lucy tells JB to get a job, Barry sets him up working at the airport. JB ends up taking some money that Barry was hiding in the hangar, using it to buy himself a new car and to pick up an underage girl.The DEA starts to go after the pilots. On one mission, Barry crash-lands and loses a significant portion of the drugs. Meanwhile, the cartel runs into trouble when Escobar declares war on the government, and the cartel gets kicked out of Colombia. Barry must meet with them to sort out the issues. At the same time, JB gets arrested by the sheriff after he is caught carrying a suitcase full of money.After bailing JB out, Barry drives him to a separate car so that he can leave and never return. JB curses Barry and drives away, only to be blown up by a car bomb. Barry gets rid of the car by dumping it in the woods.Barry and Schafer meet to discuss what's been going on. Schafer says the Contras left since they just weren't fighting. The CIA then starts to get rid of anything involving Barry. Barry attempts to move the stash of products out of the airport, but he is found by FBI, DEA, and other law enforcement agents, and he is arrested.Barry meets with a prosecutor, Dana Sibota (Jayma Mays), who is hellbent on getting Barry locked up. As he waits outside while she speaks to a lawyer on the phone, Barry tries to bribe the agents with caddies while also insisting he will walk away scot-free. Sibota comes out and confirms that Barry is free to go.Barry is given a task under Ronald Reagan's administration to gather dirt on the Sandinistas, all of whom are believed to be drug traffickers. They set up cameras in a plane for Barry to get photos as proof.Barry returns to meet with Ochoa and the rest of the Medellin Cartel. As he still has their trust, Barry engages in business with them, moving products into the plane where the photos are taken. The White House later releases the photos as propaganda, and Barry is seen in the photos. He is told that they were not supposed to be released to the public until after the cartel members were caught. The DEA go through Barry's house looking for evidence. Lucy takes the kids to Baton Rouge.Barry is convicted and is sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service. He moves from hotel to hotel each night. On one such night, he is approached in his car by hit-men sent by Escobar, and he is subsequently murdered.The final text states that ""Schafer"" got promoted after suggesting they get the Iranians to arm the Contras. One of Barry's guys went on to become a pastor in Alabama after he was set free. The rest of the pilots weren't seen after that. The CIA continued to use Barry's plane to arm the Contras until one of the planes was shot down over Nicaragua. The ensuing scandal was known as the Iran-Contra Affair. Lucy returned to Louisiana with the kids. The last thing we see is her working as a cashier at a coffee shop, still wearing a bracelet that Barry gave her."

Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is a high-school senior from the ""wrong side of the tracks"". She longs for adventure, sophistication, and opportunity, but finds little of that in her Sacramento Catholic high school. Her senior year improves: she finds her first romance, participates in the school play, and--most importantly--applies for college.—Dehlia Christine McPherson's (Saoirse Ronan's) senior year of high school in 2002/03 is presented. The younger of Larry and Marion McPherson's (Tracy Letts, Laurie Metcalf) two children, Christine outwardly hates most of the aspects of her life: She hates that they have long endured an existence of barely scraping by, and their situation is even worse now in the poor economy that has led to Larry being laid off and Marion needing to work double shifts as a counselor at a psychiatric hospital just to keep their heads above water, and Christine's big brother Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues) and his girlfriend Shelly Yuhan (Marielle Scott) moving back into the McPhersons' small, already-overcrowded house with one bathroom now for five people. She hates that what her parents have decided to spend on her within their already tight budget is an expensive Catholic private-school education at Immaculate Heart, solely because Miguel witnessed long ago some violence outside Sacramento High School, where she would have gone otherwise. At Immaculate Heart, her only friend is the equally-poor Julie Steffans (Beanie Feldstein). Lady Bird hates living in Sacramento and is determined to attend an Eastern liberal-arts college, preferably one in New York City, using financial aid, rather than attending a California college like nearby UC Davis, for which she would be eligible for an in-state tuition reduction. Getting into any college is questionable because she puts little effort into her schoolwork despite being bright, except perhaps in math. But what she hates the most is her strained relationship with her mother Marion, who is always bad cop to Larry's good cop. Marion and Christine's strained relationship is exacerbated by both being strong-willed people. Christine believes that her mother might love her because she has to, but doesn't actually like her. Christine has decided to rename herself ""Lady Bird"", something she wants everyone to call her from now on.

Emily suddenly passes out.Emily wakes up in a small village that Linda brought her to. She is being treated by Dr. Armando (Arturo Castro). He tells Emily that her constant hunger and subsequent passing out is the result of a tapeworm in her body.

Emily freaks out and runs out, but the worm is pulled out.Emily starts to interact with the local women and helps them in their chores.

From an early age, Tupac, instilled with black pride, witnesses multiple injustices in his neighborhood. His stepfather, Mutulu, a revolutionary, is caught by the FBI for an armored-truck robbery and murder. As Tupac gets older, he distances himself from his mother's revolutionary ideals. He attends the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he becomes friends with Jada Pinkett. Tupac's music career begins when he joins Digital Underground for their hit ""Same Song"". Under manager Leila Steinberg, he begins to have hip-hop albums produced. Although his music becomes popular, some songs' controversial lyrics cause tensions between him and his record producers.. The film opens at the Clinton Correctional Facility in 1995. A documentary filmmaker (Hill Harper) shows up with his crew and equipment to sit down with Tupac Amaru Shakur (Demetrius Shipp, Jr.). The filmmaker wants to get the real story from the man himself.In 1971 New York City, Tupac's mother Afeni (Danai Gurira) is released from prison along with her fellow Black Panthers following her acquittal of several charges. She is pregnant with Tupac and she voices her complaints to a reporter over the unfair treatment of black individuals in the country from not only society, but the system sworn to protect its citizens.From an early age, Tupac is taught about black pride and is witness to multiple injustices in his East Harlem neighborhood involving racism and police brutally against African Americans. His stepfather Mutulu (Jamie Hector) is an Afrocentric Black revolutionary who has influenced Afeni, who in turn influences her son and Tupac's sister. Mutulu is wanted by the FBI for a robbery of an armored truck and the murder of two police officers and a guard. FBI agents follow Afeni and her children, despite her telling them to back off. Mutulu is eventually caught during a raid when cops burst into the Shakurs' apartment, with cops violently pinning Tupac and his sister to the ground.As Tupac gets older into his teens, he distances himself more and more from his mother's ideals and behavior. He eventually moves out on his own, along with his sister. At one point, Tupac catches Afeni outside his apartment purchasing drugs from a dealer. He punches the dealer and pulls his mother away, scolding her for being an addict. He later takes her to seek treatment, assuring her that she is strong enough to overcome her addiction.During his teen years, Tupac attends the Baltimore School for the Arts where he becomes close friends with Jada Pinkett (Kat Graham). She promises that they will always be friends. Tupac reads her a poem that he wrote for her and about her.Tupac's music career starts when he joins the Digital Underground record company for their hit ""Same Song"". Under his manager Leila Steinberg (Lauren Cohan), he begins to have hip-hop albums produced. Although his music is popular, he gets into hot water with record producers for songs like ""Brenda's Got a Baby"", which is about a young girl who is raped by her cousin, has a baby on the bathroom floor, turns to prostitution and selling drugs for money, and how she is ultimately murdered on the streets. Tupac argues that the song comes from real stories in the streets of the impoverished and how nobody is willing to help people like the subject of the song. He also points out that the song sounds good, and the producers agree on that. He is also criticized of misogynistic lyrics toward women, which some speculate is attributed to his feelings toward his mother. In response, Tupac releases ""Keep Ya Head Up"" as a tribute to black women.In 1991, Tupac also starts an acting career by appearing in movies such as ""Juice"", as well as collaborating with other rap artists like Biggie Smalls (Jamal Woolard), both performing to excited crowds at venues. He generates as much praise as he does controversy in what he does outside of music, such as donating money to poor black citizens. He is seen giving money to two women and a little girl.Outside of his performances, Tupac has frequent run-ins with the police when he is caught jaywalking and is beaten by two racist officers. On another occasion, he and one of his friends catch two white men assaulting a black man. When they try to intervene, one man pulls a gun on Tupac and tells him to get lost. He goes back to his limo and gets his own gun. It turns out the two men were off-duty cops, and Tupac is arrested for shooting at them.Another incident occurs when Tupac is performing at a music festival in 1992. Tupac and his guys are confronted by other guys looking to start talking trash. Tupac tells them off, but one of the guys tries attacking him. Tupac fights him off, and a brawl ensues. Someone fires their gun. In the ensuing chaos, a 6-year-old boy is shot and he dies in his mother's arms.Tupac becomes involved with a drug dealer named Nigel (Cory Hardrict), and they do business together in music. When things go sour, Tupac and Nigel have a falling out. Nigel's guys want to retaliate against Tupac, but Nigel says that nobody touches Tupac unless he says so. The other guys appear to go against Nigel's orders.In 1993, Tupac meets a young woman named Briana (Erica Pinkett). She seduces him in the club and gives him a blowjob among the crowd. They have sex, but Briana starts stalking and harassing Tupac with multiple phone calls. She is with Tupac and other men in a hotel room one night. Tupac receives a massage from her and he later falls asleep. Briana barges into his room hours later crying and screaming, indicating that the other men raped her. Tupac is later on trial for rape and harassment charges.On November 30, 1994, Tupac is attacked by three black men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios. Tupac is shot five times before the men flee. Biggie and other guys in Tupac's entourage rush to him before he is taken to the hospital. When Biggie tries to visit Tupac, he is turned away for not being a family member. Tupac checks himself out of the hospital early against doctors' orders.The following day, Tupac's sentence is declared in his trial. He is found not guilty of rape, but is found guilty of illegal touching, and is thus sentenced to 18 months in prison. Tupac calls out the judge for not looking him once in the eye since the whole trial began, stating that the judge doesn't care about justice, and that Tupac's life is in God's hands. This is where the documentary filmmaker's work ends.While in prison, Tupac hears Biggie's song ""Who Shot Ya?"" and interprets it as a ""diss track"" bragging about Biggie's alleged involvement in his shooting. Tupac encounters Mutulu in there, who encourages him to work after he gets out. Mutulu later murders another inmate by stabbing him to death. Tupac is also assaulted by two guards while in prison.Following his release from prison after serving eight months of his 18 month sentence, Tupac signs a contract to Death Row Records under Suge Knight (Dominic L. Santana), and he collaborates with artists like Dr. Dre (Harold House Moore) and Snoop Dogg (Jarrett Ellis). Tupac and Dre work on the hit song ""California Love"". He releases the track ""Hit Em Up"" as a response to ""Who Shot Ya?"" in which Tupac brags about supposedly having an affair with Biggie's wife Faith Evans (Grace Gibson). This causes a rift between him and Jada when she confronts him about the song, but Tupac is rude to her and she turns her back on him.While working with Suge, Tupac is witness to much of Suge's brutalities. During a dinner party, Suge calls out a member of his group for stealing money from him. He force-feeds him the food off his plate and has his other guys beat the man up.Tupac meets Kidada Jones (Annie Ilonzeh), daughter of record producer Quincy Jones. She is angry at Tupac for comments he made about her father for going around having relationships with white women. Tupac defends his comments by saying that successful black men tend to go after white women instead of other black women, but he meant no disrespect by it. He tries to sweet-talk Kidada but she has none of it. Eventually, Kidada warms up to him and they start a relationship, which evolves into an engagement. Kidada meets Afeni, and Afeni tells Tupac she approves of Kidada.In Tupac's final months, he decides to split from Death Row Records to start his own company to produce more music, movies, and TV shows. Suge reminds Tupac that he is still in debt from other business dealings. Later, however, Suge offers Tupac a chance to become partners, with Suge taking over the west coast part of Death Row, and Tupac taking over the east coast. Tupac agrees to it.On September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Tupac, Suge, and the rest of their guys are leaving the Mike Tyson/Bruce Seldon boxing fight at the MGM Grand. One of the Death Row guys alerts Tupac and Suge to a gang member that jumped him and stole his chain. Tupac and company confront the gang member, and Tupac punches him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Suge and his guys start assaulting the man as Tupac is pulled off of him.Tupac stops by his hotel to change his clothes. He tells Kidada about the situation. She tries to go with him but Tupac assures her he will only be gone for an hour.Tupac and Suge drive from the hotel with the rest of his guys following them. On the road, they are chatted up by two women pulling up next to them at a red light. On Tupac's side, another car pulls up with several unseen gang members inside. Tupac takes a look and a gun sticks out. Tupac is shot multiple times before the car flees the scene. Suge rushes Tupac away from there and drives about a mile before his tires blow out. Police officers on bikes try to stop Suge until the other guys show up and one of them shows the officers his badge. Suge desperately tries to save Tupac as others gather around him, but Tupac starts to lose consciousness.The ending text states that Tupac died six days later at a local hospital from his gunshot wounds. To this day, his murder remains unsolved. By the time of his death at age of 25, he released 15 albums, seven posthumous albums, sang and recorded 713 songs, and acted in seven movies.The film concludes with a clip of the real Tupac Shakur talking about people knowing the real him."

Xander learns that Xiang and his team are xXx agents with their own agenda. Moments later, a team of Russian soldiers storms the place. Xander and Xiang's teams spring into action. Adele shoots the goons and then follows the others as Xiang and his team get away.Later on, Xander chases after Xiang on motorcycles that are equipped to surf on water. They ride through the waves as Xander tries to take Pandora's Box. He succeeds, but when he gets back to shore, Serena shoots and destroys it, then decides to join the xXx team.Marke informs the team that Pandora's Box was used to destroy a Russian stadium. The one Xander took was just a prototype. The team realizes that someone in the CIA was in on the plot to help Xiang. They review footage of when Xiang broke into the headquarters, and Xander sees that Director Anderson (Al Sapienza) was the only person not to flinch when Xiang arrived.The team tracks down Xiang and his team. Xander chases Xiang on the streets while Tennyson brings Adele, Nicks, and Serena to chase after Hawk, which leads to them crashing vans (which sets Tennyson's record to 200 crashes). Xander and Xiang fight one-on-one before Xander continues chasing Xiang to a warehouse. They end up helping each other avoid the gunmen before they reach Anderson. Adele is in a building across the street trying to get a shot on Anderson, but can't see with the thermal reading because the heat is cranked up. Anderson admits he crashed the satellite that killed Gibbons. Xander stands by the window and tells Adele to ""read between the lines"". He holds up his fingers and makes an opening for Adele to shoot Anderson in the head.Marke and her men recover Pandora's Box and they apprehend Xiang. As they are leaving on the jet, Marke gets a phone call and says to Xander that the xXx program has been shuttered, so the agents must be eliminated. She reveals her true intentions and shoots Xander three times. She then sends for an extraction team to get Xander and Xiang's teammates, but they quickly discover the team are a bunch of hitmen sent to kill them. Both teams join forces to fight back. Adele and Serena shoot at the villains, and even Becky gets in on the shooting (albeit a bit clumsy). They are then joined by Darius Stone (Ice Cube), the last xXx agent recruited by Gibbons back in 2005. He comes in with a grenade launcher and blows up the villains.On the plane, Xander recovers thanks to some armor. He and Xiang team up to fight Donovan and his goons. Donovan breaks out the bionic gloves and starts punching all the equipment on the plane as Xander dodges the punches. They fight in the bathroom, and Donovan punches the toilet, causing him to burst a hole in the plane that Xander pushes him out of. Marke uses Pandora's Box to send a satellite to the safe house to kill the teams. She shoots Xiang but he notices her foot is stuck on a strap. He pulls a parachute open and sends Marke falling out of the plane. Xiang falls out with his own chute. Serena calls Xander to inform him that the satellite is headed their way. Xander flies the plane in the direction of the satellite kamikaze-style. He runs and jumps out of the plane before it collides with the satellite. He lands safely using a cargo load. Once at the bottom, he stomps on Pandora's Box, destroying it for good. Xander and Serena kiss, and then Darius pulls up in Xander's old car. The two xXX men meet for the first time.The now larger team attends Gibbons' funeral. Xander is up at the top when he is visited by none other than Gibbons himself. He faked his death once again and is keeping a low profile. Gibbons is also glad that Xander is back in action. He tells Xander all he has to do is ""kick some ass, get the girl, and try to look dope"". Gibbons leaves with Neymar while Xander continues to watch the service."

As they submerge 47m they encounter a creature that only wants flesh and blood. As they fight their way back to the top, they shortly run out of oxygen. With only an hour left they're not only racing against time they are racing against life and death.—anthonybobb Two sisters vacationing in Mexico venture into the deep blue sea inside a cage to experience viewing sharks a few meters down when one sister starts panicking from a couple of Sharks getting too close to the Cage, they're pulled up as the cable snaps dropping the Cage to the Bottom of the Ocean floor and the girls have less than an hour of Air remaining in their tanks. They lost communication with the men in the boat as they race against time to get saved while at the same time sharks are closing-in for the prey. Survival skills kick-in to prevent from becoming the sharks next meal. Planning to spend a cheerful vacation in Mexico with her boyfriend, instead, Lisa invites her adventurous younger sister, Kate, to have the time of their lives. Soon, the two sisters will meet a couple of friendly locals, who in the spur of the moment, convince the girls to join them on a shark-diving excursion to get a close-up look of the magnificent 25-foot great white sharks in the safety of an enclosed cage. Hesitantly, Lisa agrees; however, things will take an unexpected turn, when, due to sudden mechanical failure, the heavy cage plummets forty-seven meters down to the ocean's seabed, in shark-infested waters. Now, the only place safe is inside the confined space of the rickety cage; nevertheless, how long will it take the monstrous oceanic predators to break it?—Nick Riganas No way out. No way up. No chance in hell. Two sisters on Mexican vacation are trapped in a shark observation cage at the bottom of the ocean, with oxygen running low and great whites circling nearby, they have less than an hour of air left to figure out how to get to the surface.—purstris Lisa (Mandy Moore) and Kate (Claire Holt) are two sisters vacationing in Mexico. Lisa has just broken up with her boyfriend, but is keeping this a secret from Kate. One night, Kate wakes up and finds Lisa crying. Lisa tells Kate that her boyfriend left her because he got bored. Lisa tells Kate that he left because she's not fun enough and the reason she's on the trip is to regain that sense of fun that she used to have. Kate drags Lisa to a party where they meet two men, Louis and Benjamin.After the party, Louis and Benjamin walk Lisa and Kate back to their room. Kate kisses Louis, but when Benjamin leans in to kiss Lisa, she backs away, telling him that she's not ready. As Benjamin leaves, Lisa tells him to wait as she runs up to kiss him, trying to embrace her fun side. Before they leave, Louis and Benjamin tell the two sisters about shark diving, which they do with their friend, Taylor (Matthew Modine). Kate urges Lisa to join her in trying it out. Lisa is hesitant at first but eventually gives in at the behest of Kate.The next morning, the two sisters meet up with Louis and Benjamin who take the two to meet Taylor. Taylor is the captain of an old boat, which houses a rusty shark cage. Taylor asks the two sisters if they've ever been scuba diving before, which both claim they have. Louis and Benjamin are the first two to get into the shark cage. They get in and are lowered into the water. Lisa and Kate go into another room and get fitted into scuba gear.Before they go into the cage, Taylor informs them of the equipment, which includes a meter that tells the user how much oxygen they have left. After Louis and Benjamin take their turn in the cage, Kate and Lisa get into it. They are lowered into the water. They don't see any sharks, so Taylor has his first mate, Javier, throw some fish blood into the water to attract the sharks.It eventually does. However, the line holding the cage breaks, sending Lisa and Kate straight down the ocean, inside the cage. They eventually hit what appears to be the ocean floor, 47 meters (around 154 feet) down from the top of the ocean. Lisa is freaking out, and Kate has to calm her down. They are too far down for them to hear Taylor on their radio. So, Kate ends up having to leave the safety of the cage to swim to where she can get in touch with Taylor on the radio. She eventually reaches Taylor who tells Kate that he is going to send Javier down with a cable to bring the cage back to the surface. But, he warns Kate to stay in the cage because of the sharks.Kate goes back to the cage and tells Lisa what Taylor told her. After some time has passed, they see a flashlight in the distance, which they deduce is Javier. Since Kate is running low on oxygen, Lisa decides to go and bring Javier to the cage. Lisa swims out to meet Javier but is suddenly ambushed by a Great White shark. She is able to hide inside a small cavern of rocks, but the shark still tries to get her. The shark eventually leaves, and Lisa continues swimming towards the flashlight. She reaches a drop-off point, where the ocean continues heading down. But, she continues heading out to the flashlight, even though she cannot see anything below her. She eventually reaches the flashlight but does not see Javier. Javier appears out of nowhere, but suddenly he is attacked by the shark and killed.Lisa swims away, but finds part of Javier's body and finds that he is carrying the cable that was going to be attached to the cage. Lisa takes the cable back and attaches it to the top of the cage. She swims up and tells Taylor that she has attached the cable to the cage and that Javier was killed. He tells her to get back to the cage.Lisa swims back to the cage and Taylor begins raising them to the surface. They get about 20 meters from the surface when the steel cable frays and then snaps, sending the cage back to the ocean floor. When the cage lands, it pins Lisa's leg, trapping her. Noticing that she's running low on air in her tank, Kate swims back up to let Taylor know. He tells her that he is going to send another oxygen tank down to them. He also warns Kate that their risk of experiencing nitrogen narcosis will be much higher once they use the second tank of oxygen and that they should watch each other closely for hallucinations.Kate sees the tank coming down and goes out to get it. A bag is attached to the tank with some flares. Kate gets the tank and is coming back to the cage when she spots a shark. She hides by some rocks and waits for it to leave. It swims by her, but due to how dark it is in the water, Kate and Lisa lose sight of it. Assuming it's gone, Kate decides to make a break for the cage. As soon as she does, the shark appears, attacking her. She drops the tank, which lands near the cage.Lisa grieves for her sister. A little while later, her oxygen monitor starts beeping, signaling she's running out of air. She sees the tank near the cage, but since her leg is pinned down, she cannot reach it. She sees a spear gun, which was also attached to the tank. She reaches out for it, but the trigger rubs against a part of the cage and accidentally shoots Lisa in the hand, drawing blood. Lisa screams in pain and begins looking at her wound.She uses the spear gun to reach the oxygen tank. She eventually is able to get it and changes oxygen tanks, giving her more air. She begins hearing a voice on the radio and discovers it's Kate, she's still alive. Lisa decides to use her scuba gear to lift the cage, getting her free. She swims out of the cage and finds Kate, with a very bloody wound on her leg. They talk to Taylor and tell him that they are going to try to swim to the top. He tells them to go for it, but not to go too fast or else they will die, due to oxygen bubbles going straight to their brain. They use the flares to ward off the sharks, which works. As they get halfway, they have to stop to decompress for five minutes. As the flare burns out, Kate grabs another one but drops it. Lisa grabs the last flare, and as she lights it, four or five sharks are circling them. They continue to fend the sharks off with the flare. When they get to the top, they swim to the boat. Taylor, Louis, and Benjamin begin to help them back into the boat. Suddenly, Lisa is grabbed by a shark. She starts picking at its eye with her fingers, which works and it lets her go. Lisa and Kate are helped back into the boat.Lisa begins looking at the wound on her hand and notices that the blood from it is blowing off into the wind, instead of flowing down her arm. She begins to hear Taylor's voice, and it is revealed that Lisa has been hallucinating everything since she began breathing from the new oxygen. She is still pinned against the cage. Still hallucinating that she's talking to Kate on Taylor's boat, she says that they are finally free as she begins laughing hysterically. On the radio, Taylor tells her that she is hallucinating, but that the coast guard is there and they are coming down to help her. Lisa sees the coast guard coming down to help free her and keeps saying Kate's name as she searches their faces. As they help her out of the cage, she begins to come back to her senses. Tears roll down her eyes as she and the coast guard make their way back to the surface safely."

After five months, Emily finds photos of the women Kumail's parents have set him up with; they argue and she asks whether he sees a real future with her, given his family's expectations. The film opens with a stand-up comedy bit from Kumail Nanjiani (Kumail Nanjiani) talking about how life growing up in Pakistan is not much different from life in America, other than arranged marriages, playing cricket instead of baseball, and the fact that they get old TV shows like ""Knight Rider"" around this time.Between stand-up gigs, Kumail is an Uber driver in Chicago. He frequently performs with his fellow comics CJ (Bo Burnham), Mary (Andy Bryant), and Chris (Kurt Braunohler). At their comedy club spot, they spot a recruiter named Bob Dalavan (Jeremy Shamos), who is looking for comedians to headline his upcoming Montreal Showcase.

Sharmeen frequently sets Kumail up with other Pakistani women in really unsubtle ways to get him to marry one of them. He keeps all of their pictures in a cigar box despite having absolutely no interest in any of these women.Kumail continues to see Emily without his family knowing. She attends his one-man show with her friend Jesse (Rebecca Naomi Jones), which is essentially a lecture of Pakistan's history and culture.

Kumail calls her almost immediately and she invites him upstairs.Kumail goes out with Naveed to the batting cages. During lunch, Kumail tells Naveed that he is dating a white woman.

Emily is angry and hurt by Kumail's lies and she storms out of his apartment.Kumail performs again later that night and takes home another woman after writing her name in Urdu. He gets a phone call from Jesse, urging Kumail to go to the hospital because Emily has been admitted due to a sickness.Kumail shows up to the hospital and finds Emily, who is not happy to see him. The doctor pulls Kumail out to tell him that Emily has an infection in her lungs and that they need to put her in a medically-induced coma. Despite not being her husband, Kumail signs off on the coma for Emily's sake. He then uses Emily's thumb to unlock her phone so he can call her parents and tell them what has happened.Emily's parents, Beth (Holly Hunter) and Terry (Ray Romano), arrive at the hospital in the morning after Kumail has spent the night there. Beth knows about Kumail from what Emily has told them, and she is not happy to see him. Terry is slightly more accepting of Kumail calling them and making sure Emily is taken care of. Although Kumail attempts to hang around with Emily's parents, Beth is not willing to let him get close, claiming he screwed up with Emily.The doctors tell Kumail, Beth, and Terry that they will need to keep Emily in the coma until they remove the infection from her lungs. Terry invites Kumail to sit with him and Beth as they have lunch in the hospital cafeteria. Terry makes it awkward by trying to talk to Kumail about 9/11.Beth and Terry stay at Emily's apartment until they hear updates on their daughter's condition. Kumail tries to get out of spending time with them by saying he is going to be headlining a comedy show that night. Terry decides to go to take his mind off Emily's condition, and he invites a reluctant Beth. Kumail performs the show, and he sees that Beth and Terry are laughing and enjoying it. A heckler then tells Kumail to go back to ISIS. After an awkward silence, Beth calls out the heckler and nearly fights with him until she is pulled out of the club.Back at Emily's apartment, Terry is sleeping while Beth shows Kumail embarrassing pictures of Emily in high school when she was a goth. Beth then mentions details about her and Terry's relationship.At Kumail's family's house, Sharmeen introduces Kumail to a young woman named Khadija (Vella Lovell). She entertains the family with a trick where she draws sunglasses on Andrew Jackson's head on a $20 bill, then having the shades slide down his face. After spending a night with Khadija and her parents, Kumail takes her home. Khadija asks Kumail if he wants to hang out, but he lets her down gently and says they wouldn't work together because he loves someone else. Khadija is hurt and she goes back into her house before insulting ""The X-Files"", which is Kumail's favorite show.Kumail, Beth, and Terry learn from the doctors that they need to keep Emily in the coma longer than expected. Beth becomes worried and considers moving Emily to a different hospital. Kumail speaks to a nurse about this, and she says that would not be good for Emily at this stage. Beth and Terry get into a fight because Beth thinks Terry is too scared to come to a decision.Terry stays at Kumail's apartment for the night. He admits to Kumail that he once had a one-night stand behind Beth's back, but he felt so guilty that he ended up telling her what he did. Terry says that's how he knew he really loved Beth, since he felt like shit after what he did.In the morning, Kumail finds a note from Terry saying he is going to the hospital. When Kumail gets there, he finds Beth and Terry preparing to sign off on moving Emily to another hospital. Despite Kumail pleading and objecting, the two insist they are doing what's best for their daughter.Kumail's parents show up at his apartment to demand to know what is going on with him in regards to him rejecting Khadija. Kumail becomes frustrated and admits to them that he is in love with a white woman; Emily. Predictably, Sharmeen explicitly disowns Kumail, and Azmat tells Kumail he is being selfish for trying to look out for himself and not consider the feelings of those around him.Kumail goes to a fast food restaurant asking specifically for four slices of cheese on one burger. When he's told that they can't do that, Kumail flips out and screams obscenities at the guy behind the window before throwing a garbage bin around. He then apologizes and just gets his food. As he eats, he gets a text reminding him that he is going up for the Montreal Showcase in less than 20 minutes.Kumail arrives at the comedy club for the show, clearly not ready to perform. He goes up onstage and starts to tell jokes, but he quickly breaks down and talks about Emily being in a coma, unable to hold back tears or keep his act together. Afterwards, he visits Emily at the hospital and gently tells her it's okay if she wants to let go now.The next day, Kumail gets a text from Terry telling him to go to the hospital. When Kumail gets there, he finds that Emily is awake, sitting with Beth and Terry. The three are told by a doctor that Emily's disease causes her body to think she's sick and is fighting against an otherwise harmless ailment. When they leave the room, Kumail goes to talk to Emily, but she is still mad at him for what happened before she went comatose. She says Kumail makes her feel sad and she doesn't want to see him. Kumail dejectedly leaves. He passes Beth and says it's crazy that they went through something together and that they probably won't see each other again. Beth says maybe it doesn't have to be like that.Beth and Terry host a welcome-home party for Emily. Kumail shows up with a gift and talks to Emily in private. He claims that he's changed and wants her to take him back. Emily argues that he only came to this realization when she was sick and that she doesn't think it's fair for either of them to pursue something they don't feel mutually.Kumail returns to the comedy club after his disastrous performance. CJ and Mary tell Kumail they are moving to New York City and they want him to join them so they can continue doing comedy over there.Kumail goes to his parents' house. Everyone, including Naveed and Fatima, is giving him the silent treatment. Kumail has prepared cards to anticipate their responses to try and break the tension. He insists that he will not be kicked out of the family because he is technically part of the family and the decision should be unanimous. The family continues to stay silent.Life continues to go on for everyone. Kumail continues to perform stand-up and his one man show. Emily goes through physical therapy. Beth and Terry are able to sleep in the same bed together again. Emily watches a video of Kumail bombing as he talks about her, knowing what he said about her was sincere. Beth talks to Emily about how Kumail was there for her the whole time.Kumail is getting ready to move with CJ and Mary. A car pulls up across the street. Azmat comes up to Kumail with a container filled with Kumail's favorite home-cooked meal. Sharmeen still refuses to talk to or even look at Kumail. Azmat still insists that Kumail is kicked out, but he wishes his son good luck as he moves.Kumail is now performing in an NYC comedy club. In the middle of his bit, he hears a ""woo-hoo!"" It's Emily with some friends. They have the same exchange they had about heckling when they first met, and Kumail asks what brings her to New York. Emily says she is there to see someone. The two then share a hopeful and loving smile.The closing credits feature pictures of the real Kumail Nanjiani with his wife Emily V. Gordon (whom Movie-Emily is based off of), and their traditional Pakistani wedding with Kumail's brother and parents standing next to them."

They succeed and back to Alpha, unknown humanoids abduct Commander Arun Filitt (Clive Owen) expecting to steal the converter. They head to a forbidden area that is infected, but Valerian and Laureline follow them and disclose a hidden secret about the race and the infected area.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the twenty-eighth century, due to cooperation between the Earth's countries (beginning with the ASTP of 1975) and extra-terrestrial peoples, the former International Space Station has been added to until its mass threatens to cause it to fall out of orbit. Relocated to deep space using a set of trustees, it becomes Alpha, a space-travelling city inhabited by millions of species from thousands of planets. A special Police division is created by the ""United Human Federation"" (a world government formed by a federation of Earth's countries) to preserve peace through the galaxy, including happy-go-lucky Major Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and his partner, no-nonsense Sergeant Laureline (Cara Delevingne).

They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy, and use small animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, and as the humanoids investigate the derelicts, one enormous ship crashes into the planet, triggering an apocalypse. A female humanoid, a princess of her people, separated from her group after the door to the spaceship wreck being used as shelter breaks, manages to send a telepathic signal just as the explosion consumes her and the surface.Shaken, Valerian wakes.

She encourages him to keep pursuing Laureline, before dying.Valerian and Laureline venture further into the infected area, realizing that it is not radioactive. They reach a large, shielded hall where they find the humanoids with an unconscious Filitt. Their leader explains that his people lived peacefully on the planet Mül, when a battle broke out in orbit between the human government's fleet and another alien race. The human commander, Filitt, ordered the firing of a doomsday weapon that, despite knowledge that Mül was populated by a civilization, annihilated both the enemy fleet and Mül, as seen in Valerian's dream, sent to him by the princess and daughter of the humanoids' leader. A small group of survivors sheltered in a crashed spaceship and managed to repair it, learning much about technology and the history of other races in the process. They eventually came to Alpha, where they assimilated more knowledge and constructed a spaceship that could recreate their former home, their ""paradise"". The hall they are standing in is that spaceship, and they have kidnapped Filitt in order to recover the converter and the pearl they need to launch the ship. Filitt admits to his role in the genocide, but argues that the doomsday strike was necessary to halt the war, and that the cover-up was necessary to prevent the human race from being expelled from Alpha, as well as prevent reparations that would bankrupt the human government.Valerian has the pearl he took during the black market deal, and Laureline has the converter. Valerian gives them his pearl, but is reluctant to hand over the converter, as it is government property. Laureline convinces him to return it after pointing out the injustice their government perpetrated. While the spacecraft prepares for takeoff, Filitt's Pre-programmed robot soldiers attack both the humanoids, the government soldiers sent to assist Valerian, and their support staff, but are defeated by the support staff and Valerian's efforts. The spacecraft departs with the duo on-board, while Filitt is arrested. In a final scene in their own spaceship, Valerian and Laureline confess their love and expect to land at their own paradise in two hours."

In the near future, human organs are enhanced by the cybernetics technology developed by the powerful Hanka Robotics Corporation owned by Cutter. Dr. Ouelet is responsible for the development of the secret project 2571 of a full mechanical body to be connected to a human brain. She uses the brain of a young woman that lost her parents in a cyber attack as subject of a prototype. One year later, the woman is ranked Major and has joined Section 9, an anti-terrorist division commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki, working with agents Batou and Togusa. She needs to use a medicine to help the integration of her brain with the mechanical body and has no recollections of her previous life. When Section 9 hunts down the terrorist Kuze, Major learns the secrets about Hanka Robotics and the experiment she was subjected. Now she faces her ultimate enemy: Kuze, a criminal who has managed to hack into the brains of androids and control them.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In the near future, humans are augmented with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or ""shell"", that can integrate a human brain rather than an AI. The sole survivor of a terrorist attack which killed her parents, Mira Killian is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative. A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist division Section 9 commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa.—Paramount Pictures Rescued from a devastating terrorist attack, the orphan, Mira Killian, becomes a one-of-a-kind specimen of what begins to be the norm in a not-so-distant future: a cybernetically augmented human whose mind and soul resides in an immaculate synthetic body. As a result, the technologically advanced hybrid--now a resolute counter-cyberterrorism Major--is Sector 9's tip of the spear; however, when peculiar hallucinations interpreted as minor glitches start to bombard Mira's fragmented mind, suspicions will arise. Could those short and spontaneous outbursts be dormant, yet immortal memories of a suppressed past?—Nick Riganas In the near future, humans have become enhanced with cybernetic upgrades. Hanka Robotics Corporation is the top company in this type of technology, and is on the verge of developing a new kind of cyborg that uses a human brain to function. A woman named Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson) is being taken into Hanka after an accident. Her brain is placed into the body of a cyborg with greater strength and agility. Once the process is complete, her designer, Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche), speaks to Hanka Robotics CEO Cutter (Peter Ferdinando). Cutter wants to place Mira in Section 9, an anti-terrorism division, but Ouelet feels she is not ready for something like that.One year later, Mira is now known as The Major. She is on the roof of a building listening in on a meeting between Hanka representative Dr. Osmond and an African Ambassador (Chris Obi). The Major receives her orders from Section 9 Chief Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano) and works alongside Batou (Pilou Absaek) and Ladriya (Danusia Samal). In the conference, several geisha-bots start to attack the people in the room, leading The Major to spring into action, against Aramaki's orders. She goes invisible and jumps off the roof before swinging into the room and she starts shooting the geisha-bots. One of the geisha-bots hacks into Dr. Osmond's neck and kills him before The Major gets to it. The geisha-bot says ""Cooperate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed."" The Major shoots her in the head.The Section 9 team meets with Aramaki to discuss the attack. They learn that the geisha-bots were hacked from a mysterious source, also uttering the same phrase that the geisha-bot said to The Major. The rest of the team leaves but Aramaki talks to The Major about her move by jumping into the room. Aramaki informs her that she still has her ghost (her soul) within her shell (her cyborg body). The Major meets with Dr. Ouelet frequently to repair her body when it has been damaged. The Major has trouble remembering her past, only seeing brief glimpses and flashes. Ouelet dismisses her hallucinations as glitches, but she is shown to care for The Major.The Major and Batou are driving around the city. She mentions what little memory she has of her past, which involves her family dying getting to the country. On the road, The Major sees a hallucination of a burning hut. The Major and Batou meet with Dr. Dahlin (Anamaria Marinca) with the geisha-bot body. The Major deep-dives into the geisha-bot's AI to try and get more answers on the hacker. The Major finds herself walking through a club with distorted images. She is grabbed by the entity, forcing Batou to pull her out of the connection. The Major says she knows where to find the hacker.The Major and Batou go to a Yakuza nightclub with Ladriya. The Major is pulled into a room by two men who force her to dance while she is handcuffed to a pole and is zapped by a cattle prod. The room also blocks a signal for her to communicate with Batou. The Major then starts fighting the men in the room, kicking one out of the room and leading to a shootout that Batou engages in. He and The Major kill a number of goons before they head off to find the hacker. They run toward a room that is really a trap. A bomb goes off that damages The Major's body and blinds Batou.Batou receives cybernetic eyes to replace his damaged ones while The Major's body is repaired. Meanwhile, Cutter meets with Aramaki with anger over The Major doing the deep-dive. Aramaki warns Cutter who he is threatening since Aramaki answers to the Prime Minister and not Hanka. The hacker (Michael Pitt) finds Dr. Dahlin and rips her eyes out before killing her. The Section 9 team finds her body, and The Major pulls a drive out of Dahlin's hand which contains names of other Hanka associates, including Ouelet. They figure she is the hacker's next target.The hacker controls two sanitation workers to ram their truck into Ouelet's car. She survives but the men step outside and try to shoot her. The Major and her partners arrive in time to shoot back at the men. She chases after one man, Lee, as he runs by a body of water. The Major fights him while invisible until Batou shows up and stops her. Lee is interrogated after the hacker's connection is severed. He informs Section 9 that he was on his way to pick up his daughter. The Major shows him a photo of what he sees as his daughter, but is really a picture of himself. They determine that the hacker placed fake memories in Lee's head. The hacker, whose name is learned to be Kuze, then speaks through Lee to threaten Section 9 before making Lee jump to hang himself with the cable around his neck.Section 9 member Togusa (Chin Han) traces the hacker's signal to a hidden location. The Major finds Kuze as he is connected to a network with other humanoid cyborg bodies. Kuze reveals that he was a test subject of Hanka's, but considered a failure and a freak on account of his deformed outcome. The Major sees a tattoo on his chest of the burning hut like in her hallucination. Kuze says that Hanka took control over their lives instead of saving them.The Major confronts Ouelet over the revelation. Ouelet says that there were 98 failed experiments before The Major became the first successful one. The Major appears angry even as Ouelet tries to defend her position. Cutter orders Ouelet to terminate The Major on account of her being a liability. As The Major undergoes the process, Ouelet instead gives her an address so she can find answers for herself. Ouelet allows The Major to escape, so Cutter shoots and kills Ouelet in revenge. Cutter reports to Aramaki that The Major killed Ouelet and that she must be terminated.The Major follows the address to what turns out to be her old home. Her mother (Kaori Momoi) is there, having believed that her daughter ran away and was killed. The Major's real name was Motoko Kusanagi. Her mother does sense a familiar look in The Major's eyes when she looks at her. As she leaves, The Major gets in contact with Aramaki, who informs her that Ouelet is dead and that Cutter says she killed her, though they both know the truth. They allow Cutter to eavesdrop on their conversation as they plan their next move. Cutter sends his men to kill Section 9 members, but Batou, Togusa and Aramaki all survive and kill their attackers. The Major meets with Kuze at a hideout, which resembles the burning hut. They learn that Kuze's real name was Hideo, and they were originally against augmentations with humans and cyborgs.Cutter sends a spider tank to kill The Major and Kuze. However, the spider tank hits Kuze and severely damages him. The Major leaps onto the back of the spider tank and tries to rip its back open. She uses all her strength, causing her arm to rip off as she destroys the spider tank. Kuze offers to merge his ghost with her, but she refuses and he fades out. One of Cutter's snipers rides in on a chopper and kills Kuze. Aramaki sends his own man, Saito (Yutaka Izumihara), to take down the sniper to save The Major. Batou recovers The Major, who is still alive. Aramaki then corners Cutter after having spoken to the Prime Minister. Cutter is charged with Ouelet's murder and crimes against the state. Aramaki contacts The Major and gets her consent to execute Cutter. He shoots Cutter three times as he falls into his own pool.The Major visits her own grave with her mother, who now knows her daughter is still with her. The Major's voiceover states that she knows there will be more like her, but she knows her enhancements do not define her. She then returns to work with Section 9 and leaps off a building to her next mission."

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1972591/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Robbed of his birthright, Arthur comes up the hard way in the back alleys of the city. But once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to acknowledge his true legacy - whether he likes it or not. An alternative version of the King Arthur legend. As a boy, Arthur is left orphaned after his father, King Uther Pendragon, and mother are killed in a war waged against them by Vortigern, who then assumes the throne. Arthur flees and is raised in a brothel, knowing very little of his birthright. Vortigern wants Arthur dead, to ensure there is no claimant to the throne. The legends foretell that only the next king will be able to draw Excalibur, Uther's sword, from the rock where it is lodged. So, in an effort to identify Arthur, Vortigern forces all the young men of Arthur's age to attempt to draw out the sword. Now it is Arthur's turn.—grantss Mordred, an iron-fist-ed warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mag-es over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred's lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther's treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther's wife Igraine and slays Uther in combat. The only survivor is Uther's son Arthur, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium.. Struggling to eke out an existence in Londinium's squalid and perilous streets, the orphaned young fighter and Uther Pendragon's only son, Arthur, is utterly oblivious to the fact that he is England's rightful ruler. Nearly two decades after his traitorous uncle, Vortigern, usurped the throne, Arthur is now the only one who can pull out from the magical boulder the legendary and long-lost blade of Excalibur; however, Vortigern is hell-bent on identifying him, and then, stopping him. Can the evil tyrant stand in the way of Arthur's true destiny?—Nick Riganas Centuries ago in the Dark Ages, the evil mage Mordred (Rob Knighton) sought great power through the use of dark magic. Mordred and his army make their way to Camelot and begin laying waste to the kingdom of Britain as they ride on the backs of massive war elephants. King Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana) leads his own army against Mordred's forces. Uther rides his horse to reach Mordred's stronghold while wielding his mighty sword Excalibur. With one swing, Uther slays Mordred and puts an end to his reign of terror.Soon after, Uther's brother Vortigern (Jude Law) leads a coup against Uther and the kingdom. Vortigern takes his wife Elsa (Katie McGrath) underground to a pit where he kills Elsa and spills her blood to achieve a stronger form. Uther gets his wife Igraine (Poppy Delevignge) and young son Arthur out of the castle as Vortigern's minions, the Blacklegs, are closing in on them. As the villains begin causing chaos throughout the kingdom, Uther brings Igraine and Arthur by the docks. A figure approaches the family and hurls a spear at Igraine, killing her.Young Arthur is sent to the capital city of Londinium and is taken in to be raised in a brothel. As he grows older, Arthur spends his time on the streets, getting into trouble with other children and picking fights with those that harass him. As an adult (now played by Charlie Hunnam), Arthur grows stronger and more cocky and has made friends with Rubio (Freddie Fox) and Percival (Craig McGinlay)Arthur tends to his friend Lucy (Nicola Wren), a prostitute, who was previously assaulted by a group of Vikings. Arthur is later called to speak to a commander after Blacklegs raid the brothel. Arthur outed a man in hiding named Goosefat Bill Turner (Aiden Gillen), and he got into an altercation with the Vikings for hurting Lucy and forcing them to give up their wages. The commander tells Arthur that those Vikings were protected by the king, and therefore Arthur must pay for his crime. Arthur is taken and put onto a ship with other men headed for the kingdom. The Blacklegs also kill Lucy in front of Arthur and the other prostitutes just to spite him.Vortigern speaks to the Syrens that granted him his power after he killed Elsa. He does not yet have the full power he seeks, and the sirens tell him that once he kills Arthur and takes the power of the sword, he will succeed. Vortigern then learns that the sword has been found in a stone pulled out of the ocean.Arthur is brought forth to the stone with hundreds of other men as they are forced to attempt to pull the sword out. When Arthur steps out, he slowly feels the sword coming out of the stone. He sees flashes of images and senses a powerful and overwhelming energy that causes him to pass out.Arthur wakes up in Vortigern's dungeon. The king enters and explains to Arthur just what he had felt. He tells Arthur who his father was and how he is able to wield the sword. However, Vortigern intends to hold the power for himself, so Arthur must be dealt with.Uther's former general, Sir Bedevere (Djimon Hounsou), is met by a woman known as The Mage (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). She was sent by Merlin to help Arthur.Voritgern sentences Arthur to execution. The Mage hides and uses her powers to summon hawks to attack Vortigern's men while Bedevere and his men help Arthur get away. They bring him to their hideout, where Arthur awkwardly faces Bill after their previous encounter. Bedevere tells Arthur they need his help in defeating Vortigern, but Arthur refuses to help them. The others then doubt that he really can wield the sword as it was believed. Arthur knows they want him to fight them, and he initially chooses not to, until he sucker-punches Bill and tries to wield Excalibur by himself. This only causes him to faint once more.Bedevere later explains to Arthur how Vortigern had worked with Mordred the whole time to ensure that Vortigern would ultimately emerge victorious. His ultimate goal is to construct the Mage Tower, which had once been the source of Mordred's power, but if Vortigern completes it, he would be unstoppable. After Mordred rose to power, Uther came into possession of Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake (Jacqui Ainsley), leading him to kill Mordred.The Mage suggests to Bedevere to take Arthur to the Blacklands, where Merlin had destroyed Mordred's tower, so that he may train to learn how to control the sword. Arthur faces a number of creatures as he attempts to use the sword to his full potential. He receives help from a rebel named George (Tom Wu). As Arthur tries to grasp the power of the sword (literally), he sees a vision of the night his parents were murdered. He sees Vortigern's demonic knight form as he threw the spear at Igraine before dueling with Uther as he sent his son away. Vortigern overpowered him and nearly struck a fatal blow until Uther threw his sword into the air and let it impale him, thus turning him into the stone that held Excalibur and making him sink to the depths of the ocean below. Once Arthur understands his father's sacrifice, he decides to go kill Vortigern.Arthur and the rebels plan to meet with barons from other kingdoms to have them on their side to confront Vortigern. Arthur helps orchestrate meetings with the barons in the woods, which involves elaborate confrontations among his own men to show the barons that Arthur is someone they can follow.Vortigern's maid Maggie (Annabelle Wallis) is secretly a spy for Bedevere. She informs the rebels that Vortigern has also met with a Viking baron to form an alliance. The rebels plan to attack Vortigern when he arrives in Londinium. Once Vortigern and his men arrive, the rebels hide in a tower as Bill keeps an eye out. He readies his bow and arrow, only for Arthur to tell him that Vortigern has sent a decoy in his place. Bill still fires his arrow, leading to an attack. The rebels make a run for it, but Back Lack and Rubio get hurt during their escape. Back Lack stays behind, saying he will meet them at the safe house. Rubio sacrifices himself to allow Arthur and the others scale a wall to take refuge in the school run by George. The Blacklegs attack the school, forcing the rebels to fight back. Arthur sees the Mage being held at knife-point by a Blackleg. With a mighty swing of the sword, Arthur is filled with the magic of Excalibur and fights the Blacklegs single-handedly, killing them all.Chaos breaks out across Londinium that night as the rebels stay in a safe house. Rubio and his son Blue (Bleu Landau) arrive and join their friends. Vortigern's general Greybeard (Mikael Persbrandt) has followed Back Lack, leading the two villains to find and interrogate him. Blue runs back for his father, but must pretend not to know him to protect both of them. Vortigern then goes to cut off one of Back Lack's ears to see if Blue is telling the truth. Just before Vortigern cuts it off, Blue yells to make him stop. Despite his confirmation that he is the son, Vortigern cuts off Back Lack's ear anyway. After asking where Arthur and the sword are at, Arthur runs in to get Blue out of there. As Arthur picks up Blue, Blue watches Vortigern kills his father and Arthur takes him away.Feeling like a failure to his men, Arthur throws Excalibur into the sea. He walks through the woods and is pulled into a small pool by the Lady of the Lake. She shows Arthur a vision of what will happen if he does not stop Vortigern - people will die and the kingdom will perish should he achieve his ultimate power.Arthur returns to meet with Bedevere, George, and Percival. When they get back to their hideout, they find all of their friends and allies dead. Greybeard is there to deliver a warning to Arthur - if he doesn't surrender by the end of the day, Vortigern will kill both Blue and the Mage.Through a negotiation, the Mage is released when Arthur goes to turn himself and the sword in to Vortigern. Before anyone can harm Arthur, the Mage summons a giant snake to come in and eat Greybeard and the other Blacklegs. The rebels then go to free the rest of Vortigern's prisoners and begin to battle the Blacklegs.Knowing what's about to happen, Vortigern goes to his daughter's room [Catia (Millie Brady)], tells her Maidens to leave, hugs her, tells her he loves her so much, and then kills her as he did her mother. He takes her body down to the pit to sacrifice her and regain his Demon Warrior form. He brings Arthur to a completely different realm and fights him. Arthur puts up a good fight but is ultimately overpowered by Vortigern. Arthur then sees the vision of Uther before his death, with Arthur standing before his father. Before the sword hits Uther, Arthur grabs it, and Uther tells him it is time for him to wield Excalibur. Arthur continues the fight and tells Vortigern that everything that has brought Arthur to this moment is all thanks to Vortigern himself, due to his actions instigating Arthur to come fight. Arthur destroys Vortigern's blades and impales his treacherous uncle. Arthur leaves Vortigern with his dying breaths as the mage tower collapses.A while later, Arthur is seen constructing the Round Table. He knights George and Percival while keeping Bedevere and Bill in his circle. Arthur also cuts ties with the Viking baron and his men to avoid further conflicts. The Vikings peacefully kneel before the new king. Arthur is then presented with his crown as he goes to face his kingdom. The people cheer as Arthur raises Excalibur in the air."
Jigsaw,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3348730/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Bodies are turning up around the city, each having met a uniquely gruesome demise. As the investigation proceeds, evidence points to one suspect: John Kramer, the man known as Jigsaw, who has been dead for over 10 years. It has been over a decade since Jigsaw died. However, after a new series of murders occurs, police find themselves chasing after the original Jigsaw Killer - John Kramer. Could John Kramer still be alive or is another killer out there with a different motive?—Rebekah Swain The film starts with a chase between police and a criminal named Edgar Munsen (Josiah Black). After crashing his car against police cruisers, Edgar runs to a rooftop and is surrounded by police as he holds a trigger in his hand. He asks for Detective Halloran (Callum Keith Rennie), who shows up as the other cops have their guns drawn on Edgar. He tells Halloran that he has to decide who will die, or else Edgar himself will die. Halloran takes out his gun just as Edgar pulls the trigger. The cops blow off Edgar's hand and destroy the trigger, but someone has shot Edgar in the chest against Halloran's orders. A weakened Edgar tells Halloran that the game has begun.The scene then moves to a room where five people - Anna (Laura Vandervoort), Ryan (Paul Braunstein), Mitch (Mandela Van Peebles), Carly (Brittany Allen), and an unnamed fifth person - are chained to a wall with buckets on their heads. A recording plays from John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), explaining that in order to survive, blood must be given. The chains then start to pull the group toward the wall where buzz saws are sticking out. As they get closer, Anna cuts her arm and is freed. She tells the others to cut themselves to free themselves. Ryan and Mitch follow suit while Carly gets cut from behind. The fifth person is unconscious and realizes too late what to do, and he is seemingly killed.A woman is jogging through the park when she stops next to a crowd of people gathered by the bridge. She turns around and screams when she sees a body hung from the bridge by the neck with a bucket over the victim's head. The body is brought to the morgue where forensic pathologists Logan Nelson (Matt Passmore) and Eleanor Bonneville (Hannah Emily Anderson) inspect it, just as Halloran and his partner Hunt (Cle Bennett) arrive. Hunt offers condolences to Logan, whose wife passed away recently. The head on the body has been severed in half, presumably by the buzz saw. On the neck is a chunk of flesh cut off in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle. A small audio file is pulled out of the neck, with Kramer stating that now there are only four left.The four victims are now in a barn with the chains still on their necks. They start getting pulled toward another potential death until Mitch grabs a tape next to the infamous Billy puppet. The chains stop, and another audio recording from Kramer plays. He mentions that someone among them has been injected with a poison, and there are three needles before them - one with the antidote, one with a saline solution, and another with hydrochloric acid. Kramer personally calls out one of them as being a purse snatcher. It turns out to be Carly, who stole a purse from a woman that later died after she suffered an asthma attack and couldn't reach the inhaler in her purse. Carly notices one of the needles has the number 3.53 on it, which is how much she stole from the woman and how much Kramer deems her own life is worth. The chains start to pull the four up toward the ceiling to hang them until Carly takes a needle. Ryan, who grabbed all three, yells at Carly to take one, but she never does. Ryan sticks all three needles in Carly's neck, which releases them from the chains but also causes Carly to suffer a painful, bloody, burning death.Detective Halloran later finds the body of a woman whose face has been melted off by acid outside a building. Logan and Eleanor inspect the body and see another jigsaw-shaped flesh chunk missing.The remaining three victims figure that they are there for something wrong that they have done and must confess. Ryan admits to doing a number of bad things like cheating on his wife (and his second). Mitch sold a motorcycle to a young man who later died in an accident. Anna only recalls being with her husband when their baby died, supposedly as a result of him falling asleep and rolling over on top of the baby, smothering him. As they progress toward their next task, Ryan tries to walk out a door with a ""no exit"" sign, only to have his foot fall through the floorboard and get caught in razor-sharp wires that tighten around his leg. The next tape from Kramer instructs them on how they can get out of this. Anna and Mitch try to reach a lever to help Ryan, only for them to be trapped in a silo that starts to fill with grain. The grain stops pouring, and is followed by sharp falling objects (a rake, knives, needles, buzz saws). Ryan hesitates but reaches for the lever, saving Anna and Mitch but causing the wires to sever his leg.Edgar has been in an induced coma at the hospital following the gunshot. He then disappears when nobody notices. With the belief that the Jigsaw Killer is still out there, Halloran orders Kramer's grave to be dug up. The police open the coffin to find Edgar's body in there.Logan meets with Eleanor in a bar. He mentions how he doesn't trust Halloran and that he may have purposely shot Edgar during the initial rooftop standoff. Eleanor later invites Logan to her studio, which is full of recreations of Jigsaw's traps. She admits to having a strong fascination with his work, but also worries that this may implicate her in the recent murders. Hunt, who followed them, takes photos and plans to bring them to Halloran, but Logan tries to persuade Hunt that Halloran is the true culprit.Back at the barn, Mitch is put through the next test. He is hung up by his foot with wires and is slowly lowered toward a mechanism that would shred him. The next tape has Kramer stating that the young man he sold the motorcycle to was his nephew, and that Mitch willingly took the man's $600 knowing the brakes were faulty, and Kramer's nephew was soon struck by a truck. As Mitch is lowered, Anna tries to stop the mechanism by stopping a motorcycle engine that is powering it. Although she stops it long enough for Mitch to pull the lever that frees him, it turns back on and Mitch is completely shredded. Anna tries to make her escape through an open door, only to get caught.Anna wakes up in a basement, chained to the wall, as is Ryan, still alive with something on his leg to stop the bleeding. A man in a pig mask is standing there. He removes his mask to reveal himself as John Kramer. He addresses both people as having done horrible things. Ryan was reckless in his youth and caused his best friend to get into a fatal car accident when he tried to stop his drunken antics. Anna, who turns out to have been a neighbor of Kramer's, actually suffocated her baby and planted his body next to her husband to frame him. Her husband later hung himself in prison out of guilt. Kramer places a shotgun with one shell in the barrel, telling them their ""key to survival"" is now in the middle of the room. After Kramer leaves, Anna rushes to get the shotgun to kill Ryan. She grabs it and pulls the trigger, but it backfires and blows her brains out. Ryan sees the shell having contained a destroyed key to their chains. He weeps knowing he is doomed.Logan and Eleanor head over to the barn, only for Halloran to find them. Eleanor gets away, but Logan is caught by an unseen assailant.Logan and Halloran both wake up in a basement with devices around their necks that are rigged with laser cutters. They are standing in the middle of the room with two buttons, with a final tape giving them the choice to press a button that would kill or save the other. Halloran goes first and presses Logan's button. As the lasers start to activate, Logan admits his sin, which is that he was the doctor that mixed up Kramer's X-rays with another patient, meaning his cancer could have been detected earlier. The lasers appear to kill Logan, and Halloran thinks he is free, until he is pulled to the back of the wall, with the lasers activating on his device. Halloran pleads for mercy, admitting that he let innocent people die while real criminals walked free. Logan then rises, alive. He removes the device and walks over to pull off a sheet revealing the long-decomposed corpses of Anna and Ryan. Logan tells Halloran that he was the fifth person in the initial trap, and that it was ten years ago when it happened (making this entire film a half-prequel). Kramer let him live, knowing Logan made a simple mistake, and he took him in as an apprentice and to continue his legacy after his demise. The bodies that were found identical to Carly and Mitch were other criminals that Halloran let go. In fact, one of the criminals he let go was Edgar, who killed Logan's wife. He also let Eleanor live to establish an alibi. With Halloran's confession recorded, Logan starts to leave just as the lasers cut Halloran's head down the middle like a tomato. Logan says ""I speak for the dead"" before shutting the door."
American Assassin,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1961175/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the death of his girlfriend at the hands of terrorists, Mitch Rapp is drawn into the world of counterterrorism, mentored by tough-as-nails former U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. Stan Hurley. Twenty three-year-old Mitch lost his parents to a tragic car accident at the age of fourteen, and his girlfriend to a terrorist attack just as they were engaged. Seeking revenge, he is enlisted by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy as a black ops recruit. Kennedy then assigns Cold War veteran Stan Hurley to train Mitch. Together they will later on investigate a wave of apparently random attacks on military and civilian targets. The discovery of a pattern in the violence leads them to a joint mission with a lethal Turkish agent to stop a mysterious operative intent on starting a world war in the Middle East.—Anonymous Mitch Rapp and his girlfriend Katrina Harper are on vacation in Ibiza, Spain. Moments after Katrina accepts Mitch's proposal of marriage, a jihadist cell lands on the beach and begins to attack the civilians with assault rifles. Amid the carnage, Rapp frantically attempts to find Katrina, but his fiancee is killed by the terrorists. Eighteen months later, Rapp, now consumed by his desire for vengeance, frequents an internet message board where the terrorist responsible for his girlfriend's murder quizzes Rapp on aspects of Islam and jihad. Having secured an invitation to meet him face to face in Libya, Rapp prepares to take his vengeance on the man responsible for his girlfriend's death, but before he can kill the terrorist, the cell is suddenly ambushed by U.S. Special Forces. Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance, Rapp repeatedly stabs the terrorist he was after, who is already dead from the ambush, before being dragged out by the U.S. forces.. Black ops recruit Mitch Rapp is reeling from the death of his fiancée in a terrorist attack when he is assigned to shadowy CIA figure Stan Hurley to receive special training in tracking terrorists. Rapp and Hurley are then dispatched to join a Turkish agent on a mission to stop a mysterious operative from unleashing chaos of international proportions. While vacationing in Spain, Mitch Rapp (played by Dylan O'Brien) proposes to his girlfriend. She accepts but a few minutes later dies when a jihadist cell lands and guns down the tourists. The purpose was to make Americans see how it feels to have your loved ones killed.

Unknown to him, the watchful American government is impressed with his training. CIA agent Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) recruits him for a 'black ops' team and sends him to Dan Hurley (Michael Keaton), a former Navy Seal, for further training.World events move faster than expected, so Dan takes Mitch to Istanbul. In Turkey they meet with CIA agent Annika (Shiva Negar). Mitch and Annika pretend to be newlyweds in order to cover their real mission: prevent the jihadist construction of a nuclear bomb. Things don't go according to plan so Mitch improvises. Though he disobeys direct orders, his improvisation gets results.Further complicating this, Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), now a mercenary but formerly a member of Dan's group, works for the bad guys. In another plot twist, Annika works for the Iranian government. Too many things go wrong and the operation becomes a joint CIA and Mossad (Israel intelligence) collaboration. A final chase ends with the bomb headed for the U.S. navy fleet.Mitch throws the bomb overboard to let it detonate deep in the ocean. In the aftermath, an Iranian military man (secretly tied to the creation of the bomb) publicly blames the problems of his country on the U. S., which he promises to eliminate. He then gets into an elevator. Standing behind him is Mitch - the American Assassin."

A 17-year-old girl named Madeline Whittier has a rare disease that requires her to stay indoors 24/7 with her filtered air. Her whole life, basically, is books, her mom, and her nurse Carla. One day, a moving truck pulls in next door, and out steps Olly Bright, Maddy's new neighbor. They get to know each other through emails. The more they get to know each other, the deeper in love they fall. Olly makes Maddy realize she isn't really living; this starts the adventures of her new life.—Elle3 17-year-old Madeline Whittier lives with SCID, an immune disorder that prevents her from leaving her house and interacting with others. Her mother Pauline takes care of her with the help of her nurse Carla, who has been with them for 15 years. Only Pauline, Carla, and Carla's daughter Rosa are allowed in the Whittier home and around Maddy., who yearns to see the world, especially the ocean. One day, a new family moves in next door and their son, who is Maddy's age, catches her eye; they share a look as Maddy watches through the window. Later that night while Maddy and Pauline are watching a movie, the boy and his sister appear on their doorstep with a Bundt cake. Pauline politely rejects it, but as she is closing the door, the boy asks where her daughter is. The opening scene shows Madeline ""Maddy"" Whittier (Amandla Stenberg) sitting in what she considers her favorite room in the house. It gives her a nice view of the outside, as she enjoys imagining what it would be like to set foot out there, particularly in the ocean.Maddy explains that she has always lived with a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), meaning her antibodies are not able to properly fight off infection. Her mother (Anika Noni Rose) has kept her in the house for most of her life after she was a child and suffered multiple ear infections and cases of pneumonia. Maddy's brother and father also died in a car accident years earlier. Her only friends are her nurse Carla (Ana de la Reguera) and Carla's daughter Rosa (Danube R. Hermosillo), who are the only other people allowed in the house. Maddy is part of an online support group where she talks to other people with SCID. She spends most of her time immersing herself in books and writing reviews on them, as well as watching movies with her mom, or building models with an astronaut figure inside.One day, Maddy spots new neighbors moving in next door. She sees Oliver ""Olly"" Bright (Nick Robinson) riding his skateboard down the street. He looks up at Maddy's window and smiles at her. She smiles back.That night, Olly and his sister Kara (Taylor Hickson) walk over to the Whittier home to give them a bundt cake that their mom made. Dr. Whittier opens the door and politely declines the cake since it's coming from outside. When Olly asks if Maddy is around, Dr. Whittier firmly states she's not and then shuts the door.Over the next few days, Olly gets Maddy's attention from their windows. He fools around with bundt cake at first before writing his number down on the window. Maddy starts texting him and then imagines their conversation as though she were sitting in her model diner. They talk about their backgrounds, including Maddy's sickness and the deaths of her father and brother, as well as Maddy's desire to see the ocean.Both Carla and Rosa know that Maddy is into Olly. While her mother is away, Carla invites Olly to go to the house, but he must maintain a distance from Maddy so he can't get her sick.

Convinced, Olly drives them both to the airport.Dr. Whittier finds Maddy's note. She spots Kara walking down the street and asks her where Maddy and Olly are, but Kara knows just as little as she does.Maddy and Olly make it to Hawaii. They drive to a shack they've rented out, and Maddy goes to buy a swimsuit. They go to the ocean where Maddy swims for the first time. They then try out cliff-diving. Maddy has the time of her life. Later that night, Maddy and Olly make love for the first time.The next day, Maddy gets sick and she passes out. Olly takes her to the hospital, and Maddy wakes up back home. Dr. Whittier is not angry, because she feels that Maddy has learned her lesson from this experience. Maddy is then forced to cut Olly out of her life, feeling it is best for both of them to stop seeing each other.Olly moves back to New York City with his mother and sister to leave his father behind for good. Maddy doesn't get a chance to say goodbye. Later, she receives a phone call from a doctor that treated her in Hawaii. When Maddy mentions she has SCID, the doctor suggests that there is no indication of that disease in Maddy's system. Maddy then goes through her mother's files to find anything on SCID. When Dr. Whittier gets home, Maddy asks her if she really is sick. Dr. Whittier continues to dodge the question. Maddy runs outside, and her mom only tries to get her to go back without ever answering Maddy. Maddy runs away from her.Maddy goes to see a doctor to confirm that she never had SCID. Her immune system is only weak because it hasn't been properly exposed to regular viruses or infections. Angry, Maddy stays with Carla and Rosa. When she finally sees her mom again, Dr. Whittier tearfully admits that she lied to Maddy because she didn't want to lose her the same way she lost her husband and son.Maddy decides to go to New York City to visit Olly. She suggests that she will eventually forgive her mother. As Maddy hops on the plane, we see Dr. Whittier talking to Carla, presumably to apologize to her. Maddy sends Olly a message to meet her in a book store the following morning.Maddy goes to the book store. Sure enough, Olly is there reading a book.

The autopsy shows blunt trauma and sexual violence and confirms Cory's deduction that the girl died from exposure, specifically pulmonary hemorrhage caused by rapid inhalation of sub-zero air. However, the medical examiner is unable to confirm the death as a homicide, therefore preventing Jane from calling in an additional FBI investigative unit. The movie opens at night in a cold, remote Wyoming Wilderness on the Wind River Indian Reservation. Natalie Hanson, an 18-year-old Native American woman, is running barefoot through the snow while crying and looking back over her shoulder when we see the opening credits.The next scene shows Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) in full white camouflage shooting a wolf. Lambert is a hunter for the Fish and Wildlife Department who kills predatory animals in the area. The next scenes show Cory picking up his son from his ex-wife's house to take him out to the Indian reservation to visit her parents. It becomes evident that Cory lost his daughter at a young age.While out on one of his hunts, Lambert comes across the body of a young woman (Hanson). She's partly submerged in the snow with no shoes on, her toes and feet frostbitten, and a large wound on her forehead.Cory Lambert reports the crime to the Reservation Tribal Police who notify Natalie's parents, Martin and Annie Hanson. Corey waits with Ben (Graham Greene) who is the Tribal Police chief and oversees a staff of six officers for the entire reservation, which is the size of Rhode Island. They wait at the Hanson house as FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives during a snow storm. They take snowmobiles out to the location where Natalie's body is found. Jane labels the event as a homicide. After returning to town, they go to the medical examiner's office who explains that Natalie was raped by an unknown number of people, but that she died from the cold hitting her lungs and causing them to burst and she died alone. Jane is upset because its not being labeled a homicide, even though everyone knows she died while running for her life.Corey, Jane, and Ben all head to the rundown house of Sam Littlefeather, which is a drug den on the reservation as they look for clues. Upon arriving, they are fired upon by Sam as well as Chip Hanson (Natalie's brother). Cory is able to subdue Chip and another man while Jane pursues Sam Littlefeather in the house. Sam comes around a corner and fires at Jane, missing, while she is able to hit him with several rounds. He dies on the spot. They interview Chip, and the other man and Cory finds out that Natalie had a boyfriend named Matt who was a security guard at one of the local oil drilling camps in the mountains.While arresting Chip, Corey sees snowmobile trails going up the hill from the house and goes to track them along with Jane. Up the hill they find the dead body of Matt Rayburn, who was Natalie's boyfriend, being eaten and chewed on by birds, half buried in the snow.Jane, Ben, and two other deputies from Tribal police take snowmobiles all the way up to the oil drilling camp, which has several trailers on it for the workers to sleep while working up there. Cory decides to go back up the hill to further investigate Matt's death. They are greeted by the lead security guy for the drilling area. They ask him where Matt is and the security guy says he was hoping they might have answers and that he'd been missing for a few days. He has several scars on his face, as do two of the other security guards who come down as well. As they're walking to Matt's trailer, the lead security guy mentions them finding Natalie's body a few days ago and that he heard it on the radio. Jane replies surprised, saying We never said her name on the radio. As they get close to Matt's trailer, one of the Indian deputies notices that the other guards have their guns out and are flanking him and the group. He gets concerned, and everyone draws their weapons, and a standoff occurs. Jane's FBI rank outranks the other officers, and she takes control of the situation getting everyone to calm down. They walk to the trailer and Jane turns the door handle, and its locked. So she knocks.At this point, a flashback starts as Matt crawls out of bed and answers the door to find out that it's Natalie knocking. They kiss and hug, and then the scene fast forwards to them post coital relations, talking about where they want to run away to. As they talk, you can hear Matt's co-workers pulling up to the trailer. Natalie shuts the curtain as the men enter, intoxicated and loud. Pete, who is the drunkest of the group, opens the curtain and starts teasing Matt and Natalie, asking them what they've been up to. He finally tries to see under the covers, and Matt jumps out of bed to hit him and push him back. The rest of the guys grab Matt after he gets a few punches in on Pete. Natalie jumps on top of them, and she is thrown on the bed after being hit hard in the head, knocking her out. She falls onto the bed on her stomach and Pete proceeds to rape Natalie. She awakes as Pete is raping her and Matt frees himself from the other guys and starts to hit Pete. The whole group again goes after Matt, beating him, while Natalie is able to escape and start running away. It's clear that this is when she starts running for her life, which eventually leads to her death.The flashback sequence ends with Jane knocking on the door screaming ""FBI"". Corey from up on the mountain sees snowmobile tracks going from where Matt died down to the camp. He radios Ben to warn him about the security guys. Ben tells Jane to get away from the door, and at that point a loud explosion comes through the door... buckshot from a shotgun striking Jane in the chest and knocking her far back off the steps of the trailer. At this point, the gunfire starts, with the security guys all trying to shoot the members of the tribal police. Jane is alive because of her bullet proof vest but injured from the impact. The security guys manage to kill Ben and the other Indian Tribe officers, even though they are wounded as well. Jane is trying to reload her gun when the lead security guard takes it away from her. It's at this point that a bullet comes flying through his body out of nowhere to kill him. The other guards are looking around but can't find where the gunner is at. They both proceed to get killed by the mystery gunman who turns out to be Cory.Cory shoots into the trailer hoping to get the men who shot Jane from inside, one of whom is Pete who raped Natalie in the flashback. Cory hits the other man inside the house as Pete escapes out the back and runs into the hills. Cory comes over and attends to Jane and helps her with her injuries. He then proceeds to head up the hill and try and chase Pete. Pete is running and confused and looking for Cory as he can hear someone. He turns around, and Corey nails him in the face with the butt of his rifle. Pete wakes up to find he's been taken up to the top of the mountain and that his boots have been removed and his toes are getting frostbite already. Cory pushes Pete and gets him to confess to raping Natalie and killing Matt. Cory tells him he's free to go since he confessed, but first he tells Pete that Natalie ran six miles in the snow barefoot, and that he didn't think Pete would make it 600 feet. Cory tells him to run, and Pete starts to run, making it just a few dozen steps before the cold freezes up his lungs, just as it had done to Natalie's.The final scenes show Cory in the hospital talking to Jane, and the scene ends with Jane crying over all that they had been through. Then Corey goes to Martin Hanson's house where he finds Martin sitting outside with his death paint face paint on his face. Martin says he just invented death paint. Cory hints that they caught all the guys and that the man who killed Natalie went out with a whimper. Martin then starting to get choked up says ""I just want to sit here and miss her for a minute, will you sit with me?"" Cory sits with him, and a title screen comes up saying that statistics are kept for every group of missing people except native American women. Nobody knows how many are missing."
Geostorm,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981128/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack Earth, it's a race against the clock for its creator to uncover the real threat before a worldwide Geostorm wipes out everything and everyone. When catastrophic climate change endangers Earth's very survival, world governments unite and create the Dutch Boy Program: a worldwide net of satellites surrounding the planet, that are armed with geoengineering technologies designed to stave off the natural disasters. After three years of successful protection, something starts to go wrong. Two estranged brothers are tasked with solving the program's malfunction before a worldwide Geostorm can engulf the planet. In an attempt to save the planet from the devastating effects of extreme climate change, an eminent team of scientists led by Jake Lawson manages to build a powerful and elaborate network of satellites known as the ""Dutch Boy"", to practically control the weather. However, when unexplained accidents and catastrophic weather malfunctions start to occur, it's evident that what was invented to protect the Earth has now become its nemesis, wreaking havoc with random attacks. Can Jake and his estranged brother Max stop the string of dysfunctions before a Geostorm--an annihilating worldwide meteorological phenomenon--obliterates mankind?—Nick Riganas In 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites called ""Dutch Boy"". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a Senate sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom. Three years later, a UN team stationed in the Registan Desert comes across a frozen village. As suspicions rise about the event being caused by a malfunction of Dutch Boy, the US government decides to send one person to find and fix the system. Later, Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS), is shown copying data from the Afghanistan satellite onto an external storage device. Habib stores it in his station locker, but he is unexpectedly ejected into space and killed. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in Hong Kong, causing gas main explosions that nearly kill Max's college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy's Hong Kong department.. In the year 2019, global warming had become so bad, catastrophic weather was plaguing the world. The nations of the world came together to create a solution - a weather-controlling system nicknamed ""Dutch Boy"". It deploys satellites around the world and succeeds in containing a potentially devastating hurricane over Shanghai and manages to keep climate stabilized all across the globe.Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler), the main architect for Dutch Boy, is brought to testify before a court. Senator Thomas Cross (Richard Schiff) is particularly displeased that Jake went ahead and started Dutch Boy without his own approval. Jake fails to make a compelling argument for his case, choosing instead to just argue with the senators, justifying that Dutch Boy has proven to be a success. Jake's brother Max (Jim Sturgess) tries to shut him up but to no avail. After the meeting is adjourned, Max tells Jake that he has been chosen to take Jake's job, and he regrettably fires his brother.Three years later, a team of soldiers move through Afghanistan. They come across a village that appears to have been frozen over, covered in ice and snow. The soldiers find the villagers standing frozen in place.Up on the International Climate Space Station, an engineer, Makmoud (Richard Regan Paul), gathers log data from the Afghanistan incident in secret. He moves through the station when the windows start to blow out, causing Makmoud to get sucked out into space.President Andrew Palma (Andy Garcia) is alerted to the incidents and he calls for a meeting among his Cabinet. They determine that there must have been a glitch in one of the satellites over Afghanistan. Palma proposes to send one person up to the ICSS to fix the situation. Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom (Ed Harris) talks to Max and suggests that he get Jake to go up there since he knows Dutch Boy better than anyone involved, but Max thinks it wouldn't help to ask Jake.Max drives up to Jake's home in Florida where he meets Jake's daughter Hannah (Talitha Bateman). Jake appears none too pleased to see Max, but Max pleads with his brother to help him investigate the Afghanistan incident, knowing that many lives could potentially be at risk.We move to Hong Kong where a heatwave has passed over the city. A man named Cheng Long (Daniel Wu), who heads Dutch Boy's Hong Kong department, is leaving a grocery store when he drops his carton of eggs. To his surprise, the eggs start frying on the street. Suddenly, the ground rumbles before gas mains start to burst underground and explode. Cheng races across the city as more mains start to blow, causing an earthquake that destroys part of the city. Cheng makes it to the middle of a bridge as he and other citizens look upon what remains of the city.Jake agrees to go up to the ICSS, even though he knows he will leave Hannah behind. She tearfully says farewell to him before staying with her mother.When Jake reaches the ICSS, he meets Ute Fassbinder (Alexandra Maria Lara), the station's commander, plus her crew - Duncan Taylor (Robert Sheehan), Ray Dussette (Amr Waked), Eni Adisa (Adepero Oduye), and Al Hernandez (Eugenio Derbez). Together, they look into Hong Kong's satellite, but the robot arm holding it goes haywire, nearly killing everyone until it crashes, leaving the satellite destroyed with no data to work with.In Tokyo, an enormous hailstorm hits (literally), bringing down hail big enough to destroy a bus.From Hong Kong, Cheng contacts Max after finding out he cannot login to access their satellite. Cheng warns Max that if this pattern of weather continues, a geostorm will occur, in which disastrous weather will strike all over the globe at once. Cheng escapes his office when he finds that mercenaries, led by a man named Rico (David S. Lee) are about to raid the place.Max then turns to Dana (Zazie Beets), a cybersecurity hacker. She finds that Max cannot gain access to the satellite as well, meaning that the whole system has been hacked by someone else.Jake sees in a surveillance video of the accident that killed Makmoud that a hard drive got stuck by a panel. He goes out to retrieve it, but his space suit malfunctions and he is nearly killed. After making it back inside the station, he shows Ute that he got the drive, but he keeps it a secret from the rest of the crew, fearing that one of them may have deliberately sabotaged him. While attempting to go over the drive, Jake and Ute find themselves unable to access the information. Jake video-calls Max and tells him a story about their father taking them fishing. Max takes the video to Dana and says it's an encrypted message from Jake since their dad never did take them fishing. Using their dad's old phone number, Max decrypts the message to learn that Jake believes someone within the White House is responsible.Max attempts to meet up with Cheng. Rico is behind him, and he pushes Cheng into the path of a car. Max rushes to a dying Cheng, who manages to mention something called Project Zeus before he dies. He relays this info to Dana, stating that Project Zeus is meant to manipulate the weather and create the geostorm.Jake and Ute find the log data in the locker that Makmoud had stored it in, which is Dussette's locker. He initially thinks they suspect him of sabotaging Jake, even holding them at gunpoint, but they come to an understanding. They find out that a virus was spread to keep ICSS employees from logging in. Jake contacts Max again with the suspicion that Palma may be behind the hack. In order to stop the geostorm from happening, they need to reboot the system with kill codes, which are with the President as they are bio-metric and require his fingerprints and eye scan. Max tells this to his girlfriend, Secret Service Agent Sarah Wilson (Abbie Cornish), as he needs her help to get Palma.Max and Sarah head to the Democratic National Convention in Orlando, where Max learns that a huge thunderstorm is about to hit the area. When he tries to warn Dekkom and ask for his help, Dekkom takes Max to a room and tries to shoot him, revealing himself as the true villain. Max rushes to tell Sarah. She creates a diversion to get the other Secret Service agents away while she gets Palma. She and Max take him in a self-driving cab just as the storm hits. They get far away from the stadium as it is blown up by a massive lightning bolt. Sarah drives through the city evading Rico and his goons. They go under a bridge and manage to push Rico into the path of the storm, causing a bolt to hit his car and blow him up. Dekkom is ahead in the road and uses one of his goons to try and kill Max, Sarah, and Palma with an RPG. The car blows up, but they are not inside. Max and Sarah incapacitate the goon and hold Dekkom until the police arrive to arrest him. Before he is taken away, Dekkom says his plan was to take out America's enemies and leave the United States in charge of the world, with him as President.The virus starts to completely take over the station, causing its self-destruct sequence to go off. The satellites then go out of control, causing devastating weather to hit parts of the world, including a tsunami in Dubai, a heatwave in Moscow, and tornadoes in Mumbai. People are frozen in their tracks, burned alive, or sucked up. The geostorm then counts down to less than 90 minutes. Jake soon learns that Duncan is responsible for spreading the virus. Jake goes to beat the crap out of him and learns he did it because he was offered more than what he was payed up there. Duncan accidentally hits the windows with bullets before Jake gets out, just as the window blows out and sucks Duncan into space.Max and Sarah get Palma to send the kill codes. Jake contacts Max and says the kill codes will only stop the geostorm but not the self-destruct sequence. Jake prepares to die despite Max trying to find a way to help. The brothers acknowledge their love for each other. Jake rushes to take the kill codes to the main computer, with Ute staying behind to help him. Once they do so, they manage to stop the geostorm, bringing all the crazy weather to a halt. As the station continues to crumble, Jake and Ute find a nearby pod. The station is obliterated, leaving everyone thinking Jake is dead. Hannah watches at home with her mother and starts crying. Max is then alerted to a video from a nearby shuttle that the pod is signaling for help. The shuttle, flown by Hernandez, stops to grab the pod, saving Jake and Ute. They are brought back to Earth, with Max and Hannah both feeling relieved.Six months later.Jake gets his old job back working on a new Dutch Boy system. He, Max, and Hannah are shown trying to fish since they never did as kids, but they decide it's too boring. We then hear Hannah's voiceover saying that while we cannot change the past, we can only hope to make the future better."
Fist Fight,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3401882/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When one school teacher unwittingly causes another teacher's dismissal, he is challenged to an after-school fight. On the last day of school, right on Senior Prank Day in Roosevelt High, things don't look good for meek English teacher Andy Campbell, who feels exceptionally expendable facing a bleak future in front of severe job cuts, just before the year's new school season. But soon, things will go from bad to worse when feeble Campbell will infuriate the scary hot-headed history teacher Ron Strickland, who in turn, he will challenge him in an old-school, no-holds-barred, mano-a-mano throwdown in front of everybody, in the parking lot after school. Inevitably, now that the fight is on, no excuses, no regrets, and certainly no talking sense into Strickland, is going to save Campbell who needs to face the consequences of his actions and pay the heavy price. After all, snitches get stitches.—Nick Riganas It is the last day before summer vacation at Roosevelt High School in Atlanta, and the students are out of control, devising elaborate Senior Pranks and creating chaos. Andy Campbell, the school's mild-mannered and nerdy English teacher, and his fellow faculty members are trying to survive the chaotic day as best they can, but only the history teacher Ron Strickland is fierce enough to intimidate the students into behaving. Meanwhile, Campbell is awaiting news of the birth of his second child with his wife Maggie. While teaching, Campbell is pulled aside by his school counselor friend Holly, to inform him of rumors of downsizing of all departments. Given his pregnant wife and child, this renders Campbell extremely anxious.. It's the last day for students and staff at Roosevelt High School. The seniors are wild and unruly, setting off pranks on their classmates and teachers. English teacher Andy Campbell (Charlie Day) has his parking spot taken by a student on a scooter, and he is too meek and sensitive to do anything about it. History teacher Ron Strickland (Ice Cube) is the most feared teacher in school. He catches two boys taking a prized bat from the school's cage and replacing it with a computer so they can watch porn. Strickland orders them to put the bat back and leave.Some of the teachers are worried because they have evaluations later that day that will determine the fate of their jobs. Campbell in particular is worried because he and his wife Maggie (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) are expecting their second child. Campbell gets pranked in his class when students draw dicks on his board. He gets pulled out by guidance counselor Holly Grossman (Jillian Bell) to let him know that some of the other English teachers have got fired, so his job might be safe.In the teachers' lounge, Campbell, Holly, and their friend Coach Crawford (Tracy Morgan) discuss the possibility of losing their jobs when one teacher who had worked there for 22 years has just been fired. He prepares to take some stuff from the lounge until Strickland shows up and scares him. Strickland tries to use the new coffee machine while complaining that the school's budget goes to stupid stuff. Campbell shows him how to work the coffee machine, but Strickland doesn't like how the coffee comes out.Campbell catches a student jerking off in the bathroom. He tries to get him to stop but is overheard by drama teacher Ms. Monet (Christina Hendricks). She considers Campbell a pervert following this encounter.On his way to class, Campbell is stopped by Strickland because he needs help in the class with AV equipment. Campbell says he can't and has to go to class, but Strickland stops him before he gets hit with some paint that the students set up as a prank. Campbell then decides to go and help out in the class. Strickland is playing a video on a VCR but notices that the picture will play for a few seconds before turning off. Campbell sees that one student, Neil (Austin Zajur), is playing a prank by using a remote app on his phone to turn the TV off. Strickland takes his phone and smashes it against the chalkboard. As they resume the film, a girl passes her phone to Neil to continue the prank. When he does it again, Strickland leaves the classroom and returns with a fire ax. The students run away freaked out as Strickland swings down on Neil's desk and chops it to bits.Strickland and Campbell are called into Principal Tyler's (Dean Norris) office after he hears about the incident. Strickland tells Campbell they need to stick together as teachers. However, Tyler threatens to fire both of them if he doesn't get a clear answer. Campbell caves and blames Strickland, resulting in Strickland getting fired. As payback, Strickland challenges Campbell to a fight later that day after school.Soon, word spreads around the school that the two teachers will fight each other. People spread rumors around as to why Strickland is so feared. They say he's an ex-cop, Special Forces, or just a plain old crazy killer guy. Holly and Crawford are confident that Strickland is going to kill Campbell with one punch. Campbell tries to do what he can to avoid anything from happening.Ms. Monet approaches Strickland after hearing about the fight. Since she thinks Campbell is a pervert, she suggests to Strickland that he use a knife against Campbell.Campbell tries to get Neil to take his word back on the classroom incident. Neil demands a MacBook Pro in return. Desperate, Campbell rushes to the nearest computer store to get one. He runs into Maggie and their daughter Ally (Alexa Nisenson). Maggie is worried that Campbell is there because he lost his job due to not sticking up for himself, which Ally agrees with. When asked about the computer, Campbell passes it off as a surprise for Maggie. Ally reminds him that he is helping her with a talent show performance later, but instead of their rehearsed dance to a ""Rent"" song, she wants to use a Big Sean song because she is worried about getting bullied by another girl. Campbell agrees and then has to run and get another MacBook.Campbell and Neil tell Tyler that the incident was made up so that Strickland can get his job back. Both Campbell and Strickland are called into the Model UN room for a mediation. Campbell tells Strickland the issue was resolved and he got his job back, but Strickland is even more mad over this since Campbell didn't talk to him about it. The fight is still on.Campbell makes a 911 call to report the impending beatdown. The operators on the other end laugh when Campbell tells them he's a teacher about to get beaten by another teacher.Campbell starts to have a breakdown in his classroom. He falls victim to a prank (literally) when the students put a rope around his feet and use a horse doped up on meth to drag him out of the class and get sprayed with paint. Crawford also gets sprayed as well. Campbell then decides he's had enough and wants to put an end to the nonsense. He plans to set Strickland up by planting drugs in his classroom and getting him arrested.Campbell gets what is believed to be molly from Neil. On his way to Strickland's class, he runs into Tyler, who tells him his evaluation is now at 2:15, right before Ally's show. Campbell plants the drugs in Strickland's class and waits for the cops outside with Holly and Crawford. The drug-sniffing dog fails to sniff the drugs, and the cops leave. Holly takes out a joint, which Campbell grabs and runs into the class with so he can lure the cops back. Strickland is already in the class and knows what Campbell is up to. Campbell lights the joint and brings back the cops plus campus security guard Mehar (Kumail Nanjiani). Both Strickland and Campbell get arrested.In their cell, Campbell blames Strickland for getting them into this mess. Campbell goes over to a large inmate (Winston James Francis) and tells him that Strickland called him a bitch and that he wants to fight him. He tells the big guy to look out for Strickland nodding as the signal. Campbell goes back over to Strickland to instigate things, but Strickland says the fight is off since he only did it to prove a point in that the school doesn't care about what goes on if students are running around uncontrollably, and that Campbell isn't even man enough to fight. When Campbell tries to clarify that the fight is off, Strickland nods, bringing the big inmate over. Strickland realizes that Campbell set them up, so he takes down the big guy with a sleeper hold and tells Campbell the fight is still on. A cop comes over and says the guys are free to go because the molly was really aspirin.It's now 2:00. Campbell rushes back to the school for his evaluation. Crawford comes out and tells Campbell that he, Holly, and Monet have all gotten fired. Campbell is forced to wait outside when it is nearly 2:30, meaning he will be late for Ally's show. Campbell barges into Tyler's office and sees him listening to a story from the superintendent (Dennis Haysbert). Tyler says that they've fired enough teachers for the day and must discuss upcoming changes to the school. When Campbell asks, Tyler says it's none of his business. Campbell finally puts his foot down and tells off Tyler and the superintendent for making him wait outside and trying to hurt the school even more. He tells them they suck at their jobs and he leaves.Campbell rushes to Ally's school and comes in as she has done a pitiful solo performance of the ""Rent"" song. He goes over to Maggie and gets the DJ to play the Big Sean song. Campbell talks to Ally and apologizes for being late. They go out on stage to play the song. What Campbell didn't know is that the song Ally wants to play is ""I Don't Fuck With You"", which Ally directs to her bully, Trisha. Another teacher cuts off the music, but the rest of the kids love Ally's performance. Campbell is proud of her and runs off to the fight.The entire student body is gathered outside for the big fight. Campbell is cheered on for showing up. He faces Strickland and the fight begins. Strickland gets the first punch easily, but Campbell gets back on his feet and gets some good swings in. He bites Strickland's leg and also gets him with a stapler. Strickland uses more force in the fight, but Campbell doesn't stay down. He runs back into the school, and everyone follows. Campbell tackles Strickland to the ground. He then gets a fire extinguisher to spray Strickland and then whacks him over the head with it, taking him down. The students and staff cheer Campbell on as he runs outside, only for Strickland to come back and punch his lights out. Maggie then calls, and Strickland answers the phone. Strickland wakes Campbell up to inform him that Maggie is going into labor. He pulls Campbell up and takes him to the hospital.Campbell goes to Maggie's room to meet with her. He explains everything he's been through that day and that he is finally going to stand up for himself. They then get ready for the baby.Sometime over the summer, the Campbells are having a barbecue with Holly, Crawford, and other friends. Ally is now more popular with the other kids. Tyler shows up and tells Campbell that the fight attracted a lot of attention to the school board, and he must ask both him and Strickland to return to work because his own job now depends on it. Campbell agrees to return on one condition.The final scene takes place on the first day of the new school year. Campbell got Tyler to rehire Holly, Crawford, and Monet.

In the middle of winter, Alex Martin and Ben Bass, a Guardian newspaper photojournalist specializing in stories in conflict zones and a neurosurgeon respectively, meet by chance when they are both booked on the same Boise to Denver flight, canceled due to weather with no other flights leaving until the next morning. This cancellation causes a problem for both as Alex has to catch a connecting flight to New York City for her wedding the next morning, while Ben has to catch a connecting flight to Baltimore, his home base, for a delicate surgery also the next morning. Overhearing Ben's situation, Alex suggests they charter a plane to Denver, they managing to find a willing pilot in Walter, who believes they can beat the storm. However, in the air, Walter experiences medical distress causing the plane to crash into the snow covered mountains high above the treeline. While Walter dies in the process, Ben, with minor injuries, and Alex, with a serious gash in her leg, survive the crash, along with Walter's golden lab. With nothing functioning on the plane and as no one knows that they were on this flight as Walter didn't file a flight plan, as Alex didn't telephone her fiancé Mark, and as Ben didn't telephone his wife Sarah, they realize their situation is precarious with no one looking for them in this circumstance. While logically minded Ben believes they are better off staying put with the plane, Alex just cannot sit still in her want to try and make their way to civilization. They have to overcome several physical obstacles, but it may be the emotional hurdles that they have to deal with with each other which may be more problematic, especially as deep in their hearts they ultimately do not believe they are going to survive this situation.—Huggo In the face of an incoming blizzard, while stuck in Salt Lake City International Airport, perfect strangers, free-spirited photojournalist, Alex Martin, and straight-laced brain surgeon, Dr Ben Bass, charter a small plane to reach Denver. Instead, they find themselves injured, freezing, and stranded in a snow-covered ridge in the heart of the unforgiving High Uintas Wilderness, along with the pilot's golden retriever. Now, the lucky but utterly unprepared survivors have to brave the elements and work together to stand a fighting chance to live. However, amid cruel dilemmas, and when all hope seems lost, how do you trust someone you have just met?—Nick Riganas Stranded after a tragic plane crash, two strangers must forge a connection to survive the extreme elements of a remote snow covered mountain. When they realize help is not coming, they embark on a perilous journey across hundreds of miles of wilderness, pushing one another to endure and discovering strength they never knew possible.—Twentieth Century Fox The film starts at an airport. Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) is trying to fly to Denver for her wedding, only to be told that her flight has been canceled due to an impending storm. At the same time, Ben Bass (Idris Elba) is attempting to fly in order to perform heart surgery on a 10-year-old boy, but his flight has also been canceled. Alex approaches Ben and offers a solution to their problem.The two walk over to meet Walter (Beau Bridges), a man owning a charter plane that can get them to their destination. Walter brings his dog along, and the dog doesn't immediately take too kindly to Ben.On the flight, Alex tells Ben that she's a photographer who was in the area photographing neo-Nazis. Alex then notices the storm clouds appearing overhead. As Walter is contacting someone over the radio, he begins to suffer a stroke. Ben goes over to help, but Walter loses motor function and the plane goes crashing down into the mountains.Ben wakes up at night. He finds that Walter is dead, but the dog survived. Alex is unconscious and has a severely broken leg. He treats it and wraps it up before he passes out.In the morning, Ben walks out of the wreckage. He pulls Walter's body out and buries him in the snow.The next day, Alex wakes up. Ben tells her what's happened. They figure they have a limited food supply and must do what they can to flag someone down to rescue them. They spend some time talking to each other to ease their minds over their situation.Ben sees a plane flying overhead and tries to get its attention by shooting a flare, but it doesn't work. He goes out to look for anything that can help them while Alex stays in the plane. While alone, Alex listens to a recorder that Ben keeps with a message from his wife, who apparently left Ben. Ben slips and nearly falls over a cliff but is stopped short of the edge by a rock. Meanwhile, a cougar stalks Alex and the dog outside the plane. The dog barks and runs out to face the cougar, but the dog is bitten in the neck. The cougar goes for Alex, but she fires a flare at its face, causing it to retreat. When Ben comes back, he treats the dog's neck wound and finds the cougar's corpse. He cooks the cougar to feed himself, Alex, and the dog. Alex thinks they should move forward instead of waiting around for help, but Ben disagrees with her.After a few days, Alex and Ben leave the plane behind and start to head down the mountain as Alex has spotted a light reflection in the distance through her camera lens. They take the dog and start moving downward, only to encounter a river at the bottom of the cliff with no way around it. They seek shelter in a cave for the night.Alex and Ben continue their trek down the mountain in the morning. They start to worry that they might die up there. Ben asks Alex to take a picture of him since it may be the last one taken of him before he dies. Alex recounts a story in which she met a girl who was later caught in an explosion. Instead of getting the girl help, Alex took her picture right before she died. Therefore, she refuses to take Ben's picture.As they continue their walk, they become separated from the dog. Ben goes after him and finds a cabin. As he looks through it, Alex feels the ground beneath her cracking. She realizes she is standing over thin ice, and she falls through into the ice cold water. Ben hears the cracking and sees Alex go down. He runs over and pulls her out, but she is unconscious and almost blue. Ben brings her to the cabin and starts a fire to warm her up.Alex remains unconscious for a couple of days but she eventually wakes up. While Ben is out looking for help, Alex listens to the recording from his wife again, but Ben catches her this time. Alex apologizes but Ben is clearly upset. When he is about to go out again, Alex kisses him, leading to them having sex. Afterwards, Ben tells Alex about his wife. Her name was Sarah, and they were married for eight years. She developed a brain tumor and left him when they realized it was out of his control, and she later died.Ben later leaves the cabin and spots a lumber mill in the distance. As he is going back to the cabin with the dog, his foot gets caught in a bear trap. Alex sets off on her own to the lumber mill as quickly as she can. She manages to flag down a truck driver before she passes out.Ben wakes up in the hospital. He walks over to Alex's room to find her with her fiancee, Mark (Dermot Mulroney). He thanks Ben for saving Alex's life, though Ben insists she saved him. He leaves the room heartbroken.Alex and Ben eventually return to their lives. Ben goes back to England to his home in South London and adopts the dog. Alex continues her life with Mark, but she still misses Ben. While hosting a party, a friend suggests to Alex that she shares whatever photos she took during her ordeal, though Alex declines since one picture is of Ben after they slept together. Alex then tries to call Ben, but he continues to decline her calls. Mark later talks to Alex and states he would always love her even if she never came back quite whole.Alex sends Ben some of the photos from their time on the mountain, with a note saying only he will understand what they mean. This inspires him to finally call Alex back.Some time later, the two meet in Manhattan at a restaurant. Ben says he never called Alex back because he thought she would be married already, but Alex says she couldn't go through with it. She tells Ben that she fell in love with him on the mountain, though Ben can't bring himself to admit he wants her back. They part ways after a hug, but they quickly regret leaving each other. They immediately turn around and run back into each other's arms."
Life,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5442430/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A team of scientists aboard the International Space Station discover a rapidly evolving life form that caused extinction on Mars and now threatens all life on Earth. Life tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. As the crew begins to conduct research, their methods end up having unintended consequences and the life form proves more intelligent than anyone ever expected.—Sony Pictures A crew aboard the International Space Station (ISS) performs a successful capture of a space probe returning from Mars with a sample inside. The crew is tasked with studying the sample, which may be the first proof of extraterrestrial life. However, the study eventually backfires as the organism gains intelligence. Trapped aboard the ISS with the rapidly-growing organism, the crew must find out how to kill it before it manages to escape and decimate Earth.—purplelammashta In near future, a group of international scientists was sent from Earth to explore unknown Mars at International Space Station (ISS). They got a soil sample from Mars which contained a sleeping cell. After a series of attempts they woke up such cell and it was growing bigger day by day. During an experiment the living thing attacked scientists and escaped from the highly sealed laboratory through an internal air vent. Those horrified scientists, on the one side they needed to protect themselves from being killed by this deadliest creature, on the other side they needed to terminate it before it was too late. However, this smart alien would do anything to survive.—Hongkonger In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 space probe returns from Mars to Earth orbit with soil samples potentially containing evidence of extraterrestrial life.

Exobiologist Hugh Derry, who is paralyzed from the waist down, revives a dormant cell from the sample, which quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name ""Calvin"". Hugh realizes that Calvin's cells can change their specialization, acting as muscle, sensor, and neuron cells all at once.. In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 space probe returns from Mars to Earth orbit with soil samples potentially containing evidence of extraterrestrial life. The probe is intercepted by the International Space Station, whose six-member crew retrieves its samples. Exobiologist Hugh Derry revives a dormant cell from the sample, which quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name ""Calvin."" Derry realizes that Calvin's cells can change their specialization, acting as muscle, neuron, and photosensory cells all at once.When Derry conducts further research on Calvin, it crushes his hand and knocks him unconscious. Calvin escapes its enclosure and it devours a lab rat, growing in size. Engineer Rory Adams rescues Derry, but is quarantined in the lab when Calvin attacks him. Adams tries to fight off Calvin, but is devoured; Calvin escapes through a fire-control vent. Soon after, the station's communication system overheats, cutting off all contact with Earth. ISS commander Ekaterina Golovkina performs a space walk to find and fix the problem, which turns out to be Calvin. Calvin attacks her and ruptures her spacesuit's coolant system. As her suit fills with coolant, Golovkina blindly makes her way to the airlock. She and the crew realize that Calvin will re-enter the station if they let her in, so she chooses to stay outside and drowns in her spacesuit.Calvin attempts to re-enter the station through its maneuvering thrusters. The crew fire the thrusters to blast it away, but they drain so much fuel that it causes the ISS to enter a decaying orbit, where it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Pilot Sho Murakami suggests using the ISS's remaining fuel to get back into a safe orbit even though it will allow Calvin to re-enter. The crew seal themselves in one side of the station and prepare to vent the atmosphere from the other side to render Calvin dormant. Derry suddenly dies and the crew finds Calvin feeding on his leg and are attacked. Murakami seals himself inside a sleeping pod, while Calvin tries to break inside. Physician David Jordan and Quarantine Officer Miranda North use Derry's corpse as bait to lure Calvin away and trap it in the other side. They discover a Soyuz spacecraft is on its way to intercept an earlier distress call from the ISS. As the Soyuz pushes the ISS out of Earth's orbit, Murakami tries to board the craft, which results in the Soyuz crashing into the ISS, killing him and the Soyuz crew and causing the ISS's orbit to decay again.The remaining survivors, Jordan and North, speculate that Calvin could survive re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, so they plan to lure Calvin into one of the ISS' two escape pods. Once inside, Jordan will manually pilot Calvin's pod into deep space, isolating it and allowing North to return to Earth in the other pod. Their plan works apparently. However, North's pod is eventually hit by debris, while Jordan is attacked by Calvin. As North's pod flies in one direction, she records a black box message to warn Earth of Calvin's threat. Eventually, one of these two pods lands on the sea and is found by Vietnamese fishermen, while the other pod was knocked away from Earth. What the Vietnamese fishermen finds turns out to be Jordan's pod -- not North's. The Vietnamese fishermen then open Jordan's pod despite his warnings, as other boats are shown arriving at the scene, and North's pod is shown flying uncontrollably into deep space while she screams."
"I, Tonya",2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580036/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Competitive ice skaterTonya Hardingrises amongst the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes. From the proverbial wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Oregon, former competitive figure skaterTonya Hardingwas never fully accepted in the figure skating community for not inherently being the image of grace, breeding, and privilege that the community wanted to portray, despite being naturally gifted in the sport athletically. Despite ultimately garnering some success in figure skating being national champion, a world championship medalist, an Olympian, and the first American woman to complete a Triple Axel in competition, she is arguably best known for her association to ""the incident"": the January 6, 1994 leg-bashing attack on her competitor,Nancy Kerrigan--who, unlike Tonya, was everything that the figure-skating community wanted in their representatives. Her association to that incident led to Tonya being banned from competitive figure skating for life. Tonya's story from the beginning of her figure-skating life at age four to the aftermath of the incident is presented. Besides Tonya herself, key people in her life give their perspective of their role in her life. Although they may agree on the broad issues at hand, such as that the incident did occur, they may vary widely in their recollection of the details. These people are: her waitress motherLavona Golden, who despite having paid for her expensive figure-skating lessons, was abusive toward her physically and emotionally, never believing she was good enough in any aspect of the word, and who pulled her from school to focus solely on the figure skating;Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest-serving coach, who, for good or bad, largely let Tonya be Tonya in the way she presented herself to the figure skating world;Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, and partner in a turbulent relationship on a need to be loved, perhaps without truly loving each other; Jeff's friend and Tonya's bodyguardShawn Eckardt, a dim bulb who believed himself to be a bigger player in the big scheme of life than he actually was; and sports journalist Martin Maddox, a fictional character who provides general commentary of what the sports media as a collective wanted out of Tonya and the incident.—Huggo Loved for a fleeting moment, then hated for life,Tonya Harding, the child prodigy who was forced into the realm of skating by her overbearing, abusive motherLavona Golden, recounts her bumpy life. From her damaging relationship with her first beau,Jeff Gillooly, to her utter defeat in the 1992 Winter Olympics, and from that disgraceful incident with her friend and fellow skater,Nancy Kerrigan, to her last chance at the 1994 Winter Olympics, Tonya has always been a victim of her abundant talent. However, talent alone isn't enough, even for the first American figure skater who can perform to perfection the notoriously challenging triple axel in competition.—Nick Riganas In 1991, talented figure skaterTonya Hardingbecomes the first American woman to complete a triple axel during a competition. In 1994, her world comes crashing down when her ex-husband conspires to injure Nancy Kerrigan, a fellow Olympic hopeful, in a poorly-conceived attack that forces the young woman to withdraw from the national championship. Harding's life and legacy instantly become tarnished as she's forever associated with one of the most infamous scandals in sports history.—Jwelch5742 Growing up with an alcoholic, abusive mother, poor, and on the wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Oregon, Tonya Harding would never be accepted when it came to the world of figure skating. Although Tonya was a figure-skating prodigy, beginning her career at age four and winning competitions against competitors twice her age, she lacked the grace, beauty, and lifestyle of what had become known worldwide as the image of a ladies' competitive figure skater. This didn't stop Tonya, however. With the help of Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest coach, Tonya overcame many obstacles and began to make a name for herself in this cut-throat world of skating. Tonya became a national champion, a world medalist, and a member of the US Olympic team twice; she also made history by being the first-ever American woman to land a triple axel in competition. Her alcoholic mother LaVona worked as a waitress to pay for Tonya's coaching, but was horribly abusive and demeaning to Tonya despite her success. Around age 15, Tonya met her future husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, her future ""bodyguard"" Shawn Eckardt. Young, rebellious, and in love, Tonya marries Jeff, who later becomes physically and mentally abusive. Despite Tonya's successes, she is probably most famously known for the 1994 attack on fellow figure-skater and Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan. Following the attack, an investigation began and quickly concluded that Jeff Gillooly and Shawn Eckardt were at the center of it. This led to the unveiling of Tonya's involvement in the attack, as many had suspected. Tonya's involvement, regardless of how large or small, resulted in her being banned from the world of competitive figure skating. This movie shows Tonya's life from the beginning of her career in childhood through the end of her career and what followed. Based on actual interviews with Tonya, LaVona, Jeff, Shawn, Diane, and others from that time frame, the viewers get an inside look at her life, issues, relationships and point of view on the attack. I was afraid to watch it since I was a fascinated teen when this took place and figured it would be an exaggerated version of the truth. However, this is tastefully done.—Carrie DeCosta The film is based on ""mostly true, wildly contradictory"" actual interviews from the people represented in the film.It starts with overlapping faux interviews from Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), her mother LaVona (Allison Janney), Tonya's first coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson), her ex-bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser), and Hard Copy reporter Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale). All of them discuss how Tonya came to be in the figure-skating world and what kind of reputation she earned during and after her career.As a child, Tonya (here played by Mckenna Grace) is pushed by LaVona to join a figure-skating class taught by Diane starting at the age of four due to Tonya's obsession with it. Although Diane says she doesn't teach beginners, she becomes convinced after seeing Tonya on the ice. However, LaVona is verbally and physically abusive toward her daughter, claiming that this is what pushed Tonya to be as great as she was. Tonya was closer to her father Al (Jason Davis), as he taught her to hunt, and Tonya was devastated when he left her and LaVona.Tonya meets Jeff at the age of 15. They go on their first date with LaVona accompanying them. They fall in love, but Jeff proves to be just as abusive as LaVona, frequently striking Tonya on a whim. Still, Tonya decides to stay with him in the hopes that things will get better.In 1986, Tonya competes at Skate America in Portland, ME. She puts on a strong performance but it annoyed that the judges do not present her with her scores.At home, Tonya has dinner with LaVona. They argue about Jeff, which leads to a physical confrontation that ends with LaVona throwing a knife into Tonya's arm, leaving them both stunned and silent.Jeff helps Tonya make her own outfit for her next competition, and she knows it's not nearly as flashy as the outfits the other skaters wear. During her next competition, Tonya once again becomes angry that the judges won't present her scores. She confronts the judges in front of the audience, to which one of the judges coldly tells her she might not be as good as she thinks and that she should pick a different sport. Tonya responds with, ""Suck my dick!"" She goes to the back where Diane meets her, and Tonya fires her, saying she's moving to another coach.Tonya and Jeff eventually get married, which she acknowledges to have been a dumb thing she because she was young. LaVona shows up and naturally criticizes Tonya for marrying Jeff.At the 1991 Nationals in Minneapolis, MN, Tonya steps out with her new coach, Dody Teachman (Bojana Novakovic). A heckler attempts to bring Tonya's spirit down, but Dody encourages her. We then see that LaVona paid the heckler to taunt Tonya to motivate her. Here, Tonya becomes the first American woman to successfully pull off a triple axel, to the astonishment of everyone watching. Tonya says this was the moment she knew she was the best figure skater in the world at one point in time, and it makes her emotional.Both Tonya and Jeff claim that after the triple, everything changed for them. Jeff became even more abusive, and Tonya would maintain her focus on skating to the point that she leaves Jeff. She chimes in at one point to establish that she and Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) were friends and that they would hang out in between competitions.Tonya reconciles with Jeff, but she feels that her skating got worse after this. She continuously stumbles on the ice, but Tonya perseveres and knows she can do better.At the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France, Tonya places fourth behind Nancy after messing up most of her landings, which she blames on her skate blade being replaced poorly after it broke a few days earlier. Flashbacks indicate that her weight gain due to constant drinking was also a factor in her loss.Tonya and Jeff's relationship gets so bad that Tonya starts to file restraining orders until she finally divorces him. Jeff is left alone and remorseful. He eventually finds Tonya in her new home and pulls out a gun, threatening to shoot either her or himself. She runs out of the house, and Jeff fires a shot that ricochets off his truck and hits Tonya above the eye. Jeff tries to drive her to the hospital, but they are pulled over by a cop, and the cop busts Jeff for carrying guns and open booze bottles, but he never notices the wound on Tonya's face.Tonya starts working at a restaurant to make ends meet. When she goes outside for a smoke, she is found by Diane. She tells Tonya that the next Olympics will be in two years instead of four. Tonya starts training again under Diane to lose weight and build muscle in order for her to compete.Tonya later speaks to a skating official and acknowledges that he and the other head honchos don't like her, to which he responds that she just doesn't represent a wholesome image that they want to convey. This leads Tonya to go speak to LaVona at the restaurant where she works, as she believes LaVona cursed her, though she tells Tonya that she made her a winner.Everyone in the interviews now come to talk about ""the incident"" (Nancy getting her knee whacked by an assailant). Jeff states that there were many contradictory stories, including people claiming that Tonya herself had attacked Nancy.It begins in 1993 at the NW Regional Championships in Portland, OR. A cop comes to tell Tonya and Jeff that someone called in a death threat against Tonya, saying she will get ""a bullet in the back"" if she competes. In retaliation, Jeff goes to Shawn to try and send phony death threats to Tonya's competition to scare them. Shawn recruits two of his pals, Derrick Smith (Anthony Reynolds) and Shane Stant (Ricky Russert), to go out to Massachusetts where Nancy trains to try and scare her. Tonya herself is aware of the death-threats scare plan. However, Jeff eventually tries to get Shawn to call off the plan, but Shawn thinks they are too far in to call it off.Shane finds Nancy in Detroit at the rink and spots her in the hallway. He takes out a retractable baton and whacks her knee before trying to escape with Derrick serving as the getaway driver. The doors are locked, so he bashes his head through the glass to get away. Tonya and Jeff see the news on TV themselves with Nancy injured and crying in agony. Jeff angrily confronts Shawn for going ahead with the assault, where Shawn also admits that he had called in the death threat to Tonya before. Shane is eventually found by police and is arrested.Later on, Tonya qualifies to go to the Olympics. She and Jeff are found by FBI agents and questioned in regards to the incident. They claim to not know anything or to not have witnessed anything themselves. Jeff questions Shawn over how the authorities know the name Derrick. Although Shawn denies saying anything, flashbacks over the last 24 hours show that Shawn stupidly told a few people about Derrick, Shane, and most of their plan. Fourty-eight hours after that, the same agents that questioned Tonya and Jeff go to Shawn's house to question him, and he pins the blame entirely on Jeff. They attempt to set Jeff up in a sting operation to confess, but he never gives anything up.Tonya continues to compete while Jeff, Shawn, Derrick, and Shane are arrested and brought to trial. The press continues to hound Tonya's home, as well as LaVona's. She goes to visit Tonya with the press right behind her. Although Tonya tries to find support and consolation in her mother, LaVona tries to secretly record a confession from Tonya, which she finds out about and sends LaVona out of the house. With the constant threat of arrest and getting kicked out of competitions looming, Tonya remains firm that she knew nothing about the planned attack, while Jeff and the other guys try to say that she did know something.Tonya goes to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Tonya's skate lace messes up, causing her to cry from the pain. She places eighth, while Nancy places second and wins a silver medal behind Oksana Baiul from the Ukraine who wins the gold.Tonya officially goes to trial following the Olympics. As a result of her hindering the prosecution, she is sentenced to three years probation, a huge fine, 500 hours community service, a psychological evaluation, and she is banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life. This hurts Tonya the most, and she pleads with the judge to serve jail time instead, but his decision is made up.Through the interviews, Jeff states that he was sentenced to 18 months in prison but served only eight before being paroled. LaVona mentions that she has lost contact with Tonya, and that she couldn't care less, though it's clear that she feels the opposite. Jeff defends Tonya and says she never would have come up with the death threats, and that he feels responsible for ruining her career.Tonya later competes as a boxer to maintain some kind of career and to stay in the public eye. We see her competing and fighting brutally against her opponent. She reflects on her skating career and how the American public wants someone to love and hate, and how people always ask her to tell the truth. Tonya ends with stating that this is the story of her life, and ""that's the fucking truth.""The final text states that Tonya Harding and LaVona Golden have had no contact in several years. Last Tonya heard, LaVona was living in Washington state behind a porn shop. Jeff Gillooly changed his name to Jeff Stone, and he married a woman named Nancy. The two opened up a hair/tanning salon, and he works as a car salesman, happily married with two children. Tonya quit boxing and worked in landscaping, deck building, and house painting. She is happily married with a son and wants everyone to know she's a good mother.The credits show footage of the real Tonya Harding figure skating on the ice."
Hostiles,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5478478/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1892, a legendary Army Captain reluctantly agrees to escort a Cheyenne chief and his family through dangerous territory. In 1892 after nearly two decades of fighting the Cheyenne, the Apache, and the Comanche natives, the United States Cavalry Captain and war hero Joseph Blocker is ordered to escort the ailing Cheyenne chief, Yellow Hawk--his most despised enemy--to his ancestral home in Montana's Valley of the Bears. Nauseated with a baleful anger, Joseph's unwelcome final assignment is further complicated when widowed settler Rosalie Quaid is taken in by his band of soldiers. Aggressive packs of marauding Comanches are still on the warpath and thirsty for blood, so can the seasoned Captain do his duty one last time?—Nick Riganas In 1892, settler Rosalee Quaid and her family are attacked by a Comanche war group who kill and scalp her husband and also shoot and kill her three children. Only Rosalee manages to escape the attack by hiding in a small rock outcrop in the forest. In Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Captain Joseph Blocker rounds up an escaping Apache family and brings them back to the fort. He is then called to the office of Colonel Abraham Biggs, who informs him of his final orders before retirement. On a directive from President Harrison, he is to escort dying Cheyenne war chief, Yellow Hawk, and four members of his family back to their tribal lands in Montana. Under threat of a court-martial and loss of his pension, Blocker reluctantly accepts, despite his own gory history with the chief, who was responsible for the death of several of his friends and comrades. Blocker chooses the detail that will accompany him: his trusty old friend, First Sergeant Thomas Metz, long-time aide Corporal Woodson, and promising newcomer Lieutenant Kidder, fresh from West Point. Biggs also assigns to the detail a young French-speaking recruit, Private DeJardin. US Cavalry captain Joseph J. Blocker is about to retire in 1892 after a career of protecting Wild West pioneer families by fighting Indian 'savages' from various tribes. Under a presidential order, regimental colonel Abraham Biggs must force him to lead a patrol to return long-imprisoned, terminally-ill Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk and his four relatives from Fort Berringer, New Mexico, to their Montana native land, the Valley of the Bears, as a 'humanitarian gesture'. Joe's hatred for Indians and cruelty to his charges are kindled as they pass a burnt homestead and take along fresh widow Rosalee Quaid, helping to bury her children. But on the long way, they must pull together to fight off Apache and Comacnhe war parties, where the Cheyenne warrior skills prove invaluable and they manage to bond with Rosalie, while cavalry man fall, including gentle recruit private Philippe DeJardin and one of Joe's old comrades in arms. On the way Rosalie declines settling with commanding lieutenant colonel Ross McCowan's family in a garrison but Joe accepts to deliver to his murder trial a comrade gone rogue, who proves most troublesome. At arrival, Joe's loyalties have shifted and he deals with the illegally hostile reception of the local rancher.—KGF Vissers In 1892, a Comanche war party descends on the homestead of Wesley Quaid and his family. Quaid (Scott Shepherd) is killed, as his wife and three children attempt to escape. All three children are hit and killed by gunfire as the family runs away. Quaid's wife, Rosalie (Rosamund Pike), runs into the woods and hides, still holding onto the youngest child, a baby, who is dead. The Comanches search briefly for her, but fail to find her.In nearby Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Captain Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale) and his men captures an escaped Apache family and brings them back to the fort. Later he has a drink with old friend Master Sergeant Thomas Metz (Rory Cochrane). Metz is weary from his long years of service and says he is done soldiering. He has had his guns taken from him after a diagnosis of ""melancholia."" The men recount battles they have fought and friends they have lost.In the morning, Captain Blocker is called to the office of Colonel Abraham Biggs (Stephen Lang). Biggs informs Blocker that the President has ordered that Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi), who is dying from cancer, and his family be released so that they can return to their ancestral lands, Valley of the Bears, in Montana. Captain Blocker is told that it will be his duty to escort them and make sure that they get there safely. Initially, Blocker refuses the Colonel's order, even when faced with a court-martial, recounting terrible things that he has personally witnessed Yellow Hawk do. Blocker also exchanges words with Jeremiah Wilks (Bill Camp), an East Coast journalist who is also in the room, when Wilks points out that the Captain has also done some horrible things to natives. The Colonel warns Captain Blocker, who is set to retire, that his pension is at risk if he refuses his duty, and so Blocker reluctantly agrees. He is given papers signed by President Benjamin Harrison that will guarantee safe passage.Block sets out with a party that consists of Chief Yellow Hawk and his family (his grown son Black Hawk, Black Hawk's wife Elk Woman, Yellow Hawk's daughter Living Woman, as well as Black Hawk's young son Little Bear) and a small band of soldiers: Corporal Woodson (a Buffalo Soldier), Lieutenant Kidder (a West Point graduate), Master Sergeant Metz (who gets his guns back) , and Private Philippe DeJardin (a young Frenchman).The party sets out from Fort Berringer. Once away from the fort, Captain Blocker stops their progress and gets down off his horse with a knife in hand. One of his fellow soldiers hands him a second knife. Blocker orders Yellow Hawk to come down off his horse in his native tongue. Yellow Hawk complies, and Blocker offers the old man one of the knives. The Chief refuses the offered knife. Blocker then orders that the Chief and his son be put in chains for the duration of the trip and he orders the women's braids be untied.Further on their journey, the group comes across the burned-out home of the Quaid family. Blocker, Metz, and Woodson leave the group behind to investigate. They see Quaid's body still lying in the spot where he was killed and scalped. Inside the house, they find Rosalie, still holding her dead infant and sitting near a bed where her daughters are lying covered by blankets, also clearly dead. She warns the soldiers to be quiet because the children are ""sleeping.""Blocker and his soldiers go along with it, taking the ""sleeping"" children and her husband back to the group. Blocker tells some of his men to get shovels to dig a hole, and to get Rosalie a clean blanket for her infant. She gets angry when one of the soldiers approaches her, telling him not to touch her child. She seems to come to terms with the fact that her children are, in fact, dead; however, she insists that she will dig her family's graves. She attempts to do so, starting by hand, but fails. She allows the soldiers to dig the graves instead and makes Blocker promise to bury her with her family. After the camp is asleep Rosalie steals a pistol and goes out to the grave site but Blocker follows and takes away the pistol.Later that night, one of the native women offers Rosalie clean clothes, them being covered in the child's blood, saying she would be honored if Rosalie would wear them. Rosalie accepts. Meanwhile, Captain Blocker is warned by Yellow Hawk and his son that the Comanche will keep following them and that they are all in danger because the Comanche will not discriminate between the white men and the natives. They want Blocker to unchain them so that they can help defend the group if they are attacked, but Blocker refuses.The next day the group are attacked by the Comanche. During the battle Private DeJardin is killed and Corporal Woodson is badly wounded. The Cheyenne men help during the battle, riding over an attacker and Black Hawk chokes one with his chains. The Comanche who haven't been killed in the battle ride off. The group watches as Rosalie picks up a pistol and repeatedly shoots a dead Comanche until the pistol runs out of bullets.After making camp that night, Blocker orders the native men's chains to be taken off. During the night Master Sergeant Metz relieves Lieutenant Kidder of guard duty. The two men talk briefly. Kidder says that the Comanche he killed in battle was the first man he had ever killed. Metz recounts the first time he killed a man, at 14 years of age when he was fighting for ""the Grays"" (a.k.a. the Confederate Army). He says that after killing for a while, it gets easier and doesn't mean anything. Kidder says that that's what he's afraid of.The next day the group comes upon the remaining three Comanches, who have been slaughtered. Captain Blocker deduces that it was Yellow Hawk and Black Hawk, who must have slipped out of camp in the night and tracked them down and murdered them. He is upset with Metz for allowing them to slip away.The group arrives at an army Fort in Colorado, where the wounded Woodson is turned over for medical treatment. Blocker and Rosalie have dinner at the home of Lieutenant Colonel McGowan and his wife, Minnie. Mrs. McGowan, apparently unaware of what has happened to Rosalie, goes on about the poor treatment of natives by white men. Her husband angrily quiets her. Blocker asks McGowan if Rosalie can stay with them until she can find passage to wherever she may wish to go. McGowan agrees but lets them know that the stage isn't running and Rosalie may have to stay with them until Christmas, as there will be no one traveling through until then. McGowan asks Blocker to do him a favor. He would like for Blocker to make a stop along the way to drop off disgraced Sgt. Charles Wills at his home base. Wills has killed a family with an ax and is being returned to be hanged for murder. Blocker agrees but doesn't know the Sergeant's name.In the morning, Captain Blocker visits a recovering Corporal Woodson. Woodson is upset because he thinks he has let Blocker down, but Blocker assures him that he has never let anyone down, and tells him that is father would be proud of him. They say goodbye for what they acknowledge will likely be the last time.As the party gets ready to leave, with the condemned Sgt. Wills and two news escorts, Corporal Thomas and Sergeant Malloy, in tow, Rosalie asks Blocker if she can continue with him instead of staying in Colorado. He agrees. Rosalie, having been supplied with fresh clothes gives Elk Woman back the clothes she had been offered shortly after joining the group. Sargeant Wills and Blocker recognize each other before they ride out.Later, the group makes camp for the night. Wills is chained to a tree. He talks with Blocker and recalls that Blocker did many things that he could easily have been punished for. Later, Rosalie and the two native women are kidnapped by a group of fur traders who come across them as they wash dishes at a creek. Alerted by Little Bear, Blocker and several of his men, as well as Yellow Hawk and Black Hawk, track them down. They find the fur traders' camp and witness one of the kidnappers beating Yellow Hawk's daughter. When the kidnappers return to their tents, the men sneak down into the camp and attack the kidnappers in their tents and kill them. One of the rescuers is killed in the struggle.Later, Rosalie convinces Blocker to sleep in his tent which she has been occupying during a downpour. Metz intrudes on the conversation and Blockers talks with him. Metz expresses that he is leaving, after which he goes to Yellow Hawk's tent, offering the man some tobacco as a gesture of redemption. Still later, Wills, who has been left out in the rain, feigns a coughing fit to coax Lieutenant Kidder into unchaining him. Wills attacks Kidder, eventually getting control of his pistol and shooting him dead. The gunshot awakens the camp, and Blocker shoots Wills as the man escapes on a horse. Metz jumps on a horse and gives chase. In the morning the group finds the two men's bodies. Metz has a bullet to the head and is holding the bloody gun. The group bury Metz but Blocker refuses to bury Wills.As the group finally reaches Montana, Blocker and Yellow Hawk, who is near death from the cancer, speak. Blocker names some of the men he had lost fighting Yellow Hawk. Yellow Hawk responds by saying that he had also lost people. The two men shake hands in an apparent mutual act of forgiveness and friendship.When they arrive at Valley of the Bears, they bury the now dead Yellow Hawk using a traditional native burial scaffold. An older man and three younger men arrive on horse. The older man informs Blocker that he owns the land they are on and that the younger men are his sons. He says that he wants Blocker and his party to all leave, and to take Yellow Hawk's body with them. Blocker attempts to show him the papers signed by the President, but the man is uninterested and gives a dire warning. Rosalie points a rifle at the old man. The man says that he doesn't think she has what it takes to pull the trigger, at which point she shoots and kills him. The man's sons, the soldiers and Black Hawk exchange fire. In the firefight Black Hawk, Elk Woman and Living Woman are all killed, as is Corporal Thomas. Two of the younger assailants are also dead, but one tries to limp away. Blocker shots him in the back and then walks up to him and uses a knife to dispatch him.Later, Blocker, Rosalie, and Little Bear stand on a train platform all dressed in new civilian clothes. Rosalie is set to board a train to Chicago, taking Little Bear, now an orphan, with her. She says goodbye to Blocker, tells him he is a good man, and boards the train with the young boy. Blocker begins to walk away, but turns back and, after some consideration, steps aboard the train as it leaves the station."

In a qualifying event for the 2002 Winter Olympics, Molly is severely injured; ending her career.
Instead of her original plan of attending law school, Molly decides to take a year off and move to Los Angeles. Once she arrives, she becomes a bottle-service waitress at a club, where she meets Dean (Jeremy Strong), an ostentatious but unsuccessful real estate developer. She becomes his office manager, and he soon involves her in running his underground poker games. Many famous and wealthy individuals, such as movie stars, investment bankers, and sports players are involved in Dean's game; she earns large sums of money on tips alone.Molly is initially uninformed on poker topics, but quickly learns how to appeal to the players to gain tips. In particular, she hopes to please the most successful player, Player X (Michael Cera) (a composite character of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Ben Affleck, and other real-life celebrity poker players), by attracting new players to the game. Dean, upon seeing that Molly is becoming increasingly independent in running the games, attempts to control her, and then fires her. Molly, having gained the contacts through 8 years of running the game in LA, decides to create her own poker games. She rents a penthouse at a hotel, and hires a staff to help her run games. Additionally, she contacts employees at clubs and casinos to try and spread word about her poker games. Player X, along with many other players, decide to leave Dean's games to play for Molly. Molly becomes increasingly successful, gaining more money while being pressured to raise the stakes for her games. Harlan Eustice (Bill Camp), a conservative gambler who becomes increasingly compulsive, joins her game. Despite heavy losses (Harlan continues to make bigger and bigger bets for 48 hrs straight until he is down 1.2 MM USD. Harlan had a reputation for winning, so when the word spread that Harlan is on the tilt, they came from all over LA to beat Harlan and recoup some of their money), Eustice continues to play; Molly finds out that Player X has been funding his losses to keep him in the game. After Molly berates him for his unethical actions, Player X decides to change to Dean's game, where the other players join him; Molly is left without any players for her poker games.Molly moves to New York, with the hope of beginning a new underground poker game. After reaching out to many wealthy New Yorkers, Molly finds enough players for several weekly games. Despite continuous success, she is unable to cover her losses when players cannot pay. Her dealer convinces her to begin taking a percentage of large pots, allowing her to recuperate her potential losses (but which also means that she is in violation of the law by running an illegal casino). One of her Los Angeles players is indicted for running a Ponzi scheme; Molly is investigated and questioned as to who attended her games. At this time, Molly becomes increasingly addicted to drugs as the games have increasingly taken their toll. Her players also begin to include wealthy individuals from the Russian mafia, among others. She is approached by several Italian mafia members, who offer their services to extort money from non-paying players. After she declines, she is attacked in her home, where she is held at gunpoint and her mother's life is threatened. As she is about to return to her poker games, the FBI conducts a raid, a result of Douglas Downey (Chris O'Dowd), one of her players (The one who introduced Molly to the Russian mafia in the first place), acting as an informant. Molly's assets are seized, and she returns home to live with her mother.Two years later, Molly has published a book where she names few individuals that played in her games, and has recently moved out. She is arrested by the FBI, and indicted for involvement in illegal gambling with the mafia. She enlists the help of Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), a high-profile and expensive lawyer in New York, who agrees to help after Molly claims she has over $2 million in unclaimed gambling debts. After listening to Molly's full story he is convinced that she had nothing to do with the Russian or Italian mafia and her only crime was to run an illegal gambling joint for 7 months, which she stopped 2 yrs ago. Every penny that she had earned was legit (Even the 4 MM USD that the DoJ confiscated while arresting her). After she gave up gambling, she wrote a book and had a golden shot to earn millions by naming everyone that she was ever associated with, but refused to do so and accepted a meager dollars 35000 as a deposit on her book, in which she names only those 4 individuals that were named in the Harlan investigation by him.While in New York awaiting trial, Molly's father, Larry, seeks her out, and attempts to reconcile with her. He admits that he was overbearing, and that he treated Molly differently than her brothers because she had known about his affairs. Charlie reads Molly's book, and becomes interested in helping her case, as he feels she has not committed serious enough wrongdoing to merit a prison term. Charlie negotiates a deal for Molly to receive no sentence and her money returned in exchange for her hard drives and digital records from gambling. Molly declines this deal, fearing for the information about her players that would be released, and pleads guilty. The judge, arguing that she had committed no serious crimes, sentences her to community service, probation, and a $200,000 fine."

When Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) gets fired, he convinces his brother Clyde (Adam Driver) and sister Mellie (Riley Keough) to help him rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway during a NASCAR Race. But they will need the help of Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), a convicted safe-cracker who is currently doing time. All they have to do is break Joe out, blow the racetrack vault, get away with the cash, return Joe to prison, and get Jimmy to his daughter's beauty pageant on time. What could possibly go wrong? Well, there is the Logan family curse .—Cinemaniacal Jimmy Logan is laid off from his construction job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. While visiting his ex-wife Bobbie Jo to pick up their daughter Sadie for a beauty pageant rehearsal, he learns that Bobbie Jo and her new husband are moving to Lynchburg, making it even harder for Jimmy to visit. Jimmy goes to a bar, run by his brother Clyde, an Iraq War veteran who lost his hand during the war. Max Chilblain, a pretentious British businessman and NASCAR-team owner, arrives with his friends and insults Clyde, leading to a fight with Jimmy. Meanwhile, Clyde sets fire to Max's car with a Molotov cocktail. On his way out, Jimmy yells ""cauliflower,"" which Clyde recognizes as a code-word they used when they committed crimes as young boys. Next day, Jimmy reveals his plan to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of their pneumatic tube system for moving money.. Boone County, West VirginiaJimmy Logan (Channing Tatum) is with his daughter Sadie (Farrah Mackenzie) talking about his favorite song, John Denver's ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" and its importance in culture. Sadie doesn't think it will work for her upcoming pageant. Jimmy then kisses Sadie goodbye as he heads for work in Charlotte, North Carolina, promising her he will make it back in time for the pageant.Jimmy goes through his shift in the tunnels beneath the Motor Speedway, only to return to work for his boss Cal (Jim O'Heir) to fire him due to potentially being a liability. This is a result of Jimmy injuring his leg during his former run as a football player.To make things worse, Jimmy finds out from his sister Mellie (Riley Keough) that Sadie's pageant had been the previous day, not the current day as Jimmy thought. Jimmy goes to talk to his ex-wife Bobbie Jo (Katie Holmes), who is very much upset about this, but Sadie is more forgiving. However, Jimmy learns from Bobbie Jo that she and her new husband Moody (David Denman) plan to move with Sadie and their other two sons to Lynchburg where it would be harder for Jimmy to visit.Jimmy later goes to a bar run by his brother Clyde (Adam Driver), a former Iraq veteran who lost his arm and now wears a prosthetic. Jimmy complains to Clyde about his woes, discussing what they think is a Logan family curse. Soon, Max Chilblain (Seth MacFarlane), a snooty British sports drink salesman, enters with two of his buddies. Clyde serves them without his prosthetic, which Max finds impressive. He makes a few snide remarks in regards to his disability, leading Jimmy to attack Max and the other two. Clyde steps outside in the middle of this to go chuck a Molotov cocktail at Max's truck. Jimmy puts out the fire and yells ""Cauliflower"" to Clyde before leaving.The next day, the brothers meet over ""cauliflower"", as Clyde remembers it from back in the day when he and Jimmy would commit petty crimes. Jimmy pitches an idea to Clyde - they rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Jimmy knows how the money goes through the tunnels and that security won't be so tight on the day of the big race. Clyde agrees, and they get Mellie onboard as well.Jimmy and Clyde go to prison to meet with Joe Bang (Daniel Craig), a convicted criminal/demolitions expert. The brothers tell him their plan, which he laughs at, but they assure him they can get him in and out of prison without anyone realizing. Joe tells them he wants to bring in his dim-witted younger brothers Fish and Sam (Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson). Jimmy and Clyde approach them and recruit them as well.In order to help Joe get out, Clyde gets himself arrested by crashing a car through a shop window, getting a 90-day sentence. Meanwhile, Mellie and the Bang brothers send food with roaches into the Speedway's main vault so it can be measured while everyone is cleared out.Jimmy goes to gather supplies. He is spotted by Sylvia Harrison (Katherine Waterston), a girl from school that recognizes him. She mentions that she runs a mobile clinic, and she gives Jimmy a shot. Before Sylvia leaves, Jimmy asks her if they kissed in school. She is displeased with the question and she leaves.Jimmy bumps into Cal, who wants to make sure there are no hard feelings. Cal also mentions that they finished construction ahead of schedule, meaning the heist must get moved up a week during a big race on Memorial Day weekend.In prison, Clyde and Joe get the prisoners to stage a riot so that they can get out unnoticed. They crawl out through the vents and are met by Mellie, who picks the up and takes them to the Speedway. Warden Burns (Dwight Yoakam) is forced to handle the situation, despite there being no actual problem (other than two prisoners escaping).The gang initiates the heist with Fish and Sam cutting off the Speedway's electrical grid so that vendors may only do cash transactions. Jimmy, Clyde, and Joe head down to the pipes where the money goes through so that they can use one of Joe's homemade bombs to stuff through the hole. The brothers are confused when Joe says he used gummy bears as part of the bomb, then stops the heist to give them a chemistry lesson on how an ingredient in the gummies mixed with the other materials creates an explosive reaction. They stuff the container with the bomb through the pipe, only for it to shoot back and hit Clyde in the chest. It thankfully doesn't go off because Joe realizes he tightened the bag too much. He loosens it and it explodes when it's sent back.The smoke goes through the pipes and is noticed by the Speedway staff. Security goes to investigate but are thrown off when others they speak to say they didn't hear anything or smell anything. The gang then continues with taking the money through a vacuum. Jimmy tries to get it to speed the process, which only sends money flying everywhere. He hits the reverse button, causing the vacuum to suck up Clyde's arm. Things get heated when it's slipped that Jimmy was the one originally supposed to go to Iraq, but he somehow made it so that Clyde would end up going.The gang takes the money in garbage bags and slip out. Clyde and Joe are spotted by Max and his sponsored driver Dayton White (Sebastian Stan). Another altercation occurs in which Max gets a broken nose. The two return to prison with nobody having suspected a thing.Jimmy makes it on time for Sadie's next pageant. Instead of performing Rihanna's ""Umbrella"" like she planned, she sings ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" as soon as she sees Jimmy walk in, leading the whole audience to sing along.It is later heard on the news that the money stolen from the Speedway was recovered by authorities after Jimmy left the truck at a gas station and tipped them off for them to find it. Mellie doesn't want to see Jimmy when she hears the news.Soon, FBI Agent Sarah Grayson (Hilary Swank) sets out to investigate the robbery. She first visits Warden Burns, who couldn't provide much help as he was handling the ""riot"". Grayson then visits Max in the hospital, but his account of seeing Clyde doesn't match with what Dayton told them (the two had a falling out). Eventually, with no evidence or credible witnesses, the case is shut down.Clyde and Joe are released from prison. Joe goes home and finds some of the money hidden in his yard.A while later, Jimmy goes to the bar with his new girlfriend, Sylvia. He tells Clyde (who has a new prosthetic arm) that he split up shares of the money for the gang, as well as for the authorities to find to throw them off their trail. Clyde then serves Grayson, who is continuing her investigation undercover. The rest of the gang drink among each other. The last thing we see is Clyde's old arm clutching a beer bottle."

Alice is also attempting to start her own interior design business. While out for a drink with her friends, Alice encounters Harry, George and Teddy, three aspiring filmmakers in LA to make a pitch to possible producers after a short film they presented at a film festival received positive acclaim.. Budding New York director Harry, script writer George and actor Teddy move to L.A. when a Hollywood studio finally promises to produce a feature version of their festival award-winning short film. Their lack of living accommodation is solved when slick womanizer Harry's latest bar conquest, interior decorator Alice Kinney, 'helped' by her ex-actress mother, invites him and soon his mates to move in with her in the splendid villa of her grandfather, legendary director Alice Kinney, and get on great with Alice's brat daughters Isabel and Rosie. Alice's separated husband, music producer Austen, suddenly waves his objections to leaving L.A. when he smells competition, and returns uninvited 'for the girls', actually to oust Harry.—KGF Vissers The film begins with a voice-over from Alice Kinney (Reese Witherspoon) detailing her life until age 40. Her father was a famous filmmaker who fell in love with his lead actress, Lillian Stewart (Candice Bergen). After Alice was born, he had an affair, and the marriage ended. Alice married Austen (Michael Sheen) and had two kids, but they separated, and Alice has moved with her two daughters, Isabel and Rosie, from New York City into her father's old Los Angeles house. Alice is starting over, trying to get her interior design business off the ground.When we find Alice in the present day, it's her 40th birthday, and she's crying in her bathroom. Her daughters knock at the door, and Alice acts like nothing is wrong and takes them to their first day at their new school. Isabel, in particular, is nervous, but her mother assures her everything will be fine.Meanwhile, brothers Harry (Pico Alexander) and Teddy (Nat Wolff) and their friend George (Jon Rudnitsky) are being kicked out of the motel they've stayed in for a couple of weeks because they're out of money. Their short film was a hit on the festival circuit - Harry the director, George the writer, and Teddy the star - and they've come to Los Angeles to try to turn that success into a real film. Harry is aggressively confident and assures the other guys that they'll figure out a place to stay.The girls are staying with their grandmother that night, so Alice goes out with her friends to celebrate her birthday. Alice and her friends run into the guys, and they stay out all night dancing and getting hammered. Harry is extremely flirty with Alice, and they all end up back at Alice's - Harry and Alice make out, but Harry throws up from all the drinking and passes out.The next morning Alice is surprised she let so loose the night before. Harry is smitten with her, but she tells him that the night before was out of character for her and it's for the best that not much happened. Meanwhile, George gets up and discovers a room filled with all of Alice's father's film posters, scripts, and awards. Lillian, Isabel, and Rosie return, confused as to who these three young men are. George recognizes Lillian, and the guys become extremely excited and begin to flatter her with praise about her films. Alice is already late to an important job interview, so she tells the guys to see themselves out.Alice meets with Zoey Bell (Lake Bell), a very rich woman, in the hopes of getting hired to be her interior designer, but Zoey explains she already had most of the rooms done by a decorator she fired for creative differences. She offers Alice a job doing her daughter's room instead. Disappointed but hopeful it could turn into more, Alice accepts.Alice returns home and finds the boys haven't left, but instead have spent a delightful afternoon with Lillian talking about film. Lillian tells Alice that they have nowhere to stay and she should let them stay with her. Alice is incredulous and refuses, but Lillian says they're talented guys and she could help them on their way to greatness. She says Alice's father would have liked them. Alice begrudgingly agrees - she offers to let the guys stay in the guesthouse, but makes sure to tell Harry that nothing romantic can happen between them.The guys have a big meeting at an agency; they tell them a popular horror filmmaker named Justin Miller (Reid Scott) liked their short and wants to work with them. The guys are concerned since that isn't the genre they're going for but agree to take a meeting. Austen calls Alice, extremely concerned about the strange men living with his daughters. Alice wants to know if he cares about his daughters so much, when is he going to move to Los Angeles like he said he would. He insists it's going to be soon.When Zoey calls Alice to do a bunch of inane tasks for her, George drives Isabel to school one day. Isabel and George bond because Isabel is also a writer - she is thinking about entering a play writing workshop her teacher Miss Avery suggested her for, but she's too anxious to do it. Meanwhile, the agents call George and offer him a side job doing rewrites on another script. He hesitates because he knows Harry will see it as a betrayal, but the two of them agree to put their fears aside and go for the opportunities in front of them.Alice arrives home from a long day working for Zoey and finds Teddy has made dinner and Harry is screening one of her father's films in the backyard. After a lovely evening, Alice tells Harry she hadn't watched any of them in a while and thanks him. He stays up late fixing a kitchen cabinet, and after a lot of wine, they finally start sleeping together.Alice continues doing menial tasks for Zoey until she discovers Zoey simply hired back her old designer and didn't even consider her for the job. George helps Isabel write her play, she tells him she'll be too nervous to perform it, but he promises he'll be waiting there in the wings.Things go well for a while, and Alice invites Harry to come with her to her friend's dinner officially as her date. He tells her he'll meet her after drinks with Justin, but the drinks keep running longer and longer, and he misses it entirely. Alice is hurt, and when Harry comes home, she tells him that she's too old to be crying over a boy and that he's so young he's going to screw up because that's what guys his age do. She tells him their romantic relationship is over. He tries to change her mind, but she tells him she's already got a date set up with another man.Alice goes on her date, but it doesn't go well, so she drinks too much - and then Zoey shows up at the same restaurant. Alice charges over and tells her off and quits, but her date bails on her, and she ends up drunk laying on a bench outside the restaurant. George, who is starting to get real feelings for Alice, picks her up, and she tells him he's a good guy. When they arrive home, Austen is waiting with his bags. He's also going to stay at the house.The guys immediately do not like Austen; they think he's bad for Alice. Especially Harry, who keeps butting heads with Austen - who can tell something has been going on between him and Alice. Tensions begin to rise. Meanwhile, Harry sees that George has been writing something else on his laptop, and as predicted, feels like he's giving up on their movie. He also thinks George is jealous of his connection with Alice. When he finds out that Teddy is also auditioning for other projects, he storms out.Upset, Teddy confronts Austen about what he wants from Alice. Austen says he's going to get their marriage back together and reunite their family. Teddy says Alice doesn't want that, and Austen says Alice doesn't know what she wants. Teddy punches Austen in the face, and they begin fighting. George tries to break it up, but Alice and the girls arrive to see Teddy hitting Austen. Alice tells the boys they need to move out. They're devastated. Austen assumes they're going to get back together, but Alice tells him she's ready for a divorce, and she's sure.George and Teddy find Harry staying with Justin Miller, and they all apologize to each other. George and Teddy explain yes, they can do other projects, but the movie is still their priority. Time passes, and Alice continues working on her business, Isabel finishes her play, and Teddy gets a part on a TV show.Alice goes to visit the boys and their new apartment. Harry answers, and he assumes she and Austen are together now. She tells him that Austen is living in LA now, but has his own place. Harry is excited. The other boys arrive, and they all agree that they've missed each other a lot.The day of Isabel's play, the boys go with Justin to a meeting with Ryan, a big time producer who thinks he wants to get their movie made. But he keeps pushing it farther and farther until they're about to miss the play. When they finally get to the meeting, Ryan wants to make lots of changes that go against the boys' vision of the film. Harry tells him that if he doesn't want to make their movie, they need to go because they have a play to catch. He passionately tells Ryan that if he doesn't make their film, he's making a mistake, and the boys rush out to catch the play in time. The play begins, and Isabel steps out onto the stage. She freezes, extremely nervous - but George makes it to the wings (and has a flirtation with Miss Avery) just in time. Isabel sees him and remembers her words, and the play goes well.After the show, Alice, Austen, Lillian, the girls, and the three young guys all have dinner at her home and celebrate the success of the show. Alice smiles as she looks at her strange, happy family."

His grandfather,Jean Paul Getty(Christopher Plummer), is the richest human in the world, a billionaire oil magnate, but he's notoriously miserly. His favorite grandson's abduction is not reason enough for him to part with any of his fortune.All the Money in the World (2017)follows Gail, (Michelle Williams), Paul's devoted, strong-willed mother, who unlike Getty, has consistently chosen her children over his fortune. Her son's life in the balance with time running out, she attempts to sway Getty even as her son's mob captors become increasingly more determined, volatile and brutal. When Getty sends his enigmatic security man Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg) to look after his interests, he and Gail become unlikely allies in this race against time that ultimately reveals the true and lasting value of love over money..—Sony Pictures 1973. J Paul Getty is the wealthiest man in the world. His grandson, John Paul Getty III, is kidnapped in Italy and his kidnappers demand a ransom of USD 17m. Getty refuses to pay, as giving in to their demands will encourage the kidnapping of his grandchildren. Despite his wealth, he is rather miserly. It is up to the boy's mother to try to find a way to get her son back.—grantss As the film opens, John ""Paul"" Getty III (Charlie Plummer) is wandering the streets of Rome at night. He encounters some prostitutes, who notice that he's really young, so they encourage him to go back to his family, even though he insists that he's not a boy. As he's wandering away, a van pulls up alongside the streets where he's walking. Some men get out of the van and abduct Paul.The film flashes back a few years to Paul as a child. His mother, Gail (Michelle Williams), and father, John Paul Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are struggling to raise their children. John Jr. is estranged from his father, John Paul Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer), the richest man in the world, up to that point. Gail convinces John Jr. to reestablish contact with his father, which he does by writing a letter. Sometime later, John Jr. gets a telegram from his father, urging John Jr. to come to Rome for a new job opportunity. The whole family makes the trip and meets Getty Sr. at his hotel room, where they find clothes hanging in the bathroom. Getty Sr. tells the family that he prefers to dry his own clothes rather than to spend some money on having the hotel staff do it.The family moves to Rome where John Jr. begins working for the Getty Oil Company. Years later, this leads to John Jr. becoming addicted to drugs and sleeping with other women. Gail pursues a divorce from John Jr.As Gail deals with Getty Sr. over the divorce, Gail wants child support, but Getty Sr. does not want Gail to have anything since everything comes from his money. Gail negotiates and eventually decides to forget about the child support so that she can have the divorce.Cut to the present time.The kidnappers want $17 million in cash for Paul's safe return. They first call Gail, but she tells them that she doesn't have any money. They don't believe her since her last name is Getty, so naturally, they believe she is rich. The main kidnapper, Cinquanta (Romain Duris), convinces Gail to ask Getty Sr. for the money. After news of the kidnapping reaches Getty Sr. in a live TV interview, he publicly declares that he won't pay anything for Paul's safe return, rationalizing that if he were to do so, he would have 14 kidnapped grandchildren instead of just one.Gail leaves a message with Getty Sr.'s assistant, telling him that she's on her way to see him. After reading the message, Getty Sr. tells his assistant to call in Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg). Chace is Getty Sr.'s top advisor, who also used to work for the CIA. Gail goes to Getty's mansion and, while waiting, she meets Chace. Getty talks with Chace and tells him to find out what is happening with the kidnapping, but that Chace is not to pay anything for Paul's return.Gail and Chace begin to go over the details of the kidnapping. As weeks start to go by, the kidnappers begin to get anxious that the ransom is taking much longer than originally expected. The winter months start to arrive, and the compound where they are holding Paul is not fit for the cold. So, they contemplate moving him. Meanwhile, one day as Paul needs to go to the bathroom, one of the kidnappers takes him out to a grassy area outside. The kidnappers are supposed to shield their faces from Paul so that Paul cannot identify any of them. However, the kidnapper with Paul lifts his mask up, as Paul is a small distance away. But, the kidnapper forgets to put his mask back on fully, so Paul ends up seeing the kidnapper's face. As the kidnapper prepares to kill Paul, a gunshot is heard.Sometime later, Gail gets a call from the local authorities, telling her that they have found her son and asks her to come down and identify his dead body. At the morgue, Gail looks at the body and realizes that it is not Paul. Gail tells Chace that the body is that of an older man, later revealed to be the kidnapper whose face was seen by Paul. The kidnapper was killed because of his mistake. Chace has forensics done on the body, and the police find out that the dead kidnapper has had priors in the past. They also see a list of his known associates, which include Cinquanta. The local authorities track the kidnappers to the compound where they've been holding Paul. The authorities storm the base and kill three kidnappers. After looking throughout the building, they find out that Paul has been moved.Cinquanta has sold Paul to a local crime family. The new crime family relocates Paul to another compound. There, Paul creates a fire in a nearby brush by throwing a small lit piece of paper out the window of the room he's being held in. The kidnappers are celebrating in the compound, so as the fire burns, Paul uses an old piano to break through a boarded door in the back of the room he's in. Paul escapes as the kidnappers are distracted. Cinquanta sees Paul as he's escaping, but chooses not to tell the others, since he's come to care for Paul.Paul makes it to the road and flags down a car. The driver is a local police officer, who takes Paul to his home. There, Paul uses the phone to call his mother. Gail begins to talk to Paul, but before Paul can tell her where he's at, the kidnappers arrive to take Paul back. (It is unclear whether they just happened to find Paul or if the police officer tipped the kidnappers off to his location.)Since more weeks go by without the ransom being paid, the kidnappers decide to cut off Paul's right ear and mail it to a newspaper. Gail again tries to reason with Getty, which works. He agrees to give her the money, only if she signs off all ownership of her children to him. She gives in, but later on, Gail and Chace find out that Getty is only going to give them $1 million since that's the most that he can give and have it be tax-deductible. Chace continues to negotiate with Cinquanta.Chace goes to see Getty, where he angrily tells Getty that all of the security that Getty has is because of him (Chace) and that there's nothing that could stop Chace from harming Getty. Chace goes on to say that, despite, Getty having all the money in the world, he's still just a man. After this exchange, Getty has a change of heart and wires Gail the full amount of the ransom, which has been negotiated down to $4 million. He has also voided the contract with Gail, choosing for her to continue to have authority over the children.Gail and Chace follow the kidnappers' instructions on the money drop. They drive on a desolate road until a stone cracks their car's windshield, which is a sign to stop the vehicle. They get out and unload the suitcases containing the money onto the side of the road. Next, they are instructed to continue down the road until they reach a gas station, where they are to stop and wait at the pay phone for further instructions.After Gail and Chace take off towards the gas station, some men come out to get the money. At the gas station, Gail and Chace are told that Paul is waiting down the road for them. However, instead of waiting where he was dropped off, Paul takes off towards the nearest town. When Gail and Chace arrive, they don't see Paul, but they conclude he took off towards the town.At the kidnappers' hideout, they count the money, but helicopters soon arrive, and they deduce that Chace has betrayed them. The leader gives the order to find Paul and kill him. Paul goes through the empty, closed town, trying to get someone to help, but since it's night, all the shops are closed, and people are hesitant to help Paul when he appeals to them for help. Gail and Chace arrive at the town and begin looking for Paul. Soon after them, the kidnappers, along with Cinquanta, arrive at the town too.Chace spots Paul, but Paul runs away. Paul runs into one of the kidnappers, who almost kills Paul until Cinquanta knocks the man out and allows Paul to go. Gail and Chace get Paul out of the town, and they head back. As this is happening, Getty wakes up from sleep, sweating and rambling. He soon dies, staring at a painting he had recently bought for $1.5 million.Getty has left his entire fortune to his grandchildren, which leaves Gail as the executor of the estate. She proceeds to sell all of the various pieces of art that Getty had collected.An end title card states that most of the art Getty collected now resides in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles."
Gifted,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4481414/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Frank, a single man raising his child prodigy niece Mary, is drawn into a custody battle with his mother. Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy - his spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in a coastal town in Florida. Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well.—Fox Searchlight Pictures In a small town near Tampa, Florida, seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and DE FACTO guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for show-and-tell and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for gifted children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a normal childhood. Single Frank Adler, who works as a freelance boat repairman and lives in a trailer park on the Florida coast, has been guardian to his seven year old niece Mary Adler since she was a newborn after her mother, Frank's sister, Diane Adler, committed suicide. At the time, Frank was a Philosophy professor at Boston University, he moving with Mary in an effort to ""escape"". Like her mother, Mary is a math prodigy, of which Frank is well aware. Frank has home schooled Mary up until now in an effort to protect her from people like who he was escaping from, his and Diane's own mother, uncompromising (to use Frank's vernacular) Evelyn Adler, who, if she had custody, would have had a singular focus in the math prodigy aspect of Mary, much like she was with Diane. Frank, who has largely treated Mary like an equal in being up front with her about most things, has now decided to send Mary to a regular public school in an effort to socialize her to other children and to make her feel like a normal child, with their neighbor, adult Roberta Taylor, Mary's only real friend besides Frank. Roberta routinely sits with Mary to allow Frank his regular Friday out at the bar for himself. Although Frank cautions Mary about not being too ""obvious"" at school, Mary's teacher, Bonnie Stevenson, quickly discovers not only Mary's advanced math abilities, but her background being Diane's daughter. Although Miss Stevenson, like Frank, wants what's best holistically for Mary, the process to provide an advanced education to Mary at the expense of all else begins to snowball to the point where Evelyn learns of Frank and Mary's whereabouts. Not agreeing with any of Frank's choices, Evelyn sues for full custody, which brings into light the entire dynamic that existed and exists between Evelyn, Frank and Diane.—Huggo While living his carefree life as a boat repairman, Frank Adler is raising his seven year old niece Mary by himself in western Florida as her de facto guardian. While understanding her unbelievable mathematical abilities, he hopes she will be able to live a normal life, unlike his late sister and her late mother Diane. Frank enrolls Mary in public school as a first grader, despite her distaste for kids her own age. While there, the teacher learns of Mary's talents and requests that maybe Frank transfer her to a private school on a full ride. Frank declines, but begins seeing the teacher Bonnie outside of school. When Frank's mother Evelyn realizes what is going on, she hopes to move her to Boston and gain custody of her. During the custody battles, stories come to light of the relationship between Evelyn, Frank, and Diane. The case turns personal with no clear resolution in sight. In the morning of her first day at school, Mary (Mckenna Grace) is in a foul mood because she doesn't want to go. She wants Frank (Chris Evans) to continue homeschooling her, but he says he's taught her everything he knows, and she needs the experience. As soon as he sees the reluctant, sulking Mary off to school, he's confronted by Roberta (Octavia Spencer), who's his landlady and friend, and cares deeply for Mary. She tells him to get in his car and bring Mary back before it's too late, afraid that she will be taken away once everyone realizes she's a child prodigy. Frank tries to calm her down, saying Mary needs friends and social skills. Roberta isn't convinced, but there's nothing she can do, so she lets go.At school, Mary is shown bored out of her mind as Bonnie (Jenny Slate), her teacher, goes over first-grade math problems with the rest of the class. Mary eventually speaks up, making it known that the lack of challenge is beyond her ability to bear. Bonnie warns her for speaking out of turn and starts asking her increasingly difficult arithmetic problems to make a point. To her surprise, Mary answers them all. After recess, the Principal requests a walk-in observation of Bonnie's class. As soon as she introduces herself to the children, Mary demands to know if she's ""the boss"", and upon confirmation, demands that she call Frank right away and tell him to get her out of there. When Frank comes to pick Mary up, Bonnie catches up to him on the front yard and tells him she thinks Mary might be a gifted child. Frank chalks it off to some simple algorithm he's taught her and walks away before Bonnie can discuss the matter with him any further.Bonnie then does her own research and finds out that Mary's mom Diane was a Math genius, also, working on one of the Millennium Prize problems when she apparently took her own life and was survived by her brother Frank. She then confronts Frank at the bar she knows he hangs out on Friday nights and learns the back story. Diane, her sister, appeared at her doorstep out of the blue one night with Mary, who was just a baby at the time. She said she needed to talk to him but Frank, already late for a date, told her they'd talk when he got back. When he got back, Diane had committed suicide in the bathroom, and Mary was in his living room. He's been raising her since then.On the school bus one day, Mary witnesses bullying and she stands up for the victim, breaking the nose of the bully who's five years her senior. Frank is called to the Principal's office, where she tells him she can get a full ride for Mary at a nearby school for the gifted. Frank refuses the offer on the grounds that she wants Mary to have a normal childhood. The Principal then reaches out to Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), Frank's mother and Mary's grandmother.Evelyn shows up at Frank's door soon after and meets Mary for the first time. She's a rich, bossy Englishwoman whose ideas of life and ambition Frank clearly disagrees with. She criticizes Frank's lifestyle choices and demands to take Mary away with her to Boston. When Frank disagrees, she takes him to court.In the court hearings and over that period of time, we find out more about the friction between Evelyn and Frank. Evelyn is disappointed in her dead daughter for being too weak to complete the Millennium Prize problem, disappointed in Frank for having quit his professorship at Boston University, and resentful of her late husband for disrupting her successful career. She's also having problems with her current husband, and they are separated. Frank doesn't openly accuse of her anything but insists that Evelyn will deny Mary the normalcy a child needs in her life and that him being a freelance boat repairman is perfectly fine. Roberta stands by Frank throughout the ordeal, and his lawyer (Glenn Plummer) does a good job defending him. In the end, though, Evelyn wants to settle by putting Mary in foster care in proximity to Frank's house and making her go to the school for gifted children.Crushed under the guilt of not having stayed with Diane the night of her death, and his insecurity over his capability for raising Mary, he yields. Mary is absolutely furious, however, and refuses to see Frank after he's left her with the foster family despite her relentless begging and tears. Frank is desolate, but is determined to do what everyone seems to think is best for Mary, when he finds out thanks to Bonnie that the foster family has put Mary's beloved one-eyed cat up for adoption.He rushes to the animal shelter and rescues Mary's car and two other last minute before they are put down. He finds out from the front desk at the shelter that the cat was brought there due to allergy issues. Knowing it's Evelyn who's allergic to cats, he makes a quick stop at his place and then rushes to the foster family's home to confront Evelyn. As he suspected, she's in the guest house with Mary and two tutors. Upon seeing him, Mary runs away. Frank follows suit after throwing a file on the desk and tells Evelyn she must see it. Evelyn tries to go after them but Roberta physically blocks her way and stops her. Frank manages to catch up to Mary and ask for forgiveness. Mary stops fighting and hugs him, and her spirits get even more elevated as she finds out her cat is at Frank's place safe and sound.When Mary and Frank return to the guesthouse, Roberta takes Mary to the car, and Frank orders the tutors out. We find that it's the finished proof for the Millennium Prize problem Diane had been working on. Evelyn says she doesn't believe it because she would have shared it with the world. Frank tells her that Diane gave him clear instructions to wait to publish it until after their mother's death. He tells her that she can go ahead and publish it, and leave Mary alone. Since she asks, he tells Evelyn that if she refuses, he'll take the folder away and wait to publish it until after Evelyn dies. Evelyn is shocked and in tears, but she takes the deal.At the end, Mary is shown attending classes at the university in the mornings, and the elementary school in the afternoons. Bonnie and Frank smile at each other with affection."
Downsizing,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389072/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A social satire in which a man realizes he would have a better life if he were to shrink himself to five inches tall, allowing him to live in wealth and splendor. A new world of possibilities awaits, thanks to a revolutionary medical procedure known as Downsizing. Billed as environmentally-friendly, many people choose to downsize for economic benefits. When the kindly occupational therapist, Paul, undergoes the new procedure, finding himself in this brand-new existence, he must choose between a sheltered life or making an impact in his own small way. Can he help save the planet and afford a nice lifestyle at the same time? In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, a scientist invents ""downsizing"", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. Scientists have discovered a way to miniaturise life, including humans. This is seen as a solution to overpopulation and people start to voluntarily be 'downsized', forming communities of downsized people.

What is expensive to people of normal size is worth a fraction in Leisureland, meaning Laura was able to purchase diamond jewelry for a mere $83, which Jeff says is their food budget for two months. The audience seems more than convinced to go through with downsizing.The Safraneks receive a call that their mortgage application has been denied. After thinking it over and discussing with Leisureland officials, Paul and Audrey decide to go and get small. Their friends throw them a party for their decision.

Paul's friend tells the guy to back off and intimidates him into sitting back down.Paul and Audrey fly out to the facility where the downsizing process will take place. They go through a line of questioning to make sure they understand that downsizing is irreversible and that some side effects may include death. Still, Paul and Audrey appear to be cool with it.Paul is shaved from head to toe and has some teeth removed before he gets small. He later wakes up and meets a nurse who presents him with a cracker pack that's huge to them, but normal for everyone else. Paul asks for Audrey, and the nurse brings him a phone with Audrey calling him.

Dusan offers Paul a chance to get away by joining him and his friend Joris Konrad (Udo Kier) in going to Norway where the first small community was created. Ngoc Lan wants to go as well, despite Dusan saying she can't. She then mentions how she and Jorgen wrote letters to each other, as he felt terrible for what happened to her. This brings her to tears and convinces the three men to let her tag along.The group arrives in Norway and travels on a fjord to meet with Jorgen and his wife. On the journey, Paul and Ngoc Lan give into their mutual attraction and make love.

He is now in the living room and appears to have shot another man, who is lying on the floor, trying to crawl away. The man on the ground shouts his wifes name, but she does not answer.

They are on their way to check out a new house that they would like to rent together. They arrive at the house and decide to explore it, first checking out the bedroom, then the kitchen. There is no furniture at all in the place.John, Sasha, and Elliot meet up in the kitchen. Elliott decides to check out the basement in search of the promised furniture. Sasha and John join Elliott. Sasha almost falls the stairs on the way, but John catches her. Elliott notices a dresser with a couple of coins on it. They all decide that they are going to go ahead and rent the place, though the house creeps Sasha out.The next scene shows Sasha and Elliott hanging out in the evening in their bedroom, which is now furnished. Elliott is working on some sort of English paper, then gets up and goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth. He asks Sasha about the card on the bed, and so she picks it up and begins reading it out loud. It is a love letter to her from Elliott, written in newspaper clipped letters. She notices the sound of a coin rolling around on the ground. She puts the card down and looks towards the attic insulation cubby door near her. She opens the door, looks inside, but doesn't see anything. The door to Elliott and Sashas bedroom slams, startling her. She calls out to Elliott, telling him, ""That isn't funny!"" but he is nowhere to be seen.The next scene shows a party happening at Elliott, Sasha, and Johns house. The camera follows a little girl (Alice, Elliott's niece) as she wanders through the party, then up the stairs, down the hall, and over to Elliott and Sasha's bedroom. She enters the bedroom, and she hears a coin rolling around. She heads towards the insulation cubby door and opens it. As she opens it, a door directly behind her and across the room also opens, with a wolf head appearing out of it. Alice finds the coin and closes the door. As she closes the door, the door behind her closes, and the wolf head disappears. Alice puts the coin she found on the dresser and leaves the room.She heads back to the party and tells her uncle Elliott and father Virgil about the coin. At this point, most of the partiers head outside to play baseball. Elliott goes upstairs to his bedroom alone and finds the coin on the ground. He picks up the coin, opens a drawer in the nightstand, and puts it inside. As hes about to leave the room, he hears the coin fall out the back of the night stand drawer. He pulls the dresser drawer out to investigate the hole and notices that there is circular writing all over the inside of it, repeating the phrase ""Don't Say It, Don't Think It"". He realizes that it is an insert and he pulls it aside to reveal the wood on the bottom of the drawer, which has just one phrase written on it: The Bye Bye Man.Elliott heads back to the party and meets Kim, a girl that John is interested in. Kim claims to be psychically sensitive, and Elliott tries to convince her to hold a séance. She agrees to do it, and the next scene shows Elliott, Sasha, John, and Kim sitting around a table in the dark with a candle in the middle. They all hold hands and Kim reveals some little-known details about a few of them. Then, Kim becomes frightened, saying something bad is coming. She claims that the spirits to whom she speaks are repeating a phrase: ""Don't say it, don't think it"". Elliott finishes with, ""The Bye Bye Man"". All the lights go out, and they sit in the dark, freaked out.Eventually, everyone goes to bed. Sasha begins coughing and appears to be coming down with a cold. She drifts off to sleep, and Elliott looks over and seems to see a creepy figure in the bedroom corner. It seems to grow larger, and he freaks out, turning on the light and shining it at the figure. Nothing is there. Then, Elliott hears some weird scratching noises coming from downstairs. He gets up and heads downstairs to investigate. Approaching Johns room, he hears some moaning and assumes it was them. Then, he hears the scratching noises again. He heads towards the living room window since it sounds like they are coming from that direction. He looks outside but doesn't see anyone or anything.The next day, John takes Kim home. He pulls up to her house, and they both agree that neither of them have ever had a lack of performance like last night. Suddenly, John notices a couple of maggots in Kim's hair, freaking him out. He looks again, and there isn't anything there. Kim gets out of the car and goes inside, weirded out.John goes back to the house and meets up with Elliott and Sasha in the kitchen. John comments to Elliot about how he has a super hot girlfriend, which seems to irritate Elliott. John heads to the bathroom and begins to hallucinate.Back in the kitchen, Sasha is looking pale and sick. She hallucinates a shirtless John, who indicates that Elliott is a loser and that she should be with John. She looks at him, confused, and then back at Elliott. Elliott tells her that she went away for a little bit there, and wonders where she went. She does not tell him about the hallucination.Elliott and Sasha decide to head to the college to investigate the Bye Bye Man. As Elliott heads out the door, he notices some deep scratches on a stone border outside the house.Sasha heads to a greenhouse to find their landlord, and Elliott heads to the library. Sasha confronts the landlord, telling him that the house is weird. She also comments that it is really cold, to which the landlord says that her comment doesn't make sense since they are in a greenhouse, which cant be cold. She then asks him about the dresser, which seems to surprise the landlord. The landlord indicates that the dresser was not his and provides her with an address of the owner.Meanwhile, John heads to the college and shows up late to his first class. He becomes bored and starts looking at some pictures on his phone. He flips to the next picture, and its a sepia toned picture that he doesnt remember taking. It is a weird, hooded figure with a large dog next to him. John flips to the next picture, only its a video of the hooded figure. The hooded figure turns and points at John and begins walking towards him. Suddenly, the teacher slams his hand on Johns desk, startling John out of his trance.The scene switches to Elliott in the library. Elliott is using a search engine on the computer to look up first The Bye Bye Man, which produces no results. Next, he looks up ""Don't Say It, Don't Think It"", which provides one result in a Dead File within the college library. He finds the librarian, who leads him to the file. She gives him a little bit of detail on it, revealing that there was a mass murderer named Mr. Redmon who had owned the dead file.The scene flashes back to the 1960s, inside the house of the two women whom Mr. Redmon had killed. It shows him killing the two women as the librarian describes the scene. The librarian says that it looks like the information was removed from the file as if to erase its existence. Elliott shows her the page, and she reads The Bye Bye Man out loud. She thinks it is weird and leaves to help someone else.Elliott checks his phone to see the time and notices that his battery is full. He then begins scribbling out each reference to The Bye Bye Man on the page. As he does so, he looks up and notices a weird hooded figure sitting a few tables down. Each time he scribbles out one more reference, the hooded figure comes closer. Just when the figure would be right next to him, the librarian startles him. He looks down and notices that an hour has gone by and that his phone has a very low battery. He does not understand how so much time has passed and tells the librarian that he needs to go pick up Sasha.Elliott leaves the library, and once outside, he thinks he sees Sasha and John down the street. They look like they may be acting romantic, so he hides in the entry way of an abandoned building. As he looks out there, the glass right next to his head suddenly shatters, and the face of the Bye Bye Man can be seen. It vanishes, but Elliott seems spooked.Elliott ends up using a pay phone to call Kim and asks her if she would be willing to do another séance. She agrees, and we see that she is washing the blood off her hands.Elliott shows up, and Kim gets into the car. On the drive, Elliott notices that she has a bloody hammer inside her bag. They pass by a railroad track, and Kim hallucinates a car wreck. She demands that Elliott stop the car and he pulls over. She runs to the crash scene, which is on the train tracks. Elliott runs after her with the bloody hammer in hand, trying to tell her that it is a trick. She ignores him and stands right in the way of the train- and gets hit.The scene switches to the front of a train at night. It then repeats the same train sequence seen at the beginning of the film.The scene switches back to the train tracks, only it is now night time, and there are cops covering the scene. Sasha and John are now there as well. Sasha looks pretty sick and suddenly sees blood dripping on the shoes of the detective. Sasha looks up and sees blood dripping from the sockets that should have held the detectives eyes. Sasha freaks out and moves away to hurl.The detective begins to question Elliott's story, telling him that they found two bodies at Kim's place. She also says that witnesses claim to have seen Elliott chasing Kim with a bloody hammer. She decides to take Elliott in for questioning.The detective pushes Elliott for more information, but Elliott refuses to tell her about The Bye Bye Man. The detective finally lets him know that they found a suicide note from Kim at her place, and said that it confessed to the murders of the two people in her place, as well as Elliott and his friends.Free to leave, Elliott gets in his car and heads home. When he comes home, he hallucinates hearing moaning sounds coming from Johns room. He bursts into the room and thinks he sees Sasha and John naked on the bed. He hits John over the head with a baseball bat, which brings him back to reality. He ties up John so that John wont tell anyone about The Bye Bye Man and leaves Sasha lying on the bed, shivering. He notices a piece of paper on the ground, which has the address that Sasha had found for the owner of the dresser. Elliott goes upstairs to their bedroom, grabs the dresser, and throws it out of the house. Then, he takes the piece of paper and heads to the address on it.It turns out that the house belongs to Mrs. Redmon, and he speaks with her. He wants to know how she survived, so she tells him the story of her husband. The scene plays out such that you see a young Mrs. Redmon coming home to a very distraught husband. He had written Dont Say It, Dont Think It all over the walls and furniture in the house. She asks him what is wrong, but he refuses to tell her. He simply says that he was researching a murder case (he is a reporter) and that the kids had not gone mad. She presses him, but he refuses to say what was the cause of the murders. He goes into the closet and grabs a shotgun and leaves (presumably as the scene before the beginning scene of the movie).Back in the present day, Elliott asks Mrs. Redmon how she survived. She reveals that her husband never said the name, so she was never cursed. She hands Elliott a gun and tells him to kill his friends who know the name and then to kill himself to end the cycle. Elliott resists and hallucinates her flaming up into a big ball of fire. He fights, saying it isnt real. Mrs. Redmon then appears normal again.He leaves the house and drives for awhile. He thinks he sees someone in the road, but continues, thinking it is a hallucination of Sasha, and it is. This happens again, only this time he ran over the librarian. The librarian had gone crazy and killed her family and had been walking around with a knife in hand.Elliott goes home and hallucinates that John is Sasha and Sasha is John. Elliott thinks that John attacks him and Elliott ends up shooting John. After he shoots, he realizes that it was Sasha that hed shot. He sees The Bye Bye Man, who touches his forehead. Just as his forehead is touched, the doorbell rings. Its Alice and Virgil, Elliott's niece and brother. Elliott tries desperately not to say the name of The Bye Bye Man out loud and not to let the door be opened. Realizing that something is seriously wrong, Virgil tells Alice to go to the bathroom outside somewhere else. Elliott ends up killing himself. Virgil goes looking for Alice again and finds her in the car.On the ride home, Alice shows Virgil that she found a couple of coins. She says that they were in a dresser with some weird writing on it. Virgil asks what it said. She tells him that he's silly, that she can't read in the dark."
Victoria & Abdul,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5816682/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Queen Victoria strikes up an unlikely friendship with a young Indian clerk named Abdul Karim. Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal) arrives from India to participate in Queen Victoria's (Dame Judi Dench's) golden jubilee. The young clerk is surprised to find favor with the Queen. As Victoria questions the constrictions of her long-held position, the two forge an unlikely and devoted alliance that her household and inner circle try to destroy. As their friendship deepens, the Queen begins to see a changing world through new eyes, joyfully reclaiming her humanity. Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), a young prison clerk from Agra, British Raj, is instructed to travel to England for Queen Victoria's (Dame Judi Dench's) Golden Jubilee in 1887 to present her with a Mohur, a gold coin which has been minted as a token of appreciation from British-ruled India. The Queen, who is lonely and tired of her fawning courtiers, develops an interest in and later a friendship with Abdul. She spends time with him alone, and promotes him to become her Munshi. She asks him to teach her Urdu and the Qur'an. When Victoria discovers that he is married, she invites his wife and mother-in-law to join him in England. They arrive wearing black Burqas, to the consternation of the household. While Victoria treats Abdul as a son, his preferment is resented by her household and inner circle, including her son Bertie, Prince of Wales (Eddie Izzard) and Prime Minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, The Marquess of Salisbury (Sir Michael Gambon). 1887. The Indian authorities have assigned two civil servants, Abdul Karim and Mohammed, to travel to England to be an integral part of the Indian's official gift presentation to Queen Victoria, the Empress of India, for her Golden Jubilee, they chosen not for their positions within the civil service - Abdul a prison clerk - but specifically for Abdul a certain physical attribute. While Mohammed wants to get in and out of England as quickly as possible in not liking anything about English culture including the monarchy, Abdul wants to cherish the moment to make it special for the Queen. The Queen is at a phase of being dissatisfied with her life: she has been without Prince Albert, her only love, for thirty years now, she dislikes all that her children have become, including Bertie, first in line to the throne, and she has tired of the conventions of her life, especially in being surrounded by people who treat her as queen, largely for their own benefit and standing, and not a person. In Abdul breaking with protocol during the actual presentation, however small but in a way the Queen does notice, the Queen befriends him in he reigniting interest in life for her, mostly about the Indian subcontinent and its culture, to the point of appointing him in the trusted role of her personal ""munchi"": teacher. While the Queen and Abdul's relationship is not always a harmonious one, especially in Abdul sometimes shielding her from the truth in his belief it the best for her, the situation between them is made all the more difficult by the Queen's advisers, including Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, being in revolt in Abdul not only being Indian and inherently a servant, but Muslim.—Huggo 1887, British India. Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), a young prison clerk from British India, is instructed to travel to Britain for Queen Victoria's (Judi Dench) Golden Jubilee in 1887 to present her with a Mohur, a gold coin that has been minted as a token of appreciation from British-ruled India. Abdul is from a Muslim, Urdu-speaking family in India. His family had previously supplied Agra made carpets to the Royal household, and they had been very well received. Abdul travels with Mohammad Bakhsh (Adeel Akhtar).
At the actual ceremony, Abdul and Mohammad are made to wait for hrs till lunch is served. The guests can only eat till the time the Queen finishes her course, and then the plates are taken away. The guests need to be fast. She sleeps in the middle of the meal before the desert. After the desert, Abdul and Mohammad are asked to present the Mohur. Abdul was told not to have any eye contact with the majesty, but he ends up having some, while retreating.The queen, lonely and tired of her fawning courtiers (her physician wants her to eat more roughage), develops an interest (she finds him very handsome) in Abdul. Abdul and Mohammad are asked to extend their stay in England. At the next official function, Abdul is asked to serve her jelly and he ends up kissing Victoria's feet in front of everyone. Victoria appoints Abdul as her personal butler. She learns that Abdul comes from a family of carpet weavers and is somewhat of a budding poet.Victoria spends more and more time with him and eventually forms a friendship with Abdul. He tells her all about the Taj Mahal, Indian cuisine and so on. As Victoria relies more and more on Abdul, it belittles the role of Henry Ponsonby (Tim Pigott-Smith), the Queen's official PA.
As her son objects to Victoria spending so much time with Abdul, Victoria decides to retreat to a smaller castle, where she can have some privacy.
She spends time with him alone and gives him a bejeweled locket with her photograph. She promotes him to be her Munshi and asks him to teach her Urdu and the Quran. As a Munshi, Abdul is no longer a servant. He has a staff of his own and is considered a member of the household.
When Victoria discovers he is married, she has him bring his wife to England. His wife and his mother-in-law both wear black burqas, much to the consternation of the household-and the fascination of Victoria.Victoria's family includes daughter Princess Helena (Amani Zardoe) of the United Kingdom, Sophia (Sophie Trott) of Prussia, Sophie (Penny Ryder) of the Netherlands.
As Victoria's interest in India grows, she has the Durbar Room built at her Isle of Wight home of Osborne House for state functions. It is elaborately and intricately decorated, with a carpet from Agra, formal portraits of renowned Indians, a replica of the Peacock Throne and carvings by Bhai Ram Singh.While Victoria treats Abdul as a son, his preferment is resented by her household and inner circle, including her son, Bertie (Eddie Izzard), and the prime minister. The household plots to undermine their relationship, hoping that Abdul will be sent home. When Victoria embarrasses herself by recounting Abdul's one-sided account of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 to the court (she says that the Muslims helped the British in the 1857 rebellion. But in reality, the Muslims started the rebellion due to the rifle cartridges lined with pork fat), Victoria's faith and trust in him are shaken. She decides he must return to India, but soon changes her mind and asks him to stay.The prime minister is adamant that the royal household must be rid of Abdul. They research his family background in India and present Victoria with a dossier showing that his family is more ordinary and poor than Abdul claimed (Abdul had said he was from a noble family but turns out he was a simple prison clerk. He is uneducated & is using his position for personal gain). When Victoria insists that her doctor examine Abdul to learn why his wife has not become pregnant (Sir James Reid (Paul Higgins), 1st Baronet, the house physician is ordered to perform this task), he discovers that Abdul has gonorrhea. He expects the queen will dismiss Abdul in disgust, but Victoria remains loyal to him and admonishes her courtiers for plotting against him. She announces her intention to give Abdul a knighthood.Eventually, the household decides that Victoria must break with Abdul. If not, they all will resign and certify Victoria as insane. When Victoria is told by Harriet Phipps (Fenella Woolgar), she angrily summons the entire household and demands that anyone who wants to resign step forward. When no-one does, she says she has decided against making Abdul a knight. She will instead include him in her next honors list as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.When Victoria falls ill, she urges Abdul to return to India while she can still protect him and warns him that the court will turn on him after her death; Abdul insists that he will stay until Victoria's death. In 1901, Victoria dies, and her son, Bertie, now Edward VII, rejects Abdul, burning all the gifts and papers from the Queen, and sending him and his family back to India. Abdul's wife saves the locket Victoria gave him.
It is revealed that Abdul lived in India until his death eight years later in 1909. The film ends with Abdul kneeling at a large statue of Queen Victoria close to the Taj Mahal, talking to it and kissing its feet in respect."

The ladies get together, and Alice pulls out a bottle of champagne. Frankie pops it open, but the loud noise freaks everyone in the airport out.The ladies arrive at their beach house that they rented for the weekend. They meet their neighbors, Pietro (Ty Burrell) and Lea (Demi Moore), both of whom are very sexually active swingers and are particularly attracted to Blair.That night, the ladies go out to dinner. Jess wants to call it an early night but her friends are devoted to giving her the time of her life. Jess invites her Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon) to join them, making Alice clearly jealous. Frankie gets up to go to the bathroom and comes back with some cocaine, getting her friends to join her for some bumps.The friends continue their night on the town by heading to a nightclub. Alice gets wasted and starts puking. Then the ladies enter a talent competition doing a performance from when they were in college, but it gets ruined when Alice goes for a trust fall and nobody catches her. While dancing, Blair suggests to the others that they get Jess a stripper.The five friends get back home to the beach house and all of them continue doing drugs (smoking pot and snorting cocaine). The stripper, Jay (Scott Cooper), shows up. After using the bathroom, he begins to striptease for Jess. She's enjoying it until he calls her a slut. Alice then wants in on the action, so she jumps on Jay, accidentally knocking him over and causing him to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace. His head starts bleeding and the ladies freak out. Despite their efforts to help him, Jay is dead. Everyone panics since the house is made of glass and people can see them. The pizza man shows up, so Pippa answers the door to cover things up while the others try moving the body.Meanwhile, Peter is hanging out with his buddies for a wine-tasting session when he decides to call Jess. Jess is too nervous to talk and she blabs that something went wrong with a stripper/prostitute (Frankie says she got him off Craigslist). When Peter asks if she still wants to get married, Jess freaks out again when Frankie takes her phone and smashes it. Peter is left thinking Jess is cheating on him. At the behest of his friends, he is inspired to drive all the way down to Miami and win her back. He makes a stop at a convenience store for adult diapers and energy drinks.The ladies continue trying to hide the body. Frankie and Blair leave briefly to purchase a cell burner phone, leaving the other three with a dog running up to the house in front of Jay's body. Pippa tries to send the dog away before his owner appears, and she gets her left wrist bitten. They try moving the body to the garage, but the door malfunctions and the cab bringing Frankie and Blair back almost catches them. The friends realize they have no choice but to hide the body in the closet on a sex swing.Blair calls her Uncle Jack (Peter Francis James) to ask for advice. Jack says that they all could be charged for involuntary manslaughter, but with lack of evidence, they wouldn't have a case. Then he mentions that they shouldn't touch the body, but Pippa admits they already moved him. Jack says this could mean up to 15 years in prison, but then he tells the ladies if there's no body, then there's no case.The ladies contemplate chopping up the body, but they can't go through with it. They decide to take a jet ski to go out and dump Jay's corpse into the ocean. Before they can do it, Pietro and Lea come outside under the assumption that the ladies are going skinny-dipping. Pippa has to pretend to make out with Jay to avoid suspicion. The couple leaves, so the ladies say some final words for Jay before Pippa rides the jet ski far enough to dump the body. She then rides it back to the shore so fast that she flies off it and lands on her neck, but she's fine. However, Alice sees that the couple has a security camera that has possibly recorded them dumping the body. They all look at Blair for the next part of their plan.Blair reluctantly talks Pietro and Lea into sex outside by the beach so that they can have it filmed by the security cameras. After a very passionate session (off-camera), Blair asks for the tape, but the couple says that the cameras don't work since they don't pay for the service. Blair is pissed at her friends for making her go through with that, but they are just glad they are safe. They proceed to clean up all the blood in the living room.Meanwhile, Peter continues his road trip up to Miami in his diaper and hopped up on energy drinks and expired Russian speed pills. He gets pulled over by a cop for speeding, but he lets him go with a ticket. Peter then stops to get gas but his card is declined. He puts together money by encountering two separate weird guys after washing their cars. The first guy offers Peter meth and asks for a blowjob, but Peter refuses. The second guy wants to blow Peter and asks for meth, so Peter introduces the two guys and gets his gas money.At the beach house, Alice wants to do a ""Human Friendtipede"" photo outside. When they look at the picture, they see that Jay's body has washed up on the shore. They put Jay back on the sex swing, and they all hear a loud knocking at the door from someone claiming to be a cop. Frankie answers the door while the others hide. The cop, Scotty (Colton Haynes), enters and tells Frankie to get up against the wall. Scotty starts to frisk her, and Frankie headbutts him, knocking him out cold. The ladies try to pick Scotty up, but they rip off his uniform, meaning HE was the real stripper, but now they don't know who Jay was.The ladies bring Scotty upstairs to rest. Everyone is tense and still freaking out, leading to a big argument. Frankie and Blair go at it while Pippa calls Alice out for her behavior toward her all evening. Blair then lets it slip that Jess had a bridal shower that Alice wasn't invited to. Jess then admits to Alice that she is always making Jess spend time with her and making her feel guilty for not doing so, and that the bachelorette party was mostly for Alice to prove that her life doesn't suck. Alice is hurt, and Jess goes upstairs to calm herself down.Moments later, another knock is heard at the door. Two guys, Frazier (Dean Winters) and Ruiz (Enrique Murciano), claim to be detectives and ask for Jay. Alice answers the door and admits that Jay is dead. They show the guys Jay's body in the closet. Frazier says this was self-defense, so the ladies are off the hook. They cheer the fact that they are safe. Frazier then asks the ladies about diamonds that Jay stole and is hiding. Pippa then sees on the TV that police are looking for Jay, Frazier, and Ruiz, who are all diamond thieves. Although Pippa tries to alert the other ladies, the guys hear the news report and hold the ladies hostage, plus Scotty when he wakes up and starts screaming.Jess finds a card from Alice that says how much their friendship means to Alice because Jess was her first true friend when they were in school. Jess then hears the commotion downstairs. Frazier goes up and gets sprayed in the face with hairspray. Jess gets his gun and forces him to handcuff himself to the sink while she goes to save her friends. She aims her gun at Ruiz, who has everyone tied up together. Before she can pull the trigger, Ruiz moves and Jess has it aimed at Alice. She stops herself quickly and instead leaps off the balcony to tackle Ruiz. While she fights him, the others grab Ruiz's gun, and Alice shoots him in the leg before Jess bludgeons him with a statue. Jess goes to help her friends, but Frazier uncuffed himself since the keys were attached to the cuffs. He prepares to kill them until Peter drives through the front of the house, slamming into Frazier and killing him. Jess goes over to Peter, who still thinks Jess was cheating. She clarifies things and says she still wants to get married, and even suggests that they do it immediately.The next day, Jess and Peter are married at a foam party that Alice got tickets to, with Pippa officiating. The friends all enjoy the party, with Frankie and Blair getting back together, and Alice going to hook up with Scotty. Jess then gets a call from one of the campaign managers who tells her that the story of her and her friends taking out the diamond thieves is big news, bringing in lots of sponsors and volunteers, inspiring confidence in Jess's election. She is asked to come back to start interviews, but she chooses to stay to enjoy time with Peter and her friends.During the credits, we see that Jess has officially been elected state senator. Pippa goes up to perform a song with painfully obvious lyrics about them killing a guy.After the credits, Jess and Peter take Alice home from the party. Alice goes to make herself some penis pasta, and she discovers the stolen diamonds which were hidden in that pasta box the whole time."
My Little Pony: The Movie,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131800/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a dark force conquers Canterlot, the Mane 6 embark on an unforgettable journey beyond Equestria where they meet new friends and exciting challenges on a quest to use the magic of friendship to save their homeland. After a dark force conquers Canterlot, the Mane 6 - Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, and Rarity - embark on an unforgettable journey beyond Equestria where they meet new friends and exciting challenges on a quest to use the magic of friendship to save their homeland.—Yamerah Bing The ponies of Equestria prepare for their first Friendship Festival, overseen by Princess Twilight Sparkle in Canterlot. The festivities are interrupted by an invasion of monsters commanded by the broken-horned unicorn Tempest Shadow, who uses magical obsidian orbs to petrify Twilight's fellow princesses; Princess Celestia gives Princess Luna incomplete instructions to seek help from ""the queen of the hippo"" before they are both petrified. Twilight flees the city alongside her five pony friends - Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy - and her dragon assistant, Spike. Tempest is contacted by her superior, the Storm King, who reminds her to gather all of Equestria's princesses for him to harness their magic through his mystical staff, promising to restore her horn in exchange.. In the magical Land of Equestria, at the capital city kingdom of Canterlot Castle, Princess Twilight Sparkle and her best friends, that form the Mane 6 (Applejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie) and Spike the young purple dragon, are getting ready for the new annual Friendship Festival. There, Twilight is feeling overwhelmed organizing the event as the Princess of Friendship, especially since her fellow princesses, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and Princess Cadance, decline her more grandiose proposals. However, her friends sing a song to encourage her. With such support, the festival gets underway.However, an invading fleet of dark storm airship blimps led by the villainous renegade unicorn, Tempest Shadow, soon arrives and demands the Ponies surrender. When the Princesses refuse, as Tempest had hoped, her forces quickly attack overwhelm Canterlot's defenses including magically freezes/encases almost all the Princesses in stone. Twilight almost shares that fate, but for Rainbow Dash saving Twilight just in time while the cross-eyed Pegasus, Muffin Hooves, sacrifices herself taking the blow, providing a critical few minutes distraction for the Mane 6 to escape.Twilight and her friends escape after hearing Celestia's last words to Luna ""Go South past the badlands to find the Queen of the Hyppo-"" just before she is cut off just as she is petrified to stone. Twilight thinks they need to find the Queen of the Hippos, and set off while Tempest learns of their escape.After an arduous trek through the Equestrian desert badlands, they find a forbidding desert city called Klugetown. It has many monsters that sell other animals and after Pinkie Pie, against Twilight's advice, foolishly calls attention to themselves to request help, the Mane 6 are surrounded by the denizens of the city desiring to exploit them. However, a charming and sly fox-like humanoid cat called Capper comes and saves them. After secretly arranging a message to be sent to a creditor that he will have something to offer to settle his debt, Capper lures the Mane 6 to his home offering to help them both considering shelter and claiming to have information about the location the ""Hippos"" they seek, over Twilight's suspicious objections about trusting a complete stranger.Once there, Rarity, the most trusting of all of Capper, surprises the cat by repairing and improving his suit, in an act of selfless generosity he cannot comprehend, while Twilight finds a map showing that it is not the Queen of the Hippos they are looking for, but the Queen of the Hyppogryphs. Realizing that Capper was being untruthful to them, Twilight's suspicions are confirmed when Capper's creditor, a mole-like creature named Mr Verko, arrives to take the Mane 6 into slavery as recompense for Capper's debt. Meanwhile, Tempest has arrived in the city in pursuit of the princess, and arrives at Capper's house seconds after his creditor did.As Tempest violently subdues the criminal when he attempts to enslave her, the Mane 6 flee in the confusion until they reach the airship docks and desperately stowaway in a departing delivery airship. Meanwhile, frustrated at her quarry escaping again, Tempest demands that Capper tell her where the Mane 6 are going. Although obviously frightened by Tempest's threats, Capper is reminded by Rarity's repairs to his coat of how goodhearted the Mane 6 are and confesses a false destination to throw Tempest off their trail. Unfortunately, Tempest forces Capper to accompany them to prove his story true.On the airship, the Mane 6 are discovered by its crew of humanoid parrots under the command of Captain Calaeno. They crew is just about to toss them overboard when the lunch signal is sounded and they immediately break to have lunch with Mane 6 invited to the table. Moving past this strange professionalism and generosity, Rainbow Dash finds out that they used to be pirates before the mysterious Storm King forced them to become delivery birds. Delighted to meet actual pirates, Rainbow sings an encouraging song that restores the Pirates' mojo and they throw off the shackles of their servitude to the Storm King. However, at this exciting development, Dash overdoes her adulation over Twilight's objections and performs a Sonic Rainboom, a bright rainbow colored shock-wave, that alerts the pursuing Tempest of their position.Tempest and her crew overtake and board the ship and threatens the pirate crew to surrender the Mane 6. Hiding in the hold, Twilight finds a way to escape by having everyone drop down a bottom hatch and barely assembles a makeshift balloon for her flightless friends as they fall. Meanwhile, they see that the pirate ship is destroyed above them presumably with the crew and Capper.The Mane 6 land and continue the journey to the Queen of the Hyppogryph's castle, which is supposedly on Mount Eris. They reach the castle only to find it completely abandoned and they hear a singing voice coming from inside the castle. They creep past the rubble to an interior pool and get there just in time to see a glowing shape slip inside the water. Pinkie Pie dives under and comes back up with no news of the glowing shape, before they can get out of the pool however, they get sucked in and almost drown.They are saved by the same glowing yellow shape which blows bubbles of oxygen around their heads and they are brought to the underwater palace of the Queen's the princess is the glowing shape and she introduces herself as Princess Skystar and the Queen is Queen Novo, Queen of the Hyppogryphs. They turned into merponies when The Storm King tried to steal the pearl that gives them the magic to turn into merponies. They turn Twilight and her friends into merponies and Twilight tries to plead Queen Novo to let her borrow the pearl so that they can turn everypony in Equestria into merponies to fight the Storm King. Despite, Princess Skystar's excited pleas to participate, Queen Novo refuses and the ponies get ready to leave.Then in sheer desperation, secretly Twilight comes up with a plan to steal the pearl away and she manipulates Pinkie and the others to go distract Skystar while she does so. Later, Queen Novo comes and sees Skystar making good friends outside the palace and she is about to help them when an alarm rings. Furious at what Twilight was attempting in return for her hospitality, Queen Novo takes away their merpony magic and banishes the Mane 6 at the surface sputtering and splashing.Now seeing all their efforts have been in vain, Twilight's friends are angered upon realizing that she used them for a scheme that would have been unnecessary if she hadn't ruined things. At the end of her own patience, Twilight angrily rants that her friends' collective stupidity throughout this quest left her with no alternative and she has had enough of their incompetence. Deeply offended, Twilight's friends outside of Spike angrily abandon her and Twilight is left alone deeply regretting her her temper and her failure in her mission.However, her funk is quickly interrupted by Tempest Shadow who captures her. Securing her in a magic-proof cage, Tempest sings a song to her about the real world and the backstory of Tempest's life as a filly plays while she sings. Tempest explains that she was a happy filly until an attack by an Ursa Major (Lunas Bear) scarred her and broke off her horn, leading her to be rejected by her peers and embittered. Thus, she now serves the Stormking who has promised to restore her horn if she helps him gain the power of the Princesses of Equestria.Meanwhile, Twilight's friends get over their bitterness and are about to talk to her when Spike comes running about her abduction. Now, desperate to help Twilight, their despair at their helplessness to do so is relieved when Skystar appears, still eager to help. Furthermore, the Pirates and Capper arrive at the moment, having somehow survived Tempest's wrath to offer to help as well.Twilight is taken back to Canterlot where she sees everypony is enslaved and/or caged. For instance, she sees the sing, Songbird Serenade (Canterlot's pop-star Pegasus), trapped inside a cage trying to sing, but silenced every time she tries, she lowers her head in shame and is brought to the throne room. Taken to the palace, the Storm King arrives, revealing himself to be a Grey lightning-powered powerful ape-like faun monster. and in his rage complaining about the castle's cute aesthetic, he stabs his staff into the floor and it absorbs the magic form all four princesses.Meanwhile, Capper is able to smuggle the Mane Six and the Pirates into Canterlot with a giant Trojan cake. However, they are spotted by Tempest's hedgehog sidekick Grubber and must fight the Storm King's minions. Eventually, the Pirate tell the Mane 6 to get to the palace while they keep minions busy.As the Storm King enthusiastically revels at the incredible power he now has, Tempest reminds him of his bargain with her. However, the Storm King admits that he was using Tempest and has no intention of upholding his end of the bargain. At this betrayal, Tempest tries to fight but is instead zapped towards the railing where she clings on for her life as the storm/whirlwind rages around the castle. After freeing herself, Twilight has to pick between taking the staff from the fallen Storm King or saving Tempest. Against her apparent better judgment but with her conscience, Twilight decides to save Tempest to the renegade's shock.Then, the Storm King gets back up just as Twilight pulls Tempest up and he gets ready to zap them with his newly enchanted staff. At this time, the Mane 6 shoot themselves to the castle with Pinkie's humongous party cannon and they knock the Storm King over just as he is about to blast Twilight and Tempest. The staff is about to be pulled into the storm outside and zaps the roof, causing it to crumble, Twilight and her friends are trying to get to the staff before the Storm King and they succeed causing the Storm King and Twilight to hurtle into the storm.After an agonizing few seconds, Twilight returns unharmed with the staff, though, and the friends embrace. However, while they are embracing, the Storm King crawls back up the railing and gets ready to encase Twilight and her friends to stone with the power ball that zapped the other Princesses into stone. Tempest jumps in front of them, saving them, but the spell also backfires and hits the Storm King, petrifying him into a statue which meets doom as it smashes apart in the resulting fall (although he is not strictly ""dead""). However, Twilight and her friends save Tempest from the same fate and they free her and the Princesses.Together, Tempest and all the princesses magically restore Equestria's magic and the Friendship Festival resumes in light of this victory, this time with all the other new friends they have made. They have their party and Songbird Serenade sings her new single ""Rainbow"" with friends are rewarded such as Capper getting a stylish top hat and cape ensemble from Rarity in light of his heroic efforts helping them.During the celebration, Twilight tells the now forgiven Tempest that she is already very powerful, horn or not and invites her to stay in Equestria. Moved by Twilight's offer, Tempest at least uses her still considerable magic to make the light show the Princess of Friendship originally wanted. As they then move to join the festivities, Tempest quietly tells Pinkie Pie her real name 'Fizzlepop Berrytwist' and Pinkie Pie ends the movie by joyously shrieking how wonderful that name is."
The Disaster Artist,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521126/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When aspiring actorGreg Sesteromeets the weird and mysteriousTommy Wiseauin an acting class, they form a unique friendship and travel to Hollywood to make their dreams come true. Aspiring actor Greg Sestero befriends the eccentric Tommy Wiseau. The two travel to L.A., and when Hollywood rejects them, Tommy decides to write, direct, produce and star in their own movie. That movie is, ""The Room,"" which has attained cult status as the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad movies.—rorybobglynn In the 1990s, Greg Sestero is an aspiring actor, who meets the strange Tommy Wiseau in an acting class. Together, Tommy inspires Greg to overcome his nervousness in acting so well that Greg agrees to come to Los Angeles with his odd new friend to pursue their dreams. However, their dreams seem to prove hopeless, especially for Tommy whose mysteriously strange accent and personality repels nearly all around him. Out of an inadvertent suggestion from Greg, Tommy is inspired to instead create his own movie,The Room (2003). What follows is a bizarre struggle to create that film, guided by Tommy, a man who has plenty of money, but not a trace of filmmaking education, experience, talent or even common sense. Along the way, Greg's friendship with Tommy is put to the test as this project takes shape that would produce a film that ultimately becomes a bizarre accomplishment of a cult classic nature that no one, including Tommy, can see coming.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Waiting for his big break in late-1990s California, the young hopeful actor,Greg Sestero, is thrilled to unexpectedly discover his soulmate, the eccentric and rather cryptic amateur performer,Tommy Wiseau, in his acting class. With dreams of making it big in Hollywood, the aspiring big movie stars move to sunny Los Angeles, only to realise--one disastrous audition after another--that the world isn't quite ready for their great talent yet. Eventually, in one of those spur-of-the-moment decisions and burning with desire to prove everyone wrong, Tommy and Greg will venture into the uncharted waters of filmmaking to make their own movie; however, they are clearly way out of their element. The final result of their combined efforts isThe Room (2003), a monument of courage, perseverance, and above all, passion.—Nick Riganas San Francisco, 1998. Aspiring actor Greg Sestero meets Tommy Wiseau in an acting class. Wiseau is off-the-scale weird and hopelessly untalented as an actor but has a stupendous amount of self-confidence. Sestero and Wiseau form a friendship and move to Los Angeles to pursue their dream of making it big in Hollywood. After landing no roles, they decide to make their own movie. Produced, directed and written by Wiseau and with him in the lead role, the resulting movie is regarded as one of the worst movies ever made, if not THE worst - The Room.—grantss The film starts with a bunch of celebrities (Kristen Bell, Ike Barinholtz, Kevin Smith, Adam Scott, Lizzy Caplan, Keegan-Michael Key, JJ Abrams, and Danny McBride among others) talking about a particular movie that is incomparable, unlike anything they've seen before, and perhaps even a bit amazing. That movie is ""The Room"".San Francisco, July 1998Greg Sestero (Dave Franco) is in an acting class doing a scene from ""Waiting For Godot"", but he's very shy and cannot express his acting talent the way he wants. The teacher, Jean Shelton (Melanie Griffith), criticizes Greg and his partner for not being fearless enough to show the class who they really are. When Jean asks for someone to be fearless, one man in the class responds. His name is Tommy Wiseau (James Franco). He and his partner get up in front of everyone to do the ""STELLA!"" scene from ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", but Tommy just does weird stuff like climbing the wall and yelling incoherently. Nobody is impressed, except for Greg. After class, Greg approaches Tommy and expresses his admiration for Tommy being as bold as he was. He asks Tommy if they can read a scene together, and Tommy agrees.Tommy picks Greg up in his neighborhood. Greg admires Tommy's car, but he firmly tells Greg not to ask him anything about what he does, where he gets his money, or where he comes from. The two then go to a restaurant where Tommy convinces Greg to read a scene. Greg reads it nervously, but Tommy pushes him to give a performance that the whole restaurant hears.Tommy and Greg become very close. Tommy tells Greg about how he wanted to be an actor and went after it despite what others have told him. After watching ""Rebel Without A Cause"", they drive out to the site of the car crash that killed James Dean, with Greg musing that he was so young and talented and was gone so soon. Tommy decides that they should waste no time in making their dreams come true, so they decide to move to Los Angeles and stay in an apartment that Tommy owns.Greg packs up his bags to move out. His mother (Megan Mullally) is concerned for Greg going off with a man he barely knows. Tommy picks Greg up and they head off.Los Angeles, November 1998Greg signs to an agency with Iris Burton (Sharon Stone) as his agent. Meanwhile, Tommy is less lucky, with nobody liking his head shots or auditions. The two go to a nightclub to celebrate Greg getting signed. He hits it off with the bartender, Amber (Alison Brie), which appears to make Tommy a bit jealous. He forces Greg out of the club just as Amber is giving him her number.Greg and Amber start dating regularly. Tommy grows more rude and frustrated as he isn't having any success. One night, he is at a restaurant where he spots a well-known producer (Judd Apatow). Tommy approaches him in the middle of his dinner and tries to do a very loud and over-the-top ""Hamlet"" monologue before security comes to get him. The producer flat-out tells Tommy that he will never make it.Tommy and Greg stand on the rooftop of their place, both feeling dejected with their lack of work. Greg says that Iris hasn't been returning his calls, and he hasn't been nabbing many auditions. Tommy feels as though Hollywood has straight-up rejected him. Greg says he wishes they could make their own movie so they can have their own roles. Tommy thinks it's a great idea.Tommy immediately begins working on his movie script. In 2001, he has completed the script for ""The Room"". He shows the script to Greg and lets him read it at a diner. The dialogue is ridiculous, but Greg tells Tommy he thinks it's good. Tommy tells him he will play the main role of Johnny, and Greg will play his best friend Mark. The two vow to make the film and howl (literally) with excitement.The guys go to Birns and Sawyer to meet with Peter Anway (Jason Mantzoukas) and Bill Meurer (Hannibal Buress) to gather film equipment. Although it's an equipment rental store, Peter and Bill let Tommy purchase all of what he needs. They get a bit apprehensive when he says he wants to shoot on both 35mm film AND digital, but Tommy insists he has the money for it. Peter and Bill agree to it, and they give him the equipment at a reduced price on the condition that he shoots in their studio. Tommy and Greg agree.The next move is to gather other actors and crew members. Tommy and Greg audition a bunch of actresses for the part of Lisa, Johnny's girlfriend. The auditions are ridiculous, and at least one woman is horrified to think she would have to play Tommy's girlfriend. They eventually land on an actress named Juliette Danielle (Ari Graynor). Peter and Bill introduce Tommy to Rafael Smadja (Paul Scheer), the director of photography, and Sandy Schklair (Seth Rogen), the script supervisor, as well as Amy (Kelly Oxford) for makeup and Safoya (Charlyne Yi) for wardrobe.Once the whole cast and crew have been gathered, Tommy gives them a speech as they prepare to make a great movie. They start by shooting a scene with Philip Haldiman (Josh Hutcherson), who plays Denny, and Dan Janjigian (Zac Efron), who plays Chris R. Tommy is impressed with Dan's intensity during the scene where Chris R violently presses Denny for money owed to him.While out at dinner, Greg and Amber tell Tommy that they plan on having him move into her apartment. Tommy goes outside and angrily thrashes newspapers around.Although the production starts off smooth, things quickly start to deteriorate. Of note is when the crew has to film the notorious ""Oh hi Mark"" scene. Tommy forgets his own line (that HE wrote) and forces them to go through over 60 takes. Greg goes to hand him an empty water bottle so that Tommy can be more ""intense"". Tommy does the line in one last take, and the crew bursts into applause.Another rough moment comes when they film a sex scene between Johnny and Lisa. Tommy walks around naked and insists that he ""show his ass"" to sell the movie. He starts to insult Juliette when he notices a pimple on her shoulder and demands that it be covered with makeup for not being sexy enough. Tommy goes too far and pisses off Rafael, who threatens him. Tommy threatens to fire Rafael, but Greg tries to quell the tension, and Juliette is brave enough to continue as is. The scene itself is just awkward from Tommy's positioning, as Sandy notes it looks like Tommy is penetrating Juliette's belly button.On a particularly hot day, the cast and crew are overheated since Tommy refused to pay for air conditioning or water. On top of that, he's four hours late. When he arrives, Sandy and Rafael grill him, and the actress playing Claudette, Carolyn Minnott (Jacki Weaver), faints from heatstroke. The others try to wake her up, but Tommy coldly accuses her of napping on the job. As the arguing grows intense, Tommy brings out someone named Markus that he hired to film the crew when they weren't looking to see what they were saying about him. Tommy knows they don't take him seriously and call him things like Frankenstein and a ""vampire rapist"".During lunch, Greg sits with the rest of the cast. Philip asks Greg just what the hell the movie is about. Robyn Paris (June Diane Raphael), who plays Michelle, muses that the characters are inspired by people Tommy knew, and that Lisa, who betrays Johnny, is the universe as a whole. Greg then asks Carolyn why she continues to do the job even after all she's been put through. She responds that it's because they're actors, and even for them, the worst day on a set is better than most days anywhere else.Greg and Amber are out getting coffee when they see Bryan Cranston. Greg is a fan and Amber knows him from a Pilates class. She introduces them, and when Bryan learns that Greg is an actor, he tells him that they need an actor to play a lumberjack on an upcoming episode of ""Malcolm in the Middle"", and as long as Greg has his beard, he's got the part. Excited, Greg goes to tell Tommy since the next day would call for a scene where Greg gets shaved. Tommy doesn't like the idea since he thinks Greg wants to be committed to something other than his project. When given an ultimatum, Greg doesn't respond, and Amber leaves out of disappointment for him being unable to stand up to Tommy.The crew is now more than 12 days over filming. They shoot a scene where Johnny commits suicide after discovering Lisa's betrayal. Tommy puts the gun in his mouth and then starts writhing around and humping Lisa's dress (which Juliette wanted to keep).On the last day of filming, Tommy takes Greg to the park to film a scene just for him to get real emotions. Tommy also mentions that he let Sandy and Rafael go. Greg gets very real and starts to ask Tommy personal questions he hates, like where he gets his money, how old he is, and where he's really from. Tommy always insisted he's from New Orleans, despite his accent. The two eventually get into a fight, and they split up.Eight months later.Greg and Amber have broken up since she moved to Austin. He has gotten a steady gig at a local stage theater. Greg is driving and talking to his mom when he sees a billboard for ""The Room"" with Tommy's face.Tommy finds Greg after one of his performances. He personally invites him to the upcoming premiere of ""The Room"". Although hesitant, Greg accepts.The two pull up in a limo that is filled with a bunch of ""The Room"" merchandise that Tommy paid for. When they get to the theater, Tommy is surprised that Sandy, Rafael, and the whole cast have shown up.Tommy introduces the film before a packed house. The audience reacts with laughter at the ridiculousness of the film, as well as loud disgust at the sex scene with Tommy's ass in full view. Even Juliette is horrified that the scene is so long. The rest of the film is met with uproarious laughter, and the cast stating how bad most of it is. Tommy becomes visibly upset at the audience's reaction, and Greg notices. Tommy walks out before the end. Greg runs outside to comfort him, with Tommy expressing how he feels everyone hates him. Greg insists that's not the case, as the audience is having a great time. They chant ""Do it! Do it! Do it!"" when Johnny commits suicide, and once the film ends, everyone gives Tommy a standing ovation. He goes to the front and thanks them for liking his ""comedy"", as he claims was always his vision. He credits Greg for helping him, and Greg joins Tommy as they receive another round of applause.The final text states that ""The Room"" was shown in one theater and made $1,800 in its opening weekend. Tommy Wiseau paid for it to stay an extra two weeks in order for it to get a qualifying Oscar run. To this day, nobody knows where Tommy's from, how he got his money, or how old he is. He and Greg Sestero remain friends and continue to write, act, and produce. They will always be best known for ""The Room"".The credits feature side-by-sides of the actual film of ""The Room"" with almost exact shot-for-shot copies from this film. After the credits, we see Tommy approached at a party by a weird stranger named Henry (played the real Tommy Wiseau). Henry invites Tommy to hang out, but he declines."

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6003368/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Heffley family road trip to attend Meemaw's 90th birthday party goes hilariously off course thanks to Greg's newest scheme to get to a video gaming convention. A Heffley family road trip to attend Meemaw's 90th birthday party goes hilariously off course thanks to Greg's newest scheme to get to a video gaming convention. This family cross-country adventure turns into an experience the Heffleys will never forget.—Twentieth Century Fox One year after the previous film, while at the Corny's family restaurant, the Heffley family - consists of Greg, Rodrick, Frank, Susan and Manny - plans to attend Meemaw's 90th birthday. However, after Greg and Rowley rescue his younger brother Manny, who got stuck inside a tube in the play area, Greg ends up in a ball pit with a diaper stuck on his hand, startling him. He subsequently becomes famous after the people around him record him and post the footage on the internet, leading Greg to be dubbed as ""Diaper Hands"", much to Greg's devastation. Later, at the Heffley residence, Greg learns that Player Expo is taking place not very far from Meemaw's house in Indianapolis. Greg's gaming star, Mac Digby, will be attending, and Greg hopes to meet him and get in one of his videos so he will gain newfound popularity.. The Heffley family: Greg (Jason Drucker), Rodrick (Charlie Wright), Frank (Tom Everett Scott), Susan (Alicia Silverstone), and Manny (Dylan and Wyatt Walters) - plus Rowley (Owen Asztalos) arrive at Corny's, a family-friendly restaurant that Greg thinks is for babies. At the table, Greg and Rowley watch a video of their idol, internet celebrity Mac Digby (Joshua Hoover), whom Susan considers a bad influence. Manny then gets stuck in the tube maze above the ball pit, which means Greg must go get him. He gets bombarded by other smaller kids and then loses Manny in the ball pit. Greg scrambles to find him but then ends up getting a dirty diaper stuck to his hands. As he tries to shake the diaper off, other kids and adults start laughing and recording Greg on their phones.Greg becomes a viral sensation known as ""Diaper Hands"", which has left him humiliated. He finds out that Mac is going to be at a video game convention, Player Expo. Since the Heffleys are heading on a road trip for their Meemaw's 90th birthday, Greg tries to find a way to get to Player Expo and take a video with Mac so that everyone can forget about Diaper Hands.The Heffleys pack up for their road trip, but their van becomes cluttered with so much luggage that Frank considers flying. Not wanting to miss the convention, Greg suggests putting all their luggage in Frank's boat so that they'll have space and possibly get the boat on the water.As the family hits the road, Susan forces her sons to give up their phones so that they can have a ""disconnected"" family vacation free of electronics. Greg and Rodrick reluctantly hand over their phones. She also makes them eat healthy snacks instead of stopping to eat something. For fun, Susan pulls out a card game where people confess to things. It takes a real turn when Greg uses something he knows Rodrick did and makes him admit it. Frank and Susan follow suit and make Rodrick admit to other naughty things he's done, then forcing him to apologize on the phone to their neighbor whose house he TP'd a while back. Rodrick shoots Greg a death glare and promises to get him back.The family passes by a grocery store and drops Greg and Rodrick so they don't wake Manny from his nap (because that would be really bad). Instead of sticking to Susan's list of healthy junk, Rodrick grabs a bunch of sugary junk.The Heffleys stop at a crummy motel for the night. The boys want to use the pool but find that it has been drained. All that's left is a hot tub which is being occupied by a family that Greg refers to as ""the Beardos"" (because the dad has a big beard). Later that night, the family leaves the hot tub, so the brothers go for a dip. Greg has taken his phone, and Rodrick finds out. He goes to tell on Greg as payback for the card game. Greg tries to get out but accidentally pulls a bag of cheese puffs into the hot tub, turning him orange. He then tells Rodrick about the Player Expo and how he may have a chance to earn a cash prize to fix his van and maybe even meet hot girls in cosplay. Rodrick agrees to join Greg.When Greg goes back to his room, he finds Frank using his computer to do work stuff. They agree to keep their electronics use a secret from Susan to not upset her. Greg then tries to go to bed but has no room on the couch or bed. He goes to sleep in the closet but then hears a banging noise from outside. Greg steps out the room and finds the Beardo kids making noise as they've stolen a snack cart. Greg tells them to be quiet but the kids push the cart at him. The cart hits the Beardo family's van, just as Mr. Beardo (Chris Coppola) steps out. He freaks out when the cart scratches the van, and his daughter pins the blame on Greg. Greg runs away until the coast is clear so he can return to his room. In the morning, he realizes he walked into the Beardos' room and slept next to Mr. Beardo. He runs out and back to his room.The Heffleys go back on the road and stop at a country fair. Greg and Rodrick eat deep-fried butter on a stick, but Greg sees the Beardo family walking around. He runs and ends up having to take Manny while Frank makes a business call. The boys come across a game where they must guess the weight of a pig in exchange for a lollipop. Manny manages to guess the exact weight of the pig and earns a small piglet as a prize. Greg says they can't keep it for reasons that unintentionally insult the farm folks in that area, so the boys leave. Greg and Mr. Beardo spot each other, so Greg gives Manny the piglet and runs again. Greg and Rodrick go on a Gravitron, after Rodrick has eaten his 9th butter stick. Mr. Beardo follows Greg in there as the ride starts up. Greg climbs over some kids while Beardo tries to reach him. Beardo presses on Rodrick's stomach, causing Rodrick to blow chunks that fly into Beardo's face (and mouth). The boys run and find the rest of their family, which leads to Susan finding out about Frank and Greg using their phones. She angrily tells them they are leaving and keeping the piglet.Frank is making a call on the road but keeps getting interrupted by his family making noises. Things get chaotic when they nearly get run off the road by a truck driver, causing Frank to drop his phone and accidentally blurt out that he's taken time off, which he didn't tell his bosses about.The family stops at another hotel and sneaks the piglet in a cooler. He ends up eating everything in the minibar, which angers Frank because it means he has to pay extra. When they hit the road again, Greg has to pee and can't wait because the next stop is 37 miles. He goes in two lemonade bottles moments before the piglet starts pooping in the car, to the family's disgust. They have no choice but to drop the piglet off at a petting zoo, to Manny's sadness.The family stops at another hotel but are now closer to Meemaw's party. However, Greg and Rodrick sneak out and pretend to go look for a gift when they are actually going to Player Expo. Greg is excited to be there, except for the fact that someone is cosplaying as Diaper Hands. Greg sees Mac Digby playing a game trying to make ""gamer history"" by beating the score. Greg sneaks past security and tries to get Rodrick to take a video. Greg startles Mac and accidentally disconnects the game, ruining Mac's score. To make things worse, Frank and Susan show up after seeing the boys on the news. Susan angrily makes her way to the stage and outs Greg as Diaper Hands. Mac and the rest of the audience get excited but Greg is once again embarrassed, knowing he will never live this down. He snaps at Susan that she's been making everyone do what she wants but doesn't care about what everyone else wants. To top it all off, Greg used the front-face camera to take the video, so Greg has no proof of being next to Mac.While back on the road, the tarp covering the boat undoes itself, causing the family's luggage to spill all over the road. The Beardo family shows up and takes advantage of this to get payback on the boys. Beardo steals a bag that contains a scrapbook that Susan wanted to give to Meemaw. The Heffleys go after them but get stuck in traffic. They try to take another route, and they end up overheating their car. Everyone becomes upset over how everything has turned out. The boys make peace with their parents and plan to turn the heat up in their car to get it running again.Frank gets the car running again but they end up in the woods near some hunting grounds. A pack of cinnamon rolls falls near the heater and bursts, startling everyone and spraying goo everywhere. Rodrick freaks out and thinks he's been shot and his brains are coming out, but they realize what the problem is. The car also gets stuck in a small hole. Frank hits the gas as his family steps outside, spraying all of them with mud.The family keeps moving and passes by a motel where they see the Beardo family van. The Beardos go to the pool, giving the Heffleys a chance to sneak into their room, clean up, and get their stuff. Greg gets stuck in the bathroom as Mr. Beardo returns. He stays long enough to poop (and not wash his hands). Greg tries to get out but accidentally turns on the shower. Beardo comes back and tries to get Greg (in a parody of ""Psycho""), but the boy squirts shampoo in Beardo's eyes. Greg runs for it and rejoins his family as they got their stuff back. Frank then throws Beardo's van keys into the dumpster as they drive off. Beardo hops in the dumpster and gets a diaper stuck on his hand.The Heffleys run out of road to drive on and start riding up a hill, but their car finally dies. They seem to give up until Greg sees Meemaw's house down the hill. The family starts to push the van down the hill before hopping in. Greg misses the van and hops on the boat. The boat unhooks from the car and goes down the hill, sending Greg flying over the fence and into Meemaw's pool. The rest of the family shows up, and Meemaw is happy to see them.After the party, the Heffleys head for home, but their car breaks down again. A tow truck driver stops on the road, but he only speaks Spanish. Thankfully, Manny speaks good Spanish and tells the driver they need a lift. Manny guides the driver to the petting zoo where they get the piglet back.Greg narrates that things worked out well for everyone when they got home. Frank is allowed time off from work to spend with his family. Rodrick gets money to repair his van. Greg says that while this vacation was far from perfect, it was certainly eventful. He expresses excitement for where they'll be going next year, but Susan steps in to say they will be flying."
The Circle,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4287320/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman lands a dream job at a powerful tech company called the Circle, only to uncover an agenda that will affect the lives of all of humanity. When Mae is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey, to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes, begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity. Mae Holland is a recent college graduate who lands a job at a next generation tech company known as The Circle. She starts off work in the customer service department but after an incident is invited to meet Eamon Bailey, the head of The Circle. This meeting starts a new chapter for Mae, one which gives her more insight into the powerful internet corporation seeking to revolutionize the entire world.—Viir khubchandani When her car breaks down, Mae Holland contacts an old acquaintance, Mercer, who is liked by her parents: Vinnie - Mae's father - has multiple sclerosis and needs the help of his wife, Bonnie. Mae's friend Annie Allerton works at The Circle, a tech company where Mae gets a job in Customer Experience. At a company meeting, Eamon Bailey (The Circle's CEO) introduces SeeChange, which uses small cameras placed anywhere to provide real-time video. At work, Mae rises in The Circle, embracing social networking. At a further company presentation emphasizing the need for accountability in politics, The Circle's Chief Operating Officer (COO), Tom Stenton, introduces a political candidate who has agreed to open her daily workings to the public through Circle.. After a day of kayaking, Mae Holland (Emma Watson) is on her way home when her car starts to have trouble, and she is forced to pull over on the side of the road. She contacts Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) who arrives to take a look at the vehicle. The two evidently have some history, and after Mercer is finished looking at the vehicle, Mae tells him that they should get together some time and that she'll text him or email him. Mercer responds by saying that they could just talk now since they are both present. Mae smiles at this suggestion and heads home.The next day, while stuck at a dead end job, Mae gets a call from her friend Annie Allerton (Karen Gillan). Annie works at The Circle, a powerful tech company, and is one of the 40 most influential people in the company. Annie is constantly traveling because of her responsibilities and is surprisingly upbeat and energetic for the amount of stress that accompanies her job. Mae interviews at The Circle and gets a job in Customer Experience, an entry level position that requires her to assist users of The Circle's products and services. She is constantly rated out of a score of 100 by the people she assists, and she is very driven to keep her score high.At a company-wide meeting, the CEO Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) introduces a new initiative called SeeChange. The initiative involves small cameras that can be placed anywhere and are meant to make the world more transparent. Eamon gives a big speech about the human rights implications of these cameras. The cameras come in different colors to allow them to be camouflaged and they provide real-time video feeds. This initiative is based on the notion of making life more transparent.The Circle owns a very large campus, and it becomes apparent later on that the company strongly encourages its employees to spend a lot of time on the campus. During a company-wide party on campus, Beck is performing. Annie sneaks Mae away from the party and takes her to an office. Annie explains that Mae actually shouldn't be in the office and that it is where Eamon and the Chief Operating Officer, Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt), make the big decisions for the company.After leaving the office, Mae sees an employee away from all of the events, glued to his phone. Mae approaches and begins a conversation. He asks her if she is a guppy, a term they use at The Circle for new employees, and she says she is. He says he could tell and pulls out a hidden bottle of liquor from a bush and offers to share it with Mae. They carry on a little conversation before he gets a prompt from his phone and tells Mae that he has to go and gives her the bottle of alcohol. The employee's name is Ty Lafitte (John Boyega), but he doesn't tell Mae his name.While home for the weekend, Mae is at a BBQ with her family and several other people. Her father, Vinnie Holland (Bill Paxton), has multiple sclerosis and has some difficulty performing normal day tasks without the help of his wife, Bonnie Holland (Glenne Headly). It is evident that Mae's parents like Mae's friend Mercer and would like to see Mae and Mercer back together. Vinnie asks Mae to grab him a beer from inside their house, clearly trying to arrange an interaction between her and Mercer. While inside the house, Mae and Mercer meet. They discuss Mercer's business, which is making deer antlers into chandeliers. The conversation doesn't last long, and Mae returns to her parents.Back at The Circle on Monday, two employees come to Mae and ask her about her profile on The Circle and why it isn't updated. They also noticed that she had been away from the campus all weekend and ask her why she didn't come back for all the activities. While they are careful not to make anything seem required, they are clearly trying to get Mae to open up more on her Circle profile and to become more engaged in the company. These employees find out about her dad's health condition and that Mae enjoys kayaking. After the two employees leave, Mae seems more determined to rise up in The Circle by fully embracing all of its social networking tools.At a presentation at The Circle, Tom introduces a political candidate who is making all of her communications transparent. Tom applauds this and speaks about how transparency brings accountability. Mae is in the crowd with Annie. Ty is also in the crowd, but in the back. Once the candidate is done talking, Ty leaves.During another late night party at The Circle, Mae again sees Ty glued to his phone. She approaches Ty and begins another conversation. Ty then takes her to a restricted area she should not be in and tells her that she can't tell anyone that he brought her to this area. He shows her an abandoned underground area and tells her that it's the future of The Circle. He says the plan is to keep all information on everyone in this area, not just the political candidate that said she would be fully transparent. From Ty's countenance, it is clear he does not like the direction of The Circle. It's at this time that Mae discovers that she's been talking to Ty Lafitte the whole time. She is incredibly embarrassed and is in awe of him because he is the creator of True You, a very popular Circle product. He then tells her that True You has been morphed into something that he did not intend and that he has taken a back seat at The Circle. He could have a lot of influence over the company like Eamon and Tom, but has chosen to remain in the shadows.Sometime later while speaking to her Mom, Bonnie shows Mae a chandelier that Mercer made. She takes a picture of it and shares it on her Circle profile. Unbeknownst to her, Mercer gets a lot of hate mail and death threats from people accusing him of murdering animals. Mercer, who lives off the technological grid, comes to The Circle and confronts Mae about what she did. Mae is horrified and asks Mercer if they can go somewhere else to talk about this because people have begun to gather around them and film the conversation on their phones. Despite Mae trying to tell him she didn't mean to hurt him, Mercer storms off.After this traumatic experience, Mae goes to the kayak shop late at night and sneaks onto the premises through a locked fence. She takes a kayak and heads out into the bay. The waters start to get rough, and fog is settling in. Mae starts to hear a fog horn of an approaching ship, but can't see where it is because of the fog and lack of light. The waves eventually flip Mae's kayak over, and as she is struggling to keep above the water, the coast guard comes to her rescue.The next day, she is in Eamon and Tom's office, explaining what happened. Eamon explains that SeeChange cameras caught her breaking into the kayak premises and also caught her in the water. Because of the cameras, Mae was able to be saved in her moment of desperation. He then asks her if there is anything she wants to confess, and she tells them that it's not the first time she's been in their office. Eamon then asks her how it feels to tell the truth, and she says it's liberating. Eamon and Tom then allude to a plan that they have for her.At the next company-wide meeting, Eamon introduces Mae on stage, and they talk about her experience of being rescued. She explains how transparency is good and states that she is going to be the first Circler who goes completely transparent. This involves wearing a small camera on her shirt while she is awake and exposing her whole life to everyone in the world. We see Annie in the audience and she is clearly worn out and not looking good. She looks resentfully at Mae and says under her breath that she is a natural.Being fully transparent has made Mae a celebrity at The Circle, but it starts to hurt some of her close relationships. One night, she is looking for her parents through the SeeChange cameras and accidentally finds them having sex. She quickly turns off away from the camera, but the damage is done. Everyone following Mae's transparency has seen the couple. Her parents go off the gird and distance themselves from Mae. When she is finally able to talk to them, they express that they love her, but being transparent is just too much for them.Mae is invited to a high-level board meeting, and Annie seems to resent it because someone of her level at the company isn't usually invited. At the meeting, Eamon talks about support from all 50 states to allow individuals to vote through Circle accounts. Mae then takes it one step further and brings up the idea of requiring every individual to have a Circle account. Eamon and Tom clearly like the suggestion, but it upsets Annie. Annie gets vocal about her disagreement and ends up storming out of the board meeting.At the next company-wide meeting, Mae is the leading the meeting and talks about the beauty of transparency. She then states that The Circle believes it can find anyone on the planet in under 20 minutes. She then has the computer randomly select a criminal at large for Circlers to find. The computer selects a woman who is guilty of killing her three children and was in prison, but escaped. Within 10 minutes, Circlers around the world have used phones, SeeChange cameras, and facial recognition software to find the woman and have her arrested. Mae talks about how wonderful transparency is and how it can be a tool for good.Mae then states that this program can be used to find anyone, not just criminals. She asks the audience who they should search for next and someone shouts Mercer's name. She says she wants to leave him alone, but the crowd gets restless. Mae is trying to dissuade the audience, but Tom tells her that they need to find Mercer and she eventually gives in and asks if they can break their record of 10 minutes. People eventually find Mercer in a cabin. There are multiple people surrounding his cabin, and they begin harassing him and asking him why he is an animal killer.Mercer races to his truck and tries to get away from the people tracking him. Mae and the rest of the Circlers are watching Mercer being chased through real-time cameras. As he is being chased, a drone startles him, and he reacts by jerking his steering wheel to the left to avoid the drone. However, he over-corrects and drives his truck off a bridge and dies immediately.Mae is horrified and takes a leave from The Circle and total transparency. She moves back in with her parents and is trying to cope. She eventually calls Annie, who has left The Circle and is out of the country. Annie seems to be doing a lot better. During the call, Mae actually tells Annie that connection to others has helped her cope with Mercer's death.Despite pleas from her parents, Mae decides to return to work at The Circle. As she is driving, she calls Ty and asks him for a favor. During their conversation, Ty tells her that she won't believe what he has found.At the next company-wide meeting, Mae expresses how connection has helped her recover. As she is speaking with Eamon on stage, she invites Tom onto the stage, and he seems very weary. Mae then talks about transparency and invites both Eamon and Tom to go fully transparent. As she is talking, she tells them how Ty has found all their accounts, even the accounts that their wives were unaware of, and is exposing them in an attempt to become fully transparent because no one should be exempt. Eamon and Tom are clearly upset but are trying to keep a good face. Eamon eventually turns to Tom and tells him, ""We are so fucked,"" and Tom walks off stage.Mae then states that transparency is good. To the support of all in the audience, Mae leaves the meeting. It is clear that she believes in transparency and that no one should be exempt from hiding their secrets.The movie ends with Mae kayaking again and untroubled by the flying drones around her. She has embraced transparency as an end to privacy."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4849438/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Amarendra Baahubali, the heir apparent to the throne of Mahishmati, finds his life and relationships endangered as his adoptive brother Bhallaladeva conspires to claim the throne. Kattappa narrates the story of Amarendra Baahubali to Shivudu, who learns his lineage as the prince of Mahishmati and the son of Amarendra Baahubali. Shivudu, now Mahendra Baahubali, decides to dethrone and punish Bhallaladeva for all wrongdoings of his past with the help of Kattappa. Upon listening to a narrative of his parents' love story and the treachery that led to his father's death, Shiva, the son of Bahubali, must claim his place as the rightful heir to the throne of the Mahishmati Kingdom, but first, he must avenge the injustice committed against his parents and people.—Santhosh Kattappa (Sathyaraj) continues to narrate how he ended up killing Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas).
After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of Mahishmati and Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati) is declared as the commander-in-chief. Before the coronation, Rajamatha Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) begins to look for a bride for Amarendra. She instructs Amarendra and Kattappa to tour the kingdom to understand its current state and its people.
Amarendra falls in love with Devasena (Anushka Shetty), a princess of the Kuntala kingdom (7.5 Yojanas in the North from Mahishmati) and the sister of the king of Kuntala. Bhallaladeva learns of Amarendra's attempts to woo Devasena and hatches a plot to drive a wedge between Amarendra and Sivagami by asking for Devasena's hand in marriage for himself. Sivagami, unaware that Amarendra is in love with Devasena, promises Devasena's hand in marriage to Bhallaladeva.Sivagami sends an emissary to the kingdom of Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronizing way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Sivagami is enraged to hear Devasena's response and sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.
The kingdom of Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a Dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal uncle, Kumara Varma (Subbaraju), is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Amarendra reveals who he is, promises Devasena that he will protect her honor no matter what and convinces her to come with him to Mahismati as his future bride.
Upon reaching Mahismati, the misunderstanding comes to light. When Sivagami delivers an ultimatum to Amarendra that he must either chose the throne or Devasena, he chooses Devasena. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During the coronation ceremony the citizens of Mahishmati clearly display their preference for Amarendra over Bhallaladeva.At Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva relieves Amarendra of his duties as commander-in-chief so that Amarendra can be with his wife. Devasena immediately speaks out against the King's manipulation and the mute inaction of Sivagami. Due to further clashes, Devasena and Amarendra are banished from the Palace. Amarendra and Devasena live happily among the people. Bhallaladeva notices that to the people, Amarendra is their king, and hatches a plot with his father Bijjaladeva (Nassar) to convince Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him. Bijjaladeva has a mock fight with Bhallaladeva where Bijjal tries to stop Bhalla from hatching a plot to kill Bahubali. The whole scene is witnessed by Kumara Varma. Bhalla throws Bijjala aside. Later, Kumara Varma meets Bijjala, and Bijjala convinces him to attack Bhalla to save Bahubali. Kumara Varma does, not knowing that he has walked into a trap & is killed by Bhalla. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat and open action would result in factions and civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.Kattappa learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami. Devasena too arrives to learn of her husband's death with her son, in her arms. Sivagami announces the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, is the new King.
As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with baby Mahendra Baahubali. Devasena is taken prisoner for the next 25 years. The Kuntala Kingdom is destroyed completely by Bhallaladeva. The now ousted Kuntala King (Meka Ramakrishna), leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against king Bhallaladeva.After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali alias Shivudu (Prabhas) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika (Tamannaah) and the people of the city. Bhallaladeva once again kidnaps Devasena and seals the palace, but Baahubali, ingenious like his father, manages to enter the palace to capture Bhallaladeva.Bijjala Deva tries to brainwash Kattappa reminding him of his forefather's pledge of their allegiance to protect and defend the throne of Mahismati and their duty to be loyal to the king. Kattappa reminds him that Sivagami had declared Mahendra Baahubali king before her death 25 years back and hence his loyalties instead lie with the rightful king, Baahubali. Bhallaladeva is later defeated by Baahubali and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena. Ending the cruel regime of Bhallaladeva, Baahubali becomes the new King of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen, declaring peace and harmony.
In the end credits, a child is heard asking an elder whether the son of Mahendra Baahubali will become the next king of Mahishmati. To which, the elder replies: ""Who knows what Lord Shiva is planning!"""

But with Baker's unique bike skills and Ponch's street savvy it might just work...if they don't drive each other crazy first.—Warner Bros. The driver in a robbery reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent named Castillo, and he arrests the criminal who killed his partner a few years ago.
Meanwhile, at the training center for the California Highway Patrol, an older rookie motorcycle officer named Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) is being allowed to graduate on a probationary basis. He is a former freestyle motocross racer beginning a new career after his body has been left damaged by his sport. He is on a regimen of pain killers and is living in the guest house, after he and his wife separated when he lost his sponsors. The evaluating officer decides to take sympathy on Baker's sob story and gives him a second chance to succeed, but he has to finish in the top 10 of his class to keep his job.
The FBI agent, now undercover as Frank (Ponch) Poncherello (Michael Peña), is sent to the CHP after an armored car robbery, which makes it apparent that there are corrupt cops working in the department (a police car blocked the freeway on which the armored car was travelling, making it easier for the robbers). He is partnered with the rookie Baker, who will be too inexperienced to understand the corruption investigation Ponch will be leading, but can ride a bike (since the robbers are on bikes, Frank's boss thinks Baker can help get undercover quickly).Frank is constantly irritated by the over active Baker, who keeps writing tickets for minor traffic offenses (as he wants to finish in the top 10). Frank does not want to attract attention and Baker is making it difficult to maintain a low profile.
The corrupt officers are seen being led by Lt. Ray Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is stealing the money from armored cars to get his heroin-addicted son out of Los Angeles. Ponch argues with his new partner over whether Baker's wife is unfaithful, while Baker gives Ponch unsolicited advice on what he perceives to be a sex addiction.Ponch insults Baker and later Baker saves his life when they are pursuing the robbery suspects.

This confirms the suspicion that it was an inside job. One witness overhead one robber say LT, which means lieutenant.Ponch & Baker are convinced that Ray is the man behind the robberies. Ponch confronts Ray, but doesn't have any evidence. He gets a call from his boss who informs him that a parallel investigating is underway by another agent, who is tracking the marked bills from one of the robberies and has the money being traced to a drug dealer's house.

Ponch is fired from the FBI when the suspect is killed during the chase. Bakes is seriously injured during the chase (Ray was made aware of the chase by his accomplices, so he took his hummer to rescue his son, but was enraged by seeing him dead and rammed his car into Baker).
Baker is hospitalized and his wife does not visit him once. Upon release, Poncho drops him home, only for Baker to see that his wife has sold the home.However, he is sworn into the CHP when he and Baker identify the dead suspect as Ray Kurtz' son.

Only the Brave,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3829920/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a group of elite firefighters who risk everything to protect a town from a historic wildfire. In 2007 Prescott, Arizona, Eric Marsh of the Prescott Fire Department is frustrated fighting forest fires when the Type 1 or ""Hotshot"" front line forest fire fighting crews from afar overrule his operational suggestions to his area's sorrow. To change that, Marsh gets approval from the Mayor to attempt to organize an unprecedented certified municipal-based Hotshot crew for Prescott. To that end, Marsh needs new recruits, which includes the young wastrel, Brendan McDonough, to undergo the rigorous training and qualification testing for the most dangerous of fire fighting duty. Along the way, the new team meets the challenge and the hailed Granite Mountain Hotshots are born. In doing so, all the men, especially McDonough, are changed as new experience and maturity is achieved in fire-forged camaraderie. All this is put to the test in 2013 with the notorious Yarnell Hill Fire that will demand efforts and sacrifices no one can ignore.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Knowing that his highly trained, Type-2 municipal fire-fighting team won't be the one in the front line if a fire threatens their town, the committed supervisor, Eric Marsh, pushes his crew to their limits. With determination, self-sacrifice, and the aid of Division Chief, Duane Steinbrink, Marsh's brotherhood of dedicated young men become the elite Granite Mountain Hotshots: a fully certified, Type-1 team of firefighters for the city of Prescott, Arizona. Before long, as the men yearn to prove their mettle, a bolt of dry lightning ignites a seemingly controllable wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona; but, Eric already knows that all fires are unpredictable. Now, a heroic group of nineteen selfless men rush in the mouth of the raging inferno, to protect the lives and homes that stand in the way of the rampaging, all-consuming flames, only to find themselves trapped in the heart of the exitless Yarnell Hill Fire. Will the world ever forget that fateful June of 2013?—Nick Riganas This movie opens up with what feels like a dream sequence in a forest with a wild fire going. Out of the forest, we see the outline of a bear on fire running towards the camera. After the bear runs by it flashes to the house of Eric Marsh (Josh Brolin) who is the superintendent of the local wildfire crew in Prescott, Arizona. He's getting all his supplies ready after being called to join in on stopping a wildfire near Phoenix. Eric's wife Amanda (Jennifer Connelly) is already in the kitchen and reminds him of a fight they had last night, and he apologizes before heading to the fire.Eric's crew is a second level crew also called ""deucers"" which means they can't go to the front lines of a wildfire. The crew is shown digging a line and burning up vegetation in an area so that if the fire gets there, it won't have more dry vegetation to fuel the fire further. Eric is greeted by a ""Hotshot"" crew which he offers some strategy to, and they tell him to ""do what duecers do best, which is nothing."" The hotshot crew doesn't listen to Eric's advice and the small town they were trying to protect ends up in flames with everyone trying to escape.Eric calls his friend Duane (Jeff Bridges) who was a former fire chief to help them get certified as a Hotshot crew. They are trying to become the first municipal hotshot crew in the US as most are at a state or federal level. At this point, we're introduced to Brendan ""Donut"" McDonough (Miles Teller) who is sitting on the couch with his friend smoking what I believe is methamphetamine or crack or something out of a glass pipe. While he's high, he gets a text that a girl he used to date is pregnant. Brendan goes to the restaurant she works at, and she tells him that it is his baby. He appears still high and says he wants to help out and she says she doesn't want him to be a part of their lives. After finishing talking to her, Brendan sees a car stereo in a jeep and tries to steal it. The cops are right across the street and arrest him. He gets bailed out by his mother who when they get home tells him she doesn't want him at the house.Brendan goes to the wildfire crews house with his resume to apply. One of the guys there knows him from EMT class and knows he's a screw-up, so he tells Brendan to go away. But Eric the Superintendent asks him to come into his office to apply anyways. Brendan tells him that he has a record and that he's now been clean for three months. Eric tells him they're going to take a run in a few minutes and he should see if he can keep up. The crew starts running up a mountain and Brendan is trailing behind. At the top of the mountain, Eric gives an impassioned speech telling new applicants what they're getting into. Meanwhile, Brendan still hasn't made it up the mountain. Back at the station, Eric asks another firefighter if Brendan is dead on the hill somewhere. But Brendan finally comes out of the woods dead tired and shows picture proof he made it to the top of the mountain. They hire him then.Duane gets Eric and the crew an audition to become a hotshot crew, and while they're out fighting a fire, Eric decides to stop a fire that the auditor questions. They get into an argument, and Eric sticks to his guns, and it works. But he's worried he upset the auditor and might not pass their audition. But Duane informs them the next day that they did pass, and the crew all celebrates. They call themselves the Granite Mountain Hotshots.Next, there's a series of fighting fire scenes mixed in with Brendan taking groceries over to his baby mama's house for their baby. After a few times dropping groceries off, she lets him meet the baby, and he apologizes for being a dirt-bag.While the boys are out fighting a fire, Eric's wife Amanda is driving late at night and gets into a car wreck where her truck rolls over after she fell asleep at the wheel. The next morning Eric gets home to see the truck totaled and Amanda giving a horse care lesson to some clients. After the clients leave Eric gets upset at her and yells at her, and she yells back about him not being around enough. She says she wants to start a family and he said that their deal was no kids. During this conversation, we find out that Eric and Amanda are both recovering addicts and we realize that's part of why Eric took a chance on Brendan.The hotshots continue to stop fires and Brendan is becoming more involved with his daughter and decides to ask Eric one night at the bar if he wouldn't mind giving a recommendation so Brendan could work as a structure firefighter and be home more. Eric yells at him and reminds him nobody would ever give him a chance as he did. They argue, and Eric leaves mad. On the drive home, Eric is fighting with Amanda who tells him he's being mean to Brendan because of his own issues. Eric gets mad and gets out of the car and walks away from Amanda who screams that she's losing him to the fires and that she wants to start a family with him but he's obsessed with his work. Eric goes to Duane's house and tells him he's in a bad spot with Amanda. Eric returns home and tells Amanda ""I'm Yours"" and that he's going to be home more.The next morning they're called to a wildfire in Yarnell. Eric tells his assistant on the drive there that he's gonna quit being superintendent so he can be home more and start a family As the crew arrives at the Yarnell fire they realize it's a bigger fire than they thought. They go on the far side of the fire and start to do a burn, and the water plane drops water on their burn, screwing up their tactics. As the fire grows, Brendan is sent down by Eric to be their weather watch out. The rest of the team starts to dig another line while Brendan warns them that the fire is moving fast towards them. Brendan has to get away from his spot and is helped out by one of the other teams who drive him out of the dangers of the fire. Eric and his team walk around the back of the mountain. Brendan gets back to camp safely and can hear the Hotshots crew on the radio talk about how they're trying to get back. But the fire catches up to them too fast, and they're stuck in its path. The guys all begin to burn a circle and try and create an area with no brush around them, so when the fire comes, it won't pick up when it gets to them. They all deploy their safety covers and all lay down as the fire gets ready to sweep over them. As they're under their covers, Eric remembers the bear on fire running towards him. The fire sweeps over them. Brendan is listening on the radio and finds out that all 19 of his crew members are burned to death. They pan back to Eric's house where Amanda is in a barn and begins to scream after hearing the news. She and all the other wives and families gather at a Junior high school cafeteria waiting to get official news about the guys. They are told there's one survivor, but they don't know who. Brendan walks in the gym, and when the wives see him, they all start crying cause they know their husbands are dead. Brendan walks out, and Amanda chases him and tells him she's happy he survived, and he shouldn't feel guilty.The ending credits show all the pictures of the 19 who died, and we're told it was the largest single loss of firefighter life in the US since 9/11."
Call Me by Your Name,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5726616/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1980s Italy, romance blossoms between a seventeen-year-old student and the older man hired as his father's research assistant. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, the new film by Luca Guadagnino, is a sensual and transcendent tale of first love, based on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman. It's the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 17-year-old young man, spends his days in his family's 17th-century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.—Sony Pictures Classics In early-1980s northern Italy, amid the lush Mediterranean landscapes of a serene and golden summer, seventeen-year-old Elio visits the family's summer villa to spend his vacation. But, apart from his father and Greco-Roman culture professor, Mr Perlman, and his translator mother, Annella, the twenty-four-year-old American doctoral student, Oliver, is working there as an intern. Now, against the backdrop of incurable summer ennui, little by little, over the course of six ephemeral weeks, a timid friendship between Elio and Oliver will prepare the ground for an unexpected bond, as the unexplored emotions of first love start boiling over. Could this sun-kissed romance in Lombardy be the prelude to maturity?—Nick Riganas The Perlmans own a villa outside of Moscazzano in Northern Italy, where they spend their summers and Hannukah. They invite a graduate student to spend six weeks with them over the summer to help Professor Perlman with his work. This summer - 1983 - the student in question is an American named Oliver. While there, Oliver largely associates with the Perlmans' seventeen year old son Elio and Elio's friends, the females among the group whose hearts are aflutter by Oliver's preppy good looks. Oliver, in fact, takes up casually with one of them, Chiara. Elio is an intellectual, but has no experience with girls as he is only now experimenting with his initial stage of manhood and masculinity. If not for Oliver, Elio probably would have chosen Chiara himself, and as such takes up with Marzia instead. Despite their social association and sleeping in adjoining rooms in the villa, Elio doesn't much like Oliver in thinking him too cocky and arrogant partly in that brash American sensibility. In turn, Oliver believes Elio is patronizing in his outward dislike of him. These outward behaviors mask the fact that there is a deep attraction between Elio and Oliver based largely on their admiration of the other's intellect. When they eventually admit that attraction late into Oliver's stay, Oliver is more reticent to act on those feelings in not wanting to ruin his own or Elio's life in still being in the closet, while Elio wants to experience all that sex and love are as he is in the flush of first real love. With Oliver and Elio's clandestine relationship, Elio has to figure out what to do about Marzia, he who may be aware or unaware of her own very deep feelings for him in also experiencing that flush of first love. The other question then becomes if Elio will be able to recover as there will definitely be an end at least to this phase of Oliver and Elio's romance when Oliver leaves to go home at the end of the summer.—Huggo It's the summer of 1983, and precocious 17-year-old Elio Perlman is spending the days with his family at their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father.

In the summer of 1983, somewhere in northern Italy, seventeen-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is living with his parents (Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar).

Elio gives up his room so Oliver can stay in there.With not much else to do, the two begin spending time together, with Elio showing Oliver around. The cerebral Elio finds gregarious Oliver to be arrogant - he doesn't like him very much.

Amidst a wild flat meadow encircled by an Edenic lush forest, a couple have cocooned themselves in a secluded mansion that was not so long ago burned to the ground, devotedly restored by the supportive wife. Within this safe environment, the once famous middle-aged poet husband is desirous of creating his magnum opus; however, he seems unable to break out of the persistent creative rut that haunts him. Then, unexpectedly, a knock at the door, the sudden arrival of a cryptic late-night visitor and his intrusive wife will stimulate the writer's stagnant imagination.

While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay.

Father Figures,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1966359/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Upon learning that their mother has been lying to them for years about their allegedly-deceased father, fraternal twin brothers hit the road to search for him. Kyle and Peter Reynolds are fraternal twins who were raised by their mother, Helen, as their father died before they were born. Kyle has a pregnant girlfriend, Kaylani, and is wealthy from royalties for his image on BBQ sauce labels. Peter is divorced with a teenage son who resents him. Shortly after Helen's wedding, Peter recognizes an actor on ""Law and Order: SVU"" from photos of his supposed father, and confronts Helen. Helen explains that she had been promiscuous at the time of their conception and did not want their father involved. When they keep pressing, Helen reveals that their father is Terry Bradshaw. The brothers fly to Florida to meet Bradshaw at a signing event. Bradshaw is excited to have them as sons. As Bradshaw recounts stories with former teammate Rod Hamilton, the brothers realize that Bradshaw had been in Australia at the time of their conception, and thus isn't their father.. In middle age, fraternal twin brothers Peter and Kyle Reynolds could not be more different. Divorced Peter is uptight by nature. He realizes that he is unhappy with his life: he hasn't been with anyone since his divorce three years ago--from his college sweetheart and the only woman he had even been with, Katherine; he and his teenage son Ethan have never gotten along; he doesn't really like being a proctologist and had only become one to honor the supposed father who had died of colon cancer before he and Kyle were born. Ex-surfer Kyle is a free spirit living in Hawai'i, off the lucrative royalties from his image being used for a commercial Hawaiian barbecue sauce in the latest item in what seems to be his charmed life. He has never been married and is currently in a serious relationship with equally free spirit Kaylani. At the wedding of their mother Helen--her first since their father's passing, Peter and Kyle discover by chance that the stories Helen had told them about their father for all these years were all lies: she doesn't actually know who their father is. Peter is arguably more devastated by this news as it was on what he based his life. With what little Helen tells them, Peter and Kyle go on a quest to find their father: a journey of discovery about the list of ""candidates"", but also about their mother, their twin relationship, and themselves.—Huggo Peter Reynolds (Ed Helms) is a physician who spends his days performing rectal exams on his patients. He's also divorced and his son Ethan (Zachary Haven) has little respect for him.Peter takes Ethan to attend the wedding of his mother Helen Baxter (Glenn Close). Peter's twin brother Kyle (Owen Wilson) is there with his pregnant girlfriend Kaylani (Jessica Gomes). Peter resents Kyle for living frivolously due to receiving royalties for including his image on bottles of hot sauce.After the ceremony, Peter is watching an episode of the TV show ""Law and Order"" when he notices one of the actors looks familiar to him. After being told that their father died of colon cancer (which is what drove Peter to pick the job he has now), he suspects that his father may actually still be alive because the actor on the show has a birthmark similar to what Helen told the guys their dad had. Helen eventually admits that she lied about their father because she felt that their real dad wasn't fit enough to raise them. After Peter angrily presses Helen for more information, she relents and says their dad could be Terry Bradshaw. Peter gets excited because he idolized Terry growing up. Knowing he lives in Miami, Peter and Kyle make a trip to go find him.On the plane ride to Miami, Kyle tries to play matchmaker for Peter with a stewardess. Peter is hesitant despite not being in a relationship with anyone since his ex-wife. Kyle wants to make it a side goal on their trip for Peter to get laid.The brothers go to a stadium where Terry is having a meet-and-greet. Peter takes out a picture of Helen and shows it to Terry, leading him to reminisce fondly (and sexually) about Helen, which causes him to believe he really is Peter and Kyle's father. Terry invites them to his house and later plays catch on the beach with Peter. When Kyle is thrown the ball, he runs to catch but gets knocked on his ass by Terry's friend Rod Hamilton (Ving Rhames). He also has pleasant, steamy memories of Helen. When Peter mentions a trip that Helen supposedly went on with Terry to Australia around the time of the guys' conception, Terry mentions that she never went with her, so he couldn't be their father. Terry and Rod mention a man that Helen later dated named Roland Hunt (J.K. Simmons), whom Rod thinks Peter resembles.Peter and Kyle head off to find Roland. While outside his house, Roland approaches them with a gun, thinking they are burglars. He drops it when the guys mention Helen. Roland invites them inside with his wife (June Squibb). When the guys mention they might be his sons, Roland goes into the kitchen and goes nuts at the thought of being their dad. After calming down, Roland goes to the guys and asks them for help with something.The three go to the home of a wealthy neighbor because Roland wants to steal his Ferrari. The man and his wife go outside to see this happening, and Roland runs off to leave Peter and Kyle. However, Roland has a change of heart and goes back for them, only to get hit when the guys actually try to make off with the Ferrari.The guys take Roland to the hospital. The doctors tell them that after a blood transfusion, they found that Roland's blood type does not match the guys, meaning he can't be their father. The guys go into Roland's room to apologize for what happened. He tells them he realized he couldn't be their father because around the time that they were conceived, he was in jail after another one of Helen's boyfriends, ""Sparkly P"", ratted Roland out for possessing cocaine. The guys figure Sparkly P could be their real dad.While driving to find the man, the guys encounter a hitchhiker (Katt Williams). They pick him up and head to the man's destination, only for their car to get stranded in the middle of nowhere at night. Peter and Kyle start to argue, with Peter resenting Kyle for why he thinks his life sucks. Moments later, a train starts to approach, and they are sitting on the train tracks. Peter gets the hitchhiker out, but Kyle is stuck in the car. The train collides with the car, and Peter fears that Kyle is dead until he emerges from the distance and runs to Peter. They hug until Kyle punches Peter in the face for leaving him there.The police and medics arrive to tend to the guys. Kyle mentions to Peter that he has been dropped by the hot sauce company and is being replaced by a dog. After the cops clear the guys to go home, Peter mentions Sparkly P, and the cops recognize that name because Sparkly P, better known as Patrick O'Callaghan, was a former respected cop. One of the cops gives the guys his last known address for them to find him.The guys stop at a hotel for the night. Peter goes to the bar and sees a crying woman named Sarah (Katie Aselton).

She finds him charming, and the two later go to her room to have sex.In the morning, the guys head over to the O'Callaghan house to see a party going on. However, they soon find out it's a wake, as Patrick is dead. The guys are disappointed to find out that their potential dad is gone. Patrick's daughter goes up to make a speech, and Peter is mortified to see that it's Sarah, leading him to believe he slept with his sister. He runs out of the house, accidentally spilling a drink on one of Patrick's son's girlfriends. The sons start to fight Peter and Kyle outside until Patrick's twin brother Kevin (Jack McGee) comes out to break things up. The guys mention they are Helen's sons, and Kevin sends everyone else inside to sort things out. After sitting Peter, Kyle, and Patrick's children together, Kevin says that Patrick could not have been the guys' father, because he and Helen never had sex. They were to marry, and Patrick wanted to consummate afterwards, but she ran off with the man she truly loved, Walter Tinkler (Christopher Walken).Peter and Kyle go to find Walter, who is a doctor and actually lives closer to their home. When Walter sees them and learns whose kids they are, he tries to run for it until Kyle hits him with a tranquilizer dart.Helen arrives after hearing what's been happening. She finally confesses the truth to Peter and Kyle - she was never their biological mother. The guys' true mother was a young woman who Helen met when she worked at a clinic when the woman was six months pregnant with the boys. She went into labor early, and Helen managed to help her deliver Peter and Kyle, but their mother did not survive. Helen started the adoption process, and while Walter was in love with her, he couldn't uproot his life for someone else's babies. Although Kyle feels frustrated at this revelation at first, Peter comforts him with the fact that they were still raised by a great lady like Helen. The guys then hug Helen.Peter and Kyle part ways at the airport more amicably than they have been before.One year later, Peter is in Hawaii with Ethan, who now respects his dad more, and Sarah, whom Peter is dating. Kyle and Helen are also there with Kyle's twin children. It is also revealed that Peter and Kyle have launched their own app for users to receive helpful messages from the universe, which are recorded by none other than the hitchhiker."

Detroit,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5390504/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Fact-based drama set during the 1967 Detroit riots in which a group of rogue police officers respond to a complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds. A police raid in Detroit in 1967 results in one of the largest RACE riots in United States history. The story is centred around the Algiers Motel incident, which occurred in Detroit, Michigan on July 25, 1967, during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. It involves the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people: seven black men and two white women. The true story of one of the most terrifying moments during the civil unrest that rocked Detroit in the summer of '67. Amidst the chaos of the Detroit Rebellion, with the city under curfew and as the Michigan National Guard patrolled the streets, three young African American men were murdered at the Algiers Motel. 50 years after the events of July 25th, 1967, the question remains: what happened at the motel?—Annapurna Pictures The race riots that occurred in the predominantly black Victoria Park neighborhood of Detroit in late July, 1967 are presented. The riots began on July 23 following a raid on an unlicensed after hours black club serving liquor in celebration for just returned black soldiers from the war. The confrontation between the black populace of the neighborhood and police escalated with increasing action on both sides, those actions including burning and looting in the neighborhood on the public side, and the setting of curfews and calling in the National Guard to assist by Michigan Governor George Romney. The movie focuses on a situation on the evening of July 25 in the Algiers Motel, where the authorities, led by the Detroit Police Department, were searching for a supposed sniper firing at the authorities, the motel which should have been a place of sanctuary away from riots happening outside the motel walls. The individuals at the motel that evening include the following. White DPD Officer Phillip Krauss has his own moral stance where he will do whatever required to exact his form of justice, which included the day before mortally shooting a black looter in the back as he was running away unarmed. That incident the day before colors the way Krauss now handles such confrontations. A singular white National Guardman on the scene knows the volatility of the situation based on the patrolmen's actions, but does whatever he can to keep those being interrogated alive while not stepping on the toes of the police. Melvin Dismukes is a black part-time security guard who does whatever he can to diffuse the situation all in an effort for the black populace to survive whatever given situation at the time. Larry 'Cleveland' Reed, the lead singer for the Dramatics, and his friend Fred Temple took refuge at the motel after a gig which could have been the Dramatics big break was canceled at the last minute due to the riots, which left them outside after curfew. Carl Cooper, a resident at the motel, wanted white people to feel the fear black people felt every day at the hands and more specifically guns of the police. Greene, a black man, is a recently decommissioned soldier, who is solely in Detroit trying to find a job. And Julie Ann and Karen are two young white women from Ohio staying at the motel, they who have no issue in partying with the predominantly black residents and other guests at the motel.—Huggo On July 23, 1967, the Detroit Police Department staged a raid on an unlicensed club during a celebration for returning black veterans from the Vietnam War. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor George W. Romney authorizes the Michigan Army National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson authorizes Army paratroopers to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges. The film opens with an animation and text depicting the Great Migration during World War I. After World War II, African Americans had been moved to segregated communities, including Detroit, which contained a mostly white police force. Change was inevitable. It was only a matter of how, and when.Detroit, 1967A party is being held in a speakeasy for a couple of G.I.'s returning from the Vietnam War. All the guests are African American. Police raid the place due to the place not having a valid liquor license. They bring the guests out into the streets to make their arrests public, leading to a crowd of angry African American onlookers to begin protesting. Once all the guests have been rounded up, one man throws a glass bottle at an officer. Some people in the crowd then proceed to rob a store, thus beginning the 12th Street riots.Congressman John Conyers (Laz Alonso) addresses the citizens in his community to try and handle the situation involving the police.The National Guard arrives to patrol the streets of Detroit as the riots continue. One little girl looks out her window to see what is happening. An officer mistakes her for a sniper, leading to the other men to blast through the window.Three patrolmen - Krauss (Will Poulter), Flynn (Ben O'Toole), and Demens (Jack Reynor) - drive through the streets as the chaos is happening. They find one black man, named Leon (Tyler James Williams), stealing from a grocery store. Krauss and Flynn chase after Leon. Krauss aims his shotgun at Leon and shoots him in the side. Leon manages to hop a fence and make it to the home of a woman down the street from his house. He lays under her car and asks the woman to get his wife. Police later find Leon dead.Krauss' superior, Detective Tanchuck (Darren Goldstein), meets with him following the incident with Leon. Tanchuck chastises Krauss for using a gun on an unarmed individual. Krauss tries to play it up by saying MAYBE Leon killed someone during the robbery.Security officer Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) watches as an officer harasses an African American teenager. Dismukes goes over to pretend the boy is his nephew to help him on his way home. The boy makes rude remarks to Dismukes, who hits back that if he were to try anything, the other officers would be all over him.Meanwhile, a young man named Fred (Jacob Latimore) arrives at a theater to join his group, The Dramatics, who are performing after Martha and the Vandellas. The guys are eager to perform before the equally excited crowd, only for an officer to show up to tell the manager that they need to evacuate everyone due to the rioting going on outside. Despite the group's protest, everyone is forced to leave. The group's lead singer, Larry (Algee Smith), starts to sing by himself onstage with nobody but Fred to listen to him.Larry and Fred ride a bus and head to the Algiers Motel to stay the night. They are placed in a room by the annex. They go to the pool where they meet two white women, Julie (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever). Larry proceeds to flirt with Julie. The ladies invite the guys to another room.Upon entering the room, the guys meet Carl (Jason Mitchell), Lee (Peyton Alex Smith), and Aubrey (Nathan Davis, Jr.). Carl is dismissive of Larry and Fred. Larry starts to hook up with Julie while Carl cooks hot dogs. They proceed to discuss the ongoing situation in the streets and how the police are dealing with other African Americans. Carl takes out a small pistol and pretends to interrogate Lee. Lee appears nervous and tries to grab the gun from Carl, only for Carl to shoot him. Everyone freaks out, only for Lee and Carl to start laughing, as it was a toy gun. Larry, Fred, and the ladies all go back to their rooms.Carl sees police officers a few streets down. He intends to scare them with the gun. He shoots in their direction, leading the police to panic and think they are being fired upon. The police and a few sergeants head down to the Algiers and start firing into the rooms before the patrolmen enter the motel. Carl tries to run, only to get shot by Krauss. Krauss then plants a knife next to Carl as he bleeds out and dies. When Dismukes shows up to the scene, Krauss lies and says that Carl tried to attack him with the knife while trying to go for his gun.The patrolmen round up Larry, Fred, Aubrey, Lee, Julie, Karen, and another man named Greene (Anthony Mackie). The officers force them up against the wall to get them to say who shot at them, who has the gun, and where it is. Everyone is scared and all of them deny knowing anything about the gun. Krauss and Flynn begin to brutally beat the black men while Flynn hits Julie in the head with the butt of his rifle. Krauss leads the interrogation and orders everyone to start praying. He takes Lee into the room with the threat of shooting him if he doesn't tell them what they want to hear. Krauss fires a round next to Lee's head and orders him to stay still and be quiet, or the next shot is for real. A sergeant does the same with Greene.Michigan state police show up as this goes on. They decide to let the patrolmen take this case.Krauss and Flynn grab Julie, Karen, and Greene to interrogate them in another room. Julie is constantly accused of being a prostitute, and Greene is accused of being a pimp. Greene says he is a veteran from the Vietnam War, though Krauss continues trying to disprove this even after Green shows him his card.The officers are alerted to commotion going on from outside. Larry and Fred attempt to escape, only to find more officers and sergeants approaching, forcing them to return to the wall. When the officers return, Krauss lets Demens take Aubrey into a room to play their little game. However, Demens isn't aware that this was a game, and he shoots Aubrey for real. Krauss comes in and sees this and becomes worried. He tells Demens to come up with a story of how Aubrey reached for his gun. They then get Larry and tell him he can leave if he never speaks of what he saw. Larry runs away without a word. Fred is brought in next, but when he doesn't comply with Krauss, he shoots Fred twice before Flynn blasts him with a shotgun. Meanwhile, a sergeant lets Lee get away.Larry runs until he comes by another police officer, who sees how banged up he is. The man helps Larry into his squad car and takes him to the hospital.In the aftermath of the motel incident, Aubrey's family is informed of his death. His father gathers his son's belongings and heads to the morgue to identify Aubrey's body.Dismukes is found by police at his warehouse job and brought in for questioning since he has been named a suspect in the motel incident. Two racist police detectives, Thomas (Chris Coy) and Jones (Dennis Staroselsky), interrogate him and suggest he used his revolver to carry out the murders. Dismukes provides a contradictory account of that night, and he is briefly incarcerated.At the police station, Demens and Flynn admit to Tanchuck over what really went down at the motel. When Tanchuck is ready to talk to Krauss, he tries to get away, only for Tanchuck to find him and threaten him.The Dramatics visit Larry in the hospital. Fred's brother is there to ask what happened to Fred. Larry confirms the police most likely killed Fred.Meanwhile, Krauss is being interrogated by Thomas and Jones over the incident, but he is pulled out by his attorney, Auerbach (John Krasinski).The patrolmen are put on trial for the incident. The surviving victims all give testimonies and directly place blame on the officers involved. Auerbach presses everyone at the stand, leading at least one of them to get angry and shout obscenities. The racist, all-white jury finds the patrolmen not guilty of assault or murder. The result is enough to make Dismukes vomit.The Dramatics get a record deal, but Larry no longer wants any part of it after all he's been through. He takes a small job as a church choir director since all the clubs in the area are patrolled by officers. Larry is then seen directing the choir.The final text states that Melvin Dismukes left Detroit following multiple death threats, and he has worked security for places like Sears Roebuck. The three officers were found not guilty, but a case was filed against one of them and they were forced to pay a $5,000 settlement to the family of Aubrey Pollard. Fred Temple's family sued the city of Detroit for a wrongful death, though the city would not admit guilt. Carl Cooper's gun was never found. Julie Ann Hysell never returned to Detroit. She now has four children and works as a hairdresser. The Dramatics continue to perform to this day, but Larry Cleveland Reed never rejoined the group. He still works as a choir director."
The Case for Christ,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6113488/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An investigative journalist and self-proclaimed atheist sets out to disprove the existence of God after his wife becomes a Christian. An award-winning investigative journalist -- and avowed atheist -- who applies his well-honed journalistic and legal skills to disprove the newfound Christian faith of his wife... with unexpected, life-altering results. In 1980, atheist and investigative journalist Lee Strobel applies his journalistic and legal skills to attempt to disprove his wife Leslie's newfound Christian faith, which creates a rift within his marriage. After completing a thorough investigation for almost two years he finds the historical evidence for Jesus, and then finds a new faith in Christ.. 'Based on a true story'.In 1980, Lee Strobel (Mike Vogel) is an award-winning investigative journalist for the Chicago Tribune, who has just been commended for his work on investigating the Ford Pinto fires. One night, Lee, his pregnant wife Leslie (Erika Christensen) and their young daughter, Alison, are out to dinner when Alison begins choking on a gumball. A nurse named Alfie (L. Scott Caldwell) comes to Alison's aid. After helping Alison spit the gumball out, Leslie thanks her for saving her daughter. Alfie replies that it wasn't her, but it was Jesus that saved her. Alfie explains that she is a nurse at the local hospital and that she and her husband were supposed to go to another restaurant that night, but she got a feeling that she was supposed to come to the restaurant that they were at that night.Later that night, Alison asks her mom and dad about who Jesus is. Leslie tries to explain it to her, but Lee says that Jesus is a story that a lot of people tell like the storybooks that he reads to her at night. After Alison goes to sleep, Leslie tells Lee that she thought that they weren't going to force their beliefs onto Alison and that they were going to let her make up her own mind. Lee doesn't want to go into it, and they let it go.The next day, Leslie goes to see Alfie to thank her again, and Alfie invites Leslie to her church. Leslie goes, and after the service, she talks with Alfie in her car. Alfie asks Leslie about Lee and what he believes. Leslie says that Lee only believes ""in the facts."" Leslie goes to Alfie's church again on another night, and when she gets home, she tells Lee that she went to see Alfie the other day to thank her and that Alfie invited her to her church and that she went. Lee says that he wishes he could have been there to see that. Leslie tells him that she wanted to go and that she went again and that time, she says that she felt something more real than anything she's ever felt in her life. After hearing that, Lee storms off and tells his wife that he's going out to file a missing persons report, to which Leslie replies that that is not funny. Lee says it is not meant to be.Lee decides to put his investigative skills to the test to prove that Christianity is a hoax. He talks to Religion reporter, Kenny London (Mike Pniewski), who tells Lee that the Christian faith hinges on the resurrection of Jesus Christ and that if that were proven to be false, then everything would fall like a house of cards. So, Lee goes and sets up an unused room in the basement of the Tribune to gather evidence to disprove the resurrection of Jesus.Lee goes to talk with a leading expert on the resurrection. The man tells Lee that there are around 500 people who testified that they saw Jesus alive weeks after He was killed. After the meeting, Lee gets paged by Leslie, who has gone into labor and has given birth to their son, Kyle.During this time, Lee is also investigating a shooting between a cop, Joe Koblinsky, and a young black man, James Dixon. Lee goes to see Koblinsky in the hospital, but Koblinsky won't talk to him, except to tell Lee to write a story that will put Dixon away for a long time. Lee finds out that Koblinsky has arrested Dixon over a half dozen times previously and has concluded that Dixon is Koblinsky's informant. Lee meets with another cop to try to get confirmation that Dixon is Koblinsky's informant. The cop confirms Lee's suspicions and Lee runs the story.Meanwhile, Lee meets with an agnostic psychologist, Dr. Roberta Waters (Faye Dunaway). Lee presents her with his idea that maybe the 500 people who saw Jesus alive after He was crucified, maybe they were seeing a hallucination. Dr. Waters says that a mass hallucination where 500 people saw the same exact thing and/or person, would be an even bigger miracle than the Resurrection itself. Dr. Waters asks Lee about his relationship with his father, Walter (Robert Forster). Dr. Waters asks Lee if his father was cold and distant towards him growing up. Lee says that he was. Dr. Waters tells Lee that all of the most well-known atheists (e.g. Sigmund Freud) all had a father that either died when they were young or were abusive in some way towards them. She calls it a ""father wound.""After Lee's story, regarding Dixon being an informant, is published, Dixon is sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty. At the trial, Lee asks Dixon why he pled guilty since earlier in the film, Dixon told Lee that he was innocent. Dixon tells Lee it was because his story left him no choice. Koblinsky goes to see Lee after the trial and thanks him for the story that he wrote. Lee sees that Koblinsky's arm is in a sling. Koblinsky tells Lee that it is because he still has bullet fragments in his spleen.Lee starts to think about that and looks at the crime scene photos of Koblinsky's wound. He talks with Dixon's attorney, and they go to the evidence lockup to look at the evidence taken from the scene. Lee notices that if Koblinsky got shot and had bullet fragments from his spleen, he would have been shot from a downward angle. Lee sees another photo of Koblinsky with a pen in his pocket. Lee finds the pen among the evidence and opens it to find a homemade pen gun, with a bullet casing inside. The casing matches the bullet extracted from Koblinsky. Dixon's attorney explains that pen guns are illegal for a police officer to carry. They conclude that Koblinsky's pen gun went off in his shirt pocket and instead of admitting that it was because of the pen gun, Koblinsky reported that Dixon shot him.Lee goes to his editor (Frankie Faison) to explain that Koblinsky played him. His editor tells Lee that he let himself be played and has risked the reputation of the paper and a retraction has to be printed now. Lee tells his editor that he is going to be taking a few personal days off. During these personal days off, Leslie gets baptized. Angry, Lee goes and gets drunk. When he comes home, he gets into an argument with Leslie and ends up yelling at Alison. Later on, he goes to apologize to Alison, but she ignores him, feeling heartbroken.The next morning, Lee gets onto a plane to Los Angeles where he goes to consult with a medical doctor about if Jesus did die on the cross or if he just passed out and people assumed he died. Lee talks to Dr. Alexander Metherell (Tom Nowicki), and the doctor calls Lee's theory rubbish. Dr. Metherell asks Lee if he knows what happens in the flogging that Jesus endured. Lee assumes it is just a whipping with a lash. Dr. Metherell explains that a flogging was a brutal beating with a spiked weapon that would have left Jesus in near-critical condition from blood loss. Then being nailed to the cross, He would have had to lift himself up repeatedly, in order to draw his next breaths, since his chest was constricted and would die from asphyxiation if He did not do so, which is what He does eventually die from.Then, after He is dead, when He is stabbed in the side by a Roman guard, Jesus bled water and blood, which is proof that He died from asphyxiation. Dr. Metherell says that if Lee doesn't believe him, would he believe the opinion of the American Medical Association, which Lee says he would. Dr. Metherell hands Lee a copy of an issue of the American Medical Association Journal, which states that conclusive evidence has shown and has been proven that Jesus Christ did die on the cross.Shortly after Lee leaves the meeting, Leslie calls him to tell him that his father has passed away. Lee goes to the funeral and afterward, goes to his parents' home. He looks through his father's wallet and finds an article that was written about Lee joining the Tribune. When his mother walks in, Lee asks her if she knew he had that in his wallet. She says that he did. She hands Lee a photo album with cutouts of all of Lee's articles since he was writing for his school paper. She tells Lee that even though he didn't show it, his father did care about him. Lee heads home from the funeral with his family, when he hears the news that Dixon was beaten up in prison and that he is in critical condition at the hospital. Lee goes to see him at the hospital and apologizes to him for what he and his story did. Dixon tells Lee that it was because he (Lee) did not want to see the truth.Lee goes back to the office. At the end of the night, as most everyone has gone home, Lee berates Kenny for being a Christian. Kenny rebuffs Lee saying that Lee is supposed to be this hot-shot, golden boy reporter and yet is having trouble accepting the facts when his job is all about reporting the facts. Kenny tells him to suck it up and report the facts. Lee goes downstairs to his reporting room and looks over all the notes from all the interviews that he has done about the resurrection. Finally, he accepts the truth, saying ""Okay, God. You win.""Lee goes home and talks to Leslie, telling her that when she became a Christian, he freaked out and made it his mission to disprove her faith. He tells her that God did not give up on him and neither did she. He tells her that he believes too. They hug, and he prays to God. Three months later, Lee goes to talk to his editor to pitch him an idea for an article on his (Lee's) journey from atheist to believer, but his editor does not agree to it since it would jeopardize the credibility of the paper. Later on, Lee tells Leslie about it, and Leslie recommends that Lee write a book about it.In the final scene, Lee goes to his typewriter and titles the book ""The Case for Christ.""The epilogue shows that Lee became a best-selling author and that both his children have become the writers of Christian books too. Lee is now a professor, living in Texas and travels to different places, sharing the story of his journey."

When Clare comes home, she goes into the attic to find Johanna hanging herself.Teenage Clare (now played by Joey King) wakes up from this nightmare. She gets ready to go to school. Clare rides her bike to school and sees her Uncle August (Victor Sutton), whom her father won't let her speak to for some reason. Clare is distracted and nearly gets struck by popular girl Darcie Chapman (Josephine Langford). Clare just scrapes her knee and rips her legging.When Clare gets to school, she sees her father Jonathan (Ryan Phillipe) dumpster-diving with his friend Carl (Kevin Hanchard).

Darcie also takes an opportunity to be a bitch and hit Clare with her drink.Back home, Clare returns to see her dad has found a large music box. Clare takes it inside and reads that the box will grant seven wishes. She scoffs it off.The next day, Clare is at school with June and Meredith when they are giggling as Darcie and her clique of mean girls walk by. Darcie questions Clare as to why she's laughing, and Clare says that she called Darcie ""ultimate smegma"", which is some kind of genital secretion in both males and females. Darcie smacks Clare, who smacks her back. Clare then gets knocked over, and she retaliates by tackling Darcie to the ground and engaging in a girl fight.When Clare goes home, she takes the music box and makes what she thinks is a hypothetical wish for Darcie to ""go rot"".The following morning, after an apparently crazy party in her home, Darcie wakes up to find part of her hands, feet, and face looking grotesquely rotted. The news spreads around the school that Darcie got necrotizing facilities from a spa, and that means Clare's wish has come true. However, the next morning, Clare goes to look for Max and finds his dead body under the deck in the house. She and Jonathan bury their dog.After spending a good part of her day pining for Paul, Clare decides to make her second wish be that Paul would fall madly in love with her. When she goes to school again, Paul approaches her and shows clear interest, even in front of his girlfriend Lola Sanchez (Daniela Barbosa).In Uncle August's home, the old man is preparing to take a bath. He fills his tub with water and steps in, only to clumsily slip and hit his head on the side of the tub. He regains consciousness, only to bang his head on the nozzle and die.Upon learning of August's death, Clare wonders to her father if August left his inheritance to anyone. Jonathan doubts he or Clare would have been mentioned. Considering that they aren't very financially stable at the moment, Clare goes to her room and tells the music box her third wish, which is that August had left her everything.Clare wakes up the next day to Jonathan telling her that August apparently left Clare his entire inheritance. Soon, the two move into a mansion and start driving flashy cars.

She drops something down the garbage disposal and sticks her hand in there while precariously leaning close to the switch. Meanwhile, her pots on the stove appear to be burning. Mrs. Deluca pulls her hand out and turns off the stove. She then moves back toward the sink. Her ponytail goes down the disposal and she accidentally turns it on, causing the disposal to yank her hair and break her neck.Clare is still annoyed that her dad goes dumpster-diving for knick-knacks. She uses her fourth wish for Jonathan to be less embarrassing. Jonathan then becomes a smooth saxophone player that even Clare's friends find hot.Clare asks her friend Ryan Hui (Ki Hong Lee) for help in figuring out the phrase on the music box, as well as its history. They visit his cousin Gina (Alice Lee) in her loft. They find that the box has been passed down for decades, but they cannot translate the phrase. Gina sends the phrase to someone for an answer.That night, Gina is alone in her loft when she receives an email with the translation. She says it's messed up and it starts to freak her out. She tries to call Ryan outside but he doesn't answer the phone. The door behind her slams and causes her to drop her phone. She goes back inside as the power is out. In the darkness, she trips and falls face-first onto a the horn of a bull statue.At school, Clare is now Paul's girlfriend, but all of his friends don't care to hang out with her since Paul dumped Lola for her.

She leaves Paul.Ryan finds Gina's phone on the ground and runs up to her loft to find her dead. He finds Clare at school and tells her that he learned the phrase on the box translates to ""When the music ends, the blood price is paid."" He tells Clare that Gina is dead. Ryan also tells Clare that he's learned more about the box's history. Those who have used it all ended up dead. He refers to a man (Jerry O'Connell) who used the box's wishes to make his life better, only for his wife and children to perish. He burned his house down with himself and the box inside, but the box survived. Clare and Ryan do what they can to destroy the box themselves (burning it, hitting it with sledgehammers, etc), but nothing works.Clare goes to Mrs. Deluca's home and enters to a horrible smell. She then finds Mrs. Deluca's dead body still lingering by the sink.Clare tells June and Meredith about the box and how she's been making wishes.

Sarah tearfully tells Travis he can let go now, comforting him as he dies.

Battle of the Sexes,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4622512/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of the 1973 tennis match between World number oneBillie Jean Kingand ex-champ and serial hustlerBobby Riggs. In the wake of the sexual revolution and the rise of the women's movement, the 1973 tennis match between women's world championBillie Jean King(Emma Stone) and ex-men's-champ and serial hustlerBobby Riggs(Steve Carell) was billed as the BATTLE OF THE SEXES and became one of the most watched televised sports events of all time, reaching 90 million viewers around the world. As the rivalry between King and Riggs kicked into high gear, off-court each was fighting more personal and complex battles. The fiercely private King was not only championing for equality, but also struggling to come to terms with her own sexuality, as her friendship with Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough) developed. And Riggs, one of the first self-made media-age celebrities, wrestled with his gambling demons, at the expense of his family and wife Priscilla (Elisabeth Shue). Together, Billie and Bobby served up a cultural spectacle that resonated far beyond the tennis court, sparking discussions in bedrooms and boardrooms that continue to reverberate today.—Fox Searchlight Pictures In 1970, Billie Jean King and Gladys Heldman confront Jack Kramer, who has organized a tennis tournament where the top prize for women is one-eighth of the men's prize, despite equal ticket sales. King and Heldman threaten to start their own tour but Kramer won't alter the terms, citing the inferiority of women's tennis. When Billie Jean, Julie Heldman, Valerie Ziegenfuss, Judy Dalton, Kristy Pigeon, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kerry Melville Reid, Nancy Richey, and Rosie Casals sign on as the ""Original 9"" players of what becomes the Virginia Slims Circuit, Kramer bans them from tournaments organized by the US Lawn Tennis Association.. 1970. World No. 1 tennis playerBillie Jean King, long having fought for gender equality in the game, is irked to learn that the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA), which organizes professional tennis tournaments in the country, has, at their next tournament, a prize package eight times larger for the men's champion than the women's champion. King's primary beef is with former professional tennis playerJack Kramer, the face of the USLTA's stance on why men deserve more money. King and women's tennis advocate Gladys Heldman vow to fight this inequality by the USLTA by breaking with the USLTA and forming their own women's association, the threat an initially empty one in that they have no plan to back it up. They, calling the new organization the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) initially with nine players including King, are quickly able to secure stable sponsorship for a women's tennis tour with more prize money than that was offered by the USLTA. Meanwhile, fifty-five year old former professional tennis playerBobby Riggs, bored with his life working for his wealthy wife Priscilla Riggs' father and craving the excitement of the limelight and of his favorite pastimes of gambling and hustling, comes up with the idea to challenge King to an exhibition tennis match for that much desired ""equal"" prize money, he in the process portraying himself as the male chauvinist pig, the humor in the concept not lost on Priscilla, off of whose money he had long been living. This situation is set against the pressure on King, who is not only battling to stay on top especially against AustralianMargaret Court, a female tennis personality the antithesis of King, but also her personal struggles as she, faithfully married to supportiveLarry Kingin he understanding he coming second in her life to tennis, embarks on her first same-sex relationship with hairdresserMarilyn Barnett, which, if becoming public, could threaten the existence of the WTA. While realizing the outcome of her match with Riggs holds much significance, King also understands that Riggs' purpose is not to demonstrate male dominance per se as it is for Kramer.—Huggo The year is 1973.

Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) watches on TV as Billie Jean receives a phone call from one of her most famous fans, Richard Nixon.Billie Jean is at a dance with her husband Larry (Austin Stowell) when her manager Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman) walks in angrily with a letter from Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman).

Gladys tells her to take some time off but to be fully prepared when the match comes.Bobby makes amends with Priscilla over his gambling habit, but she is still none too pleased over his talk of men being superior to women and his constant comments that women belong in the kitchen.The day of the match comes. Bobby wears a gaudy ""Sugar Daddy"" jacket and presents Billie Jean with a large lollipop. Billie Jean gives Bobby a piglet. All of Billie Jean's friends are in attendance, as is Larry and Marilyn, while Bobby's family watches at home, as does Jack. The match begins. Bobby appears to lead at first, but Billie Jean comes back strong by winning more games. Bobby's hand cramps up and he is forced to take off his jacket when he gets too hot. After a prolonged game, Billie Jean emerges as the champion. Bobby shakes Billie Jean's hand, and she goes to get her trophy.Billie Jean is in the locker room crying tears of joy.

"Roman J. Israel, Esq.",2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6000478/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Roman J. Israel, Esq., a driven, idealistic defense attorney, finds himself in a tumultuous series of events that lead to a crisis and the necessity for extreme action. ROMAN J. ISRAEL, ESQ. is a dramatic thriller set in the underbelly of the overburdened Los Angeles criminal court system. Denzel Washington stars as Roman Israel, a driven, idealistic defense attorney who, through a tumultuous series of events, finds himself in a crisis that leads to extreme action. Colin Farrell costars as the monied, cutthroat lawyer who recruits Roman to his firm.—Sony Pictures Attorney Roman J. Israel is no Hollywood-movie heroic legal advocate. Slouched, he walks with a galumphing, bear-like saunter. He's instantly recognizable, not from his cinematic good looks and slick grooming, but by his ill-fitting sports coat and ancient headphones. He lives alone, frittering away the hours listening to classic jazz, eating peanut-butter sandwiches, and calling in complaints to Los Angeles' noise control offices. He's awkward before he even opens his mouth. And when he finally does, even his closest associates would like him to close it again. Quickly. Roman J. Israel is a lawyer working for $500 a week at a small law firm in Los Angeles. In his two-partner office, Israel is responsible for preparing briefs, often focusing on the civil rights of their defendants, while William Jackson, the firm's owner and a well-respected professor, focuses on the courtroom appearances that Israel struggles with. Israel has spent years developing a brief that he believes will bring social reform to the unfair use of plea-bargaining to induce guilty pleas in the justice system. Though short on interpersonal skills, Israel is gifted with a phenomenal memory as well as strong personal convictions on the meaning of justice, which he has pursued at the expense of family.. Hard-nosed lawyer Roman J. Israel has been fighting the good fight forever while others take the credit. When his partner--the firm's leader--has a heart attack, Israel assumes that role, and discovers some unsettling truths about the firm. The revelations fly in the face of his social justice values, and trigger an existential crisis that leads to extreme actions. Washington rightly earned another Oscar nomination for his charged performance. The movie opens up with Roman J. Israel Esq, (Denzel Washington) an attorney, typing up a legal brief where he's stating that he's suing himself for violating his beliefs and he should be disbarred for what he's done. We first actually see Roman working at his desk in a legal office and the phone rings. His secretary tells him that his law partner has had a heart attack, so he needs to go to court and work all the cases. She specifically tells him to just ask for continuances due to the health emergency.Roman, however, goes to court and starts lobbying for different and lower charges from prosecution and then proceeds to get into an argument with a judge over a small matter. The judge finally holds him in contempt of court that comes with a $5,000 fine. Upon returning to his law office, he's met by his law partner's daughter as well as an attorney named George Pierce (Colin Farrell) who inform him that the law firm is on a bad financial footing. They tell Roman he's going to be able to finish up some of the current cases but that the future of the office doesn't look good.From pictures in his home and from the law office it's clear that Roman was very active in the civil rights era of the 60's and his law firm was very instrumental during that time as well as afterward. Roman is invited by Maya to speak in front of a group of young protesters to give them legal advice on what to do if they're arrested and just general legal advice for protesters. While giving the speech Roman notices that some of the women are standing and the men are sitting, and he asks why that is? The women tell him that's sexist and gendered and he insists that it's polite and that chivalry should still be a part of social justice. He ends up getting into a nasty verbal altercation with the woman and walks out. Maya chases him out onto the street where they find a homeless man laying on the street. They try to see if he's breathing and the cops pull up. The cops tell Roman to get away from the body and Roman slips his business card into the man's pocket so that if the man is dead the cops have to call him and he ""doesn't end up as just some body. He's a person."" Maya is impressed and tells Roman ""who does something like that?""George Pierce ends up offering Roman a job after finding out that Roman has lots of people who want his help as he handed his card out to thousands of people over the years. It also forces George to rethink his firm a bit as it's clear they're a huge law firm with tons of money coming in. Because of Roman, he decides he wants to do more pro-bono work. One case Roman is looking into sees him interviewing a young man accused of being part of a killing. The young man tells Roman he knows who killed the man and told Roman. It turns out there's a $100,000 reward for information leading to that killing by a rich family member of the deceased. Roman puts a call into the man offering the reward from a pay phone and tells him he can tell him who did it but will require cash. They agree on the deal, even though as an attorney it's against the law for Roman to give that information out and claim a reward. They settle on a cash drop in a back alley garbage can.Roman gets the money home, and it becomes clear from his discussions with Maya and after the blowup at the protest lecture that he's ""tired of doing work for the ungrateful"" and not being compensated as much as many of his fellow lawyers. He takes his new found money to Santa Monica and eats fancy donuts on the beach, buys new shorts, and a couple of new suits. He looks content with his new outlook on things. He also decides to rent an expensive high rise apartment near the beach.Roman shows back up to work at George's law firm in his new suit and hair slicked back and George tells Roman that he's going to head up their new Pro Bono work, to which Roman replies ""This isn't gonna effect my salary is it?"" The first case they take on they go to the prison to talk to a client who is charged with murder. Coincidentally it's the killer that Roman gave up for the $100,000. The killer knows this and has the young man who told Roman about him killed as well. So Roman knows he's in trouble and the killer tells him he knows all about what Roman did and that he's going to take care of Roman as well. Roman runs back home and starts to pack and plans to get out of the area. He rents a U haul truck and packs it with what he needs, including boxes of legal briefs for a big thing that he's been working on for decades to change the justice system and make it fairer. It's something he's been telling George about as well, and Roman carries those papers with him every day in his big brief case. Roman drives out to the desert where he thinks people are trying to kill him are after him, but it turns out their just kids speeding by.Roman gets a call from Maya in the desert and realizes he has to come back and has to be someone who fights for social justice, not just some high paid attorney. So he returns to the city. He talks with George for a minute about what he wants to do and then starts to walk down the street. George sees that a man is following Roman, so George starts to follow them both. The man walks up behind Roman, and we hear a gun shot. Next, we see Roman's briefcase laying on the ground. It's assumed he's been shot and killed, although we don't actually see his body.The last scene shows George walking into a courthouse with all of Roman's legal briefs on trying to change the justice system, and the court filing person begins to file them."

However, when a young student stumbles upon Corporal John McBurney, a wounded Union deserter on the verge of death, the already frail balance of things will be disrupted, as the hesitant headmistress decides to take him in to heal from his injury. Little by little, as the unwelcome guest arouses an uneasy sexual excitation among the women of the secluded boarding school, it is not before long that they will find themselves competing for the alluring man's favour. Undoubtedly, this handsome devil is a manipulator; nevertheless, will the ladies stay forever beguiled by his charm?—Nick Riganas Martha Farnsworth runs a girls school in Virginia during the Civil War. By 1864, almost all of the students, teachers, and slaves have left; only five students and one teacher, Edwina Morrow, remain. While out in the woods searching for mushrooms, Amy, a pupil, comes across John McBurney, a corporal in the Union Army who was wounded in the leg during battle, and has since deserted. Amy brings McBurney to the school where he falls unconscious. The women lock McBurney in one of the rooms while Miss Farnsworth tends to his wounds.

Found by Amy, one of the five remaining students, he's taken in to be nursed and the only available feast of manly splendor for the eyes of six single females. Initially he's locked in for safety and 'modesty', but once properly recovering interacts, even too intimately and somewhat manipulatively, with a few of his 'secret' admirers.

American novelist Joe Castleman has been named this year's recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the award not totally a surprise but the ""telephone call"" a relief nonetheless. Joe's wife, Joan Castleman, the two who met in 1958 when she was a student in his Creative Writing class at Smith College, he married to his first wife Carol at the time, is equally as excited, she who is prepared to take on the subordinate role in supporting this Nobel journey with and for him as she has with almost everything else in his life. With their daughter Susannah nearing the end of her pregnancy, the only person that will accompany them to Stockholm is their son, David Castleman, an aspiring writer himself. Although closer to his mother, David is searching for his father's approval instead for his first major writing effort in he being ""the writer"", that approval which seems difficult for Joe to provide regardless of his true views which places a strain between son and father. Much to Joe's chagrin, who also is on the trip to Stockholm is Nathaniel Bone, who is doing research for an unauthorized biography on Joe. The pressure Nathaniel places on Joe and Joan to cooperate with him increases as Nathaniel has received a contract for the biography, the interest greater with Nobel laureate attached to his name.

After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. In early-1953 Moscow, under the Great Terror's heavy cloak of state paranoia, the ever-watchful Soviet leader,Iosif Stalin, collapses unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage. As a result, when someone discovers his body the following morning, a frenetic surge of raw panic starts spreading like a virus among the senior members of the Council of Ministers, as they scramble to maintain order, weed out the competition, and ultimately take power. But in the middle of a gut-wrenching rollercoaster of incessant plotting, tireless machinations, and frail allegiances, absolutely no one is safe; not even the feared chief of the secret police,Lavrenti Beria. In the end, who will prevail after the death of Stalin?—Nick Riganas Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power. At the forefront of the machinations is N.K.V.D. Chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria (Simon Russell Beale), after Stalin, the most feared man in the U.S.S.R. Council member Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) does his best to maintain order and thwart Beria's plans.—grantss In the Soviet Union, everyone is used to Jozef Stalin's reign of terror, with daily lists of arrests for torture, banishment, or execution. When Stalin calls a radio producer for the recording of a 1953 concert, he realizes nobody was recording it and hastily arranges for a second turn, keeping even the audience in, despite having to replace the knocked-out director and bribing the soloist, who slips in a note reviling Stalin for having her kin killed. Reading that, Stalin has a fatal cardiac arrest. It takes ours till anyone dares enter his closed office, then ministers argue how to handle his death and struggle to find competent doctors--most having been purged--and are startled: the diagnosis is coma without realistic recovery prospect. Still political alliances are forged for the next Communist reign, including roles for Stalin's arrogant daughter Svetlana and maverick military son Vasily, both overambitious. The formal deputy presides over funeral and formal power transfer preparations but especially security chief Beria and Crutchev plot to become the one purging rather then purged, while inconvenient witnesses are on the next execution lists.—KGF Vissers Farcical imagining of the 1953 goings-on in Moscow in what can be seen as the absurdity of the real life actions of the main players, those actions albeit horrific. Having led the Soviet Union in terror for thirty years with the power of his NKVD security forces to carry out that terror for the last twenty,Iosif Stalin, still relatively healthy and after listening to a live musical broadcast on Radio Moscow for which he wants the non-existent recording immediately, surprisingly drops dead, or so those around him believe as the Party has no expert to tell them so having previously killed all the doctors in Moscow. Those in the inner circle of the Party, while preparing for the State funeral according to Party policy, jockey for position, sometimes openly and sometimes behind the scenes, for their preferred place in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, the worst of those places proverbially six feet under as much of that jockeying is in direct opposition to someone else in that circle. That inner circle is comprised of:Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Moscow Committee;Vyacheslav Molotov, Foreign Secretary;Georgi Malenkov, Deputy to Stalin;Lazar Kaganovich, Minister for Labor;Anastas Mikoyan, Minister for Trade;Nikolai Bulganin, Minister for Defense; and arguably most terrifyingLavrenti Beria, Head of the NKVD. In that jockeying, the players try to curry the favor of: Stalin's two adult children,Svetlana AlliluyevaandVasili Stalin, who are also not only looking for their future place, which could easily be the way of their father without his protection, but are looking for answers as to what happened; and Field MarshalGeorgi Zhukov, Head of the Soviet Army, who has the manpower of the said army behind him.—Huggo Moscow, USSRMarch 1, 1953Based on a true story.... sort of...After a concert, famed Russian pianist Maria Yudina (Olga Kurylenko) hides a note in a recording for Soviet leader Josef Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin), saying he has ruined the country due to his ruthless and oppressive laws. As Stalin reads it in his dacha, he is paralyzed by a cerebral hemorrhage. The members of the Central Committee are alerted. The first to arrive are Interior Ministry (NKVD) head Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale), who discovers Maria's note, and Deputy General Secretary Georgy Malenkov (Jeffery Tambor). As Malenkov panics, Beria guides him to take leadership, hoping to use him as a puppet ruler under his control.The next morning, Moscow Party Head Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) arrives with the rest of the Committee, except for Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov (Michael Palin), whom Stalin added to one of his lists of enemies the night previously. Beria closes off Moscow, has the NKVD take over city security duties from the Soviet Army, and replaces Stalin's enemy lists with his own, reprieving Molotov. Khrushchev and Beria struggle for symbolic victories such as control over Stalin's mentally unstable son Vasily (Rupert Friend) and daughter Svetlana (Andrea Riseborough).When Stalin dies due to complications from his stroke a few days later, the Committee members rush back to Moscow as the NKVD loot Stalin's dacha and execute witnesses. Khrushchev goes to Molotov's home and attempts to enlist his support, but Molotov, a true believer in Stalinism, opposes any factionalism within the Communist Party. Beria buys his loyalty by releasing his wife Polina Molotova (Diana Quick) from confinement.Malenkov is named as nominal Premier while being largely controlled by Beria. At the first Committee meeting following Stalin's death, Beria sidelines Khrushchev by putting him in charge of Stalin's funeral and suggesting many of the liberal reforms which Khrushchev had planned.Stalin's body is laid in state in the Hall of Columns, while many political prisoners imprisoned by Stalin are released and restrictions on the Russian Orthodox Church are loosened, earning Beria more popular support. War hero Field Marshal Georgy Zhukov (Jason Isaacs) arrives and demands to know why the Soviet Army troops have been confined to barracks within Moscow.Beria learns that Khrushchev has a passing acquaintance with Maria, who was hired to play at the funeral, and threatens them both with the note. Khrushchev approaches Zhukov, who agrees to provide the Army's support in a coup to overthrow Beria, but only if the Committee agrees.To undermine Beria's popularity, Khrushchev orders the trains into Moscow to resume, allowing thousands of mourners into the city. As he planned, the NKVD guards around the Hall fire on the crowd, killing 1,500 people. The Committee suggests scapegoating low-level NKVD officers; as Beria believes blame attached to security services will tarnish him, he angrily threatens the Committee with incriminating documents he has collected on them. Molotov secretly tells Khrushchev and Lazar Kaganovich (Dermot Crowley) he will support the coup if they can enlist the support of the others, including Malenkov.On the day of Stalin's funeral, Khrushchev lies to the Committee and Zhukov that he has Malenkov's support. The Soviet Army overwhelms the NKVD and takes up positions outside the conference room. Zhukov and his men arrest Beria, and Khrushchev coerces Malenkov into signing the papers for Beria's trial.Khrushchev and his allies find Beria guilty of treason and of sexual assault in a kangaroo court and execute him. As Beria's body is burnt, Khrushchev gives Svetlana a ticket to Vienna and assures her that her brother will be cared for.Several years later in the late 1950s, Khrushchev, now Supreme Leader of the Soviet Union after removing his co-conspirators, as well as dissolving the NKVD and replacing the organization with the loyal KGB, attends a concert given by Maria, while future leader Leonid Brezhnev, only a row above, watches him."

Beatriz at Dinner,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5929750/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A holistic medicine practitioner attends a wealthy client's dinner party after her car breaks down. Beatriz, a holistic medicine practitioner, is stranded at a client's house and becomes a somewhat unwilling guest at a snooty dinner party that evening. A difference of thoughts and opinions causes her to be a thorn in the side of the hosts and their invited guests. A woman of a very different background with very different perceptions of the world, synchronistically has dinner with a group of wealthy people. Her strongly expressed views uncomfortably challenge their relationship with land, people, place and animals.—Sue G. Miller Beatriz, an immigrant from a poor town in Mexico, has drawn on her innate kindness to build a career as a health practitioner. Doug Strutt is a cutthroat, self-satisfied billionaire. When these two opposites meet at a dinner party, their worlds collide, and neither will ever be the same. Beatriz (Salma Hayek), a Hispanic woman in her late forties, wakes up from a dream in which she is in a rowboat in a mangrove swamp and sees a little white goat on the shore. She tends to her two dogs and a brown goat that she has penned-up in her bedroom, urging them to be quiet. She gets ready, mediates and lights candles at an altar with photos of a man and the white goat. She drives an old Volkswagon that is slow to start from her modest Los Angeles house to a cancer center where she treats patients with massage, aromatherapy and breathing exercises. She leaves in a hurry to drive to a client's home in Newport Beach, Orange County during rush hour, arriving at the grand house in the gated community a bit late.Her client Cathy (Connie Britton), the middle-aged wife of a builder, is hosting a party for some of her husband's business associates that evening. During the massage, Cathy talks about what a wonderful experience college is for her daughter, who Beatriz treated when she was recovering from chemotherapy several years before. Beatriz becomes sad and tells Cathy that she suspects her neighbor, who has made several noise complaints and asked the city to make her give up her goats, killed her white goat by breaking its neck while it was briefly in her yard.After the massage, Beatriz's car won't start. She calls a friend, who is unable to come until several hours later. Cathy impulsively invites Beatriz to join the dinner party insisting that she play guitar and sing a song after dinner. Her husband, Grant (David Warshofsky), privately protests the invitation on the grounds that they are hosting his most important business associate, but Cathy insists that Beatriz is a friend of the family and should be included.The first guests to arrive are a couple in their thirties, Alex and Shannon (Jay Duplass and Chloë Sevigny). While waiting for their hosts, they meet Beatriz and explain that Alex is a lawyer who just got a development approved by the California legislature after nearly two years of lobbying. An older couple named Doug and Jeana Strutt (John Lithgow and Amy Landecker) arrive and are met with great excitement by Cathy and Grant as well as Alex and Shannon, with Beatriz forgotten and hanging out in the periphery. Doug is a famous developer, and the couples have come together to celebrate the approval of their latest project. The men and women break off and have drinks outside. Cathy introduces Beatriz to the women and speaks highly of her empathy and skills as a healer. Beatriz tries to be open but withdraws when the women gossip mean-spiritedly about a celebrity. While Beatriz is out of earshot of the other women, Cathy briefly describes her tragic history of being separated from her immediate family as a child, having to leave her hometown, being raised by her grandmother in the U.S., and losing her husband under unclear circumstances.Beatriz's friend calls to tell her he is unable to come for her until tomorrow morning. Cathy invites her to stay the night in her daughter's old room. As everyone heads inside for dinner, Beatriz stops and listens to Doug talk about potential titles for his memoir. Doug mistakes Beatriz for a servant, asking her for another drink, and is unabashed when introduced. Beatriz thinks she knows Doug, but cannot place their association.At dinner, Beatriz talks too long and sincerely about herself for the comfort of the other guests. Doug interrupts her to ask if she came to the U.S. legally and rudely cuts her off mid-story. Doug commends her for being employed but explains that the world needs people like him who provide jobs. He talks about aggressively pushing their development forward despite pending lawsuits over an endangered bird and possible environmentalist protests, bragging that he has overcome much more opposition in the past.Beatriz explains that her hometown in Mexico was destroyed by a failed hotel and asks Doug if he was the developer, which he denies. Beatriz briefly leaves the party and makes a phone call, leaving a message to an unknown person in Spanish asking if it was Doug Strutt's company they protested against when their homes were seized for the hotel development.During dessert in the living room, Doug and his wife talk about their upcoming safari in South Africa. Doug gives an impassioned speech about having dined at the buffet of life and finding nothing as exciting and pure as hunting and killing a wild animal. He passes around his phone showing a photo of the rhinoceros he killed on his last safari. When Beatriz sees the photo, she calls it disgusting, throws the phone across the room at Doug and retreats to the kitchen. Cathy joins her and accepts her apologies and explanation that she isn't used to drinking, urging her to go to bed for the night.Alone in her room, Beatriz smokes a joint and continues to drink white wine while researching Doug Strutt on the internet. He has been involved in many controversial projects and has even evaded prison, presumably due to his vast resources to fight all charges of wrongdoing. Beatriz leaves another message in Spanish, this one heartfelt and longing, for the same unknown person as earlier. She takes the guitar she finds in the room and rejoins the party, offering a song as an apology for having been rude earlier. The song is in Spanish; she explains that it is about longing for a time when life was good but knowing that it is gone forever. She acknowledges that she and Doug don't know each other but that she had earlier thought they had been brought together by fate, perhaps so that she would have revenge by killing him. He says there are many men who do what he does and she agrees. She talks about how she has spent her life trying to heal people and how tired she has become from the endless need and her inability to do more. She tells Doug that while breaking something takes two seconds it can take a lifetime, many lifetimes to put it back together again. Cathy tries to intervene, but Beatriz tells her to shut up, declaring that the earth is dying and that they are not protected in their gated communities, that it will touch them, too.Grant removes her from the party and calls a tow truck to take her and her car home immediately. As Beatriz waits for the tow truck, she watches Doug talking on the phone in the foyer. The tow truck arrives and picks up her car, but she asks the driver to wait and goes back into the house. She takes a letter opener from Grant's desk, approaches Doug from behind and stabs him in the neck. As he dies with his head in her lap, the others come running in shouting. Cathy repeatedly asks her why she did this and Beatriz snaps out of her fantasy: she did not stabbed Doug, rather she is still watching him talk on his phone in the foyer. The letter opener drops from her hand, and she gets in the tow truck.As they drive along the ocean, Beatriz asks the tow truck driver to pull over. She makes her way down to the beach and walks into the water. As the waves close over her head, the people at the dinner party light and set loose sky lanterns. In the last scene, our view starts underwater and rises in the mangrove swamp of Beatriz's dream."

Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives. Having to wait until the doctor returns from business, Armand meets many of the people of that village who not only knew Vincent, but were apparently also models and inspirations for his art. In doing so, Armand becomes increasingly fascinated in the psyche and fate of van Gogh as numerous suspicious details fail to add up. However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincent's troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) In the summer of 1891 in France, nearly twelve months after master painter Vincent van Gogh's (Robert Gulaczyk's) mysterious death, Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), the local postman's (Chris O'Dowd's) young son, is reluctantly tasked with delivering one of the artist's final letters to his brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz), in Paris. However, when Armand discovers that Theo, too, met his own demise, he embarks on a mission to investigate Vincent's untimely death, starting off from scenic Auvers-sur-Oise.

Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely a few weeks earlier, van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris. Pere Tanguy (John Sessions), a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-Sir-Oise and look for Dr. Paul Gachet (Jerome Flynn), who housed van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), who was fond of van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan). When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father."

Although the motel's policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonee's friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobby's existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halley's friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonee's, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.—Huggo The Magic Castle, a garishly painted motel in the shadow of Walt Disney World's famous Magic Kingdom, is what Halley, a struggling single mother, and Moonee, her mischievous 6-year-old daughter, call home. But in sparky Moonee's eyes, this unappealing world, crammed with imperceptible lost souls, is a blissful utopia. However, the illusion of a carefree life always comes at a high price. And as hard-pressed Halley takes increasingly dangerous risks to eke out an existence, the consequences of her decisions become a matter of survival. At the end of the day, Halley is at a crossroads: whether she likes it or not, the young mother must either trust those around her or face danger alone. After all, we all face the consequences of our actions. And as harsh reality enters the picture, Halley will face the music. But do shadows exist in fantasy's vibrant, sun-kissed realm?—Nick Riganas In Kissimmee, Florida, a little boy named Dicky (Aiden Malik) runs to his friends, six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) and Scooty (Christopher Rivera), and brings them to a nearby seedy motel, called Future Land. The three kids run up to the second floor balcony and start spitting on a car. The car's owner, Stacy (Josie Olivo), comes out and reprimands the children, just as Moonee spits on Stacy's granddaughter Jancey (Valeria Cotto).Stacy goes next door to the Magic Castle Motel where the kids stay. She gets the manager, Bobby (Willem Dafoe), to knock on the door of Moonee's room. Her young mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) answers and is told by Bobby about the issue. The kids are then forced to go clean up Stacy's car.Halley and her daughter Moonee live at the Magic Castle for an extended stay since they are poor, as are most of the other residents in the motel, including Scooty and his teenage mother Ashley (Mela Murder), who works at a restaurant and hooks Moonee up with free food for her and her mom. Halley previously worked as a stripper but was fired after a couple of days and is struggling to come up with rent money.Another day later, Moonee and Scooty go out to play and go look for Dicky, but his father has him grounded for the spitting incident. The kids then go to Future Land and invite Jancey to hang out with them. They walk across the strip and go to an ice cream shop where they ask for change from strangers so that they can purchase and share a single ice cream cone.That evening, Moonee and Scooty witness a young tourist couple that arrives at the motel by mistake since they meant to get booked at the Magic Kingdom hotel next to the Walt Disney World parks, but instead got sent to the crummy motel.The kids spend their summer break together from school around the motel or the general neighborhood. They spy on a middle-aged woman sunbathing topless, just as Bobby comes by to tell the woman to cover up. On another occasion, the kids sneak into the maintenance room and turn off the power to the motel, causing everyone to get angry since it's a hot day. Bobby must run to the room and flip the power back on.Another day or so later, Dicky and his father leave the motel to move to New Orleans after Dicky's father has landed a new job. They give the other kids some of Dicky's old toys before saying goodbye to his friends.Moonee, Jancey, and Scooty go play by an abandoned house where they start breaking things and messing around. Scooty uses a lighter he stole and sets fire to a pillow under a chimney. This causes a big fire that spreads throughout the house. The kids run back to their homes to avoid getting in trouble. The other Magic Castle residents head over to see the house burning as firefighters try to put it out. Ashley suspects Scooty of being involved and she forbids him from hanging out with Moonee anymore.In response to Ashley's new rule, Halley brings Moonee to the restaurant where she works and makes Ashley take her order and bring them a lot of food, which Moonee quickly eats. Halley then makes Ashley pack the uneaten food to go, but Halley just tosses it on the walk back to the motel.One day, while painting outside the motel, Bobby notices an old man, named Charlie (Carl Bradfield), wandering where the kids are playing. Suspicious that the man might be a pedophile looking to abduct one or more of the kids, Bobby approaches him and asks Charlie what he's doing around there. He claims to have been looking for a soda vending machine, so Bobby takes him to one. After getting him his soda, Bobby suddenly smacks it out of Charlie's hand and aggressively sends him away, even going as far as to taking Charlie's wallet so he gets his name and home address to call in to the sheriff's office should he ever come around the motel again.Another few days later, Halley takes Moonee around town selling perfume so she can round up some money. This stops when they come across a country club and a security guard catches them. The guard tries to get Halley to go to the office to wait for the cops, but Halley tries to make off with her bag of perfume before the guard pulls it and takes some of the perfume that falls out.Another day later, Halley steals and sells four Magic Kingdom bands in the parking lot of a discount ticket stand.Halley then starts secretly working as a prostitute while keeping Moonee hidden in the bathroom, occupied by taking a bath. One of the Johns (Macon Blair) returns to confront Halley at her room over the magic bands she stole from him, while Halley feigns ignorance. Bobby comes by to settle the issue, indicating he knows what Halley's been doing, but he speaks on her defense and sends the John away. However, Bobby orders Halley to have any visitors of hers check in at the front desk. Halley throws a fit and follows Bobby into the lobby, where he threatens to kick her out if she doesn't leave the lobby. She does so but then sticks a used menstrual pad on the window.Because none of the residents of the motel are legally allowed to take up permanent residence, they exploit a loophole by staying at a nearby motel for one night a month before returning to their rooms. Bobby tries to send Halley and Moonee to another motel down the road, the Arabian Nights, which had previously agreed to a special low rate for these nights. When Halley gets there, the new owner tells her that the price has been raised by $10. Halley makes a scene again and forces Bobby to go there to talk to the managers where they inform him that they are no longer honoring the arrangement they had with the previous owners. Bobby offers to pay the difference, but the managers are so disgusted with Halley and Moonee's belligerent behavior that they refuse to allow them to stay. Halley dumps her drink out onto the floor of the office and storms out. Halley and Moonee stay the night with Stacey and Jancey at Future Land.Back at the Magic Castle, Halley goes to Ashley's room to try and make amends but also to ask her to spot her for rent money. Ashley tells her everyone in the motel knows about her prostituting herself and threatens her if she finds out Scooty was up there while Halley did that. Halley responds by attacking Ashley and hitting her until she gets a black eye. Halley returns to her room, vomits into the toilet and then cries on the floor. The next day, agents of the Department of Children and Families arrive to interview Halley and Moonee. When they leave, Halley and Moonee clean the room together and Halley gives the last of her drugs away.The next morning, after taking Moonee to a nearby hotel to eat the complimentary breakfast, Halley returns to her room to find DCF agents and two police officers at her door. They are investigating her work as a prostitute and are going to send Moonee to live with a foster family. Moonee is brought to Ashley's room to say bye to her and Scooty. Halley starts to act aggressively toward the agents and officers, just as Moonee is resisting one of the social workers trying to calm her down and take her away. Moonee runs away, leading the agents and officers to go looking for her.Moonee runs to Future Land to Jancey's room. She starts crying and is unable to say what's wrong. Jancey takes Moonee's hand and runs away with her, going all the way on foot to Walt Disney World park and running to the Magic Kingdom castle... and the movie ends here."

In the bosom of Suburbicon--a family-centred, all-white utopia of manicured lawns and friendly locals--a simmering tension is brewing, as the first African-American family moves in the idyllic community, in the hot summer of 1959. However--as the young patriarch, Gardner Lodge, and his family start catching a few disturbing glimpses of the once-welcoming neighbourhood's dark underbelly--seemingly random acts of unprecedented violence paired with a gruesome death will blemish, irreparably, Suburbicon's picture-perfect facade. Who would have thought that darkness resides even in Paradise?—Nick Riganas It is the late-1950s. Suburbicon is your typical, quiet American town. Then a African American family move into the neighbourhood and the bigoted community go out of their way to force them to leave. At roughly the same time, two strangers break into the home of their neighbours, Gardner and Rose Lodge, and tie up the family. This leads to a dramatic chain of events.—grantss Set in year 1959, the film opens with an introduction to the quaint little town of Suburbicon. Established in 1947, it has become a generally pleasant town with people from other parts of the country moving there for an idyllic lifestyle.Mailman Henry (Steve Monroe) goes around happily greeting the town's residents. He reaches the home of the new residents, the Mayers family, who happen to be African-American. When Henry speaks to Mrs. Mayers (Kamirah Westbrook), he doesn't realize she is the new neighbor until she says so. His friendly demeanor drops as he awkwardly tries to step away while ""forgetting"" to give Mrs. Mayers her mail. The other residents then react with horror to the fact that their new neighbors are black.A town meeting is held full of angry and racist white men demanding that the Mayers be removed from the town. A petition is held among all the all-white townsfolk to do something about getting the Mayers family to move out.The paraplegic Rose Lodge and her twin sister Margaret (both played by Julianne Moore) are the Mayers' next door neighbors. Rose tells her 10-year-old son Nicky (Noah Jupe) to play with the Mayers' son Andrew (Tony Espinosa). Reluctantly, Nicky goes over and invites Andrew to play catch with him.That night, Nicky's father Gardner (Matt Damon) goes into his room with another man, Louis (Alex Hassell). Gardner tells Nicky that Louis and another man, Ira Sloan (Glenn Fleshler) are about to rob them. Gardner takes Nicky downstairs where Sloan is sitting in Rose's wheelchair, and she and Margaret are being kept hostage. After they force Gardner to pour them drinks, the robbers sit the family at the dinner table and smother them with chloroform rags.Nicky wakes up in the hospital to find Gardner and Margaret, and to see that Rose is dying after being overdosed on chloroform.We cut to Rose's funeral. Rose and Margaret's brother Mitch (Gary Basaraba) comforts Nicky and gives him some extra money.People around town offer their condolences to Gardner, Margaret, and Nicky everywhere they go, while quietly insinuating the Mayers family may have been involved.Nicky starts to take precautions to avoid another incident. He sets up bars against his bedroom door to prevent anyone from breaking in. He hears what sounds like Margaret yelling in fright. Nicky grabs a knife and goes to the basement, only to find that Gardner and Margaret are engaged in kinky sexual activity, with Margaret having cut her hair and dyed it blonde to resemble Rose.Gardner is contacted by Captain Hightower (Jack Conley) and asked to come to the police station to view a lineup of suspects. Margaret arrives at the station and brings Nicky because she didn't want to leave him home alone. Nicky is left outside the room as Gardner and Margaret go in. Nicky sneaks in as Gardner is attempting to identify the men. Nicky clearly spots Louis and Sloan as the last two in the lineup. A guard mistakenly flips the light switch on, revealing the family behind the glass and making Gardner and Margaret see that Nicky made it inside.At home during a bath, Nicky asks Gardner why he didn't identify Louis and Sloan when he had the chance. Gardner dodges the question and says it's just complicated.All around town, the racist residents of Suburbicon continue to show increased hostility toward the Mayers family, particularly at the supermarket where Margaret works where the manager tells Mrs. Mayers that everything she has taken has been raised to $20.Louis and Sloan confront Gardner at work in his office. Sloan smacks him around and is angry that Nicky had seen them, and is also demanding money that was supposed to be returned after Rose was killed.Hightower visits Gardner at work to inform him that an enforcer for the mob named Frank Rizzoli had been found dead. After going through his books, it was discovered that Gardner's name was listed among those that owe money to the mob. However, Hightower also notes that they did find a hotel called Garden Lodge, and decides perhaps they were confusing it with Gardner's own name.One afternoon, Margaret is visited by a sleazy insurance salesman named Bud Cooper (Oscar Isaac). He smooth-talks Margaret before making clear his true intentions after he mentions that an insurance claim was filed by Gardner shortly after Rose's death. Margaret lets it slip that she and Gardner were in need of money after Gardner had attempted to start up his own business and subsequently failed. Margaret kicks Cooper out of the house as he continues to press her.Sloan approaches Louis at work and tells them that they need to take care of Nicky since he is going to get suspicious of the whole scheme. Sloan orders Louis to finish the job, or he will become a liability.Throughout the day, the town's residents gather outside the Mayers' home to taunt them before it gradually turns into a riot with police forced to take serious action. The mob breaks all the windows of their home and set their car on fire while planting a confederate flag. Meanwhile, Cooper visits the Lodge house. He tells Gardner he knows about their insurance fraud and that he is going to blackmail Gardner and Margaret with bringing the police over unless he receives the whole cut of the insurance claim. Margaret brings Cooper a cup of coffee, and he begins to choke after drinking it. Margaret admits to Gardner that she put lye in it. Cooper runs out in a panic as Gardner grabs a fire poker. He chases Cooper outside and swings the poker into his head, killing him. Louis and Sloan are nearby watching. Gardner stuffs Cooper into the trunk of his car and drives away to dispose of him, while Louis goes inside the house and Sloan follows Gardner.Nicky realizes what's going on and he calls Mitch for help. Margaret cuts the phone line, and Nicky locks himself in his room. Margaret makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that she laces with crushed up pills to poison Nicky, as well as his milk. Nicky refuses to touch the food. Louis sneaks up on Margaret and strangles her to death before making his way up to Nicky's room. He finds Nicky under the bed but is pulled out by someone else. After a brief struggle, the other person shoots Louis dead. It turns out to be Mitch. He gets Nicky out and brings him to hide in a closet. Mitch turns around to reveal a knife in his back from the fight with Louis. He sits down by Nicky's bed and slowly dies.Gardner takes Cooper's body out of town and leaves it in his car. He rides a bicycle home and is followed by Sloan. While distracted and yelling at Gardner, Sloan is struck head-on by a firetruck. The leaked fuel catches fire and causes the car to explode, killing Sloan. Gardner rides home.Gardner finds Nicky in the closet with a gun. He also finds the bodies of Margaret, Mitch, and Louis. Gardner sits at the kitchen table with Nicky as he starts to eat the poisoned sandwich and drink the milk. He calmly tells Nicky that he can join him in moving to Aruba with the money he will take out from the insurance claim, or Gardner will kill him.The following morning, the Mayers family cleans up the mess around their house. The unrepentant and racist neighbors continue to taunt and use them as scapegoats for the chaos that has occurred in town. Nicky is watching the news on the TV set about the race riot while Gardner lies dead at the table. Nicky goes outside and sees Andrew. He takes a ball and starts playing catch with him."
The Man Who Invented Christmas,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6225520/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The journey that led to Charles Dickens' creation of ""A Christmas Carol,"" a timeless tale that would redefine Christmas. In 1843, celebrated British novelist Charles Dickens is at a low point in his career with three flops behind him and family expenses piling up at home. Determined to recover, Dickens decides to write a Christmas story and self-publish it in less than two months. As Dickens labors writing on such short notice, his estranged father and mother come to bunk with him. Still haunted by painful memories of his father ruining his childhood by his financial irresponsibility, Dickens develops a seemingly-unsolvable writer's block. Dickens must face his personal demons epitomized through his characters, especially in his imagined conversations with Ebenezer Scrooge. With a looming deadline, Dickens struggles for inspiration against his frustrations and his characters' opinions in a literary challenge creating a classic tale that would define the essential soul of modern Christmas.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) Two years after the success of ""Oliver Twist,"" Charles Dickens is suffering financial hardship from the failure of his last three books. Rejected by his publishers, he sets out to write a new book to restore his finances. Seeing inspiration around London, most notably a rich man's funeral that is largely unattended, he begins writing ""A Christmas Carol,"" due in six weeks in order to be published by Christmas. As Charles begins to develop his story, he interacts with the characters he is writing about, most notably Ebenezer Scrooge. Helping Dickens is one of his servants, Tara, an Irish immigrant who is literate and able to provide advice. A fictional account of the creation of what has become a holiday classic. It's 1843, andCharles Dickens, who only less than a few years ago had enjoyed critical and public acclaim with Oliver Twist, is facing financial and legal troubles having had three subsequent failures in a row, with a seeming case of writer's block to boot. Gathering inspiration from things happening around him, he thinks he has the germ of an idea in seeing who looks to be a wealthy man with the attitude of a grouch, who has no reason for being such so close to Christmas. The problem is that Charles' publishers aren't too keen on a Christmas themed book, Christmas a minor holiday at best, and that to capitalize on Christmas, the book would have to be completed, including printed and distributed, within six weeks. As he continues to gather inspiration from events happening around him, Charles is guided in the physical world, much to the quiet consternation of his faithful wife Kate, by Tara, his Irish housemaid who he learned is quite well-read, and in the metaphysical world by the spirit of the story's central character, a wealthy but mean man named Scrooge, whose entrance into his psyche is complete with a Greek chorus of sorts. His writing is hindered by his parents' arrival: his father, John Dickens, with whom he has long had issue in his mismanagement of the family finances while Charles was growing up, a behavior that hasn't visibly changed. But the biggest issue in getting a completed manuscript to his satisfaction is that Scrooge seems to have a mind of his own against what Charles wants, which makes him question his ability as a writer and which only intensifies his temperamental nature.—Huggo In 1843, despite the fact that Dickens (Stevens) is a successful writer, the failure of his latest book puts his career at a crossroads, until the moment when, struggling with inspiration and confronting reality with his childhood memories, a new character is born in the depths of his troubled mind; an old, lonely, embittered man (Plummer), so vivid, so human, that a whole world grows around him, a story so inspiring that changed the meaning of Christmas forever."

One night, from the window in Peter's bedroom, she sees Glenn in Christina's room and decides to carry out the plan. The notebook and an accompanying cassette tape describe Henry's step-by-step plan to kill Glenn with a sniper rifle while covering Susan's tracks so that it will be impossible to trace the murder back to her. Susan's alibi is to be provided by executing the murder while both Christina and Peter are performing at a school talent show.Susan slips away from the talent show and puts the plan into motion. As she is about to pull the trigger, however, she realizes that Henry's plan, though ingenious, is the construct of a child, and that she must act as an adult. She immediately confronts Glenn and tells him that she is going to expose him for what he has done to Christina. Glenn replies that everyone will believe him, not her, and he tells her that he is going to call his police chief to come and bring her in. At the same time, affected by Christina's dance performance at the talent show, Principal Wilder decides to follow through on the abuse accusation and contacts the authorities. Glenn returns home, calls his relative at Social Services, and learns that an investigation is being opened into his abuse of Christina. As the police arrive at his house, Glenn kills himself.

The Hero,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5655222/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ailing movie star comes to terms with his past and mortality. Lee Hayden is a veteran actor of Westerns whose career's best years are behind him after his one really great film, ""The Hero"". Now, scraping by with voice-overs for commercials, Lee learns that he has a terminal prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Unable to bring himself to tell anyone about it, especially his estranged family, Lee can only brood alone as troubling, yet inspiring, dreams haunt him. Things change when he meets Charlotte Dylan, a stand-up comedienne who becomes a lover who inadvertently jump-starts his public profile. Now facing a profound emotional conflict of having a potential career comeback, even as his imminent death is staring him in the face, Lee must finally come to terms with both realities when he finally confesses his situation to the one person he can.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) 71-year-old veteran cowboy actor Lee Hayden records the same slogan for a Texas barbecue sauce over and over. He gets annoyed by having to do this again and again. In the car, he gets a call on his cell phone from agent Peter telling him there are no major roles for him, but Peter will keep trying.The doctor tells Lee has he has bad news. Lee researches pancreatic cancer.Then Lee visits his friend Jeremy. They both appeared in the short-lived TV series ""Cattle Drive"", where Lee's character was an older cowboy who advised a young man. They both smoke weed and Jeremy suggests other products such as cookies. Lee says he has been having a dream and that he wants to make a movie about it. Charlotte comes to buy drugs and is introduced to Lee. She seems interested in him even though she is a lot younger than he is.From time to time, the audience sees scenes from Lee's dream. It includes a man hanging from a tree.Apparently awake, Lee also spends time at the beach in some scenes, not saying anything.Lee dreams that he visits a trailer that says ""Hero"" on the door. He looks at numerous official looking documents, some of which have a lot of redactions.Lee visits his ex-wife Valarie and asks about her, and then asks about their daughter Lucy. He and Lucy have not been in touch. But he finds her playing tennis. Lee is being given a lifetime achievement award from the Western Preservation and Appreciation Guild, but she is too busy to attend. Lucy agrees to meet during the week. She is no longer a waitress but sells advertising for Google and is slightly annoyed by how little he knows about her life.Lee bumps into Charlotte when they both get lunch at the same taco truck. He asks if she would like to go to see him honored. She agrees.Lee and Charlotte drink in their limo on the way to the event. Charlotte adds something extra to her drink and asks if Lee wants the same thing. Lee agrees. As they are talking, Charlotte says the expression ""burning the candle at both ends"" comes from an Edna St. Vincent Millay poem. Lee says he doesn't understand why he is being honored because only one role that he did, in the film ""The Hero"", was really worth mentioning, and that was 40 years ago.Gary is in charge of the event and he welcomes Lee. Betsy, a fan, asks for an autograph. When the time comes to give Lee the award, Gary praises Lee's iconic role as ""The Hero"" in the film of the same name. The audience at the event watches a clip, though the movie audience doesn't get to see it and doesn't really hear it. Lee comes up to accept his award and makes a long speech where he says he is no more deserving than anyone else in the room. In fact, he picks out a random woman from the audience named Diane and presents her with the award.Out in the country, Lee is by himself dressed as a cowboy, with a white or light-colored hat, when a man in a black hat says he has caught up with him. Several other men are nearby, and they all want to capture him for some reason. Lee pulls his gun and the director yells, ""Cut."" Lee walks over to his director's style chair, which is on Lucy's tennis court, and Lucy, dressed for tennis, says hello to him and is nice to him. Then Lee wakes up in bed next to Charlotte.As they get breakfast, Lee asks if they did anything. Charlotte says they didn't do the one thing he is asking about, probably due to the molly they put in their champagne during the limo ride to the ceremony. They did, however, go out afterward to various places, and she tells Lee that he danced ""a lot"". Lee just doesn't remember. Later, they are on a rocky section of beach and Lee asks about her. She says she is a standup comedian and she invites him to watch her at a club.Lee visits Jeremy and discovers his speech from the previous night went viral. All of a sudden, Peter has numerous roles for him, one in particular which is a major space epic blockbuster. Lee is interested in that one role and has script pages faxed to him, while Jeremy marvels that Lee still does faxes. Lee and Jeremy run the lines, and Lee is actually pretty good, nailing it convincingly on the second try, and we see his skill and artistry in his craft. While the role is not typical of what Lee is used to, he is a cowboy type rescuing the daughter who thought he was dead.Lee starts to make his first appointment for cancer treatment but can't go through with it, possibly because that might interfere with the movie.Lee goes to the club where Cameron Esposito is finishing up her routine. Ali Wong then introduces Charlotte, who starts by describing what it is like to have a relationship with an old man. A really old man. She says it's exciting because he could drop dead any minute. Lee is offended and walks out. Charlotte doesn't finish the bit, and starts to move on to another topic but that is all the movie audience sees, as we watch Lee make his way out with his back to the stage.Later, Lee and Charlotte talk. Charlotte explains she had to talk about him that way because that's what the audience expects. He tells her how old he is and that Lucy is 34. Charlotte says she is older than that.At the audition for his movie role, Lee tries to say his lines from memory, but he can't, but that's okay. The director knows he will do well, and encourages him to take his time and not worry at all. It seems that he wants Lee in the role very much. Lee is given the page from the script. Lee still can't do a good job because he gets too emotional. As he is leaving a social media streamer ambushes him in the parking garage, startling Lee who says ""Not now"" but heedlessly the influencer gets pushy and in his face very closely with his imposing camera and lighting rig, so Lee pushes back and yells at him.Lee goes home and drinks. And drinks. He misses his lunch with Lucy, who is dressed nicely and in a restaurant with other people. She calls him but he is outside and doesn't answer. He tries to call her back with no success.Charlotte and Lee spend more time together and she gives him a book of Edna St. Vincent Millay poetry. She is the first person he tells he is dying. He expresses fatalistic acceptance and lack of desire to pursue treatment. Charlotte admonishes him that he should try anything and everything to fight for more time. He knows of one procedure that has a modest chance of success but Charlotte says that is at least something. She finally persuades Lee to tell his family.Lee goes to Valarie's art show, where Lee can only say it looks like what she would do, but he doesn't seem to care too much. He appears to tell Valarie the bad news.Lee meets with Lucy on a hill overlooking the ocean. They have a conversation where Lucy tells him he was hardly ever there for her. She still calls him ""Lee"" rather than ""Dad"".Charlotte finally persuades Lee to go for treatment, and he calls to make the appointment. He is sitting out on his deck overlooking the beautiful valley, and the hold music, a classical piece, is playing. The camera is looking at Lee from behind, the sky is beautiful with golden clouds and sunshine, the hills are dappled in beautiful golden light, and the music swells from off the phone to become the full resolution soundtrack and we are being carried aloft, when suddenly the music stops, and the receptionist comes back on the line. We almost forget what Lee was doing in this great moment with an almost comical conclusion with the abrupt stop in the music.When Charlotte visits for Lee's 72nd birthday, she discovers the poetry book hidden under the bed and she reads him a beautiful piece about burying loving hearts in the cold ground, and losing loved ones to death or estrangement.The movie's first scene is repeated before the end credits, but instead of BBQ chicken sauce, this time it's for ribs. Same brand. Same producer on the talk back asking for ""one more take"" as a weary Lee prepares to soldier on."
Table 19,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1412528/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Eloise, having been relieved of maid of honor duties after being unceremoniously dumped by the best man via text, decides to attend the wedding anyway, only to find herself seated with five fellow unwanted guests at the dreaded Table 19. Ex-maid of honor Eloise (Anna Kendrick) - having been relieved of her duties after being unceremoniously dumped by the best man via text - decides to hold her head up high and attend her oldest friend's wedding anyway. She finds herself seated at the 'random' table in the back of the ballroom with a disparate group of strangers, most of whom should have known to just send regrets (but not before sending something nice off the registry). As everyone's secrets are revealed, Eloise learns a thing or two from the denizens of Table 19. Friendships - and even a little romance - can happen under the most unlikely circumstances.—Fox Searchlight Pictures It is with mixed emotions that Eloise McGarry accepts the invitation to attend the wedding of Francie Millner and Douglas Grotsky, the festivities to take place at an upscale resort on an island on a lake, the island accessible only by ferry. The issue is that Francie is her oldest friend and she was to be Francie's maid of honor up until two months ago when Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, her boyfriend at the time and Doug's best man, unceremoniously dumped her via text message after dating for two years. Teddy's current girlfriend, Nikki, who he dated before Eloise, also replaced Eloise as maid of honor after Eloise already organized most of the wedding. Eloise doesn't want her and Teddy's issues to overshadow Francie and Doug's big day, they, who indirectly through Nikki, don't want her to either in moving her to Table 19 of nineteen at the reception, which Eloise knows is the table not only of the misfits, but those who were not smart enough to realize they really weren't wanted to attend the wedding. The others at Table 19 are: Jo Flanagan, Francie and Teddy's first nanny when they were kids; always bickering married couple Bina and Jerry Kepp, diner owners, acquaintances of Doug's father who owns a chain of diners, the Kepps who weren't even seated with other such acquaintances; high schooler Renzo Eckberg, whose mother encouraged him to attend instead of going to his high school prom as a better prospect to lose his virginity as no one at the reception knows him; and Mr. Millner's socially awkward nephew Walter Thimble, his uncle who never expected him to show up ""under the circumstances"". Once Eloise is able to convince those that were incredulous as to their status at the reception of being at Table 19, they all slowly begin to open up about their misfit status, which leads to some issues which none of those seated at that table thought they would be discussing with anyone at the wedding let alone total strangers they just met. Foremost, they want to help Eloise find true happiness especially in light of her situation, that happiness which may include finding a mysterious white knight in shining armor at the reception that Eloise only knows as Huck, possibly to replace Teddy in her heart and life.—Huggo Eloise McGarry attends the wedding of her oldest friend Francie Millner. It's discovered that she was originally maid of honor but ""dropped out"" two months ago after her ex boyfriend Teddy, the bride's brother and the best man, broke up with her by text after two years together. Teddy is now back with his old girlfriend Nikki, who has replaced Eloise as maid of honor. At the reception, Eloise discovers she has been seated at Table 19. While she considers leaving early, she meets a man named Huck who notices her looking distressed and offers words of advice which are not well received. Eloise decides to stay and meets her table mates: Jerry and Bina Kepp, Facebook friends with the groom's father who own a chain of diners; high-school-er Renzo Eckberg, whose parents are acquaintances of the groom and who came to the wedding in the hopes of meeting a girl; Jo Flanagan, Francie's childhood nanny; and Walter Thimble, the bride's cousin who is currently on parole..

They debate whether Table 19 is a ""good table,"" and Eloise reveals that, before getting dumped, she planned half the wedding and knows for a fact that Table 19 is for ""guests who should have known not to show up"".As the newlyweds come in the reception hall and begin dancing, Eloise starts feeling insecure and accepts a dance from Huck, whom she kisses. When he declines to sit with her, she realizes he is crashing the wedding and that ""Huck"" isn't his real name.Although the six initially have difficulty finding anything to talk about, they swiftly band together when Jo realizes Eloise is pregnant. They confront Teddy about dumping Eloise after she told him about the baby, and he reveals he dumped her because she said they would be ridiculous parents, and he was tired of disappointing her. Bitter at this development and feeling unappreciated, the Table 19 denizens move to Jo's room to smoke pot and discuss their reasons for attending the wedding. Walter reveals he went to prison for stealing $125,000 from the father of the bride, but only did so because he was conned into taking it by his former friend. Renzo tells the group the wedding is the same night as his junior prom, but his mom encouraged him to come to the wedding instead as he would ""probably have a better chance of meeting someone."" Jo believes the children she has cared for have now completely forgotten her. Going out for a walk, Jerry offers Renzo some advice about how to pick up girls, while Eloise realizes Jo has cancer. Jo admits that she is probably 'due' the same time Eloise will give birth. Eloise says she thinks she's having a girl and Jo asks that she not name her ""Jo"" as it's a tough name for a girl. Bina and Jerry fight, and she tells him the reason she came to the wedding was to have an affair with an old flame, who did not show up. They fight about their marriage, and Bina heads back inside with Walter.On Jo's recommendation, the six attempt to find the wedding crasher Eloise encountered earlier, with the aid of the wedding photographer and the hotel reception staff. They learn ""Huck"" is actually the groom from another wedding. As payback, Walter steals Huck's wedding cake to replace the one they destroyed earlier.Returning to the wedding, Table 19 is visited by the bride and groom, who express genuine happiness that everyone there has attended. Francie and Eloise talk briefly, and Francie apologizes that Eloise was seated so far away from her for the reception, and Eloise decides to leave early. Francie then assures Jo she has not forgotten her, telling a brief but touching childhood story about Teddy, inspiring the table to see him in a new light. The rest of the table tracks down Eloise and encourages her to tell him how she really feels. As the core wedding party leaves the hotel on a ferry, she shouts out an apology to him from the dock, but he's unable to hear.Eloise, Walter, Jo, and Renzo return to the wedding hall for the last of the cake. In their room, the Kepps discuss their fragile marriage and reconcile before joining the others. The mood significantly changes when Teddy suddenly appears, dripping wet from apparently jumping off the boat and swimming to shore, and asks Eloise to repeat what she yelled to him. Eloise asks that they both continue to be willing to forgive each other and they reconcile. Renzo asks the band to play them another song to which everybody dances, including Teddy.A few months later, Jo has died of cancer and the Kepps are now happy and taking care of her dog. Renzo has a new girlfriend, and Walter refers to the other Table 19 guests as his family. Eloise and Teddy are together and have a baby. They mail the birth announcements to their friends and family, including all the guests from Table 19, and the card reveals they named the baby boy Joe."
Phoenix Forgotten,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6574272/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two decades after three teenagers disappeared in the wake of mysterious lights appearing above Phoenix, Arizona, unseen footage from that night has been discovered, chronicling the final hours of their fateful expedition. Phoenix Forgotten tells the story of three teens who went into the desert shortly after the incident, hoping to document the strange events occurring in their town. They disappeared that night, and were never seen again. Now, on the twentieth anniversary of their disappearance, unseen footage has finally been discovered, chronicling the final hours of their fateful expedition. For the first time ever, the truth will be revealed. Sophie Bishop and her boyfriend Dan visit Sophie's parents in Phoenix, Arizona on the 20th anniversary of her older brother Josh's disappearance. On March 13, 1997, the family witnesses the Phoenix Lights during Sophie's 6th birthday party, with Josh recording the incident. Several strange lights appear in a ""V"" formation over the city before disappearing, followed closely by fighter jets. Josh becomes convinced they have witnessed UFO's, though others remain skeptical. Hoping to find answers to her brother's fate, Sophie begins reviewing all of Josh's saved videotapes.. The movie opens with video footage from a little girl's birthday party in Phoenix, Arizona shot by Josh Bishop (Luke Spencer Roberts). It is his little sister, Sophie's, sixth birthday and he walks around asking the party attendees to record a message to Sophie in the future. Josh's grandfather gives cringe-worthy advice that Sophie will need to learn to obey her husband at all times, causing Josh to quickly cut away. After recording his mother's message to Sophie, she turns the tables and points the camera toward Josh, asking him to say something nice to his sister. He is clearly awkward on camera, and obviously feels more comfortable being the one behind it. Josh begins to say something to Sophie when you hear the other party goers begin to exclaim in wonder at something they are seeing off camera.Josh snatches the camera up and begins recording what will be known as the Phoenix Lights, a series of mysterious lights in formation over the city. Josh zooms in as best he can and is disappointed when the lights suddenly vanish. His family begins to speculate on what the lights were, with most believing that they are something to do with the military. Josh believes that they've just seen a UFO to the disbelief of his family. They are startled when two military jets blast by over the house, blowing over the party decorations. Josh asks his father that if those were the military jets, then what were the earlier lights.The older footage stops and we hear a female voice-over, it is an adult Sophie (Florence Hartigan) saying that that night is the way she will always remember her brother. We find out that Josh and two other teens disappeared not long after the lights were seen and no trace of them were ever found. She is returning to Phoenix to film a documentary about her brother's disappearance.She is picked up at the airport by her father. We find out that Sophie and Josh's parents divorced after Josh disappeared and their mother is now selling their childhood home. Sophie, in addition to returning to film her documentary, has come to help her mother pack up the house, which includes Josh's room which has been untouched since his disappearance.Sophie asks her mother if she has any of Josh's tapes and her mother gives her a shoe box filled with all the tapes and the two begin to watch. First is a collection of newscasts from the time after the lights were witnessed and we see that Josh had some notoriety from filming the lights and we see that both he and his father were interviewed for the local news. We also see newscasts speculating on the lights origins and finally a (real life) newscast where the then-Governor of Arizona gave a press conference where he jokingly dismissed the lights possibly extraterrestrial origins by having police officers bring out their main suspect in handcuffs. It is a man in a rubber Alien mask and costume and the governor laughs off any possibility of the lights being UFOs.We see from the tapes that Josh began to film his own documentary about the lights but doesn't have much luck getting people to talk to him. It is through his efforts to make his film that he meets Ashley, another high school student interested in journalism. We first see her as Josh awkwardly interviews her about the lights and she begins to coach him in how to conduct a proper interview.Sophie, in the present, interviews Ashley's parents who describe their daughter as a bright, charming girl. You get some hint that there was tension in the family as Ashley's mother says that her father had been pushing Ashley toward a career in law, Ashley's interest clearly lay in journalism. We see footage of Ashley producing stories for her high school news. When Sophie asks her mother about Ashley and Josh, she states that she was pretty sure Josh had a crush on Ashley and she hopes that Ashley returned his feelings so that he would've been able to experience love in his life.Working with Ashley, Josh interviews two astronomers who show the two teens some meteors they had found and tell them that the lights were most likely military flares. They do not share Josh's opinion on the lights being a UFO, which annoys him when Ashley seems to be leaning toward the two men's belief. Josh and Ashley also interview a local Native American who is knowledgeable on the local legends of his tribe. They are taken aback when the man tells them that he did not see the lights personally the night Josh filmed them, but he has seen something similar before when he was younger.Josh and Ashley also visit a library to research historical sightings of UFOs, which include a biblical description of God's Chariot as a series of fiery rings descending from the sky and Native American petroglyphs depicting rings and strange beings. Josh thinks the picture of the spinning rings looks like the ship from the movie Contact, and he is pleased when Ashley says that Contact is one of her favorite movies. As they descend in the elevator on the way out of the library, Ashley does a spot on impersonation of Jody Foster in that movie, recreating the scene while Josh laughs.They determine that they need to visit the area where the Native man they interviewed said he'd seen the lights previously, but neither of them has a car and they are stuck. Josh asks his friend Mark, (Justin Matthews) to drive them as he has a vehicle.Mark comes to Josh's house the night before they leave and as they prepare for the trip, they see on the news that the lights have reappeared. Josh recognizes the area where the lights have just been seen and the two set out to the area from the newscast.They arrive and Josh excitedly scans the skies while Mark reminds him that they are leaving in just six hours. Josh notices a bright light shining up into the sky and he and Mark climb up to where it is. They are surprised to see a gathering of police officers gathered around a bright spotlight. Mark immediately says they should leave as Josh films them. Josh notices that the officers vehicles do not have license plates and that they have a telescope they are using to search the sky. Josh says that they are obviously looking for the lights, the two are spotted and they quickly run down the hill and back to their car.The next morning they pick up Ashley and set off south of Phoenix. The tape ends as they light-heartily set off out of Phoenix.In the present day, Sophie interviews several of the police officers and rescue officials who looked for her brother and his friends. Most admit to being truly baffled as none of the evidence makes much sense. Mark's vehicle was found, pulled off of the road and seemingly in working condition. The manner in which it was left seems to indicate no foul play. Traces of blood were found in the vehicle, later identified to be Mark's but not enough to be life threatening. Sophie asks one officer to speculate on what he thinks happened to them. And he says it could've been anything, a falling out between Mark and Josh over Ashley, the kids stumbling across drug smugglers, etc. He says that all they found were dead ends and eventually they had to give up the search. We see a newscast with an interview with Sophie and Josh's father where he expresses anger that the police are giving up the search. One last bit of evidence is discussed as Josh's camera, with one last tape in it, was also found left in the vehicle.Sophie is able to obtain this tape and watches it. It details the drive south by the teens, as Josh sleeps, Ashley asks Mark how he knows Josh. Mark says that kids in their church group made fun of Josh for his red hair by calling him Ginger. Mark, not realizing that they were insulting him, thought it was just a cool nickname and was impressed everyone seemed to know who Josh was and determined he would be a person to get to know. As they travel it is clear that Mark and Ashley are hitting it off, much to Josh's annoyance. The tape ends as they reach their intended search area where they find the bodies of coyotes that appear to have been burnt to death by something. The tape ends as Josh mutters angrily at the limitations of his camera when he tries to focus on the dead coyotes.Sophie wonders at the unlikelihood that Josh would leave his camera behind and not film the rest of their trip, speculates that they may have had another camera. Since Ashley was part of her schools journalism class she wonders if Ashley might have signed out another camera to take with them. Sophie goes to Ashley's school and interviews the current head of the AV department asking if there would be any record of Ashley signing out a camera. The teacher tells her that with it being twenty years ago there would be no records of that and she herself was not teaching at that time and wouldn't know.Later, Sophie is watching an interview with the former governor who is now admitting that he lied about there being a rational explanation for the lights and he held the joke press conference to keep people from panicking. He now admits that he thinks that the lights really were a UFO. Sophie tracks down the governor's former press secretary and catches him outside his house. She confronts him over his refusal to talk with her and wants to know why they lied, or if someone made them lie. The man refuses to speak with her and shuts the door in her face. Sophie expresses her frustration that, once again, there are nothing but dead ends and prepares to leave Phoenix. She helps her mother pack up the house and is once again driven to the airport by her father.Sometime later, Sophie returns to Phoenix as she has received a call from the AV Teacher saying she has found something. It turns out that the teacher was organizing the schools equipment storage room and had come across a box that had been mailed to the school sometime after the disappearances. The camera appears to have been exposed to great heat as it looks partially melted. Sophie asks if she can keep the camera and the teacher lets her take it.Sophie and her camera man are examining the camera and find that there is another tape contained within. They remove the new tape and prepare to watch it. Sophie hits play.We then cut to her sitting stunned outside her house clearly blown away by what she has just seen. After watching the footage, she has contacted an Air Force official and sent him a copy of the video. She has arranged an interview with the officer, but when she arrives at the base, he asks to speak with her. Her cameraman films her from their car while Sophie goes to speak with the officer. He tells her that he cannot grant her the interview he promised. When she asks why, he leans in to talk to her, but a plane passing overhead drowns out what he says to her. When she gets back in the car, her cameraman asks what the officer said. She says that he told her to never let the footage get out. As they drive away, the cameraman asks Sophie what she is going to do, she replies, ""What do you think Josh would do?""We then see the new tape. As Josh, Ashley and Mark set off into the rocky desert. As they walk through rock canyons they find petroglyphs depicting the rings. They finally reach the top of a ridge and they sit to rest and Mark reveals that they have a few beers that Ashley was able to get someone to buy for them at a gas station. As they sit, Ashley suggests they play truth or dare. Mark chooses dare, but she dares him to tell the truth. Josh, clearly annoyed at the flirtation between Ashley and Mark, asks Mark what is going on with Mark and another girl at school. Ashley is clearly dismayed and angry that Mark apparently has a girlfriend and asks why he didn't bring her with them. Mark explains he didn't want to make it awkward by turning the trip into a double date. But as the moment gets tenser, Mark sees a light off in the distance. They film a craft as it clearly flies in the distance. Josh and the others are ecstatic at their success in capturing it on video.Josh makes them wait to see if the light returns, but eventually they convince him that they need to get back to the vehicle as Mark needs to get back home and Ashley need to get back before her curfew. She has not told her parents where she has gone.They set off in the dark, but it becomes clear that Mark cannot find their way back as he had promised. They walk further and further the wrong way, coming across more petroglyphs of strange hand prints. Eventually Ashley gets Mark to admit that he doesn't know where they are and demands to see their compass. Mark takes off up a hill to try and spot the car from above and Ashley calls Josh over to see that the compass is spinning randomly around and is useless in finding their way.They begin to hear a strange sound and the picture on the camera begins to glitch. Soon they are blinded by a bright light directly above them and a deafening sound. The light disappears and Josh and Ashley are freaked out. Mark returns, clearly shaken asking if they saw it. When he realizes they hadn't seen anything, he will only say that he saw the car and rushes off towards it despite Josh asking him what he saw.They find the car and quickly load in and take off back towards home. Josh continues to ask Mark what he saw, but Ashley becomes concerned as Mark chugs water and is clearly unwell. Mark insists he is OK but then they are distracted by a light appearing behind them. The teens argue over whether or not it is a car as the light gets closer and closer, finally overtaking them with a bright flash. The car dies, all the electronics failing. Josh and Mark push it to the side of the road, where it will eventually be found by the police.They decide to walk down the highway towards the gas station to get help. Josh and Ashley become more and more concerned as Mark is clearly ill, his nose has started bleeding heavily, accounting for the traces of his blood found in the car. Mark still insists he is fine and they begin to walk down the dark highway.Mark lags further and further behind, and then suddenly insists he can hear something in the desert. He takes off of the road into the desert and as Josh and Ashley chase after him he shouts that he can hear is brother. Suddenly the camera glitches and the sky lights up and rocks and other debris begin to fly up off of the ground around Ashley and Josh who take shelter. There is one last flash and the rocks begin to fall back, pelting them both. Mark has disappeared and the two search frantically for him.Josh finally convinces Ashley that they need to continue on to get help and they will come back to find Mark. As they climb a hill they see a light off in the distance and Josh realizes that it is a house where they can presumably find help. As they wearily head towards the house, Josh see that Ashley's nose has started to bleed like Mark's had. They continue towards the house, Ashley tiredly runs her hands through her hair and is horrified when she comes away with strands of her hair. She panics as she realizes she is losing her hair and Josh tries to comfort her.Soon, Ashley is showing the same delirium as Mark had, finally running ahead of Josh claiming she can hear her father. The light returns and Josh tries to stop Ashley from running towards it as the camera glitches and lightning strikes around them. Things again begin to get sucked up into the air as the camera just makes out the sight of rings rotating above them. Then, in another flash of light, Ashley vanishes leaving Josh alone.He runs away and finally reaches the house, which appears to be deserted as he frantically searches through it for help. He hides in the bathroom and panics when he sees his reflection and notices that his nose has started to bleed. Light begins to shine in through the windows and the houses electrical outlets short out and burst into flame. Loose items and the water in the sink begin to fly up as the force of the ship begin to work on the house. Finally the roof is ripped away and the camera falls to the ground as it records Josh being sucked up into the ship.The camera has been sucked up as well, but the view spins crazily as the camera falls hundreds of feet towards the ground before hitting, where it will presumably be found and mailed back to the school.We then see some text that states that the Phoenix Lights have never been explained and that Josh, Ashley and Mark were never found."
Disobedience,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6108178/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman returns to her Orthodox Jewish community that shunned her for her attraction to a female childhood friend. Once back, their passions reignite as they explore the boundaries of faith and sexuality. From a screenplay by Sebastián Lelio and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the film follows a woman as she returns to her Orthodox Jewish community that shunned her decades earlier for an attraction to a female childhood friend. Once back, their passions reignite as they explore the boundaries of faith and sexuality. Based on Naomi Alderman's book, the film stars Rachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola.—Bleecker Street In a Jewish Orthodox Synagogue in Hendon, the frail Rav Krushka (Anton Lesser)
collapses whilst giving a sermon. As funeral rites commence in London, the Rabbi's exiled
daughter Ronit Khruska (Rachel Weisz) is living her life as a photographer in
Manhattan. During a photo shoot she is told by the Brooklyn Synagogue of her father's
death; wounded by the news and in a vulnerable state, she gets drunk in a local bar and
sleeps with an undetermined man.Ronit flies home to London where she feels out of place in the Orthodox Jewish community
she left behind. She is greeted at the home of Dovid Kuperman (Alessandro Nivola), a
son figure to the Rav, who is taken aback by the unexpected return of his childhood friend.
Her welcome inside the home is hostile from those in the community gathering in the Rav's
honour. Her aunt Fruma Hartog (Bernice Stegers) greets her more openly, though the
air is frosty between Ronit and her uncle Moshe Hartog (Allan Corduner). Ronit is both
upset and angry that she was not informed of her father's illness and that her father's
obituary claims he was childless.Despite tension surrounding Ronit's sudden departure in the past, Dovid invites her to stay
with him and his wife. Ronit is shocked to discover that he is married to their former best
friend Esti (Rachel McAdams), now a teacher at an Orthodox girls' school. It is
uncomfortable between the two women; a complicated past is clearly hanging over them.
The next day Ronit visits her father's grave. After further prayers at their home, Dovid, Esti
and Ronit go to a dinner at the Hartog house with Rabbi Goldfarb (Nicholas Woodeson)
and Rebbetzin Goldfarb (Liza Sadovy). Ronit tries to talk to her Uncle about selling her
father's house, but he tells her now is not the right time for such a topic. Conversation turns
to Ronit's successful career as a photographer and Rebbetzin questions why she goes by
Ronnie Curtis after seeing one of her photos in a magazine. Esti, quietly joining in the
conversation, states that women change their names all the time when they get married and
lose their own history. Everyone is silently shocked at Esti's controversial comment.Rebbetzin continues questioning Ronit's life in New York and asks why she is still not
married, as it's the way it should be for a woman. Ronit disagrees, calling marriage an
institutional obligation and if she had stayed in the community and been married off, she
would have killed herself. Everyone is shocked by her outburst and Ronit, blaming her jet
lag, excuses herself to go home. Dovid, upon Esti's request, leaves to walk her home. Ronit
breaks down to Dovid, hoping her father knew she truly loved him. Dovid, struggling against
the rules of his religion, tries to comfort his childhood friend without touching her.Ronit visits her uncle Hartog at his wigmaker's shop to continue the discussion of selling her
father's house, but is informed by Hartog that the Rav left the house and all its contents to
the Synagogue. She leaves and soon runs into Esti outside a supermarket. They visit the
Rav's house together - a rundown mess full of medical equipment, it is not so much the
house that Ronit wanted, but for her father to acknowledge her in his will. Esti admits that
she does not want Ronit to leave again; past feelings are reignited and they kiss, at first
timidly as Ronit pulls back, and then passionately. Ronit retreats once more, confused about
her feelings.They leave the house and Esti confesses that she had called the Brooklyn Synagogue to let
Ronit know of her father's death. She tells Ronit that she married Dovid, a man she doesn't
love romantically but respects, as she was mentally unwell following Ronit's sudden
departure and married their best friend upon the Rav's suggestion. As they relax into each
other's company and kiss again, they are interrupted by Hinda (Clara Francis) and husband
Lev (Mark Stobbart) and are unsure how much they saw. Esti rushes home, tense; she
almost embraces Dovid but their marriage still lacks the passion she has with Ronit.
At school, Esti is summoned to see the headmistress Mrs. Shapiro (Caroline Gruber)
where Hinda and Lev are waiting to confront her. Allegations about Esti and Ronit also
plague Dovid when he is asked by the Synagogue to take on the Rav's work.Ronit waits for Esti at the school gates, where Esti tells her about the formal complaint Hinda
and Lev have submitted against her. Upon Ronit's suggestion, they escape the close knit
community and head into central London for the day. Ronit and Esti continue to be conflicted
in their attraction to one other; Esti feels guilty and is trying to lead a good life in line with her
faith, but cannot help but desire her former lover. They go to a hotel where they make love,
completely at ease and euphoric in each other's company. They talk about how Ronit's
father first learnt of their relationship all those years ago.Esti returns home late at night, where Dovid is waiting in their bedroom. He tries to get close
to her but his yearning to be intimate with his wife is rebuked once again by a confused Esti.
Nauseous the next day, Esti begins to wonder if she is pregnant. Dovid confronts Esti about
Mrs Shapiro's accusations and she admits what happened between them. Dovid's anger
almost turns violent as he releases his frustration at his wife's inability to embrace their life
together. Ronit, having overheard the argument, tries to persuade Esti to leave her husband,
but Esti struggles to come to a decision. They both try to convince each other, and
themselves, they are happy in their lives.Unable to cope with the current events, Dovid seeks refuge in a quiet Synagogue library.
The atmosphere is tense when he returns home for dinner with Ronit and Esti. When Ronit
announces that she has booked a flight back to New York that night, Dovid seems relieved
and quietly asked his wife what she plans on doing now. Ronit and Esti share a difficult
goodbye, both unable to share their true feelings. Esti accuses Ronit of taking the easy
option by leaving, Ronit storms out the house and Esti slams the door behind her; both
heartbroken at the recent events.In the middle of the night, Esti leaves the house whilst Dovid is asleep and returns to the
hotel room with a pregnancy test. Waking up at the airport the next morning, Ronit receives
a panicked phone call from Dovid saying Esti is missing. After trying to calm him down, she
continues to check into her flight, but later decides to leave and help Dovid in the search for
her.Returning home after failing in their search for Esti, Ronit is still angry that Dovid didn't tell
her of her father's illness. Esti returns from hiding and, having heard everything, announces
her pregnancy. Dovid is joyous, believing a child will solve all their marital problems, but Esti
instead asks for freedom for her and her child. She was born into the community and wants
to give her child the freedom of choice she never had. Dovid is speechless and Esti feels
guilty for crushing her husband's dreams of becoming a father.Ronit and Esti attend the Hesped at the Synagogue, intimidated by the judgemental looks
they receive. Esti tries to make peace with Dovid, but he ignores her. Moved by the temple's
sacred atmosphere, Ronit asks Esti to be with her in New York. They clutch hands as Dovid
takes to the podium, where he struggles to deliver the official speech on the Rav's passing.
Seeing Ronit in the crowd, he instead contemplates the notion of freedom and choice, a
topic that the Rav spoke about in his final sermon, and grants Esti the autonomy she has
requested. Dovid declines the Synagogue position and abruptly leaves the Hesped. Outside,
overcome with emotion Esti and Dovid hug. Ronit watches on in the distance until Dovid
extends an arm and the three friends have a long heartfelt hug together.The next morning, Ronit prepares to leave for the airport. She bids a quiet farewell to Dovid
outside his bedroom and goes to see Esti, who has slept on the sofa. They say goodbye; it
seems Esti has decided against joining Ronit in New York. As Ronit's taxi pulls away down
the street, Esti runs after her and the pair share a long goodbye kiss, promising to remain in
contact. An emotional Ronit visits her father's grave one last time and takes a photo,
achieving a sense of closure over his passing and the recent events."

First Reformed,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6053438/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A minister of a small congregation in upstate New York grapples with mounting despair brought on by tragedy, worldly concerns and a tormented past. The pastor (Ethan Hawke) of a small church in New York with dwindling attendance gets a call from a pregnant parishioner (Amanda Seyfried) begging for help with her extremely radical husband. After getting involved, the pastor loses control of every aspect of his life. A lonely and depressed pastor of a small historical church, Ernst, suffers from extreme PTSD and guilt after a parishioner's spouse takes his own life. This suicide is a trigger point for Ernst as it brings back painful and regretful memories of his own son. He soon spirals out of control. Reverend Ernst Toller of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York is writing down his thoughts in a journal for a year, after which he intends to destroy it. First Reformed, a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church, faces dwindling attendance under Toller's leadership, which has taken the church in a new direction and away from its historical focus on Reformed theology. In trying to manage his own life issues, Toller seeks a deeper experience through reading Roman Catholic (Thomas Merton and G.K. Chesterton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This new spiritual direction leads him to seek support from a nearby charismatic megachurch, Abundant Life, which owns the historical landmark, and previous stop on the Underground Railroad. Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is a solitary, middle-aged parish pastor at a small Dutch Reform church in upstate New York on the cusp of celebrating its 250th anniversary. Once a stop on the Underground Railroad, the church is now a tourist attraction catering to a dwindling congregation, eclipsed by its nearby parent church, Abundant Life, with its state-of-the-art facilities and 5,000-strong flock. When a pregnant parishioner (Amanda Seyfried) asks Reverend Toller to counsel her husband, a radical environmentalist, the clergyman finds himself plunged into his own tormented past, and equally despairing future, until he finds redemption in an act of grandiose violence. Ernst Toller is the pastor of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York, who is struggling with a crisis of faith. The film opens with him writing down his thoughts in a journal, which he plans to keep for a year, and then destroy. He leads a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. It faces dwindling attendance under Toller's leadership, which has taken the church away from its historical focus on Calvinist theology; it now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller, a former military chaplain, is also struggling with the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the Iraq War, and with alcoholism. Toller seeks a deeper spiritual understanding through reading Roman Catholic writers (G. K. Chesterton and Thomas Merton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life, the evangelical megachurch in Albany that owns First Reformed.He is approached by Mary, who is seeking counseling for Michael, her radical-environmentalist husband. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs: he explains that he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by climate change. Mary finds a suicide vest belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it, promising to counsel Michael about it. Mary and Toller discuss going to the police, but Toller feels it would worsen Michael's state. Just before their next appointment, Michael sends Toller a text message asking to meet in a local park. Toller arrives to find Michael dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael's will and testament, a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump, where his ashes are scattered.Meanwhile, plans are underway to celebrate the 250th anniversary of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor, the governor, and Edward Balq, one of Abundant Life's key financial backers and the owner of a polluting factory. At a meeting in a diner, Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael's will and deems it a political act, and the two argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as ""complicated"", but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian stewardship.Experiencing physical pain, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor, who suspects stomach cancer and schedules some tests. Toller has Michael's laptop computer, which he took after Michael's suicide to prevent the police from discovering Michael's radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael's concerns, including the materials on Balq's factory which inspired him to make the explosive vest. One night, Mary visits Toller in the parsonage of the church, and he plays Michael's role in a nonsexual rite of physical intimacy that the couple used to perform.Toller begs Mary not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony, he puts on the explosive vest, and arms it. When he sees Mary entering for the ceremony, he removes the vest and instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his alb. Toller pours a glass full of drain cleaner and is about to drink it when Mary interrupts him. The two embrace, kissing passionately before the film abruptly cuts to black. (from Wikipedia)"

She gently pets him and then reaches into her bag and pulls out a knife.Amanda is brought to the home of her childhood friend Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) so that she can tutor Amanda. Amanda tells Lily she can't seem to feel genuine emotions, and her behavior is frequently off-putting to Lily, which is why they haven't been friends in so long. Amanda also finds out that her mom paid Lily to hang out with her instead of just tutoring her, although Lily tries to deny it.Amanda meets Lily's stepfather Mark (Paul Sparks), who is rude to Lily and annoys her by constantly using a rowing machine. Noticing that Lily hates Mark, Amanda prods her with questions until she eventually suggests that she should kill him. Lily thinks it's a dumb plan.Some time later, Lily attends a party where her peers are talking about how Amanda mutilated her horse and that there are pictures of the crime scene floating around the internet. Outside, an argument is taking place between the party's host and an older guy named Tim (Anton Yelchin), who is trying to hit on the guy's sister. Another guy notes that Tim did jail time for statutory rape. The first guy hits Tim in the face and makes him leave. As Lily is leaving the party, she runs into Tim, who tries to engage her in conversation, but she is not interested.Lily finds out from her mom (Francie Smith) that she got expelled from her private school for plagiarizing a paper, and now she is being sent to a different school, which Mark has already paid for. Lily responds by going to sabotage Mark's rowing machine, which later results in him having a broken nose and wrist. When Lily's mom tries to help him, Mark acts like a dick to her. This brings Lily to meet with Amanda again to decide that she definitely does want to kill Mark. However, Amanda notes that it wouldn't be easy since she is already awaiting trial for animal cruelty, so if she were anywhere near the crime scene, she would be screwed. Amanda reveals that she killed Honeymooner because he was in pain and couldn't walk anymore. She tells Lily they need to establish alibis and be away from the area.The girls find Tim working at a retirement home and they hire him to carry out the hit on Mark. He goes with them to Lily's house where they plan to set things up for the murder, and that it needs to be the upcoming Saturday since Lily is going to a spa with her mom and Amanda takes psychotherapy sessions. When Tim sounds hesitant, Amanda plays an audio recording of Tim selling hard drugs to a minor. Tim pulls out a gun and taunts the girls by pointing it at them until Amanda knocks him over the head with a lamp, resulting in a head injury. The girls blackmail Tim into going through with the plan or they will send the audio to the police.Come Saturday, Mark is home alone. He notices the light from outside go on as Tim is creeping through the back, but he only goes to get his gun that the girls hid in a grill, and he leaves Mark alone.The girls realize Tim failed to carry out the hit, but they know he can't report them due to his own criminal record. Lily and Mark later argue over him sending her to a boarding school while Amanda hides while holding a knife. Mark chastises Lily for smoking in the house, to which Lily responds that he should leave her mother if he really cares about her. Mark tells her he is going to cut off her funding after the school year is up.At night, the girls are watching a movie when Lily admits to Amanda that she spiked her screwdriver with Rohypnol so that she can kill Mark herself and frame Amanda for it. Lily tries to back out, but Amanda chugs the drink and tells her to go through with the plan because she feels her own life is going nowhere. After Amanda passes out, Lily goes upstairs. We hear thumping sounds, and Lily runs back downstairs covered in Mark's blood. She rubs some of it on Amanda and lays next to her.A while later, Lily arrives at a restaurant for a college interview. She finds Tim working there as a valet. He heard about Mark's murder, but Lily is clearly doing fine. Tim asks about Amanda, who was sent to a mental institution after being framed. Lily tells Tim that Amanda sent her a letter. We hear Amanda's voice as we see her in the institution, with her describing a dream to Lily about Amanda being a horse, and another where she is Honeymooner and her spirit rises to see time speed up where new people are moving into the neighborhood and making things better. When Tim asks Lily what the letter said, she says she just threw it out.'Dedicated to Anton Yelchin.'"

Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6595896/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town is 10 years old today. This means he is now old enough to become a Pokémon Trainer. Ash dreams big about the adventures he will experience after receiving his first Pokémon from Professor Oak. Ash Ketchum, a kid from Pallet Town, embarks on a journey across the Kanto region to become a Pokemon Master. With his partner Pikachu, who at first hated Ash. But the bond of Pikachu and Ash builds as they travel to beat gyms and enter the league of Kanto.—William A 10 year old trainer named Ash Ketchum dreams of being a Pokémon master. But when he wakes up late and gets a Pikachu from Professor Oak, Ash must try to forge his bond with his new friend and discover the secrets of the world they're living in.—RetroPokeFan Note: this is the original Japanese language animate film with English subtitles.The movie begins in a stadium where a Pokémon battle is proceeding between two trainers (in one of many Easter eggs, the two trainers previous appeared in Mewtwo Strikes Back, the very first Pokémon movie). Watching it on TV is Ash, a boy from Pallet Town in the Kanto region, who will be setting off on his Pokémon journey the next day and choosing his first Pokémon from the standard selection of Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. However, he is so excited that during the night, he dreams he is a trainer and accidentally throws his Poké Ball-shaped alarm clock, breaking it. The next morning, Ash's mom Delia wakes her son telling him he overslept. Panicking, he runs to the laboratory of the town's Pokémon expert Professor Oak who realizes Ash is the fourth (and last) beginning trainer he's expecting that day. Unfortunately, the three starter Pokémon have already been claimed by trainers who were on time. A desperate Ash is willing to take any Pokémon available at this point, and Professor Oak tells him there is one more Pokémon available; a troublesome yellow Pokémon known as Pikachu. Ash declares Pikachu to be the best of all and accepts, happy he's getting a Pokémon at all. Unfortunately, Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon and enjoys electrocuting Ash (whom it doesn't like very. Professor Oak gives Ash Pikachu's Poké ball; however, Pikachu steadfastly refuses to get inside as it doesn't like being confined.Ash sets off on his journey dragging an uncooperative Pikachu behind him on a leash but eventually takes it off as a sign of good will. Ash sees a Pidgey nearby and tries to capture it by throwing a Poké Ball, but it gets out. Remembering Pokémon have to be weakened before they can be captured, Ash tries to send Pikachu to take it on, but Pikachu refuses. Ash is then forced to try throwing rocks, but accidentally misses Pidgey and hits a Spearow instead. Spearow is very angry but takes its anger out on Pikachu who fights back with its electricity and sends it into a tree where it reemerges with its entire flock, dozens of Spearow which chase Ash and Pikachu whom they manage to severely injure when they catch up and start attacking it en masse. Ash picks up Pikachu and tries to lose the Spearow by jumping into a fast-moving river (nearly getting eaten by a Gyarados for its troubles) but still can't shake it. As he's running, a heavy rainstorm begins, and Ash ends up slipping in the mud. Ash promises Pikachu he'll protect it and asks that it get inside its Poké Ball where it'll be safe. Deciding to stop running away, Ash then stands up to the Spearow flocking vowing that one day he'll be a Pokémon Master and will catch all of them. The Spearow fly at Ash, but Pikachu jumps off Ash's shoulder and lets out a massive Thunderbolt which sends the Spearow flying away. As they recover, the sun emerges and a rainbow forms. Ash and Pikachu then see a magnificent flying Pokémon flying by into the rainbow, during which is drops a feather which is picked up by Ash who vows to Pikachu that one day they'll get to meet the Pokémon they just encountered. Pikachu agrees, and a friendship is born.As the theme song plays (a remix of the original series song), Ash and Pikachu begin their journey together. They win battles, strengthen their bond and manage to make their first capture, a Caterpie. Ash also begins challenging the Pokémon Gyms and defeats Erika, the Celadon City Gym Leader, for the Rainbow Badge (his third). At this point, Ash decides to go to the local Pokémon Center and call his mom and let her know how he's doing. Delia is furious as she hasn't heard from him for a while despite leaving messages all over asking him to phone. Ash apologizes but then overhears that an Entei (one of the Legendary Pokémon) has been spotted close by. Ash quickly hangs up and goes chasing it, as does everyone else in the place (which includes Jessie, James, and Meowth of the villainous Team Rocket).Ash quickly finds Entei nearby and sends Pikachu to battle it, and as he does a girl named Verity appears and sends her Pokémon, Piplup out to battle it too. However, neither Pokémon makes much on an impact on Entei, who seems to take a special interest in Ash. At the same time, another boy called Sorrel arrives and tries to battle Entei with Lucario, but it eventually beats them all and runs off. Ash and Verity blame each other for what happened and decide to battle each other however Sorrel warns them a rainstorm is coming. The two don't believe him and battle anyway with Pikachu and Piplup, however, during the battle, they accidentally strike an Onix which is furious and attacks. Ash, Verity, Pikachu, and Piplup try to run away from the gigantic rock snake, but accidentally end up on its back. As it tries to shake them off, Ash jumps off and in front of Onix, blocking the way. Onix is ready to crush Ash, however, Piplup protects Ash with a Whirlpool attack, allowing Ash to apologize. Onix accepts this and burrows away. Ash and Verity apologize to each other, just as the predicted rain starts. Meanwhile, Team Rocket decide to try and capture Entei but get blasted off into the sky for their trouble.The two look for shelter when they see a Charmander on a rock. The two approach it as it seems to be waiting for someone. Suddenly a boy named Cross appears with his Dusk Form Lycanroc, and Charmander happily runs towards him. Cross, however, kicks Charmander away, disgusted that Charmander would have waited this long for him to return. Ash and Verity are disgusted, but Cross doesn't care tells them that strength is all that matters when it comes to Pokémon before leaving. The rain is now falling heavily, and Charmander's tail flame is nearly out leaving it close to death. The two run with Charmander to the nearest shelter, a large cave where Sorrel is also residing. Upon seeing Charmander's condition, Sorrel, who wants to be a Pokémon Professor so has some knowledge of Pokémon medical training, treats it and leaves it to recover overnight next to a fire. The three then introduce themselves to each other, with Sorrel explaining that he wants to learn about Legendary Pokémon to help with his dream when Entei walks in with other Pokémon looking to escape the bad weather. They decide not to disturb it and at the same time Marshadow, a Mythical Pokémon, takes interest in Ash and hides in his shadow. Verity and Sorrel recall Piplup and Lucario into their Poké Balls to protect them from the cold, but Pikachu again refuses to get into his. Piplup and Lucario then emerge from theirs, and their trainers decide to let them stay outside. The next morning, Charmander has completely recovered, and Ash asks it if it would like to go with him. Charmander agrees, and Ash captures it. Ash, Verity, and Sorrel (who are both from the Sinnoh region) decide to travel together for a while.The three have many adventures, and one day Ash sends Caterpie out to battle a Pinsir causing it to evolve into Metapod. Pinsir gets away, but Ash is happy enough that Metapod evolved. That evening, Verity looks through pictures on her phone (which reveal that her mother is none other than Sinnoh League Champion Cynthia) when she hears a noise and spots Suicune looking at her. Verity tells the others what she saw, and also admits she traveled from Sinnoh to Kanto to get away from her overbearing mother. Later at the Pokémon Center Sorrel looks up the legend of Ho-oh and how it revived three Pokémon who died in a fire to become Entei, Raikou, and Suicune. Ash recognizes Ho-oh as the Pokémon he saw after the incident with the Spearow and shows Verity and Sorrel the Rainbow Wing which shoots a beam of light into the distance. Sorrel looks up information and finds that Ho-oh is looking for a RainBow Hero to fight for it, and warns that Rainbow Wings lose their color if in the hands of an impure person. They find that the beam of light headed towards a nearby mountain range, so the three decide to go there and meet Ho-oh. On their travels, they meet Bonji who tells Ash it may be his destiny to meet Ho-oh. That night, Sorrel tells a tragic story from his past; his family owned a Luxray which was a very good friend to him. One night, he got lost and injured in a snowstorm and was lying helpless when Luxray found him and curled up around him to keep his body warn in the cold weather. Although Sorrel survived, Luxray froze to death and following that Sorrel found it hard to trust Pokémon since he knew they would eventually have to leave him. Sometime later, Ash uses Charmander to battle a lady's Jigglypuff. Charmander wins and evolves into a Charmeleon.Sometime later, Ash is battling a trainer's Snorlax with Pikachu who manages to win using an Iron Tail/Thunderbolt combo. Ash is ready to take on another challenger when none other than Cross arrives. Determined to show the arrogant trainer a thing or two, Ash uses Charmeleon in the battle against Cross' strongest Pokémon, Incineroar. Charmeleon starts off strong and hits Incineroar with powerful attacks; however, Incineroar simply absorbs them then uses the energy to fight back and manages to completely thrash Charmeleon. Ash tells Charmeleon to fight back, but Charmeleon is out of energy and can't produce its fire. Ash doesn't notice his Pokémon is struggling badly and wants to continue the battle, and as a result, Charmelon is badly injured by Incineroar. Cross gives Ash a verbal beat down, telling him he's the worst trainer he's ever faced, and raw strength is all that matters when it comes to Pokémon. Ash takes Charmeleon to a Pokémon Center where it is healed, but Cross' words are still ringing in his ears, and he tells the others that if he'd battled with Pikachu instead of Charmeleon, then he would have won the battle. Verity and Sorrel are shocked, warning Ash that Charmeleon would be hurt if it heard those words, but Ash doesn't care and runs away into a forest trying to lose them. Pikachu follows but Ash just wants to be left alone and, in the heat of the moment, says that he wishes he'd been able to start his journey with Squirtle as he'd planned. Pikachu is hurt by these words, and when Ash turns around Pikachu is gone while the Rainbow Wing starts to darken in response to the severe change of attitude. Marshadow emerges from Ash's shadow and hypnotizes him, causing the young trainer to fall asleep and dream...Ash wakes up at home on the morning he began his Pokémon journey, except he's living in a world where Pokémon don't exist and he's late for school this time. He heads there (where he is once again behind everyone else) and finds himself in class with Verity and Sorrel. During the day he sees Pikachu's essence running about but can't remember what it is. Later, he looks into the distance and tells Verity and Sorrel that he'd like to go on a journey and see the world. Just then Verity and Sorrel vanish, and Ash sees Pikachu's essence and runs after it desperately to catch it only to find himself falling. Ash wakes up back in the forest and finds Pikachu in front of him with Sorrel and Verity who have been searching for him for hours. Ash apologizes to Pikachu and Charmeleon (through his Poké Ball) for what he said, and the friends all make up as the Rainbow Wing returns to its usual colors. Pikachu then spots Marshadow's eyes watching and tries to use Thunderbolt on it, but the tree Ash is lying against conducts the electricity and sends it throughout the forest causing many angry Primeape to fall from the trees and attack. Everyone tries to run, but the Primeape catch up and start throwing everyone into the air. Verity warns Ash that directly attacking the Primeape will make them angrier and more powerful to Ash sends out Metapod and ties them up with String Shot. They then run away, and during the escape, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. Meanwhile, Team Rocket run into the Primeape and are thrown into the air instead (seriously, their whole role in this movie is just encountering the Pokémon Ash has and getting blasted off... he never even knows anyone is following him).Emerging from the forest, the gang see a Pink Butterfree being attacked by a Fearow. Ash uses his Butterfree to save it, and both Butterfree are taken with each other. Following them, Ash and the others see Raikou briefly then emerge onto a cliff where they spot hundreds of Butterfree preparing to head south to spawn. Ash's Butterfree and the Pink Butterfree do a courtship dance, and Ash is delighted the two have decided to get together until he realizes that if he lets Butterfree proceed with its mate, he'll never see it again. Despite wanting Butterfree to stay with him badly, Ash decides letting it go is the right thing to go. He does so, and tries (in vain) to fight back tears as he sees his friend leave.The three trainers reach the mountain range where Ho-oh live, and the Rainbow Wing points Ash towards Mt. Tengan, the highest point where Ho-oh is known to visit. As they near the top, Bonji appears again and tells Ash that a rainbow flower is blooming (in reality, a rock is glowing with the colors of a rainbow) and if he touches the flower with the wing then Ho-oh is certain to appear. Bonji then tells them that Marshadow usually accompanies, judges and guides trainers who are wanting to meet Ho-oh. What no-one realizes is that Cross has heard everything, and he makes an attempt to steal the Rainbow Wing from Ash, telling him that he also saw Ho-oh when he started his journey but he wasn't left with a Rainbow Wing and doesn't understand how he isn't worthy to meet it. Cross sends out Incineroar, and Ash sends out Charmeleon for a rematch. This time, Charmeleon is a lot stronger and during the match evolves into Charizard. Using its new power and ability to fly, Charizard manages to soundly defeat Incineroar. Ash tells Cross that he isn't on his journey just to become more powerful but also wants to make new friends. This just further angers Cross, who tussles with Ash and steals the Rainbow Wing as he declares he intends to crush Ho-oh. However Cross fails to notice the Rainbow Wing darkening in his hand, and when he touches the flower with it, the rock also turns black and sends out dark energy. Marshadow picks up the darkened Rainbow Wing and is furious this was allowed to happen and attacks the trainers by taking control of all the nearby wild Pokémon as well as Cross' Lycanroc.Ash tries to stop Marshadow and approaches it, covered by Verity, Sorrel, and Cross. Ash battles Marshadow with Pikachu while Charizard and the other trainers Pokémon battle the ones under Marshadow's control. Cross tries to protect Ash from Lycanroc (with Charizard protecting Cross, showing it still had some loyalty towards its former trainer) and is bitten on the arm for his trouble; however Cross reminds Lycanroc this happened on the day they met, which helps snap Lycanroc out of its trance. Pikachu battles Marshadow hard, but is unable to defeat it and is wounded in the process. The wild Pokémon try to attack Pikachu as it lies helpless, but Ash shields it with his body and is also hurt. As the Rainbow Wing disintegrates and the Pokémon prepare to attack again, Ash lies next to Pikachu and asks it to get into its Poké Ball. Pikachu refuses, and Ash asks it why it never wants to go inside... and Pikachu answers (as in, actually SPEAKS ENGLISH!) that it won't go inside as it wants to stay at Ash's side forever. Ash stands up and protects Pikachu, just like he did against the Spearow, and when the Pokémon fire their attacks Pikachu tries to jump off Ash's shoulder again as it did before... but this time, it stumbles and falls. A weakened Ash catches Pikachu and finally manages to return it to its Poké Ball just before he takes the full force of the attack. Pikachu instantly comes back outside the Poké Ball and sees Ash lying dead and fading away. Pikachu and the other trainers watch devastated as Ash's body disappears.Ash wakes up where he fell but finds no-one around (he is now in some form of afterlife) and calls out for Pikachu. Suddenly a tunnel appears, and Ash starts to run through it, as in the real world a portal appears in front of Pikachu from which Ash's voice emerges. Ash runs through the portal which turns rainbow colored (its implied that Ho-oh is restoring Ash to life as it did the Legendary Beasts) as Pikachu jumps through. Ash and Pikachu are reunited and emerge back into the real world, and Marshadow forgets its anger as the Rainbow Wing is restored in Ash's hand. The rainbow flower blooms again and this time Ash, now unhindered by Cross, succeeds in touching the flower with the wing. Ho-oh appears and flies over the mountain, and Ash challenges it to a battle. Ho-oh accepts, and it begins to battle Pikachu. Obviously, Pikachu loses but Ash doesn't mind; he's just happy to have met Ho-oh properly. The gang bid farewell to Bonji who looks forward to the day he can see Ho-oh again.Ash makes amends with Cross, and the two (now friendly) rivals agree to battle again someday. He then parts ways with Verity and Sorrel, as Verity decides to head home and visit her mom and Sorrel wants to investigate the Legendary Birds (Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres). Moving on, Ash and Pikachu continue their Pokémon journey, as scenes from Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola play on screen and the narrator promises that the two have many more adventures to come.Over the closing credits, images are shown of all of Ash's traveling companions from the TV series. Ash is then seen preparing to battle a Heracross, as Verity travels on a ship bound for Sinnoh and Sorrel manages to see Articuno."
Papillon,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5093026/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Wrongfully convicted for murder, Henri Charriere forms an unlikely relationship with fellow inmate and quirky convicted counterfeiter, Louis Dega, in an attempt to escape from the notorious penal colony on Devil's Island. Based on the international best-selling autobiographical books ""Papillon"" and ""Banco"", PAPILLON follows the epic story of Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière (Charlie Hunnam), a safecracker from the Parisian underworld who is framed for murder and condemned to life in the notorious penal colony on Devil's Island. Determined to regain his freedom, Papillon forms an unlikely alliance with quirky convicted counterfeiter Louis Dega (Rami Malek), who in exchange for protection, agrees to finance Papillon's escape. Framed for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in the nightmarish penal colony on Devil's Island, off the coast of French Guiana, the Parisian safe-breakerHenri Charrière, otherwise known as Papillon from his distinctive butterfly tattoo on his chest, is with his back to the wall. Faced with a fate worse than death, Papillon soon cuts a deal with the notorious forger, Louis Dega, and without delay, he plans their escape, even though solitary confinement awaits those who try to get away. However, there is no such thing as a foolproof plan. How far isHenri Charrièrewilling to go in the name of freedom?—Nick Riganas 1931. Henri Charriere AKA Papillon is a professional Parisian safecracker. His usual day consists of breaking into mansions, stealing expensive jewelry and delivering it to his boss. In return, he was well paid. One day, after a successful robbery, he meets his boss and gives him the diamonds he has just robbed. The latter inquired if he had kept some of the diamonds for himself, but Papillon declined. The boss then brought up a badly beaten man and explained that anyone who lied to him would suffer the same consequences. Papillon was clearly intimidated by the sight, but he remained calm and walked away with the payment. Soon, he meets his wife; Nenette, and gave her the jewelry he had hidden from his boss. As they walked, a man noticed them, especially the necklace Nenette was holding. That night, the couple discussed their future. Nenette wanted to settle down in the countryside, away from the criminal world, but Papillon figured they wouldn't make enough money there. The next morning, as the two continued their discussion, there was a sudden knock on the door. As soon as Papillon opened it, a group of police officers arrested him. He is charged with murder of the same person his boss had beaten up last night. Papillon tries to explain that he has been with his wife all night, but the police ignored his pleas and took him away. Later, at the police station, Papillon is visited by Nenette, who claims to want to testify. However, he stops her and says it won't help. Papillon knows that no matter what he does, the police won't let him go. So instead, he planned a prison break. Before leaving, Papillon tells his girlfriend to move on with her life, but she refuses. After Nenette leaves, Papillon befriends a fellow inmate named Julot, who reveals that escaping from prison costs a lot of money. He then points to a seemingly innocuous man named Louis Dega and says ""he is the solution."" Apparently Dega is a millionaire who was arrested for making counterfeit money. Even now he has hidden a lot of money in a place where the sun never shines.During this time, all prisoners are being taken by boat to the penal colony of French Guiana. At night, Papillon approaches Dega and offers to protect him for money, but he refuses. Late at night, while all the prisoners are resting, Dega notices that the guy next to him has been brutally murdered. Turns out he had some money hidden in his stomach, and that's why he became a target. Dega was so frightened by the incident that the next morning he went to Papillon and accepted the offer. The deal was that Dega would be protected until he reaches the penal colony. He doesn't want to run away with Papillon, because he thinks his wife will get him out soon. Then while everyone was resting, the last night's killer targeted Dega. He slowly advanced to punch his victim, but this time Papillon came to the rescue. The two engage in a fight, this warns the officers. Papillon was punished, but he doesn't seem to care. He's just glad Dega wasn't killed. The next morning, the boat finally reached the prison. Before everyone could continue, Juliet purposely injured himself in order to be taken to the infirmary. His plan is to escape from there, as the infirmary is the least protected place. After a while, Papillon and the others finally reach the colony where they will be imprisoned . The place is full of deadly criminals, many of whom have been charged with murder. The prison warden is also an evil man. He gathers all the new prisoners and reveals that escaping from the place is impossible. If someone is caught, they will be held in solitary confinement for 2 years. If they are caught for the second time, quarantine for 3 years. And if caught escaping a third time, they will be sent to the infamous ""Demon Island"", a place where people go crazy. The director also explained that if someone committed murder, they would be publicly beheaded on the guillotine. In the next scene, all the prisoners are tasked with picking up rocks. While Papillon does this effectively, Dega is struggling to cope up, because he is not used to labor. Later, Papillon meets a boatman and offers him a large amount of cash in exchange for a boat. The man agreed and told Papillon to arrive at the shore the next night. Soon after, a dangerous-looking prisoner discovers the plan and approaches Dega to take his money. But even now, Papillon has come to the rescue. He fights the man and defeats him, though he is wounded in the process. Seeing this, Dega realized that he wouldn't be able to survive even a day without Papillon. By the time his wife finds a way to get him out, he will be long dead. So with no other choice, Dega also joins Papillon in his escape plan. The next morning, all the prisoners were summoned to the yard to witness an execution. It turns out that while trying to escape, Julot killed two guards. He will be punished with a guillotine. As all the prisoners watched in horror, Julot is fitted to the device and decapitated. The warden then orders Papillon and Dega to bring the corpse to the burial site. Unfortunately, on the way, Dega broke down. He had never even seen a dead body in his life, but now they made him carry a headless man. Papillon encouraged him to get up, but to no avail. Soon after, the guards also came and threatened Dega to pick up the body. When he refused, one of them began to whip him in the back. Papillon couldn't take it anymore, so in a fit of rage, he picked up a rock and hit the guard on the head. Then he ran away, but poor Dega couldn't move even an inch out of fear. At night, Papillon came to the shore and met the boatman. He asked for the boat, but to his surprise the man started laughing. When Papillon turned around, he noticed some guards. It turned out that the boatman had foretold the prison warden of the escape. He receives a decent amount of money every time he provides information about a prisoner trying to escape. Soon after, Papillon is taken back to prison, and the director gives him the good news. The guard he punched earlier is still alive, which means Papillon won't be sentenced to death. Instead, he will be held in solitary confinement on another island. When he arrived, he found the place deserted and dark. There is only one rule; don't make noise. In the old prison, inmates could walk around and chat with their friends, but in this prison, they were kept in a small room. Even talking to yourself is a punishable offense here. Also, the food was not enough and very bad. Papillon received only one meal, which was a strange soup. But one day, all of a sudden, he received a coconut. Inside there is a note mentioning that he will now get coconuts every day. Realizing it was Dega's, Papillon happily ate the meal. This lasted for several weeks, but the warden eventually discovered and killed the guard serving the food. He then confronts Papillon and asks who is responsible. As expected, the latter part reveals nothing. As a punishment, the warden halved his already inadequate ration. A month has passed; Papillon has become very weak due to lack of nutrients in his body. The warden approached him again with a delicious meal in hand and asked who sent him the coconut. But as before, Papillon remained silent. Enraged, the warden decided to leave him in the dark for the rest of the sentence. Now Papillon is left in a terrifying situation; He didn't have enough food, he didn't have anyone to talk to, and he couldn't even see his surroundings. Gradually, the quietness and lack of suitable food began to drive him crazy. Papillon became so weak that he couldn't move, so he was taken to the prison hospital. Coincidentally, Dega started working at the same place. Over the past year and a half, he has earned the trust of the director, giving him extra protection and privileges. One day, Dega meets his friend and learns that he is only pretending to be crazy. Papillon knew it was the only way back to prison, so he started acting like a maniac. The duo then began to discuss their escape plan again. This time, they chose two other prisoners as effective assistants. Papillon wants someone strong and cunning, while Dega wants to help someone who is constantly being taken advantage of. In the end, they recruit a bully named Celier and a guy who gets bullied all the time; Mature. Dega then gives all of his savings to Celier, who uses his connections to buy a boat. The next night, a movie will be shown, and that's when the quartet plans to escape. Dega was worried about the whole thing, and at one point even considered backing out. However, Papillon, making him understand that it was their only chance of freedom. Now or never. In the next scene, we are taken to the movie night show. Several officials arrived and Dega served them drinks. According to the plan, he drugged them and waited for the perfect moment to steal the key to the main gate. Inside, Papillon and the others were waiting for Dega to return when suddenly it started to rain. This causes a power outage. Frightened, Celier suggested they run away and find another route, but Papillon refused. He won't leave without his friend. Luckily, Dega arrived just in time with the key. Taking advantage of the dark, the group broke open the main door and quickly escaped from the prison. After a while, they came to an impasse; The only way to get to the shore is to jump. Papillon, Celier and Maturrete successfully land, but when it's Dega's turn, the lights suddenly come back on. This startled him, causing him to land awkwardly and break his leg. Now that he can't walk, Celier offers them to let him stay, but Papillon again refuses. He, along with Maturette carry the wounded Dega and eventually reach the shore, where a boat is waiting for them. Without wasting time, the four jumped on board and sailed into the darkness of the ocean. The next morning, hours had passed since their escape, but Celier notes that they still haven't reached very far. This is because the boat is very small and cannot support the weight of four people. At that time, they saw a storm approaching them. Realizing they have very little time, Celier throws Maturette into the sea, then goes after Dega. However, Papillon got in the way, leading to a brutal fight. Celier, being the taller man, got the upper hand and was about to kill Papillon when suddenly Dega stabbed him from behind. The duo then threw him off the boat and helped Maturette climb back up. After a while, the great storm engulfed them and the screen turned black. When they wake up, they find themselves on an island. It turned out that a nearby community had seen them floating in the ocean and saved them. As the confused Papillon wanders around, a nun greets him and reveals that they are in Colombia. She also mentioned that she knew what they did and where they came from. Papillon tries to explain himself, but the nun says he is safe, as long as he repents for his sins. That night, Papillon meets his best friend and tells him they must leave immediately. However, Dega refused, saying their deal was over. He was tired of running and now just wanted to stay in one place forever.Therefore, Papillon decided to leave this place alone. But as he approached the boat, he noticed two officers stopping. It turned out that the evil nun had offered her position to the authorities. Alarmed, Papillon quickly returns to Dega and helps him up, but by then the officers had noticed them. Maturette is shot immediately while Papillon and Dega are captured and sent back to prison again. Cut to five years later, Papillon has served his prison term in solitary confinement, and now he's been sent to Devil's Island. To his surprise, he finds Dega there. It was revealed that he received a harsher punishment because he spiked the drinks of the officers. Dega was brought to Devil's Island shortly after returning from Colombia. Both are happy to reunite after 5 long years. They may have aged, but the friendship and bond are still the same. That evening, as Papillon looked out at the sea, an idea popped into his head. He approached Dega and told him that if they could make a small raft, the waves would take them to the nearest shore. However, this time, Dega refused to participate. He explained that for the past 5 years, he has lived a peaceful life, without any disturbance or violence. He also learns that his wife is already married to someone else, so there is no need to go back. However, he decided to help Papillon make the coconut raft. The next morning, the two friends hugged and said goodbye. Papillon then threw the raft into the sea before jumping on himself. The plan is working and the waves seem to be taking him somewhere. As he walked away, Dega was in tears. In the final scene, we are transported to the year 1967. Papillon currently lives in Venezuela, as he is still a wanted criminal in France. But in 1969, he was pardoned for all his crimes. Papillon wrote a memoir of all the events, which he now plans to publish. The film ends when he arrives in Paris for the first time in 38 long years."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5715874/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Steven, a charismatic surgeon, is forced to make an unthinkable sacrifice after his life starts to fall apart, when the behavior of a teenage boy he has taken under his wing turns sinister. After the untimely death of 16-year-old Martin's father on the operating table, little by little, a deep and empathetic bond begins to form between him and the respected cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Steven Murphy. At first, expensive gifts and then an invitation for dinner will soon earn the orphaned teenager the approval of Dr Steven's perfect family, even though right from the start, a vague, yet unnerving feeling overshadows Martin's honest intent. And then, unexpectedly, the idyllic family is smote by a fierce and pitiless punishment, while at the same time, everything will start falling apart as the innocents have to suffer. In the end, as the sins of one burden the entire family, only an unimaginable and unendurable decision that demands a pure sacrifice can purge the soul. But to find catharsis, one must first admit the sin.—Nick Riganas Dr. Steven Murphy is a renowned cardiovascular surgeon who presides over a spotless household with his wife and two children. Lurking at the margins of his idyllic suburban existence is Martin, a fatherless teen who insinuates himself into the doctor's life in gradually unsettling ways. Soon, the full scope of Martin's intent becomes menacingly clear when he confronts Steven with a long-forgotten transgression that will shatter his domestic bliss forever.—krmanirethnam The perfect family plan of a successful heart surgeon is thrown off balance when a 16-year-old boy forces his way into his life as a relic of the past. When he tries to escape, supernatural hauntings occur and the teenager gives the doctor a perfidious ultimatum. The film begins with Steven (Colin Farrell) performing open heart surgery. After surgery, he talks to his anesthesiologist, and they talk about watches.Steven meets Martin (Barry Keoghan) at a diner. Steven seems to be some kind of mentor to Martin, and has bought Martin the watch that he was asking the anesthesiologist about. After meeting with Martin, Steven has dinner with his family. His long-haired son, Bob, asks if he can go to a party with his sister (Steven's daughter), Kim. Steven says he can go if he cuts his hair. Steven's wife, Anna (Nicole Kidman), says just to let him go. Steven mentions that he's been spending time with a school mate of Kim's, Martin, because Martin wants to be a cardiologist. That night, Steven and Anna engage in some weird sexual act where Anna poses on the bed for him and he starts masturbating before he gets up and starts kissing her. The next night, Anna and Steven go to a gala where Steven is speaking. There, Steven gives his speech, and then we find out he doesn't drink when he is offered a cocktail.Steven invites Martin over for dinner. At this point is you start getting a vibe from Martin that he's actually really creepy and weird. We find out that Martin's father was in a car accident and died ten years earlier so now it's just him and his mom living together. Martin hangs out with Steven's children in Kim's room, and he asks them about themselves. We find out that Kim is in a choir. Kim and Martin go on a walk together, and she sings for him in front of a tree while he sits and watches. Kim and Martin begin to develop feelings for each other. Later, Steven is driving through the parking structure at the hospital and sees Martin following him. Martin asks Steven to come to dinner at his house. Steven obliges. While they're eating dinner, Martin tells Steven that after dinner, he'd like for them all to watch his and his father's favorite movie. So they do. It's Groundhog Day. Martin says he's tired so he gets up and leaves, leaving Steven alone with his mother (Alicia Silverstone). She mentions that she knows her late husband was a patient of his, and she remembers him from when she went to the hospital after the accident. She says Steven has beautiful hands and begins to kiss them and suck on his fingers and Steven gets up and leaves. A day or two later, Steven and Anna are at a BBQ at his anesthesiologist's house, and Martin calls Steven. Martin is at the diner where they usually meet and wants Steven to come meet him, but Steven says he can't.The next day, Bob is running late for school. Steven goes in to tell him to get out of bed, and Bob says he can't. He can't stand up because he can't feel his legs. He is taken to the hospital, and they run a full neurological examination on him before determining that nothing is wrong. He can walk again, and is walking out of the hospital with Anna when he collapses. He can't feel his legs again. The next day, Martin is there to visit Bob in the hospital, and Bob doesn't seem jazzed about it. Martin tells Steven to meet him in the hospital cafeteria. He tells him not to stand him up again. In the cafeteria, Martin tells Steven that because his father died on Steven's operating table, he sees him as his dad's killer. He says because Steven killed a member of his family, he'd now have to kill a member of his own family to balance it out. He tells Steven that if he doesn't, his family will all die the same way. First, by losing the use of their legs. Second, by refusing to eat to the point of starvation. Third, they'll start to bleed from their eyes. After that, it will be mere hours until they die. We see security escorting Martin out of the hospital after that. Steven goes to see Bob and asks him to eat some of his favorite donuts that Anna has brought for him. Sure enough, he refuses to eat.Later, we see Kim at choir practice where she collapses during a rehearsal of Carol of the Bells. She ends up in the hospital in the same room as Bob. She too refuses to eat. The hospital continues to run tests on the two of them and determine that according to the tests, there's nothing wrong with them. Steven tells Anna about what Martin told him. She asks him if he had been drinking the day that he operated on Martin's father. He says it's possible, but a death on an operating table is never the surgeon's fault, it's always due to a mistake by the anesthesiologist. Anna meets with the anesthesiologist, and he says he remembers Steven having two drinks the morning before operating on Martin's father. He says when someone dies it's never his fault, but the fault of the surgeon. And in return for giving this information, Anna gives him an explicit hand job inside her car. A day or two later, Anna is at the hospital with her children when Kim gets a phone call from Martin. The two have been seeing each other since they first met. He tells her to stand up and come to the window so she can see him in the parking lot. All of a sudden, she's able to stand up, and she goes to the window but doesn't see him. She starts going back to her bed, and her legs stop working again the second she hangs up the phone. A decision is made to have the children come home instead of having to stay in the hospital. Anna goes to see Martin. He tells her that he thinks Steven killed his dad and Anna asks why she and her children have to pay for Steven's mistake. He doesn't answer but says that ever since his dad died Steven has been flirting with his mother and that he thinks they would be perfect for each other.With the children home, we find out that they know about the decision Steven must make and they all start trying to flatter him to avoid having to die. Bob cuts his hair himself and says he wants to be a cardiologist. Later, Steven takes Anna down to the basement where he has Martin taped to a chair with cuts and bruises all over his face. He beats Martin to try to get him to make it stop. At night, when everyone is asleep, Kim drags herself down to the basement and asks Martin to let her walk again so they can run away together. Steven and Anna wake up and notice that Kim is not in her bed and they check every room, and she is nowhere to be found. They go down to the basement, and she's not there either. Steven asks Martin what he did to her. They start driving around the neighborhood and eventually find her dragging herself along with her knees/legs bleeding. Back at home, Steven tends to her wounds while she apologizes for going down to see him. The next day, Anna says she has set Martin free, and then Bob's eyes start bleeding. It is now time for Steven to make his choice. He tapes up his family members and puts pillowcases over their heads and then seats them in the living room. He stands in the middle of them with a rifle and pulls a beanie down over his face before spinning in a circle and firing the rifle randomly. He does this a few times, only hitting furniture in the house, until the final time when we see blood begin to stream down from under Bob's pillowcase. In the next scene, Steven, Anna, and Kim are eating in the diner where Steven used to meet with Martin. Martin walks in and sits at the bar and looks back at them. The family gets up and leaves."

Regardless of being well educated in the treatment of Indigenous people back then or not, it's certainly not comfortable to see the portrayal of what life might have been like in the residential schools, and even further what life was like on the road in our own country of Canada during those times. Like climbing a mountain, for every steep incline you think the movie is finally on the up and up, until a crashing stagnant detail hits, and the battle becomes that much more difficult for young Saul. He's so close to establishing the dream, the great feat, but against all odds, who could imagine facing this battle on one's own. All things considered, the movie is certainly not your run of the mill sports movie that progresses towards a...well you should watch for yourself and see.—Jacob Hobbins"

This tense psychological thriller follows two American soldiers (Taylor-Johnson, Cena) pinned down by an Iraqi sniper, with nothing but a crumbling wall between them. Their fight becomes as much a battle of will and wits as it is of lethally accurate marksmanship. U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews (John Cena) is a sniper, who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of Iraq, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear.

Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process.Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film; a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae.

The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.Isaac hears the rescue helicopters coming, so he pushes down the wall and uses Matthews' rifle to try and kill Juba, or at least flush him out so the rescue chopper can see the trap. Juba fires at Issac twice and misses. Issac now has the sniper's location and fires his only round. Issac stands up and waits for Juba's next shot, but it never comes. The helicopters land and the rescue team picks up Isaac and the dead Matthews. Once the helicopters dust off, the sniper successfully shoots down both in rapid succession, killing Issac and all of the American rescue soldiers in both helicopters.In the final shot, the unknown sniper is heard over the radio, calling for another rescue to set a new trap to kill more Americans."

Goodbye Christopher Robin,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1653665/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The relationship between writer AA Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, and how this became the inspiration for Winnie the Pooh. A rare glimpse into the relationship between beloved children's author A. A. Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) and his son Christopher Robin, whose toys inspired the magical world of Winnie the Pooh. Along with his mother Daphne (Margot Robbie), and his nanny Olive, Christopher Robin and his family are swept up in the international success of the books; the enchanting tales bringing hope and comfort to England after the First World War. But with the eyes of the world on Christopher Robin, what will the cost be to the family?—Fox Searchlight Pictures After fighting in World War 1, Alan Milne returns home to his wife Daphne and settles down to writing plays, poems and books. They have a son, whose nickname is Billy Moon. As Billy grows up, his and his father's wanderings in the woods near their home and their play-acting with Billy's toy animals becomes the inspiration for a series of books by Alan Milne. These books are among the most-loved and most sold children's books ever written - Winnie the Pooh. Alan Milne was better known in literary circles as AA Milne and his son was Christopher Robin Milne.—grantss The film begins during WWII in 1941, with Alan Alexander Milne - nicknamed ""Blue"" by his friends and family - and his wife Daphne receiving a distressing telegram at their home. It then changes time frame to 1916 during WWI with Blue fighting in the Battle of the Somme. He resumes his life with Daphne in England while suffering shell shock of occasional flashbacks to his battle experiences, and having a child with Daphne. She was hoping for a girl and is disappointed to instead have a son, whom they name Christopher Robin Milne but generally call ""Billy Moon"". They hire a nanny, Olive, whom Billy calls ""Nou"". Blue is having difficulty resuming his writing - he wants to draft a compelling treatise against war - and relocates the family to a house in the country with wooded acreage. Daphne resents the move and returns to London for an extended period. During that time, Olive goes to care for her dying mother and the cook takes some time off, leaving Blue and Billy to fend for themselves. Reluctantly at first, Blue takes Billy along on walks in the woods and begins making up stories about the boy's adventures with the stuffed animals the parents have bought for him.. The lives of the Milne family - Alan Milne, better known asA.A. Milne, his wife Daphne Milne, and their only offspring Christopher,C.R. Milne- between the First and Second World Wars is dramatized. Within the family context, Alan and Christopher are generally referred to by their pet names of Blue and Billy Moon, respectively. Following WWI, Blue and Daphne's marriage is strained by their differences and by the effects of the war, Blue's military service which has led to Blue suffering from PTSD and Daphne emotional distress. Those differences include Blue's want to move to the country, Sussex, from London, forgoing his successful career as a playwright to write something more substantive along the lines of an anti-war manifesto, while Daphne, in her self-absorbed mentality, wants to retain an exciting life in London, with she considering her ultimate sacrifice being having a child, Billy Moon, which is only exacerbated by the difficulties of childbirth. As neither Blue or Daphne are mentally equipped to be parents, Billy Moon is largely under the care of a nanny, Olive Rand, who Billy Moon refers to as Nou. While there had been moments of love and affection within the family, one of the most prolonged is when Blue is forced to care for Billy Moon on his own, the two spending much time together in the woods coming up with stories about Billy Moon's stuffed animals and Billy Moon's trips to the zoo with Nou to visit a black bear there named Winnipeg. This time together leads to Blue writing the Winnie the Pooh series of children's books. The books become wildly successful as a panacea for the world's post-war woes, only putting Billy Moon in the unwanted spotlight as the real life ""Christopher Robin"", he knowing people only clamoring after him because of the books and not because of him as a person. This exposure hurts even more as Billy Moon originally saw the stories as the secret world solely between father and son. What happens due to the books' success leads to a greater fracture not only within the family but also with Nou who arguably has more of Billy Moon's best interest at heart than his parents. The question then becomes whether the comfort that the books have brought to the public in general will ever translate back to the Milne family.—Huggo"

In the end, will those cloistered Sisters finally find out what they had been missing for all these years?—Nick Riganas The film opens on a pastoral forest scene in the 14th Century Italy. Sister Fernanda (Aubrey Plaza), dressed head to toe in full winter habit, is leading a donkey through the trees, and ultimately through a field and back to her convent where she puts it back into its stall. She is confronted by Sister Genevra (Kate Micucci), who asks why she is in her winter garb in the heat of summer. She wants to know how the donkey keeps getting free, and they argue.They head back toward the housing part of the convent and pass by the groundskeeper, who offers them a pleasant greeting. In response, they hurl obscenities at him. They've told him never to speak to or look at them again, yet he continues to do so, and they are furious. They physically assault him with vegetables and farming tools.We cut to a castle, where Lord Bruno (Nick Offerman) is having dinner with his wife, Francesca (Lauren Weedman). He is babbling on and on about finances and wars with other lands, and she is clearly irritated. She responds sarcastically to everything he says, and she keeps making eye contact with manservant Massetto (Dave Franco) who stands nearby. Guards Gregorio and Paolo stand watch, and everyone in the room is exasperated by Lord Bruno's nonstop talking. It is clear from the looks they exchange that Massetto and Francesca are involved.We cut to later in the evening. Francesca and Massetto are in bed, having just made love. She complains about how boring and awful her husband is. She hears various noises and is concerned he is about to walk in on them, but she also won't stop complaining about him. Massetto says she is just as bad as he is, only her complaining is about her husband's complaining. She says Massetto sounds just like her husband, and Massetto mounts her again primarily to make her shut up. They hear another noise, and this time it is, in fact, Lord Bruno entering the room.Massetto escapes through the window and runs back to to the servant's quarters. Lord Bruno follows, but Massetto leaps into bed and pretends to be sleeping. Lord Bruno puts his hand on the chest of all of his servants, and detects Massetto's increased heartbeat. It is too dark to determine who is whom, so he cuts off Massetto's ponytail and whispers ""Now I will know who you are in the morning."" After Lord Bruno leaves, Massetto cuts off the ponytails of all of the other servants.In the morning, Lord Bruno is furious at this betrayal. Later in the day, Francesca corners Massetto in the garden and tries to initiate sex. She has completely lost any sense of discretion, and as a result, Lord Bruno sees them out in the open and sends his guards to accost Massetto, telling them to cut off his balls. Massetto flees into the forest.Back at the convent, prim and proper sister Alessandra (Alison Brie) is weaving and embroidering fabrics. Father Tommasso (John C. Reilly) gathers them with the intention of taking them to market to sell. Fernanda and Genevra discuss that Alessandra is only in the convent because her wealthy father donates money to it. Tommasso converses with Mother Superior and Sister Marea (Molly Shannon), that Alessandra may not be the best fit for the convent. As he leaves to go to market, he is confronted by the groundskeeper, who quits his job because of the ongoing abuse. Tommasso begs him to stay just long enough for him to return from the market but he refuses.In the woods, Massetto continues to flee when he stumbles upon Tommasso. Tommasso is drunk, and his cart has overturned, sending all of the fabrics into the rushing river. Massetto takes pity on him and gathers up the soaked fabrics. In return, Tommasso offers him shelter for the night at the convent. They agree that he will take on the groundskeeper position, and concoct a ruse wherein he will pretend to be mute and deaf. That way the sisters will have no reason to be angry or abusive toward him.They return to the convent, and the next morning Tommasso introduces Massetto to Marea. She seems wary at first but agrees to take him on as the groundskeeper. Tommasso also lies and says he was accosted by thieves who stole all of the fabric he went to sell. Genevra barges in and complains that the donkey is always getting loose, and asks Marea to give her the responsibility of taking care of it in the future. Alessandra gets a visit from her father, Ilario. They communicate through a wall with holes in it. He says he is having trouble finding her a husband, partially because the family business is suffering and he cannot come up with a dowry. He says it would be cheaper for her to stay at the convent and have him continue to give them donations. Alessandra is distressed.Fernanda comes upon Massetto in the courtyard. Not recognizing him, she becomes irate and pulls a weapon on him, demanding to know his identity. Marea comes upon the scene and tells her he is the new groundskeeper, urging her to back off. The younger sisters are wary of him, but at the same time curious at his presence.That evening someone throws stones at Fernanda's window. It's her friend Marta, whom she lets in and dresses in a habit. The two lay in bed drinking sacrificial wine, and Alessandra joins them. Curious at the commotion, Genevra shows up and reluctantly drinks with them. Marta mentions that she has heard of a way to use belladonna to concoct a potion that will seduce men.They all get drunk, and Marta and Fernanda begin to kiss and grope each other. Genevra is concerned but secretly interested, so they bring her into the encounter, but she is so drunk they must return her to her room. Genevra and Fernanda have sex.In the morning, Marta and Fernanda go into the woods and create a belladonna potion. Marta warns her not to drink it. Marta puts two small drops of it into each of Fernanda's eyes. She cuts Fernanda's finger and uses the blood to rouge her cheeks. Genevra hides nearby and witnesses this. Fernanda and Marta burst into Massetto's living quarters and sexually assault him. They disrobe him and fondle his genitals, kneeling down and smelling them. Fernanda mounts him and dry humps him, but then the women leave. Shortly after that Alessandra enters and begins complaining about her life to Massetto, thinking he cannot hear her. She then seduces and has sex with him.The next day, Bishop Bartolomeo (Fred Armisen) comes to visit the convent. Tommasso and Marea give him a tour. Genevra goes into the wine cellar and makes the belladonna potion, but drinks it and begins to hallucinate. Massetto sneaks into Alessandra's room, and they begin to have sex when an elderly nun enters the room, seeming not to notice. Alessandra gathers herself and goes over to sit by the older nun, and the two begin to embroider fabrics as Massetto hides under the bed. He attempts to sneak out the window until Tommasso, Maera and Bartolomeo briefly enter the room as part of the tour. After they leave, he escapes, but in his shock, he briefly speaks.He retreats to his quarters, where Alessandra confronts him about lying about his deaf and muteness. He apologizes, and they begin to have sex again. Outside, Genevra violently cuts her hand and smears blood on her face, emulating the more subtle rouging Fernanda applied. Genevra bursts into Massetto's quarters, high on belladonna, and Alessandra leaps behind a wall to hide. Genevra attempts to seduce him but doesn't know what she is doing, and then she realizes and confesses she is gay.Just then Marta and Fernanda burst in, and Genevra leaps behind the same wall where Alessandra is hiding. Fernanda puts a knife to Massetto's throat, binds his hands and blindfolds him and leads him away into the woods. Genevra and Alessandra follow and discover a coven of nude witches dancing around a bonfire. Massetto is tied to an altar where Fernanda is once again dry humping him. They intend to kill him in a ritual sacrifice, until Genevra, in her drug induced state, runs into the midst and starts screaming at and attacking the witches. Marta attempts to calm her down, but Genevra bludgeons Marta in the head with a huge totem stick. Alessandra intervenes with Fernanda and stops her from murdering Massetto, who begins to speak and reveals his ruse to everyone. Genevra tearfully confesses that not only is she gay, she is also Jewish.Genevra runs, nude and covered in blood, back to the convent and begins banging on everyone's doors screaming for help. She bangs on Marea's door who calls out ""Be out in a minute!,"" and ultimately awakens Bartolomeo. The other sisters catch up with Genevraand everyone begins accusing each other of sins. Genevra says Fernanda is a witch, and Fernanda reveals Genevra is a lesbian and Jewish. Just then Tommasso and Marea emerge from her bedroom, and it is clear that they were having sex.The next morning everyone is forced to confess to Bartolomeo where he reads out the lists of their numerous sins and offenses. They are all given penance, and Tommasso's priesthood is stripped, and he is sent away to be a monk at a monastery. Massetto is sent back to the castle of Lord Bruno where he is imprisoned.The younger sisters sit out in a field of flowers and apologize for betraying one another, but worry about Massetto's safety.Back in prison Lord Bruno tells Massetto he is going to keep him there and alive for as long as possible, slowly torturing him with rats. He says he has sealed Francesca up in a wall with a ""boar and a dog"" as she turned out to be from an enemy village and barren, but he has a new wife who will be a better lover once she reaches puberty. When he leaves, Massetto pleads with Paolo and Gregorio to free him, but the refuse and instead mock and tease him. A turtle with a candle on it's back walks by (brought by the nuns as a distraction), and the guards follow it in wonder. Alessandra, Genera, and Fernanda appear and free Massetto. They leave a dummy in his place and dress him in a nun's habit, escaping the castle together.Out in the woods, Marea is taking the donkey to meet with Tommasso. They embrace and confess their love for one another. Just then the sisters come running by with Massetto, so Tommasso and Marea duck and hide. Running by, Fernanda stops and sees the donkey standing alone. She considers it curiously for a lingering moment until Genevra doubles back and grabs her, urging her to continue with them. They run off into the woods, and the film suddenly ends on this note."

The Square,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4995790/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A prestigious Stockholm museum's chief art curator finds himself in times of both professional and personal crisis as he attempts to set up a controversial new exhibit. Christian is the respected curator of a contemporary art museum, a divorced but devoted father of two who drives an electric car and supports good causes. His next show is ""The Square"", an installation which invites passersby to altruism, reminding them of their role as responsible fellow human beings. But sometimes, it is difficult to live up to your own ideals: Christian's foolish response to the theft of his phone drags him into shameful situations. Meanwhile, the museum's PR agency has created an unexpected campaign for ""The Square"". The response is overblown and sends Christian, as well as the museum, into an existential crisis. Successful, self-confident, and charming in his impeccable suits, Christian, the reputable chief curator for Stockholm's contemporary art X-Royal Museum, knows how to enjoy the good life. However, after falling victim to an intricate pick-pocketing scam, Christian's whole existence will go into meltdown, as he decides to follow a rather unorthodox way to recover his stolen property. And, mistake after mistake, the desperate art connoisseur is doomed to do the exact opposite of what The Square represents--his latest cutting-edge project--to remedy this unfortunate situation; but, at what cost? Under those circumstances, is the Square nothing more than a hideous simulation of a rapidly deteriorating social reality?—Nick Riganas In control of everything of which he is in charge making him generally calculating, Christian Nielsen is the chief curator at X-Royal, a modern and contemporary art museum in Stockholm, it housed in one part of the former royal palace. Confidence, which he outwardly possesses in spades, is required to woo potential investors, he up front in an interview that the museum does not have the capital of many of the world's private collectors in bidding for and purchasing the top art. With the current exhibits, like the video series by performance artist Oleg Rogozjin highlighting beasts' relationship to mankind, or the featured exhibit titled ""Mirrors and Piles of Gravel"" by Julian Gijoni generating little foot traffic, he is placing much effort into an upcoming exhibit by Lola Arias, the collection which she has titled ""The Square"", which is meant to symbolize equality and thus a place of safety but obligation for anyone in the space. The museum has commissioned a marketing company to come up with a strategy to promote the exhibit. Christian's controlled world has the potential to go horribly off the rails as he tries to juggle many balls, he placing priority on certain of those balls over others. They include: approving the marketing concept for the exhibit, the PR firm trying to come up with something provocative as the artist's statement on the piece is too motherhood in nature to wrap a media strategy around; dealing with the aftermath of what he assumed was a one-night stand with someone he met in a professional context; keeping to his child care responsibilities to his two daughters, Lise and Lilli; and with the help of one of his assistants Michael, trying, somewhat covertly, to get back his wallet, cell phone and cuff-links, which he realized after the fact were stolen in a con and not just merely lost. Added to the problems is one of his artists having a mind of his own at a black tie banquet for the museum.—Huggo"

One man stands in their way: Winston Churchill. Behind the iconic figure and rousing speeches: a man who has faced political ridicule, military failure and a speech impediment.

Fearful of repeating, on his disastrous command, the mass slaughter of 1915, when hundreds of thousands of young men were cut down on the beaches of Gallipoli. Obsessed with fulfilling historical greatness: his destiny. Exhausted by years of war and plagued by depression, Churchill is a shadow of the hero who has resisted Hitler's Blitzkrieg. Should the D-Day landings fail, he is terrified he'll be remembered as an architect of carnage. Political opponents sharpen their knives. General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Montgomery are increasingly frustrated by Churchill's attempts to stop the invasion. King George VI must intervene. Only the support of Churchill's brilliant, yet exasperated wife Clementine can halt the Prime Minister's physical and mental collapse. The untold story of Britain's most celebrated leader, uncovering the true nature of Churchill's herculean war-time status and his vital relationship with ""Clemmie"" - his backbone and total confidant...the love that inspired him to greatness.

Tony Webster, an ageing Londoner and vintage camera shop owner, whittles down the solitude of his isolated existence by keeping an affectionate relationship with his ex-wife, Margaret, and by accompanying his nearly full-term pregnant daughter, Susie, to antenatal courses. However, the unexpected arrival of an unsettling letter will disrupt the delicate balance of things in Tony's orderly life, reconnecting him with his first love from college, Veronica, and the nostalgic yet clouded memories of a distant past. Now, as Tony scavenges for bits and pieces through flashbacks, more and more, the out-of-focus picture of his youth sharpens; nevertheless, is he ready to face the truth?—Nick Riganas An elderly divorce Anthony 'Tony' Webster (Jim Broadbent) runs a camera shop in London and lives a mostly sedate life. One day, his ex-wife, Margaret (Harriet Walter) asks him to accompany their pregnant daughter, Susie (Michelle Dockery) to her prenatal birthing class. After dropping her home, he reads a letter he has received earlier that day. It is from the estate of the recently deceased Mrs. Sarah Ford, the mother of a former girlfriend whom he met in the 1960s while at university. He is left 500 pounds and two documents, the first is a letter somewhat explaining an unwarranted gift. The second document is still with Tony's former girlfriend and Sarah's daughter, Veronica Ford. Tony is confused why the mother of an ex-girlfriend whom he only met once decades ago would leave him something in her will.. Just as his daughter is about to give birth, Tony (Broadbent) receives a letter from his first love. The contents of the parcel forces him to confront an old secret, and reckon with longstanding regrets. An adaptation of the Booker Prize-winning novel by Julian Barnes. Elderly Tony Webster (Jim Broadbent) suffers from repressed memory. He runs a camera shop in London and lives a mostly sedate life. One day, his ex-wife Margaret (Harriet Walter) asks him to accompany their pregnant daughter, Susie (Michelle Dockery) to her prenatal birthing class. After dropping Susie home, he reads a letter he has received earlier that day from a lawyer relating to the estate of the recently deceased Mrs Sarah Ford, the mother of his first love Veronica back from high school days.
Tony goes to meet the lawyer Eleanor Marriott (Karina Fernandez) and learns that he has been left 500 pounds and two documents. The first document is a letter somewhat explaining the unwarranted gift; the second is a diary which is still with Veronica Ford. The lawyer cannot disclose Veronica's contact information to Tony without her consent.
While having lunch with his ex-wife Margaret at a diner, Tony reveals for the first time his relationship with Veronica and his one-time meeting with her mother, Sarah. Margaret jokingly asks which one of them he did sleep with.
Tony continues with his story. As he scavenges for bits and pieces through flashbacks, the out-of-focus picture of his youth gradually sharpens. One weekend, Veronica (Freya Mavor) invited him, then a university freshman, to meet her family at home. Tony was highly uncomfortable all weekend, especially with Veronica's father David (James Wilby) and her brother Jack (Edward Holcroft), both of whom were pleasant enough but seemed to Tony to be treating him with barely disguised contempt. Veronica also seemed to be distancing herself from him. On Saturday morning he had a rather strange conversation with Veronica's mother, Sarah Ford (Emily Mortimer), who seemed to him artistic, casual, and carefree, and warned him not to let Veronica get away with too much. Tony goes through his vague memories from that weekend, but can't think of anything significant.
Tony meets the lawyer again and is told that the diary belonged to Adrian Finn, a former classmate. He goes to visit his ex-wife and reminisces about his last year at high school.
In Sixth Form, Tony (Billy Howle) was a handsome but self-conscious young man. He and his two best friends, Colin Simpson (Jack Loxton) and Alex Stuart (Timothy Innes), accepted a new member into their group, Adrian Finn (Joe Alwyn), a highly intelligent boy who enjoyed arguing with their teacher. During their time at school a classmate, Robson, died from what many believed to be suicide after his girlfriend became pregnant. The four friends discussed the philosophical meaning of suicide. Tony was greatly impressed by Adrian when the latter made a clever comment in history class with their teacher Joe Hunt (Matthew Goode), using Robson's suicide as his example. Tony complimented Adrian, but was surprised when Adrian seemed to take the comment seriously rather than deflecting it ironically.
Tony recalls that the four friends dispersed after they graduated from high school. Veronica and Tony continued dating during their undergrad years. Tony was eager to have 'full sex' with Veronica, who didn't let him go that far. He then wondered where their relationship was heading.
After their breakup, Tony received a letter from Adrian requesting his blessing for a romantic relationship he had begun with Veronica. Tony wrote an 'approval' letter, replying that it was perfectly fine with him.
A few years later, Tony met up with his two best friends, Colin and Alex, from Sixth Form, who informed Tony that Adrian had committed suicide. They also reminded the forgetful Tony that Adrian and Veronica had an instant connection when Tony first introduced them and it was then that their affair started. Following Adrian's suicide, the three friends went their separate ways.
In present day, Tony reconnects with Colin (Peter Wight) and Alex (Hilton McRae). They help him in locating Veronica via email. Next morning, Veronica (Charlotte Rampling) calls Tony by phone and sets up a meeting. The meeting does not go well as it is apparent that Veronica is still angry at him. She explains that she has burned the diary and takes leave after handing Tony a letter. Tony tails after Veronica until she drives away in her car.
Tony then takes Susie to hospital as she feels the baby is coming. He then finds time at the hospital to read the letter left with him by Veronica, only to find that the letter was clearly written by Tony himself. He now remembers that after tearing off the first 'approval' letter intended for Adrian, he re-wrote a nasty hurtful letter cursing them both. Reading it, Tony is shocked and appalled at his younger self.
Margaret then comes to the hospital, and tells Tony that Susie's apparent labor is a false alarm. At home, Tony shows Margaret the nasty letter.
Tony stalks Veronica till he finds her whereabouts. He discovers the name of the man she was seen holding hands with to be Adrian, who has a mental problem. Jumping to the conclusion that Adrian Jnr (Andrew Buckley) must be the son of Veronica and the deceased Adrian, he arranges a meeting with her once again to make his apology. The meeting doesn't go well as Veronica storms out to a truly apologetic Tony.
When Tony later revisits the pub that young Adrian frequents, it is revealed by the caretaker of Adrian that young Adrian was, in fact, Sarah's son, that Victoria is actually young Adrian's half-sister.
A few days later, Tony drives her daughter Susie to hospital when she really goes into labor. She gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Tony makes a sincere apology to Margaret for having made her life miserable. Margaret forgives him and later sends him a new watch as a gift. Sometime later Tony writes to Veronica, apologizing to her for what he has done. The story ends with Susie's visit to Tony, bringing along the new-born baby."

While smoking marijuana, Lucky shows Loretta old photos of his military service in the US Navy and they watch old VHS tapes of Liberace performing in concert as Lucky comments on his past life how he never got married or settled down.While having coffee at the diner, Lucky runs into the lawyer Bobby Lawrence where he confides in him about his accident days earlier. Bobby tells Lucky about a time when he nearly got into a car accident that could have been fatal and comments on being prepared for the unexpected.Lucky visits a pet store to look for a small animal to adopt as a companion, but he instead decides on a packet of live crickets.At the diner the next morning, Lucky meets a tourist named Fred (Tom Skerritt) whom he chats up a conversation after learning that Fred used to be a Marines veteran who served in World War II. Lucky tells Fred about his time in the US Navy during the war in the Pacific and of his evading death several times during combat. He shares that his nickname arose from him having the relatively safe job of cook on an LST.Fred tells Lucky a moving story from his experiences during the war in the Pacific. After the Marines secured the beach, the locals began to commit suicide, jumping from cliffs. The Japanese had told them, Fred explains, that the Americans would kill and rape them. In the mayhem of battle, Fred recounts, he had encountered a young girl. Amidst all the carnage, she was smiling, with a smile that seemed to come from the core of her being. Fred wondered how she could smile in the midst of all that misery and death. One of Fred's fellow soldiers explains that the girl is a Buddhist; she thinks that they are about to kill her and she is smiling at the prospect. ""There are no medals for bravery like that,"" Fred remarks.Lucky attends Bibi's son Juan's birthday party and comes to enjoy the company and even sings a song in Spanish for the attendees.That evening, Lucky goes back to the bar for his Bloody Mary drinks as usual where he chats up talk with Howard, Paulie and others about his life. Howard still has not found his tortoise and claims that it was ""meant to be"" of his companion leaving and that all things must eventually come to an end. Lucky then lights up a cigarette at the bar, despite being told not to by the owner, Elaine, and brings up his public smoking that got him banned from a place called Eve's. Lucky explains that everything goes away eventually and we are left with Nothing. Elaine asks what you are supposed to do with Nothing. Lucky replies that you smile. The remark transforms the mood of the bar; Lucky lights up his cigarette and steps outside.The next morning, Lucky wakes up and goes into his usual routine with drinking his cup of hot black coffee, doing yoga, and drinking a glass of cold milk. He then sets the clock on his coffee machine to the correct time and cleans up his house for the first time in months. He goes for a walk through town as he always does and passes by an outdoor botanic garden which is named 'Eve's' where he was banned for public smoking. In the desert, Lucky lights up a cigarette, looks up at a tall and imposing cactus with smaller cacti growing from it, breaks the fourth wall by staring directly into the camera and smiling, and begins his walk back to town. In the final shot as Lucky walks down the desert trail path alone, a tortoise (presumably Howard's tortoise) walks across the path from one end to the other before disappearing in the desert bushes."

Of course, in this select and intimate soirée, apart from Bill, Janet's self-denying academic husband, the elegant hostess has also invited a motley crew of elite, hand-picked guests: There's April, the sourly cynical American best friend; her unlikely German husband, Gottfried; there's also Jinny and Martha; and finally, Tom, the smooth banker in the impeccable suit. But inevitably, before dinner is served, the upbeat ambience will shatter to pieces, as festering secrets start surfacing, turning the otherwise happy event into the perfect domestic war-zone. Undoubtedly, after this night, things will never be the same again.—Nick Riganas The first shot shows us a woman, stressed with her hair almost messy. In the nest seconds, she points a gun at us and we're not sure if she's gonna pull the trigger or not. Screen smashes to black and the film's title and opening credits are revealed.Janet, a politician for the opposition party, has just been announced shadow minister for health and is having a small celebratory party at her house. Invited are her friends April, with her estranged German partner Gottfried, a life coach and self-proclaimed spiritual healer, Women's studies professor Martha, with her partner Jinny, a renowned chef, and Janet's colleague and subordinate Marianne with husband Tom, a banker.Before the party begins and even after the guests arrive, Janet's husband Bill sits in his chair, listening to music, staring vacantly, and drinking wine. All invited guests come, with the exception of Marianne, who Tom says will arrive later due to extra work.Tom agrees Marianne will come ""For supper or for coffee"".Tom is extremely nervous and immediately locks himself in the bathroom, where he sniffs some cocaine, examines a gun he has brought with him and encourages himself in the mirror.While the party is running, Janet is exchanging secret phone calls and messages with an unknown lover.April tries to open a bottle of champagne which results in the cap running off the bottle and breaking a window. As Janet is cleaning up, one of the broken glasses marks her leg. She takes out the glass and the party still goes on.After April, who continually belittles and insults Gottfried, speaks a toast for Janet, Martha and Jinny announce that Jinny is pregnant with three boys. This is immediately followed by Bill announcing that he has just been informed by his doctor that he is terminally ill. Gottfried tells him that modern medicine is not to be believed and that by becoming spiritual, Bill may have a chance of surviving. Bill, who is by the way a well-known atheist intellectual, seems to waver in his commitment to his beliefs and begins to listen to Gottfried.The little cakes Janet was baking burn and Jinny, joined by Tom, decide to clean the smoke coming out of the kitchen. An euphoric Tom braks the fire alarm that startles him, and after Jinny takes out the now-burned little cakes out of the oven, she spots Tom's gun hanging with him, which concerns her.Jinny walks to the bathroom and vomits. Outside, Tom asks her what's wrong, and ""if what happened back there, had to do with me?"" (the concern of Jinny for the gun), which Jinny responds with a yes. After events, she exits the bathroom and talks to Martha about it.Janet says that she will resign from her shadow minister position and will take care of Bill, but he announces that he is ""leaving her for another woman"". That concerns Janet who doesn't stops asking who's that other woman. Bill finally answers that the other woman is actually Marianne, a fact that Tom had also learned earlier this day. Jinny and Martha go to the backyard.Janet is afraid of losing control over Bill, and after she slapped him twice, she regrets and starts losing her mind. As she's about to do it a third time, Bill, yelling, furious, begs and urges her to do it, which results of Janet incapable of doing it.Gottfried tries to help and coach Tom and Bill, but their discussions escalate when Bill gushes about the love that Marianne and he share. Tom berates Bill and argues furiously with him, which ends up in Tom viciously punching Bill in the face, leaving him unconcious while his eyes are wide open. Tom and Gottfried try to wake him up: Gottfried tries waking him up in the typical medical style while Tom starts music for him to wake up. Sadly, he doesn't wake up. Tom becomes more desperate; thinking he killed Bill, and Gottfried says ""there's nothing else to do"". Gottfried and Tom fear that Tom has killed Bill and they try to seek help from the others, with sadly unfortunate results. Minutes later, Tom goes into the backyard, where he throws his gun into the dustbin and walks back inside.On the backyard, Jinny and Martha have a serious talk about the future and motherhood. Martha tries to make things up with a heartbroken Jinny, who agrees that after the party that ""she doesn't want to see her again"" and she ""rathers doing all by herself"". Jinny concludes saying that when the babies are born, she doesn't want Martha to be there. This leads Martha to confess to Jinny that she fears what will happen and to plead Jinny to stay with her.Meanwhile, a stressed out Janet throws the burned little cakes to the dustbin, and after she closes it, she notices the gun Tom had thrown away and takes it with her, locking herself in the bathroom and hiding the gun there. After making a last call, she throws her phone and cried. She lets April in and they talk about what happened. April, who has been cynical the whole time, is asked to speak honestly by Janet and tells her that she is proud of her accomplishments. That speech calms Janet who gives April a hug. Both embrace.Realizing there's nothing else to do, Gottfried tells Martha to call Janet. Martha knocks the door of the bathroom and tells April, and not Janet, to come. Obviously, April and Janet exit the bathroom and run to the scene. Janet, somehow, manages to resuscitate Bill, who looks her in the eyes and asks ""how did it come to this?"" At that moment, the doorbell rings, with everybody expecting it to be Marianne. Janet rushes to the bathroom and as she grabs the gun, a scared Tom urges her not to kill her and that ""he's a good person"". Janet exits the bathroom, runs to open the door and aims the gun at the visitor, who is invisible to the audience, and exclaims ""You told me you loved me. ME! You traitor!"" before it cuts to black. We're not sure if she's gonna pull the trigger at Marianne (at us) or not.And the end credits roll.The Party."

Novitiate,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513316/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in the early 1960s and during the era of Vatican II, a young woman in training to become a nun struggles with issues of faith, the changing church and sexuality. 1964. Cathleen Harris, in her late teens, has resided at the Convent of the Beloved Rose in her home state in the American south for close to two years, first as a postulant for six months, before taking her first vows to become a novice. Unlike the other postulants and novices, Sister Cathleen was raised in a household without religion, let alone Catholicism. As such, her decision to become a nun, which went against her divorced mother's wishes, may be more secure in her mind than her colleagues for which this life course may be more bred within them. The convent is led by the Mother Abbess, Reverend Mother Marie Saint Clare, whose entire life is this convent off of where she not stepped foot in forty years. Reverend Mother believes she is the voice of God within the walls of the convent, and thus does not tolerate any of the sisters questioning her authority. She also believes that the Catholicism which she has known all her life is perfect. When she receives an edict regarding the Second Vatican Council - more commonly referred to as Vatican II - which, opened in 1962 as a process to make the Catholic church more open to modern ideals, she refuses to implement any of the changes, let alone discuss the edict with any of the sisters, especially with the likes of Sister Mary Grace, the Mistress of Postulants and Novices who has more contemporary views of the church. Sister Cathleen's drive to become a nun is set against this backdrop, her process which is not as easy as it appears to the others, and whether she makes it to nun is affected by the Reverend Mother's strict methods and refusal to modernize.—Huggo In 1954, seven-year-old Cathleen Harris lives in rural in Tennessee with her mother, Nora, a factory worker, who is non-religious but wants to show Cathleen a church and let her make her own decision. Cathleen's father, Chuck, comes home late, drunk, and argues with his wife. Chuck eventually leaves. Nora supports herself and picks up a series of men for one-night stands. At age 12, Cathleen seeks love of her own, and finds it in Catholicism when two nuns visit her home and offer her enrollment at a Catholic girls' school. The school offers her free tuition and a full scholarship to any college Cathleen chooses if her grades are excellent. At the school one day, a young nun befriends Cathleen and describes how she is married to Christ. At age 17 in the year 1964, after Cathleen comes home from school and runs into another one of her mother's pickups, Cathleen decides to leave home and give her life to God.. Raised by a vehemently non-religious, single mother (Nicholson) in rural Tennessee during the '50s, a scholarship to Catholic school soon finds Cathleen (Qualley) drawn into all the mystery and romanticism of a life devoted to the worship and servitude of God. With the dawn of the Vatican II era, radical changes in the Church are threatening the course of nuns' lives. Cathleen finds herself struggling with issues of faith, sexuality, and the changing administration. This is a story of the effect of Vatican II (1962-65) on the Catholic Church, as seen in one convent, through the eyes of the tough old-fashioned Mother Superior, the kinder, younger, and more modern nuns, and the Postulants and Novices, particularly Sister Cathleen.In 1954, seven-year-old Cathleen Harris (Eliza Manson) lives in rural in Tennessee with her mother, Nora (Julianne Nicholson), a factory worker, who is non-religious but wants to show Cathleen a church and let her make her own decision.

Nora supports herself and picks up a series of men for one-night stands.At age 12, Cathleen (Sasha Mason) seeks love of her own, and finds it in Catholicism when two nuns visit her home and offer her enrollment at a Catholic girls' school. The school offers her free tuition and a full scholarship to any college Cathleen chooses if her grades are excellent. At the school one day, a young nun befriends Cathleen and describes how she is married to Christ. At age 17 in the year 1964, after Cathleen (Margaret Qualley) comes home from school and runs into another one of her mother's pickups, Cathleen decides to leave home and give her life to God.With twenty other girls, Cathleen joins the Sisters of the Beloved Rose. She will be a postulate for six months in their convent, after which she will become a novice for a year and a half, and then make her final vows to become a nun. The Abbess, Reverend Mother Marie Saint-Clair (Melissa Leo), is tough, cold, traditional and largely responsible for training and disciplining the postulates. She leads the postulates through the weekly ""chapter of faults,"" in which they must publicly confess to all their faults and face the accusation of the other postulates, for which Mother Superior assigns extreme, humiliating penances, including ""The Discipline,"" a knotted whip that they use to flagellate themselves.Sister Mary Grace (Dianna Agron), a young, warm, kind, and progressive nun, is the Postulant Mistress, who tries to make life easier for them. Most of the day is heavily regimented, but sometimes the postulates fall into girlish activities and giggling. Cathleen tends to avoid interacting with the other girls and spends her free time alone and reading from the Bible.Mother Superior keeps getting envelopes from Archbishop McCarthy (Denis O'Hare) about Vatican II, which she ignores. Sister Mary Grace sees the documents, and says that change would be good. Mother Superior cuts her off with, ""The Church is perfect exactly the way it is."" Later, they argue, and Sister Mary Grace challenges Mother Superior's authority. Sister Mary Grace goes off to pray, and decides to leave the convent.After six months, Cathleen takes her Simple Vows and becomes a novice. As Reverend Mother grows increasingly harsh, 18-year-old Sister Cathleen undergoes a sexual awakening. Cathleen stirs one night after masturbating in her sleep. She stops eating and interacting with the other novices and nuns over her ""impure thoughts"". When her mother visits the convent to deliver news about her father Chuck's passing, she notices Cathleen's pale and emaciated appearance. Nora threatens the Reverend Mother over her daughter's treatment, but Reverend Mother bushes it off, saying that Nora no longer has a daughter but that Cathleen has now given her life to the Church.Cathleen eventually collapses during dinner one evening from starvation and dehydration, she is sent to the infirmary for several days where she confides in another young nun, Sister Emanuel (Rebecca Dayan). Later on, Cathleen sneaks out of the infirmary and into Sister Emanuel's room where Cathleen tells her that she longs for ""comfort,"" leading to a kiss and their having lesbian sexual intercourse. After this, Cathleen leaves the infirmary and shows signs of recovery, is eating again and showing quiet happiness, but neither she or Sister Emanuel ever discuss their sexual encounter.Meanwhile, Archbishop McCarthy pays a visit to the convent. He tells Mother Superior that ""this order in particular"" is having difficulty embracing the changes of Vatican II. She dismisses the ""ridiculous reforms."" He tells her that if she can't adapt to the changes, she will be replaced. As for ""that old medieval stuff,"" the extreme penances, ""That's gotta stop."" Mother Superior is devastated. She fears God has abandoned her.At a subsequent Chapter of Faults, a novice confesses that she questions God's existence. Mother Superior tells her she's tired of hearing of her spiritual wretchedness and assigns her no penance at all. When Cathleen goes next and confesses feeling the need to be emotionally comforted and about her one-time sexual encounter with another nun. Cathleen refuses to give away the nun's name and only asks for penance. Mother Superior forces Cathleen to crawl on her hands and knees and to beg for penance from each of the other novices, which finally brings Cathleen to tears. Mother Superior grants penance to Cathleen anyway. Afterwards, Sister Emanuel leaves the convent without saying goodbye to Cathleen.Eventually, Mother Superior calls the congregation and reads aloud the Archbishop's memo about Vatican II. Priests will say the Mass in English, and face the congregation. Catholics must embrace religious tolerance. Nuns are no longer required to wear habits and can wear whatever they wish as their status is now reduced and equal to any lay Catholic.Of the original twenty postulates, only five are left to profess their final vows to become solemnly professed nuns, among them is Cathleen. At their mass of Solemn Profession, the priest asks each of the novices, ""What do you seek?"" One answers that she wants to take her vows and marry Jesus Christ. The priest then asks Cathleen the same question. She answers, ""I seek something more."""

Loveless,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6304162/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A couple going through a divorce must team up to find their son who has disappeared during one of their bitter arguments. Still living under the same roof, the Moscow couple of Boris and Zhenya is in the terrible final stages of a bitter divorce. Under those circumstances, as both have already found new partners, the insults pour down like rain in this toxic familial battle zone, always pivoting around the irresolvable and urgent matter of Alyosha's custody, their 12-year-old only son. Unheard, unloved, and above all, unwanted, the introverted and unhappy boy feels that he is an intolerable burden, however, what his parents don't know is that he can hear every single word. As a result, when Boris and Zhenya finally realize that Alyosha has been missing for nearly two days, it is already too late. But is this a simple case of a runaway teenager?—Nick Riganas Whether or not it is designed as an allegory of modern Russia, no film in recent memory has examined the growing emptiness of human relationships with such expressive force as Andrei Zvyagintsev's (""Leviathan"") Loveless, a heart wrenching drama about a couple on the brink of divorce whose emotional neglect of their son leads to devastating consequences. Though the film has been characterized as ""bleak,"" the feeling tone is more like sadness and regret that many today have lost the capacity for compassion and empathy. Accompanied by Evgeny Galperin's rich cascading piano score, the film opens as cinematographer Mikhail Krichman surrounds us with the quiet beauty of a Russian winter.Almost immediately, we are staring at an cold-looking stone building that could easily be a prison in Siberia. There is no sound or movement. Suddenly a door opens and children, released from school, swarm through its exits. Though some are laughing, it is not a happy scene. 12-year-old Aloysha (Matvey Novikov) makes his way home through a barren forest but there are no warm greetings awaiting him. The marriage between his mother, beauty-salon owner Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and his father Boris (Alexey Rozin, ""Leviathan""), a desk-ridden management functionary, is over. Seeking status, money, and freedom, both are immersed in new relationships. Boris is with the pregnant Masha (Marina Vasilyeva, ""Name Me"") and Zhenya with the well-to-do business executive Anton (Andris Keishs, ""What Nobody Can See"").Though their apartment has been advertised for sale and their divorce is in its final stages, custody of Alyosha has not yet been agreed upon. It is clear that he is an unwanted child, the result of an unexpected pregnancy and a marriage of convenience. Like emotionless machines, the warring couple continue their repetitive spiral of mutual recrimination as Alyosha crouches behind the bathroom door. Fearful and alone he absorbs every last ounce of malice, his face becoming contorted into a mass of silent tears that well up from deep within his being. It is a shocking scene that mirrors every despair the world has ever known.Since the film takes place in the year 2012, talk radio focuses on the Mayan calendar and its apocalyptic date in December. News reports tell us about the bloody war in the Ukraine. Amidst the barely-controlled paranoia in the air, Boris tells a co-worker that he is afraid to lose his job if his boss, a fundamentalist Christian, finds out about his impending divorce. Fear of losing his job becomes secondary, however, when Zhenya tells him that Alyosha has not shown up for school for two days and is now missing. Far from coming together to patch up their differences, however, the estranged couple only double-down on their mutual acrimony.The inefficient police offer little expectation that they can find the boy and try to reassure the parents that, in most cases, a missing child is with a friend or relative or out on an adventure and will soon return home. Not satisfied with officialdom's inertia, they turn to a volunteer group who put up posters, talk to teachers and neighbors. An interview with Alyosha's only friend points them to an abandoned apartment in the middle of a forest. In a scene of eerie darkness where there is a palpable feeling of hopelessness and loss, the rescuers, wearing bright orange jackets, comb every space in the decrepit building but Alyosha is not found.A boy matching Alyosha's description is found at a nearby hospital but it is not him, and a subsequent visit to the morgue only offers more tears. Taking a risk, the two visit Alyosha's mother but the visit only succeeds in bringing hatred up to a level of ecstasy. With no explanation in sight, Zvyagintsev teases us with the sight of an unknown man walking alone into the forest, a man hidden from the camera in a fancy restaurant asking a call girl for her phone number which she provides while looking directly into the camera, a man pausing at a bus stop to read the flier about the missing boy, then turning and walking away, and a teacher cleaning her blackboard after students have left.These tantalizing scenes, however, do not bring us any closer to a solution to the mystery of Alyosha's disappearance. Loveless is a deeply disturbing film that explores the dark places of human behavior, upending our most cherished beliefs about the bond between parents and children. Making it clear about what can happen when an unwanted child is brought into the world, Anton tells Zhenya that no one can survive a life without love. If Loveless serves as any kind of warning, it may be to help us discover that the world cannot survive either unless we begin to re-envision it as sacred.Movie ends with the boy not being found."

Anna tries to be helpful, but Steph drives her away when she accidentally tells her ""At least you don't have a mother that nags you"", since Steph was essentially dropped off in Little Haven while her parents are vacationing in Mexico, which she believes to be because they can't handle that she is a lesbian. As Anna walks away, she brushes up against a zombie.The school holds the show that night while Anna and Chris work at the bowling alley. Lisa sings a highly suggestive song that shocks the other parents (""It's That Time of Year""). She is disappointed to find that Chris did not make it, but his grandmother did. Savage watches the display from his booth with Tony, who is the school's janitor. Savage attempts to rush to the stage to stop the song, but Lisa manages to finish. Outside, a zombie is attempting to break into the school. Savage warns them to go away, or else. When the zombie keeps banging, Savage opens the doors but finds nobody outside.In the morning, Anna decides to put on a positive attitude and embrace the day... all while the zombie apocalypse is happening around her, and she fails to notice the chaos since she is singing (""Turning My Life Around""). John joins in the song as the two meet at the cemetery. They make their way to a playground when they are spotted by a zombie dressed as a snowman. When they realize what is going on, Anna lures the zombie near her as she waits by a seesaw, and then uses it to whack the zombie's head off and causing John to scream like a girl.Anna and John decide to head to the bowling alley for safety. They find Chris and Steph there, but Anna and Chris's boss has become a zombie. They kill her just moments before a whole horde of zombies starts to break in. Using bowling balls, pins, and a spatula, among other things, the friends kill off the zombies one by one. They then attempt to reach their loved ones, but find that they have no reception. Meanwhile, Tony, Lisa, Chris's gran, and other adults are stuck at the school. Lisa tends to Chris's gran since she has a bad heart. Savage, however, wants everyone to listen to him, but nobody will since he's such a prick. Anna and her friends stay at the bowling alley as it gets dark and watch as the army firebombs the town while they wish in song they had their loved ones close (""Human Voice"").The following day, the friends see that even the army soldiers have turned into zombies. They use the inflatable pool in the place as a means to get outside without being spotted by zombies. Unfortunately, they ARE spotted, and they have to crouch down. Even more unfortunate, one of the zombies starts peeing on top of Steph. The friends are then saved by Nick and his buddies as they have been killing zombies left and right, which he takes the time to brag about in song (""Soldier At War""). After slaying a few more zombies, both groups hide inside a Christmas tree shop. They find more zombies in there, and they feast on Nick's friends, forcing him to join Anna and her friends.Back at the school, Savage has nobody on his side. As the zombies are now close to breaking in, he declares that the school is his, and he opens the doors.John pushes Anna in a cart when he drops a hint about potentially getting with Anna since she obviously doesn't want to be with Nick. However, Anna makes it firmly clear that she views John as her best friend, leaving him visibly disappointed. They join their friends as they run through a store to fight off more zombies. Just when it looks like they're in the clear, a zombie comes up from behind and bites John's hand. As more zombies approach, and knowing he is already doomed, John carries Anna through the group of zombies to get her to safety while he resigns to his fate and is taken by the zombies. Anna tearfully tries to save John, but Nick pulls her away.The friends make it to the school and find most of the adults are now zombies. Savage hides behind a counter as he draws the zombies' attention toward the kids, now having lost his mind as he plans to maintain total control (""Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now""). The friends fight their way through the zombies while also trying to hide. Steph joins Chris as he finds Lisa hiding in a closet. Sadly, Chris's gran passed away since her heart gave out, but he is just thankful she didn't become a zombie. The three then go look for Savage's office to get Steph's car keys. She manages to get to the office after crawling there, and she ends up recovering her keys. When she tries to get back to Chris and Lisa, the zombies spot them and attack. Steph makes it to safety, but Chris and Lisa both get bitten. They hold each other lovingly as they spend their final moments together. Steph tearfully watches them and escapes.Anna and Nick go to look for Tony. They talk about why they broke up, and Anna says it's because Nick acted like her feelings meant nothing and that he just doesn't care. Nick then reveals that he had to kill his father because he turned into a zombie, and his father had requested that he do it and not disappoint him for once. The zombies then break in and attack. Nick stays behind to fight them while Anna goes to find her father.Anna finds Tony in the auditorium, but he's been tied up in Christmas lights by Savage, who tries to bring more zombies to get Anna. Anna grabs a pointed candy cane and gears up for the ultimate showdown (""Give Them A Show""). She takes down a few zombies before heading to the stage to save her father. Savage attempts to create more trouble, but Tony punches him in the face. Savage then tries to sneak up on Tony, but Anna drops the star prop on Savage, knocking him into the zombie crowd where is is gruesomely devoured. Anna tries to take Tony away, but he reveals he was bitten in the leg. Anna breaks down, but Tony holds her as they spend one last moment together (""I Will Believe""). He tells her to go on with Nick (even though he doesn't like him) to be safe while he waits for the inevitable.Anna and Nick leave the school as a bunch of zombies start to close in on them. They are saved in the nick of time by Steph in her car. As they drive away, we see that John, Chris, and Lisa are now all zombies, while Tony stares at a photo of Anna before succumbing to the same fate. The three survivors of Anna, Nick, and Steph then drive out of town, unsure of where to go now that the world is apparently doomed. As they make their way out, a zombie Santa appears and growls at the viewers."

Final Portrait,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4494718/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Swiss painter and sculptor Alberto Giacometti. In 1964, while on a short trip to Paris, the American writer and art-lover James Lord (Armie Hammer) is asked by his friend, the world-renowned artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush), to sit for a portrait. The process, Giacometti assures Lord, will take only a few days. Flattered and intrigued, Lord agrees. So begins not only the story of an offbeat friendship, but, seen through the eyes of Lord, an insight into the beauty, frustration, profundity and, at times, downright chaos of the artistic process. FINAL PORTRAIT is a portrait of a genius, and of a friendship between two men who are utterly different, yet increasingly bonded through a single, ever-evolving act of creativity. It is a film which shines a light on the artistic process itself, by turns exhilarating, exasperating and bewildering, questioning whether the gift of a great artist is a blessing or a curse."
Phillauri,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5502766/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man must marry a tree to ward off threats to his love-life, but the tree turns out to have more spirit than the man bargained for. A young Mangalik boy is supposed to marry a tree if he wants to marry a girl of his choice while the tree which he gets married has Shashi a ghost residing on it waiting for her lover.Shashi starts to follow him everywhere after he marries the tree.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com Kanan is preparing to marry his girlfriend Anu, but learns that he is a ""Mangalik"" born under an unlucky star and his marriage could be cursed. He is skeptical of what he sees as a baseless superstition, but reluctantly agrees to marry a tree to break the curse. At the completion of the ceremony, the tree is chopped down; freeing Kanan to marry Anu. However, the ghost of Shashi had been residing in that tree and she follows the groom home. Now wed to a ghostly-bride that only he can see, Kanan must find a way to set her spirit free.—L. Hamre A young man Kanan (Suraj Sharma) returns to India from Canada to marry his long-term girlfriend Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), but comes to know that as he is a Manglik (born under an unlucky star) he has to get married to a tree before getting married to her. He very reluctantly marries the tree, which is duly chopped down after the completion of the ceremony. As a result, from that day on-wards he is haunted by the spirit of a woman named Shashi (Anushka Sharma), who lived in that particular tree and hence claims to now be 'married' to him.The story of Phillauri and Shashi is slowly revealed via the latter's flashbacks. Back in an unspecified time period, Shashi is a bright young woman who never fails to read the works of a poet named Phillauri that is regularly published in a local daily. Everyone in the village of Phillaur knows that the poems are written by the singer Roop Lal 'Phillauri' (Diljit Dosanjh), who is the heart-throb of the village. However Roop Lal notices that Shashi, unlike all the other village girls, never comes to hear him sing. When he confronts her one day and tells her that he is the Phillauri who writes the poetry by narrating one of his famous poems to her, he is shocked when Shashi slaps and insults him. She asks him to use his talent - of being able to connect with the common man through his songs - for something important (especially when the struggle for independence is on) and not for frivolous matters. From that day on-wards Roop Lal is a changed man, dedicating his life to knowing and understanding the poetry of Phillauri (which it is clear now that he is not the author of), and spreading its message via his beautiful singing to others.On one particular night while Roop Lal is alone at home singing one of Phillauri's poems, Shashi comes to him and reveals that she is the one who writes poetry under the pseudonym of 'Phillauri' (which she can't do openly, being a woman). Subsequently love blossoms between the two (the poet and the singer who translates her poetry to song and spreads its message far and wide), but Shashi's elder brother (a reputed doctor of the village who brought her up) eventually comes to know about the affair and intervenes between the lovers. Roop Lal confronts Shashi's brother and admits to having been an alcohol-addicted good-for-nothing who still is not worthy of her, but tells him that he (Roop Lal) is going to Amritsar to record all the songs written by Shashi and will eventually return and ask for her hand in marriage.
The very fact that Shashi writes poetry is a revelation to her brother, and as time passes he too reads the poems and starts appreciating her obvious talent. Meanwhile Roop Lal records the songs in Amritsar (the gramophone record is credited to Roop Lal 'Phillauri', thus being an amalgam of his name and her pseudonym) and is paid a handsome fee of three hundred rupees. He immediately sends the entire amount as a money order to Shashi's brother, along with a letter stating his intention to return and marry her on Baisakhi. Shashi's brother, by now convinced of Roop Lal's changed nature and good intentions as well as the deep love between the couple, starts the preparations for her marriage.On the day of the wedding Shashi comes to know that she is pregnant, but does not disclose the news to anyone except her close friend Amrit (Nidhi Bisht). She expectantly waits for Roop Lal along with all her relatives and the entire village, but eventually the day ends with him nowhere to be seen on any of the buses from Amritsar. Her brother has to face the intense embarrassment and shame of sending everyone away, and this in turn hurts Shashi so much that she commits suicide (by hanging herself from a tree) due to an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair and betrayal.
In the midst of all these flashbacks by Shashi's spirit the parallel story-line in the present continues with Kanan (whose confused ramblings about seeing a ghost naturally no-one believes), ending up in trouble with Anu who feels that he is not really interested in marrying her (which is partially true since he is getting cold feet). In order to clear the misunderstanding Shashi finally manages to reveal her presence to Anu as well (though Anu still cannot see her), and having heard her entire painful story Anu realizes that Shashi's spirit is in fact still stuck on the mortal plane due to her unfulfilled love. At that point Anu's grandmother happens to play her favorite record, which as fate would have it is the one Roop Lal recorded. The record label mentions the recording date as 13 April 1919, which results in an epiphany for Kanan who immediately takes Anu (with Shashi in tow) to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on that very day 98 years ago.The movie ends with Shashi's spirit reuniting finally with her lover Roop Lal's (who was indeed killed in the massacre on the very Baisakhi day he recorded their songs and was to return to marry her). Before they both ascend to heaven Shashi tells Kanan and Anu (who can now see her) to love and cherish each other always, and that is what they promise each other as they embark on a new phase of their very own love story."

Young farmer Johnny Saxby numbs his daily frustrations with binge drinking and casual sex, until the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker for lambing season ignites an intense relationship that sets Johnny on a new path. Spring. Yorkshire. Isolated young sheep farmer Johnny Saxby numbs his daily frustrations with binge drinking and casual sex, until the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker Gheorghe, employed for the lambing season, ignites an intense relationship that sets Johnny on a new path. Johnny Saxby has turned into a sullen young man in needing to take on the proverbial and literal heavy lifting at the family's sheep and cattle farm in Northern England following his father Martin Saxby's stroke, which has rendered him physically disabled, and he requiring a cane to walk still with difficulty. Johnny has taken on this role without much passion and thus without placing much effort into it, especially as Martin is still looking over his shoulder at every turn. Johnny relieves his boredom by drinking to excess at the pub - he getting to the point of needing to vomit every time - and, gay, having casual, indiscriminate and passionless sex with whichever bloke he meets. During the busy birthing season, Martin hires Gheorghe Ionescu, a Romanian migrant farm worker, for a one week period. There is an immediate animosity between Johnny and Gheorghe largely over dealing with the stereotype Johnny has of all Romanians being shifty Romanis aka gypsies. In reality, Gheorghe, who grew up on such a farm back home, knows his farming well and places much care in it unlike Johnny. While Johnny and Gheorghe are away on a several day trip to work on a remote part of the farm, their animosity leads to some physicality between them which further leads to some sexual tension and ultimately a sexual relationship. In their solitude, their relationship turns more intimate, something that has never happened before for Johnny. Gheorghe, who is more experienced in true matters of the heart than Johnny, knows the current status of their relationship is unsustainable, something that Johnny may never get a point to in never having been there. Their relationship however does give Johnny a better understanding of how to live in his path on the farm with his parents especially in the circumstance of Martin's poor and deteriorating health.—Huggo Since his father Martin's disabling stroke, adolescent Johnny Saxby needs to grow up fast and step up to save the Yorkshire family's sheep and cattle farm, but it's not his choice and grumpy ingrate parental meddling doesn't help to motivate, so he drowns his sorrows in too much ale frequently, often vomiting afterwards, limiting his further social life to meaningless gay one-offs. For the back-breaking lambing season, Martin hires for a week Gheorghe Ionescu, an actually experienced Romanian migrant farm worker, with more professional dedication. Despite ignorantly calling the 'intruder' a gypsy, Johnny learns from him, and after jumping each-other's bones in the mud on the meadows, they start his first-ever more intimate relationship, yet it has no future, but provides some mentoring Johhny can use on all fronts.—KGF Vissers"

Sweet Country is set in 1929 in the outback of the Northern Territory. It is the story of a young boy called Philomac, who witnesses Sam, an Aboriginal stockman kill station owner Harry Marsh in self defense. Sam and his pregnant wife Lizzie go on the run and a posse pursues them across the outback. It's 1929 on the vast, desert-like, Eastern Arrernte Nation lands that are now known as the Central Australian outback. Sam Kelly, a middle-aged Aboriginal man, works the land of a kind white preacher, Fred Smith. After an ill-tempered bully (Leslie) arrives in town and Kelly kills him in self-defence, he and his wife go on the run as a posse gathers to hunt him down. The vast and arid Australian Northern Territory, 1929. Violent WWI veteran Harry March sets foot on the farm of compassionate preacher Fred Smith, bearing gifts in exchange for help to repair his old trap yard. However, as the kindly landowner reluctantly spares grizzled Aboriginal Sam Kelly, his only farmhand, to lend Harry a helping hand, unspeakable events reveal humankind's grotesque side and blood is spilled. Now, an angry posse led by battle-hardened Sergeant Fletcher is hot on the trail of an innocent, bent on seeing justice done. And as virulent prejudice and sheer hatred take over, tempers flare, banishing reason. Can the wanted man get a fair trial?—Nick Riganas In 1929, Australia, rancher and former soldier struggling with PTSD, Harry March rides to the front porch of Preacher Fred Smith to ask him for some help in building a track yard for his cattle. Fred insists that he will be too busy to help the reason being his trip to town. However, when Harry, who is an outright atheist encourages him that helping him ""would be the Christian thing to do,"" Fred asks his aborigine partner, Sam, whose family is living with him if he would be open to helping Harry. Sam immediately agrees.
Upon arriving at Harry's home bringing his wife and niece along, Sam notices that Harry is struggling with a drinking problem and becomes increasingly hostile towards Sam. That night Harry gets drunk and behaves menacingly towards Sam's family. The next day while Sam is helping Harry with his fence, Harry asks him about who he believes is his daughter to which Sam explains that she is his niece, Lucy. Harry sets Sam busy to work and rides back to the cabin where Sam's wife and niece are staying. When the niece is away, Harry brutally rapes Sam's wife Lizzie and orders her to not tell anyone, saying that he will kill both her and Sam and take the niece for his own. Sam and his family return to Fred's home shortly before he leaves for town, asking him to take Lucy with him to town in case Harry makes a return.
Harry then meets and quickly befriends a neighboring rancher, Mick Kennedy to ask him for some help from his aborigine farmhands in his ranch. When Mick hears that Sam was working with Harry, he relays that Sam had once worked for him until Mick maltreated him, prompting Sam to beat him to the ground before being run off his property. Harry immediately grows distrustful Philomac, Mick's youngest aborigine farmhand who has a reputation for stealing things. When he sees Philomac rifling through his saddlebags, Harry assumes that Philomac is trying to find and steal his gold watch and chains him to a boulder in the hot sun in punishment. However, Philomac escapes and runs off to the nearest ranch which just so happens to be Fred's ranch where Sam and Lizzie are staying.
Harry chases after Philomac and accuses Sam of ""harboring a prisoner"" believing Philomac to be in the house. Sam, not knowing that Philomac is hiding in the nearby barn, insists that there is no one there and even inadvertently calls Harry by his first name, which spark's Harry's ire. Harry breaks the window of the house and begins firing into the home, nearly hitting Sam and Lizzie. Sam arms himself with a shotgun and when Harry attacks again, shoots him in the throat. Harry dies painfully in the dirt and Sam and Lizzie run off. Philomac comes out of hiding and robs the body of the gold watch, before running off.
Mick soon learns that Sam has killed Harry and sets off to town where he tells what has happened to the brash and racist Sergeant Fletcher. Upon being told by his deputy that Harry was a veteran, like Fletcher himself, and that Sam is black, Fletcher arranges a posse consisting of Mick, Archie (Mick's right hand man), his deputy, and Fred, who volunteers only to make sure that Sam is not killed on the spot when found. Sam and Lizzie travel across the outback, staying together, but faltering when Lizzie begins questioning his leadership and his methods. The posse makes camp and Fred questions Fletcher's methods when Fletcher acts harshly towards Archie who is guiding them through the outback. Fletcher encourages for there to be a campfire song as way to change the subject. Fred begins singing ""Jesus Loves Me"" in an effort to get others to join in but Fletcher only looks ahead in disgust. Back at Mick's ranch, Philomac begins to regret his previous actions and hopes for Sam and Lizzie to escape, realizing how he has become like Mick Kennedy in being selfish and stealing.
Sam and Lizzie are in fact far ahead of the posse with a high chance of escape. However, Sam begins to realize that there is something wrong with Lizzie as she begins vomiting out the breakfast they have just have. Nevertheless, they push on, with the posse coming across their abandoned camping grounds. Sam and Lizzie safely cross into Tribal land where hostile native aborigines live. While Sam and Lizzie navigate over the tribal camp via the cliffs, Fletcher, his deputy, and Fred ride headlong into the camp where a brief standoff ensues. The deputy foolishly opens fire on them but is soon struck in the head with a spear and falls from his horse. He is killed by the natives as the rest of the posse rides off. Fletcher takes his anger out on Archie only for Mick to intervene. Fletcher insists angrily that they move on while the others conclude that they must turn back. When Fred relays the futility of Fletcher's actions, Fletcher strikes him to the ground. Fred then leaves the posse telling Fletcher, ""You're not right in the head.""
That night, Sam deducts that Lizzie is pregnant with Harry's child from the previous rape, and begins questioning whether they should continue running. He then finds a scorpion, which he hides in Fletcher's boot as a warning. However, Fletcher is unmoved and insists the hunt should continue. The posse reaches a salt desert in which both Mick and Archie decide to return home while an adamant Fletcher continues the hunt. However, he does not make it far. Dying of thirst and heatstroke, Fletcher collapses to the ground near death's door. Sam arrives, much to Fletcher's disbelief, and spares him by giving home a near-empty skin of water. Sam leaves after stripping Fkletcher of his weapons. Seeing the posse return home, Philomac is relieved to find that Sam and Lizzie escaped, and that Mick has begun to grow a professional respect towards Philomac. Tensions arise between Sam and Lizzie as Lizzie is angry that Sam did not kill Fletcher when he had the chance. It is revealed then that Fletcher had turned back and submerges his dried body in a water spring nearby. Sam had loaded Fletcher's own rifle and had prepared to shoot him during Fletcher's rest but decided not to, as Sam believed himself to be no murderer.
Archie confronts Philomac about Mick's interest in him and reminds him that he is not like Mick but instead, ""A Black fella like me."" Lizzie is almost accosted by tribal aborigines while fetching water but Sam arrives and rescues her, killing the attacker, but letting the fleeing one escape as he was unarmed. Fletcher returns home, empty-handed and depressed over his failure. He is greeted by his Saloon girlfriend and his adopted daughter, but even their attempts to relieve him fall short. Fletcher takes out his anger on the town while they are watching a projected movie of the exploits of the ""Kelly Gang."" Fletcher tries to imagine a new life for himself with his girlfriend, but is unable to cope with losing a battle.
The next morning he walks to his office to discover both Sam and Lizzie have returned having turned themselves into his law and authority. Despite surprise at first, Fletcher once again relapse to his hostility and locks Sam in solitary confinement before beating him and bragging to him that he will hang, blaming him for the death of his deputy. A scaffolding of gallows is erected nearby for Sam to hang from. In the saloon the next day, Fletcher becomes more and more possessive of his girlfriend, much to her disgust. He then runs in with the judge who has arrived to judge Sam, and is skeptical as he sees how young the judge is. While eating pickled eggs, Fletcher proudly tells the judge that there is no courthouse or church in the town, to which the judge is disgusted with. That night, Fletcher goes to Sam's cell and proudly announces that there is no way for Sam to survive saying, ""I am the law.""
The next morning at the trial, Archie is called up as a witness, and though inexperienced, gives a good explanation as to how Harry was behaving towards Philomac and Sam. Lizzie is called up as a witness but is unresponsive to his questions regarding the treatment she endured with Harry March due to the still raw trauma she is grappling with from his rape. The trial continues, and the entire town except for the judge and Fred, cry out for his hanging. The trial continues and Sam is called up for his confession. He confesses that he has deduced that Lizzie had become pregnant after Harry assaulted her and confesses that he killed Harry in self-defense. Sam also confesses that he himself is barren and cannot have children, to which Fletcher begins to sympathize with him, implied to also suffer from the same position. Before the final verdict is set, Philomac steals some food from the saloon and begins eating, but then shares it with Lucy. Fred arrives at Sam's cell to pray for him alongside Lizzie and Lucy. Mick is convinced that there is no escape for Sam and berates Fred for standing up for Sam.
The final verdict is passed and the judge explains that Sam is innocent, as the kill shot he dealt Harry March was done in self-defense. Mick is enraged at this and also put out when he sees Philomac with Archie. He becomes possessive of Philomac and explains to Archie that they will be leaving the vicinity as soon as the trial is over. Sam is relieved to find that he has been found innocent. The town roars in rage to this but Fletcher steps in and stands up for Sam.
Fred and Sam along with Sam's family leave the town in a wagon escorted by Fletcher. Mick buys a shotgun and realizes that Philomac is starting to speak like him. Fletcher escorts them out of the town down a country road saying that it is clear from then on out. In the wagon, Sam smiles for the first time throughout the entire film and thanks Fred, calling him ""boss."" Fred insists that Sam call him ""Friend"" instead. Sam happily calls him a friend. Just then, a gunshot rings out and Sam is shot in the chest. He falls back into the wagon and dies peacefully in Fred's arms. The traumatized Lizzie and Lucy watch in horror as he dies. Lizzie weeps and Lucy sits nearby, covered in his blood from the blast looking blindly ahead. Horrified and enraged, Sam calls out in anger and storms away through the beautiful countryside praying aloud, ""What chance have they got? What chance does this country got?""
Elsewhere, Philomac sits nearby a river, seeing now that Harry March's watch has stopped working. Seeing how much he has become like Mick and feeling responsible for Sam's death he drops the watch into the river, letting the last of Harry March's remnants sink with it.
Inspired by Sam's death, Fred begins work in building a church in the vicinity."

Byeong-soo (Sol Kyung-gu) was a serial killer. He has secret memoir recounting his killings, stating he killed them because ""they deserved to die for their own atrocities."" His first victim was his father, who was abusing the rest of his family. He explains that he buried his victims in some bamboo woods. His last victim was an unknown woman, and as he was driving away, he got in a car accident and injured his head, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. He stopped killing after the accident.Byeong-soo, now a veterinarian, lives with his teenage daughter Eun-hee (Kim Seol-hyun), who cares for him and records his activities in a tape recorder for him to remember them. The former serial killer goes to poetry class, where everyone praises his poems on the murders. However, when he threatens to kill them, they don't take him seriously. A woman, Jo Yeon-joo (Hwang Seok-jeong), from the class develops a crush on him, irritating him. He does his best to drive her away, but like the rest of the poetry group, she always thinks his threats are jokes from his poems. Byeong-soo is also unlikely friends with a policeman Byeong-man (Oh Dal-su).There is a new series of killings and the doctor wonders if he has started killing again. The doctor has a rear ender accident with someone and there is unexplained blood at the scene. He sneaks some of it away as the other driver gets out. The driver says he hit a deer but Byeong-soo thinks he has found the psychopath killer. He follows the man and discovers a woman's body, and reports it to the police. Byeong-soo also gives the police a sample of blood. Despite his own findings that the blood was human blood, the police state that it was deer blood.The man is revealed to be a local police man Tae-joo (Kim Nam-gil), who starts dating Eun-hee, meeting her while searching for Byeong-soo. He forbids her from seeing the young cop. To protect Eun-hee, he fights to keep his memory and he plans to kill Tae-joo. However it becomes apparent that his memories may not be as reliable as he expects them to be after attacking Eun-hee, mistaking her for the woman who was his last victim.Byeong-soo's fears are apparently confirmed when he finds himself restrained to a wall, with Tae-joo hacking into his memoir. Byeong-soo attempts to reach his tape recorder to record Tae-joo's conversation, but apparently fails, barely managing to grab it and drops it. Tae-joo reveals he swapped the blood sample with deer blood, and threatens to kill Eun-hee unless Byeong-soo takes the blame for Tae-joo's crimes. Byeong-soo then wakes up, with no memory of what happened, and the entire incident is assumed to be a dream.Byeong-soo orders Eun-hee to go with his sister (Gil Hae-yeon) in a taxi and sends them off. Byeong-soo follows Tae-joo at night, and finds footage of Yeon-joo being held hostage. When he presents this evidence to the police, they suspect Byeong-soo himself is responsible. He later learns his memories have also made him delusional, as his sister had committed suicide after he killed their father. This proves he didn't send Eun-hee away with her aunt, and comes to think his daughter was killed by him instead. Byeong-soo gives up with his suspicions, and thinks he was actually responsible for Tae-joo's murders, especially when he remembers his annoyance and threats toward Yeon-jo. The police discover the bodies buried by Byeong-soo in the woods.Byeong-soo remembers who his last victim was: his wife, whom he killed after discovering she was having an affair with another man. At this moment Byeong-soo learns that Eun-hee is not his biological daughter. After injuring his head in the car accident, he arrives home in a rage. Byeong-soo prepares to strangle a toddler Eun-hee, but his head injury causes his memory loss to kick in for the first time. When the pain goes away, he doesn't remember his wife's affair, instead comforting a frightened Eun-hee.Back in the present and filled with guilt, Byeong-soo prepares to kill himself as he listens to the remaining recordings of Eun-hee on his tape recorder. However, he stops when another recording of Tae-joo confessing his crimes plays. Byeong-soo actually recorded Tae-joo's confession and threats to his daughter when he reached for the device. Byeong-soo realizes that he sent Eun-hee into a taxi with Tae-joo as the driver.As Byeong-man prepares a search for Byeong-soo, he receives a call from the latter. Byeong-soo says that Tae-joo has his daughter, and plays the recording of Tae-joo's threats to the policeman, convincing him of the truth. The two work together to find Tae-joo, and Byeong-man follows him to a cabin in the woods. Byeong-man hides in the cabin and sees that Tae-joo has kidnapped Eun-hee, but Tae-joo kills the policeman as he prepares to apprehend him. As Byeong-soo arrives to the location, he records that he must save Eun-hee, and replaces her picture with Tae-joo's in a locket she gave to him to remember that he is a killer.As Tae-joo is outside, Byeong-soo hides Eun-hee and Tae-joo attacks him. With his head injured again, Byeong-soo goes into a near-vegetative state, and he unwittingly leads Tae-joo to Eun-hee's hiding spot. As Tae-joo approaches Eun-hee, he reveals the truth of her father being a serial killer, and that he has to pay the price for his sins. Byeong-soo's memory restores and he manages to fight back before Tae-joo can kill her. Tae-joo appears to gain the upper hand, but Byeong-soo chokes him at the last minute and rolls on top of him, using the same technique he did to kill his previous victims. Tae-joo stabs him with a broken vase, but Byeong-soo persists. Finally resigning to his fate, the choking Tae-joo says that he himself will have to be punished. Byeong-soo takes the broken vase and stabs him to death. Eun-hee is now horrified by Byeong-soo, now knowing the truth about her father. However, he tells her that she is not the daughter of a murderer because of his wife's affair. Byeong-soo is later arrested. Eun-hee listens to Byeong-soo's latest recording about the need to find her and that she is the only reason why he is still alive. When she visits Byeong-soo, his Alzheimer's disease is at its worst, and he thinks he is a kid and Eun-hee is his dead sister.In the final scene, Byeong-soo is released from prison, walking on a desolate railroad. When he looks at Tae-joo's picture which is still on his daughter's locket, his perceptions take a turn for the worst: his Alzheimer's disease kicks in again, and he records, ""Never trust your memory. Tae-joo is still alive,"" because many of his memories were unreliable before, he is suspicious of the memory of killing Tae-joo.Alternate Version:
In the final scene, Byeong-soo is released from prison, walking on a desolate railroad. He switches his shoe, which he was wearing on the wrong foot. It's shown that he is the one who committed the Maiden Murders. Also he killed his police friend, who was planning to arrest him with the help of Eun-hee and Tae-joo. Then he sedates Eun-hee and kills Tae-joo and dumps his body along with the Silver Sonata in the reservoir. The movie fades out with Byeong-soo saying ""Never trust your memory""."

A bitter struggle for survival against betrayal set in pre-World War II Manila. This story set before World War II in Intramuros tells of the plight of sisters Candida and Paula Marasigan, daughters of high-profile painter Don Lorenzo Marasigan.Since Don Lorenzo has not produced a single painting for a long time, the family is in financial trouble. The unmarried sisters have had to rely on their seemingly more successful brother Manolo and sister Pepang. Their siblings urge Candida and Paula to sell the house.
To have a source of income, the sisters take in a boarder, Tony Javier. Meanwhile, Don Lorenzo becomes a recluse. The painter's self-portrait fetches a high sum as it attracts the curiosity of many individuals which include pretentious art critics, bona fide journalist and family friend Bitoy Camacho, Senator Perico who asks the sisters to donate the portrait to the government and Tony who tries to convince Candida and Paula to sell it to an American.An ode to the passing of the world of truth and beauty and a celebration of the tenacity of the spirit amid the rise of materialism and consumerism.Ang Larawan is the film adaptation of Larawan, The Musical which is based on National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin's three-act English play A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino.

Shock and Awe,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5540992/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of journalists of the Knight-Ridder news service covering President George W. Bush's planned invasion of Iraq in 2003 are skeptical of the President's claim that Saddam Hussein has ""weapons of mass destruction."" On 9/11 2001, the World Trade Center is destroyed by the Al Qaeda terrorist organization. In the resulting tumult, the reporters of the Knight-Ridder news service, Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel under the editorship of John Walcott, hear odd reports that President Bush's senior administration is not so much concerned with finding the Al Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, as they are in blaming the secular dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. Despite their intelligence sources saying that Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11, the K-R reporters discover that the White House is obsessed with finding any excuse to attack Iraq with cherry-picking intelligence reports and blatant lies by its officials. As the journalists dig deeper, their competitors uncritically repeat the Bush Administration's falsehoods that too much of the public is gullible enough to believe, making their quest to find and print the truth proves as a frustrating struggle as events barrel to a needless war.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol1970@gmail.com) With the western world, in the immediate aftermath, trying to discover the perpetrators to take the appropriate actions for some sort of justice, the general belief by those who work in such issues is that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda led byOsama bin Laden. In addition, theGeorge W. Bushadministration, the primary faces being Bush himself and Secretary of DefenseDonald Rumsfeld, floats the notion in their press briefings that it was also state sponsored terrorism, the most likely state being Iraq led bySaddam Hussein. JournalistsJonathan LandayandWarren Strobel, working for Knight Ridder, a consortium of thirty-one newspapers across the US, under the Washington Bureau ChiefJohn Walcott, know that inherently the Iraq story does not make any sense, and investigate, speaking to any on-the-record or off-the-record sources, especially within the Pentagon if they can. As the Bush administration further begins to state that Hussein, as an extension to 9/11, is trying to obtain nuclear weapons, which most know is true but that he is highly unlikely ever to achieve, but already has in his arsenal what are coined WMDs - weapons of mass destruction - most credible and respected mainstream media report the issue behind such statements as fact, while Landay, Strobel and Walcott go down the path of trying to discover if the reason for this belief by the administration is faulty intelligence or the more dangerous path of using 9/11 as an excuse for instigation of war against Hussein in a want for a regime change in Iraq, despite such most likely only destabilizing the region. With generally inexperienced Landay and Strobel not having the proverbial Rolodex of built-in contacts, Walcott is able to add to the team famed Vietnam War correspondentJoseph Lee Galloway, most recently having been hired at the State Department on September 10, 2001. Beyond their credibility or lack thereof both in going against all of mainstream media and with some of their own newspapers not printing their stories in the belief that the other media are accurate, they face an uphill battle in the court of public opinion, with Landay's Yugoslav wife, Vlatka Landay, further believing her husband putting them in potential danger in going against the government.—Huggo Journalists investigate the assertions by the Bush Administration concerning Saddam Hussein's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction as an excuse for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.in Sep 2001, the NY Twin Towers were demolished in a terrorist attack. John Walcott (Rob Reiner) is the bureau head for the Knight Rider news service in Washington. John sends reporters Warren Strobel (James Marsden) and Jonathan Landay (Woody Harrelson) to investigate. From the beginning the word from the State Dept is that Iraq is behind the attacks and while Osama is in Afghanistan.Most of the administration's case for that war made absolutely no sense, specifically the notion that Saddam Hussein was allied with Osama bin Laden. That one from the get-go rang all the bells - a secular Arab dictator allied with a radical Islamist whose goal was to overthrow secular dictators and re-establish his Caliphate? The more we examined it, the more it stank.
The defense department sent an ex-service man on a mission to Europe to find links between the WTC bombing in 1993 and Iraq. Walcott gets independent verification from his sources in Afghanistan that US military resources are being diverted to Iraq.
Walcott meets Joe Galloway (Tommy Lee Jones) a war correspondent from the Vietnam war, who now works for the administration. Walcott makes Joe an offer to work for him.Walcott runs a story on the possible outcomes of a US invasion of Afghanistan. He theorizes that the invasion, with an intention to instate Ahmed Chalabi as the leader of Afghanistan, will only lead to a break up of Iraq into mini states, trapping US troops in a civil war.
An analyst from the Pentagon comes forward and says that Donald Rumsfled is leading a parallel intelligence effort, with Chalabi and the Israelis to gather whatever flimsy evidence against Iraq to justify and invasion.The second thing was rather than relying entirely on people of high rank with household names as sources, we had sources who were not political appointees. One of the things that has gone very wrong in Washington journalism is 'source addiction,' 'access addiction,' and the idea that to maintain access to people in the White House or vice president's office or high up in a department, you have to dance to their tune. That's not what journalism is about.
We had better sources than she (Judith Miller) did, and we knew who her sources were. They were political appointees who were making a political case.I first met him (Ahmed Chalabi) in '95 or '96. I wouldn't get dressed in the morning based on what he told me the weather was, let alone go to war. - John WalcottWalcott sees evidence of all major networks siding with the Bush administration on the Iraq story, but still marshals his troops to ensure that they are asking the right questions and are finding facts to support or disprove the administrations claims. They finally get a source to admit that VP Dick Cheney is lying when he says that there is evidence to support the existence of WMDs in Iraq. So, Walcott activates Joe to get him the contradictory evidence.There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the administration is ignoring seasoned Middle East experts and Nuclear experts to make theories of their own to justify the invasion of Iraq. US moves the UNSC for a resolution against Iraq in 2003. On more than one occasion Strobel and Landay worry that their work is flawed and maybe everyone else is right. But they can't refute the evidence right in front of their eyes. They meet Chabali and come convinced that he has no plan beyond getting back to power in Iraq.Eventually, Walcott, Strobel and Landay were proven right. Iraq has been at war for 17 years since the invasion. $2 Trn spent, 36,000 Americans killed, 1 million Iraqis killed, 0 WMDs found.

But what begins as a passionate romance takes a sinister turn when Clare wakes up one morning to discover Andi has locked her in his apartment, and he has no intention of letting her leave, ever. The film opens with Clare arriving in Berlin, Germany as a young female tourist. She walks to her accommodation, a hostel with group bunking rooms and spends the evening partying with some people, possibly also tourists, on the rooftop. She takes photos of the sunrise and in the morning dresses and takes her backpack with her out sightseeing. She purchases some clothes, photo slides and takes photos in the street - one of a woman airing a colourful sheet out an apartment window. She visits a bookshop and takes interest in a book of artworks. Leaving the shop she follows out a man and they meet on the footpath waiting at a set of traffic lights. He drops his belongings and Clare assists him, after which a conversation sparks where he casually asks why she's travelling alone and offers her some strawberries. Clare goes with this man, Andi, to see the public garden where the strawberries grow.

He drives her back to her accommodation where they nearly kiss. She invites him up for a drink at the bar and he declines.The following day Clare ventures out sightseeing again and looking for Andi who she finds in the same bookshop, looking at the book of artworks. They spend the day together. He drives them back to his place which is very quiet and desolate. His upstairs apartment is tucked away behind a locked building foyer, through a small enclosed courtyard into the building block behind. They spend the night and she talks about how much she'd like to stay rather than move onto her next destination Dusseldorf. In the morning he leaves for work, teaching at a local school. One student, Franka details a book the class was asked to read.Clare gets dressed, packs up a day pack and goes to leave discovering she is locked into the apartment. She cannot find a spare key and also finds the windows don't open. Believing this an accident she hangs in the apartment, making herself some food and waits for Andi to return. He arrives home where Clare explains she couldn't leave and he realises he forgot to leave a key for her which he finds in his pocket. She jokingly suggests ""did you lock me in?"" and he playfully replies ""yes sure, but next time I'll tie you to the bed"" and they have sex in the shower. They go out clubbing and she stays a second night. In the morning when he leaves for work he points out the key he's left for her on the dresser.She casually pokes around the apartment while cooking herself breakfast and finds the book of artworks from the bookshop. She opens it to her favourite page and finds a photo of her asleep with the word 'mine' written on her shoulder, resting in the pages. Bothered by this she also realises her necklace with her ring is missing - her mother had given her the ring to ""hock and return home if she gets into trouble"" but it also has sentimental value. She searches the apartment and begins to panic, discovering the key won't open the door, her mobile phone has no service, the other internal door is also locked, and none of the available windows open. Feeling in danger now she tries to break the window with a chair and finds a second, reinforced panel behind.When Andi returns she's waiting at the door and asks to leave but he won't let her past. He locks the door and confronts her about the broken window, telling her casually if she tries to break the window he will have to border them up. Now understanding the weight of the situation she pleads for him to let her go but he dismisses her concerns and hands her flowers and asks if she likes pasta. Frustrated at his insanity she bursts violently into a rage trying to kick and punch him but he subdues her and ties her to the bed explaining that no one can hear her screams, the buildings are abandoned. The camera pans out to reveal her screams are not heard from the street.The following day Andi visits his father who asks why he was late. Andi says he met someone and tells him about Clare. His father asks about Natalie, the girl he has been seeing and Andi tells him she returned to Canada.Andi returns to the apartment where he has continued to tie Clare to the bed on a plastic sheet. She is untied for a shower as she has urinated on herself, and finds clumps of long blonde hair in the drain - realising there has been someone here before her. He brings her home a puzzle and enthusiastically tells her he told his father about her and has texted her Mum that she is okay. Clare threatens that he mum will realise the truth. He continued to ignore her.The next day Andi leaves for work, leaving Clare untied and free to roam the apartment as she cannot escape. We see him lock the keys in a lock-box and leave it on a shelf in the building corridor. Clare searches the apartment, finding a screwdriver under the couch. At work, Andi is annoyed at a teacher who uses his cup from the communal kitchen, uncomfortable the woman empties it and washes it out.He returns home to find Clare doing the puzzle, he helps her and she takes the opportunity to stab the screwdriver through his hand resting on the tabletop, pinning him to the table. She grabs the keys and escapes down the stairwell and across the courtyard, but a clunky door jams and Andi catches her and crushes her hand in the door as she escapes through the front building, breaking her finger. He carries a passed out Clare back to the apartment.The following day he meets his father. When he returns home Clare tries to return calmness to the hostile situation. She continues to plead to him and tells him she misses her Mum but Andi tells her, there's no point missing something you won't get back, and that she has him instead. Andi constantly takes photos of Clare in odd and disturbed poses, usually naked.The next day Andi watches the female student, Franka in gym class, aroused. Meanwhile, Clare attempts to pick the door locks with a paperclip, snapping one off in the internal door, and worries Andi will discover her attempt. We see that Andi has locked all the sharp tools in the lock-box with the key. He continues to taunt and intimidate Clare both mentally and emotionally, moving between affection, possessiveness and cruelty. Andi is washing Clare in the shower when Franka knocks at the door. Andi threatens Clare that if she says anything, he will kill the girl. Andi answers the door and Franka flirts with him, stating she followed him home. Seeing Clare standing in a towel in the hallway, Andi tells her she's his girlfriend and is cruel to her so she leaves. Back inside the apartment Clare enquires about the girl, asking her name, and Andi cuts her hair - again photographing her. Later he discovers the internal door won't open and gets cross with Clare.We see time pass, it's now Christmas. Clare is living in terror, but as Andi continues to toy with her she begins to unravel and act out, Andi at one point asking her to be 'normal' and gets violent in his frustration at her behaviour, leaving to stay with his father. The power in the apartment goes out and Clare is stuck for days without power - it's freezing cold and she eats the little food she finds. Andi's father dies and upset, he waits a few days to call the caretaker, remaining in his fathers house. Clare finds another girls toenail trimming under the bed. Clare is relieved when Andi returns to the apartment a few days later. Andi was unaware of the power outage and tells him ""she thought he wasn't coming back"". She comforts him about his father's passing and they make love.Clare begins warming to the situation, cleaning, cooking, making an effort with her appearance, playing music. Andi gives her a book and his father's dog for Christmas. Clare asks the details of why he chose her and he explains he saw her in the street looking at the woman airing the sheet out the window, unveiling that he had planned their meeting in the bookshop. Clare asks about the previous girl, and we see a sudden shift in his affection for Clare, annoyed at her questions.Some time later, he takes her from the apartment into an isolated forest. He's carrying an axe. While Clare appreciates being outside finally he lifts his axe behind her. But a young boy shouts and runs over, interrupting, asking to help his brother who has hurt his leg. Surprised at their presence, Andi is distracted and Clare seizes an opportunity to try to alert the other boy, but he doesn't understand english and is frightened by her urgency. Andi notices and is angry at Clare. When the mother collects her children, Andi leads Clare back to the car and forces her into the boot, returning to the apartment. Andi now annoyed at Clare's presence and jealous of her relationship with the dog, takes the dog for a walk and doesn't return with it, stating it 'ran away'. Clare is alone again and heartbroken.While Andi attends a New Year's Eve party, Clare breaks into the locked room, finding his camera, a massage chair, and a photo album of Clare in captivity. Clare also finds an album of another girl, blonde, bound and abused in the same way. Andi attempts to lure another young female tourist, sparking conversation and using the same miss-wording he used with Clare, confusing 'contemplate life' with 'compensate life', but the girl leaves with her friend. Back in the kitchen, Clare notices a torchlight shining from another apartment across the courtyard and alerts the person to her distress, screaming and smashing the repaired window pane. A man reaches the apartment door nearly freeing Clare, but Andi returns and kills him with a hammer. Andi taunts Clare that it is her fault the man is dead and forces her to help wrap up the body which he burns in the coal pit in courtyard outside.The following day Andi cleans the blood and boards up the windows, punishing Clare. He notices a missing persons ad in the local paper, with Clare's picture and flustered asks Clare to pack her bags because he is fumigating the apartment. Clare notices student workbooks on the table that Andi is grading. She purposefully burns her hand and while Andi grabs some cream from the bathroom, she stashes away Franka's workbook.The following morning Andi tips out all the drinks and takes his and Clare's bags, leaving Clare behind in the apartment. Downstairs he stashes Clare's bag in the basement and turns off the pipes, leaving Clare without water. At school he hands out the workbooks and Franka finds a photo of Clare bound and gagged slipped between the pages. Without drawing attention to her discovery, Franka excuses herself from the classroom and flees promptly on her bike. The photo is found on the floor by the other students and panicked, Andi rushes back to the apartment, getting stuck in traffic. Andi finds Franka's bike outside the front building and sees where she has broken in through a basement window. He finds the hammer and the lock-box open in the courtyard, and a window in the building block open. The apartment door is open and Clare is gone. He follows muddy footsteps up the stairwell and we see him follow them past Clare hiding in a stairwell cupboard. Just as he reaches the room where Franka is hiding, Clare calls from downstairs, luring him back into the apartment. Once he is distracted inside, Clare manages to slip out and lock the apartment door with Andi now trapped inside.A wave of euphoric relief washes over Clare as she realises she is finally free from the apartment and Andi. Andi now pleading for Clare to free him from the apartment, she screams in victory, chucking the keys against the outside of the door, taunting Andi. She collects Franks and has found a bag with her passport and her mothers ring. The final shots are of Andi relaxing in his massage chair and Clare riding in a car through Berlin, passing tourists sightseeing, enjoying her freedom."

However, as she tries to make her escape, she is surrounded by cops. She smiles a grim smile.The assassin is shown in a room in an unnamed facility. She is drugged and is given plastic surgery. While recuperating she has a flashback showing an unnamed man with a mustache trying to resuscitate her after a breath holding exercise. He is calling her Sook-hee.The facility turns out to be part of South Korea's intelligence agency and is run by a woman named Kwon-sook.

Sook-hee is hiding under a bed and doesn't get a look at the killer's face, she only hears him whistling an eerie tune. When a man comes back into the room, we are shown that this person is Jang-Chun, the unnamed man with yellow teeth. Jang-Chun was a friend of Sook-hee's father. Her father had stolen a diamond. Jang-Chun sells Sook-hee to a prostitution ring. Sook-hee is about to be forcibly raped by a prostitution client when the unnamed man with a mustache arrives and rescues her. We learn his name is Lee Joong-sang. And we learn how it came about that Joong-sang trained Sook-hee to be this killing machine and why she is so devoted to him.Having completed her first assignment, Yeon-soo is released from the facility and will continue to work for the agency from her own apartment that she shares with her daughter Eun-hye. Unknown to Yeon-soo, Kwon-sook has placed a male agent in the apartment beside Yeon-soo's apartment.

Joong-sang sees that his trained assassin would no longer be of much use, so he sets up an act. He stages a wedding with her and pays people to attend the wedding and while on their honeymoon, he fakes saving a gang member called Choi-Chun-Mo and stages his own death. When Sook-hee hears he is dead, she loses her mind and goes on a killing rampage and takes out the whole gang (who she thinks is behind Joong-sang's death). Joong-sang has eliminated his rivals and Joong-sang expects Sook-hee to be killed because of her rage and the sheer numbers of the gang. But they are no match.

In a callback to the earlier story the agency pays people to attend the wedding and Yeon-soo in her wedding gown aims a rifle out a window to her target, who she sees through the rifle scope is: Joong-sang. She can't kill him, shocked that he's still alive.Joong-sang backtracks the location from which the shots come and identifies Yeon-soo as Sook-hee from the wedding photos. He makes contact with Yeon-soo to verify that it is actually her. He tapes a conversation of the agency and sends it to Yeon-soo.

Senan is rather passive, whereas his Cured friend, Conor (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), appears quite remorseless and blames society for their situation. Conor appears to have considerable, unspoken influence over Senan. Senan meets his 'Rehabilitation Officer', Sergeant Cantor (Stuart Graham), who clearly has little faith that the Cured can integrate back into society without further violence. Cantor acts like a parole officer and shows little compassion for Senan.Senan reunites with his sister-in-law, Abbie (Ellen Page), who has a young son, named Cillian (Oscar Nolan). Cillian quickly begins to bond with his uncle. Abbie soon inquires to Senan as to what became of her husband, Luke, Senan's brother who is still among the missing. Senan claims ignorance of his fate, though it is revealed in one of Senan's many flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then killed his brother Luke, in the very flat that Abbie lives in. The Cured have a detailed memory of what they have done while infected; many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress.Conor, formerly a young lawyer with political aspirations, approaches his father seeking a job with a law firm. His father, also a lawyer, accuses Conor of killing Conor's mother and other atrocities while infected. Sergeant Cantor later confronts Conor and Senan and forcefully tells Conor to have no further contact with his family. Conor begins to form an underground political faction called the Cured Alliance, whose goal is ostensibly to regain many of the civil liberties that the Cured have lost. It is announced in various news broadcasts that the government is planning to euthanize the 25% (5,000 patients) who are infected, despite the assertions of a prominent virologist that a better vaccine for the Infected is nearly developed. Senan takes a job at the hospital where the Infected are housed, and observes that the Infected show no interest in attacking the Cured. This is a source of political tension in the community, as the never-infected suspect aloud that the Cured would love to see another outbreak of the Maze Virus, as they would be largely immune to its effects.Conor attempts to recruit Senan into the Cured Alliance, but Senan initially appears uninterested, wanting only to settle into family life and forget the past. However, the public at large have become hostile towards the Cured living in their midst, and eventually Senan agrees to go on an arson mission with Conor to gain some political leverage. The mission was intended to be free of casualties, but a soldier is killed and Cantor suspects Senan and Conor. Cantor approaches Abbie at her flat and educates her on the nature of the people infected with the Maze Virus. He tells her that the infected are linked in some telepathic manner, and that they form into packs like predatory animals. He voices his suspicions that the predatory traits are not eliminated by the vaccine, and that the Cured are still very dangerous. When Abbie shows skepticism, Cantor shows her a photograph of Conor and Senan roaming together when they were infected. Conor appeared to be leading Senan in murderous acts in the photo. Conor later approaches Abbie, and tacitly admits that he and Senan killed her husband while they were infected during the early days of the outbreak. Conor shows her a ghastly scar on his shoulder and tells her that her husband, Luke, did indeed try to fight back but was overcome by himself and Senan.Abbie confronts Senan, and he tearfully admits that he killed Luke after Conor infected him. She tells him to get out, and Senan finally realizes that Conor has no remorse for what he has done in the past, and what he is still doing. Senan assists Cantor in a sting operation to arrest Conor after he confesses aloud to the arson; however, Conor violently murders Cantor and flees after showing a rare emotional outburst, blaming Senan for betraying him. Conor asserts that Senan is a fool for believing that anyone other than other Cured people care anything about him now. Conor and the Cured Alliance set in motion a drastic plan to free the Infected from their cell-block. The Infected are freed from their captivity and they take to the streets, killing and infecting new victims and causing mass chaos. Irish Army troops are deployed to the streets in an attempt to quell the emergency. Senan finds Abbie, who is frantically trying to retrieve Cillian from his school. Senan rescues Cillian but is confronted by Conor, who beats him savagely. A soldier shoots Conor but he escapes and his fate is unknown. Senan, Abbie and Cillian return to their flat, but Cillian is bit by an infected person and begins showing immediate signs of infection. Senan, knowing he is immune, takes Cillian, and tells Abbie he will keep him safe until another vaccine is available.An unspecified time later, a news broadcast announces that order has been restored, although 8,000 new infected people are now in captivity. During the announcement Abbie is seen walking down the street alone. In the background promotional posters of Conor (as the voice of the Cured/Cured Alliance) can be seen; showing that he is not only alive but has obtained his goal of being a leader. It is publicized that some infected are now in hiding, as the government is again discussing euthanasia for the inevitable 25% who are Resistant. Watching the broadcast, Abbie bursts into tears, knowing that Senan is hiding somewhere with the infected Cillian, and that the government cannot be trusted but that the only hope for her son is another government vaccine."

November,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6164502/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a poor Estonian village, a group of peasants use magic and folk remedies to survive the winter, and a young woman tries to get a young man to love her. ""November"" is based on Estonian novel ""Rehepapp"" by Andrus Kivirähk, a bestseller of the last twenty years. The film is a mixture of magic, black humor and romantic love. The story is set in a pagan Estonian village where werewolves, the plague, and spirits roam. The villagers' main problem is how to survive the cold, dark winter. And, to that aim, nothing is taboo. People steal from each other, from their German manor lords, and from spirits, the devil, and Christ. To guard their souls, they'll give them away to thieving creatures made of wood and metal called kratts, who help their masters by stealing more. They steal even if their barns are already overflowing. Stealing is an obsession that makes the villagers more and more like the soulless creatures they command, the kratts. The main character of the film is a young farm girl named Liina who is hopelessly and forlornly in love with a village boy named Hans. Her longing makes the girl become a werewolf and jump into an ice-cold pond. She's ready to die in the name of love. The pragmatic farmers are faced with a question: is the life that they've won through so much toil worth anything, if it lacks a soul? Estonian pagan and European Christian mythologies come together in this film. Both mythologies look for a miracle; for an ancient force that gives one a soul. This film is about souls - longing for a soul, selling your soul, and living without a soul."

Wendy (Dakota Fanning) - a brilliant young woman with autism and a fixation on Star Trek - lives a routine life in an Oakland, California group home where she is monitored by her primary caregiver, Scottie (Toni Collette). She spends her time writing a 450-page Star Trek script to enter in Paramount Pictures' screenwriting contest in hopes of winning the $100,000 prize. Wendy is visited by her sister Audrey (Alice Eve), who shows Wendy pictures of her infant daughter, Ruby, and reveals that she is selling their childhood home. Wendy asks Audrey to take her home, arguing that she will be able to buy back the house and help Audrey care for Ruby once she wins the screenwriting contest. Audrey refuses, informing Wendy she isn't capable of caring for a baby. Unfortunately, Wendy has a meltdown and Audrey leaves the group home weeping.After Wendy misses the mail-in date to send her script to Paramount Pictures, she decides to deliver the script herself. She leaves the group home early the next morning and is followed by the group home's small dog, Pete. Wendy and Pete board a bus to Los Angeles, but are kicked off and left by the side of the road after Pete urinates on the bus. Wendy then wanders into a shanty town, where she is robbed of most of her money. She then wanders to a nearby shop and is nearly swindled out of the last of her money by an employee. An elderly woman named Rose (Marla Gibbs) intervenes to stop the employee from exploiting Wendy. Rose sympathizes with Wendy as her grandson also has autism, and lets Wendy accompany her on the senior citizens' bus. The bus driver subsequently falls asleep at the wheel, crashing the bus without warning.Following the bus crash, Wendy wakes up in a hospital in Bakersfield. Still determined to deliver her script as planned, Wendy leaves Pete at the hospital and escapes. During her escape, Wendy loses part of her script by chance. She gathers used paper and begins rewriting the script. Simultaneously, Audrey and Scottie have realized Wendy is missing. They begin to search for her and file a missing persons report. After correctly deducing that Wendy left for Los Angeles to personally deliver her script, Scottie and her son Sam (River Alexander) leave on the road. The Bakersfield hospital notifies Scottie and Audrey of Wendy's whereabouts; police continue the search from there. Scottie and Sam find the missing script pages while scouring the hospital.Wendy then attempts to buy a bus ticket to Los Angeles, but is unable as she has no money. She ultimately stows away on the next bus to Los Angeles, hiding herself inside a baggage compartment. Upon her arrival in Los Angeles, Wendy wanders around until two police officers recognize her from the missing persons report. Fortunately, Officer Frank (Patton Oswalt) gains Wendy's trust by speaking to her in Klingon. The officers bring Wendy to the police station, where she is reunited with Audrey and Scottie. They bring Wendy to Paramount Pictures so she can deliver her script as planned. Wendy runs away from the group home because her sister doesn't trust her being away from Scottie, therefore Audrey refuses to drive Wendy to the post office to drop off her script.Despite being stonewalled by a bad-mannered mailroom worker, Wendy is able to sneak past security and submit the script to the turn-in box. Satisfied that she has completed her mission, Wendy informs her sister she did this to prove that she was more capable than Audrey thought. Wendy returns to the group home where she later receives a letter from Paramount Pictures informing her that her script was not chosen, but encouraging her to continue writing. Despite the rejection from the movie studio, she is satisfied with everything she has accomplished. Wendy visits Audrey at their childhood home and holds her niece in her arms for the first time, while Audrey embraces Wendy."

The Vault,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1785635/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two estranged sisters are forced to rob a bank in order to save their brother. But this is no ordinary bank. The film opens with a series of shots of newspaper clippings about a bank robbery involving hostages, that resulted in a standoff with police lasting several days. This series of clippings ends in a shot of a masked man holding up a lighter. This cuts away to a billowing cloud of smoke rising from a building and firetrucks racing by to extinguish the fire.Elsewhere, assistant bank manager Ed is seen standing alone in a break-room, quick cuts of disturbing content, including the same masked man from the beginning of the film, as well as several other people with bloody bags over their heads are shown, interspersed with close shots of Ed's face.Out in the main lobby, a man is let into the bank by a policeman stationed at the door. He walks over to a self-serve coffee station and pours himself a cup of coffee, spiking it with a small bottle of liquor. He proceeds to go up to the teller, and completes his transaction, asking the teller out for a drink during ""happy hour"". The teller remarks that it seems the man had already been drinking, and hands him his receipt, prompting him to leave. On his way out, the policeman at the door addresses him as a detective, and the man responds by telling the police officer to keep the people in the bank away from the fire down the block.While this is all happening, a young woman named Leah is sitting in a waiting area, and is called over by the bank's manager. She enters his office and hands over her resume, indicating that she is here to apply for a position as a teller. The bank manager tells her that they have three teller spots to fill, as the tellers that he has hired in the past keep quitting. When Leah asks the manager why they keep quitting, he hesitates, but after reassuring the bank manager that she still wants the position, the bank manager reluctantly tells her that the tellers all quit after seeing and hearing ""spooky"" things in the basement of the bank.Outside of the office, back in the lobby, another woman, Vee, walks up to a teller and begins to complain that several cheques she has written have bounced, leading to charges from both the bank and the people the cheques were written out to. Vee becomes increasingly irate, using profanities, and asks for a manager. In the background, the police officer, as well as a security guard for the bank begin to approach her, but the police officer returns to the door to let in a group of firefighters, presumably responders from the fire nearby. Finally, becoming fed up with Vee's use of profanity, and refusal to quiet down and act civil, the security guard attempts to arrest her. Vee struggles against him, hitting him with brass knuckles pulled from her pocket. Seeing this, the police officer calls in a disturbance at the bank over his police radio, and goes to subdue Vee. Suddenly, Leah, back in the manager's office, pulls out a shotgun and holds the manager at gunpoint, while one of the 'firefighters' hits the police officer with the flat edge of his axe, knocking him unconscious.It is revealed that Leah, Vee, and the three men disguised as firefighters, Kramer, Michael, and Cyrus, are all part of the same crew working to rob the bank. After taking hostages of all the staff and clients in the bank, and forcing the head teller, Susan, to open the vault, the Michael begins to move hostages into the vault, while Kramer forces Susan to open the vault's cash deposit box, which is disappointingly nearly empty. Kramer takes the bag of money back out to the lobby where he tells the rest of the group that there is only about $70,000 dollar, which is nowhere near their goal of $500,000. An argument ensues between the members of the crew about what they should do next, some saying that they should cut their losses, and make a run for it; the others saying that they should stay and keep looking for more money, because they need to pay back a debt, and they cannot leave without the money.Ed, now a hostage, yells over to the crew that he knows where there is more money in the bank, and that he will help them. The crew holds him at gunpoint demanding more information. Ed agrees to tell them if they promise not to hurt anybody else. The crew agrees, and Ed tells them that there is an old vault in the basement of the bank that holds over $6 million in cash. Imbued with a new sense of urgency at this news, Kramer takes a drill and goes down to the basement to drill out the vault and open it, stating that it will take about 20 minutes. Leah and Cyrus take Ed to the security office to observe to proceedings over the live camera feeds, and Michael goes to the vault with the hostages to watch them. Vee stays in the lobby of the bank.In the vault the hostages plead to Michael's good nature, telling him that they don't think he is a bad man, and asking him to let them go. He tells them all to shut up, at which point Susan tells Michael that she needs to go to the washroom. Michael reluctantly takes her to the washroom, at which point she again pleads with Michael to rethink taking them as hostages. In the washroom Michael reveals that Vee and Leah are his sisters, and they are helping him rob this bank because he owes money to bad people, and can't afford to pay them back. Susan, yet again asks Michael to let her go, but Michael ignores these requests again, and brings her back to the vault when she tells him she can't go when he is pacing outside the stall door. Upon seeing Michael, Vee tells him to go start cutting through a pipe in the basement that wills serve as the group's means of escape once they have raided the vault. Michael agrees and goes down to the basement, to a different section than Kramer.During these events, ever since Kramer began drilling in the basement, the lights had been flickering in the bank. The group finds it odd, but dismisses it as a power surge. Kramer, finishing up the drilling job in the basement begins to try to open the vault, at which time Vee, Leah, and Cyrus watch him through the cameras. When he looks up from his tools, Kramer sees a silhouette at the end of the dimly lit hallway, and, assuming its a member of the crew, tells them to go back upstairs and watch the hostages. The figure remains, not moving, and Kramer looks through his tools for a flashlight, which doesn't work. Looking back up, he sees a second silhouette has appeared, and begins just staring at them. Confused at his behaviour, as the figures cannot be seen on the camera feeds, Vee radios Kramer, asking him what he is doing. Kramer tries to respond, but only static comes through to Vee, Leah, and Cyrus. Hearing a noise behind him, Kramer turns to see the masked man from the beginning of the film, and looking back at where the two silhouettes were, sees they have multiplied into four. Looking back and forth as the silhouettes slowly grow in number and move towards him, Kramer screams, which is heard by Michael, and falls backwards into the vault, and out of sight of the camera feed. Ed is the only one in the room who doesn't look shocked by these events, and has been staring at the screen with a straight face the whole time.Concerned, Vee goes runs to the basement door, which closes on its own just as she reaches it, locking itself. At the same time, Cyrus goes into the vault to check on the hostages, and Leah stands guard in the lobby. Cyrus is asked to count the hostages and make sure they are all there, and begins counting, only to see that some of the hostages have dirty and bloody bags over their heads, pressed into their eye sockets and mouths, making them look like skulls. These are the same in appearance as the hostages seen in Ed's visions from the beginning of the film, and standing behind them is the masked man. The vault door slowly closes, locking Cyrus in, and he begins to fight with the nightmarish hostages, managing to pull one of their hoods off, revealing a heavily charred corpse underneath. Cyrus is then forced to the ground, and the masked man puts the barrel of a shotgun into Cyrus' mouth, forcing Cyrus to pull the trigger. This sound is masked by the sound of Vee shooting out the lock on the Basement door.While this is happening, Michael, who had heard Kramer screaming earlier, has gone to investigate, and upon reaching the vault, finds Kramer sitting inside with a bloody rag over his face. Pulling it off, Michael sees that Kramer's eyes had been gouged out, but that he was still breathing. At this time, Kramer starts to gasp, and puts his vault drill through his own head, killing himself. Michael back out of the vault, terrified.Back in the security office, Leah is questioning Ed about whether he knew what was going on, accusing him of setting them up. Ed swears he has no clue what is going on, at which point the phone rings. Leah picks it up and puts it up to Ed's ear, telling him to make them go away. However, it is the detective who was in the bank earlier, identifying himself as Tom, and he demands to speak with Leah. Realizing that the police know they are robbing the bank, as up until this point the crew thought that nobody was aware of their actions, Leah hangs up the phone. Demanding answers, Leah gets Susan from the Vault and asks her if she was the one who contacted the police. She denies it and says that it was the bank itself. Susan explains that in 1982 a man tried robbing the bank, taking many hostages, and demanded transportation. This is the robbery from the clippings in the beginning shots of the film, and the robber is the man in the mask. Susan explains that the man held out for several days without food or water, and that in the end he snapped, executing the hostages in various ways, including burning several of them alive in the vault. According to Susan, the police kept finding more and more bodies, but never found the masked man, or any trace of him. Susan is sure that the masked man is still in the basement, and that he is the source of the crew's trouble. Leah does not believe Susan, and threatens to electrocute her with a broken lamp that is still plugged in. Michael catches her before she can hurt Susan though, and walks away disappointed.Vee returns from checking the basement with a duffel bag full of cash. Leah remarks that something is wrong, however, and upon closer inspection, she sees that every bill was printed in 1982, the same year of the robbery that Susan was speaking of. Vee is unconcerned by this, and tells Leah that she is going insane, which causes a fight between the two. Suddenly, a window near them shatters, which Leah and Vee assume is the police shooting at them. Michael returns to the basement to continue cutting the pipe for their escape. He hears a woman calling for help, and after following the voice down a corridor, finds a young lady laying on the ground, asking for help. She says that she thinks that her ankle is broken, and asks Michael is he is ""one of them"" Michael is confused by this. He hears Vee call for him and turns to face the source of the sound. When he looks back, the woman has become a rotting corpse, which lunges after Michael.Back up in the Managers office, Leah gets a phone call, and when she picks up, she hears a staticky voice inform her that a robbery is happening at the bank she is in. She knows that this cannot be anyone of her hostages, and is slowly becoming convinced of Susan's story. Meanwhile, Vee is speaking to Ed, who asks her what she plans on doing next, as she seems to be the only one with any sanity left. This is out of the ordinary for Ed, who hasn't commented on any of the odd occurrences up until this point. Almost immediately after the call indicating a robbery in progress, Leah gets another call from the Detective, apologizing for the shot that was taken at Leah and Vee. Leah says that she can only keep control of the situation for so long, and to keep the police at bay a little longer, releases one of the hostages. After releasing the hostage, Leah gets yet another call, and it is the same ghostly call from earlier, complaining of a robbery at the bank. Susan, who is sitting near the phone, looks up at Leah and asks her if she heard 'it'.Returning to the basement, Vee beings to search for Michael. In one room she finds Cyrus' body, with his head blown of from the jaw up, with blood splattered all over the wall behind him. Going a bit further she sees Michael, looking deranged, and splashing gasoline all over the walls of the corridors. Seeing Vee, Michael grabs her and tells her that the escape pipe has been cut and is ready for her to escape through, and tells her to run. Vee asks Michael what he is doing, and begs him to go with her, but he picks his jerry can back up and continues to douse the walls in gas. Vee returns to the vault and begins to look inside it, as Michael lights the gasoline and begins to burn the bank. As the fire alarms start to go off Ed, with whom Leah is now with, indicates that now the police will be forced to come into the bank. Leah, realizing that she is running out of time, cuts Ed free, gives him a knife, and tells him to let the rest of the hostages go. She then grabs the duffel bag of cash and runs down to the basement.In the basement Michael has begun to throw Molotov cocktails into rooms as he walks by them, spreading the fire. Leah runs to the escape pipe, but thinks she hears Michael calling for her, so she runs in the direction of the voice, eventually coming to the vault. When she enters the vault, she spaces out for a moment, but soon becomes aware that the ghosts of the hostages are now surrounding her, and the vault door is closing. She manages to get her arm through the vault door and is trying to pry it open, and eventually manages to when Michael comes to the vault and helps her. Together they run from the ghost hostages, Michael throwing Molotov cocktails behind him as they go. Eventual he falls behind, and Leah makes it to the pipe first. She calls for Michael but begins to hear a song playing lightly down the hallway. Out of the fire's smoke appears the masked man, as well as several of the hostage ghosts, with Michael following behind them. Realizing that they are about to kill Leah, Michael opens a gas line and lights it, blowing up the masked man and the other ghosts just as Leah entered the escape pipe.The next shot shows Leah driving down a back road, with the radio playing in the background. The radio host is talking about the robbery, and says that police believe all the suspects to be dead. Leah pulls to a stop on the side of the road, and the camera pans over to Vee, who is revealed to have made it out safely. Vee angrily asks where the money is, and what happened to Michael. Leah gets the duffel bag of money out of her car, and throws it at Vee's feet, explaining that Michael had died, and begging Vee to tell her that she saw the ghosts too, and that she was not going crazy. Vee explains that she doesn't know what she saw, and that all she remembers is the police shooting at her.In a police interrogation room, the Detective Tom is questioning the hostages about who helped the robbers with the codes, the vault and disarming the alarm systems. Every hostage says that they did not recognize Ed, even though he claimed to be the assistant bank manager. When questioning Susan, one of the only hostages to have admitted to seeing Ed, she recognizes Ed's picture on the wall of the police interrogation room. Detective Tom tells her this is impossible, as Ed was one of the original victims of the 1982 bank robbery. Susan realizes that Ed himself was a ghost, and that was how he knew about the basement vault. The film then cuts to the same scene from the beginning of the movie with Ed in the break-room. This time, however, he hears screams and gunshots from outside the break-room, and calls the police, which is recognizable as the same call that Leah had been hearing throughout the robbery.Back at Leah and Vee's meet-up point, Leah's car won't start, prompting Vee to get out and check the engine. Suddenly the radio turns on, and every station is playing the same thing, which is the song that Leah heard in the basement of the bank. When Vee drops the cars hood, Leah sees the masked man behind her, and screams as he snaps Vee's neck, and the credits start to roll."

When Kronos goes online, it quickly determines that mankind, itself, is the biggest threat to world peace and launches a worldwide robot attack to rid the world of the ""infection"" of man. Ninety-seven years later, a small band of humans remain alive but on the run from the robot army. A teenage boy, Andrew (Julian Schaffner) and a teenage girl, Calia (Jeannine Wacker), form an unlikely alliance to reach a new world, where it is rumored mankind exists without fear of robot persecution. But does this world actually exist? And will they live long enough to find out? 2020. It's been three years since VA Industries, led by genius Elias Van Dorne, revolutionized the way humans live with VA supplied robots now in three-quarters of all the world's households. In a misstep, VA got into the business of military robots in the wanted goal of world peace, with the exact opposite occurring in the robots having led to greater and more violent war. Now, Van Dorne has come up with an artificial intelligence called Kronos which he believes is the ultimate in robotics. In the mysterious worldwide broadcast launching Kronos which Van Dorne has not yet divulged what it is to do or accomplish, Van Dorne unleashes Kronos on the world, it which is to destroy the human race, which Kronos has determined is the cause of the world's problems. Van Dorne has uploaded a virtual version of himself and his colleague Damien Walsh into Kronos to oversee its progress on the mission to eliminate the human race. Fast forward to 2117. There are still pockets of humans who have been able to evade Kronos, the current survivors descendants of those who were able to survive in 2020. Purportedly, the largest pocket of resistance is in Aurora, its location which Kronos does not know. As such, Van Dorne, through Kronos, has created a robot in the form of a young human man to locate Aurora. He has created it the form and memory of a man who was in existence in 2020, Andrew Davis, the robot which truly does believe it is Andrew Davis with his memories. The robot is to befriend a young resistance fighter, Calia, who is trying to locate Aurora herself. Complications ensue as Van Dorne has created a robot arguably more human than humans themselves, that robot of Andrew which may ultimately work on his own human driven emotions.—Huggo"

Joan thinks it's time for a fresh start in a new place, but Belle thinks nothing will change for the better regarding James's condition.Belle starts at a new school.

Meanwhile, Juliet is spooked by a demonic reflection in the lake.Belle tells her mom about the theory that James is possessed, even if it sounds crazy.

Belle later tries to break out of the house with James, but Joan knocks her out.Belle wakes up at 3:15 AM.

Then she starts to hallucinate and reminisce.—grantss EditJessie and Gerald arrive at an isolated lake house in Fairhope, Alabama, for some time away. While Gerald takes Viagra, Jessie feeds a stray dog outside, but when re-entering the house notices the door is left ajar. Jessie changes into a new night dress, placing the tag on a shelf above the bed, and practices sexy poses. Gerald takes a second Viagra and leaves his glass of water on the same shelf. He restrains Jessie with one handcuff on each wrist locked to the bedposts. She seems a bit surprised by this, but goes along. He begins to enact a stranger rape fantasy, telling her to scream for help, knowing no one will hear. She half heartedly plays along but soon becomes uncomfortable, telling him to stop and uncuff her; he replies, ""What if I won't?"" After a heated argument where he accuses her of not even trying to rekindle their relationship, Gerald dies of a heart attack, falling onto the floor, leaving Jessie in handcuffs.The dog enters and Jessie tries to scare it away, but it bites a chunk out of Gerald's arm and eats it.

She gloats to Gerald, but then turns around and tells herself, the one still trapped, that it is easy to escape. Gerald and the self-assured Jessie tell things about herself and Gerald that she never had the courage to acknowledge. They trigger her to remember the glass of water above the bed, which she is able to reach but cannot bring all the way to her mouth. The hallucinations remind her of the tag she put on the shelf, which she rolls into a straw in order to reach the water.Jessie falls asleep, wakes up in the dark, and sees a tall, deformed, obscured figure who reveals a bag of various bones and trinkets. She closes her eyes saying ""You're not real."" But Gerald appears to say that the figure is Death waiting to take her. Gerald begins to call Jessie ""Mouse"", which unsettles her. This triggers a memory of her father, Tom, who affectionately referred to her as ""Mouse."" She is 12 years old, vacationing at a lake house with her family. As Jessie and her father sit alone outside to watch a solar eclipse, he suggests she sit on his lap, as she did when she was younger. Once on his lap, he masturbates. The handcuffed Jessie awakes to intense pain due to her circulation being cut off and cramping. Gerald and the confident Jessie are skeptical about her claims that she dealt with the pressure of keeping such a secret, and her claims that it had nothing to do with her marriage, even though she married a man just like her father. Gerald teases Jessie about the disfigured man she saw, who he calls ""the man made of moonlight"", and points out what he suspects is a bloody footprint on the floor. After the eclipse, her father tells her he was ashamed of what he did, and manipulates her into agreeing never to tell anyone.Jessie remembers cutting her hand that night, when she squeezed a glass too hard when her mother asked her about the eclipse. The adult Jessie smashes the water glass and cuts her wrist in a way that enables her to peel back the skin, allowing her bloody hand to slip through the cuff. She drags the bed to the key, unlocking her other hand. She drinks water and bandages herself, but then passes out on the floor from blood loss and fatigue. When she wakes, the ""man made of moonlight"" is at the end of the hall, and she gives him her wedding ring for his trinket bag.

She used some of Gerald's life insurance to start a foundation for victims of sexual abuse. But each night the ""man made of moonlight"" still appears before her as she falls asleep. Her wedding ring was never found in the house, and she learned from the news that a man who has acromegaly, causing disfiguration of his head, is a serial killer who dug up crypts, stealing bones and jewels, and occasionally eating the faces of male corpses. This explains why he did not harm Jessie in the house and also why Gerald's face was disfigured. Jessie arrives at court as the moonlight man is being sentenced, and calls for his attention.

A group of friends reunite after a long time to plan a vacation. They finally decide to go on a hiking trip in Sweden, Northern Europe. When one of them is injured, they have no choice but to cut through the forest in order to arrive at the lodge a couple of hours sooner. During a raging rainstorm, they spent the night in a spooky, abandoned house. What awaits them are things they never expect out of this supposedly bonding trip.—Naemen Five old friends from university--Phil, Dom, Hutch, Luke, and Rob--meet over drinks at a pub, and discuss plans for a group trip to catch up with one another. Rob suggests hiking in Sweden, Eastern Europe, but is quickly shot down by the others. Later in the evening, the group exits the pub and passes a shop. Luke wishes to stop and purchase a bottle of Vodka, which Rob accompanies him in doing. While conversing in the shop, the pair notices the distressed cashier slumped against the wall behind the register. Two armed robbers emerge from the back room, and Luke hides behind a shelf at the end of the aisle, leaving Rob frozen in fear. The robbers antagonize Rob, demanding his wallet, watch, and ring. Rob parts with the first two willingly, but refuses to give them his ring, as it is his wedding band. Luke, still hidden from sight, flips the bottle in his hand and prepares to intervene. However, he is too slow to act, and Rob is bludgeoned to death before his eyes.To honor Rob's wish, the four embark on a hiking trip along Kungsleden, or King's Trail, in Sarek National Park in northern Sweden six months after his death. When Dom loses his footing and injures his knee, impairing his ability to walk, Hutch consults the map and decides that an alternate route through a forest off the trail will take them half the time. Upon entering the forest, the group encounters strange phenomena, including a gutted elk hanging from the tree branches and strange symbols carved on the trees.As night falls, a torrential rainstorm soaks the men. While looking for shelter, they come upon an abandoned cabin and decide to break in and stay overnight. Inside the cabin, they find necklaces hanging from the walls that depict similar symbols as the runes carved in the tree. While exploring the second floor of the cabin, Phil discovers a strange wooden effigy that is shaped like a decapitated human torso with antlers for hands.During the night, the four are plagued by nightmares. Upon waking the next morning, Luke finds that he has sustained a set of strange puncture wounds on his chest. The group finds Phil in the attic, naked and kneeling in prayer in front of the effigy.The group leaves the cabin to continue their travels deeper into the woods, trying to find a way out.Upon climbing a ridge in order to gain some perspective regarding their location, Luke sees a human-like hand wrapped around the trunk of a distant tree. While trying to discuss his findings with the group, Dom is doubtful of his report. An argument ensues wherein Dom reveals that he blames Luke for Rob's death, and calls Luke cowardly for failing to act during the robbery.Later that night, Luke is woken from another nightmare by screams. Discovering that Hutch's tent is empty, the three rush deeper into the woods, following Hutch's screams. By dawn, they realize that they have become lost and cannot recall where their campsite was. They decide to continue their search without their tents and supplies. The three come upon Hutch impaled on tree branches, much like the gutted deer they had found earlier. The group retrieves Hutch's body for his compass and knife, and then give him an impromptu burial by covering his body with tree branches.Luke leaves Phil and Dom on the lower part of a ridge, climbing a hill that provides an overview of the entire forest. He realizes that they are relatively close to the edge of the forest, and also spots smoke rising from distant campfires. He rejoins the two to tell them the news, but finds them with their flashlights pointed towards the trees, saying they heard a noise. Suddenly, Phil is dragged off-screen by an unseen creature. Upon seeking a hiding spot, Luke encounters Dom, and urges him to run with him. They get to their feet and begin to run, the creature giving chase. They pass Phil's body impaled on the branches of a tree near a path of torches that leads to a small village. They seek shelter in the first building they seen, and collapse on the cabin floor, only to be beaten unconscious by its occupants.When they awaken, they find themselves restrained by their hands in a basement. An elderly woman enters the basement and inspects the puncture marks on Luke's chest. She pulls down her dress to reveal a similar pattern on her chest. She turns to leave the basement and utters a command in a foreign language, which prompts two men to grab Dom and bring him to the upper floor of the cabin. A younger woman enters the basement and explains that preparations are being made for sacrifice. Some time later, Dom is escorted back to the basement, beaten and bloodied, but still alive. He explains to Luke that he will serve as a human sacrifice to the creature, and instructs him to find a way to escape and destroy the village.Dom is taken outside of the cabin and brought to a wooden post, where his hands are tied behind his back. As day shifts to night, a roar can be heard from the forest. The captors immediately fall to their knees in worship. Dom has a vision of his wife emerging from the trees and holding his face in her hands. This is in reality the creature that has been pursuing the men, and it bears a resemblance to the wooden effigy they discovered in the abandoned cabin. The creature removes Dom from the post and impales him on the branches of a nearby tree, leaving him to die. Desperate to escape, Luke breaks from one of his restraints by breaking his thumb, but cannot undo the second one before he is interrupted by the young woman's sudden entrance. When Luke asks about the creature, she explains that it is called a Jötunn, a god-like figure stemming from Scandinavian mythology, and that they provide it sacrifices in return for immortality. She states that Luke will take part in a ritual where he will submit to the creature and join the cult, or be killed.After she leaves, Luke breaks free from his restraints and leaves the basement. He ventures to the upper floor of the cabin, hearing prayers and screaming coming from behind a closed door. Armed with a burning torch, he opens the door and finds a twisted congregation of mummified, but still living humans, evidently the end result of the immortality granted by their worship of the creature. Following Dom's last wish, he sets the worshipers alight. This act attracts the Jötunn, who emerges from the forest to find the cabin burning. In a rage, the creature kills the remaining worshipers. Luke uses this opportunity to escape from the burning cabin undetected, armed with a rifle and an ax. Before running into the woods, Luke aims and takes a shot at the creature as it is about to kill a worshiper. The creature pursues him, attempting to cripple his mind by causing hallucinations of his recurring nightmare. The creature eventually catches him, and forces him onto his knees multiple times, offering Luke a chance to submit. He uses an ax which he had previously taken from one of the worshipers to strike the creature on its head. He then follows the sunlight, emerging from the forest into an open field. The creature does not emerge from the treeline, as it seems unable to follow. The monster roars at him, and he screams back in triumph. Luke turns from the monster and heads in the direction of a paved road with a passing car, a sign of civilization."

Wilf decides to convince Henry to help him murder his mother in order to prevent losing his land and his son, holding Henry's girlfriend Shannon (Kaitlyn Bernard), with whose relationship Arlette opposes, at stake. Henry reluctantly agrees to assist his father in carrying out the murder.Wilf pretends to agree to the sale, appeasing Arlette. As she celebrates, she becomes inebriated.

However, Sheriff Jones (Brian d'Arcy James) is suspicious following her sudden disappearance.

Later, an unidentified woman's body is found on the side of the road which the sheriff assumes is Arlette.

What Happened to Monday,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536537/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In a world where families are limited to one child due to overpopulation, a set of identical septuplets must avoid being put to a long sleep by the government and dangerous infighting while investigating the disappearance of one of their own. In a not so distant future, where overpopulation and famine have forced governments to undertake a drastic One-Child Policy, seven identical sisters (all of them portrayed by Noomi Rapace) live a hide-and-seek existence pursued by the Child Allocation Bureau. The Bureau, directed by the fierce Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), enforces a strict family-planning agenda that the sisters outwit by taking turns assuming the identity of one person: Karen Settman. Taught by their grandfather (Willem Dafoe) who raised and named them - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday - each can go outside once a week as their common identity, but are only free to be themselves in the prison of their own apartment. That is until, one day, Monday does not come home. The year is 2073, where overpopulation, limited fossil fuels and global food shortage have led to the biggest crisis in human history and the enforcement of the strict mandatory one-child-per-family policy, called the ""Child Allocation Act"". Under those circumstances, the ruthless political activist Nicolette Cayman promises a bright future in a brave new world, while at the same time, Terrence Settman decides to get around the government's decree, in a desperate attempt to hide his septuplet grandchildren. As a result, the siblings named after each day of the week will inevitably take turns as Karen Settman, named after their late mother, going out in the world only on the corresponding days of the week, sharing information with the rest of the sisterhood every night. And then, one day, something happens to Monday.—Nick Riganas In a far and not so bright future when population boom leads to a shortage of food, water, and dwelling the government legislate on a one-child policy. At this tough time, identical septuplets (7 children born at the same time) are born and kept hidden by their grandfather. Lost their mother giving birth, and named after the days of the week, they're now trained to act like one person to keep their secret from the guards who are everywhere and check everyone at each corner of the streets. What happens to Monday brings on a lot of trouble to her siblings. In the year 2073 where the world's biggest problem is overpopulation due to genetically modified food, increasing the birthrate of twins, triplets, etc. Due to the world's population rapidly increasing day by day, the government decides to create a strict one-child policy. All siblings will be put to sleep using technology called cryosleep, hoping the siblings will wake up to a better world, a utopia. A group of identical septuplets ( played by Noomi Rapace ) go into to hiding, each sibling is named after a day of the week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each take turns assuming the single identity of Karen Settman, putting on an act as an only child, only to express their true selves at home. Only one child can go outside, according to the day they were named after. That is until Monday doesn't come home. In 2073, overpopulation causes a worldwide crisis, resulting in a strict one-child policy enforced by the Child Allocation Bureau. When multiple children are born to one mother, all but the eldest are put into cryosleep. Karen Settman dies when she gives birth to identical stippled sisters. Their grandfather Terrence names them after the days of the week and trains them to pose as a single individual named after their mother. To safeguard their secret, Terrence ensures they share information at a meeting on a daily basis and replicates any accident that affects one of the sisters' physical appearance. The sisters develop a system of wigs and makeup to cover any identifying features. Terrence reminds them of the importance of going out only one at a time, and that what happens to one of them must happen to all of them. When Thursday breaks the rules by going out on a day that isn't hers, she injures one of her fingers, severing it at the first knuckle. A disappointed Terrence is forced to remove the same portion of finger from all the girls to maintain a single appearance, starting with Monday.Decades later, the sisters have all managed to survive without suspicion. As Sunday returns from her job at a bank, she sees C.A.B. agents detain a child as onlookers protest. The siblings watch the recorded incident and debate turning themselves in, particularly Thursday, who wonders if being put into cryosleep would be so bad; she wouldn't mind being woken up even a hundred years in the future if it means being able to be her own person in public and find a romantic partner. Others, like Saturday, are upset at the thought of being separated, and the responsible eldest sister, Monday, insists on the importance of working together as a unit. After Monday's admonishment, everyone agrees to continue their act. The following day, Monday prepares her disguise as Karen, nervous about giving a presentation. At a checkpoint, Monday runs into Adrian Knowles, a C.A.B. agent who flirts with her. At the bank, Monday's co-worker Jerry, a competitor for a promotion, hints at blackmailing her.The day wears on, but Monday doesn't return home. This worries the rest of the sisters, who know that Monday is the most responsible and has never missed a meeting. Tuesday retraces her steps the next day. Tuesday learns Monday got the promotion and met Jerry at a bar. Before she can investigate further, C.A.B. agents detain her and cut off her communications. Adrian sees Tuesday being escorted to a cell, where she meets Nicolette Cayman, head of the bureau and a candidate for parliament. Cayman explains she knows about Tuesday's siblings, and, when Tuesday offers a bribe, reveals Monday offered the same deal. Cayman orders C.A.B. agents to assassinate Tuesday's sisters as Tuesday is presumably killed.C.A.B. agents use Tuesday's severed eye to bypass a retinal scanner. Thursday ambushes the agents as they arrest the other siblings. The sisters kill the agents, but Sunday dies after being hit by gunfire. Learning the eye is Tuesday's, the sisters suspect Jerry may have sold them out. The next day, Wednesday leaves without disguising herself and confronts Jerry. He reveals the sisters got the promotion when ""Karen"" sent millions of euros to Cayman to fund her campaign. After a C.A.B. sniper kills him, Wednesday kills several C.A.B. agents and flees.As the others remotely guide Wednesday to safety, Adrian shows up at the apartment, concerned about ""Karen"". Thursday convinces Saturday to leave with Adrian, who has had a long-term sexual relationship with one of the sisters. Pretending to be Karen, Saturday loses her virginity by having vigorous sex with Adrian and covertly links their bracelets, allowing Friday to hack into C.A.B. headquarters. On a video feed, they apparently find Monday in a holding cell. Meanwhile, C.A.B. agents corner and kill Wednesday after the latter makes a desperate leap across the rooftops. After Adrian leaves his apartment, C.A.B. agents kill Saturday after she reveals that Monday was the one dating Adrian. Reasoning that she can not survive on her own, When C.A.B. agents storm the apartment, Friday sacrifices herself to give Thursday a chance to escape and save Monday, and she blows up the apartment.Adrian hears about the incident and, distraught, rushes to the apartment. Thursday takes him hostage and accuses him of selling Monday out, blaming him for the deaths of her sisters. He is at first confused but claims to love Monday after realizing they are siblings. Realizing that he is innocent, Thursday convinces Adrian to help by telling him Monday is still alive. Adrian sneaks Thursday into C.A.B. headquarters in a body bag. As she is prepared for disposal, a child undergoes cryosleep. Instead of being frozen, it is incinerated, which Thursday records. After overpowering the guards, Adrian and Thursday discover that Tuesday is alive, only missing her eye. When Thursday asks Tuesday what happened to Monday, it is revealed that Monday indeed bribed Cayman with a massive campaign donation - to get rid of her other sisters and take on the identity for herself.Thursday confronts Monday in the bathroom. Monday retorts that she was always the best Karen Settman, and deserved to have the life for her own; her sisters were just ""afterbirth."" Monday resented the other sisters for not being as responsible as her, especially Thursday, whose carelessness cost everyone part of a finger. After a scuffle, Thursday shoots Monday and leaves her for dead. As Cayman hosts a fundraiser, Tuesday and Adrian broadcast Thursday's video footage. The crowd turns on Cayman, who insists she only did what was necessary. Monday staggers into the fundraiser, but a C.A.B. agent shoots her before she can kill Cayman. As the crowd flees, Monday reveals to the others that she was pregnant and pleads with Thursday to take care of her children as she dies. In the aftermath, the Child Allocation Act is repealed and Cayman faces the death penalty. Thursday, Adrian, and Tuesday watch Monday's and Adrian's twins develop in an artificial womb. Tuesday and Thursday rename themselves Terry and Karen, respectively."
Cult of Chucky,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3280262/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Chucky returns to terrorize his human victim, Nica. Meanwhile, the killer doll has some scores to settle with his old enemies, with the help of his former wife. After accused of murdering her family, Nica is taken to an asylum and thinks that she's the cause of the deaths of her family. However, when grisly deaths start to occur, she then realizes that Chucky, her illusion might not be make believe. She also finds out that the doll is slowly starting to possess anyone or anything to join a huge cult to kill off Chucky's victims, but things don't go to well in the asylum, including for Chucky's long lost friend, Andy, who tries to stop the cult from getting bigger while also trying to get past Chucky's wife, ""Tiffany."" The story takes place four years aft the previous part. Nica is transferred to a low security institution aft the completion of her therapy n her accepting that Chucky was a manifestation of her psychosis n that she murdered her family. Nica's doc gets a doll for the group therapy, another doll is brought to the institution by the guardian of Nica's niece n a third one is couriered to the doc by an anonymous fella.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com The previous 'Child's Play' film ended with Nica being arrested for Chucky killing her family; Nica's niece Alice in Chucky's clutches; Tiffany (still possessing the body of actress Jennifer Tilly) subsequently mailing Chucky to a now-adult Andy Barclay (the protagonist in the first three films); and Andy shooting Chucky when the package arrives.Jumping ahead a few years, Andy (Alex Vincent) is on a date. His date looked up his past online and, creeped out by it, leaves early. Andy returns home and, from a safe, removes the decapitated but still alive head of Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif). This is the scar-headed version from Bride through Curse of Chucky (Scar-Chucky). The pair banter for a bit, and then Andy takes out a blow torch and begins torturing his nemesis with it.Meanwhile, Nica (Fiona Dourif) is receiving electro-shock therapy in a mental hospital. She was deemed insane and committed after trial for the events in the first film. She speaks with her psychologist, Dr. Foley (Michael Terriault). Dr. Foley notes that Nica has made a lot of progress in recognizing that she, not Chucky, killed her family. He has her transferred to a low-security institution. There, she meets fellow inmates Malcolm (who suffers from multiple personality disorder), Angela (schizophrenia), Madeleine (murdered her child), and Claire (anger issues and pyromania). Things go well at first. She and Malcom have sex and she begins group therapy. At one group session, Dr. Foley brings out a ""Good Guy"" doll he bought from Hot Topic. Nica looks shaken, but claims the doll is not real. Angela says Chucky called her on the phone and said he was going to murder them all. Madeleine then adopts the doll as her new ""baby"" (Baby-Chucky). Later that day, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) shows up to speak with Nica. She states that she was Alice's guardian until Alice's recent death... of a broken heart. Nica is devastated to learn that Alice is dead and blames herself. Tiffany then leaves Nica with another Good Guy doll that Alice allegedly used during therapy.That night, one of the Chucky dolls (it is not revealed which one) steals a scalpel and walks down the hallway to Nica's room. He sees Angela, who believes she is hallucinating (Chucky also admits he had called Angela on the phone). Chucky promises to kill her next. Chucky enters Nica's room... and sees blood pooling on the floor. Chucky realizes Nica ripped one of the spokes off her wheelchair and slit her writs out of guilt over what happened to Alice. Nica awakens the next day to see her arm sewn up (in a manner similar to Scar-Chucky's face) and Chucky having written ""not so fast"" in the pool of blood. Nica then hears screaming and sees that Chucky had slit Angela's wrist with the wheelchair wire and killed her instead.At group therapy, Nica immediately drops the act and begins arguing that Chucky murdered Angela. To prove that Chucky isn't real, Dr. Foley uses a lighter to melt the hand of the Chucky doll given to her by Tiffany into a shape resembling a claw (Claw-Chucky). Presumably, were Chucky alive, he would have screamed in pain. When Nica demands he do the same thing to Baby-Chucky, Madeine flees the room with her ""baby."" Malcolm believes Nica and the pair begin following Madeleine. Malcolm goes outside where Madeleine fled to confront her. Watching from the window as there is no handicap access to the backyard, Nica sees Baby-Chucky move and flip her off. During a confrontation, Baby-Chucky and Malcolm fall into an open grave (apparently, the institution buries patients like Angela on-site). When they emerge, Malcolm gives Nica an evil smile and begins referring to himself as ""Charles"" (Chucky's human name had been Charles Lee Ray). This hints at the idea that Chucky is now possessing Malcolm. Meanwhile, Claire goes to throw Claw-Chucky in the trash when he comes to life and bites her. She freaks out and Dr. Foley and an orderly forcibly strap her to a bed before leaving the room to attend to another emergency. Claw-Chucky kills Claire by shooting an oxygen tank through the skylight above her, with the falling glass impaling and decapitating Claire.Andy hears of the murders, grabs a Chucky doll he had given a military haircut to (referencing the events of Child's Play 3), and begins driving to the institution. He receives a call from Tiffany (who admits she is still in Jennifer Tilly's body - i.e., the actress Jennifer Tilly is a character in this series) who taunts him. She also references there are ""three of them"" in a cult.Dr. Foley wheels Nica into his office where he hypnotizes her. Once she is hypnotized, it becomes clear that Dr. Foley has done this before and uses these opportunities to brainwash and rape Nica. He tells Nica that she is responsible for the deaths of Angela and Claire. He begins to kiss Nica when one of the Chuckys smashes him on the head with a glass bottle. Chucky admits that he doesn't know whether to kill Dr. Foley or commend him for being so twisted. He tries to convince Nica to kill Dr. Foley, but she doesn't. She then has a dream where she is taunted by Alice and attacked by a giant-sized Chucky. When Nica awakens, Dr. Foley claims that Nica was the one who attacked him.A little later, Dr. Foley receives the military haircut Good Guy doll (haircut-Chucky) in the mail. Andy shows up and demands to be committed, fighting the guards until they lock him in a rubber room. Madeleine seemingly has a breakthrough with the Baby Chucky and they bury the doll in the cemetery. Unsure how she will react having acknowledged that she killed her real child, Dr. Foley puts Madeleine on suicide watch. But Baby Chucky arises from his grave, crawls in through Madeleine's window, and kills her (with her consent) by ripping out her tongue. He then makes it look like a suicide. Dr. Foley returns to his office to find Nica there (she had been drugged by Claw-Chucky). Dr. Foley tells her he is going to pin the new deaths on her and write a book on her murders. He then puts Nica in high heels (he has a foot fetish) and begins molesting her when he is again knocked out by both Chucky dolls. Claw-Chucky explains that he learned a new voodoo spell that allows him to split his soul across multiple bodies. Chucky explains that he successfully possessed Alice and went on a killing spree in Alice's body. But one of Alice's victims fought back and killed her, thus forcing him back into the doll bodies. The two Chuckies then bring haircut-Chucky to life. The trio kill an orderly that walked in on them. Meanwhile, Tiffany pulls up outside the institution and slits the guard's throat. We see she has the doll her soul used to inhabit in the back seat.The Chuckys come up with a plan. Baby-Chucky goes off to tie up loose ends (killing a nurse and, eventually, Malcolm, who had never actually been possessed). Claw-Chucky successfully possesses Nica and in so doing, is able to allow her to walk again. Nica/Chucky gets out of her wheelchair and stomps Dr. Foley's head in with her high heels. Haircut-Chucky tries to kill Andy, but is overpowered by him. Andy rips open Haircut-Chucky's stomach and pulls out a gun he had hidden inside (he mailed the doll to Dr. Foley to smuggle the weapon inside the institution). Andy and Haircut-Chucky fight and Andy shoots the doll to death. Andy turns around and sees Nica/Chucky standing in the doorway. Nica/Chucky taunts Andy, saying he doesn't have the guts to sacrifice Nica to kill him. Andy does have the guts and tries to shoot Nica/Chucky, but is out of bullets. Nica/Chucky locks Andy into the rubber room (ostensibly the police will pin all the murders on Andy as he is the only one left alive and is in a cell with a gun and a bloody Chucky doll corpse). Nica/Chucky walks out of the institution as Baby-Chucky stays behind to keep an eye on Andy.Nica/Chucky walks up to Tiffany's car and the two make out. They get into the car, where Tiffany says she misses Alice. The two then burst into laughter at that comment... as does the Tiffany doll sitting in the back seat (this suggests that Tiffany may have also split her soul between the doll and Jennifer Tilly. It could also mean that the Tiffany doll houses Alice's soul, or perhaps Glen/Glenda's soul(s) as their fates remain unresolved). The three then drive off into the night as the police arrive.In a post-credits scene (in the DVD/Blu ray version only), the front door to Andy's house is opened. Scar-Chucky looks over and exclaims ""Kyle!"" (Christine Elise - Andy's foster sister from the second Chucky film). Kyle walks in and begins torturing the head of Scar-Chucky (and ostensibly, is the last hope for defeating the now-victorious cult of Chucky)."

On the ride back to the precinct, Serling pukes in the back of the car before starting to speak Orkish to Jakoby, saying he has a message from an organization called the Shield of Light, telling him to ""remember the old ways"", and how a prophecy has chosen him, and that Ward is blessed.Ward is later approached by Captain Perez (Andrea Navedo), along with two men - Yamahara (Kenneth Choi) and Arkashian (Bobby Naderi) - who order Ward to record Jakoby admitting that he let Ward's shooter get away.Serling is interrogated by an elf FBI agent, Kandomere (Edgar Ramirez), and his partner Montehugh (Happy Anderson). The agents ask Serling what he knows about two elf sisters - Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and Tikka (Lucy Fry). Serling knows that Leilah is a dark elf, part of the Inferni clan that wants to resurrect the Dark Lord, an evil entity that was defeated 2,000 years earlier by the Nine Armies. Leilah and her minions want to bring him back to unleash darkness upon the world with the use of three magic wands. Leilah is a ""Bright"", meaning she can wield a wand without it destroying her. Montehugh says they need to find Tikka in order to set a trap for Leilah.On the night patrol, Ward tries to get Jakoby to confess to the incident, when they are alerted to something going on at a house on Abrams Street. They arrive and are shot at by an unseen assailant. After a shootout, the officers kill the assailant. They head inside the house and find dead bodies, including a few that look like they were burnt alive. The officers find Tikka, who is in possession of the wand.Ward calls in Ching and the other cops in regards to the wand. They want the wand for themselves, and they order Ward to go along with it and kill Jakoby, or he dies as well. Ward goes outside to do the job, but first he presses Jakoby at gunpoint on what really happened when he got shot. Jakoby admits he did let the shooter get away, but it was because he lost him in a crowd. He thought he cornered the guy in an alley, but it was just a young orc spray-painting the side of a building. Knowing that the human officers would kill the kid on the spot, Jakoby let him get away on a fire escape. Moments later, Ching and the officers step outside. Ward spins around quickly and shoots them all dead, but Pollard is the only one hanging on for his life. Jakoby attempts to arrest Ward until they are approached by a gang led by wheelchair-bound Poison (Enrique Murciano), who knows about the wand and wants it for himself so that he can walk again. Ward and Jakoby take Tikka and head into their van as the gangsters start attacking.The officers drive away as the gangsters pursue them. The gangsters shoot at them, but Ward and Jakoby are able to shake most of them off. They find a place to hide briefly until more gangsters come after them. One of them finds the wand and tries to grab it, but it causes him to explode and kill those around him.Leilah and her minions arrive at the Abrams house and find Pollard dying before Leilah finishes the job. She then finds another Inferni elf, Larika (Nadia Grey), who is stuck to the walls. She tells Leilah that Tikka got away with the wand, and she slashes Larika's throat. The elves then come across a family that they kill for more information on the wand's whereabouts. Kandomere and Montehugh later come upon the crime scene at the Abrams house, and Kandomere knows Leilah has lost the wand, making her vulnerable.Ward, Jakoby, and Tikka walk through a sleazy orc/human strip club. Poison and his gang find them and once again threaten them for the wand, but Leilah and her minions show up and slaughter Poison and his gang. Another shootout happens, forcing the trio to run again. They run into a nearby convenience store where they find a place to hide. While tending to their wounds in a bathroom, Ward and Jakoby discuss their relationship. Although Ward doesn't think of them as friends, he does tell Jakoby that he shouldn't want to be like him, despite Jakoby previously stating he wishes he were because he sees Ward as fearless.Rodriguez shows up to the store after hearing about Ward killing the officers. He orders Ward to cuff Jakoby since everyone suspects him anyway, and Jakoby willingly relents. Rodriguez is then shot dead as the elves drive up and crash through the store, shooting at the cops. The trio fight back, shooting at the elves before getting away.The trio are then found by a group of orc gangsters belonging to the Fogteeth clan. After Ward mocks them, they get beaten and dragged to a church that serves as their lair. The orcs bring them to their leader, Dorghu (Brad William Henke). He wants the wand as well, and he mocks Jakoby for being unblooded (accepted by the other orcs as one of their own). After the cops refuse to give up the wand, Dorghu orders them to be executed. The guards drag Ward and Jakoby to a pit, and Dorghu orders his son Mikey (Brandon Larracuente) to execute Jakoby. However, Mikey can't bring himself to do so, because he is the young orc that Jakoby let get away. Dorghu allows Mikey to go home, and Dorghu shoots Jakoby, letting his body fall into the pit. Tikka then pulls out the wand and uses it to resurrect Jakoby and raise his body up. The other orcs are astonished and kneel before Jakoby, believing him to be the one the prophecy spoke of. The three then leave.Tikka then speaks English for the first time, now that she knows she can trust Ward and Jakoby. She explains that she took the wand because she knew Leilah wanted to bring back the Dark Lord, and she had sent Larika to kill her, but Tikka took the wand herself. The use of the wand took a toll on her, and it's starting to kill her. She tells them that the Shield of Light can help them if they take her to a pool back at the Abrams house.Ward and Jakoby bring Leilah back to the house. Leilah and the other dark elves show up and battle the cops. Ward and Jakoby manage to kill the elves, and Jakoby appears to shoot Leilah dead. They then take Tikka to the pool beneath a tree, but Leilah emerges, still alive. When she tries to get the wand, Ward grabs it himself. It starts to glow, and he doesn't explode, meaning he is a Bright. Tikka tells him a war word to cast a spell, which Ward repeats, causing the wand to blast Leilah to smithereens. Outside, authorities arrive just as they witness the explosion. Ward and Jakoby look for Tikka, but she's gone.The officers are in the hospital and are approached by Kandomere and Montehugh. Although Jakoby tries to explain everything that happened, Ward denies that there was ever a wand, and that gangsters killed the corrupt officers.In the final scene, Ward and Jakoby are commemorated for their heroism. Pollard, Brown, Hicks, and Ching are also honored alongside Rodriguez, with Ward expressing his hatred for that fact. Jakoby tells him to let it go, since at least they know the truth. Sherri and Sophia are there to support Ward, while he and Jakoby notice Tikka walking among the crowd, smiling at them."

Okja,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3967856/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young girl risks everything to prevent a powerful, multinational company from kidnapping her best friend - a fascinating beast named Okja. For 10 idyllic years, young Mija (An Seo Hyun) has been caretaker and constant companion to Okja-a massive animal and an even bigger friend-at her home in the mountains of South Korea. But that changes when a family-owned multinational conglomerate Mirando Corporation takes Okja for themselves and transports her to New York, where image obsessed and self-promoting CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has big plans for Mija's dearest friend. With no particular plan but single-minded in intent, Mija sets out on a rescue mission, but her already daunting journey quickly becomes more complicated when she crosses paths with disparate groups of capitalists, demonstrators and consumers, each battling to control the fate of Okja...while all Mija wants to do is bring her friend home. Deftly blending genres, humor, poignancy and drama, Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, The Host) begins with the gentlest of premises-the bond between man and animal-and ultimately creates a distinct and layered vision of the world that addresses the animal inside us all. Okja is a Plan B Entertainment, Lewis Pictures and Kate Street Picture Company production in association with Netflix.—Netflix In 2007, self-styled 'environmentalist' Lucy Mirando becomes CEO of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her twin sister Nancy. She announces that they have been breeding a special kind of ""super pig"". The twenty-six produced specimens are sent to farmers in different locations around the world, and ten years later, one of them will be crowned the winner of a competition to breed the best pig. In 2017, a young girl named Mija lives in South Korea with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to New York City. Mija's grandfather presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that he saved up money to buy the solid gold item to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija runs away to Seoul to find Okja, where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In the resulting chaos, Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. Jay uses another ALF member, K, as a translator to tell Mija that they plan to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be re-captured by the Mirando corporation to show how they mistreat their animals. Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but K tells the group that Mija is in agreement with their plan. They abandon her, and Okja is recaptured.. Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has just taken over her family's worldwide company from her twin sister, Nancy (also Tilda Swinton). The company was previously run by their father, who was a terrible man according to everyone whenever he is mentioned. Lucy wants to erase this image that her father and sister have created fro their company, and replace it with an image that cares for all men and animals. At her first press conference, Lucy announces a new project that will revolutionize the food industry as we know it. Mirando, her company, has found a new breed of a natural born super pig and has naturally bred it to give birth to 26 different piglets. The plan is to send each piglet to a farm in every country and have farmers raise the pig by their own natural means. She adds that this will be a competition to see who can raise the very best super pig, which will be unveiled at their grand opening. When asked how long this project will take, she answers that it will take 10 years. She says that it will be worth it because they want the pig to ""taste f***king good"".10 years later, in Korea, we see a 14-year-old girl, Mija (Seo-Hyun Ahn), with a giant super pig whom she calls Okja. Okja is roughly the size of an elephant and looks like one too, if not for its hippopotamus-like snout. She is also very strong and can roll down a hill into a tree without getting hurt. Mija lives alone with her grandfather on top of a mountain farm ever since her parents died. Mija loves Okja like family and takes good care of her and plays with her in the mountains where they live. The pair pick fruit together (Okja's favorite) and catch fish. Mija also whispers secrets into Okja's giant, floppy ears. When Mija's grandfather calls them home, Mija accidentally slips and nearly falls off a cliff, if not for Okja quickly catching the end of her rope. With amazing ingenuity, Okja rangles Mija back up, saving her life. Mija responds by hugging Okja. That night, while Mija and her grandfather eat dinner, her grandfather mentions that Mr. Mundo, Mirando's representative that checks in on Okja's growth, will be coming the next day. Mija asks if her grandfather paid Mundo the money so they can keep Okja and her grandfather says he did. Mija goes to sleep in Okja's massive arms.The next day, Mundo arrives with the renowned and television famous zoologist, Dr. Johnny Wilcox (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is there to examine Okja in order to determine if she will win the contest. Upon arriving, Mundo asks Mija to fetch Okja's black box, a small device that is attached to her ear which monitors her health. Wilcox is loud, obnoxious and is not happy about climbing a mountain in order to reach the pig, but is speechless upon seeing Okja. He barks orders for his crew to start filming as he proclaims that Okja is definitely the winner and will go on to New York City to be unveiled for the contest. Mija and her grandfather don't speak English and can't understand what he's saying, but Mija understands ""New York"". After talking with Mundo, Mija's grandfather takes Mija to see her parents' graves while the crew runs a few tests and examinations. While there, Mija's grandfather gives her a small golden pig made of real gold and reminisces about how in the old days, elders gave a golden pig to girls who were getting married. He gives her the pig as a sign that she is growing up and should stop playing with a pig in the mountains every day. Mija asks him what's going on and her grandfather admits that the people have come to take Okja away and he was hoping that she would be happy with the golden pig. He explains that Okja will spend the night in Seoul before boarding a plane to America for the contest. When Mija asks about the money he used to buy Okja, her grandfather explains that Mirando wouldn't sell them the pig, so he used the money to buy a golden one instead. Mija is angered by this and runs away. Later that night, she packs a few small items, the golden pig, and Okja's fruits into a fanny pack, along with every coin she has saved in her piggy bank and tells her grandfather she's going to Seoul. Her grandfather tries to stop her and tells her that Okja's fate is to be killed and eaten, but Mija doesn't budge.Mija takes buses and subways until she finally gets to the Mirando company building stationed in Seoul. She knocks on a big glass door and asks an obnoxious receptionist to see Mundo, bu the receptionist just calls security to send someone up to escort Mija away. Determined, Mija breaks through the glass door and runs through the office building as security chases her. She finds plenty of pictures of Okja, but not Mundo. She looks outside and sees them loading Okja into a truck. Mundo takes a few pictures with Okja and has her strapped in with a few animal handlers. Okja clearly does not want to go. Mundo gets into the truck's cab with a young driver who doesn't like his job and is annoyed at Mundo's peppiness. As they drive away, Mija comes up close behind. Amazingly, she runs at pace with the truck and climbs aboard banging on the walls so Okja can hear her.Okja does and wails loudly. Suddenly, another truck drives up alongside Mirando's truck. The driver of the second truck and passenger are wearing ski masks. They cheeringly tell Mundo and the Mirando driver that they're not terrorists and hate violence and ask them to stop. When the message doesn't get across, the two men sigh and slam their truck into Mirando's stopping it and knocking Mija off. They exit their truck along with other people in masks as they open the doors to Okja and disarm the handlers. Once they break Okja out of her chains, she goes wild and rampant as the masked crew tries to calm her down. While this is happening, their leader sprays words onto the front of Mirando's truck. Suddenly Mija calls out to Okja and they run to each other and escape. The masked leader sees Mija and tells his crew to get in the truck and follow them. Mundo is upset, but the truck driver is laughing because ""Mirando f***ked up, not him"". Mundo orders the handlers after Okja and the chase begins. Mija leads a panicked Okja through a shopping mall in an effort to evade the police and Mundo. After crashing into a store, the masked men come in and defend Okja from the police.They pick up Mija, who is badly injured, and explain to her that they're the good guys with A.L.F. (Animal Liberation Front), an animal rights group that have been organizing attacks against food companies and slaughterhouses like Mirando for 40 years and hate violence. They all run with Okja into their truck as they escape the authorities.) As the truck drives, Mija sits with Okja as the thieves wonder what to do with her because she doesn't fit in with their plan. Their leader steps forward and takes off his mask and introduces himself as Jay (Paul Dano). His fellow members do the same and introduce themselves. K, (Steven Yeun) a Korean who acts as Mija's translator, Blond (Daniel Henshall), a big wisecracking man, Red (Lily Collins), a snarky woman, and Silver (Devon Bostick), a man who is so devoted to nature that he refuses to eat because it will leave a carbon footprint, which ends up making him sick most of the time. Mija introduces herself and Okja through K's translation.When asked how long she's been with Okja, Mija tells them since she was 4 years old, making it all of Okja's life. Touched, Jay decides to explain to her that Mirando lied when they said Okja and her mother were born naturally when they really were from a petri dish in New Jersey. He takes out a black box, similar to the one on Okja's ear, and tells her it's really a camera so they could switch it with Okja's black box and reveal to the world what really happens in the factories that Okja is going to. The contest is just a publicity stunt while all of the pigs, way more than just 26, are to be processed and chopped up to be sold worldwide. Knowing how dangerous this mission is and how much Mija cares for Okja, Jay asks her for permission to use Okja for the mission. The rest of the crew is dismayed when they hear this because it will be all of their hard work down the drain, but Jay is adamant because Mija is Okja's family. They relent and K asks her in Korean if she will let them take Okja for the mission. Mija says no, but K doesn't want to abort because they're so close and lies and tells them she said yes. Jay and the crew are ecstatic and hug her, telling her it's for a good cause. They switch out the black box and open the doors to the moving truck as it passes over water and jump out. K, who feels slightly guilty, quickly tells her to learn English before leaving Mija with Okja as the police move in.Back in New York, Lucy is not happy about the YouTube videos showing Mija and Okja running through the shopping district. Her board of directors and family lawyer, Frank (Giancarlo Esposito), tell her that it's only a minor setback and shouldn't really disrupt sales. They also mention that the A.L.F. won't be able to touch them in New York because they have beefed up security, and they failed because Mirando has Okja. However, Lucy rewinds the tapes and points at a shot with the police taking away Mija, exclaiming that the image she had worked so hard on to create for the last 10 years. They can't be a good company that loves people and animals if they're seen taking a child away from her pet. Frank calmly suggests the idea of bringing Mija to New York, and Lucy shoots up. She quickly tells her assistants to book Mija tickets, passports, visas and provide her with everything she needs and then some. Mirando will pay for whatever damage Mija caused and welcome her to New York like a hero. Lucy envisions the whole ordeal as touching as they reunite a girl and her pet onstage, like a fairy tale. Lucy says they can even make her the new face of Mirando in their marketing campaign.Dr. Wilcox, who's been listening, gets upset because he was supposed to be the face of the company that everybody loves. Lucy tells him to shut up because his ratings have been suffering and he's a has-been. Wilcox is upset at this, but Lucy doesn't care as she barks orders. Her assistant, Jenny (Shirley Henderson), makes all the arrangements as Mija is released from jail and is prepped to go to America, the company representatives telling her grandfather that she will make them a lot of money, and a lot of photo ops as Korea sends their little farmer princess to New York. Mija, who at this point does not trust anyone and is very angry, constantly demands to speak to Okja on the phone, much to everyone's confusion. Meanwhile, the A.L.F. are following Okja's signal through their black box camera and are getting the video feed. They are all excited that they will soon unveil what really happens behind closed doors. In a darkened room that looks like it was from the set of the Saw movie franchise, a drunk Wilcox has handlers bring Okja in using cattle prods. He is very upset that this pig will be taking away his fame from the company and acknowledges that while Lucy said Okja isn't to be harmed, he won't kill her. As A.L.F. watches, Wilcox brings a bigger super pig into the room to forcibly mate with Okja.As the handlers and Wilcox mistreat the pigs, A.L.F. watches in horror. Red exclaims that they shouldn't have sent Okja there since they knew what was going to happen. Blond tells her they didn't know, but Red tells him they had an idea. When she asks aloud why Mija would have agreed to this, K admits that she didn't. After he explains himself, Jay calmly walks over and punches him, which shocks the group because they don't like violence. Jay tells K that he is now banned from the group and they will return his equipment when they are done. K leaves in shame. Wilcox, meanwhile, is preparing to use a device that extracts meat from cows without killing them, as the phone rings. It's Jenny with Mija who has been demanding to speak to Okja. Hearing her voice, Okja howls and scares Wilcox who smashes the phone in fear. Upset because he too loves animals, or so he says, Wilcox extracts sausage sized meat from Okja to be grilled immediately. Mirando films people eating the meat and loving it.Lucy hears from her sister, Nancy, who is in London. Nancy taunts Lucy for the debacle in Seoul and Lucy taunts her back. Mija, who has taken K's advice and has been learning some English, is getting dressed by Mirando's stylists. Jenny gives her an outfit to wear, but Mija won't do anything until she sees Okja. Annoyed, Jenny tells her that they own the pig and if she plays ball, then she can see Okja. Upset, Mija goes into a room to change, only to find Jay standing there in disguise. By using signs with translations on them, Jay tells her that they're sorry for what they did. He tells her that they are going to free Okja during the ceremony and will take Mija and Okja home. He warns her not to look back at the TV screens since they plan to show everyone what they filmed, and Jay doesn't want to expose all that to Mija, especially after all that she's been through. He tells her that the group loves her and will be with her, giving her hope. Jay slips out the window and makes sure everyone's in position. Lucy receives flowers from Frank as congratulations for running the company for 10 years. Lucy says that she does feel guilty about lying to everyone about where the pigs really come from, but it's for the best since people freak out over genetic mutations. When Frank reveals that Nancy is in town and that the flowers are from her, Lucy gets upset. She made it clear Nancy had to stay away because Nancy scares people since she reminds them of her father.The ceremony starts with Wilcox cheeringly introducing the health the pigs have to offer and little sausages are passed around the rally from the super pigs, which everyone loves. He then introduces Lucy, who takes a few swipes at how her sister ran the company, before introducing Mija onto the stage. Mija doesn't care about any of the celebration as she looks for Okja, whom Lucy announces. A float with a tent comes forward to the stage and Mija steps forward pulling out some of Okja's fruit. Okja's snout comes out and sniffs, but then gets enraged and wails, rushing out and scaring everybody. Mija tries to calm Okja down, but Okja is wild and angry. Red marks are all over her body and her eyes are bloodshot and veiny. Jay gives the word for the video to be played and steps onto the stage in an effort to help Mija control Okja and to keep her eyes away from the screens. The crowd is horrified by the video of Wilcox mistreating Okja and boo and throw things at him. In a restaurant nearby, Frank, who is with Nancy notes the debacle and suggests that Nancy step in, to which she agrees. Okja is still running wild and bites Mija. In anger out of Okja's violence and to save Mija, Jay runs to hit Okja, but Mija stops him. Jay sees that Okja has calmed down and gets his crew ready to move as Okja nuzzles Mija and licks her wounds, literally, as Mija whispers into Okja's ear. Suddenly, the Black Chalk, Mirando's elite security squad rushes in, forcing everyone to flee. Jay and his crew try and lead Mija and Okja away, but get cornered and beaten by the squad. Just when all hope is lost, a truck pulls up and saves the pair. Lying down and bleeding, Jay sees that it is none other than K, who has come back despite Jay's ban. When asked why he shows his tattoo of their credo and rushes them to medical care as they drive to the factory. When Mija awakens and asks where they're going, Jay tells her they're going to get Okja. Lucy, meanwhile, is devastated that her publicity failed as chaos reigns in the streets. Nancy walks up and tells her that she forgot what a loser Lucy was, and remarks that while their father was a terrible man, he was a brilliant businessman. Lucy tells her to have fun cleaning up her mess, to which Nancy replies she can dress up as Lucy and go in front of the press to make a public apology. She tells Frank to start killing the pigs immediately, even Okja.At the factory, Jay tries to hold Mija back from the horrific sight of hundreds of super pigs being corralled by electric fences and cattle prods, but Mija doesn't care. She, Jay and K begin searching for Okja as security rushes to find them, with Black Chalk only minutes away. Mija finally finds Okja as she is being herded into the factory. Mija rushes in to see dead pigs being hung, stripped and ripped in half. She runs up to where a worker kills the super pigs and loads them onto a conveyor belt. As Mija watches in horror, Okja is led towards the worker to be killed. Mija yells for him to stop and produces a picture of her with Okja when they were younger and Okja was no bigger than a pet dog. As the worker stares at the picture, Nancy, Frank, Jay, K and the Black Chalk come in. Jay tries to protect Mija but is apprehended along with K. In English, Mija asks Nancy why she wants to kill Okja. Nancy haughtily tells her that people won't eat pigs unless they're dead and that she owns Okja and can do whatever she wants. As Jay and K are being led away, Jay tells her that while he cares for every living creature, both human and non-human, she is the exception. Nancy doesn't' care and gives the order to kill Okja. Mija cries out for her to wait and produces the golden pig her grandfather gave her. Mija says she wants to buy Okja, alive. Nancy agrees to the deal and tells Frank to arrange safe passage for Mija and Okja to go home. As they are led outside, Mija looks back to hear the killings have continued and all of these pigs will suffer the same fate. She then notices two super pigs struggling to lift the electric fence just enough so their baby can get out. The baby squeals and begins to make a ruckus, and Mija looks to hide the piglet before the guards can see. Quickly, Okja opens her mouth and hides the piglet inside before anyone notices.Back in Seoul, Mija lives in harmony with her grandfather, Okja, and the piglet, who has become an adorable addition to their family. Okja motions to Mija, who puts her ear next to Okja's mouth. Okja whispers and Mija smiles.In America, Jay is released from prison and is greeted by K. On a public bus, K tells him that their numbers have grown and how excited they are about their next job. He introduces their newest member from Seoul, the former Mirando truck driver, who is a gleeful addition and is quite the chatterbox. The former driver sits down next to Red, Blond, and Silver who are also on the bus. K tells him that they are almost at their stop and Mirando will be there too, including Nancy. Jay gives the signal and everyone on the bus puts on ski masks."

When the smoke clears, Bradley is badly hurt and thrown in prison, where his enemies force him to commit acts of violence that turn the place into a savage battleground.—AnonymousB At 6' 5"" and with a prominent crucifix tattooed on the back of his well-shaven scalp, Bradley Thomas--the recovering alcoholic; laid-off tow truck driver, and a soon-to-be father desperate for cash--is a hulking beast one wouldn't want to mess with. Under those circumstances--when the bad decision of resuming his old and well-paying drug-pushing job eventually sends Bradley to prison for seven years--the heavily-indebted to the Mexican cartel inmate will have to face a wrathful ultimatum: Bradley must kill a prisoner to save his kidnapped wife. Now, as Bradley pummels and crushes his way through waves of both convicts and prison guards to get closer to his target, the resolution awaits in the ultimate confrontation inside the confined cell-block 99. However, has the condemned man what it takes to save what's left of his future?—Nick Riganas Former boxer and drug mule Bradley Thomas is laid off from his job at an auto-repair shop. As he arrives home, he sees his wife, Lauren, sitting in her car talking to someone on her cellphone. Bradley approaches her and sees a love bite on her neck. Lauren confesses that she has been seeing somebody else. Bradley orders her inside the house before he violently dismantles her car with his bare hands. When calm, he enters the house to discuss with Lauren their failing relationship. Bradley decides to forgive Lauren and returns to work as a drug mule.Eighteen months later, Bradley and a now pregnant Lauren have relocated to a larger, more expensive home. Bradley's boss, Gil, introduces him to Eleazar, a new business associate, and gives him a new task. Bradley is to sail off the coast with two of Eleazar's men to pick up a package of crystal meth. Bradley does not trust the larger of the two men, Roman, but accepts the job when Gil offers him three months paternity leave. As they arrive at the pier, Bradley senses they are walking into a police trap and dumps his bag into the water. Bradley instructs the other two men to do the same, but they ignore his order and confront the police in a firefight, wounding three officers. After pausing and considering turning away, Bradley instead shoots both Eleazar's men in order to assist the police. The third drug trafficker dies in the shootout. Bradley is taken into custody and sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison.During the night, Lauren is kidnapped by men under orders of Eleazar. On the second day of his incarceration, Bradley is visited by the Placid Man, who informs Bradley that he works for Eleazar. He tells Bradley that, unless Bradley assassinates an inmate named Christopher Bridge, located in Redleaf Correctional Facility, a separate maximum-security prison, the limbs of his unborn child will be surgically removed by an abortionist and sent to him. Bradley reluctantly accepts.Bradley picks a fight with multiple guards, until he is overpowered and transferred to Redleaf. There, he meets unforgiving Warden Tuggs. Bradley is put into a horrible cell, where the toilet is clogged with feces. Eventually, he is able to go outside for yard time. When a fellow inmate informs him that Christopher Bridge is not located in this section of the prison but in another section known as cell block 99, Bradley fights some other inmates and consequently is thrown into cell block 99.Warden Tuggs explains that cell block 99 is where he devises special punishments for society's most despised criminals. Bradley is forced to wear a stun belt that gives him electric shocks at a push of a button, as a punishment for the fight. His cell in block 99 is lined with broken glass and only contains a crude squat toilet hole. Bradley speaks to a man in an adjacent cell, who informs him that Christopher Bridge does not exist at all. During the night, a young brutal guard named Wilson escorts Bradley to another, larger cell in block 99, where Eleazar, Roman, and two other gangsters are located. The gang torture Bradley with the electric belt, and taunt him by threatening to call the abortionist. He is beaten and shocked so badly that he needs to be dragged back to the cell unconscious.Bradley devises a plan and tears the lining out of his shoes: he places the rubber between his body and the belt to prevent the shocks. This enables him to ambush Wilson and another guard; resulting in him killing Wilson. Bradley locks the second guard inside a cell. Bradley confronts Eleazar, and brutally kills all three henchmen in hand-to-hand combat. During the brawl, Eleazar calls the Placid Man and instructs him to activate the abortionist. Bradley first tortures Eleazar by breaking his leg, then calls the Placid Man to negotiate for Lauren's freedom. It is agreed that the Placid Man will deliver Lauren to Gil's house. Bradley drags Eleazar into his own cell, across the broken glass, to await confirmation of Lauren's freedom. Warden Tuggs and his men arrive at block 99, but Bradley threatens to kill his two hostages. Bradley states he is waiting for a phone call, and promises that he will surrender peacefully, exactly one minute after the call ends.The Placid Man and the abortionist follow Eleazar's instructions and drive Lauren unharmed to Gil's house. As they drive away, Gil retrieves a hidden assault rifle and kills the Placid Man. Lauren then takes the rifle and shoots the abortionist. Gil phones Bradley to inform him that his family is finally safe. Bradley speaks to Lauren for the last time, and shares a few words with their unborn child.Bradley destroys the cell phone, then reminds Warden Tuggs that he still has 60 seconds of freedom remaining. Bradley shoves Eleazar's face into the squat hole and stomps several times on his neck, decapitating Eleazar and leaving the head at the bottom of the toilet. Warden Tuggs and his men finally enter the cell. Warden Tuggs orders Bradley to turn around with his hands behind his head. Bradley says ""78 days"" and turns around to face Warden Tuggs and his guards. Bradley gives one last look at Tuggs, who then shoots Bradley twice, once in the chest and once in the head. The screen cuts to black on the third gunshot and Bradley's body hitting the floor is heard."
Time Trap,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4815122/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A professor enters a cave and goes missing. Some of his students come looking for him and get trapped in the cave as well. Hopper (Andrew Wilson), an archaeology professor, is exploring a remote cave system on the trail of missing hippies from the 1970s. Hopper finds the hippies van. After discovering what appears to be a cowboy paused in place in a tunnel, he returns to town and dismisses his graduate students, Taylor (Reiley McClendon) and Jackie (Brianne Howey), stating that their research is done.Hopper enters the cave system from the opening where he found the cowboy. Hopper finds an invisible barrier inside which the air is measurably damp from the outside.Several days later, as Hopper has not returned, Taylor and Jackie go looking for him, with their friend Cara (Cassidy Gifford), who brings her sister, Veeves (Olivia Draguicevich), and her friend Furby (Max Wright). They find the van, which Hopper discovered. From the photos left in the van, Taylor and Jackie find out that the missing hippies were Hopper's parents.Following Hopper's trail to the campsite by a cave, they find an entrance with climbing ropes leading inside. They decide to follow it, but Furby chooses to stay behind as backup for the base camp. They lower themselves into the cave, hearing strange noises & encountering the same invisible barrier as Hopper.As Hopper enters the cave, the cowboy walks away normally, and when Hopper looks out he sees the shadows of sunrise and sunset pass by several times in a matter of seconds.
Hopper comes out of the cave, only to find his jeep overgrown by vegetation, and his dog nowhere to be seen. He finds Taylor and Jackie's car nearby and it seems that it has been there for several years. Hopper goes back into the cave to find Taylor and Jackie.When Furby does not answer their radio calls, Jackie tries to climb back out, but the rope frays, and she falls, injuring herself and Taylor. They think that Fury cut the ropes. Calling for help, they receive a transmission from inside the cave and follow it. The message was ""help me"" in a very faint voice, who claims to be Furby.At a different junction, they discover another opening to the cave and Furby, dead with a broken neck. Watching his video recordings, they notice several days elapsed from his perspective, while only about an hour had lapsed in the cave. He began researching the hippies' belongings, discovering that Hopper is searching for his missing sister (when the sister got sick is when Hopper's parents went about looking for the Fountain of Youth). His parents were following legends of the Fountain of Youth and speculated that this cave system was the root of the story. Furby found another cave opening. After several days, he went into the cave to retrieve keys for a vehicle but fell when his rope severed.Taylor deduces the cave is inside a time distortion where events move more slowly. With few options, Cara free-climbs out of the cave to get a GPS signal. Outside, the terrain has become barren, and there is no signal. There are massive dust-storms and Cara notices something massive orbiting the Earth
Returning to the cave, comparing video recordings, Cara has experienced 30 minutes on the surface while she had been gone only a few seconds from their viewpoint, confirming Taylor's theory. Reviewing Furby's footage again, they learn he survived the fall but was murdered by a caveman. Cara and Taylor deduce the time difference is much more drastic than they suspected and entire years are passing within seconds, meaning the few hours they have been in the cave is enough to span several hundred or thousand years outside.Hearing more howling, Cara prepares to climb out again for help but is interrupted by a futuristic humanoid spaceman descending via a retractable ladder. A caveman suddenly attacks, but is subdued by the caveman non-lethally. They flee just to find a whole tribe of cavemen inspecting the dead bodies of the cowboy and Hopper's parents. Discovered, Taylor fights the cavemen and is killed.
The spaceman returns, protects the others from the cavemen, and then places Taylor into a healing pool of water. More cavemen attack, and the spaceman is fatally wounded, but uses his dying breaths to show them several media clips about their disappearance and indicating that humans have become space-faring.Taylor finds Hopper injured in front of another time dilation, containing his long-missing sister and a legion of conquistadors in battle with the cavemen over control of a waterfall, the source of the time distortion, at the center of the cave system. Hopper explains the field is strongest here, making rescue of his sister impossible; he tells Taylor to go and save the others, as he is also dying. Preparing to leave the cave with the spaceman's ladder, the students are attacked by cavemen before they can get through; Cara is pulled through the portal by future beings before she can help her friends. From their perspective, she reappears through the portal, differently dressed and with rope-like mechanisms which pull her friends through.A short time later, Furby awakens, along with Hopper and Hopper's family, all having been retrieved and resurrected with the healing waters. The others arrive, happily explaining they are in a space station and have a lot to talk about."

Jungle,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3758172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of friends join a guide for a trek into the Bolivian jungle, searching for an Indian village. The men soon realize that the jungle is a difficult place to be. In the pursuit of self-discovery and authentic experiences, Israeli backpacker Yossi Ghinsberg meets a cryptic Austrian geologist in La Paz, Bolivia in 1981. Captivated by his engrossing stories of lost tribes, uncharted adventures, and even gold, Yossi decides to follow him, accompanied by his good friends, American photographer Kevin and Swiss teacher Marcus. Without delay they join an expedition led by their seasoned trail-leader, deep into the impenetrable emerald Amazon rainforest. However, as the endless, inhospitable jungle separates the inexperienced team, before long Yossi will find himself stranded in the depths of a nightmarish environment crawling with formidable and tireless adversaries. How can one escape this green maze?—Nick Riganas In 1981, the Israeli world traveler Yossi meets the backpacker friends Marcus and Kevin in Bolivia. After meeting the Austrian adventurer Karl, Yossi persuades his two new friends to join him on a jungle expedition. The trip provides the group with unique impressions, but when Marcus catches an infection in his sore feet and food supplies run low, Karl insists on stopping the expedition. However, Kevin and Yossi persuade him to continue the journey with a self-built raft. The group almost falls victim to a rapids, after which there is a quarrel and a split-up. Yossi and Kevin join forces to continue their journey on a raft, but crash on a rock. Yossi is swept away by the current and has to face a grueling struggle for survival in the wilderness, which brings him closer to a loss of reality. Kevin is rescued by locals and persuades a ferryman to embark on an uncertain search for his lost friend. This is based on a true story of a group of three friends traveling in South America, Yossi (Israeli), Kevin (American) and Marcus (Swiss) who meet a stranger, Karl (Austrian) who claims to be a unique guide that promises to bring the trio to a lost Indian tribe deep in the Amazon jungle. After a little convincing from Karl, Yossi and his friends decide they will go on this adventure to see this rare site. They take some supplies and plan to restock at a village along the way. On their way to their first stop, things seem to be going rather smoothly. They trek through the jungle led by Karl. and soon they arrive at the village where they planned to stop and restock before continuing on to find the lost tribe. While they are here the young men are each off taking part in their own activities. Kevin is taking photos, Marus is providing some medical care to the locals and Yossi and Karl are enjoying the local customs and culture. The three young men take to the river to clean up and wash from their time in the jungle. They soon realize they are the main attraction of the local village woman, many whom they assume have not seen many white men before, especially nude. The chorus of local woman give a giggle as the boys cover their parts and sheepishly wave.The group says their goodbyes to the villagers and head back into the jungle on their way to see the lost tribe. While hiking through the jungle the group starts to struggle. They are running low on supplies including food so Karl shoots a monkey from a tree it falls to the ground still not dead so he proceeds to beat it to death which disturbs the others in the group. Karl claims he has done it to save bullets. The group sets up camp for the night and Karl serves his recent kill. However, Marcus is disgusted and cannot bring himself to eat any of the meat. This starts to create a ripple in the group. Kevin feels Marcus is too weak for adventures like this but the next morning the group carries on.With the rainy season on its way, Karl wants them all back before this happens, but they still have several days of hiking ahead of them. Pushing on the group endures rainstorms, slogging through the thick jungle, fear of predators while trying to survive on their dwindling supplies. During this time, Marcus' feet start to breakdown and he is struggling to walk and keep up with the others. During one of their stops, Karl gives Marcus some tips on how to care for his feet so they can continue on. Seeing his feet blistered, bloodied and raw, his friends see how bad things are and offer to carry Marus' gear going forward. Still trying to continue forward the group reaches a point where it is near impossible for Marcus to walk. Both Yossi and Kevin offer to carry him the rest of the way. Karl shoots down this idea and proposes that he go on alone and then send back help for them. Kevin does not accept this; he does not want their so-called guide leaving them in the jungle alone with almost no supplies. The group then has the idea to raft down the river they have been following. After arguments from Karl they take a vote, the raft idea wins 3 to 1. Wasting no time the team gets to work on constructing a raft and Karl even carves paddles for them to use to row and steer. While working on the raft Yossi is stung by a fire ant and yells in pain. Karl comes over and informs him that it was only a simple fire ant. He then shares that this species of ant has been used as a method of torture and it had the power to make this being tortured ""see god"".With the raft complete the group reviews their plans one last time and Karl reminds them all that while on the river they must do whatever he says in order to survive. Quickly, they hit a patch of rapids. Karl barks orders for them all to follow but Kevin fights back as he knows that in doing so they will not make it through the rapids. The two get into a small fight before Yossi jumps between them to break the two apart. Once they regain control of the raft they pull ashore where Karl immediately storms off into the jungle. Marcus tries to make Kevin go after him and apologize as he is their guide and the only one how knows where they are. Kevin refuses and tells the other that he can tell Karl has never been on a river in his life - that he can't read the river at all. He even goes a step further saying seeing Karl's eyes while they were in the rapids he believes Karl doesn't know how to swim. Unsure of what to make of the situation Yossi knows someone must go find their guide so he heads into the jungle to find Karl. He soon spots him and Karl shoots almost Yossi who is stunned and scared. Karl says he was just scaring off a jaguar, but that it was gone now. Leery of Karl even more so, the two head back to the river's edge where the party makes camp for the night.The next morning Karl states he will not go back on the river and will take the three-day hike from here. No longer caring about what is tour does he says they can hike with him or go back on the river. Right away Kevin knows he will stick to the river and Yossi, who is still eager for adventure wants to continue on with Kevin, but knows that Marcus will want to come and at this point, he feels that Marcus is too soft and might spoil their adventure. Still, Yossi and Marcus talk about their options. Yossi initially proposes that Marcus must take the raft due to the condition of his feet, but since they cannot let Karl go on alone, Yossi will go with him. Marcus then shares that since they have been able to rest their feet, his own have healed and he would rather walk with Karl. Relieved, Yossi agrees to go with Kevin and for Marus and Karl to continue on foot. Before parting the party reviews the map where Karl highlights important spots on the river the boys will need to be ready for. They split up the supplies they have left, which Karl insisting Kevin and Yossi take more than half as on the river they won't be able to hunt and Karl and Marcus can also restock at the local village they had passed through before. Lastly, before heartfelt goodbyes, they promise to meet back up in at La Paz. The friends say their goodbyes and head off in their own direction.Yossi and Kevin are rafting down the river, enjoying the ride. They conquer their first patch of rapid and are excited and invigorated to continue on. Yossi suggests they pull ashore and make camp for the night but Kevin wants to make use of the daylight and get closer to the section of rapids Karl warned them about. The two causally chat and Kevin asks if Yossi knows what day it is. - he says he thinks it's December 1st. Kevin wonders if he will make it home in time for Christmas. While Yossi is dozing off on the raft suddenly the water becomes rough and the duo realizes they are about to hit the rapids. They attempt to paddle to the small beach Karl told them to stop at but the current is too strong and the boys are unable control the raft. The raft smashes into a boulder in the middle of the river trapping them against the current and rock. Kevin knows he can make it to the riverbank where he can then and then help Yossi to the shore as well. Diving into the current he is lost under the water but soon resurfaces and swims with all his might making it to the rocky bank. Quickly Kevin scrambles to Yossi. He shouts to him telling him to grab the machete before abandoning their raft. Before Yossi can do anything the raft gives way and he is swept away downstream. While being tossed around underwater his head his a rock and he loses consciousness.Yossi wakes up on the riverbank alone. He tries to look around for Kevin and shouts his name but it only echoes in the jungle unanswered. Knowing he must continue on he starts again on his journey, this time alone. After a few days, he stumbles upon his pack. While there's not much in it there are a few key items like his grandfather's lucky charm a small notebook he credits to his survival, the map, and a few other supplies. Also inside is the cocaine Karl had them pack which he takes to search for Kevin but is unable to find him. At night he starts to hear voices, he hears Kevin and Marcus calling to him and he sees Marcus. He points his flashlight at his friend only to realize it was a figment of his imagination. In the night he continues to hear the underbrush rustling and he scans the jungle with his flashlight looking for the cause.
It's a jaguar. With little to defend himself with Yossi improvises taking a lighter and an aerosol can to create a makeshift flamethrower which succeeds in scaring off the jungle cat. During the day time Yossi had previously a bump on his forehead but didn't pay it much mind, but it's starting to bother him and he knows he must take care of it. Taking a set of tweezers and digs into the bump and is able to pull out a long black worm-like parasite and drops it into a tin. Disgusted, he attempts to squeeze out any and all the blood, puss and infection out of this wound before covering it up with gauze. Coming to terms with that fact that he must find help for himself and with the map to guide him, he decides he will push forward alone, but he does leave a redrawn version the map with his plans and a few supplies for Kevin who can only hope is making his way down along the river.Hungry, alone and desperate he continues to go down the river. Knowing he must eat, Yossi musters up the courage to pull a snake from a tree and bludgeon it to death for food. He also scavenges what fruit and other items he can. He ends up coming across a couple of eggs which he cracks open only to realize there is a developing baby bird embryo inside. He hesitates and apologies for what he is able to do and he eats the contents of the egg and tosses the empty blue eggshell aside and pushes forward. At this point, his feet are in terrible condition. He removes his socks and shoes to reveal his feet that look much like Marcus' had during their journey. In excruciating pain, Yossi apologizes to Marcus crying that he had no idea the pain Marcus was enduring before. With visible sores on his feet, he admits that he didn't want to be the weakest in their group, but that he was just as scared as Marcus was. Of course, no one is around he hear him, but he still sobs and suffers claiming he deserves this because of his prior actions toward his friend. While back on the move Yossi comes across a shoe print and starts shouting in search of Kevin who he assumes has left the print and hi nearby looking for Yossi. While frantically scanning the jungle for any signs of his friend he spots the broken blue eggshell he cast aside before. He looks back to the footprint and gently places his own shoe into the track only to realize it's his own print, and he has been wandering around lost in circles. He scolds himself for letting this happen, for not staying by the river where he would have been less likely to get turned around. He starts storming off in search of the river he intends to follow. There is a flashback to Yossi and his parents at the dinner table. His father is disappointed and angry that Yossi will be backpacking for a year and tells him he will give him no money to support him. Yossi admits he does not want any of his father's money and his father storms off.Back in the jungle, Yossi is doing his best to press on at day 14. Thunder starts to roll in and soon he is caught in a torrential downpour. Finding some refuge under a tree, Yossi pulls his grandfather's notebook from his bag and clings to it while trying sleep. He dreams of being a high roller gambling in the 1920s. Served delicious foods in a hotel suite, a beautiful woman joins him as they move to the bed. As the scene starts to progress, Yossi is woken up by water falling onto him and he quickly realizes his chosen spot if flooded and floating away. Scrambling he gets ahold of his gearMeanwhile, a pair of locals comes across something that shocks them. They have found Kevin who has washed up near their village around 120 miles from where Yossi is. The two men help him back to their small fishing village where he is able to get the help he needs. Not long after, Kevin is looking well and he is doing all he can to find Yossi. Most of the locals figure Yossi is dead and that Kevin should give up and go home. However, Kevin refuses to believe them, knowing that Yossi would do all he could to survive. He is able to have a pilot fly him over the area where they think Yossi might be. On the ground, Yossi hears the plane. He tries his best to get the attention of the aircraft by waving come red fabric, but they don't see him. In the plane, Kevin complains to the pilot that they are too high to see anything and asks to fly over again but lower. Instead, the pilot says they must go back. Yossi hears the sound of the plane fade into the distance and collapses in emotional agony knowing he may have missed his one chance at rescue, Back at the village, Kevin pleads with the local authorities to help him look for Yossi, to have better more effective searches. The officer shares his doubts about Yossi being alive since he has now been missing for three weeks. However, Kevin won't take no for answer and says if will die looking for his friend if he must. With sympathy, he is referred to a local man who is said to be his best bet in finding his friend. He goes and speaks with, Tico, the local man who brushes him off saying a gringo could not last for three weeks in the jungle. He tries begging the man to help, but still, he refuses. Switching tactics, Kevin asks Tico how much for his boat. The two laugh but then Kevin reiterates, how much for the boat and the two strike a deal and head out to look for Yossi.During this time Yossi is still fighting for survival in the jungle. After coming across the destroyed village he finds a young native woman alone and scared. She is immediately afraid of him and since they don't speak the same language he does what he can to calm her and assure her that is not going to hurt her. He is simply happy to see another human and shares what little he has with her. He just wants to keep her safe and protect her. After giving her blankets and things to sleep in Yossi does one odd thing and lightly pokes the woman's arm. He assures her that he wanted to make sure she was real and he is satisfied that she is. Over the next few days, the two continue on together towards the river's edge when the rescue plane comes back, they will be easier to spot and be saved. Time passes and the two seem to argue and fight - most of it coming from Yossi who is struggling to walk even with the aid of a stick to support him. At night they lay down to get some sleep under a tree. As the camera pans out the native girl fades away and disappears. She is the gone and Yossi realizes she too was a hallucination.Yossi continues to deteriorate both mentally and physically but still fights on. In his dazed stupor, he stumbles into quicksand bog. Grasping for anything around he tries to pull himself out, but the nearby plants are too weak and break before he makes any progress. He abandons his pack to save his own life but realizes he has forgotten his grandfather's notebook. Neck deep in the quicksand he stretches out his arm attempting to reach the notebook but with his movement, he only sinks deeper into the bog. Recalling his actions he tells himself not to move. Flashing back to when he was with his grandfather before he left for his trip and when his grandfather passed along this small but powerful keepsake. He tells Yossi to come back alive. With this echoing in his mind, he wakes back, in reality, face party way into the bog arms now submerged. Still, he decides to fight. With all his effort, he reaches for a handing leaf above him and starts to pull himself free. He curses at the plant demanding it no break on him. Finally, he is able to belly crawl out of the mud where he soon starts to drift in and out of consciousness. His mind keeps echoing that he must get to the riverbank so the rescue team can see him. In his disillusioned state, Yossi spots small skinny tree covered in fire ants just ahead of him. Dragging himself towards the tree, he recalls the jolting pain from the fire ant sting from before and knows what he must do. After dragging himself to the fire ant-covered sapling and managing to stand up, he starts to remove his shirt. At this moment it is revealed how much weight he has lost during his time lost in the jungle. He has withered to skin and bones; his ribs protrude out from under his skin. Yossi is also filthy, caked in layers of dirt, mud, and grime. He takes a moment to hitch his now loose pants tighter around this thinned out waist with his belt before wrapping both his hands around the fire ant infested tree. Shaking the small sapling, the ants fall from the leaves and branches onto Yossi, covering him. Crawling across Yossi's exposed skin, the ants start to bite and sting him, flooding him with jolt after jolt sending Yossi into an adrenaline and pain fueled final surge. His start to stumble quickly through the jungle, hallucinating as he goes. We see his mother reach out for him, hear a man calling for him, a flash of the native girl he thought was real roar at him. We see the moments other moments from his ordeal dart in and out of his vision, his mind. Still, we hear a man calling to him encouraging him to push on through the other voices, noises, and storms. Breaking through the foliage and tangles of the jungle Yossi tumbles on to the river rocks near the swift-moving river he's been searching for and looks up to see the sky. With the strength he has left he takes logs from nearby and he constructs a simple ""Y"" by the river, settling down between the two upper points with the base almost touching the river's edge. Looking to his side Yossi sees a turtle wondering by at first he sees it as food, grabbing a large rock with intentions to crush the turtle for food. However, he has a change of heart and casts the rock aside and lowers himself down next to the turtle assuring the creature it is okay and it will live. Gazing back up to the sky, Yossi sees the stars and colors in the night sky. His eye well up with tears and he opens himself to the universe it may seem. Out of the sky, a blue butterfly floats down to him and lands on a finger of his our stretched arms and hands. This fleeting moment brings him to tears of joy and he thanks the butterfly as it floats back off into the night.On day 19 we see that Kevin has not given up his search. He and the local, Tico, are still on the river looking for Yossi. The two pull their boat to the riverbank and Tico says they must head back as their small boat cannot continue further upstream against the rapids. He assures Kevin that he has done all that he could in looking for his friend. Begrudgingly and full of disappointment Kevin joins Tico as their lift their boat back into the water. As they do Kevin accidentally kicks a nearby log. As the camera pulls back we see it is the ""Y"" Yossi had previously laid out., but we don't see Yossi. A woman begins to whisper as we see Yossi partly waking up but he swats it away as if he wishes to continue sleeping. The two rescuers have their boat back in the water and Kevin hops into the boat and starts talking to Tico about turning their boat around. Yossi in his exhausted state recognizes Kevin's voice and peaks his head out from behind a tree root where he had spent the night.
Yossi sees the boat with his friend and the local man. They aren't facing him so they have no idea he his there. He tries to call out to Kevin, but it only comes out a whisper. He struggles to get closer to the duo before they are too far down the river. He crawls along the river bank he pulls himself closer to standing, but is it too late; they have started the motor and begin to head back. In desperation, Yossi stands and tries once more to call out. But only a whisper comes out. As Kevin and his compainion are about to turn around the bend in the river Kevin takes one last look to the shore and spots Yossi emaciated, dirty, pale and panting standing there. Kevin immediately shouts to him and Yossi realizes he is saved and crumples to the ground in exhaustion and tears of relief. Tico and Kevin turn around. Kevin rushes to the shore, to his friend who he embraces as Yossi embraces him too. The two men help Yossi into the boat as they head back to the village. Yossi has finally been rescued.As the boat returns to the village, Tico and Kevin help carry Yossi into the village so he can sit and get some water and much-needed aid. The locals are in awe that this young man has survived this whole time, along in the unforgiving jungle. A girl in the villages walks over and give Yossi a flower followed by an older woman in the town who comes and thanks god, as does Yossi. Again, he looks to the sky with a smile. The villagers gather around him and the camera pans up and away from the village to the river and jungle which the two boys had each survived.After fading to black a few lines appear on screen stating that Kevin and Yossi did make it back to La Paz, expecting to reunite with Karl and Marcus, but they were nowhere to be found. Kevin searched for them for weeks but he was unable to find any trace of them. The two were never heard from again. Laster, it was discovered that Karl was wanted by the authorities (Interpol) and had taken other travelers on treks like this before. There was no lost tribe to be found though. No one knows why Karl picked Yossi or why he lead them into the jungle.A few pictures of the real-life people are shown. First is Yossi after he was found; he is skin and bones. Then a picture of Tico, Kevin, and Yossi two days after the rescue. They then show shots of Kevin and Marcus hiking in the Andes, Kevin backpacking in Peru, Marcus volunteering in Bolivia, Kevin and Yoss together in South America. They also have a black and white photo of Karl; date and place are unknown. Lastly, small recent bios for Kevin and Yossi are shown. Kevin is still doing what he loves, photography, and now has a family with a wife and two sons. He also recently wrote his own account of surviving in the jungle. As for Yossi, after 10 years he returned to the same river in the Amazon that almost took his life, and now calls this place home. He worked with locals to transform the area and continues to be an adventurer across the globe. The film ends with a photo of Marcus with the caption ""for Marcus"" ."

Cargo,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3860916/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After an epidemic spreads all over Australia, a father searches for someone willing to protect his daughter. In a world overtaken by a virus that turns people into zombies within 48 hours, husband and wife, Andy and Kay, and their one year old daughter, Rosie, are living safely on a houseboat in rural Australia.While relocating for the night, Andy spots two children playing on the shore of the river. He shouts out to them, but continues the cruise after the father, noticing Andy, flashes a revolver in his belt. Later that day, Andy is using a net to fish supplies out of the water. Kay mentions their food rations are starting to run out, but Andy debates her plans to go on land. The scene changes to one of a young Aboriginal girl attaching leaves to her shoes. It goes back to Andy after a minute, who has spotted an abandoned sailboat, proceeding to investigate it. He retrieves food, and presents it to a skeptical Kay.After reassuring her the sailboat he ransacked was safe, Kay decides to return by herself to try and collect more supplies. Andy had previously left when he heard thuds coming from a door in the wall, but Kay, unaware of this, is presumably attacked by a zombie that emerges from the door.Andy awakens to Rosie crying, and goes in search of Kay. She is in the bathroom of the houseboat, trying to restrain the bloodflow from a bite on her knee. She is next seen investigating a pack that was previously acquired by Andy from the river. In it is contained a bracelet that measures the amount of time left for an infected, which Kay puts on, and an injection that neutralizes the brain, so an infected feels no pain whilst transitioning. Andy and Kay discuss their plans, confirming her vulnerability. The family decides to abandon the houseboat and venture to a hospital. They pass by the burning remnants of a body.Thoomi, the Aboriginal girl, is drawing in a sketchbook. She leaves behind the picture of a man with his head in the ground, then leaves her shelter with a rabbit carcass, which she throws into a pit. Gargling is heard and she covers her ears.Andy and Kay have found a vehicle. While Andy fills the gas tank, Kay notices a yellow slime on the seat back. They narrowly evade a zombie trudging towards them. As they drive away, one is seen struggling to lift its head from the ground. They stop on a deserted stretch of road so Andy can look at a map, and Kay change Rosie's diaper. She collapses offscreen, convulsing and throwing up blood while Andy holds her steady.Thoomi is seen once more throwing a snake carcass into the pit, but no sounds are heard. She climbs down to check, and then exits hastily.Kay comes to her senses and checks her wound in the car to see it is oozing yellow slime. In a fit she exits the car and has a shouting match with Andy, angered he has been trying to keep her developments from her. He subdues her and convinces her to continue with him. Andy breaks the door handle to keep Kay from trying to escape again. On the road, Andy is distracted by a lone man and consequentially crashes the car into a tree, impaling Kay. Andy faints from shock, leaving Rosie strapped in her seat. He comes to hours later and tries to wake Kay, but realizes she has already converted, as evidenced by pus around her eyes and mouth. He is bitten by her while trying to exit the car. Following this, Andy approaches the car, Rosie sitting a distance away safely, and uses one of the injections on Kay. He takes her bracelet and places it on himself instead, then begins travelling on foot with Rosie on his back. She cries for a great part of the journey, until he uses Kay's perfume to calm her. While resting, he spots the man that had caused their crash, but realizing he is a zombie, prepares to defend himself. Thoomi appears to dissuade Andy from hurting the man, her father, and cuts her hand with a rock to draw blood and lead him away.Andy arrives at the town he intended to reach, entering a school and meeting Etta, a retired teacher. She helps him clean his wounds, and informs him that all the Aboriginal people have left the land, including many of her former students. Andy steps outside and sees fires in the distance, started by the Aboriginals. A woman is seen calling for Thoomi. That night, in a hospital room, Andy has his first seizure. He awakens the next morning, going outside to meet Etta, who tells him to seek a man named Willie, Thoomi's father, to take care of Rosie. She explains the purpose of the fires, started by Aboriginal hunting parties that are cleansing the land by killing zombies they encounter. Etta warns Andy to stay out of their range. On his journey Andy stops at some ruins to give Rosie water. He passes several zombies with their heads in the ground, hastily leaving the area, but one rises and proceeds to follow him. He finds a truck and attempts to hijack it, but is stopped by a man named Vic, who saves Andy from the zombie that had been after him, of which Andy was unaware. Vic is trapped under a tank and gives Andy the keys, making him promise to rescue him first, and then they can escape approaching zombies together. Vic takes Andy to his shelter, an outpost formerly part of a gas plant. He meets Vic's wife, Lorraine, who is quietly surprised to see other ""people who are still people"". Vic encourages Andy to leave Rosie with Lorraine so the two men can go to work. Work is shooting groups of zombies and collecting their valuables, as Vic believes when the country returns to normal people will want riches again. Vic attracts the zombies by imprisoning live, healthy humans inside cages as bait. Andy is perturbed to see Thoomi trapped. At the shelter, Lorraine is taking care of Rosie. As the power goes out, Rosie becomes uncomfortable. Lorraine attempts to cheer her up, but discovers slime on her stomach.Vic visits another cage with Andy. He uses entrails, a radio, and blood to lure zombies, all factors which make Andy question himself for a moment. The men return to the shelter, where Lorraine briefly mentions cleaning up Rosie. Andy plays with his daughter before setting her down in a makeshift crib, his hand starting to spasm. He leaves the shelter with an injection, but cannot bring himself to use it. Lorraine comes upon him, confessing she is not Vic's wife, and that Vic let her husband die along with other gas plant workers to save himself. Vic approaches them and knocks Andy out with the butt of his rifle out of suspicion, the latter awakening chained in the same cage as Thoomi. They agree to help each other escape by using the combined force of many zombies to open their cage, returning successfully to the shelter, rescuing Lorraine, Rosie, and the keys to both cages and chains. They don't get very far before Vic emerges from the shelter and shoots at them. Lorraine sacrifices herself for them to escape.Thoomi leads Andy to the cage he visited earlier, but the man inside is gone. They evade Vic tracking them down, and spend the night in a small gulch. After releasing each other of their chain, they are presumed to fall asleep, until later in the night Thoomi wakes up to heavy breathing and hides with Rosie while Andy rubs his face against blood on the wall. The following morning Andy and Thoomi have a conversation about her father's health, which results in Thoomi running off after Andy asserts her father will not get better. The same woman who has been seen calling for Thoomi leaves Willie's jacket on a tree limb. Thoomi arrives to see her father has been straddled atop the tree, dead. Andy arrives to comfort her, but leaves promptly when he cannot console Thoomi. He has another breakdown and begins to try and burrow his head into the ground. Thoomi remains at the tree grieving, but is able to hear Rosie's cry and goes to retrieve her. Andy is confronted by Thoomi after he rouses, who has decided to help him reach the river.They travel by motorboat to the campsite where Andy last saw the family, inspecting the RV in which the family was staying. Andy leaves with Rosie to go find the family, while Thoomi stays in the RV. He meets the father, who has been bitten, and once again shows him his revolver. The father says it contains six bullets, and that Andy can have the remaining two once he uses them on himself and his family. Andy retreats as three gunshots are heard in the distance. The fourth is delayed while the father follows Andy, using it on himself and collapsing behind him. Andy collects the gun as intended and debates whether to shoot himself as well. Thoomi rushes to them, having removed her leaves and claiming she is ready to go home. They set off together towards the sight of smoke on a nearby hill.As they pass through a train tunnel, they encounter Vic. Thoomi hides with Rosie inside a parked vehicle on the tracks, while Andy tries to distract Vic. The two men fight, and Andy shoots the bullets, but misses both times. Andy, briefly defeated, is unable to help Thoomi, who Vic pulls from the car, in the process hitting her head on the rails. She lies in pain, Vic grabbing hold of Rosie. Andy rises to check on Thoomi, who is still alive, and then Rosie, who Vic is cradling, lamenting the incidental death of Lorraine. He tearfully hands over Rosie so that Andy can renew his walk with a hurt Thoomi.On the way Andy has another lapse, almost indulging in decayed meat. With little time left, Andy asks of Thoomi to promise to look after Rosie, with whom Andy shares a farewell before preparing himself for the finalization by placing a guard in his mouth, binding his wrists, and wrapping the meat from earlier on a stick. He then succumbs, his eyes crusted over.The Aboriginal warriors have finished their raid, but Thoomi calls out to them with a whistle, drawing attention of the woman, her mother. Thoomi and Rosie are riding Andy, who is guided by the meat on the stick, and being perfectly harmless is detained by the warriors while Thoomi and Rosie are welcomed back by her mother. One of the warriors attempts to strike Andy with his spear, but Thoomi stops him. She takes out Kay's perfume bottle, and sprays it one last time, the smell pacifying Andy, for a moment returning his consciousness as he realizes Rosie is finally safe. Thoomi then allows the warrior to put Andy out of his misery.The Aboriginal people are seen traveling to a refuge of many of their people where they are welcomed heartily. As Thoomi and her mother inspect Rosie, the words Thank You are read on her stomach, written in white paint which Thoomi and the warriors have used to disguise their scent from the zombies. The final shots of the movie are of Andy's plaid shirt and Rosie's fishing bait mobile hung on a tree."
Mudbound,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2396589/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two men return home from World War II to work on a farm in rural Mississippi, where they struggle to deal with racism and adjusting to life after war. In the aftermath of WWII, somewhere in the muddy Mississippi Delta, two families--one black, the Jacksons, and the other white, the McAllans--are forced to share the same patch of land, keeping a frail race-based peace with each other. However, as they both struggle with hardship and dire poverty, the long-awaited return of two war veterans--Ronsel, the Jacksons' eldest son, and Jamie, Henry McAllan's younger brother--will unexpectedly nurture a budding friendship that transcends prejudice and race. But, in the end, against a backdrop of fevered Mississippi sunsets and vitriolic racism, life can be hard when the law of the land is still segregation and hatred. And then, no one can be safe.—Nick Riganas The movie opens on Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund) digging a grave for his father before rain and darkness come. He takes a break while his older brother, Henry (Jason Clarke), takes over. Both of them are working on the grave when the storm hits, and Jamie gets stuck. Henry saves him, despite Jamie's tearful worries he would have left him down there.The next morning we hear a voice-over from Laura (Carey Mulligan), Henry's wife, walking behind the coffin with their two daughters, about how the farm reminds her of mud. Henry and James are struggling with and arguing about how to fit the coffin in the grave.A black family, the Jacksons, drive by with their wagon. Although Laura tries to talk Henry out of it, he asks for their help.Laura's voice over then goes to the year 1939, explaining how she met Henry. Although she can't say she was truly in love with him, she was grateful and saw him as a rescuer and reprieve.Jamie meets Laura when he is coming home from school on the train, and she and Henry are there to pick him up. He is more innocent, clean-shaven, and talking about plays, which he admits is to impress Laura. He continues to shower her with stories at a fancy party and even dances with her, despite having just toasted to Laura and Henry getting married and having children.In her voice over as they dance, Laura admits that she was perhaps in love with Jamie. Henry explains his brother has that effect on girls.Laura explains that Henry's proposal was not what she expected, although, she does seem happy, however, since she admits she likes domestic life, which soon includes raising their daughters, and that she felt she was put on earth for such a reason.The scene shifts from Henry listening to the radio, distraught, as FDR addresses Pearl Harbor, to the Jackson family, saying goodbye to one of the sons, Ronsel (Jason Mitchell), who is giving his voice over about going off to fight in the war. His mother, Florence (Mary J. Blige), also gives a voice over about him going to fight.Ronsel's father, Hap (Rob Morgan), takes a break from working in the fields to talk about how his family worked the land all their lives and died without owning any of it. He seems fixated on acquiring a deed for his own land.Henry casually tells Laura after sex one night that they'll be moving to a farm in Mississippi in two weeks. He tries to tell her how much she and the girls will love it, but she's surprised, as she doesn't recall him ever telling her that it was his dream to have a farm.With the help of Henry's father, Pappy (Jonathan Banks) and his pickup truck, the family moves from their nice suburban neighborhood to a new house which doesn't seem too bad. Someone already lives there though, and the man who took money from Henry has left town. Pappy rants about Henry being a fool after the homeowner shuts the door in their faces. They have no other choice but to live on the farm, despite Pappy's protestations.The scenery quickly becomes different on the way to the dilapidated farmhouse, with a rickety bridge and dirt roads. A poor white family, the Atwoods, who are always shown covered in dirt, also live in the area.The Jackson family is sitting down to dinner when Henry interrupts by demanding help to unload the truck before it gets dark.Henry and Pappy argue about Hap riding in the truck with them, but it's the only way to ensure they can unload before it gets dark. Henry and Laura are both trying to do what they can to set things up, except Pappy who sulks in the corner and then tries to get Laura to give up her piano so he can sleep in the house. Henry and Laura fight over it, but Laura remains firm, and Pappy sleeps in the lean-to.Jamie and Ronsel are both seen fighting in the war. Jamie is an army pilot, telling his co-pilot who has just missed his daughter's birthday that he'll be home to see her soon. Ronsel, in Belgium, is writing a letter to his family about how they are often on the move.Back on the farm, Laura watches on from the porch while Henry fires Carl Atwood (Dylan Arnold) for a mistake with a horse. Carl begs to be kept on since he has kids and another on the way, but Henry is firm. Hap shoots the horse.Vera Atwood (Lucy Faust) later comes to the house with her daughter, Alma, to beg for their job back, but Laura tells her it's Henry's decision, not hers.Ronsel's letter continues about how white people treat black people differently in Europe compared to back home. We see that he has a white girlfriend, showing up at her house with flowers.The McAllan girls are sick with whooping cough, but Henry is unable to get into town to call for a doctor since it is raining too hard. He goes to the Jacksons', interrupting Hap reading Ronsel's letter, to demand the help of Florence, who is a midwife.In her voice-over, Florence talks about how her mother was a nurse to white children, and that in caring for the McAllan girls, and knowing that anything going wrong would be her fault, she understands what her mother went through. The girls do improve though under Florence's care.Florence agrees to work full time for the McAllan family, despite Hap trying to dissuade her from doing so. Juxtaposed with scenes on the farm are Jamie and Ronsel both in trouble.Jamie's co-pilot gets shot in the head through the window and dies while Jamie panics but stays alive. Ronsel is in a tank, where his friend is shot and killed. Another juxtaposition shows Hap falling from a roof, breaking his leg.Four weeks later, Henry comes to check on Hap, who expects to be back soon, despite how the doctor recommended he take six weeks. Henry is unsympathetic though and wants him back on the field for the sake of timing, and because of a rainstorm which had caused delay. Although Hap is hesitant because it means they'll have to owe money, he agrees to rent a mule from Henry for the work. Once Henry leaves, he tries to get out of bed on his own but ends up falling and crying out in pain.Jamie is shown on his bunk, drinking and very distraught about his co-pilot's death. He continues to drink for the rest of the film.When Henry tells Laura that Florence can't come back to work for them for a few weeks, Laura complains Henry didn't tell her, and that he should just lend Hap a mule. He refuses and tells her that they need to make their own money and look out for themselves.Laura acts on her own to take money Henry has locked away in a box, which she uses to send a doctor to take care of Hap. Henry remains angry with Laura though and refuses her advances at night in bed. Laura says in her voice-over that although she didn't always enjoy having sex with Henry, it made her feel like a wife.Jamie and Ronsel are celebrating with women in their own way when the war ends. Ronsel and his girlfriend are sad though as they realize their relationship is coming to an end.Laura says Saturday is her favorite day since it's the only day she feels clean. We can see that she and her daughters have also become constantly dirty, like the Atwoods. Despite how she is bathing, Pappy walks right by Laura.Jamie arrives home. Henry and the girls are delighted to see him, and Pappy comes around a bit after some jokes, but Laura seems caught off guard when Jamie hugs her.Later that night over drinks, Jamie, Pappy, and Henry talk about the war. Pappy says that he was told about Jamie earning high honors, and wants to know how many men he killed, but Jamie brushes off that he was just lucky and doesn't know. Pappy belittles Jamie by telling him that he at least looked the people he killed in the eye. Henry chastises Pappy when he walks away and tries to tell Jamie Pappy is proud of him. Jamie admits to Henry he actually killed about four Germans.Ronsel has to sit in the back of the bus sectioned off for black people, on his way home. He's in his uniform, and a young black boy salutes him with a smile, but Ronsel's voice-over explains how nothing's changed at home. He walks into the store in town, making conversation with the shop owner, with Laura also there to introduce herself.Despite how he's expected to leave through the back door, Ronsel tried to go out the front and is taunted by Pappy, who is with Henry and another man. Ronsel tries to leave calmly, but upon getting riled up lets them know how black soldiers were put on the front lines and killed many Germans and Japanese. Laura prevents Henry from intervening further and Ronsel leaves through the back door.It is now dark when Ronsel comes home, having walked. His father has just said grace, asking for Ronsel to be protected. Ronsel and his father have an emotional reunion.While Hap, Florence, and Ronsel are sitting outside on the porch, Henry shows up to tell them about the incident at the store. Once Ronsel confirms it is true, Hap has him apologize. After Henry leaves, Hap reminds Ronsel that white people will win every time.Jamie leaves the store from buying his own supplies when the sound of a car backfiring sends him to the ground in a flashback while the white people there just stare at him. Ronsel helps him as he's walking by and after they make their formal introductions, Jamie offers him a ride home in the truck.Once they are a safe distance away from town, Jamie convinces Ronsel to come up from the back of the truck to ride inside with him. They talk about their experiences in the war, with Jamie admitting he doesn't like Pappy either, and that he thinks Ronsel is acting stubborn when Jamie is trying to be nice to him after offering him a drink. They toast to the friends they both lost in the war.Hap is practicing his reading at home when he sees Jamie dropping Ronsel off home in his truck, nervous that something else could be wrong, but Jamie offers to give him rides more often.Laura is pregnant again, and Henry seems genuinely excited.Ronsel and Florence have a nice moment while the rest of the family is at an evening worship service. He gives her candy which she tries to save for the other children, but he makes her have it.Jamie's drinking is causing trouble at home too. Laura wakes up in the middle of the night to hear him muttering on the porch in her sleep. He eventually lets her calm him down but runs off in the car when he sees Henry at the door.In a voice-over, Laura says that Henry was always away when something bad happens, when Vera comes to their house, very pregnant, with a knife in her hand. She tries to demand that Laura take her into town since she's going to kill Carl for abusing their daughters. Laura explains she can't drive as Henry took away the keys. She tries to convince Vera to sit with her, but she leaves. Laura later learns that they found Carl's body, with Florence having seen Vera covered in blood after stabbing Carl 17 times.Laura is having a problem with her pregnancy and has one of her daughters get Florence, but still loses the baby. Florence tries to comfort her and tells her how she lost a baby too, Samuel.Jamie and Ronsel continue to hang out and share war stories.Laura is depressed for a time, but slowly gets better and plays the piano again. She also appears genuinely cheered up to discover that Jamie has built a shower for her, as a surprise, to give her privacy.Florence explains in a voice-over that she is concerned for Ronsel, who does seem on edge, except for when Jamie picks him up for them to hang out. When it is just the two of them sitting on the porch late at night, Florence and Hap discuss how they think Ronsel should move, which Hap thinks will make him happier. He and Florence have a nice moment dancing on the porch while they both hum a song.Ronsel and Jamie are out drinking, discussing how they miss certain aspects of the war. Ronsel especially does, since black men were considered liberators and treated better, but that he's just considered a black man back home in Mississippi.In talking about the women he's been with, Jamie deduces that Ronsel was with white women in Europe, and even learns that he had a girlfriend there. Ronsel won't say much about her though.In bed at night, Ronsel gets emotional over holding his girlfriend's cross. On his way back home alone, driving drunk, Jamie has another flashback. He is found the next morning by the sheriff and Henry, his car nearly in the pond.Ronsel sleeps late the next day, with Hap giving him a hard time for having stayed in bed while his siblings worked. His sister hands him a letter from Germany, and he runs off with a smile on his face to read it.Jamie and Henry get into a fight when Jamie spills milk and laughs about it. Henry calls him out for being drunk while Jamie fires back about how Henry can't see that his farm is failing or that Laura is doing badly. Henry says he's going away for a few days, and that he expects Jamie to be gone when he gets back.Ronsel is walking in the mud and pouring rain when a pickup truck starts chasing him. It turns out to be Jamie, getting a laugh out of the trick he played on Ronsel. They're both hesitant to talk about what's bothering them, but when Jamie asks him what's the worst thing he's ever done, Ronsel admits it was leaving his girlfriend and shows him a picture of his girlfriend with a baby clearly fathered by Ronsel, named Franz. Rosnel tells Jamie that his girlfriend wants Ronsel to come back to Germany.The two drive around carefree, drinking, and singing along with the radio. Jamie sees Pappy driving with another man, and it's not clear if Ronsel can hide in time. Upon dropping him off, Jamie tells Ronsel that he is leaving, with the two acknowledging their friendship and Jamie hoping for Ronsel that he gets to go back to his son. They say goodbye, and Ronsel goes home to find just his mother there since the rest of the family is at church.Laura and Pappy are home with the girls. As soon as Jamie walks in, Pappy can tell that Jamie is drunk, and demands to know who was in the truck with him. Jamie admits right away that it was Ronsel and Pappy demands the keys, also antagonizing Laura by pointing out how he can tell Laura likes Jamie.While getting into the truck, Pappy finds the letter on the front seat. At his house, Ronsel realizes that he no longer has it. Florence tries to stop him from leaving until his father gets back, but he takes off. Jamie is packing up, to Laura's surprise since she didn't know he was leaving. She tries to stop him from leaving, on account of her daughters, but also herself. She kisses him, and they end up having sex.Ronsel is outside in the rain at night, distraught, trying to look for the picture, when he is jumped by white men in their trucks. Jamie is asleep in bed when Pappy wakes him, accompanied by members of the KKK. They bring him to a barn full of other white men, where Ronsel is tied, beaten, and with a noose around his neck.Jamie tries to get them to set Ronsel free, and fights with his father, also trying to defend Ronsel to the rest of the men over the picture of Ronsel's girlfriend and his son, but they ignore him while getting Ronsel to admit he fathered the child.Jamie gains control of someone's gun and aims it at his father, but Pappy is correct that Jamie ""doesn't have the balls to kill a man up close."" Another man gets control of the gun, someone is shot in the leg, and it isn't long before Jamie is on his knees and knocked unconscious.When Jamie is brought to, Ronsel is now naked, bloody, nearly unconscious and tied to the wall, as Pappy and the KKK decide to make Jamie decide what will happen to Ronsel. Jamie is forced to decide on them removing Ronsel's eyes, tongue, or testicles, to which he decides tongue. Ronsel wakes up screaming and struggling, and Jamie is held down, forced to helplessly look on.Ronsel is left tied naked hanging in the barn wen his family finds him. Jamie is dropped off back in bed, still bleeding and barely conscious.The next church service is awkwardly quiet, save for a baby crying. Hap just sits up at the altar, not saying anything, just looking up at the sky.Laura goes to wake Pappy up. Jamie, still bloody, but now awake, is sitting on a chair, as he tells Laura, he killed Pappy. Jamie smothered him with a pillow, but beforehand he woke him up to let Pappy know he wanted to look him in the eye.When Henry arrives home, Laura tells him that Pappy died, but says he did so peacefully in his sleep.We are now back to the beginning, with Hap and Florence driving by, Ronsel in the wagon. Henry asks them for help, to which Hap acquiesces, though he refuses to have his sons help. Hap also gives words over Pappy's grave before getting back in the wagon. Before they leave, Jamie runs over for Florence to give Ronsel the letter, ""if you see him,"" and walks away so that Henry is left to dig the grave himself.Ronsel's voice over explains his nightmares about being in the tank and with a burlap sack over his head, not being able to scream.While walking around in a nice suit in a city, though still appearing unsettling, Jamie says that he hoped ""Pappy's untimely death"" brought Ronsel's family peace, and for Ronsel to find happiness, though he himself didn't find peace. The Jackson family does appear to be doing well, dressed in finer clothes, at their own house, with Hap genuinely happy.Ronsel's voice-over continues with him talking about how he should end his story, which involved overcoming much as a mute. As he makes his way through Europe, to his girlfriend, and now son who is a few years older, he says he is there this time not for war but for love, and that love is how he chooses to end his story."
Sand Castle,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582576/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story follows a young soldier, and his introduction into the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Based on true events, it bears witness to the destruction and horrors of war. A soldier enlists just before the 9/11. He is not a brave man--simply volunteering to defend freedom. Arriving in Iraq in 2003, just after the occupation of Bagdad, with a few soldiers of his infantry platoon, he is sent to provide water to a village whose infrastructure was destroyed. Simple things however, such as water transportation, water distribution and the reconstruction of the plumbing became a challenge in war environment. At the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War, Pvt. Matt Ocre (Nicholas Hoult), a young civil affairs soldier with the Army Reserves slams his hand in the door of a Humvee in an attempt to get sent home. Narration reveals that he enlisted in July 2001, in order to get money for college. Some time later, he is seen with a cast on his arm, his attempt having been unsuccessful. His cast gets cut off just in time to be sent to Baghdad. During the battle, Ocre spots a sniper and Sergeant Dylan Chutsky (Glen Powell) calls in a helicopter strike that destroys the building the sniper is in.The film then skips forward to some time after the battle, when Ocre's squad is tasked with repairing a broken water system in the dangerous village of Baqubah. They arrive in the village and meet up with a Special Forces unit led by Cpt. Syverson (Henry Cavill). Syverson introduces them to their interpreter and explains that they are to travel to the pump station and fill a tanker with water to bring back to the village every day. At the station, the Army engineers working on the pump explain that it will take many weeks to finish repairs, but that the repairs would go much faster if Harper could recruit some of the villagers to help. Back at the village, they inform the locals that they will pay anyone who shows up to work the next morning. However, when the morning comes, there is no one there by the time they are ready to leave. With no labor forthcoming from the village, they are forced to help the engineers themselves. During one return trip, a vehicle is spotted coming up behind them at high speed. They stop the vehicle and interrogate the driver, but learn he is taking his young daughter to another village for medicine.

Something terrible is definitely happening in the a peaceful suburban community as, day by day, former caring parents mysteriously turn into ravenous carriers of an unfathomable pandemic that targets their offspring. Suddenly, like every son and daughter in the entire nation, teenage Carly and Josh Ryan must run for their lives, as the rage-filled murderous intent is as unstoppable as it is inexplicable.

The Ryans' rut abruptly ends one day when without apparent reason, first along their suburb and gradually throughout the country, loving parents turn homicidal on their own offspring. Several parents pursue and kill their children in a bloody slaughter right at their own school.

In this classic Agatha Christie detective story, former diplomat Charles Hayward has returned from Cairo to London to become a private detective. When Aristide Leonides, a wealthy and ruthless tycoon, is poisoned in his own bed, Detective Hayward is invited to solve the crime. As the investigation deepens he must confront the shocking realization that one of the key suspects is Aristede's beautiful granddaughter, his employer and former lover; and must keep a clear head to navigate the sultry Sophia and the rest of her hostile family. Multi-millionaire Aristide Leonides has just died, apparently of a heart attack. Private investigator Charles Hayward is approached by his granddaughter Sophia and asked to investigate his death as she believes he was murdered. Hayward takes on the case and visits the Leonides estate, questioning the family. He discovers that it is far from a simple case - the family is incredibly dysfunctional and nothing is as it seems.—grantss When a wealthy tycoon is poisoned in his own bed, Detective Charles Hayward (Irons) is invited to solve the gruesome crime. He is shocked to discover that one of the key suspects is the tycoon's beautiful granddaughter Sophia (Martini), his former lover. Hayward must keep a clear head to navigate the sultry Sophia and the rest of her hostile family in a case where nobody is above suspicion. The granddaughter of late Greek-British business tycoon Aristide Leonides, Sophia Leonides, visits private investigator Charles Hayward in his office. Sophia wants Charles to investigate Aristide's death, for she believes he was murdered by a member of his sprawling and idiosyncratic family. Sophia notes that Aristide' regular insulin injection had been laced with eserine from his eye drops, causing a fatal heart attack. Sophia believes this was deliberate, not accidental. Charles reluctantly takes on the case, in part because he had a brief love affair with Sophia in Cairo. Charles seeks the consent of Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard to look into the case, utilizing his personal connection with Taverner, who had served with Charles's father, a decorated former Assistant Commissioner who was murdered.At the Leonides estate, Charles interviews the various members of the family, finding motives for each of them. All of them get substantial bequests from Aristide's estate. All of them knew about the eserine: Aristide talked about how it could be used to kill him. All of them resented the way he bullied and manipulated them.Lady Edith de Haviland was the sister of Aristide's late first wife; she moved in to care for her motherless nephews. She despised her brother-in-law as a parvenu and for his callousness towards his grandchildren. Edith stalks around the grounds, blasting moles in the lawn with a shotgun.Aristide's elder son, Philip, hated his father for passing him over as successor to the family business, and for refusing to fund production of a screenplay Philip wrote for his wife, Magda, a fading theater actress.Philip and Magda provided Aristide with three grandchildren: Sophia, Eustace (a teenager crippled by polio, who believes his grandfather despised him), and Josephine (a clever 12-year-old, who spies on everyone and writes it down in her notebook).The younger son, Roger, is managing director of a major family business, but is a failure, requiring multiple bail-outs from Aristide. His domineering wife Clemency is a plant biologist with extensive knowledge of poisons.Aristide's second wife, Brenda, is much younger, a former Las Vegas casino dancer. The others suspect her of killing Aristide, especially Roger, who denounces her as a gold-digging slut and certainly guilty. She did administer the fatal insulin injection. Also, she is having an affair with Laurence Brown, private tutor for the Leonides children. And when Aristide's will is produced, it is unsigned. Thus he died intestate, and Brenda will inherit his entire estate.Charles's inquiries meet with hostility from most of the family. Josephine hints that she has found clues she does not disclose, to Charles's irritation. Events take a new, horrific turn when the ladder to Josephine's tree house is sabotaged and she falls from the tree, being hospitalized as a result. Charles suspects that this was due to Josephine's habit of spying on the other family members and the killer thus wanting to silence her.Charles' suspicions even extend to Sophia after a new, properly signed will is discovered, leaving the estate to her. Eustace even suggests that Sophia hired Charles to investigate the murder due to their personal history, knowing he would never accuse her due to their romantic past.After those developments, Taverner arrives in person to take charge of the case; he feels Charles' romantic history with Sophia does not make him objective enough to solve it. The discovery of love letters between Brenda and Laurence gives Taverner enough evidence to arrest them for Aristide's murder and the attempt on Josephine.Charles, however, remains unconvinced that Brenda and Laurence are guilty, noting Brenda's childlike intelligence and Laurence's pacifist, left-wing views as making them unlikely candidates for being a murderer. Sophia and Edith seem to agree. Sophia notes that the letters could have been forged, and Edith insists on ""the best lawyer"" to represent Brenda and Laurence. In the meantime, however, Charles returns to London. Edith visits a London doctor, and learns she is dying of cancer. Charles returns to the estate when Josephine's nanny is fatally poisoned by hot chocolate that she had prepared for herself and Josephine.Charles implores Josephine to name the killer, as he has worked out that she knows. Again, Josephine smugly refuses to tell, even when Charles warns her that she is in danger. Edith collects Josephine, and drives out of the estate (supposedly for ice cream), lying to get past the police at the gate.The coroner finds that the nanny died of cyanide poisoning, Charles suspects Edith, who used cyanide to kill moles. He searches Edith's garden shed, and finds a bottle of cyanide; also Josephine's missing notebook, buried in quicklime that would have destroyed it.Just then, Sophia tells him that Edith has left with Josephine. Charles and Sophia take off in pursuit of Edith, who left a note for Charles to find in his car. Sophia reads Edith's note: it is a confession to the murder, but Charles doesn't believe it.Sophia then starts reading from Josephine's notebook, and discovers the horrible truth: Josephine murdered Aristide. He had stopped her ballet lessons (with insulting comments), and she was bored. Josephine also staged her fall from the tree house, poisoned the nanny, who had begun to suspect her, and forged Brenda's love letters. Lady Edith had worked out that Josephine was the killer. She confessed to exonerate Brenda and Laurence, and perhaps to spare Josephine a life in psychiatric institutions. But Edith isn't taking Josephine for ice cream. As Charles and Sophia catch up, she drives off the edge of a quarry, killing herself and Josephine. The film ends as Charles comforts a shocked Sophia at the edge of the cliff."

A school girl saves the life of one of the aliens and together must deal with humans who intend them harm.—vvp_14 After a spaceship crash-lands in the center of Moscow, a young woman finds herself torn between loyalty to her seemingly normal life and the allure of a new state of being promised by one of the aliens. The story-line revolves around colonel Valentin Lebedev (Oleg Menshikov), who is in charge of the military operation, his daughter Yulia (Irina Starshenbaum), who develops a romantic relationship with the alien Hekon (Rinal Mukhametov), and her former boyfriend Artyom (Alexander Petrov) who is the main antagonist.Hekon is a representative of a technologically-advanced humanoid race who arrives to Earth incognito for research purposes. His spaceship was damaged by a meteor shower. The Russian Air Force mistook his spaceship for a NATO spy satellite/spacecraft and damaged it by firing missiles into it, causing it to crash into several buildings in Moscow and kill hundreds of people. It was on that same day when Yulia and Artyom had finished attending a meteor-watching event, when Yulia's friend Svetlana (Darya Rudenok) was killed while watching some meteors.The Russian government decided not to enter into a contact with the ship and let it fix itself on its own. The landing area was evacuated, fenced, and guarded, and Moscow was placed under a curfew. Meanwhile, Yulia, Artyom, and his friends Khariton, Ruslan (Nikita Kukushkin), and Piton (Evgeniy Sangadzhiev) sneak into the crash site to investigate the alien: after they beat him up and cause him to crash down a building, they retrieve his armor before an army patrol may find them. On another day, Yulia sneaks again to retrieve the alien, placing him to a nerdy classmate known as ""Google"" (Evgeniy Mikheev) to help the alien recover. While examining his body, she notices a wristband forming on her right wrist, which manipulates water.The alien, who introduces himself as ""Hekon"", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells them that he is looking for a device known as ""Shilk"", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like the spaceship, appears to be attracting water. As he goes out to the streets to look for the device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated.Meanwhile, Artyom and his friends drive in their car to inform Colonel Lebedev about the alien's armor that they had hidden in their garage. and stumble upon a crowd who is angry over rationed water, as the spaceship appears to absorb water in order to repair itself. Ruslan decides to provoke the crowd into becoming a disorderly riot. Artyom is hit by a policeman's baton as he tries to convince people to start rioting, and is taken to the police station but he forgets to tell Colonel Lebedev about his discovery.
In order to get Shilk, Yulia goes to see her father, who interrupts his meeting with his officers when she informed him that she is pregnant with Hekon's child. She actually says this to distract him, so Hekon can disguise himself as a scientist and take Shilk from its container, and also because she was upset that he did not spend much time with her after her mother passed away.Yulia confesses her true feelings for Hekon in a phone call to Artyom, while Artyom arrives with his friends to beat up the alien. Hekon fights back, and when one of Artyom's friends tries to shoot Hekon, Ruslan is shot by accident instead. Artyom and one of his friends flee before the police would arrest them. He reports this incident to gather many supporters and form a group to attack Hekon's spaceship, and avenge Ruslan's death, whom he blames the alien for causing it. In spite of his initial support, Piton sometimes expresses doubt on Artyom's goals.Artyom's group breaks through a police barricade, triggering several other robotic suits to come out and fight against the mob. Yulia and Hekon drive through the police barricade and the mob using a military car to return him and Shilk back to their ship, while fending off against Artyom, who angrily rampages using Hekon's suit. Hekon defeats Artyom, but Artyom shoots him and Yulia with a dropped military rifle. Saddened by this, Colonel Lebedev follows several walking suits as they carry Yulia and Hekon to the spaceship, where its machinery uses water to nurse Yulia's injuries. The spaceship's computer also responds to Lebedev's questions about Hekon's mission to observe the Earth, as its warlike civilizations and history had made it very unsafe for interstellar contact. However, Yulia's love for Hekon, and her willingness to protect him, have caused the computer's authorities to rewrite the results of their study on Earth.Yulia, her father, and everyone else return to their daily lives, as the spaceship departs and releases excess water. Meanwhile, Artyom is arrested and presumably sent to a prison camp.
The song of the movie is vocalized by Yulia at the end: The truth is that one alien from far away trusted us more than we trust ourselves."

Joining forces with a former client (Samara Weaving) who has a grudge of her own, Derek savagely fights tooth and nail to get to the executives on the top floor and settle the score once and for all. Derek Cho (Steven Yeun) tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or ""Red Eye"" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a co-worker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office.One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client Melanie Cross (Samara Weaving) who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her.

CDC agents have released a neutralizing agent into the building, estimating that it will take eight hours for the virus to be obliterated. Derek, realizing he's infected by the virus and will not be liable for anything he does, attacks the security guards and storms into the elevator, intending to get upstairs and kill his boss; however, he's sent down to the basement and beaten up by Towers' enforcer, ""The Bull"" (André Eriksen). The Bull kills Ewan by mistake, infuriating Derek further.Derek is thrown into an empty office with Melanie, who is also infected.

They first go up to The Reaper and kill two security guards to get to him, witnessing general mayhem along the way.

These strange occurrences continue and lead Dylan to meet Sarah, with whom he feels inexplicably linked. Together they discover uncanny similarities with their current predicament and a double murder committed a generation ago. With a grim fate looming, Dylan must solve the mystery of 2:22 to preserve a love whose second chance has finally come.—AnonymousB The film starts with Dylan Branson having a dream about a murder at the Grand Central Station that feels very real. He wakes with a start and progresses with his routine while watching news about a star called Hamlin that died out 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the Earth 30 years later and that this supernova will have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. Dylan is an air traffic controller who possess a unique ability to visualize patterns.Dylan is then shown on his way to work, riding a bike and heading to the Grand Central Station to take the train. He works as air traffic controller with a serious talent in visualizing patterns. After work, he goes to a club drinking with his co workers and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet as a gift for his upcoming birthday. The following day at exactly 2:22pm, his world stops after he almost causes a mid air collision of the two aircraft as he was actually attempting to avoid the mid-air collision, resulting in him being suspended from his job for nearly killing over 900 people.The day after he was suspended, he attends the aerial ballet and meets Sarah. They go to a restaurant and start talking, Dylan tells Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also trained to be a pilot but could never become one as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery. He also tells her about his being suspended from work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane that almost collided with the other aircraft at 2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for saving her life. As they depart, they admit to each other that for a ""first date"" they felt a deep connection and it felt like they had known each other forever.The following day, while on the way to the Grand Central, Dylan notices the same happenings (siren, a woman laughing, construction sounds, ""Can I help you with"", glass breaking) and at 2:21pm, he hears the announcement of the boarding of the Millhurst express, sees a business man reading his newspaper, a couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers where the last child in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly 2:22pm, the window of the station shatters. He goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to an early dinner, going to the Central Park with her. Sarah tells Dylan that she was a ballet dancer student before she landed awkwardly and tore two of her knee ligaments. Cheering her up, Dylan creates an improvised speaker using a paper cup and ice cream cone holder, lifting Sarah's mood, then dancing and kissing. They go to Dylan's apartment and make love. The next morning, Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from, to which Sarah replies that it was from her ex-boyfriend; Jonas (Sam Reid) who happens to be the main artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out that both of them were born on the same day; April 18, 1986 and they are both turning 30 within a week's time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15am, and he tells Sarah that it was 3rd day in a row that the same incident had happened.Dylan takes a cab with a reckless driver going to Grand Central. As the driver takes the shorter route, Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh, construction sounds, and a man saying ""Can I help you with"". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns around to tell Dylan off for shouting at him. Just then, another car hits them both, causing the breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central Station and sees the exact same pattern of events. He tells Sarah of these repeating patterns, but with different people carrying out the same actions. Sarah does not believe Dylan, but helps to clean his wounds from the car accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing all the events of his day starting from 9.10am (water drop, a bug dying, a plane flying overhead etc) and realizes that everything has a pattern that's repeating itself.Dylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah, and realizes that the gallery was having an exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main exhibition. Jonas has created a light hologram exhibition about the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it is exactly like the events that he has experienced the past few days (announcement of the boarding of Millhurst Express, a business man reading his newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line of preschoolers where the last one in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clocks). Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking him as only Dylan knows about these events. He attacks Jonas, resulting in a brawl and questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him. In the audience is the owner of the Keifer Gallery and he applauds saying it was a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand Central Station that happened 30 years ago and that he has an exhibit related to it at his gallery. Sarah apologizes to Jonas about Dylan's attack and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.Later that night, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her forgiveness. In the mean time, he finds a stack of envelopes hidden in his home. He finds out a man named Jake Redman had written these letters to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation, Dylan finds out that Jake was a criminal, although he was never convicted for his crimes as the police could not find enough evidence to pin him down, while Evelyn was a singer, and they both were lovers. Dylan also finds an article online stating that Jack had shot Evelyn and another policeman, Noah, down in the Grand Central Station in a fit of jealous rage before being gunned down by other policemen on 18 April 1986, which was the day both Dylan and Sarah were born.Dylan then visits Evelyn's sister, and she gives Dylan a stack of letters that Jack wrote to Evelyn as she could never bear to read them and shows him the necklace she is wearing saying that it was all she needs to remember her. The necklace is identical to the one that Dylan had seen Sarah wear. She also tells him that Noah; the policeman was taking Evelyn to Millhurst to keep her safe from Jake and that it seemed that he was also in love with Evelyn. Noah goes to the Grand Central Station to buy a ticket for the Millhurst Express, but is told that the service was terminated 30 years ago and now the train is known as the Poughkeepsie Express. At exactly 2:22pm the chandelier crashes to the floor.Dylan connects the dots and realizes that Dylan was Jake in his past life, while Sarah was Evelyn, and that he would kill her at Grand Central Station on their birthday, 18 April at 2.22pm. He realizes that the pattern of events that has been happening was leading up to the day they both would die. He tells Sarah this and she does not believe him. As she tries to calm Dylan down, Dylan insists that they both should break up as he would soon kill Sarah, which he does not want to as he knows that they are soulmates.Dylan contemplates suicide, which was unsuccessful, while a distraught Sarah looks for Jonas in his apartment. Jonas offers to bring Sarah to Millhurst to help her feel better about the breakup. The next day, both Jonas and Sarah's flight to Millhurst gets canceled and they have to go to Grand Central Station to take a train there. Meanwhile, Dylan looks for Sarah and in the midst of it, he breaks into Jonas' apartment and sees that Jonas recognizes Sarah as Evelyn in his past life and that he was Noah. Dylan figures out that Jonas/Noah is obsessed with Sarah/Evelyn and that Jonas/Noah had a gun with him and races to the Grand Central Station to see her. On his way he attracts the attention of the police and leads them there.At the Grand Central Station, Sarah realizes that the patterns Dylan saw were true and she tries to leave but is stopped by a crazed Jonas calling her Evelyn. He wants Sarah to admit that she loves him, while Sarah refuses just as Dylan arrives at the Station. Jonas thinking that Sarah called him there gets enraged and makes his way towards Dylan with a gun while Sarah sees the events unfold as Dylan had described them to her, and realizes that she is the pregnant woman standing under the clock. Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan and then Sarah saying that ""she'll never be yours"" intending to kill her so that if he couldn't have her neither could Dylan but Dylan shields Sarah just in time but himself gets shot at 2:21pm.The events from 30 years ago plays out with Jake/Dylan protecting Sarah/Evelyn from Noah/Jonas and at exactly 2:22pm. Jonas gets shot by the police who have followed Dylan there. Dylan also falls in Evelyn's arms and momentarily closes his eyes having visions of Jake and Evelyn being affectionate. He does not die and Sarah then looks at the clock, saying it was 2.23pm and they managed to survive. Turns out that the Jake was framed for murdering Noah and Evelyn as the police had wanted to save the reputation of Noah since he was a police detective and one of them. Also the dying star; Hamlin mentioned at the start of the movie finally disappears but a new star is immediately reborn.In the ending scene, it is shown that Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with Dylan having finally overcome his fear of flying and is now a pilot and Sarah smiling affectionately at their baby in the cradle."

War Machine,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4758646/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An idiosyncratic general confronts opposition from enemies, allies, and bureaucrats while leading a massive rebuilding operation in Afghanistan. A general from the U.S. is sent to Afghanistan to ""clean"" the situation up after eight years of war in the country. He finds himself among tired soldiers and disillusioned politicians eager to leave. In this situation, he feels his mission is to ""win"" the war, something deemed impossible by everyone around him.—anton-osgard A tough general, hardened in his ways, knowledgeable about counterinsurgency operations, finds himself up against his own government and troops, confused about his own purpose, and without a clear plan of how to deal with the politics of ""nation-building"". A general with prior experience is sent to Afghanistan with a mission shrouded in vagueness, nonexistent political support and a lack of confidence from the U.S. government. However, with the team of supporters and aides that surround him, a strategic ""battle"" plan is set into motion that is questionable by those who already believe there is no hope, and flawless by those that are closest to him. Four-star General Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt) (a character based on General Stanley McChrystal. He is portrayed as an accomplished general with degrees from West Point and Yale brought in to bring a resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan) is sent to Afghanistan to bring the war to an end, but finds himself to be the one under attack. Glen was from a military family. He was a straight A student and a trouble maker all his life. His troops loved him as he never sent them where he wouldn't go himself. Prior to Afghanistan Glen was heading the secret forces in IRaq. Glen felt that the Afghan war was not being won as it was not being led. in Iraq he authored a book on leadership ""One leg at a time""..The first thing Glen tries is to get the military commanders of the 43 nations serving under his command to come out of their cabins and share common space.
Colonel Cory Staggart (John Magaro) (an Army Ranger and General McMahon's executive officer). Major General Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall) (ISAF Director of Intelligence, loosely based on Mike Flynn). Greg graduated in the same class as Glen from Westpoint and has worked with Glen ever since. USAF Tech Sgt. Andy Moon (RJ Cyler) (information technology support assistant), who fixed all gadgets for Glen. Lieutenant Commander Pete Duckman (Anthony Hayes) (a Navy SEAL and member of McMahon's staff), and nobody knew what exactly he did. USN Rear Admiral Simon Ball (Daniel Betts) (McMahon's Senior Public Affairs Officer). Matt Little (Topher Grace) (a former lobbyist turned McMahon's civilian media adviser). Sgt. Willy Dunne (Emory Cohen) (General McMahon's body man), Willy did Glen's clothes, Ironing and mundane stuff like that.Pat McKinnon (Alan Ruck) (United States Ambassador to Afghanistan loosely based off Karl Eikenberry). Dick Waddle (Nicholas Jones) (loosely based off Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke) & Ray Canucci (Griffin Dunne) (a United States Department of State senior official).
Glen meets Pat, Dick and Ray, who tell him give an assessment on what he needs to finish the war in Afghan but also cautiously instruct him not to ask for more troops. Glen has a general condescension of civilians who he thinks have not earned their power like he had. To Glen they were just obstacles in his path.Glen next meets Afghan President Hamid Karzai (Ben Kingsley) and invites on his Afghan assessment tour. But Hamid feigns ill health to talk Glen out of it. Glen goes on a tour of Afghanistan and quickly figures that the war is not being won as its an insurgency (a war led by local people & not an army). So the US strategy has been counter insurgency (install a local government, provide security so that democracy can flourish, train the local forces, stimulate the local economy (which is heroin basically), build the local infra (schools, hospitals and stuff like that), Nation building, hearts and minds).The top British commander in charge of Helmand province tells Glen that the whole province is owned by Taliban and the coalition only secures the base there. He advises Glen to cut Helmand loose and concentrate on provinces where there is some support for their mission.
Counter insurgency has been a failure everywhere (Vietnam, British empire and so on) as you cant build a nation at gunpoint. But Glen believed it hadn't been done as it hadn't been done right. His strategy is to take Helmand and Kandahar, precisely as everyone thinks Americans cant have it. He asks for 40,000 additional troops which makes Dick furious. He request is eventually turned down by US Secretary of State (based on Hillary Clinton). He is asked to wait till the Afghan elections are over. Till then his orders are SNORPP (Systemic Negation Of Repetitive Procedural Practice).Glen meets with a group of marines on their way back from R&R in Italy. They are all tired and listless. Sgt. Ricky Ortega (Will Poulter) is the squad leader and Cpl. Billy Cole (Keith Stanfield) is a disillusioned Marine. Billy grills Glen on how the marines can be winning hearts and minds of civilians when he knows every 10th one of them is trying to kill him. He does not understand Glen's policy of medals for ""Courageous Restraint"" which is Glen's way of reminding marines that they are here to protect the civilians.
On the day of the Afghan elections Captain Badi Basim (Aymen Hamdouchi) joins the team. Badi is a scholarly Afghan National Army officer who becomes General McMahon's Aide-De-Camp. Dick & pat inform Glen that the elections had widespread reports of graft and hence would need to be re-done. Glen is furious. He leaks his assessment report to the media and gives a 60 minutes interview saying that he has spoken to the President just once since taking charge of the forces in Afghanistan 70 days ago.President Obama (Reggie Brown) authorizes a 30,000 unit troop surge in response, but with a expiry period of just 18 months. Glen is again furious as this basically means that the Taliban can simply wait out 18 months and then retake the country when the troop surge goes back down.
Since the troop surge is not enough, Glen travels through Europe trying to get the rest of the coalition to increase their troop commitments. In Paris, he meets his wife Jeanie McMahon (Meg Tilly), spending an awkward morning with her.
The next morning Glen is invited to a meeting with Obama on-board air force one. Glen has to reschedule his entire day to be able to meet the president, only to see the President snub him and not taking him on-board Air force one.The french agree to give Glen the extra troops but warn that Germans may be inclined to withdraw altogether. Sean Cullen (Scoot McNairy) (a cynical journalist for Rolling Stone who accompanies McMahon and his staff and acts as narrator throughout the film, loosely based on author Michael Hastings). Sean is assigned to cover Glen in all his official appearances.Due to the volcano eruption in Greenland, Glen and his entourage has to travel to Berlin by road. In Berlin a German Politician (Tilda Swinton) relentlessly drives home the point that Glen's troop surge is driven by his own personal ambition to leave his own legacy in the war theatre in Afghanistan. In fact, the real reason for the war, the Al-Qaeda was not mentioned by Glen even once for the troop surge. She says to Glen that her job is to make sure that Glen's personal ambition does not carry a huge cost for everyone else. Glen is shaken to the core by this. Germany agrees to the troop surge, but says that they wont leave the base.The surge starts and with that Glen attacks Helmand province. The Italy R&R platoon is the first back on ground leading the offensive. The unit comes under attack but Billy realizes it was only a family that was retaliating when their unit's stray grenade killed their little girl. Once the town is secure, Glen comes to speak to the town elders. He speaks to them about his vision of roads, schools and jobs. But the Pashtuns tell Glen that when the Americans leave the Taliban will simply move back and asks them to leave now.Admist all this, Sean Cullen's article comes out that describes Glen and his entourage as shit talking the President and the Vice President and having drunken parties all over Europe instead of fighting the war. Glen knows he is finished. He is recalled to Washington and fired by Obama
Glen's replacement is General Bob White (Russell Crowe) (similar to David Petraeus)"

Later, Barbara explains the mythology behind the giants to Sophia.

It says to run from death is to reject life, and that she must find joy in every moment while she can. Barbara swims back to the beach, where she reunites with Sophia.The next day, Barbara climbs upstairs to see her mother, who lies dying in her bed. They share heartfelt messages and Barbara apologizes for avoiding her. After the summer break, Barbara's mother dies, but Barbara rekindles her relationships with Mrs. Mollé, Karen and Sophia.

In April 1980, armed gunmen stormed the Iranian Embassy in Princes Gate, London and took all inside hostage. Over the next six days a tense standoff took place, all the while a group of highly trained soldiers from the SAS prepared for a raid the world had never seen.—GFC On April 30, 1980, six unknown men storm the Iranian Embassy in London and take twenty-six people inside hostage, most of them staff - Iranian nationals - with a handful of British. The six eventually identify themselves as Arab Iranians - Arabs a minority in a Persian dominated Iran - whose demand in this action is for the Iranian government to release ninety-one Arabs they are holding as political prisoners, the six who threaten to kill hostages if their demands are not met. The difficulty for the British authorities in dealing with this matter is the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Iran and not only Britain but most of the western world with theAyatollah KhomeinideposingMohammad Reza Pahlaviand the ongoing hostage situation at the US Embassy in Tehran, and thus the British having no sway with the Iranians even in this matter affecting their own nationals, namely the hostages. In what ends up being the six day siege, this docudrama focuses on three different players on the British side, they representing three different organizations who may have a different agenda from each other. One isMax Vernonof the Metropolitan Police, he who becomes the main liaison between the British authorities as a collective and Salim, the lead hostage taker, and who is operating on a premise of negotiating in good faith. Two is Lance CorporalRusty Firminof the Special Air Services (SAS) of the British Army, the SAS which has set up in the adjacent building ready to storm the embassy at a moment's notice. Of the soldiers assigned, Rusty is seen as the one akin to a street fighter, with the tenacity to get the job done, his enthusiasm sometimes overshadowing what he is taught as tactical procedure. And three is BBC on-air reporterKate Adiewho is among the throng of reporters monitoring the action down the street on the other side of the proverbial yellow tape and who tries to get as much of an advantage over her fellow reporters as possible.—Huggo News reports discuss the growth in international terrorism because a willingness to negotiate with terrorists and offer concessions that give terrorist organizations perceived legitimacy.

Katie wonders what Margaret Thatcher will be willing to concede to the terrorists.High command meets late that night in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A on Whitehall Street with Secretary William Whitelaw (Tim Pigott-Smith) presiding. Whitelaw insists that British law will be followed. Whitelaw learns that the Iranians refuse to release anyone from jail and that Colonel Mike Rose (Robert Portal) of the SAS has quickly drawn up an assault plan that will likely be bloody.

A radio reports discusses that the police remain in charge of the situation but few details have been disclosed to the general public. The newspaper reports that the Iranians have blamed the West for the situation. The negotiators are frustrated that the terrorists called the BBC and the press is aware of the terrorists demands. There is the belief they cannot be successful negotiating through the press.
The SAS team prepares to storm the building just before noon despite a lack of intelligence about the situation they face. The terrorists call the negotiator's desk. The negotiators try to tell the terrorists that Teheran is considering their demands but learn that the terrorists have already called Teheran. The Iranians have told the hostages they are welcomed as martyrs to the great Islamic State of Iran.

Gullan devises a new plan where the hostages and terrorists are provided a bus and transported to Heathrow. There the SAS team plans to rescue the hostages from the bus. The team is taken off site to rehearse the assault and discovers great risks to their own personal safety. News reporter Katie Adie notices the team being trucked off the site and reports to the public that the military is in place working alongside the police. While the media reports on the lack of police contact with hostages and speculates on the effectiveness of the negotiation methods employed, the SAS team continues to drill on the bus assault to gain control in less than six seconds.Then it is decided that no bus will be provided for the terrorists and they will not be transported to Heathrow Airport comparing the failed attempt of the Germans at the Munich Olympics hostage situation. Colonel Rose points out that the SAS team has never operated on English soil and that the job asked of them to perform a rescue in a stronghold is fraught with risk.Meanwhile the Arab League has agreed to help with negotiations but the Prime Minister insists that the United Kingdom will not be seen as a soft target for terrorists. British law will be upheld and the terrorists will never leave the country. Max believes they must offer the terrorists something tangible in hopes the terrorists feel they have achieved something and give up.Members of the SAS team climb onto the roof of the embassy to further plan their assault. They see thehostages through the skylight. The passage allows for a perfect opportunity for a distraction charge that Roy will deliver. Roy promotes Rusty to be the leader of the team and gives him the mission codes.Rose describes a plan to the political leadership where the SAS team enters through the skylight under the cover of darkness and neutralizes the terrorists as they sleep. The politicians are aghast that the SAS will be labeled an assassination squad.

Roy gets Firmin's promotion to team leadership approve by Gullan. Salim calls again, demanding to speak with the ambassadors. Max stalls for time saying it is difficult to organize their participation. Salim demands the army stop prowling on their roof and walls. The sounds outside disappear. Salim then demands to speak to the BBC, and Max reluctantly agrees, but urges Salim to release another hostage. Salim tells Max how his people are tortured and oppressed by the Persians. Afterwards, Salim releases another hostage. The hostage tells Gullan that the terrorists are making plans to kill all the hostages if their demands are not met.Meanwhile the press portrays hope for a peaceful ending. The political leadership approve the immediate implementation of the SAS deliberate action plan as soon as there is proof of murder.On Day 5, the SAS practices their assault on the embassy on a mock-up of the floorplan constructed in a barracks. The caretaker (Ajay Vasisht) of the embassy building is invited to the site and points out their errors in the floorplan reproduction. The Prime Minister and the Arab League remain at loggerheads limiting the League's participation. The Iraqis offer to help but British intelligence learns Sami Mohammed Ali, an Iraqi operative, likely smuggled the weapons into the United Kingdom in diplomatic bags. One day prior to the attack, Ali fled the country.Salim calls Vernon again. Vernon assures Salim that his demands will be read out in full on the BBC at 6:00 p.m. that evening. Salim says failure to follow through will lead to one hostage being killed every half hour. Inside, Trevor Lock tells the BBC reporter Sim Harris (Sam Snedden) who also being held that he feels like an animal being readied for slaughter and is considering his options in using his weapon.As 6:00 p.m. approaches, the SAS team moves into place. The local BBC News only delivers a headline regarding the terrorists' demand for an airplane to leave the country. The phone rings and Max hesitantly answers it. To his surprise, Salim thanks him for his efforts and offers to release two hostages. Only then does Max learn that the BBC World Service has broadcast the terrorists' statement in full, giving the reason for their actions as the oppression by the Iranian government in Arabistan.Katie Abie reports that two hostages were released. The SAS team stands down. Back in their quarters, Firmin suggests that the SAS team missed their chance to free the hostages but implies the challenge still lies ahead of them.On Day 6, Faisal Jaseem berates an Iranian hostage of his leader's responsibility for murdering. his people. Faisal threatens to make an example of him. Katie Adie reports that Radio Teheran is reporting that an assault is imminent though British spokesmen say negotiations are ongoing. PC Trevor Lock is separated from the other hostages. Firmin spends his time studying the faces of the terrorists and the hostages learning who should not be shot. He compares his own background to that of Faisal stating he believes if Faisal is backed into a corner, he will fight his way out with nothing to lose. Lock places a call to Vernon and tells him that a hostage is tied up downstairs and believes the terrorists will kill him if their demands are not met.Salim grabs the phone and demands a bus and the ambassadors to take them to the airport immediately. Faisal has tired of all the talking and blames the Iranian leader Khomeini for killing his countrymen. The hostage says that he welcomes his own death if it leads to Faisal's death. Despite Salim's pleas, Faisal shoots the hostage in the head three times. The SAS team get word from Hector Gullan that shots have been fired in the embassy. Max asks Salim if a hostage was killed. Salim responds that they have 30 minutes to meet the terrorists demands or more hostages will be killed and tells Max they can collect the body. Firmin suggests that the negotiators have Salim on the telephone to give the assault team the maximum amount of time to breech the building.With that, Home Secretary Whitelaw authorizes the SAS operation and control of the operation is signed over to the regiment. The Prime Minister instructs Colonel Rose that no blockage or smokescreen should be created to block the television cameras so that the world and British people can see how the British government deals with terrorists. Vernon is instructed to do anything to stall or distract the terrorists from the assault.Vernon calls Salim to discuss buses with Salim while Roy lowers the distraction charge down the light tube. Salim knows Vernon is lying. The press sees movement of SAS team on the roof and around the building. Roy reports the distraction charge is in place. Salim tells Vernon that the bus must have curtains and that Max must drive the bus. He then hands off the phone to Lock. Lock tells max he finds it unbelievable that the government is giving in to the demands of the hostages. Max tells Lock he has his demands from the government.Meanwhile, SAS agents have lowered themselves on ropes to enter the upper story through the windows and race ladders to their placement on the ground. An agent puts his foot through a window causing Salim to become suspicious and leave the telephone. The distraction charge is exploded. The press and police race for cover.Firmin's team places explosives on the front balcony to gain entrance. Firmin has to improvise when one agent gets hung up in the ropes and a selected placement of an explosive would kill the man. The SAS enter the building. Sim Harris is among the first hostages to escape. The team begins working their way through the building clearing stairwells and rooms. Four female hostages are found and sent down the stairs. A blocked door requires Firmin to find an alternate entry into a room. He returns to the balcony and enters through an exterior window. He encounters a terrorist who shoots at him. Trevor Lock is found wrestling with Salim over his gun when agents break into the room and exterminate Salim. The SAS team comes upon a room full of hostages and kill three of the terrorists. While the hostages are being hustled outside, Firmin recognizes Faisal hiding among them and shoots him in the stomach before Faisal can detonate a grenade. Outside the Embassy, the hostages are detained and searched, revealing the sixth and last terrorist trying to hide among them, and he is arrested.During the assault, led by Firmin, Salim and four of the other terrorists are killed, at the cost of one of the hostages and none of the SAS men. Firmin's gun and the grenade he claimed from Faisal are bragged as evidence for the inquiry. A visibly shaken Vernon telephones his wife to reassure her that he is safe.

Jacob relates a story about his teddy bear Ishmael and Christina and he crack jokes about it until Jacob notes he is going to be late for work.Jacob heads to work. He is an air traffic controller. He is working with one other coworker who tells him there is currently nothing to land and heads off to get a snack. Jacob sees two men working on the terminals and learns of some tests that will put the terminals into security mode. He gets the call from AX 1-12 for permission to descend to 10,000 feet. Jacob tells it to wait for confirmation. A supervisor comes in and tells him of an extra flight EF 135 that had to divert to them due to bad weather. He tells Jacob to call the Pittsburgh tower. Jacob takes off his headphones while making the call but cannot get through. He goes back and gives AX 1-12 permission to drop to 10,000 feet. As he tries to make the call again, Jacob completely misses another plane that has popped up on the terminal screen; DH 616 that is slowly but surely crossing paths with AX 1-12Jacob calls EF 135 and tells them he can't get through to the Pittsburgh Airport. Meanwhile, on his other channel DH 616, is telling him they are getting warnings to descend but they need to know, but Jacob does not see or hear the warning. Looking at the screen, Jacob gives the order for AX 1-12 to descend to 6,000 feet, thus averting a collision. However, immediately after he takes off his headphones, DH 616, on not hearing a confirmation also begins to descend to 6,000 feetJacob gets a hold of Pittsburgh and gets the all clear about EHF 135. Going back to his terminal, he realizes AX 1-12 and DH 616 are in a collision course. He tries to call AX 1-12 to warn them, but gets no response. Suddenly, both planes disappear from the monitor. Jacob looks around in stunned horror. He knows what just happened.Jake is ushered into a conference room. His boss, Robert (Martin Donovan) confirms his worst fear; two planes collided at high altitude, with little chance of any survivors. Jacob immediately breaks down sobbing. ""How many dead? How many people were on those planes? Oh my god, how many people are dead?"" Jacob cries out. Robert tells him that they don't know why it happened, but he is, at this time, not being accused or blamed for what happened, and that they need him to keep it together, because they still need to do a full investigation.Meanwhile, Roman returns home, his house so much colder and lonely now his family will never set foot inside of it again.The next day, Jacob is debriefed on the steps he took on that fateful night. Robert begins to list off what Jacob did, minute by minute, including the fact, that due to Jacob not having his headphones on at one moment, he did not hear DH 616 was planning to descend. Jacob is escorted to his car by his lawyer who tells him not to call anyone, speak to anyone, or even leave his house. The lawyer tells him he will call Jacob tomorrow and to be strong.Jacob returns home, and sees his wife watching the news coverage about the crash. He goes inside and hugs his wife.Roman watches the news coverage, with the total dead standing at 271. Eve Sanders calls him again, checking on his well being, and suggesting he come to the Family Center. Instead, Roman hangs up and drives to the crash site. Roman lies and says he is with another man (as they don't want direct family members helping) and suits up to help go through the wreckage. He looks around, stunned by the carnage. He looks inside one intact piece of a plane and sees several dead bodies strapped in. Walking into a stretch of forest, he looks around until he finds a pearl necklace that belonged to his daughter, Nadiya. He calls out her name until he sees the unthinkable; a row of seats lodged in a tree. One of the bodies still strapped in is the body of his only child. Roman holds her in his arms, sobbing as other technicians surround him.Roman is taken back to where the bodies being held, sitting in the middle between his wife and daughter, refusing to leave their side, completely heartbroken.Christina comes home to see a news van parked out on her street. She sees her son Samuel playing outside and chides him for being outside without anyone. Samuel tells her he hasn't seen his dad all day. Christina and Samuel go back into the house. KILLER and MURDERER have been spray painted on the walls. The news is out, and the public has their scapegoat.Christina finds her husband in bed, catatonic.Roman goes the grave of his family, laying flowers for his wife, daughter, and unborn grandchild. Hours later, a groundskeeper finds Roman passed out at the grave. The man reluctantly tells him to leave, saying every time he catches Roman there he gets in trouble. Roman apparently has been staying overnight in the cemetery, still enveloped deeply in grief.Meanwhile, Jacob is becoming an insomniac, unable to sleep, and obsessively watching the news that debates his guilt. His son comes in and says hes hungry, so Jacob begins to cook some eggs. Christina comes into the kitchen and tells him they had a deal of watching no news. Jacob pulls the eggs on his sons plate, barely cooked. It is clear that he is losing it. Christina throws the eggs away, telling Jacob they are raw, while Jacob argues with her, causing them to smash a plate. Samuel, confused about what is happening, begins to whimper. Christina tries to comfort him, and then lays down the law with her husband.This stops now, she says. ""You can do this however you have to, but you don't get to do it to him, okay?""Jacob says they were making breakfast, but Christina ushers her son out of the room back to bed. Jacob tells her to get back in the kitchen but she ignores him.Roman watches old home movies of his family, having nothing else.Someone knocks at the door. It is Tessa Corbett (Hannah Ware), a journalist. She doesn't want to bother him, but wants to show him a few articles she has written. She plans to write a book about the accident and would like to ask him a few questions later. She tells him she will check back later. Roman takes the articles and begins to read them. Later, his co-worker Matt comes by to check in on him, trying to make sure he is okay. Matt makes semi awkward ""are you okay"" talk but Roman takes it in stride, knowing there is no easy way to talk about what happened. He notes that perhaps he needs to get organized and back to work, and spend less time at the cemetery. However, his family is there, they can never leave, and he has no other way to be close to them. He knows he has things to take care of right now, and tells Matt he needs to get going. Matt says he will leave him to it, and to take care of himself.Christina talks to Jacob, telling him that Samuel and she will spend some time with her sister, so he will have some time to recover and find himself again. If they don't do this, their relationship will continue to erode to the point it cannot be fixed. So they will do this for the sake of their son and their marriage. Jacob ultimately agrees for the sake of his son.Roman stares at pictures of his family.Jacob goes to a gun store and searches the aisles. After talking to a clerk, he buys a handgun, apparently in fear for his life. He watches cartoons in a haze. Returning to the airport, he besieged by reporters and barely gets inside. He is met by his lawyer and Robert. They tell him a trial is still not set but they will give him any legal representation he needs. Robert also once again recommends psychological counseling. They lay out two options; either he does administrative work, or he is given a severance package. If he picks the latter option, they strongly recommend he goes into hiding with a new name in new town. Jacob balks as his wife and family live in town and they cannot just quickly move. However, Robert and the lawyer ask him to think about what is truly best for his family.Roman meets with lawyers James Gullick (Larry Sullivan) and John Gullick (Kevin Zeigers) who represent the airline. Despite Roman suing without a lawyer or signing into a class action lawsuit, the lawyers plan to offer him a settlement all the same. Roman tries to speak, but James continuously interrupts him, telling him that in exchange for Roman dropping his lawsuit, he will be paid $160,000 in compensation for the deaths of his family, along with other benefits. It is clear the airlines hope that the money will shut up the families, and leave them free not to take any public responsibility for what happened. Roman, finally getting to speak, tells the men that he wants someone to apologize for the accident and the death of his family. He tells them to look at a photo of his wife and daughter. The lawyers are unmoved, and the smug, condescending John Gullick tells Roman that if he does not sign, he will not get a penny, something Roman will need in his situation. Roman gets up from his seat, and orders John to look at the photo. ""Look at this photo, because you didn't before. LOOK AT IT!"" Roman screams. John does so begrudgingly, and without emotion. Roman walks out.Jacob is meeting with a shrink, who asks him to go over positive thoughts he has had in the past week. Jacob replies that he had hoped to get his prescription refilled. Jacob does not actually want to talk about what happened, hoping to stay in a chemically induced haze. The shrink pushes, so Jacob tells him he doesn't feel good about anything. So, just give me the fucking pills, please, Jacob snaps. ""Or I'll go down the street and rob the goddamned pharmacy.""Roman looks at his wall of photos, now also filled with newspaper clippings with debate on whether Jacob will be held accountable for the crash.Jacob, in his apartment, stares at his bottle of pills, and begins to shove a handful into his mouth, sobbing. He grimaces in pain, and falls to the floor. He shoves a finger into his mouth, throwing up the pills.Roman goes to buy some alcohol. He drives to his construction site and walks around. He goes to the roof, debating whether to jump or not. We see a short scene of one of the planes falling out of the sky, on fire.ONE YEAR LATERIt is the one year anniversary of the accident. Roman is attending a memorial service at the crash site. Large steel balls have been placed in various distances around the crash site as metaphorical markers of those lost there. Standing by one, Roman is approached by Andrew Berg (Christopher Darga) the man he passed in the airport lobby the night of the crash, who had lost his wife and in-laws in the crash. It turns out the story about Nadiya's necklace inspired the monuments design. Andrew asks Roman what he should do to keep himself occupied, as all he can think about is his family, and every attempt to stay busy fails. Roman says it will take time, but he will find something that will help him get out of bed. Andrew asks if he has gotten through it. Roman stays silent.We cut to a travel agency. Jacob, now under the name Pat Dealbert is working there planning a cruise for a couple. After work, he goes home to a lifeless apartment, alone and away from his family.Roman is working on a mans fence as a side job. The man offers him a beer, and Roman takes it. The man offers him his weekly pay, but Roman declines until he finishes the job. The man then says if he liked the fence his wife picked out he would be happy. The man winces and sighs, walking away, immediately realizing he said the wrong thing to Roman.Roman waits outside a building for Tessa. He wants to ask her for a favor; to find Jacob. If the airline wont give him apology, he wants one from Jacob.Tessa leaves a message for Jacob, using his new name, asking to meet. In a bar, she tells him the book is basically ready, but she wants to give him a chance to add anything he would like to say. Jacob takes a moment and responds:""You know, sometimes I, sometimes I put myself in their shoes. You know, the families? And then I think about my son and my wife, and it scares me to death, its terrifying. I mean, what can I say? You know, I, I just want this pain inside of me to go away. So, tell them: Look I'm not a bad person? Right?""Tessa looks on stoically.Jacob leaves work for the weekend and goes to buy groceries, heading home. Roman is at work, when he gets a call from Tessa, saying she found Jacob. Apparently feeling that Jacobs response was not good enough, she has decided to let Roman know where he is.Tessa meets with Roman at a coffee shop and tells him that Jacob sold his house, moved to another state, and works at a travel agency. Roman asks for his address, and Tessa pauses, rightfully afraid Roman is going to inflict harm against Jacob. Roman tries to assuage her fears; he just wants to look Jacob in the eye, show him a photo of his family, and have him apologize.""No one has said they're sorry"", Roman says. ""No one.""Tessa gives him the address and Jacobs new name. Roman wants to give her something, but Tessa walks out, telling him goodbye. Roman begins to drive.Jacob is at home, making dinner when the doorbell rings. He goes to the drawer, looking at his gun. He opens the door. It is his wife and son, staying for the weekend. Later that night, they discuss his new identity, and how Samuel understands it. Christina asks how he is feeling and Jacob says alone, and his days vary between great and awful. Jacob misses his family, and asks Christina to move Samuel and her to him to start over. Christina tells him they need to take it slow. Jacob reluctantly agrees. They sleep together on the same bed, so they can be together as a family.The next morning, Christina wakes up and begins to clean herself up in the bathroom.Roman arrives at the apartment. Finding his apartment, he rings the doorbell. Christina answers the doorbell, but finds no one there.Roman sits in a hotel room, thinking of his family and finding them dead. He looks out the window. Jacobs apartment is just across the street. He drives off.Jacob is having game night with his family. As his wife is getting his son into pajamas, the doorbell rings, and he answers it. Roman is there, waiting for him. He shows Jacob the photo and asks him to apologize. Jacob pushes Roman away, saying he cannot be here, as his family is inside. He tells Roman it was an accident and he ""Didn't kill anybody"" and that Roman has lost his mind. As Roman looks down on the photo Jacob threw to the floor by accident, he hears Jacob is about to call the police. During all this, Jacob still hasn't the human decency to try and say that he is sorry, the ONLY thing Roman wanted. That, finally, pushes Roman over the edge.In a rage, Roman runs into Jacob, stabbing him several times in the chest, and once in the neck. As Jacob begins to bleed out, he goes for his gun in the drawer, only for Roman to shut it. As Christina and Samuel see Jacob and recoil in horror, Roman calls them Olena and Nadiya, hallucinating they are his family. He sits down next to them as they sob uncontrollably, holding the picture of his family. We see a close up of Jacob, dead from the stab wounds.We cut to a prison. Roman is in jail for Jacob's murder, but he seems at peace despite his surroundings. Ten years pass, and Roman is met by his lawyer. His case has been appealed due to the extenuating circumstances of his case. He could be paroled in four months time. He would have to see a psychiatrist several times a week and have consistent positive reports, but he soon could be free.We next see Roman leaving prison. He sits at a bus stop alone, no one to get him. He gets on a bus and heads to the cemetery to visit his family once more. A man walks behind him, wearing a black sweatshirt. Roman places his daughters necklace on the grave. The young man walks up to Roman, and asks for directions to the exit of the cemetery. Roman offers him directions out. As they walk together, Roman notes nothing has changed in the 11 years since he has been there. Roman asks the man if he has family in the cemetery. The man replies that ""No, my father isn't buried here."" Roman immediately stops, knowing who it is. It's Jacob's now adult son, Samuel.Samuel pulls out a gun, intending to kill Roman. Roman tells him to go ahead. ""Do what you have to do. I understand,"" Roman says. However, Roman tells him that he is sorry for what he did (something Jacob was unable to do, the very act that could have prevented his death). Samuel, breaking down says he changed his mind, and that he is not going to kill Roman. ""It's not what I was taught,"" he says. Samuel tells Roman to go, as he continues to sob. Roman leaves the cemetery alive, but now must spend the rest of his life dealing with the aftermath of ""his"" crime."

When Usue begins to yell at them for killing her ""friend"" the boys tease her about her dead mother who they insist is in Hell for committing suicide. A scuffle ensues and the children chase one another to the gates of the forge. Benito refuses to give Usue her doll back and when the girl punches him square in the face he rips the head off it and tosses it over the gate before the two boys run home.On their way back, the boys come across the blacksmith who appears to be foraging in the clearing where they originally found Usue. Deciding not to heed his friend's warnings of the rumors surrounding the smith and his penchant for kidnapping and eating children, Benito tries to hit him with rocks. When one strikes the smith, the boys run but Benito is struck in kind by a stone, falls to the ground, and is nearly captured before being released.When Benito and Usue return home they are chastised for their shenanigans and it's revealed that Mateo and the woman from the church are Usue's guardians.Back at the inn, Santi and his friends pore over a letter found in the agent's belongings which points towards the blacksmith being in possession of the lost chest of gold seen at the beginning of the film - revealing the agent's true reasons for being there. When Alfredo arrives and threatens to report their snooping to the government, he manages to convince three of them to accompany him back to the forge to confront the smith.Refusing to join them beyond the gate, the agent remains outside as the three armed men break the chain and hesitantly make their way to the forge - passing through fields of handmade metal crucifixes. When the smith refuses to open the door and allow them entry the men prepare to force their way in but one of the three accidentally steps backwards into a bear trap and misfires his rifle. The smith suddenly appears armed with a large metal shield, hammer, and metal mask and scares away two of the three men. Approaching the third still stuck in the bear trap, the smith releases his foot but the man scampers away in panic, trips, and falls head-first into another - killing him. Believing the smith to have killed their friend, the men rush back to the village to tell everyone what they had seen.Meanwhile, Usue fetches water from a nearby well and is teased by two girls who - just like Benito and his friend - claim that her mother is burning in Hell for hanging herself. After splashing water on them and striking one in the face, Usue rushes home and asks Mateo if it's true that her mother is being eternally punished for committing suicide - a belief the priest admits is true but his attempts to console the girl fail and Usue storms out - making her way back to the forge in an attempt to retrieve the head of her doll.When Usue witnesses the smith disposing the body of the man who fell in the bear-trap she hides and finds her way into his forge. Hearing what sounds like the whimpers of a child, Usue investigates to find a small boy locked inside a suspended metal cage. The boy pleads with her to retrieve the key from the blacksmith's belt and free him and after some hesitation she decides to help. Waiting until the smith has drunken himself to sleep, Usue steals the keys and frees the boy - following him as he picks up a pitch-fork and leers over the sleeping blacksmith, ready to strike.The boy suddenly transforms into a demon and the smith awakens - a struggle ensues and both the demon and Usue attempt to flee the forge. The demon is caught by another bear-trap while Usue twists her ankle and falls to the ground - knocking herself unconscious on a rock. The smith emerges from the forge and hits the demon with his hammer - breaking off one of his horns and subduing him. As the smith retrieves the girl an onlooking Benito witnesses the scene and runs back to the village - thinking that Usue has been killed.The demon back inside his cage, the smith tortures him with hot pokers and a crucifix. When the demon reminds the smith that he went back on their agreement and still owes him his soul in exchange for being able to survive the war and return to his wife, the smith dismisses it by saying that things didn't happen as he wanted (namely that his wife hung herself shortly after his return home).When Usue awakens back inside the forge, the smith enters the room and demands to know who she is and why she was there. Clearly frightened by the previous events, the smith realizes he needs to take a softer, kinder approach and does his best to fix up Usue's twisted ankle before leaving her to rest more. Usue, however; sneaks out of the room and finds the blacksmith and devil as he continues to torture and berate the hellspawn. Fascinated by the demon, Usue approaches and asks if he's the Devil - to which the smith explains that he's not THE Devil but rather a lesser demon called Sartael. When the girl asks Sartael if he's seen her mother in Hell, the demon teases her just as the other children did before the smith intervenes.The smith then shows Usue the various ways in which he tortures Sartael and lets the girl participate - ringing a small blessed bell that hurts the demon's ears and pouring a pot of chickpeas onto the ground which the smith explains relates to every demon's weakness to compulsively count every single one. After having their fun, the smith suggests the girl return home and offers to escort her back to the village.As this is occurring, the village people have begun to panic as first the men from earlier return claiming that the smith killed their friend and later Benito claims that he either has taken captive or has killed Usue. Alfredo authorizes the villagers to form an armed mob and storm the forge in order to bring the smith to justice by any means necessary. This mob, led by Alfredo, Santi, and Mateo meet the smith and Usue on the road just beyond the gates to the forge. Demanding that the smith release the girl, the mob attacks the him even after he complies and despite Usue's cries for them to stop.Alfredo instructs the mob to take the smith prisoner and bring him along as they still intend to find the chest of gold he supposedly has in his possession. At this point in the film several hints had been dropped that Usue is the smith's daughter and one of the villagers asks Mateo if the rumors about this are true. Mateo reveals that Usue is not the smith's daughter but she is the daughter of the smith's late wife. The priest recounts the story of how he came into possession of Usue...One night years ago the smith - whose name is Patxi - visited Mateo to deliver a new church bell but instead gave the priest a baby to look after. Patxi then explained to the priest what had happened upon his return home from the war. Escaping certain death, Patxi deserted the army and returned to the village after two years away from home to find his wife with a child that could not be his. Believing a rumor that Patxi had been killed, his wife had found comfort in the arms of another man and ended up having a child with him. Enraged, Patxi threatened to kill the baby by holding it over a fire (explaining Usue's burn scars on her face) but he chooses instead to take his anger out on the child's father - killing him. Overcome with grief, Patxi's wife (and Usue's mother) commits suicide by hanging. Leaving the baby with Mateo, Patxi returned to his forge and never ventured out again - becoming a mysterious recluse.Entering the forge the group comes upon the imprisoned Sartael and are frightened and amazed by the demon. Mateo expresses his desire to take Sartael to the Vatican in order to indisputably prove the existence of Hell - and by extension Heaven and God - as well as earn whatever accolades he may from single-handedly proving the beliefs of Christianity right.Alfredo - who surprisingly doesn't seem affected by Sartael's existence - shepherds Mateo and the others back outside to leave him and two men alone with Patxi in order to interrogate him about the chest of gold. At one point, Sartael attempts to make a deal with Alfredo to secure his release but the agent approaches and reveals himself to be a greater demon named Alastor in disguise.Alastor explains that he's there to claim Patxi's soul and berates the lesser demon for his ineptitude in doing it himself. He informs Sartael that their superiors in Hell plan to demote him for his incompetence and that someone will along eventually to collect him after Patxi is dealt with.As the men attempt to get the location of the gold out of an uncooperative Patxi, an impatient Alastor orders them to hang him until he dies. Usue, who has managed to sneak her way into the forge makes a deal with Sartael - his freedom in return for saving Patxi's life and finding her mother in Hell. Sartael tells her to ring the blessed bell to distract Alastor long enough for her to free him. When she does this, Alastor reels in pain and begins to reveal his demonic identity.Panicked by the sight, the two men release Patxi and one shoots Alastor before they flee - running headlong into Santi and the other villagers who've broken down the forge's door. Patxi's life saved, Sartael pleads with Usue to set him free and make good on their deal - when she does he flees, revealing his intention to not make good on his end of the bargain. Unfortunately for Sartael though, as he leaves the forge he falls into another bear-trap and seized upon by villagers who begin to beat him mercilessly.Mateo - who has re-entered the forge - strikes Usue for setting the demon free and curses her to Hell to join her mother. When Alastor recovers from his wounds, Usue approaches him and makes a deal: her soul in exchange for him taking her to her mother. Alastor agrees and transforms into his gigantic true demonic form and skewers the girl with his pitch-fork.When Patxi awakens he realizes what has happened and finds Sartael (still being beaten by the villagers). Patxi makes one final deal with the demon: he can finally have his soul but he must help save Usue's. Admitting that he did like the girl, Sartael agrees. Patxi prepares for the task by loading a cart with a giant church bell which turns out to be entirely made of gold - the same gold from the chest at the beginning of the film which the blacksmith had melted down. Giving the demon his pitch-fork back, Patxi allows Sartael to kill him.Patxi suddenly finds himself among a throng of frightened and distraught people who're being herded through the fiery gates of Hell by demons like Sartael on all sides. Despite the demons' commands to hurry and get inside, Patxi searches among the mass of souls for Usue who he finds hesitating at the entrance. As Alastor approaches, Usue empties a jar of chickpeas to distract him while Patxi uses the giant golden bell to subdue the massive demon and return Usue's soul to the world of the living.After Usue awakens - revived - Sartael suddenly appears and warns the villagers who've gathered around her to treat her like a saint lest he must return to terrorize them all. The demon than scampers away.As the film closes, Sartael runs through the woods and suddenly disguises himself as a young man - flagging down a passing cart for a ride. When the man driving the cart asks him what his story is, Sartael attempts to deflect the man's interest by telling him it's a long story. The man informs him that the next village is far away and a long story would be more than welcome.Meanwhile, back at the gates of Hell, Patxi uses the bell once more to force back open the doors and enters - intent on finding his wife."

Clinical,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5577742/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychiatrist tries to put her life back together after a violent attack by seeking to repair the life of a new patient, but he has his own terrifying history. The film Opens with Dr. Jane Mathis (Vanessa Shaw), a trauma psychiatrist, working late into the evening hours (with Holiday music playing in the background) calling in prescription updates and performing patient checkup calls. Alone in her building, she sees the clock approaching midnight and goes to brew a pot of coffee when she hears a loud crashing sound from down the hall. She walks into the waiting room to see her patient, Nora (India Eisley), cutting her own wrists and hands with a shard of glass. Nora tells Mathis that she ""Did what she told her to do..."" and that she was wrong, then proceeds to attack Mathis with the shard of glass and then slits her own throat.
Fast forward two years. The scene opens with Dr. Mathis, apparently still dealing with the trauma of the attack, sitting in her car outside of her own therapist's office taking a prescription pill with coffee. She is seeing a friend and fellow therapist, Terry (William Atherton), to recover from the event, but her sessions are void of true emotion and guarded. She expresses to Terry that she wants to resume helping people who are recovering from traumatic events but then confesses that she is not ready to ""go see Nora"" yet (which tells the viewer that Nora is not dead) and then changes the subject. She also mentions that she's began a relationship which seems to impress Terry.
Mathis sees quite a few patients in her home, but not those suffering from Trauma. The montage that presumes shows a bored and disconnected Mathis with her patients, doodling on her notepad rather than making notes and being frustrated with the lack of stimulation. One patient in particular glances at her prescription pad on the coffee table and requests something for anxiety. She tells the patient to try a few more sessions before she is willing to write a prescription (insinuating that she is now against prescribing meds to her patients). A new patient, who identifies himself simply as Alex, calls Dr. Mathis and begs her take him on as a post trauma patient and she agrees. That evening she self-medicates (notably not needing the water that she had turned the facet on in the bathroom to swallow) and goes to bed with the TV on. She awakes in the middle of the night to a crashing sound outside and goes to investigate. She discovers her trash can pushed over and while picking up the contents sees the bushes outside her house rustle. Walking towards the bushes to see the cause a figure flashes by and footsteps are heard running off, away from the house. She resumes cleaning up the spilled trash. Over her shoulder, Nora appears on the porch behind her but Mathis doesn't see her. She is gone when Mathis turns around and re-enters her home.
Alex shows up to Jane's house for his first session, commenting on how he appreciates her lack of holiday decor. His face is terribly disfigured and he expresses frustration with his previous therapists and psychiatrists in general and that he doesn't see himself when he looks in the mirror. Alex states that he'd like something for his anxiety but Mathis refuses to prescribe him anything stating that drugs make things worse and that she isn't like the others and cares about the patients first. She states that she believes talking and exposing the issues that are affecting her patients helps the most.
Later (presumably the next day) Jane and her friend Clara(Sydney Tamiia Poitier) go for a jog and Jane sees Nora in the woods along the side of her trail and becomes unnerved. Later Clara expresses to Jane that she's happy that Jane has resumed their jogging routine and states she's proud of her for her progress. The camera pans out and you see the two conversing from behind a tree, as if they are being watched, and can hear labored breathing. Later that evening Jane is home eating dinner with her boyfriend Miles (Aaron Stanford), a police officer, when he notices that she isn't eating. She blames the time of year but is remembering the scene in the woods in her mind during the discussion and the two joke about therapy to get work off their brains.
Alex returns for a visit and explains that while shopping one day a child stared at him and made him feel like a freak. Alex talks about receiving a new face and how he doesn't feel like himself. Dr. Mathis tells him he needs ""exposure therapy"" to return to the accident and confront what happened to him. Alex tells Mathis he was on his way from work when he came upon a vehicle that had crashed but then states his memory is fractured and has a panic attack, failing to revisit the entire event. Dr. Mathis brings him out of the attack and teaches him a breathing exercise to use when he has attacks.
Mathis re-tells a nightmare she had to Terry on her next visit about Nora and explains that when she work up, she felt, ""heavy"". Terry questions her about sleep paralysis and offers a script which she declines. He questions Mathis about her lack of progress, telling her that she is keeping something from him. She confesses that she has taken on a trauma patient that had been disfigured a few years ago and Terry reprimands her for taking on such a case. She tells Terry that trauma patients are what she's good at and she feels she's already helping Alex. That night Mathis is lying in bed when she hears crashing sounds from downstairs and calls Miles for help. She investigates to discover a sleepwalking Alex in her home and slaps him to wake him up. She declines to press charges against him but refuses to see Alex anymore as a patient despite his pleas and asks Miles to spend the night with her. She has a dream about Nora's first session where she asks if anyone would know that she was seeing her as a patient (which Mathis assures her that no one would) and then wakes up in an episode of sleep paralysis. This startles Miles, which Jane then explains and that she's ok, however for the remainder of the evening Jane fails to sleep and has flashbacks of the incident with Nora.
No longer seeing Alex, Jane resumes therapy with her other patients (as well as her seemingly frustrated and disconnected disposition to them) until right before Christmas. Miles brings a tree to Jane's house which she and Miles decorate. He tells Jane that she can talk to him about anything and that it isn't going to scare him off. As they share a moment Jane's phone rings with Alex on the line, he tells her that he has taken too many pills and she rushes out to see him. Alex lets her into his home and appears disoriented from taking too many sleeping pills. He tells Mathis that he doesn't want to ""live like this"" and that he ""keeps thinking about her"" and then passes out. Mathis gives Alex a shot which brings him to consciousness but also makes him ill. He begs Mathis to not give up on him and assumedly she agrees as they resume sessions. The next session he tells Mathis the breathing exercises are helping and admits he had taken the pills in an attempt to commit suicide and not just to sleep. They attempt to relive the accident but Alex stops. Mathis comes close to telling him about Nora but stops herself and Alex storms out mid-session. That evening Mathis later takes more pills while drinking a glass of wine when Alex calls and apologizes for storming out. They agree to have another session the following week. That evening Nora shows up at Mathis's house, luring her outside, then entering the house and turning on her Christmas music before running off. Mathis then visits the mental institution where Nora had been held and she was advised that Nora had been released. The Dr. at the hospital tells Mathis that Nora's father died a couple years ago so there was no one to notify that she had been released. Mathis watches a video of Nora's sessions where she tells the physician there that the night she had broken into Mathis's office she had confronted her abuser and describes what presumably was an additional rape by him.In Alex's next session Dr. Mathis tells Alex about Nora and why she doesn't prescribe drugs then they revisit Alex's the accident and he tells Dr. Mathis that he had stopped to pull two people out of a wrecked car when he was hit by a vehicle and that his daughter was in his own car when he had stopped, that she'd be alive if it wasn't for the fact that he had stopped to help with the wreck. The two cry and comfort each other.
That night Jane is trying to sleep and cannot, she goes through her bathroom cabinets and finds several empty boxes of meds (presumably to have taken them all) and is left with insomnia. While in the kitchen getting a snack she hears a noise and finds a window open with blood on it. She returns to her bedroom to see blood soaked all over her bed and calls the police (and Miles). They come and review her surveillance system in her home and discover it has been tampered with, several hours time having been deleted. Upon her next visit to Terry she expresses concern that she is afraid and hasn't been sleeping. Terry advises her to stay with him but she declines stating that she will be staying with Clara and asks for a glass of water. While Terry is in the other room Jane rips several prescription papers from Terry's prescription pad. She doesn't go to Clara's, but returns home with several prescriptions in hand to find an oblivious Alex on her front porch. She becomes agitated with Terry and advises him that she is not seeing patients. He states he was in the neighborhood and thought he'd visit, feeling that they had made a connection. She recommends Alex to Terry and goes inside, taking her prescriptions and then lies down on the couch, checking her cell phone to see several missed calls from Miles. She falls asleep. Sometime later, she has a nightmare that Nora is in her home attacking her, she awakes to find her lamp knocked over, the light flickering and Norma actually in her home. They have a scuffle in the kitchen and she plunges a cork screw into Norma's skull, killing her.
Sometime later she awakes in the same mental hospital that Nora had been held in, cuffed to the bed and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. She sees the attending physician that Nora had seen and Terry (who has come on her behalf). Terry tells her that her blood tests had come back and he asks her how long she had been taking prescriptions from his pad in which she responds with an apology. They show her the surveillance video of the evening in which she had killed Nora, where she discovers she had actually killed Miles (who had come to her home to check on her in response to all of her missed calls). Her Dr. tells her that Nora was found that day, having hung herself in her apartment.
Clara visits Nora in the hospital. When she gets into her car she is stunned by someone in the back seat. Meanwhile in the hospital Jane is having hallucinations and nightmares now about both Nora and Miles. In her next session she tells her Dr. that Nora drugged her and that she didn't drug herself and kill Miles. The Dr. responds with a recant of Nora's story about her treatment there and what she thought and didn't think. During his recant he re-mentions that she was ""convinced"" her father was dead, that SHE had killed him. In answering Jane's inquiry he admits that he had spoken to Nora's father and that he was paying for her treatment. She asks what Nora had done to her father, to his face, and he asks her how she knew? She realizes that Alex is both Nora's abuser and her father, and escapes from the hospital. When she reaches the parking lot she is electrocuted.
Jane comes to, tied up in her home with Alex interrogating her. He admits that HE was the one who snuck into her home and drugged her, causing her to hallucinate and kill Miles. Admitting that he wasn't actually injured in his car accident but that it was Nora who had cut up his face the night she broke into Jane's office and tried to commit suicide. He admits that he was Nora's abuser, blaming Mathis for the fact that Nora realized that he was her abuser and causing her to confront him Christmas eve two years prior and that the car accident was on purpose to cover up how he had initially been injured. He faked his own death to disassociate himself with Dora's case so that he could seek revenge on Mathis. Mathis frees her hands from the ropes and stabs Alex in the neck with an ornament from the tree. She's tied in and gets away upstairs where she finds the bodies of Terry and Clara. Alex talks to her through the door and breaks into the room. They fight and she escapes through the window, disfiguring Alex's face again with her fingernails as she falls the first floor.
She comes to on the lawn and re-enters the house to find Alex's lifeless body seated on the couch having succumb to his neck wound."

Next scene we see his family, wife, Sue (Cristina Serafini) and young daughter, Olivia (Lillian Blankenship) getting ready for a talent show. Olivia is handed the phone to talk to her dad, telling him, ""you'll love the show"" as Frank tells them a lie that he is on his way down to the garage in the elevator as he sits behind his desk at the law firm. After hearing that sentence Frank decides, this is the time to make a change, to leave and see his daughter perform. As he goes to the elevator the doors close and his boss/co-worker in the other room calls him over to discuss a case. Time speeds on and goes late into the evening, making Frank even later. We see Frank in traffic as the rain pours and his daughter performs on stage.Frank arrives at the performance hall and does not see his family. He calls them, but no response. He returns home. Calls Sue to apologize and tells her to please come home as it is getting late. Time speeds past and we see the clock tick as Frank waits for their return. Unfortunately it is the police car who approaches the door.
Frank is taken to a crime scene and the voices from the police fade out in the background as he walks up to the scene. Two bodies hugging each other in a ditch. It appears to be his wife and daughter. He screams and is held back by police.Frank shows up to the police station, asking the police chief Lustiger (Johnathon Schaech) what they are doing about the case. Lustiger is playing on his phone and is half answering Frank's questions. There is some information exchange about the area being covered by the Russian Mafia and gold fibers were found in the area. There are no leads and it appears the police force is doing nothing to advance the case. Frank gets upset with the situation and storms out angrily. In the hall he sees Officer Strode (Karl Urban) who asks him if he's ok. They exchange a word and Frank leaves the police station.Next shot is from overhead. Many black umbrellas surround the two coffins. Rain is pouring heavily. Frank is told by his father in law that he has heard enough and doesn't want to hear from Frank ever again, ""A nod is enough"". Frank goes to get drunk at a bar. He gets more and more drunk and finds himself at the backroom. There is a brawling cage with two fighters in the ring. Frank watches as he downs two other shots and starts a fight with a spectator.

We also see Frank fighting improve at the back of the bar brawls. And him growing to be silent.Frank returns to the crime scene in a nice black car. He parks under a bridge and walks to the area where the bodies were found looking for clues. He hears a tapping in the distance and notes that if he wasn't quiet he would not have been able to hear it, marking how much he has changed from before. Frank goes towards the sound and climbs up an antenna to a shack that has someone living there. He looks around and takes a few photos as he looks out of the windows. The windows have a perfect view of the area where his family was killed.Frank returns to his car and finds a group of 4 men trying to pry into his car. The men say Frank is in Russian territory and Frank can pay his dues by giving him his wallet and keys. The Russian man has a dog and was unclipped to release onto Frank, but the dog whimpers and backs off. The Russian man kicks the dog and chases the dog off. Frank says nothing and reaches to hand over his wallet. As he stretches out the wallet he also pulls his keys into his fist and attacks the tallest man. Fight scene occurs. Frank wins, he pulls out the photo of his wife and daughter and shows the main guy. He says nothing and searches the man's face to see if he recognizes them or is the killer - the Russian man is not. Frank takes a photo of him and knocks him out, but not before he is shot in the stomach by some other mobster. As his vision fades he is rescued by a woman.Frank wakes up shirtless in bed with the wound covered. [The wound happens on the left side, but later we see him being patched up on his right]. He says nothing to the woman as she explains that she, Alma (Paz Vega) is an ER nurse and volunteers in the area. He got lucky that the bullet was a clean entry and exit. Frank says nothing and leaves. Outside he sees the dog. The dog follows him and they both reach home.
Frank puts up the photo of the Russian mobster on his white board and crosses off the mobster's face.The doorbell rings and it is the ER nurse. She holds out his wallet saying that he left that and she still needs to change his bandages. She tells him that he speaks in his sleep and knows he can talk. But Frank still says nothing. He gives her the memorial invitation indicating that his family has died. Alma befriends him.Frank attempts to find the potential witness who lives in a makeshift shelter, but he loses him as he closes his door to his car and scares off the man. He goes to see Alma at her home, but she is not there. We see the next scene of Alma working in a hospital. There are a group of men who approach her saying that she needs to pay her dues. She says she is done and doesn't want to associate with them anymore. The man chokes Alma and tells her no. They leave. Frank turns the corner and shows up.
As he drives Alma home later, she reveals that the shelter Frank investigated was the home of a man called ""Mr. Shivers"" (Clint Dyer), who works as a cook at the local diner. After he drops Alma off, Russian gang members appear and ask Alma if she is going to continue supplying drugs to them. Frank suddenly appears and incapacitates them. She explains that she worked with them for a year, stealing drugs from the hospital for them. Frank takes her to his home for her safety.Cut to the beginning scene of Frank (we now know) fighting Shivers (we just met), dialogue saying to the audience ""So am I still crazy to you now?"". Frank finds Mr. Shivers working in the kitchen of a diner; they fight. Frank shows his family picture to Shivers, who witnessed the murders from his shelter. Shivers says that a police officer committed the murders. Frank sees in Shivers eyes that he recognized his family but does not see murder. Frank believes Shivers and runs out the backdoor as help arrives to the doors he blocked off. Frank then sneaks into the police station and finds that Hank Strode was assigned to patrol that particular district on the night of the murders.After several days of following Strode and switching cars following him, Frank maps out Strode's routine. He catches that Strode has a spare key behind a planter and enters Strode's house and finds a police jacket with gold fibers coming loose from an embroidered sleeve badge. As he looks further he sees a fake door, in the cubby-hole Frank also finds a bag that contains magazines with Frank on the cover, news articles about Strode's 12-year-old daughter's murder, and Frank's legal defense of the suspect, who was freed on a technicality. Frank sees a digital camera and turns it on. Inside are photos of Frank at the funeral and his family's birthday party. Frank realizes the gravity of the situation and leaves a message on Strode's car telling him to meet at the warehouse at 11 pm to get back the camera.As Strode arrives, a fight ensues, leaving both injured. Strode wanted Frank to suffer for freeing the suspect, and he wanted Frank to know what Strode felt. Frank overcomes his desire to kill him, remembering Aurelius' quote, ""The best revenge is to be unlike your enemy,"" and he then knocks Strode out.Later, we see news coverage of Strode's trial and conviction. The police department says that a bad cop put away is best. Frank and Alma visit the graves of his wife and daughter, where Frank finally ends his vow of silence by saying ""I love you"" to his family's graves."

Rememory,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2331047/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Gordon invents the Rememory machine that allows him to see memories as they actually were. He dies in his office. Is it murder? Sam investigates by using the machine ""borrowed"" from Gordon's wife. He looks at memories of others involved. Gordon Dunn, a famed scientific pioneer, is mysteriously found dead just after the unveiling of his newest work, a groundbreaking device able to extract, record and play a person's unfiltered memories. After his death, Gordon's reclusive wife, Carolyn, delves deeper into her own private world when a mysterious man shows up claiming to be from Gordon's past. With questionable motives he takes the machine and uses it to try and solve the mystery, beginning an investigation of memories that lead him down a path of guilt, grief, and betrayal to an unexpected answer. After losing his brother, Dash Bloom, in a car accident, the modelist, Sam Bloom, tries unsuccessfully to move on with his life. Sam Dash's last words to him. One day, he watches the lecture of a psychologist, Gordon Dunn, who has developed the prototype of a machine that records, erases and plays the memories of his subjects. Sam becomes obsessed with the scientist and stalks him at his hotel. When Gordon is murdered in his room, Sam has many suspects. He then meets Gordon ex-wife, Carolyn Dunn, who allows Sam to use the device to investigate each suspect. Will Sam find out the truth about who killed Gordon?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sam Bloom goes by various names/aliases throughout, including Peter and Sam, which is slightly confusing at first. Sam is interested in a psychologist (Gordon Dunn) developing technology to extract your memories, so you or anyone can watch them clear as day, like a film clip, but unbiased by your own perceptions. Sam, personally, wants to use the device to remember his brother's last words. Viewers see a flashback: Sam's brother was a rock star who returned home to visit him, but after some time at a local bar, was killed in a car accident with Sam at the wheel. It's not entirely clear who was at fault, as is often the case with car accident scenes, but there was another car involved. While stalking Dunn (hoping for help to view this memory) and waiting outside his office, the inventor gets killed inside - and this sparks intrigue into who killed him. The majority of the film, Sam plays detective. The gimmick is that Sam builds scale models and he builds a model for the murder and figurines for each character involved his investigation - primarily, patients in the test phase of the device, and co-workers at the company manufacturing the device for profit. Sam visits and befriends the inventor's wife, Carolyn, on false pretenses, stealing the actual device from Dunn's office in her home, and views memories already saved by the test subjects, as research. Sam follows up by meeting with each test subject, and asking test patient Todd, who met with Dunn in his final moments, to don the headpiece and record his memory of their interaction. Sam also utilizes the device in an ongoing attempt to extract his own memories. As a side effect of using the device, Sam begins to have hallucinations of his dead brother; it appears as though the brother is there with him. The test subjects report having hallucinations and worse - it seemed to them as though memories were crashing into the present reality; one of the subjects even committed suicide. Another test subject had an affair with Dunn, and, based on Todd's memory of his exit from Dunn's office, turns out to be the very last person to have entered Dunn's office - Wendy - only she is not forthright with Sam. Sam decides to enlist Carolyn's help in the case (it turns out she knew about the affair and who with), and sets up a meeting for the wife to confront the mistress, during which Carolyn persuades Wendy to don the headset and show her perception of Dunn's last moments. We view Wendy's memory: Dunn was already dead when she entered the office, so she stole the device and brought it to his home office, to find her own memory cards (which are on glass discs) and retrieve them, but she is interrupted by Carolyn and escapes unseen out the back door. As we know, Sam later stole the device from the same room, before Carolyn discovered it was there. Wendy agreed to share this memory in exchange for her own memory discs, which she is given, and gives Carolyn her husband Dunn's personal memory disc, which Wendy had still had in her pocket when she fled Dunn's home office. On a beach where she and Dunn had once had a wonderful family day with their deceased daughter, Carolyn watches her dead husband's final memories, as he viewed memories of their dead young daughter and deleted them; Carolyn and Sam discover Dunn was killed by trying to delete too many painful memories from his own brain - and the process itself killed him. Carolyn puts Dunn's memory disc in a glass bottle, presumably to throw into the ocean, like a message in a bottle. Sam offers her his own memory disc, while apologizing - he says she'll understand exactly who he is if she watches. Sam's disc contains the full car accident memory, from his perspective, in which Sam's brother was not the only victim - Dunn, Carolyn and their daughter were in the other car, and she was killed, prompting Sam to flee the scene. However, Carolyn takes it and immediately adds it to the bottle, because Sam has helped her find some answers, and throws it into the sea."

Du Qiu manages to crawl into the sewer in the nick of time, but the brilliant Yamura, having guessed Du Qiu's escape route, is already waiting there. Du Qiu manages to fight back and takes Yamura as hostage, using him as leverage to escape. On the road, Du Qiu insists that he's innocent. He eventually lets Yamura go and throws away his gun, which convinces Yamura that this case isn't as simplistic as it seems after all.Now Osaka's most wanted man, Du Qiu uses every trick up his sleeves to evade the police, hiding in any spot he can find. During his escape, he learns that a mysterious group has been using cash to bait homeless people into a black van and taking them away for good. Even though Du Qiu has successfully avoided capture, he suddenly finds himself the target for a group of assassins led by Rain and Dawn. Du Qiu realizes that this conspiracy reaches deeper into his life than he has ever imagined.With no one else to turn to, Du Qiu can only rely on Mayumi for assistance. With her help, the two manage to escape Osaka to Mayumi's farm in the countryside. Du Qiu asks Mayumi to provide an alibi and prove his innocence, but she refuses. She takes Du Qiu to the woods and reveals that her only reason for getting close to him is to get revenge for her pharmacist finance, who committed suicide three years ago. Mayumi believes that Du Qiu, who represented Tenjin in court, is the reason that her finance was framed and convicted. Just as she is about to pull the trigger, Dawn suddenly appears to kill them. Yamura arrives just as Du Qiu and Mayumi are surrounded by assassins, and he helps the pair fight off the assassins. The near-death ordeal makes the three change the way they see each other. Dawn, who injected a mysterious drug that enhanced her powers during the fight, dies just as Rain arrives to witness everything.Later, a suspicious Mayumi returns to the farm in search of evidence and accidentally finds a file that was hidden by her finance. Mayumi has believed all along that he is innocent, but the file reveals the truth about his involvement in a conspiracy involving Tenjin. Du Qiu finally unlocks the puzzle, which points to Sakai and his son being the mastermind behind the scenes. To prevent an even bigger tragedy from happening, Du Qiu puts his life on the line and goes to the pharmaceutical plant on his own.It turns out that the Sakai family's crimes are far worse than imagined - Tenjin Pharmaceuticals is actually the mysterious group that has been taking homeless people off the streets for their inhumane medical experiments. The company is trying to use the experiments for a dangerous drug that would turn humans into weapons of war and sell it to terrorist organizations. Du Qiu is taken by guards and becomes an unwilling participant in the experiment. He is eventually forced to fight Yamura, who has come to the plant to save him. However, Du Qiu manages to retain his free will with sheer will power, despite having been tortured and drugged. The two men team up and fight back against their captors. Rain, who was kept in the dark about Tenjin's plans all along, decides to turn her back against the company and join the two men in a fight to the death."

But who can be trusted?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil An unnamed getaway driver picks up a BMW for a bank robbery. En route to pick up the crew, he receives a call from his 13-year-old daughter Katie, and is unable to reach Clay, an associate who arranged the robbery. Driving the crew to the bank, the driver refuses to reveal his name, referring to himself as the ""Wheelman"". As the crew carry out the robbery, Wheelman receives a call from the ""Handler"" who apparently contracted the crew, instructing him to abandon the men once they place the money in the trunk, as they have been ordered to kill him at the drop-off. The Handler warns Wheelman not to answer any calls but his, and Wheelman drives off with the money, leaving the crew behind.On the Handler's instructions, Wheelman counts the stolen $230,000, unknowingly tailed by a motorcyclist.

Most Beautiful Island,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4866448/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Most Beautiful Island is a chilling portrait of an undocumented young woman's struggle for survival as she finds redemption from a tortured past in a dangerous game. There's little in the first half of Ana Asensio's feature-length directorial debut that foreshadows its outrageous second half, except maybe the credit for indie-horror distributor Glass Eye Pix. At first, it seems odd that Larry Fessenden would have produced what seems like an archetypal Sundance selection about multicultural strivers in New York City: The story focuses on one, Luciana (Asensio), an immigrant from Spain, running away from her past, struggling-often along the F line, in Brooklyn-to survive and find odd jobs.Most Beautiful Island follows Luciana during a not-atypical day: to a doctor she can't afford, because she has no insurance; to her apartment, where most things in the fridge have ""Not Yours"" notes taped onto them by her roommate. We see her pick up insolent children from school and walk them home, and we see her dressed up in a provocative yet silly costume, handing out fliers. Then, a fellow immigrant and friend, Olga (Natasha Romanova), from the flyering job, asks Luciana to fill in for her at another gig, which sounds too good to be true: Get paid $2,000 to show up at a cocktail party and look pretty-no sex-stuff required, just a black dress and some high heels.Up to this point, Most Beautiful Island feels like a meandering, ethnographic quasi-documentary, set all over New York City, on familiar streets but also in back rooms and back alleys many people don't often see. It's set in a milieu of hustling immigrant women, living within a culture of seemingly infinite economic possibilities that all seem somehow out of reach. Each has her own reasons for being in the city and her own ways of making money-through Craigslist, or networks of other women in similar circumstances. Luciana often relies on the kindnesses of other immigrants: the shopkeepers who say she can pay tomorrow, and give her an extra little treat, or the cabbies who shrug off her inability to pay. But others tell her that we make our own luck and get what we deserve, espousing a moralistic social Darwinism that's brought to life in the film's second half, in the form of a biting metaphor.Olga's job offer, which leads Luciana to a cinderblock-lined basement along the West Side Highway, is indeed too good to be true. Women stand in narrow circles, drawn and numbered in chalk, in which they're ogled by ladies and gentlemen in evening dress holding champagne-and stern men in black prevent the women from leaving. We're made to wait there with them, airs of tension, menace, and mystery getting denser as the women are led one by one into a ""party room,"" to which the well-dressed have retired. When Luciana is finally called in, the moment is nightmarish-a relatively simple yet quite unexpected scenario that's stomach-twisting in its elemental horror but also in the fact that many of these women, abject in their desperation, have volunteered to participate, putting their lives at risk for sport and cash. The experience seems as dehumanizing as a sexual assault.Many genre movies in which bad things happen to women end with them fighting back, but here, as people surely would in real life, they just take the money and run. There's no grand climax, no wicked revenge or Grand Guignol comeuppance, just a shot of a stretch of New York City highway, a faded sign, painted on a brick wall, visible if you squint: BIG APPLE BIG DREAMS. Its irony turns grotesque if you remember the film's opening text: ""Inspired by true events."" This is how the other half really lives today."

Blame,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4607722/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A drama teacher's taboo relationship with an unstable student strikes a nerve in her jealous classmate, sparking a vengeful chain of events within their suburban high school that draws parallels to 'The Crucible'. It's the start of a new year at a small suburban high school. Abigail is an outcast who seeks solace in the worlds of the characters she reads about, much to the amusement of her manipulative classmate, Melissa. When an intriguing new drama teacher Jeremy casts Abigail over Melissa in Arthur Miller's The Crucible, Abigail's confidence blooms, and soon her relationship with Jeremy begins to move beyond just fantasy. Melissa, fueled by vengeful jealousy, begins to spiral out of control and concocts a plot against Abigail. This triggers a chain of events that will come to affect everyone around them, as well as reveal some dark truths. Abigail is shown lying in bed at the movie's start. She doesn't want to go back to high school. Wherever it is, the school is identified only as ""MHS"". Among the books she has in her bedroom is ""Sybil"".But Ms. Cohen, in a meeting with Abigail and her parents, says Abigail should go ahead and get back to her routine as soon as possible. The parents agree.Melissa is a cheerleader who wears too much makeup and not enough clothes. Her hair is several different colors, some of which could not possibly be found in nature. She is quite rebellious and listens to rap music. Robert, the man she lives with, tells her she needs to get out of bed because she has just enough time to get to school. And don't wear that. In a later scene Robert is called to the school because a parent needs to meet with someone from the school, but Melissa says, ""He's not my father"", to which the reply is that he is a guardian.At school, Melissa changes out of the proper outfit, putting on something unacceptable, though no one from the school seems to think so. She is so happy to see her friends Sophie and Ellie. Then they see Abigail and call her ""Psycho Sybil"". Ellie isn't as enthusiastic about making fun of Abigail. One of the reasons they make fun of her is her limp.In Mrs. Howell's class, Abigail talks about her collection of glass animals. She is holding a unicorn. Mrs. Howell is pregnant.In the library, Eric asks Abigail for her number saying he would like to go out with her. He seems really nice until he asks which one of her personalities will he be dating. Then he, TJ and another boy laugh.The next day Jeremy Woods is teaching Mrs. Howell's class, saying Mrs. Howell went into labor. Although Mrs. Howell left him a lesson plan, he does not want to teach ""The Glass Menagerie"". Instead he wants the class to perform ""The Crucible"" for the 2016 Drama Showcase. The performance must take place in the auditorium during a single class period, which will not be long enough for the entire play, so Jeremy will divide the class into groups and the ones who do the best job will get to perform in the auditorium, and the rest of the play will be done in the classroom only. Abigail is late to class and Jeremy first tells her to get a pass from the guidance office, then he says he is kidding. When he gives out the major parts, Jeremy wants Abigail to be Abigail because she has the name already, and he wants her to complete with Melissa for the part. Eric is given another role which will involve romance with the character Abigail. Melissa considers Eric to be her boyfriend and she isn't happy.Jeremy goes home and Jennifer has great news. There is a job Jeremy would be great for and he just has to meet with Michael. Jeremy explains that the teaching job is a commitment but he can take the other job later. Jennifer is frustrated that Jeremy doesn't have enough ambition and thinks that teaching is silly. At least it is better than trying to make it as an actor. But Jennifer wishes Jeremy would commit to something permanently, suggesting he never has. Jeremy thanks her for coming over and their goodbye is quite platonic.At home, Abigail lights candles in her room and there is creepy art.When the time comes to perform the roles in class, Eric is out sick. Or is he? Two of the students are shown making out. Melissa isn't there either so Jeremy tells Abigail to play Abigail, and Jeremy will play the other role, as he did in college. Abigail is quite good, and later Jeremy invites her to the auditorium to learn about the various jobs required to put on a play. Later signs advertising the performance list Abigail as assistant director. Melissa will be understudy.There is a football game. The cheerleaders are shown excited before the game. Afterward Melissa and Sophie drink and plot against Abigail. There are other scenes where the girls drink or smoke or both, sometimes with boys.The next day Eric apologizes for not being there to play his role, and he asks Abigail to meet him in the auditorium after school to spend extra time on their lines. Eric never intended to show up and the other girls lock Abigail in the auditorium. Jeremy finds her there and lets her out, and since it is raining he takes her home. It is not out of his way. In a later scene, Abigail believes she lost her necklace in his car and Jeremy offers to help her search.Jennifer is waiting for Jeremy at his place and demands to know why he didn't meet with Michael. When his explanation isn't satisfactory, she goes back home.Abigail starts showing up at school dressed like her character. She and Melissa get in arguments but only Melissa gets in trouble because either Abigail changes personality quickly or she's a really good actress. It has been established that at least in the play, the latter is true. In one scene, Abigail is furious because Melissa has her necklace. Abigail backs off but Melissa is shaken up. Sophie also behaves like a bully from time to time but Ellie is ostracized when she doesn't want to.Later Abigail's clothing becomes more sexy than Puritanical.Jeremy and Abigail continue to rehearse in the auditorium. When they have to kiss, it is quite real. Word gets out that Abigail and Jeremy are having an inappropriate relationship. In fact, when Jeremy and Jennifer get together and start kissing (and possibly doing more), the audience sees Abigail.Sophie sees Ellie in the chemistry lab and apologizes for the way she has been treating Ellie. Sophie says they should study together for the chemistry test, and she confesses she and Eric had sex. When they study together, Ellie is out of the room and Sophie finds her diary, which has the evidence that Jeremy and Abigail are having an inappropriate relationship.Sophie and Melissa get together later and Melissa searches online for information about teachers and students having sex. Somehow Sophie has Ellie's diary but it is missing the important page.After another football game, there is a homecoming event. The other girls dress nicely but Melissa's outfit can best be described as S & M. Sophie admits to Ellie she read the diary and tells Ellie she should report what Jeremy and Abigail are doing. Ellie doesn't want to and she's not happy Sophie got into her diary.On another day, Melissa sees Jeremy in the auditorium and starts kissing him. He doesn't want to. Melissa also demands to know why Abigail got the part instead of her.The time comes for the performance and Abigail is nowhere to be found, so Melissa will go on instead. When Abigail shows up, Melissa is upset. Abigail plays the part all too well. She is quite angry, as it turns out, because she feels Jeremy has been leading her on when there's nothing there.Melissa goes to Ms. Cohen's office and says she has something to report. A cop shows up to take her statement. Melissa is upset when Robert shows up, but a parent or guardian is needed for this. Melissa claims Jeremy wanted to kiss her and more, including inappropriate photos. She says she gave in so he would stop hitting her. Asked how long this had been going on, Melissa says it has been going on for a long time, obviously longer than Jeremy has been teaching. Robert tries to comfort her and Melissa demands that he not touch her. It is now clear it was Robert who was abusing her.Jeremy takes Abigail home again and stays until she is feeling better. He hugs her but there is clearly nothing sexual about it.At school later, Abigail sees Melissa outside getting ready to go in."

Alexa refuses to help at first, but when Maddie stands up for Cole against Kane, she agrees to help.Alexa introduces Maddie and Cole to a group of other kids willing to help them: Ephraim, nicknamed ""Strings"" for his clothes, Emile, who has vowed to remain mute because of his high-pitched voice, Tig, who was slut-shamed by her popular boyfriend, Sweats, a overweight boy who sweats uncontrollably due to a gland problem, and Nick, a former basketball player shunned by his teammates for being gay. They refuse to help, suspecting Maddie intends to prank them, but she persuades them to stay by admitting that she envies how little they care for being popular.Maddie's decision to take Cole to the prom increases his popularity, and Marissa tries to get him to be her date instead of Kane. Cole refuses, and when Kane tries to get Maddie to take him back, Alexa inadvertently reveals that they once dated back when she was a cheerleader, until Marissa manipulated Kane into dumping her for Maddie.As the date for prom approaches, Maddie decides to go with Kane instead of Cole. Hurt, Cole nearly calls the plan off, but his father intervenes. A former prom king himself, he admits that his greatest regret was humiliating Maddie's parents in front of the whole school, which in turn caused them to push their daughter into becoming popular. Believing that his lack of humility was the reason why he and Cole's mother ultimately separated, he urges Cole to humble the popular kids so they don't turn out like him.The night of the prom, the kids rig the polling system, put a drug in Marissa's punch that causes her to sweat uncontrollably, display doctored pornographic images of Kane, and turn their tormentors against each other using social media. When Maddie is crowned Prom Queen, Emile, mistaking her for Marissa, dumps tar on her head before Sweats pulls the fire alarm. Marissa takes revenge on Cole for dumping her by pulling down his pants in front of the entire student body. Having had enough, Cole delivers a lengthy speech in which he criticizes how the students have hurt each other in order to be popular, which he realizes is ultimately for nothing. Afterwards, Emile, full of confidence, yells out ""F the prom!""Cole and Maddie resume their friendship, while the other kids enjoy their graduation and look forward to the future rather than ruminate on their past."

Taste of Life,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7790498/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"What does life taste of? For joyful Nikki the answer is clear: of pleasure. Delightfully she enjoys this at every possible occasion, as she drives through the country looking for people and their stories for her video-blog. What does life taste like? For the 40-year-old Nikki, this question can be answered very simply: after semen. She runs a video blog and travels through the countryside in search of people and their stories with their Land Rover. She interviews the most diverse people letting them tell about their lives. Life tastes different for everyone, because where desires and longings differ, so is the view of life. Uncommented, Nikki lets people speak, gives them a voice, only to take control again. The cheerful lady is the link between the most varied stories. The stories are different, at best to be described as loose fragments, which then content again down so without sense and reason to the audience, that this is literally pushed off the head. There are two ladies lying naked on a rock talking about Bockwurst, a man in the forest confronted with his possible impotence, or a lady on a couch who knees on her head a few minutes later located between the legs of an elderly gentleman. The film portrays life in an associative collage about the topics of sex and relationship, guilt and religion, meaning and nonsense of conventions - and thus gives a voyeuristic insight into the desires and desires of the protagonists. What does life taste of? For joyful Nikki (Antje Nikola Mönning) the answer is clear: of pleasure.

-I'm not so much interested in the topics that are shown every night in the evening news, but rather what the people on the road are telling. Every person has a story. (NIKKI)
Cheeky, explosive and full of easiness the film pictures life in associative images all around topics of Sex and relationship, guilt and religion, sense and nonsense of conventions - and thus let you have a voyeuristic insight into the desires and longings of the protagonists.
'This year we are going to make a film.' This was the first idea and it was 1st of June 2017.
'Who wants to be part of it?'. After deciding on the cast, the creative part of forming ideas for the script started. We knew we did not want to have a narrative story. There should be no explanations. 'To get inspired I started looking through Rolands old archives of texts he has written but which were far to good to be rotting away in a dusty corner.' (Mira Gittner) 'Over the last years we had quite a few encounters with people and their stories, which we wanted to integrate into one of our movies.' (Roland Reber) 'The best platform for one's emotional exhibitionism is the Internet'. (Antje Nikola Mönning)
So there it was: the basic idea of NIKKI, the video-blogger who catches people and their stories on her camera without commenting.
It only took two month of preparation, deciding on the idea for the story line, the cast and finding and organizing the locations for TASTE OF LIFE. After that it was within 25 days in august that the movie finally has been shot with a small team behind the camera, 50 people in front of the camera and 11 different locations - and lots of enthusiasm and creativity of everyone involved. After another five weeks of post production the final cut was ready in October 2017 and could celebrate its world premier at the 51st Hof international Film Festival (October 2017), its international premiere at the Brussles International Film Festival in Belgium (April 2018). Theatrical release in Germany was 22nd of February. Since October 2018 the film has been released on DVD and Blu-Ray as well as on digital platforms."

Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.The Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Arsus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and begin crossing an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are shot at by more of Kuratov's troops on another pipe. Khan jumps from the airplane swinging on a grapple line to slice the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.While the other Guardians try to figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia grabs the power source to short circuit it. She is injured but this does temporarily disable the beacon's transmissions causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov again on the platform at the top of the tower but fail to defeat him. Khan uses his super speed to tie all of the Guardians to a grappling rope and attach it to an airplane to escape. Kuratov interferes with the plane's controls, but Khan cuts the grappling rope and they fall into a river before the plane crashes.As they emerge from the river, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to. She tells them that as superhumans, they can also pool their energy and release it as a blast, but doing so might be fatal. The Guardians touch each other and generate a blast of energy that destroys Kuratov's tower, and the skyscrapers supporting it causing Kuratov to fall to his death. Major Elena says that, while Kuratov boasted that he created the Guardians, they really created themselves.The Guardians recover, rendezvousing with Major Elena on a bridge in the rebuilt Moscow. Although they choose to go back to their normal lives, they also consider continuing their service to the Patriot organization. As they walk away, Elena tells them that ""we found other Guardians."" In a post-credits scene, Elena is seen attacking a soldier after his truck stops. When she questions the soldier, he tells her that ""Ferrum"" has sent him as part of an unspecified mission."
Three Christs,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5706370/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Three Christs follows Dr. Alan Stone who is treating three paranoid schizophrenic patients at the Ypsilanti State Hospital in Michigan, each of whom believed they were Jesus Christ. What transpires is both comic and deeply moving. Three Christs tells the story of an extraordinary experiment that began in 1959 at Michigan's Ypsilanti State Hospital, where Dr. Alan Stone treated three paranoid schizophrenic patients who each believe they are Jesus Christ. Dr. Stone pioneers a simple, yet revolutionary treatment: instead of submitting the patients to electroshock, forced restraints and tranquilizers, he puts them in a room together to confront their delusions. What transpires is a darkly comic, intensely dramatic story about the nature of identity and the power of empathy. 1959. Lured away from a career in academia, psychotherapist Dr. Alan Stone, hired by Dr. Bill Rogers, has just started a job at the Ypsilanti State Hospital to work with delusional patients, accepting it on the promise that he be able to treat them in a more humane and what he hopes effective way than the typical institutional interventions of frontal lobotomies, insulin to induce comas, other placating drugs, and electroshock therapy. Coincidentally stumbling upon a first and then a second both at the hospital, therefore searching for any others in the Michigan mental health institutional system resulting in a third, he decides to conduct a research study on paranoid schizophrenics who believe they are reallyJesus Christ, the research despite or perhaps in light of his own non-religious background and belief. In receiving the somewhat reluctant and skeptical approval from the hospital's Superintendent Dr. Eldrich Orbus, he is able to bring together and house the ""Three Christs"" - Joseph Cassel, Clyde Benson and Leon Gabor - each who manifests his belief in a very different way from the other two, in a separate ward away from the general patient population, with the understanding that they are his patients under his direct care, with no one else authorized to administer any treatment, especially the most oft used electroshock, without his approval. Beyond Dr. Stone dealing with the three very different men in needing to view them both individually and as a collective, the research study is affected by: the presence of his young, attractive research assistant Becky Henderson, who accepted the job for ulterior motives, and who, as a further consequence, unwittingly throws a wrench into his personal life in the reaction to her by his wife, Ruth Stone; and the ongoing conflicts with Dr. Orbus, who really wants nothing to do with the study, that is unless it garners any positive publicity for the hospital and thus himself. In the process, Dr. Stone will have to evaluate his own methods, namely if he is crossing the line of ethics, and if he, like his patients, is acting like God.—Huggo"

El Camino Christmas,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3255590/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Eric comes to El Camino looking for his unknown dad. He's harassed, hit and jailed by a drunk local cop, who later shoots at a liquor mart with Eric +4 inside. The sheriff and deputy then shoot up the place, answering each other's fire. The project, scripted by Melfi and writer Chris Wehner, is about a young man (Grimes) who seeks out a father he has never met and, through no fault of his own, ends up barricaded in a liquor store with five other people on Christmas Eve. The story takes place in the fictitious town of El Camino, NV.—Peter White The movie opens as gunfire erupts at Vicente's Liquor Mart in El Camino, Nevada. After a brief flurry of shots the sheriff calls for a ceasefire. As he & his deputy Billy gather behind his car to take stock of the situation it begins to snow. Then a graphic appears introducing a flashback to 39 hours earlier. We see scenes of several characters as they begin their day; a mother & her son getting breakfast, a woman watching morning news (where the mention that is hasn't snowed on Christmas for 40 years), Vicente the store owner opening his store & a young man driving an older model convertible muscle car down the highway.
The sheriff arrives at his office & begins to berate another deputy Carl, whom we have just witnessed drinking on the job, for failure to do his job properly. Carl argues back that he's served the county well for almost 30 years. The scene shifts to the young man arriving at a roadside motel, checking in just deputy Carl arrives to sit in the lobby. As the young man, Eric Norris, checks in he attempts to use a credit card which is denied. The clerk, Billy the off-duty deputy in civilian clothes, starts to call the card company but Eric talks him out of it & pays cash for his room. Carl & Billy attempt to make conversation with Eric but Eric is short-tempered & says he just wants to get to his room & rest. Then we see Eric in his room looking at an old photograph of a young man with the name Mike Roth & the date 1969 on the back. Eric hears an odd noise & notices that his toilet is overflowing.
Scene shifts to a doctors office where the mother Kate & has brought her son Seth. The doctor is telling Kate her son is autistic because he's not talking & Kate rejects this idea telling the doctor Seth will talk when he's ready. Then it shifts to a newswoman eating lunch with her cameraman at a highway rest area, complaining that she is always sent to cover local, feel-good stories & expressing her desire to go national with her career. Next we see Kate & Seth at a diner counter while Eric eats a booth nearby where he hears Kate tell Seth she can't afford to buy him dessert. When Eric leaves he buys a piece of cake & has it sent to Seth, walking out just as the waitress tells Kate who paid for it.
Next we see Carl & Billy watching Eric as he comes out of a store with a bottle of Drano. Carl tells Billy that Eric is cooking meth (bad credit card, buying chemicals) & he bears watching. Eric arrives at Vicente's store to buy a drink but the clerk, Kate, has headphones on & doesn't hear him come in. Billy startles Kate when he finally gets her attention & she chews him out ""for sneaking up & hovering over"" her. She is witchy to him as he attempts to make small talk while buying his tequila but finally thaws a little & is slightly friendlier just as he is leaving.
We see Eric sitting outside an apartment building, looking as if he's trying to decide whether to go knock or not. He does & a very grumpy man answers the door & cusses him out for disturbing him. Eric tells the man that he is looking for someone named Michael Roth & that this apartment was his last known address. The man denies knowing the name & tells Eric to get lost. Just as Eric is getting into his car the man shouts from the window that he can tell him about the guy that lived there before him if Eric will buy him a beer. Eric reluctantly agrees. On the way to the bar the man tells Eric his name is Charles then pulls out a baggie & rolls a joint. At the bar Charles is demanding, loud & obnoxious & almost gets into a fight with 2 young men before Eric intervenes & pulls him away from them. He then tells Eric he doesn't remember anything about the man. Eric gets angry & leaves. Later as Charles leaves the bar the 2 young men from earlier beat him up & leave him lying on the ground. At this point we see Charles has a handgun but even though he points it at the men as they run away, he doesn't shoot.
When Eric arrives at the motel the deputies surprise him. As Carl confronts Eric, Billy finds the bag of weed in the front seat. They take him to the jail where they question him about cooking meth, which Eric denies. Carl loses his temper & hits Eric with his baton, knocking him out.
The next morning we see Vicente opening his store & realizing his cooler is not working. After trying to fix it himself he calls Kate & asks her to come fix it like she has done before. She agrees & since her mother can't watch Seth she takes him to the store also. Meanwhile Billy feels bad about how Carl beat up Eric so he leaves the jail door open, hands Eric his car keys & essentially tells him to leave while Billy goes to the bathroom. Eric leaves & runs to the hotel where his car was left but as he pulls out of the parking lot Carl spots him. A chase ensues with Eric eventually running Carl off the road but not before Carl shoots his engine. We see Charles has made his way to Vicente's also & is buying beer as Eric, who's car has stalled, rushes in to get some antifreeze for his car.
As Eric steps up to the register Carl shows up & fires into the store. When he enters the store Charles shoots him in the leg & kicks away his gun which Eric picks up. Charles explains to Carl that he only shot him because Carl fired at him first, whereupon Carl states that he was after Eric, the fugitive. Eric yells that Billy released him but Carl yells that he can explain that to a judge & that Charles will be arrested for attempted murder of a police officer. Carl pulls out pepper spray & aims it at Eric while Eric yells at him to put it away. As they argue sirens announce the arrival of additional police & now Eric seems conflicted but he is also obviously scared and doesn't let anyone leave like Vicente & others are urging him to do. Eric handcuffs Carl and asks Vicente if there is a backdoor to get away.
Eric goes to the backdoor which is padlocked but tries to open the window above to see if he can get through it. He opens it just as the sheriff was sneaking up to look through, hitting the sheriffs hand with the window & causing his gun to fire wildly into the air. Billy, in front of the store, thinks he is taking fire so he & the sheriff, in the rear, begin exchanging shots with one another, each not knowing they are the only ones shooting, not anyone from within the store. Eventually the sheriff figures this out so calls for a ceasefire & goes back to the front with Billy after having shot much of Vicente's merchandise all to smithereens.
While others in the store encourage Eric to turn himself in Carl tells Eric he can will be in trouble for additional charges like kidnapping, hit-and-run & attempted murder. This causes Eric to panic & instead of letting everyone go he just keeps things as they are. The sheriff calls into the store but Eric tells him that because of Carl he doesn't trust the local police. At this time a verbal exchange between the sheriff & Billy informs us that Billy is his nephew & the sheriff thinks Billy is mostly inept. The sheriff gives other deputies instructions on surrounding the building & tells Billy to get as much information as he can about who's in the store. After some time has passed Billy comes back with a very thorough & well-reasoned assessment of the situation which makes the sheriff reevaluate his potential as an officer & recant out loud to Billy his earlier insults.
Vicente & Kate try to talk Eric into releasing everyone & turning himself in but Charles discourages this, saying the police are trigger-happy. When Eric voices his thoughts out loud that he can explain the weed & the Drano & his running from Carl, Carl says it will be his word against Carl's & Charles agrees out loud that officials will believe Carl because he wears the uniform. Once again Eric is ultimately indecisive & let's things continue in a standoff.
The newswoman & her cameraman are filming the local feel-good story when she notices 2 deputies in the audience leave quickly. They follow the deputies to Vicente's & are the first news crew on scene. They intrude on the sheriff as he's trying to coordinate his efforts & get a quick video interview that gets the attention of the network & goes out on the local channel. The sheriff calls into the store again but this time Charles answers & gives the sheriff a demand for ransom money. Charles tells Eric that he doesn't think the cops outside are very smart therefore he doesn't think the odds of a good ending are favorable. The sheriff is confused because he realizes he's talked to 2 different people inside that both seemed to act like they were in charge. The newswoman manages to also get an interview with Billy during which he announces that the suspect in the holdup is Eric.
As everyone sits around inside the store, Carl continues to antagonize & threaten Eric while Eric tries to get Carl to tell everyone how he beat him up & shot at him. Charles is berating Carl for his obviously locally well-known bad behavior but Carl then proceeds to go around the room reminding everyone (Kate, Vicente, even Charles) how he's helped them out in the past, as if this excuses his misdeeds. As Carl rants he asks Eric why he was in El Camino anyway & Eric explains that he was looking for his father whom he's never met.
Seth needs to go to the bathroom so Eric follows as he & Kate go to the restroom in the back. During this time we see the sheriff planning an assault on the store with his deputies to get it resolved before the state police arrive. After Seth has finished Eric continues to sit in the back & visit with Kate, eventually telling her he's decided to let everyone leave & turn himself in. As they talk Eric fixes a remote control car Seth has been playing with & Kate recognizes that Eric is actually a nice guy in a bad situation. They return to the front just as the sheriff calls Carl's cell phone. Eric releases Carl's handcuffs so he can answer the phone & tells Carl to tell the sheriff he's releasing everyone but instead Carl just listens as the sheriff tells him of his plan to attack the building. Carl hangs up without telling the sheriff about Eric's plan to turn himself in so when Eric takes the phone from Carl & calls the sheriff back he hears the phone right outside the door. At this point Carl pulls out a gun he had hidden & shoots Eric in the stomach. As Carl turns & aims his gun at Charles, Eric shoots & kills Carl & Charles takes Carl's gun & fires it into the air in an apparent attempt to scare away the police who are sneaking through the front door. This causes the police to open fire on the building. Vicente stupidly stands up & moves toward the window, yelling at the police to stop shooting. He is quickly shot multiple times & falls out the broken window onto the ground. The cops eventually stop shooting & this brings us back to the opening scene with the sheriff & Billy huddling behind his car.
Inside the store Charles looks at Eric's wound, tells him he's gonna survive then uses a first-aid kit to bandage him up. As they sit & contemplate the mess they are in, Charles reflects back on a Christmas day in Vietnam when he was in the war. With Kate also listening nearby, he tells Eric the story of how he had cancelled an artillery strike on a defenseless village then proceeded to take his men into the village. But his superiors had decided to continue with the artillery strike, resulting in the death of all his men. Charles explained that this destroyed him because he loved these men & he felt responsible. His superiors blamed him for the deaths & he was dishonorably discharged. Because he felt so guilty he didn't want to face anyone who knew him so he left his wife & infant son. As he tells the story Eric fills in a small detail at the end & tells Charles/Mike he knew the story because he had read the letters his father had written to Eric's mother years ago. Charles/Mike convinces Eric that they need to end the standoff.
In the meantime the state police arrive & inform the sheriff he's no longer in charge. Charles/Mike convinces Eric that they need to end the standoff. Charles/Mike yells out to the police that he is sending Kate & Seth out so don't shoot. As they leave Seth speaks his first words, telling Eric ""Thank you"" when he hands him the remote control car. Kate is obviously moved by this & looks gratefully toward Eric, apparently for taking the time to be kind to her son thereby bringing about this change. After they leave, Charles/Mike tells Eric that the police really don't know who's been responsible for this whole mess so now that Carl is dead he intends to take responsibility since his life has been messed up for a long time & Eric is still young enough to have a good life. Eric resists the idea but Charles insists & yells out to the police that he will be coming out. Before he leaves he hands Eric a set of keys with dog tags (military ID) for Micheal Roth, verifying that he is indeed Eric's father. Once outside he tells the police he left a wounded hostage inside then he pulls both pistols & aims them at the police, causing the police to open fire & kill him.
Another graphic tells us we have fast-forwarded to 6 months later. In a series of very short scenes we see the sheriff undergoing hypnosis to help him stop smoking, Billy handling a citizen complaint then asking her to put his election sign in her yard, the newswoman getting to report on a national story, Vicente on a beach discussing how lucky he was to have survived 4 gunshot wounds then getting paid $8 million per wound & finishing with Kate and Seth enjoying breakfast at the diner. Again we see the waitress bring over a piece of cake that Kate says she didn't order. Just at that moment Eric sits down on the stool next to Seth. The scene shifts to the outside of the diner & backs away as inside they apparently strike up a friendly conversation."
Blame!,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6574146/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the distant future, humans are declared ""illegal residents"" and hunted to near extinction by murderous robots. One day, a group of human scavengers come across a strange man named Killy, who may be the key to humanity's survival. In the distant technological future, civilization has reached its ultimate Net-based form. An ""infection"" in the past caused the automated systems to spiral out of order, resulting in a multi-leveled city structure that replicates itself infinitely in all directions. Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the only thing that can save her now is the sudden arrival of Kiri the Wanderer, on his quest for the Net Terminal Genes, the key to restoring order to the world. The film opens with a young woman in a small village narrating about the events that lead up to the beginning of Blame!At an unspecified (and therefore, unknown) time, a massive city was created that eclipsed the entire world and then some. Humans controlled the robots, known as the safeguard, that worked in the city, until a mysterious contagion spread throughout. As a result, all humans were declared ""illegal residents"" by the safeguard, and therefore an extermination order was issued against everyone. Though some humans survived, they're all trapped in the city and still under threat from the safeguard.According to the narrator, it happened ""long before she was born"".The scene then cuts to a different time (once again, it's unspecified how long after the contagion), six people, known as ""Electro-fishers"", dressed in advanced gear called ""helmettals"" begin scavenging throughout the city, looking for food and other supplies for their village. They evade the gaze of a ""watchtower"", which would've otherwise alerted the entire safeguard to their location. The leader, Zuru, tries to find a new hunting ground when they've still come up with nothing.However, her friends, Tae and Fusata, worry that they've gotten lost as the route was different on a map (even though the map was way outdated). They then find an exit out of the city block they are in. When they attempt to go to another block, Tae trips and nearly falls, dropping some supplies and a spare battery in order to avoid falling to her death.While Zuru observes their surroundings, a massive ""builder"" suddenly appears, however, it doesn't attack them as builders are uninterested in humans. They then jump a massive gap to another city block and climb to the top of it. They go through a massive, open area that no one has yet explored before. However, security is still tight, with many watchtowers everywhere. The group regret their choice for going that far into the city as the grown-ups have told them not to, furthermore, they took their gear and left without permission from the village elder, ""pops"". Nonetheless, they decide to continue and search for some sludge (their food) for their starving village as well as Tae's sister, Ito.They manage to successfully evade the watchtower and by luck, find a sludge pipe. However, the sludge pipe is completely drained and has nothing left in it. They accidentally go into the view of another watchtower which sounds and alarm and sends several robots, known as ""exterminators"" against them. One of the group members is attacked and decapitated by an exterminator. Realizing they're outnumbered and can't win in a fight, they decide to run. However, while Zuru just barely manages to evade some of them, two more members of the group are killed by exterminators. Tae trips and falls down a high slope and gets attacked by an exterminator, which she's unable to shoot in her panic. Zuru jumps over and manages to destroy the exterminator before it can kill Tae, but then falls and crashes into the ground. Several more exterminators continue to chase her, which she's unable to fight back against. Just then, she sees a man up ahead, clad in black, and with many scars on his face. He takes out a small gun and fires a massive laser close to Zuru. She evades the shot, which hits and destroys the exterminators behind her, before exploding against a wall. Zuru gets back up and two more exterminators, which survived the powerful laser, run at her before being destroyed by Tae and Fusata.While being helped up by her friends, Zuru notices a device around the man's neck with a blinking blue light. Just then, the watchtower's siren suddenly stops, to their surprise. The mysterious man calmly demands they take off their headgear so that he can see their eyes. Tae and Fusata advise against this as it will make them more easily detectable by the watchtowers. Nonetheless, after a long pause, Zuru removes her helmettals. Even more to the friends surprise, this doesn't trigger the alarm, although it was supposed to. Tae and then Fusata then take of their helmettals too and show him their faces. He seems to scan their eyes with a built-in scanner in his own eyes.The man then asks if there are any humans with the net terminal gene around, confusing the group. Though Zuru wants to thank him for saving them, they don't know what he's talking about. Knowing what he's looking for isn't there, the man starts to leave, but then Zuru states that one of the grown-ups at their village may know what he's talking about. The man stops and Zuru then asks what his name is.The man responds that his name is Killy and he's a human.Zuru, Tae, and Fusata guide Killy back to their village, the one place that the safeguard doesn't enter, though they don't know why. Once they get there, the guards, Sutezo and Pops, fire upon Killy, being that he's an unknown outsider. They are also surprised that they're not wearing their helmettals despite the danger that poses, though Fusata explains that they're okay around Killy, who rescued them. However, Sutezo is skeptical and believes that Killy isn't really human, hearing that there are safeguard members who disguise themselves as humans. But Pops believes that Killy is human and allows them all into the village. Killy walks through the perimeter, proving that he's not a safeguard. Pops asks him where he came from, to which he responds ""6,000 levels below"".In the village, it used to house around 400 people at one point, but now only has 150, possibly due to exterminator attacks. Their custom is to welcome any outside human travelers due to them being undermanned, though Killy is the first human that generation to actually come. It's said that Electro-Fishers, descended from a line of humans called ""planters"", founded the village 300 years ago, and the remnants of humanity have lived there since then. However, Pops claims that they don't know anything about the outside world (including whether or not there are other human survivors), and any stories from an outsider (hence, Killy) would be valuable information.Killy is taken into the village where the people are shocked that only 3 of the kids have survived and the victim's equipment has been lost as well (since they don't have the technology to make any more helmettals), even more so that they've still returned empty-handed. The village is suffering a severe food problem and worry that they'll starve in just a month. The villagers look at Killy with confusion and curiosity (again, he's the first outsider they've ever seen) while he scans many of their eyes with his own eyes.A curious and excited little girl runs up to Killy to meet him. He then reaches in his back pocket and gives the little girl a small, yellow, brick-like object. A boy takes the brick and examines it briefly, it's hard as a rock, but a small drawing on the side of it says to drop it in water. He then drops it into a pool of water, where it suddenly morphs and grows to a gigantic size, some of the villagers eat it, finding it soft, good-tasting, and highly nutritious, therefore nourishing the entire village. Although he looks menacing with his many scars, permanent scowl, and softspoken attitude, Killy proves himself to be kind. One of the leaders of the village, Fuku tells the kids that she's glad they made it back, but asks them to not do it again.Pops then asks to talk with Killy in private, thanking him for feeding their village and asking Killy where he obtained that food. Killy responds that it's from 200 levels below, meaning that it's impossible to get anymore (since not human has ever gone through ONE level). He once again asks for any humans with the Net Terminal Gene, to which Sutezo responds he's never heard of it. However, Pops then states that he has heard something about it, and that a ""rotting shrine"" beneath their village may provide some information. However, they've been told through generations to avoid it (Sutezo even believes that there's a ghost that possesses and trespassers, and caused his grandfather to fall to his death on the way down). Nonetheless, Killy immediately starts walking away towards the rotting shrine without any word, to which Zuru, Pops, and Sutezo (reluctantly) follow him.Upon going to the bottom of the perimeter, far below the village, Killy and the group find a strange, glitchy, red hologram of a woman that speaks very distorted and seems to be saying nonsense. Killy walks through the hologram, which immediately disappears, then lifts a massive piece of rubble, finding a decayed head of a woman underneath it. He picks up the head and slams it against the wall a couple of times, to which it then suddenly sparks to life and begins talking with a speaker implanted in it's throat.The woman identifies herself as Cibo, a scientist who existed since before the contagion began. She's been waiting for 17,526,000 hours (over 2,000 years) for someone to come, attempting to call for help all that time, to no avail until now. Killy scans her and finds traces of the contagion in her irises, meaning she doesn't have the Net Terminal Gene. Cibo states that she and her scientists have been attempting to work on a synthetic terminal since the extermination began in an attempt to communicate with the Safeguard's A.I, the Authority, and end the robots extermination. She even created a barrier device to keep the Safeguard out while they did their experiments (hence, the reason why the villagers have been able to live there), however, they all died before their project could yield results. She then states that there is a factory to the north of the village that may still be in use, and that can produce literally anything, including a synthetic terminal. Killy at first meets this statement with skepticism, but Cibo insists that such a thing is, in fact, possible. Pops then asks her if she can create more of the ""food bricks"" that Killy brought back for the village. Cibo responds that she can, but only when they get to the factory.Killy, now convinced, then once again starts walking away without any thought or words, therefore Pops decides to gather a group to go to the factory with him. However, Cibo states that the factory is 15 blocks away, a journey that would take a few days and require plenty of their limited food for the trip. They hastily assemble a group with as many Electro-Fishers as there are helmettals remaining including Pops, Sutezo, Zuru, Tae (who's sister is doing better), and Fusata, and follow outside the perimeter.Along the way, they see a watchtower that has a clear view through a crack in the ceiling above them. There's no way around, but they then see Killy walk by it with no problem and without setting off the alarm. They follow him closely and find that they too have the ability to walk by the watchtower in full view without setting off the alarm, as long as they're behind him, naturally.That night, they stop to rest in an abandoned apartment building, preparing gruel made out of sludge to eat. Fuku offers some to Killy who simply remains silent. Cibo states that his metabolism levels are different from a regular human, and that he rarely needs to eat at all. Not to mention that Cibo is still only an exoskeleton and doesn't need to eat either. The rest of the group talk about a strange, stinging smell that the safeguard emits, apparently smelling of ions, though Zuru doesn't remember the smell very well. As Killy sits awake and motionless, Cibo recounts the events before and during the contagion, wherein the Safeguard suddenly lost control and declared all humans to be ""illegal residents"". She and her scientist friends tried to do what they could, but she's the only survivor, as the rest of them have died.Along the trip, the group then come to a dark corridor, apparently, no on who ever went in there has ever returned back (due to exterminators). The group are fearful and reluctant to move ahead, until Killy then nonchalantly walks by, giving them more confidence as Killy and anyone who's close to him seem immune to the sensors of the Safeguard. They come to the door of the factory, which Cibo then opens up with a code, allowing the group to go in.They find the inside of the factory to be a massive corridor with many empty experiment nodes and no exterminators in sight. Killy then puts Cibo on the main console in front of them, at her request. She gains access into the factory and then activates a node which produces a massive amount of ""food bricks"" as promised to the electro-fishers, who are overjoyed at the sight and start stuffing their backpacks with them. Cibo then begins to activate another node for the synthetic terminal which she wants Killy to get. However, she warns him that the last time she got that far into the system, things ended badly.Suddenly, while Killy walks to the terminal, Cibo seems to be having trouble before the entire system shuts down, to the worry of the group. The system then turns back on, and several nodes further away activate without Cibo doing anything, revealing that it has spawned several exterminators. The group hastily finish packing their packs and start firing at the exterminators, though Tae is forced to leave her pack behind to start running, and Cibo is knocked off and crushed by one of them. The group splits up and retreats towards the entrance to the factory while Killy stays behind to get the terminal. He fires his Gravitational Beam Emitter at several exterminators before destroying a surviving one with a knife he carries, to the surprise of the retreating group.As the group attempts to regroup, Zuru worries when she doesn't hear back from Tae. A group member then shows up, but is immediately killed by an exterminator, and another member, Atsuji, is wounded in the leg after destroying it. Zuru then hastily asks the other member where Tae is, to which he responds that she was crushed by an exterminator. She hurries back to find Tae having survived the attack despite a broken arm. The exterminator then jumps up at them before Fusata and Sutezo destroy it in the nick of time. Fusata being as overjoyed as Zuru that Tae has survived.Back inside the factory, another node suddenly activates, and a humanoid-looking robot emerges.The group is then cornered in the outside of the factory by the safeguard, and are unable to destroy them all, whereas Killy is unable to fire his weapon (presumably because it needs to charge). Suddenly, when all seems lost, a laser beam shoots between the group and the exterminators, who seem to stop behind it. The savior is revealed to be the humanoid robot, who is in fact Cibo who uploaded herself into the robot. She guides them to a train car that'll lead back to their village. However, the temporary barrier that she fired will soon wear off, and Atsuji asks to be left behind so as not to slow down the group, though Zuru refuses to do so. They all make it to the train car which Cibo powers up. However, the barrier wears off, and some exterminators grab onto the train car as it moves, the group doesn't have enough spears to fight them all off. Cibo states her regret to Killy, as they have managed to get the terminal and food, but won't make it back. To this, as the group runs out of spears, Killy injects himself with something in the neck which seems to boost but also weaken him, and fires a shot which destroys the rest of the exterminators, before then passing out.The group returns to their village with the unconscious Killy and the terminal, as well as Cibo in tow, though Tae seems to be acting a little strangely.Fusata walks Tae back to her home while the villagers treat Atsuji and any other wounded, while also being surprised at the tall and strong appearance of Cibo. Sutezo doesn't know whether or not Killy's alive, but Cibo insists that he's just sleeping. They take him inside and let him rest.That night, the Villagers celebrate the amount of food they've gotten and gather together for a party. Pops brings down the lights and leads a moment of silence for all the people they've lost, before allowing the people to continue eating, they now can become more nourished thanks to all the ""food bricks"" the group brought back. However, it's impossible to go back to the factory due to the vast presence of exterminators in it, though they've at least bought more time for the village and prevented them from starving for a while.Zuru goes to Killy, who's still sleeping, and talks to him. She states that Cibo's experiment may be successful and stop the safeguard once and for all, and asks if he will still continue his mission even if it does. She then pauses for a moment, and asks him if he could stay, having grown fond of him during their short time together. However, Cibo walks in and wakes Killy up, asking him to help her while she connects the synthetic terminal, as she cannot move and needs protection. As they leave, Zuru worries that her words fell on deaf ears with Killy.Though Pops hopes that Cibo's experiment will work, Sutezo meets it with skepticism, worrying that it will lead to another catastrophe as it did 2,000 years ago. Fusata decides to take some food to the injured Tae.Meanwhile, someone suddenly walks into the armory and takes one of the spearguns with them secretly.Sutezo goes to Zuru, asking her if she talked to Killy, but Zuru simply states that she didn't and walks away, wanting to be left alone. Pops helps Fuku carry supplies to storage. They all then meet up on top of the common area and see Fusata walking by. Zuru praises him for being considerate and kind to Tae, but he states that Tae wasn't in her room. Suddenly, they hear a noise and see that it's Tae walking around and dragging a speargun beside her. She aims off the side of the village while Fusata attempts to stop her, however, she fires the speargun, which destroys the barrier generator protecting the village. Suddenly, the watchtower outside detects the village and sounds the alarm, and a powerful vortex generates around Tae, which cuts off Pops' arm when he prevents a shocked Fusata from touching it.The truth is then revealed, Tae did not survive the factory. Instead, a humanoid-looking robot scanned her before killing her, then disguised itself as Tae to infiltrate the village.The intruder reveals itself as an advanced safeguard named Sanakan who was to infiltrate the village and terminate all humans. Fusata then reels further into shock and disbelief at this, therefore Sanakan aims it's much more powerful Gravitational Beam Emitter at him. Fuku manages to push him out of the way, but is killed by the beam herself. Sanakan then turns it's attention to the village members in the common area, firing through the roof and killing many of them.Killy and Cibo then notice Sanakan's destruction of the area, surprised that it got through the barrier. Cibo states that they should hurry, but Killy immediately starts running back to the village to protect them, leaving Cibo defenseless.Pops, Sutezo, Zuru, and Fusata, who snaps out of his shock, manage to escape from Sanakan, who then turns it's attention to the upper levels, contacting the watchtower for exterminators to kill the remaining humans, before then firing at the upper village, causing chaos up there as well.The electro-fishers gear up and get ready to fight the exterminators, though they run out of helmettals and Sutezo goes without one so that Zuru can have her'sKilly, still out of effective range of Sanakan, notices the electro-fishers struggling to fight the seemingly endless horde of exterminators. He detects the watchtower just outside the wall, then fires a shot at it, destroying the watchtower and the bridge to prevent anymore exterminators from coming in.Cibo then reaches the rotting shrine and activates the synthetic terminal and connects herself to the network.Zuru runs out to help with defending the village, but is then stopped by Fusata who's still in shock and denial over Tae's death. Zuru snaps him out of it, then runs ahead, giving him the last helmettal to protect himself, leaving without one herself.Sanakan continues to cause more chaos throughout the upper village. Sutezo sneaks around and shoots it in the head, but to no effect due to it's advanced armor. Sanakan shoots at him, but misses, then goes in for another shot, only for a sudden large explosion to disrupt it's detection system. Killy then appears through the explosion and punches it in the face, hard enough to throw it back. He then gets into a fight with it, destroying the floor beneath them, causing them both to fall a high height, yet still survive, much to the surprise of Sutezo. They get into another fight, wherein Killy's about to destroy Sanakan, however, it pushes him back and shoots off his right arm with it's Gravitation Beam Emitter, causing him to lose his own weapon, before they then fall from even higher.Killy and Sanakan crash onto the ground near the bottom of the village, while rubble and debris fall around them. Killy attempt to fight it with his knife, but is knocked down and beaten by Sanakan, who scans him and reveals that he's not a human, but a body stolen from the Safeguard (possibly implying that he's a sentient safeguard, or a cybernetically advanced human). It then offers him an ultimatum, to return to the safeguard or be destroyed, to which Killy picks the latter option. However, right as it's about to destroy him, Cibo accesses the netsphere, which Sanakan detects and turns it's attention to destroying Cibo, right below them. Right as it's about to fire, Sutezo fires two spears into it's upgraded weapon, throwing off it's aim and causing it to miss Cibo. Sanakan then fires at Sutezo, killing him.Zuru, shocked at this, and having retrieved Killy's Gravitational Beam Emitter, signals out to Killy and tosses it to him. He then breaks free from Sanakan and catches his weapon, firing at it, only for it to deflect the beam with it's hand, before then firing a small laser beam at Cibo, destroying her robotic body.With no options left, Killy injects himself with three of the syringes he injected earlier, all at once. Sanakan prepares to block it, but this time, it's far too powerful and is completely destroyed once and for all.The Electro-Fishers finally destroy the last of the exterminators, saving their village, including Fusata, who snapped out of his shock.Meanwhile, Cibo, who's arm is still intact and still contains her memories, gains access to the Netsphere, and finds the Authority, which controls the safeguard. However, the Authority states that the synthetic terminal is ineffective and her connection will be cut off in a few nanoseconds (though her perception of time is faster, therefore she has plenty of time). Cibo asks the Authority to at least stop the attack on the village, but it states that they can't do so without an order from someone with the Net Terminal Gene. However, they offer to give her information and coordinates of abandoned levels that the safeguard isn't monitoring. They give her a map of the entire city, information that can't be given to the real world, but they are allowed to let Cibo access it.Meanwhile, the Villagers take account of their losses and injuries, lead by Fusata. Killy returns, and asks a villager to tape his arm back on. Pops thanks him for saving the village from Sanakan. However, the villagers don't know what happened to Cibo and believe that they'll all die in just a few minutes. However, Cibo's arm then shows up, stating that the exterminators will show up again and the village is no longer safe, however, there is an abandoned level just below them with a descending lift nearby.The Villagers decide to abandon their village and make for the descending track to the abandoned level. Along the way, Pops thanks Zuru for taking the kids out hunting, stating that her actions lead to the survival of their people. Once there, Cibo activates the lift, however, a watchtower detects them all and raises a silent alarm to the Safeguard. Suddenly, it starts spawning a massive exterminator close to the villagers who hurry and board the lift. However, Killy stays behind, despite Cibo's objections. Zuru asks Killy what he's doing, and after a long pause, he takes off his necklace and tosses it to her. Tearful, Zuru asks if they'll see him again. After another long pause, Killy responds that he's looking for the Net Terminal Gene. Cibo, realizing he won't come, descends the lift. The massive exterminator then spawns behind Killy and his fires at it with his Gravitational Beam Emitter, causing a massive explosion that engulfs and destroys it while the villagers watch.The narrator then comes back again, stating that was the last they ever saw of him. The narrator reveals herself to be the granddaughter of Zuru, as the villagers had arrived at the abandoned level and were able to create a new village and live in safety. She had been told all about Killy by Zuru, the city hasn't yet changed, meaning that a net terminal gene hasn't been found yet. However, the narrator has faith that Killy is still out there, looking for it.The final shot shows Killy going to the top of a city block, presumably continuing his search until he saves the human race."

As they each begin to adjust to their new life and seek ways to heal their wounds, they both find comfort in newfound romance. Wes meets Lacy, an introverted but fierce girl whose enigmatic personality captivates Wes' attention, and Bill meets Carine, a compassionate and elegant teacher whose own past heartaches resonate with his. As relationships are tested, Bill and Wes grow apart and back together again while discovering their true selves.—Cameron West Bill and Jeanie were together 33 years. It was only 60 days from her diagnosis until her death.One night, Bill walks into the bedroom of his teenage son Wes and says he can't do this any more.With little warning, the Blue '71 Mustang is towing a U-Haul trailer along the Pacific Coast headed toward Los Angeles. Paul, headmaster of St. Martin's, a private boys' school, dated Jeanie before Bill but eventually got over it. Bill has been offered a job teaching math.Bill and Wes move into a house and soon visit the school. Wes has to wear a uniform, and there is one in the lost and found. Paul tells Wes the boys all have to choose a sport, so Wes, who wasn't interested in sports, chooses cross country.Wes is the new kid but he soon makes friends. Girls from Cavalcade Academy come to St. Martin's for some classes. One of the girls is the very pretty Lacy, who is not very social. Wes is in French class with her. Ms. Roussel, the teacher, observes that Wes is one of her best students. This is because his mother was fluent. Lacy is failing so Ms. Roussel asks Wes to tutor her.After one of his classes, Bill is asked by Paul to get therapy since the school will cover it. He thinks Bill has been grieving too long and could use help.At home, Wes watches videos of his mother on his phone. One shows Bill and Jeanie having a picnic, and Jeanie has long red hair. The other shows Jeanie with no hair and her head covered, appearing to say goodbye to Wes and saying how much she loves him. Meanwhile, Bill is in the garage looking at a gigantic painting Jeanie did which is very colorful but does not obviously represent anything.Bill gives Wes the Mustang and starts riding a bike left behind at their house.Wes visits Lacy at home. Lacy is not very nice but she is expected to do this, so she lets Wes help her.Bill works on a garden, intending to grow vegetables to be eaten, and he comments on how much Jeanie liked tomatoes. After therapy, Dr. Rollens prescribed Lexapro but Bill doesn't like the way it makes him feel.On a later visit to Lacy, Wes sees blood on Lacy's arm. Lacy makes him leave and Lacy's younger sister Annabelle introduces herself. She is adorable and sarcastic.Coach Keyes is a jerk but he asks Ms. Roussel to go on a date. She pretends she needs to talk to Bill about a student and asks Bill to play along.Raffi and Gober are Wes' closest friends as they run cross country together. However, Wes is very slow and holds them back. He lets them go on ahead. As they return from a run Ms. Roussel asks Wes how Lacy is doing and Wes tries not to give too much information.After class, Ms. Roussel asks Lacy how she is doing and is very persistent, which causes Lacy to start crying, but it is not clear what is wrong. In several later scenes, Wes sees blood again and figures out Lacy is cutting herself.While Wes is at lunch with Raffi and Gober, Mason, who is a jerk, makes disparaging remarks about Lacy that Wes can't ignore. They fight and Paul gives them detention, and they have to spend time on the weekends picking up litter.Ms. Roussel meets Bill at the pharmacy after Dr. Rollens changes him to Cymbalta. They eventually go on several dates. One date is at a restaurant where the waiter speaks French very well and Bill has no idea what the two are saying.During one of his tutoring sessions with Lacy, Wes is invited to eat with the family. Lacy's mother Barbara is proper but critical. Lacy's father Davis is pleasant but thinks he should be treated better because he pays for everything. Wes learns they are separated but still live in the same house. In a later scene Lacy is comforting Annabelle as their parents fight.Paul and his wife Nancy invite Wes and Bill to a birthday party for Bill, and Wes and Bill both bring dates. Wes and Lacy go parking but Lacy doesn't even want to kiss.On a later visit by Wes, Lacy gives him a front passenger seat for the Mustang, since it didn't have one. Wes can't put it in properly because apparently it was a driver's seat, so anyone who sits there faces backwards. Wes, Lacy and Annabelle have a fun time riding before Wes has to join his friends for litter patrol. Annabelle helps make that fun.Mason comes to Lacy's house at night and calls to her. She is depressed enough that she goes out with Mason and his friends, who play loud music and drink in a van. While they are having fun around a fire, Lacy goes off by herself and calls Ms. Roussel to come get her.Mason brags at school about what he and Lacy supposedly did. Wes comes to Lacy's house and says he will no longer tutor her.After Bill and Ms. Roussel end up in bed, Bill feels guilty and breaks up with her. Dr. Rollens recommends a grief support group.After some time has passed, Bill is teaching his class and can't seem to remember anything. Then he passes out. He ends up in the hospital and Dr. Rollens thinks it is time for desperate measures, including electroshock therapy.After treatment, Bill seems to have given up on life. As he and Wes eat a meal, Wes angrily demands he do something. If he's going to just give up and die, do it now. He went through something like this with his mom, so Wes is ready for all of this to be over.Bill seems to be getting better. The movie alternates between Wes participating in a race and Bill going through some possessions in the garage, with flashbacks to when Jeanie was alive. Bill calls Michael and says the museum would be a great place for all of Jeanie's art. Wes is shown passing other runners. He is in first place at the end and Bill is there to congratulate him.Bill returns to teaching and he is willing to date Ms. Roussel again. Lacy passes French without any further help from Wes, who is interested in spending time with her also. Both couples go for ice cream in the Mustang, with the passenger seat still backwards."

They continue to record random footage for themselves, including Jeff taking medications. Jeff is against recording every little detail at first, especially because the contest is not open to people with medical conditions. However, they continue to record their nights out on town, dinner, and Jeff even attempts to record himself having sex with Megan, to which Megan turns the camera off once again.3 days before their cage dive, Josh, Jeff, and Megan fly to Sydney, Australia where they meet up with Josh and Jeff's cousin, Greg. There, they spend time together on the beach and out on the ocean, allowing the family to reconnect after spending so many years apart. On the final night at Greg's, Greg throws a ""good luck"" party for Josh, Jeff, and Megan. Jeff then records a a confession in a bedroom by himself to the camera that he plans on proposing to Megan on the show. In the middle of the recording, Megan knocks on the door to inform Jeff that their mother has called and is waiting on the line downstairs. Jeff quickly throws a T-Shirt over the camera and runs downstairs to take the call, but the camera continues to record. Megan stays in the room and is met by Josh, and then they begin to kiss, showing they are having an affair behind Jeff's back.1 day before their cage dive, the trio leave Sydney and fly to Adelaide, Australia where the Shark Cage Dive Tour is held. They arrive at their Hotel where they go for a swim at the end of the day before going to bed to get ready for the Tour. After their swim, Jeff shows Josh the footage of his proposal on their computer while Megan is away. Jeff realizes the camera kept recording and before Jeff sees the footage of Josh and Megan kissing, Josh pulls him away from the computer and continues to distract Jeff until the footage is over.The next day, they all head off to the docks for their tour. After some safety instructions, the boat heads out into the water. As the boat is sailing out, they watch a video on the boat about how to Survive A Shark Attack, but Megan is not worried even when Josh is signing a Life Waiver as she points out the large steel cage that they'll be in. After the boat stops at the dive location, another instructor goes over their safety vest information while other crew members begin to attract the sharks with bait. Several tourists are shown entering and leaving the cage, where one person had to leave early due to having a panic attack. Josh, Jeff, and Megan finally enter the cage themselves showing their time underwater where the cage is attacked several times by the Great White's that are circling the boat.Just as they were resurfacing, a giant wave capsizes the boat tipping everyone on-board into the ocean. All 3 of them are able to exit the cage and head back to the surface to meet up with the other survivors, but the sharks are still present. The find they are near a woman who is holding an unconscious man that is bleeding to death from a large open wound on the side of his face. The blood attracts the sharks and the man and woman are killed.Josh, Jeff, and Megan begin to swim away where they see another survivor waving for them. They all begin to swim towards one another but the other person is then killed by sharks too, leaving Josh, Jeff, and Megan by themselves. They begin to wade water until help arrives and Megan realizes she has a cut on her leg. A yacht is sailing nearby and Josh begins to swim for it to get rescued, but Megan prevents him from doing so saying they need to stick together. After a short while, they even hear a helicopter nearby but are distracted by Megan as she says she felt something near her feet. They pull up some of the bait used to attract the sharks and throw it just in time as a shark eats the bait and swims off. Still waiting on rescue, their only saving grace is a single life vest that floats to the surface. Later on, a cooler begins to float a bit further away, and Jeff was going to retrieve it with the hopes of giving them supplies, but the cooler is attacked by more sharks.Night falls upon them and they are still stranded out in the water. But to everyone's delight, they find a life raft where they are supplied with food, first aid, and a couple of flares. Megan fires the first flare in the hopes this will lead to their rescue. While they wait, they fall asleep but are quickly awoken as the raft bumps into another tourist that was floating in the ocean. They pull the tourist into the raft and discover she is still alive but very cold. Megan has the idea of using the second flare to fire another signal and then use the stick as a heat source to warm her up, but Jeff and Josh disagree. Megan persists this will be the best option and Josh and Jeff start to struggle with her to take away the flare. The flare is then fired inside the life raft and the woman they pulled in is burned alive. Now they are left stranded in the ocean once again.It is still nighttime and Josh and Megan begin to argue where Josh accuses Megan of being a liar. The affair is then revealed to Jeff. Their argument is interrupted as sharks have returned due to Megan's leg injury from earlier. She is then pulled underneath the water and is killed by the sharks.The next morning, Josh and Jeff begin to fight and argue over the affair and Megan's death, but Jeff passes out due to not having taken his medications, which is shown to have been for his heart. With little battery left, the footage cuts to Josh recording by himself in his own confession, implying Jeff's body was let go and he is dead. Josh records an apology to Jeff and Megan and a farewell to his family. While recording, a helicopter begins to fly by and Josh frantically begins yelling to the helicopter to be rescued. But before he could be found, a shark swims up and bites Josh, killing him too, and crushing the camera."

It's Jasper Jones, an outcast in the small Western Australian mining town of Corrigan. Rebellious, mixed-race, and solitary, Jasper is for Charlie a distant figure of danger and intrigue. So when Jasper begs for his help, Charlie takes off into the night with him, terrified but desperate to impress. Jasper takes him to a secret glade where Charlie witnesses something terrible: a 16-year-old girl, Laura Wishart, Jasper's girlfriend and the only person he could trust, is hanging dead from a eucalypt tree.
Charlie immediately wants to contact the police. Jasper, however, says they can't. Because of his Aboriginality he is blamed for everything bad that happens in Corrigan and he believes he will surely be blamed for Laura's death. Besides, Jasper tells Charlie, he already knows the murderer's identity: Mad Jack Lionel, the town recluse, a man who it is rumoured killed a woman several years previously and hung her in the local abattoir.
Charlie gives in to Jasper's wishes and together they hide Laura's body, agreeing to keep it a secret and catch the real killer themselves.
Jasper disappears for days and Charlie carries the secret heavily, especially when in the company of Eliza Wishart, his unrequited love and the younger sister of the missing girl. As the townspeople of Corrigan, led by the Sergeant, search for Laura, they get closer to the glade every day.
Charlie struggles to contain what he knows and battles to keep a lid on his over-enthusiastic best friend, the Vietnamese and cricket-loving Jeffrey.
Meanwhile, at home, Charlie's tempestuous mother Ruth dishes out harsh discipline, to which his browbeaten father Wes appears resigned. Charlie feels alone with his secret and his task of helping find evidence to catch the killer. But Jasper reappears at his window one night, they stake out Mad Jack's house together, and Jasper urges Charlie to break in and find the evidence they need.
When the town Sargent finds and interrogates Jasper, Charlie is determined to find the truth and save his new friend. He goes onto Mad Jack Lionel's property and looks for answers. Jasper, meanwhile, escapes the clutches of local police and returns to Charlie's house at night, badly beaten. Jasper is pleased, however, when Charlie offers him the interesting evidence he's found.
In town, things are beginning to look up after Jeffrey, previously bullied and excluded, helps the local junior cricket team win against their archrivals. But their newfound cheer is stripped away when racist locals vandalise Jeffrey's family home.
The night of the town's New Year Fair, Charlie and Jasper decide it is time to act and confront Mad Jack. What they discover is astonishing: Mad Jack is not the killer and he reveals instead a little-known secret about Jasper's parentage - he is Jasper's grandfather. Jasper's father, with whom he has little contact, kept this secret from Jasper to punish Jack for accidentally killing his wife Rosie in a car crash years ago.
Charlie, determined now to tell Eliza what happened to her sister, takes her to the secret glade, but finds that Eliza already knows the truth. Holding a letter from her sister, Charlie and Jasper learn what happened to Laura: her death was a suicide due to her father, a respected town leader, molesting her for years. Jasper, racked with anger and despair, dives into the river. When Jasper doesn't reappear from the water, Charlie dives in, pulling his friend from the dark waters and back to safety."

She mentions that she has panic to fall asleep because everything could change again. White responds with the explanation, that chemical triggers in the brain cause emotions during dreams, which the rational part of the brain uses to construct a story. She insists, that the unknown house was real, but does not want to get in trouble with the resident. Watching a thunderstorm she asks herself, whether she can be rescued and why White helps her. He answers that they are going to stand this together and everything will make sense. Sarah spends the night in his house.

She cannot remember anything, but the data show that she has dream during the whole night. She talks about her last experiences in the other world. White thinks that the stalker might be an anchor connecting the two worlds. When he asks Sarah for the reason for her husband's suicide, she says, that she wrote about it in her diary, but cannot remember the event after her therapy. In front of her apartment, she reads her diary and is not irritated by Nicole arriving at the flat. On a public computer she looks at an old news article saying that the author Jonathan Gray was shot by a crazy fan. She shows the article to White.

At the same evening White meets Cooper who suddenly does not know Sarah and denies having seen White that afternoon. He drives back to the hospital to take Sarah, who is winding in her bed in spite of a strong sedation. White frees her and takes her to his house. There she again shows panic about falling asleep and he tells her about Coopers awkward reaction. Then he lies next to her to help her get into sleep.Sarah awakes with her head on his breast, still in the hospital clothes. In the following talk she states that she now remembers several things. Her stalker is called Warren Lambert and was obsessed with Jonathan, she says. The attack in her flat was not real; White explains it as a memory breaking through. Jonathon, she continues, had a sexual affair with a fan and Sarah witnessed it when she visited him in his office. She broke up with him, but the fan shot him, she says. In Whites dark house, Sarah is attacked by the stalker who tries to suffocate her with a plastic bag from behind. But White comes to help her and knocks the aggressor down. The policeman describes the attacker as a well known criminal and addresses Sarah as Foster. After that, Sarah and White have sex.In the night, Sarah sleepwalks again in her white nightgown. She sees the unknown woman first in the sleep laboratory and then in the house of the dream, where she asks for her name in vain. Through the rain she walks to the lab again. There the unknown woman wakes up seeing Sarah. The other White addresses the woman as ""Sarah"", but does not see Sarah in the nightgown. The normal White comes to Sarah and looks for an explanation. He finds a video statement of the unknown woman, who talks about feeling pursued and a woman standing next to her bed at night. In another flashback Sarah herself shoots Jonathon, who now talks with White's voice. In the lab Sarah says, that she is the other woman's nightmare. White's real version treats this woman, she thinks. But White insists that there must be an explanation. Sarah tells him, that Jonathon was her big love. But she is not his wife, but the other woman and she is called Anna. She shot herself. After this statement she talks to him about love and identity and he thinks they are in an in-between world. She nevertheless is sure that she created him to find out the truth.Then a woman wakes up in the ward for long-term coma of the Los Angeles university hospital. She is wearing an oxygen mask and is bound to the bed. A male nurse who looks like the stalker in the story comes to her. He addresses her as Anna and caresses her face. Water drops are falling on the woman's feet. Afterwards, the sleepwalker can be seen on the street again and she calls herself Sarah Foster."

Alex & The List,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2905082/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Dog trainer Alex is about to propose when his girlfriend gives him a list of changes that she would like him to do. Alex, a lovable, unassuming dog trainer is in love with a great woman - Katherine - smart, talented, from a good family. Katherine adores Alex's quirky sense of humor, honesty and capacity to listen. Having decided to pop the question, Alex is blindsided when Katherine produces a detailed list of well-thought-out ""improvements"" she feels will tweak Alex on their way to becoming the ideal couple. Alex instinctively rejects the suggestion that he needs to change anything. But with the threat of a new competitor, Alex decides to ""do the list."" Guided by a coterie of friends that include: Dave, Alex's loyal childhood buddy, best female friend Lily, her husband Michael, and their 8-year-old son, Nicky, Alex's journey has him reconsider and question his beliefs, values and world.—Harris Goldberg/Kristen D'Alessio Alex Buckingham and Katherine Stern as a couple isn't obvious on the surface. Stylish Katherine, a Jewish princess, is more conventional in nature, while Alex, more comfortable in ripped jeans and a t-shirt in the great outdoors, is somewhat offbeat. While Katherine could probably have any man she wanted, Alex, who has some socialization issues, has had a spottier dating record, he most recently having emailed with Russian Anastasiya, who he met online, for companionship. Part of that problem with socialization is that he uses his best friend Lily's family as his surrogate family, he unable to make a decision without Lily's okay, and treating Lily's adolescent son Nicky almost as his own, which secretly doesn't sit well with Lily's husband Michael, who tolerates it if only for Lily's sake. While Alex believes Katherine's friends are bizarre and pretentious, Katherine believes Alex's best male friend Dave, who he's known since childhood, is crude and doesn't know how to respect personal boundaries. Katherine, who doesn't need to work in being supported by her wealthy father, still aspires to working as a designer, while Alex, a dog trainer, probably would not be able to support Katherine to the style that her father's money has made her accustomed. What makes that last issue worse is that Katherine is allergic to dogs, meaning that she never goes to his place unable to be around his faithful dog, Tucker. Mr. Stern is the one person who does not understand an Alex/Katherine relationship. Lily, Michael and Dave all think Katherine is great, Lily who believes he should hold onto her in she being heads and tails above any other girlfriend he's had. It is in that issue that Alex has to decide how far he will go to please Katherine to hold onto her as he plans to ask her to marry him.—Huggo Katherine Stern (Jennifer Morrison) gives her boyfriend Alex (Patrick Fugit) a list of all the things she wants him to change about himself. He works through the list sidekicked by his best friend, the neurotic single-mom Lily (Karen Gillan).

Maharani Gitanjali Devi (Ileana D'Cruz) from one of the Rajasthan's Princely States has already lost her privy purse. The story revolves around a group of thugs who decide to loot the gold confiscated from Rani Gitanjali, and being transported to Delhi by road.—Khalid During emergency period of 1975 Maharani Gitanjali Devi is held captive in prison for possession of illegal wealth.The wealth is further to be transferred to Delhi from Rajasthan in the guidance of military officer Seher Singh.Sanjeev a powerful politician and rival of Gitanjali is eyeing the wealth.Gitanjali meets her former bodyguard Bhawani Singh and asks him to rob the wealth mid way before it reaches the government.Bhawani along with Sanjana secretary of Gitanjali and his two aides Dalia and Guruji plan the whole robbery. But the day before the robbery could take place all four are found to be suspicious and held in prison.—alex.mjacko@gmail.com Maharani Gitanjali (Ileana D'Cruz) is a princess to a royal family in Rajasthan. As every royal family has loads of gold to themselves, so does this royal family, but her ancestors did not hand it over to the government of the country even after the ancestral reign was over. In 1975, the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi declared the state of emergency in the country. Around the same time, Sanjeev (Priyanshu Chatterjee), an influential person in the Congress government, has been snubbed badly by Gitanjali. To seek revenge, Sanjeev asks army officer Rudra Pratap Singh (Denzil Smith) to confiscate all the gold in Gitanjali's possession and to put her behind bars. Rudra follows Sanjeev's instructions and imprisons Gitanjali after forcibly taking possession of the gold rightfully belonging to the government but still held by her.Rudra asks his trusted lieutenant, Seher Singh (Vidyut Jammwal), to transfer all the gold to Delhi safely to the government and for that, he gives Seher Singh a custom-made truck with a powerful safe in it, in which he keeps all the confiscated gold. As Rudra and Seher Singh are discussing, Sanjana (Esha Gupta), Gitanjali's trusted aide, is sent by her to eavesdrop their conversation and get a whiff of their plan. Gitanjali then plans an entire scheme and wants Sanjana to accompany Bhawani Singh (Ajay Devgn) in getting all the gold back and eventually release her from the jail.Gitanjali briefs Bhawani Singh, her trusted lieutenant, about the gold and how she needs it all back to look after the people in her village. The loyal Bhawani Singh promises to retrieve the gold and return the same to Gitanjali with whom he shares a romantic relationship. Bhawani was the first person to support Gitanjali, after the sudden death of her father, the King.
Bhawani Singh with the support of Daliya (Emraan Hashmi) and Guruji (Sanjay Mishra), besides Sanjana, of course, chalk out an entire plan and seek out on a mission. The four follow the truck in which Seher Singh and his deputy, Somesh (Arjun Dwivedi), are carrying the gold to the Delhi. The group of four, at one point in the journey, takes control of the truck after throwing out Seher Singh and Somesh.
It is revealed that Seher Singh is working on orders of Gitanjali and is also fucking her. They both rejoice that Bhawani has abducted the truck. Turns out that Seher was with Gitanjali ever since she insulted Sanjeev. He got a whiff of the Govt's plans in his battalion and arranged to work directly with Rudra so that he could be assigned the duty of transferring the loot to Delhi. Gitanjali's plan was to have Bhawani steal the loot from Seher, as if anything went wrong then it would be Bhawani that goes to jail. If not, then Gitanjali and Seher would leave the country with the gold and Bhawani would have to deal with the Govt.Seher convinces Rudra to release Gitanjali, as he reckons that Bhawani will try to contact Gitanjali and that's the only way to catch the culprits. But both Gitanjali and Seher abscond once she is released from prison.
The job now is to open the strong safe, something at which Guruji is adept. Meanwhile, Seher Singh, boss Rudra Pratap Singh and other army and police officers are hot on the trail of Bhawani Singh and the truck. Bhawani takes shelter in a village and takes their help to melt the gold into Ignots. He then ditches the truck.
At one point, the army officers seek the help of police officer Durjan (Sharad Kelkar) but Bhawani Singh and his team members outwit him too.But before Bhawani Singh can return the gold to Gitanjali Devi, a very shocking revelation is unveiled in front of him, that Gitanjali used him for her personal pleasure and motives. But Bhawani had anticipated the move (he had seen the evil streak in her before and was beware of her motives) and didn't bring the gold along with him. In the ensuing shootout Seher is killed and Gitanjali marooned in the desert.
In the end it is shown that Bhawani had loaded the gold ingots onto different camels and set them off, by which they reached different villages of Gitanjali's kingdom."

Trench 11,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5033290/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the final days of WWI, an allied army unit led by a shell-shocked soldier is sent to investigate a mysterious abandoned German facility located deep underground. What they find is fate worse than death. In 1918, in the Western Front in France, Lt. Berton, a Canadian tunneler, digs 78 feet beneath a German position to rescue other tunnelers. Berton accidentally startles a survivor who ends up screaming, alerting the Germans above. The Germans then detonate charges above Berton, trapping him underground for twelve days.Three months later, in November 2, 1918, a pair of British Army intelligence officers, Maj. Jennings and Dr. Priest, debrief Col. Ashcroft with intelligence information on a deep underground German bunker called ""Trench 11"", hidden within the Argonne Forest. The base is commanded by a German officer named Reiner (who is called ""The Prophet"" by his men) who specializes in weaponizing various chemicals and diseases. Jennings and Dr. Priest believe that Trench 11 (so named because it is eleven miles behind German lines) is used as a base of operations for Reiner to make more weapons and request for the bunker to be investigated as the Germans failed to destroy it during their retreat. The colonel arranges an American escort (due to the fact that the Argonne Forest is within their sector of the front) and allows Jennings to retrieve Lt. Berton from his leave to help with their investigation. During his leave, Berton enters in a romantic relationship with a French woman named Veronique but is forced to leave when he is retrieved to aid Maj. Jennings' investigation.Berton accompanies Maj. Jennings and Dr. Priest to Trench 11 along with their American escorts: Capt. Cooper, Sgt. Pronger, and Pvt. Kelly. Upon locating Trench 11, the group discover dead German soldiers in the trenches. It is revealed that the German Army had shelled Trench 11 prior to the Allied soldiers arriving there.At the headquarters of the German 5th Army, Gen. Ophuls orders Reiner and Capt. Mueller to erase all evidence of the nature of Trench 11 (called ""Wotan Complex"" in German) to prevent the allies from discovering it as Reiner failed to detonate the explosives inside during their retreat. Mueller, who is disgusted by Reiner's work, is ordered to escort Reiner to the bunker to get the job done.In the trench, the group discover evidence of German infighting and sabotages. Descending underground they come upon a sealed door and a German soldier who was left behind. The soldier frantically begs the group not to open the door but Jennings orders his men to ignore him. The German soldier then hysterically begs and pressures Cooper into shooting him. The group moves deeper into the bunker and are attacked by a crazed man who vomits on Kelly and rips a grenade off Pronger. Berton tosses the grenade away but collapses the tunnel they came from. Jennings orders Berton and Cooper to split and search for an exit while he, Dr. Priest, Pronger and Kelly investigate further down.While searching for an exit Berton and Cooper are ambushed by more crazed men. Cooper is stabbed by one and both are forced to fight them off and flee. Simultaneously Jennings, Priest, Pronger and Kelly discover a hospital room. Pronger is attacked by a crazed man but manages to kill him, alerting the group to a worm crawling out of the gunshot wound. Dr. Priests performs an autopsy on the deceased man and discover the man's body is full of worms and is responsible for his insane and violent behavior. Dr. Priests concludes the worms are not natural and were engineered. Pronger and Kelly stage a mutiny and demand they leave the bunker which ensues a standoff between them and Jennings. The group is then ambushed by German soldiers who kill Pronger and Jennings and take Kelly and Dr. Priest prisoner. Berton and Cooper discover an exit but are also taken prisoner.After losing his tunneler to the infected (whom they needed to reactivate the charges), Mueller decides to recruit the group but Dr. Priest refuses to cooperate. Reiner, who was eavesdropping the whole time, singles out Dr. Priest for interrogation. Kelly's health deteriorates and becomes sick.Reiner interrogates Dr. Priest and tries to get him to relate to his twisted view on science.

Hunter's Point, California. After the teens have a brief encounter with a police officer, The Zodiac Killer murders David Arthur Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen on Lake Herman Road.
Present Day, Virginia. Taking a risk to change his poor financial situation, landscaper Mick Bradley purchases an abandoned storage locker with his pawnbroker friend Harvey. Among the items retrieved from the unit are home movie reels of the Zodiac murders filmed by Zodiac himself. Despite her initial hesitancy, Mick's wife Zoe agrees to help Mick and Harvey investigate the reels in hopes of obtaining a $100,000 reward for information leading to Zodiac's capture.
Meanwhile, Zodiac captures Tina, the woman who manages the storage unit facility, and slits her throat with a knife.
Mick and Zoe break into the storage facility office to find out who rented the Zodiac locker. They discover it was rented under the name Betty Ferguson. After obtaining Betty Ferguson's address, the couple has a brief showdown with a man in the shadows outside.
Mick's trailer park neighbor Ray warns him about pursuing Zodiac.
Mick, Zoe, and Harvey break into the house belonging to Betty Ferguson and her husband Balthazar. While trying to steal another film reel, the trio is confronted at gunpoint by Benjamin Ferguson. Benjamin reveals he is Betty and Balthazar's son. His parents, both in their nineties, actually live in Florida. Benjamin gives Harvey a business card identifying him as an editor at the Tri-County News Ledger. As Benjamin dismisses the trespassers, a nearby neighbor briefly asks if everything is okay.
Harvey spots a cipher key while reviewing one of the film reels. While Harvey uses the key to work on decoding the unsolved Zodiac cipher, Zoe goes to the town hall to research records on Benjamin Ferguson.
Zoe discovers Benjamin's background is consistent with Zodiac's and Benjamin can be placed in San Francisco in the 1960s, where he worked at a newspaper following the Vietnam War. However, Benjamin had already moved to Virginia, as he had been writing investigative articles while pursuing a theory that Zodiac was moving east, at the time Zodiac murdered cabby Paul Stine.
Despite contradictory evidence, Mick continues under the pretense that Benjamin is Zodiac. Zoe becomes concerned with her husband's erratic behavior when strange events begin making Mick paranoid.
Mick and Zoe check in with Harvey, who dismisses them so that he can continue solving the cipher, which will reportedly reveal the Zodiac's name. When the couple returns later, they find Harvey missing, and initially assume he abandoned them to claim the reward money alone.
Mick investigates the space above the pawnshop when he notices something dripping from the ceiling. Zoe sees Harvey's van peeling away outside and, assuming Harvey is trying to get away from them in a hurry, immediately gives chase in Mick's truck. At the same time, Mick discovers Harvey's murdered body upstairs and realizes his wife is in danger.
Mick frantically races to the Ferguson house, where he finds Benjamin dead in his car with his throat cut. Mick also finds a Zodiac cipher written on the car door.
Zoe tracks Harvey's van to a remote farm. When her guard goes down, Zodiac captures her. Zodiac then calls Mick from Zoe's phone with a taunt and a threat to not contact police.
With Zoe held captive, Zodiac explains that he hadn't killed anyone for 40 years. He had followed Ben from San Francisco because he knew Ben was close to uncovering his identity, but grew to enjoy life in Virginia as Ben's unassuming neighbor. Forgetting to make payments on his storage locker compelled Zodiac to resurrect his crime spree to protect his identity.
Mick arrives at the farm for a face-off with Zodiac. Over the course of their confrontation and gun-play, Mick manages to free Zoe. The face-off continues all over the farm until Zoe brings Zodiac to the ground and Mick then shoots him in the throat.
Four weeks later, the FBI and local authorities continue investigating the recent murders. Mick exits the trailer to fix a light and seemingly vanishes. Worried, Zoe goes outside to check on him. An ominous foot sets down in the foreground."

Stratton,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3567666/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A British Special Boat Service commando tracks down an international terrorist cell. A British Special Boat Service (SBS) was created in WWII by the British Navy. It was very effective in neutralizing clandestine enemy positions and was often assigned to work alongside the MI6. It became the basis for the US Military Navy Seals.
John Stratton (Dominic Cooper), is an SBS soldier, working for the Intelligence Detachment in Northern Ireland. Aggy (Gemma Chan), Spinks (Jake Fairbrother) and Cummings (Tom Felton) are mission specialists who are assisting John in infiltrating an Iranian bio-chem weapons factory and to neutralize it. But when john & his partner Marty (Tyler Hoechlin) get there, they find all the workers of the factory shot dead and the bio-chem weapons vault empty. They are late and compromised. They come under attack even as their evacuation is under way and John's partner is shot in the neck during the escape. He dies.Now John lives in Ireland on his boat with Ross (Derek Jacobi) his neighbor and the only friend in the world. Sumner (Connie Nielsen), John's boss in MI6 calls him in and tells him that an unknown amount of WMD stolen from the facility is now in play and she needs him to track down the terrorist behind it. John meets Aggy to look at the video footage of their rescue to figure out who the main man behind their attack was. Hank (Austin Stowell) is assigned to John as his new partner.Sumner identifies the main attacker as Grigory Barovsky (Thomas Kretschmann) who is ex-FSB and was supposed to be dead for 20 yrs. Sumner reveals that 20 years ago Barovsky was a rising FSB agent, so MI6 painted him as a double agent and got the FSB to presumably assassinate their best man. But looks like that wasn't so. Barovsky tests the bio-chem weapons on a community in Ukraine, which kills 150 people in an instant. The weapon is designed to be deployed aerially, where it can cause 100 times the damage with a tiny amount at a height of 1000 ft. Only Tariq Alawi (Igan Naor) is a bomb maker, specialized enough to turn raw bio-chem into a bomb version that can be deployed from a plane.The team abducts Alawi, who admits that he already weapon activated the bio-chem now called Satan's snow. Alwai is forced to reveal the next link to Barovsky, by the name of
Greco, an Italian engineer (Rinat Khismatouline). They find that Greco has engineered the design provided by Alawi and created a areal dispersion drone prototype for Satan's snow. When Barovsky comes to pick up the drone, he finds the cameras installed by Hank & John & thinks Greco is double crossing him. So he kills Greco & tries to leave with the drone. Hank disobeys orders from John and attacks Barovsky. They get the drone, but Barovsky escapes.John theorizes that Barovsky already has 3 other drones already delivered to him. John meets Sumner & discusses how Sergei (Olegar Fedoro) was Barovsky's boss when FSB gave the order to shoot him. John tells Sumner that Sergei perhaps didn't shoot Barovsky and instead used him now (when Sergei is the Minister of Interior) to compromise Britains Iram mission that would have put 2 dead Brits inside Iranian space and led to international scandal from which Moscow would profited handsomely. But Barovsky went rouge, kills Sergei, and keeps the bio-chem for his own profit rather than handing it over to Moscow.
John also asks Sumner about her past relationship with Barovksy. Sumner admits that she fell in love with him when she was assigned to the mission of proving Barovsky as a double agent.Turns out while killing Sergei, Barovksy stole the file on all his foreign agents, which included Cummings. Barovsky now contact Cummings to steal the 4th drone and deliver it back to him, else he would expose Cummings as a Russian agent to Sumner.
Sumner suspects that Barovsky could decide to attack Moscow with Satan's Snow to extract his revenge. Cummings pitches to Sumner to share this intel with the FSB in exchange for an US hostage in Russia. Sumner agrees, but when John & Hank head there, they find that the exchange is not the US hostage (didn't have a tattoo at the right place). They shoot the FSB imposters & return. They finally deduct that Cummings is the infiltrator in their group. They are confused as to why Barovsky would go to such lengths for a drone that he doesn't even need.Meanwhile Cummings goes missing. Spinks finally cracks the guidance system on the 4th drone and figures out that the target is not Moscow, but London. Sumner tracks & finds the ship through which Barovksy is entering London with the other 3 drones. She orders John to intercept. They do, & recover 2 drones, but Barovsky still escapes with the last one. Meanwhile Cummings abducts Aggy, & takes her to a warehouse & shoots himself. Shortly thereafter Barovsky enters the warehouse with the last drone. The warehouse has a London bus inside, which Aggy uses to hide. he loads the drone on the bus.
Aggy helps John & Hank track the bus down in downtown London. They manage to stop the bus, kill Barovksy and neutralize the agent before Barovksy could release it.
Later, John asks Aggy out for a date."

Slowly, Haseena gets into the property business herself, so much so that without her permission no one could even sell their property without paying a fee to Haseena Parkar.

The Last Prosecco,2017,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6873546/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The film follows Inspector Stucky investigating a series of murders and the theatrical suicide of Desiderio Ancillotto, a count who lives in the hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, in a story that recounts the conflict between greed and respect for the land. The story unravels on the rolling hills where Prosecco grapes are grown; a winemaker Count, fighting to protect his territory, a half Italian half Persian police inspector who is more stubborn than a thick fog; the manager of a cement plant who on a rainy night falls in the mud forever, killed by three gunshots; and a crazy man who scrapes the rust from the tombs in the cemetery, chatting blessings.
A thriller that tells us about the lure of the land, the effervescence of bubbles, the conflict between greed and respect.
A story about the inheritance of beauty and the value of quality.
In 2010, north-east Italy began to feel a recession which nobody had expected. Only one productive sector resisted. Actually it thrived: Prosecco.
It grew like it is growing now, a double-figure growth, like the Chinese economy.
So I said to myself: why not try to tell the story of this archipelago of bubbles? Thirty rolling miles of hills, vineyards, wine casks and work.
And when you study it, when you listen, when you walk there, you discover the intricate weaving of a world: love for the land but pesticides too, wine knights but also mercenaries of greed.
So the novel, as well as the film, is a chance to insert inspector Stucky between Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, among hamlets and abbeys, with a following of wine- makers, Prosecco Brotherhoods and village oddballs. To find out who killed the manager of a cement plant on whose walls someone had written: ""Dust you were and dust you will become again"".
A chance to narrate an incredible land that I love, enchanted places; and the world of wine, both symbolic and fascinating, through a detective story with a fizz, as light as helium. To remember that anyone who destroys the land destroys the future for everyone."
