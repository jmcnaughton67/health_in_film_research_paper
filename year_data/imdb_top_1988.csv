Rain Man,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a selfish L.A. yuppie learns his estranged father left a fortune to an autistic-savant brother in Ohio that he didn't know existed, he absconds with his brother and sets out across the country, hoping to gain a larger inheritance. Charles Sanford ""Charlie"" Babbit is a self-centered Los Angeles-based automobile dealer/hustler/bookie who is at war with his own life. Charlie, as a young teenager, used his father's 1949 Buick convertible without permission and as a result, he went to jail for two days on account that his father reported it stolen. It is then that Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the car while the remainder will of $3 Million goes into a trust fund to be distributed to someone. Charlie seemed pretty angry by this and decides to look into this matter. It seems as if that ""someone"" is Raymond, Charlie's unknown brother, an autistic savant who lives in a world of his own, resides at the Walbrook Institute. Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get the $3 Million inheritance. Raymond's acts and nagging, including repeated talks of ""Abbott & Costello"", ""Four minutes till Wapner"" and refusal to fly on an airline except Qantas drives Charlie insane... and out of his selfish world into a cross-country trek of pure love and understanding that these two both have.—Christopher Howell (Ckhowell75360@aol.com) When car dealer Charlie Babbitt learns that his estranged father has died, he returns home to Cincinnati, where he discovers that he has an autistic older brother named Raymond and that his father's $3 million fortune is being left to the mental institution in which Raymond lives. Motivated by his father's money, Charlie checks Raymond out of the facility in order to return with him to Los Angeles. The brothers' cross-country trip ends up changing both their lives.—Jwelch5742 Charlie is a hustler. He's been on his own long enough to know how to work people and situations. He finds that the father who threw him out as a teen ager has died. He's left him a now antique convertible and something more important, a previously unknown brother, Raymond. Raymond is autistic, but is able to calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head with great speed and accuracy. Their father has left his fortune to Raymond who doesn't even understand what money is for. Charlie is enraged by what has happened and by his father keeping Raymond's existence from him for his entire life. He kidnaps Raymond from his residential home but then finds that Raymond will only fly Qantas. The two begin a long road trip that will lead them to an understanding of each other.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), a Los Angeles car dealer in his mid-twenties, is in the middle of importing four grey market Lamborghinis. The deal is being threatened by the EPA, and if Charlie cannot meet its requirements for pollution control, he will lose a significant amount of money. After some quick subterfuge with an employee, Charlie leaves for a weekend trip to Palm Springs with his girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino).Charlie's trip is cancelled by news that his estranged father, Sanford Babbitt, has died. Charlie travels to his hometown in Cincinnati, Ohio, to settle the estate, where he learns an undisclosed trustee is inheriting $3 million on behalf of an unnamed beneficiary, while all he is to receive is a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible and several prized rose bushes -- all of which are dying from neglect. Eventually he learns the money is being directed to Wallbrook, a mental institution which is the home of his autistic older brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), of whose existence Charlie was previously unaware. We learn that Charlie grew up a rebellious child and that following the death of his mother, he ran away from home at age 16 to California where he lived ever since, never speaking to his father ever again. Prior to his flight to California, Charlie had taken the Roadmaster out on his 16th birthday without his father's permission. His father subsequently called the police, reported the car stolen, and Charlie and his friends were picked up by the police. Charlie's father allowed the police to hold his son in jail for two days (the friends he was driving with had been bailed out by their own parents within hours). This leads Charlie to ask the question that permeates the movie: ""Why didn't somebody tell me I had a brother?""Although Raymond has autism, he is high-functioning and also has superb memory recall, but little understanding of subject matter thus making him an ""overgrown child"". He is frightened by change and adheres to strict routines (for example, his continual repetition of the ""Who's on First?"" sketch whenever he becomes nervous or agitated) and has regimented mealtimes and outings. Except when he is in distress, he shows little emotional expression and avoids eye contact and is frightened of most physical contact. Numbed by learning that he has a brother and determined to get what he believes is his fair share of the Babbitt estate, Charlie effectively kidnaps Raymond -- who has always been a voluntary resident -- from Wallbrook. Charlie quickly becomes frustrated with Raymond's behavior and finds out that Raymond won't get on a plane to LA: Raymond recalls statistics of crashes with every airline (except Qantas) and has a severe anxiety attack where he hits himself in the head and screams uncontrollably when Charlie tries to force him to board. Charlie has no choice but to drive back to LA in the Buick. Charlie is also forced to avoid major highways when the two pass an accident, extending the driving time of the journey.Charlie intends to start a custody battle in order to get Raymond's doctor, Dr. Bruner (Jerry Molen), to settle out of court for half of Sanford Babbitt's estate so that the mental institution can maintain custody of Raymond. During the course of the long journey, Charlie learns about Raymond's autism, which he initially believes is curable resulting in his frequent frustration with his brother's antics. He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was left alone with Raymond when Charlie was a baby, about 20 months old and Raymond was age 10. Raymond also sings ""I Saw Her Standing There"" by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was three or four years old. Charlie remembers the incident as early as he could remember and always thought that the person singing to him, (whom the young Charlie referred to as the 'Rain Man' due to Raymond's slow-speaking of his own name) was an imaginary character. While Charlie and his brother reminisce about their relationship, Charlie turns on the hot water in the hotel room bathtub -- Raymond suddenly has an episode where he hits himself and screams, yelling that the hot water will burn Charlie if he touches it. Charlie realizes that Raymond had tried to give his younger brother a bath and had scalded him, prompting their parents to send Raymond to Wallbrook.Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he uses Raymond's precision memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. Casino security begins to watch Charlie and Raymond, though they can't find any proof that either is using a cheater's system to win against the house so Charlie can pay off his considerable debts back in LA. Security sends an attractive woman who finds Raymond alone in the casino's bar. She is able to get Raymond to allude to his and Charlie's counting of cards. Later, in their hotel suite, Raymond mentions the ""date"" he'd made with the woman. Charlie suggests that Raymond will have to dance with her and he shows Raymond how to properly dance with a woman. The two share a brotherly and friendly moment until Charlie tries to hug Raymond, who shrieks in fright.Shortly after, security asks to speak to Charlie privately and suggests that Charlie take his winnings, about $80,000 and leave. Charlie agrees. Susanna meets Charlie and Raymond at the hotel and she & Charlie reconcile -- they'd had a falling out just as the journey from Cincinnati had begun over Charlie's cold treatment of his brother. While she escorts Raymond back up to the suite, she kisses Raymond.In the end, Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to truly love him. Back in Los Angeles, Charlie meets with his attorney Boros (Adam S. Gottbetter) to try to get his share of his inheritance, but then decides that he no longer cares about the money and really just wants to have custody of his brother. However, at a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist and Dr. Bruner, Raymond is unable to decide exactly what he wants (to live with Charlie in California or stay at the mental hospital in Ohio). Eventually, the psychiatrist presses Raymond to make the decision, upsetting him and leading Charlie to request that the doctor back off. Raymond is allowed to go back home to Cincinnati. Charlie, who has gained a new brother and mellowed considerably, promises Raymond as he boards an Amtrak train with Bruner that he'll visit in two weeks."
Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A toon-hating detective is a cartoon rabbit's only hope to prove his innocence when he is accused of murder. 'Toon star Roger is worried that his wife Jessica is playing pattycake with someone else, so the studio hires detective Eddie Valiant to snoop on her. But the stakes are quickly raised when Marvin Acme is found dead and Roger is the prime suspect. Groundbreaking interaction between the live and animated characters, and lots of references to classic animation.—Jon Reeves <jreeves@imdb.com> It's the story of a cartoon character named Roger Rabbit who exists along side of real humans. Eventually, it is revealed that Marvin Acme, the owner of the Acme Company and of Toontown, has been murdered! But all fingers point to Roger Rabbit, a Toon star at Maroon Cartoons. But unfortunately the only person who can prove Roger's innocence is Toon hating Eddie Valiant, a washed-up, alcoholic private detective who is reluctantly forced into helping when Roger hides in his apartment. It's up to Eddie to clear Roger's name and find the real evildoer before the villainous, power-hungry Judge Doom goes on a mission to bring Roger to justice!—Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> Detective Eddie Valliant has hated toons since his brother was killed by one, but now he has to help a toon that was framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, owner of Acme Corporations and Toontown, for playing patty-cake with the toon's wife. On the way, they have to avoid a suspicious character who wants to destroy all toons using a chemical that disintegrates everything.—Anonymous It is 1940's Los Angeles. In a world were Humans and Cartoons co-exist. A famous toon known as Roger Rabbit has life easy, until he discovers that his wife, Jessica Rabbit is having fun with the head of Maroon Cartoons, then things take a turn for the worse for Roger as he is know accused of murdering Mr. Maroon. Roger turns to a down and out detective named Eddie Valiant, who has a vendetta for toons. He helps Roger (against his own will), escape from an uncompromising Judge Doom, and even try to clear Roger's name, in order to do this, he must travel all over L.A. and even into Toontown.—John Wiggins Former toon Private Eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is called to the Maroon Cartoon Studios lot at the request of its owner, R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern). Maroon is upset that one of the studio's biggest stars, Roger Rabbit, has already put the latest Baby Herman cartoon over-budget by $25,000. Maroon chalks Roger's acting mistakes up to him being worried about his wife, Jessica. Recent newspaper articles have circulated rumors that Jessica is seeing someone else. Maroon assigns Valiant to get pictures to confirm this rumor. When Valiant claims he doesn't work in Toontown, Maroon tells him that Jessica performs at a club in Los Angeles called 'The Ink and Paint Club.' Valiant accepts the assignment for $100, of which Maroon pays $50 upfront, and the other half promised upon completion of the assignment.Later that evening, Valiant goes to the Ink and Paint Club, where he encounters Toontown's owner and 'gag king, Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) in the audience. Acme playfully squirts ink on Valiant's shirt, which infuriates the Private Eye, until it is revealed that the ink is 'disappearing ink.' Shortly afterwards, the show starts, and Valiant is shocked to find that Jessica is not really a rabbit, but a shapely toon woman. After the show, Valiant sneaks out the back to a window, and sees Jessica in her dressing room, with Marvin Acme, playing pattycake.Valiant takes pictures, and shows them to Roger and Maroon in the Studio Head's main office. Infuriated by the photos, Roger claims that he and his wife will be happy again, and bolts from the office.The next day, Valiant is awoken by Lieutenant Santino (Richard LeParmentier), who has come to inform him that Marvin Acme was killed the night before. Currently, Roger is the prime suspect, given what he said to Maroon and Valiant. At the Acme Gag Factory, Valiant is introduced to Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), and his gang of Weasels that run his 'Toon Patrol' gang. Having jurisdiction over Toontown, the judge explains to Valiant that in order to 'rein in the insanity,' he has resorted to a new method on which toons can be killed: The Dip, a mixture of turpentine, acetone, and benzine. The Judge demonstrates the Dip to Valiant at the Gag Factory, when he dips and obliterates a squeaking toon shoe.Valiant returns to his office, only to find Baby Herman waiting for him. Herman pleads with the detective that Roger is innocent, and that Acme was most likely 'bumped off' because he owned Toontown. Acme had once made a solemn oath that he would leave Toontown in the ownership of the toons if anything happened to him, according to Herman. However, while there is talk that Acme had a will that stipulated this, noone has ever seen it.Valiant goes into his office, and after glancing at one of the pictures of Jessica and Acme, notices that in Acme's coat pocket, is a piece of paper that says 'last will and testament.' Settling down for a small nap, Valiant finds Roger is hiding in his bed. Roger it seems, was able to find Valiant's office, but not after asking a number of people for help. However, it is most likely that since he's a wanted rabbit, someone has most likely told the Toon Patrol about his whereabouts. Valiant tries to get rid of Roger, but the rabbit pleads with the detective to take his case and help clear his name.Roger explains that after he got upset about the pictures, he went to the Ink and Paint Club to see Jessica. Not finding her in her dressing room, he wrote her a love letter on a piece of paper that was lying around. He waited for her to appear, but when the weasels showed up looking for him, he took the love letter and ran away. Valiant wonders just why Roger would come to him, seeing as how he took the pictures of Roger's wife. Roger explains because of Valiant's past career of helping toons.At one point, Roger gets a bit carried away, and accidentally handcuffs himself to Valiant. It doesn't help that Valiant has no keys to the cuffs, and the weasels have shown up looking for Roger. Valiant pretends to be washing his laundry in the sink when they arrive, and after the weasels leave, Roger emerges from the sink. Valiant then goes across the street to the Red Car Trolley Station, where his girlfriend Dolores (Johanna Cassidy) is working at a restaurant. She allows them both into a hidden room at the rear of the restaurant, where Valiant gets the handcuffs off, and tells them that he believes that Acme's death was set-up by R.K. Maroon, and that Maroon wants to get control of Toontown. Valiant has Roger stay in the hidden room, while he goes back to his office. Meanwhile, Valiant sends Dolores downtown to check the probate of Acme's will.After taking a shower, he emerges to find Jessica has come into the office, asking for help finding Roger. Valiant claims that she most likely needs Roger to 'make the scheme work,' but Jessica claims that she does love her husband, and that her 'figure' often leads to speculation of her being 'bad.' Jessica further goes onto explain that the pictures that Valiant took were set-up. Maroon had wanted to blackmail Acme, and promised Jessica that if she didn't go along with his scheme, Roger would never work in pictures again. Caring for her husband, she allowed herself to go along with the scheme.Shortly afterwards, Dolores shows up, and explains that Valiant's theory is incorrect. Maroon appears to have no intentions of obtaining Toontown. According to the probate, a company called Cloverleaf Industries put in a bid for the rights to Toontown, and at midnight, they will have ownership unless Acme's will turns up. It also happens that Cloverleaf Industries also recently claimed ownership of the Red Car Trolley Line. Valiant and Dolores return to the restaurant, only to find Roger dancing about to the amusement of the guests. Valiant throws Roger and himself into the hidden room, just before Judge Doom and his weasels appear. Everyone in the room denies that Roger was there, but Doom gets him to appear by tapping and singing 'Shave and a haircut.' According to Doom, no toon can resist this song, without finishing it with 'two bits.' As expected, Roger appears, and is then accosted by Doom. Valiant saves the rabbit by offering him a drink. Roger's inability to hold his alcohol, turns his head into a giant steam whistle. Valiant knocks out the weasels, and rushes out of the bar with Roger leading the way.Tryring to use the weasel's Toon Patrol wagon, they encounter a cartoon cab named Benny in the rear of the car. Valiant and Roger then use Benny to escape from the weasels. Benny deposits them at a theater, where Roger is enjoying the 'Goofy' cartoon playing on the screen, but Valiant is still upset. Roger, who has grown perplexed at Eddie's attitude, asks what happened to turn him into such a 'sourpuss.'Valiant then explains that his partner and brother, Teddy, was killed by a toon. Many years ago, while investigating a robbery at the First National Bank of Toontown, Eddie and Teddy were chasing a guy who dropped a piano on them from 13 stories up. The piano broke Eddie's arm, but killed Teddy. Valiant never did find out who the toon was, except that he had 'burning red eyes' and a 'high squeaky voice.' Roger feels terrible about this, and sobs that Eddie is justified in his hatred of him and toons. Eddie claims he doesn't hate Roger, and the toon rabbit is overjoyed.On their way out of the theater, a newsreel plays footage of Cloverleaf Industries executives making a deal with R.K. Maroon, and Valiant thinks he's finally found the 'connection!' Valiant places a call to R.K. Maroon, telling him he has the will, as a way to get in to see the Studio Owner. Arriving at the studios, Roger is told to stay by the car.Valiant meets with Maroon, who seems very nervous about the whole thing. Valiant uses Roger's love-letter as a ploy to throw Maroon off-guard, and then knocks the Studio Owner to the floor, wanting answers. When Maroon denies any wrongdoing, Valiant runs his tie through a movie-o-la, almost strangling him. Maroon explains that he had a chance to sell his studio, but Cloverleaf also wanted Acme's property as well. When Marvin refused, Maroon planned to blackmail him with pictures of him (Acme) and Jessica. Maroon then goes on to try and explain more, when suddenly gunfire erupts, and Maroon is wounded. Valiant goes to the window where the shots came from, only to see Jessica running away.Valiant returns to his car, only to find Roger gone. Giving chase, he follows Jessica's car but stops when it drives into the tunnel leading to Toontown. Valiant arms himself with a toon gun (complete with toon bullets), and heads into Toontown. After a series of madcap hijinks through the toon city, Valiant finds himself in an alley, with Jessica pulling a gun on him. However, the bullet she fires streaks right past him. When she approaches, she points to a gun on the ground behind him. Apparently, Doom was planning to shoot Valiant, and her bullet saved his life. This is the same gun that was used to kill R.K. Maroon. Far off in the distance, the two see Doom running away, claiming that they're 'all dead.'Jessica and Valiant try to get Valiant's car to give chase, but it appears to be gone. As well, roger has disappeared from Jessica's trunk (apparently, she had knocked him out and put him in the trunk to keep him from getting hurt). Both Jessica and Valiant manage to thumb a ride from Benny, who helps them escape from Toontown. In the car, Jessica tells Valiant that Acme knew Doom was after Toontown, and gave her the will for safekeeping. However, the envelope containing the will only held a blank sheet of paper.On the other side of the tunnel, Doom is waiting with a barrel of Dip, that ends up flattening Benny's tires, causing him to crash. Doom then has Valiant and Jessica taken to the Acme Factory. The two are frisked for the will, but nothing is found. It is then that Doom explains his master plan. Planning to end his career as a Toontown judge, he is now going to take advantage of his stake in Cloverleaf Industries (of which he is the sole stockholder). Pulling aside a giant cloth, he shocks Jessica and Valiant with a giant Dipmobile, containing enough dip to wipe out Toontown in a matter of minutes. Doom's master plan is to build a freeway in its place: a concept that will allow high-speed driving, and end traffic jams. Valiant balks at this, saying that people can still take the Red Car Trolley Line for a nickel. It is then that Doom reveals that his purchasing of the Trolley Line was part of his plan, as he plans to dismantle the transportation system, making people have no alternative but to use his freeway system.Just then, Roger bursts through a sewer pipe, but is quickly subdued. Doom has both Roger and Jessica hung at the far end of the room, planning to 'dip' them. As he confidently walks away, he trips on some spilled gag eyeballs and falls to the ground. Angered at the weasel's laughing, he angrily shouts, 'One of these days, you idiots are gonna laugh yourselves to death!' As he disappears around a corner, Valiant manages to distract the weasels, by tumbling, falling, and using some Acme gags nearby. His lunacy causes the weasels to do just as the judge promised, and they all die laughing. However, one of the weasels, Psycho, had turned on the dipmobile's cannon, which is heading right for Roger and Jessica. Valiant manages to abort the cannon's direction, but not before being knocked about by Judge Doom. During the scuffle, Doom ends up getting his hand and foot coated in a super-strong glue, and soon ends up under the front of an Acme steamroller. Screaming at his predicament, he is severely flattened. However, he suddenly rises off the floor, hopping about. Valiant makes the correct assumption that the Judge was actually a toon. Re-inflating himself, Doom reveals who he really is: the toon that many years ago killed Teddy Valiant. Doom then starts the dipmobile back up, and then proceeds to kill Eddie with a giant toon buzzsaw. However, Eddie opens a rear valve on the dipmobile, sending a wall of dip on Doom, causing him to melt into a puddle of paint.With the dip spent, Roger and Jessica are saved, as the dipmobile then crashes through the wall, creating an opening into Toontown, where the dipmobile is hit by a fast-moving train.After Eddie manages to clear the Gag Factory's floor of dip, Roger and Jessica are lowered to the ground, just in time for Benny to return with the police, Dolores, and Lt. Santino. Eddie explains that it was actually Doom who killed Marvin Acme, as well as R.K. Maroon, and his brother Teddy. All the toons of Toontown arrive to see the carnage and comment about the death of their would-be murderer. As Baby Dolores complains their town is still in danger of being demolished by another developer, Delores notices a stain on Eddie's shirt, it appears that the ink that Acme squirted him with, according to Roger, was 'disappearing and reappearing' ink. Getting an idea, Eddie returns the love letter to Roger, who begins to read it. As Roger reads the letter, a number of words begin to appear, and Eddie's hunch is correct: The blank piece of paper that Roger found in Jessica's dressing room, was Acme's will, written in invisible ink, and as promised, the will gives ownership of Toontown to the toons!Having noted Valiant's funny dance for the weasels, Roger asks Eddie if he has gotten over being a sourpuss. When Eddie mentions that 'only time will tell,' Roger offers to shake his hand...but failing to mention a hand-buzzer that shocks Eddie! Eddie pulls his hand away, with an angry look. ""Don't tell me you've lost your sense of humor already,"" says a fearful Roger. Eddie then grabs him by the neck and asks, ""Does this answer your question?"" Eddie's 'answer' is a cartoony kiss to Roger's lips...proof that Eddie has gotten his sense of humor back!Eddie, Dolores, Roger and Jessica then walk off towards Toontown, as a number of cartoon characters sing the song, 'Smile, darn ya, smile!' Meanwhile, Porky Pig is among the Toon cops clearing the scene and realizes he has found a good line to end the story, ""That's All, Folks!"" as he address the audience just before Tinkerbell flies in to tap the scene in her own tradition to bring this unique film collaboration to a close."

Many years ago, an experiment was conducted to produce a perfect human being. Unfortunately, there was a serious problem. The zygote split unevenly leaving two children - one with strength, brains, personality and love and the other one with what else was left! Both children were raised separately at different locations until one day, the two unite and help each other find their long-lost mother.—Michael Feller <reb@magna.com.au> Julius and Vincent Benedict are fraternal twins; the results of a secret experiment carried out at a genetics laboratory to produce the perfect child, using sperm donated by six different fathers. The mother, Mary Ann Benedict was told that the children died at birth, while the children were informed once old enough that their mother died in childbirth. Accepting this, Mary Ann had gone on to become a successful artist. While successful, the program was considered a failure and shut down because of the conception of the twins, one inheriting the ""desirable traits"", and the other being the ""genetic trash"".Vincent (DeVito) was placed in an orphanage run by nuns in Los Angeles, California whilst Julius (Schwartzenegger) was taken to an unnamed South Pacific island and raised by Professor Werner (one of the scientists involved in the experiment) like a modern Doc Savage to become highly intelligent, physically very strong and spiritually pure. He learned to speak twelve languages, and excelled in mathematics, history, science and literature. He was not told about his younger brother until his 35th birthday.[1]In Los Angeles, with no-one but himself to rely on, Vincent escaped from the orphanage as soon as he was old enough and developed into a shady lowlife, involved in shady business deals and car theft and in debt to the notorious loan sharks, the Klane brothers. He is also a womanizer and a smart aleck with a lust for money. Eventually, his debts catch up with him and he is arrested for unpaid parking fines.Julius is told about his unknown brother by Werner, and comes to Los Angeles to look for him. Highly intelligent, but extremely naïve about the real world his more worldly brother inhabits, he bails Vincent out of jail, but is immediately afterwards snubbed by Vincent, who leaves him in the prison car park. Julius, however, tracks Vincent to his workplace, where he is being beaten by one of the Klane brothers, Morris, for the unpaid debt. Julius easily bests Morris and earns Vincent's respect and trust. He eventually meets Vincent's on-off-on girlfriend, Linda Mason. Knowing little about women, Julius doesn't understand the flirtatious advances of her blonde sister Marnie (who dislikes Vincent), but eventually falls in love with her. Vincent soon reveals to Julius a document he stole from the orphanage when he ran away that proves that her mother is in fact still alive, yet Vincent, under the belief that his mother abandoned him at birth, shows no interest in tracking her down. Julius, however, finds their mother's address on the document and pays the place a visit. While their mother is not there, Julius meets one of his six fathers, who fills him in on the experiment and informs him of the other scientist, Mitchell Traven, who might know where their mother is.Using a stolen Cadillac that carries a secret prototype fuel injector, which Vincent is delivering to a rival industrialist in Houston, Texas in exchange for five million dollars which he intends to use to pay the money he owes to the Klane brothers, the two couples go on a cross-country journey to track Traven down. They eventually find Traven in Los Alamos, New Mexico, who tells them that their mother is living in an art colony near Santa Fe. On the way to the colony, they're found at a bar by the Klane brothers, with the intent of killing Vincent, but Julius and Vincent beat them back and fight them off for the last time. Reaching the colony, they're informed their mother died and leave. In reality, the woman who told them of the passing is in fact their mother, but she didn't believe the story, fearing they were land speculators and since she didn't even know she had twins. Little do they know that the real contract delivery man for the injector, Mr. Webster, is tracking them. This man has the uncomfortable habit of killing the people who cross him in his business (including his contractors) if they see his face, in order to preserve his identity. At one point earlier on in the film, Webster breaks into Vincent's house in intercept him, crossing paths with the Klane brothers. In a skirmish, he shoots two of them in the legs but does not kill them.While Julius seems to accept their mother's death, Vincent however is angry and disappointed, taking it out on Linda and Julius. Vincent storms off, leaving Julius and the girls stranded in New Mexico to deliver the engine to the industrialist, Beetroot McKinley. Linda informs Julius of the engine, and Julius embarks on another journey to track his brother down. Vincent eventually delivers the stolen property to McKinlely, but as Vincent is about to return home with the money, McKinley is shot and killed by Webster, who then turns his attention to Vincent just as Julius arrives. A cat-and-mouse chase ensues and Julius intercepts Webster as Vincent flees, but Vincent, hearing his brother's voice, reluctantly goes back and gives up the money to Webster. But as Webster prepares to kill them both for seeing his face, Julius stalls Webster long enough for Vincent to release a heavy chain onto Webster's head, killing him and burying him in a mountain of chains. Julius and Vincent make amends, and Vincent reluctantly agrees to return the money and the stolen engine to the authorities, but Vincent secretly skims off one million. Meanwhile, the twins' publicity reaches the art colony, and their mother realises that the two ""comedians"" who visited her were in fact her long lost sons.Julius and Vincent return the money (Vincent keeps 1 million for himself), marry the Masons, and use the $50,000 reward money to start up a legitimate consulting business, utilizing Julius's knowledge and Vincent's questionable business savvy. Their mother eventually tracks them down to their office and they share a tearful reunion. In the end, both brothers end up having pairs of twins with their respective wives, their mother and Professor Werner as a big happy family."

Die Hard,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A New York City police officer tries to save his estranged wife and several others taken hostage by terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles. NYPD cop John McClane goes on a Christmas vacation to visit his wife Holly in Los Angeles where she works for the Nakatomi Corporation. While they are at the Nakatomi headquarters for a Christmas party, a group of robbers led by Hans Gruber take control of the building and hold everyone hostage, with the exception of John, while they plan to perform a lucrative heist. Unable to escape and with no immediate police response, John is forced to take matters into his own hands.—Sam New York City policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and his daughter and son Christmas Eve. He joins her at a holiday party in the headquarters of the Japanese-owned business she works for. But the festivities are interrupted by a group of terrorists who take over the exclusive high-rise, and everyone in it. Very soon McClane realizes that there's no one to save the hostages -- but him.—ahmetkozan John McClane, a New York City cop flies to LA to visit his wife at a Christmas party. But when twelve terrorists attack the building the same night, McClane is the only hope of saving everybody. With nothing but a handgun and his wits, he is forced to take on Hans Gruber and his fellow terrorists.—daniel lacey In the midst of the corporate executive Christmas party on Christmas Eve, NYPD detective John McClane arrives direct from the airport to the Nakatomi Corporation headquarters in Los Angeles so that he can spend Christmas with his two children, his wife Holly who is the successful number 2 at the company. While they still love each other, John never supported Holly's move to Los Angeles, Holly assuming her maiden surname of Gennaro, about which John was unaware until now, and he not staying with them indicative of the strained state of their marriage. While John is cleaning up in one of the executive washrooms, a dozen or so heavily armed men ambush the party, those in the room assuming they being terrorists against some aspect of the company, whether it be their corporate policy or their ties to Japan, only two of the many possibilities. Out of his element, John believes the best way to save who end up being the hostages at the party and himself is not to make himself known to the assailants, until he discovers who they are and what they want, they who seemed to be aware of everyone who was supposed to be in the building, such as security guards, he not among those known. The assailants also seemed to have organized it so that not only has all communication having been cut in and out of the building, their only communication with each other being through their own radios, but if any communication is made specifically to the LAPD that such communication would be deemed crank calls by the police. While John can only keep himself unknown to the assailants for so long in a kill or be killed scenario, John has to hope that he can keep one step ahead of the assailants and that they don't discover his identity, especially that Holly, one of the hostages, is his wife. The one wild card, at least known to John, is Argyle, the hipster limo driver on his first job organized by the company, in the underground parking garage, he waiting for John's call about if his service as said driver is required further that evening.—Huggo John McClane, a detective with the New York City Police Department, arrives in Los Angeles to attempt a Christmas reunion and reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is attending a party thrown by her employer, the Nakatomi Corporation, at its still-unfinished American branch office headquarters, the high-rise Nakatomi Plaza. McClane is met at the airport by Argyle, a limo driver charged with taking John to Holly's office. Argyle quickly deduces that McClane has come to LA to patch things up with Holly and offers to park the limo in the building's garage for a short time until McClane figures out his accommodations. As he enters the lobby, he finds that the building's staff directory is an automated computer program listing Holly under her maiden name, Gennaro. When he gets off the elevator on the 30th floor, he sees a lavish holiday party is underway. John is met by Holly's boss, Joseph Takagi, a genial Japanese businessman. After McClane refreshes himself from the flight in Holly's corporate bathroom, they have an argument over the use of her maiden name but Holly is called away.As the party continues, a large moving van from ""Pacific Courier"" makes its way to the building. Two men, Karl (Alexander Godunov) and Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), arrive in a car at the front entrance to the building. At the security desk they divert the security guards' attention away from the trucks. Karl guns down the guards while Theo commandeers the closed circuit security field and locks down all the elevators except for the service car. Terrorists led by the slick and well-mannered German anarchist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) emerge from the trucks and hold the partygoers as hostages in exchange for terrorist operatives in prison. In the confusion, McClane is able to disappear unnoticed into the building's maintenance areas but forgets to take his shoes along, leaving him barefoot. Takagi is taken from the party to the building's conference room and learns that Gruber is actually using the hostage situation as a cover to steal $640 million in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault. McClane, having made his way to the anteroom outside the conference room, is unable to stop Gruber from executing Takagi when he refuses to give him the vault's combination.McClane attempts to alert the local police by setting off a fire alarm -- his attempt fails when Hans has one of his men cancel the alarm and he is promptly discovered by Karl's brother, Tony. McClane kills Tony, taking his gun and radio, but finds the man's boots are too small. McClane places Tony's corpse in the only elevator left operational and hides on top of the car. Hans' men discover Tony in the elevator with an elf's hat on his head and a message written in Sharpie on his sweatshirt that reads ""NOW I HAVE A MACHINE GUN; HO-HO-HO"". While Hans angrily talks the situation over with his men, McClane writes down as many details about them as he can including some of their names and how many voices he hears. Karl is enraged and wants to leave immediately to find McClane but Hans stops him, saying that they need time for Theo to penetrate the outer locks of the vault and for the police to arrive.McClane makes it to the roof and tries to call the LAPD on Tony's walkie-talkie. Overheard by Hans and his men, he sends Karl to the roof to hunt down McClane. While McClane argues with the LAPD over his distress call -- they believe it to be a prank -- Karl and two of Hans' men attack, forcing McClane to retreat into the tower's ventilation system. When he emerges, he tries to get the attention of Sgt Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), sent by the dispatcher McClane had contacted before. When Marco and Heinrich find him in the conference room, McClane narrowly kills them both. Initially finding nothing amiss, Powell is ready to drive off but McClane, in a desperate move before his last hope for outside help leaves, gets his attention by throwing Marco's corpse out of the window and onto Powell's patrol vehicle. Another detachment of Gruber's men opens fire on Powell's car as he reverses out of the front circle and crashes, frantically calling for backup in his panicky state.While searching Heinrich's pockets and bag, McClane finds the henchman was carrying a significant quantity of C4 explosive and detonators. McClane taunts Gruber using Heinrich's walkie-talkie and tells him he killed a few of his men, giving Hans their names. Karl reports to Hans that McClane wasn't bluffing and that their adversary took Heinrich's bag, which presumably held all the detonators.With Powell now fully convinced that the emergency call was real, the situation rapidly escalates as the LAPD comes in force and surrounds the Nakatomi Building with a large SWAT force. However, Gruber is not too concerned: although the police responded somewhat sooner than he planned thanks to McClane's interference, the police are a necessary and unwitting part of Gruber's plan. As part of that plan, Gruber contacts the police with a list of difficult demands such as the release of various real terrorists he has no connection with and has only read about in the news to stall them. After he finishes with his bogus demands, Gruber gives Karl the order to hunt down McClane.Meanwhile, the SWAT team, led by Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason) arrives to storm the building. However, Theo monitors their movements on the security feed and alerts Gruber. Talking furiously to Powell, McClane attempts Robinson to stop the SWAT team from walking into a trap, but Powell cannot convince Robinson or the SWAT chief. The SWAT team is repelled, the SWAT armoured vehicle is disabled by a rocket launcher, and the police are out-gunned by the firepower of the terrorists and their strategic spots in the building. To stop two of Gruber's men from continuing to fire rockets upon the disabled SWAT armored car, McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and blows out the entire floor where the terrorists are planted, giving the cops a chance to retreat. By this time the news media are on the scene, led by sleazy reporter Richard Thornberg (William Atherton), and the FBI, led by Special Agent Johnson (Robert Davi) and his partner, Special Agent Johnson (Grand L. Bush) arrive to commandeer the situation. As they make their plans to shut down Hans and his crew, Thornberg discovers who McClane really is and that his wife lives in the area. He goes to Holly's house and, after threatening Holly's Latina housekeeper with deportation, interviews the McClane children on live TV.As the remainder of Gruber's men attempt to find McClane and the detonators, one of the hostages, Harry Ellis (Hart Bochner), believing he can negotiate with Hans, betrays McClane's identity, claiming they're old friends. Gruber suddenly breaks into a conversation between Powell and McClane, telling McClane he knows who he is, and demands that his adversary return the detonators or else he will kill Ellis. McClane refuses to surrender, pleading with Ellis to stop their dialog because Ellis doesn't understand the predicament he's put himself in. Gruber kills Ellis, to the horror of the police who have been listening in. McClane continues to keep moving through the building to learn more about Gruber's plans. McClane and Gruber accidentally meet but Gruber gains McClane's trust by passing himself off as an escaped hostage. McClane hands Gruber his pistol and tells him to stay close while they look for a way out of the building. Gruber then contacts his henchmen while pointing the pistol at McClane. When he pulls the trigger, it clicks on an empty chamber. McClane scoffs at Gruber's attempt to kill him just as Gruber's men arrive, opening fire immediately and pinning McClane down in a room full of computer terminals and glass-walled offices. Gruber suddenly gets an idea to shoot out all the glass in the room, making it treacherous for McClane to find a way out while he's barefoot. McClane flees anyway, dropping the bag containing the detonators. Gruber happily retrieves the bag however Karl is still furious that McClane got away.A few minutes later, while hiding in a nearby men's room, McClane talks to Powell while removing a large piece of glass embedded in his foot. McClane asks Powell about his past and Powell reveals that he hasn't had the nerve to draw his pistol in the line of duty in several years because he shot a young boy who pointed a toy pistol at him. McClane
wraps his foot in his tank top and tells Powell to contact Holly after the ordeal is over and let her know he loves her. Powell tells McClane to hang in and that his fellow officers even have a betting pool going on him. McClane sets out for the roof, curious as to why Gruber was snooping around there when he found him.The two overzealous FBI agents play their final card by shutting off the building's power while they plan a helicopter raid onto the roof. However, Gruber had planned for the FBI's predictability - disconnecting the power has shut down the final electromagnetic lock on the vault and given him access to the bonds. McClane, inspecting the top level, finds out Gruber has used the recovered detonators to rig the helipad on the building's roof with explosives. Gruber plans to demand helicopters to carry himself, his men and the hostages to a waiting plane at an airport. After the FBI informs Gruber that his demands have been met, Gruber's men force the hostages to the roof to be killed by the explosions, so they can escape in the confusion. McClane, after fighting off Karl and failing to warn the police of the Gruber's doublecross, is able to get the hostages back inside safely, but the FBI helicopter shoots at him, believing he's one of the terrorists. The helipad explodes, the helicopter is destroyed and both Johnsons are killed. McClane escapes again by jumping from the roof with a fire hose tied around his waist. He shoots out a window a few stories down and swings himself inside to safety.Gruber has discovered from Thornberg's newscast that Holly Gennaro is McClane's wife. He holds her hostage to prevent McClane from interfering in his getaway. McClane, down to his last two bullets, is able to lull Gruber into a trap; he surrenders with his pistol taped to his back. He draws quickly, killing the last remaining henchman, Eddie, and shoots Gruber through the chest, who falls backwards and out of the building through a window. Gruber manages to hang onto Holly's wristwatch, his weight dragging her out the window as well. McClane is able to unstrap the watch and lets Gruber fall to his death. Meanwhile, Theo is knocked unconscious by Argyle, while preparing their getaway vehicle, an ambulance, in the parking garage. McClane and Holly leave the building together, and meet Powell for the first time. Karl, posing as an injured survivor, bursts out behind McClane and Holly with his assault rifle, but Powell draws and shoots him before he can harm McClane and Holly. Thornberg attempts to interview them as they are leaving the scene, Holly punches him in the face for broadcasting his interview with their kids. McClane and Holly leave in Argyle's limo as the building is secured by the police."

Bent on becoming a successful millionaire, ambitious ex-military man Brian serves drinks at a New York City tavern and studies for his degree while waiting for his big break. Then, veteran bartender and cynical mentor Doug enters the picture, convinced that their chemistry and flamboyant tricks behind the bar will soon make the dynamic bartending duo famous and rich. But all good things must come to an end. As Brian tries to raise money in Jamaica to open his dream bar, a chance encounter with beautiful young waitress Jordan leads to a whirlwind romance and heartbreak.

Jordan, herself the daughter of wealthy parents back in New York City, leaves the Island overnight, after seeing Brian and the older woman together after closing - Will Jordan ever forgive Brian and will they get back together?—Joshua Jaworsky <jaworsky@gmail.com> The 1988 blockbuster classic, Cocktail.After some swift study, it appears nineteen-hundred and eighty-eight transpired as a monumental twelve-month period destined to be revered in the annals of movie creation history. Flawless gems such as: Big starring Tom Hanks who played the role of a kid who hates the success every adult wants, chooses to be a kid again - only to lose his edge and become a janitor later on; Rain Man starring Dustin Hoffman, already known for his adeptness at female role-play, took on the challenging task of a relatable, semi-cognitively-challenged millionaire; finally, let us not forget Eddie Murphy's masterful role in the flick, Coming to America, where he assumes the persona of an African prince who sets out on a quest to find a plebeian Yank to be his queen and eventually, indubitably withhold coitus-rights only after depleting the monarch's coffers. Other notable flicks released in this segment of time include Beetlejuice, Mystic Pizza, Willow, Child's Play, The Naked Gun, Bloodsport, Akira, The Land Before Time, Rambo III, and Hairspray!Originally, I was reluctant to review the movie in question and a quick analysis of the IMDb profile only furthered my suspicions. Overall viewer rating, at the time of this writing, was sitting at a homely five point seven stars out of a total of ten. The metascore was even more deficient with a measly tally of twelve out of one hundred. Not to be careless, I made sure to pore over several reviews before becoming a viewer myself. One of my favorites I shall transcribe hereafter:"" Cocktail makes beer commercials look deep, makes ""Top Gun"" look like ""Hamlet."" -written by Jay Carr of the Boston Globe [29 Jul 1988, p.21]Yes, friend, perhaps it is a rag. The copy writer for the Cocktail cover art would also seem to agree, as he decided to include the profound quote, ""Totally Entertaining!"" Let us get started then.The movie begins with a young, starry-eyed soldier named Brian Flanagan, played by everyone's favorite thetan (Tom Cruise), who has incredible ambitions of making millions, by means of mercantilism, in the Big Apple. It must be pointed out that for a film with a premise of alcohol consumption, naturally the main character would have Irish roots. After several rounds of unsurprising rejections, Brian finds himself at a crossroads; either get a job as a bartender or move back in with the parents. Naturally, Flanagan is unwilling to give-up on his dream of becoming an opulent entrepreneur, enrolls in the local business college while earning shelter and sustenance by working part-time as a rookie cockologist. Enter fellow spirit connoisseur and bullshitter, Doug Coughlin (represented by Bryan Brown), who takes the protagonist under his wing. Flanagan is taught all the tricks of the mixing trade: flips, twirls, under-hands, over-hands, in-betweens, short-pours, and long-pours; all designed to loosen men from their wallets and women from their chastities. It is not long before these two find themselves at the pinnacle of the bartending game in all of New York City, if not presumably the world.Doug and Brian are in Flanagan's apartment discussing how to get rich. They decide to become business partners and open a chain of ""local-style"" bars. The name for this franchise: ""Cocktails & Dreams."" Deliciously corny.It is around this time that I find my father fast asleep. Traditionally, he is more accustomed to a finely-tuned entertainment genre that typically focuses on exploding cars, unlimited ammunition firefights, Eastern Bloc nemeses and screaming damsels. 1988 happens to also be the year action flicks reached their golden age with the release of Die Hard starring Bruce Willis. My dad has a certain attachment to action heroes that have a predisposition to male pattern baldness, being one who is also afflicted. He loves and owns xXx starring the glabrous Vin Diesel, of which I can assure anyone reading this that it has little to do with the Eastern European sluts or Pontiac GTO cameos. Also, he has probably seen every Jason Statham movie ever made (42 at the time of this writing).Anyways, one fruitful night, Brian ends up getting seduced by a local playgirl, Coral (Gina Gershon), thus beginning a courtship based on nothing but heathenish desires. Apparently, the writer, Heywood Gould, expects the audience to believe that a gorgeous heiress is interested in a five-foot-seven-inch, hero bartender for nothing but fornication. I suppose that is all she really needs at this point, I mean, what is he going to do; buy her another purse? Doug bets Flanagan that his relationship with Coral is based on nothing and she will end up screwing with his head like a cold-hearted, aloof bitch. To win this bet, it is not long before the meister of mixology, Doug Coughlin, engages in an affair with Coral; Brian finds out. Doug claims it was for Flanagan's own good but naturally he gets walloped in the kisser, regardless. Hurt and betrayed, Brian plans to pursue his monetary ambitions in another part of the world. Feeling empowered by his business strategy of creating chain, dive bars in every mall and airport in the country, he sets off for Jamaica to earn himself roughly seventy-thousand fiat United States dollars, the sum needed for his very first one.Presumably months (years?) later, the viewer finds Brian slaving away at some seaside speakeasy serving patrons of the local hotel. It is business as usual until the very voluptuous and fetching Jordan Mooney, depicted by Elisabeth Shue, arrives barside to steal his attention. I am assuming at this point Brian was still very butthurt over the whole Coral thing and had yet to bed a nice Jamaican girl. Of course, on an island of chocolate pudding the female love interest would have to be of Celtic origins. I digress; cue montage of Brian and Jordan participating in cliché date activities like riding horseback, enjoying the local fauna, hanging out in town where stereotypical, dreadlocks dude is dancing in the street. After a mandatory conversation to see if Brian is ambitious enough for Jordan's tastes, over cocktails, the two find themselves raptured in each other's embrace. We are talking about 1988, R-rated skinny-dipping, where side-boob makes an appearance (played by Elisabeth Shue's left breast). Things start to get weird when Jordan brings up the topic of our bartender siring her offspring. Brian does not seem to mind too much; at least he knows he is doing something right and he might really like this one, this time. Sigh, if only she was rich.It is not long before Mister Flanagan finds his way to trouble, however. The loathsome shyster, and long-time amigo, Doug Coughlin makes his grand return; systematically. Coughlin is rich now; sucking from the affluent teat of his new wife, both literally and figuratively, and he has come to gloat to Brian. How can this be; how can that rat bastard have a gorgeous, young, millionairess wife? Thus far, Flanagan has been very preoccupied with wealth and status. Knowing this, Doug presents a dare, a bet, claiming that Brian is without the social graces & silver tongue to woo a rich, soon-to-be cougar by the name of Bonnie (Lisa Banes). Young and rash, Brian takes Doug up on the bet and sure shows him. Next thing I know, Bonnie is having the time of her life and is requesting more! Unfortunately, Jordan saw both Brian and Bonnie walking away together; clearly sloshed and primed for acts of intercourse. Mooney is a sweet girl and feels taken advantage of by Flanagan who clearly must be some sort of philanderer. The next day, Brian feeling disgusted with himself, sets off to find Jordan only to hear from her friend that she had already taken the red-eye back to New York City. Disappointment is only temporary as he decides to benefit from Bonnie's station in life. This could be his ticket to a high-salaried marketing career and besides, its not like she is post-menopausal, yet.New York, New York, here we are again. Brian assumes the position of Bonnie's apartment-bound gigolo; forever lured by the promise of a sales position at her company. One evening, Bonnie takes her pet to a local art gallery where her aspiring sculptor acquaintance is showing off his latest work. Flannagan is rather flustered at this point. First she will not follow through on the job, then she does not even bother to introduce him to her friends and makes him hold all her refuse. He is determined to vacate and implores that she comply. Bonnie is having a grand time talking to the artist and does not want to exit. Brian and the sculptor get into, first, an argument and then a pugilist bout. During said fisticuffs, Brian kicks the artist into a sculpture, knocking both the creator and creation to the ground. Overcome with grief, the artist loses all drive to fight as this particular statue was meant for posterity.My dad wakes up, possibly drawn to consciousness by the sounds of brawling craftsman; one of boulder, alloy and the other of ethanol, glass & garnish.With Bonnie and Brian's ""relationship"" finally brought to a close, Flanagan sets out to find Jordan and apologize. He finds her working at her diner job where she promptly gives him both of the day's specials; one on his head and another on his lap. Later on, Flanagan finagles his way into Jordan's apartment where he sees her impressive paintings. She reveals to him that she is pregnant, however, Mooney makes it clear she will have nothing to do with him, despite Brian's persistence. A few days later, Brian goes to confront Jordan but finds she is not at her apartment, but rather, her parents' Park Avenue flat. She is a princess after all! Naturally, Jordan's father does not like Flanagan or the situation. He attempts to pay him off but Brian refuses the ten thousand, which is an amount he could desperately use to get his bar started.Brian leaves to go grovel for a job promised to him by his old pal, Doug Coughlin. Brian sneaks in past the security of Doug's wife's club. The two cockologists reunite and decide to have a drink someplace private. Doug confides in Brian that he lost most of his wife's money by poorly investing in commodities. Having too much to drink, Coughlin falls asleep (or at least pretends to) as his wife asks to go home. Being a good friend, Brian takes her home and almost bangs her out. He leaves, resisting the horizontal-hokey-pokey and arrives where he left Doug, only to see that he has committed suicide with a very expensive, broken bottle of brandy (or something). After the funeral, Brian reads a letter left for him from Coughlin. Doug says he committed suicide because he was just a bullshitter. Brian does not want to be a piece of fecal matter anymore and discontinues emulating the deceased Doug.Flannagan goes back to Jordan's parents' Park Avenue apartment and eventually fights off both the doorman and butler. Jordan's father and Brian exchange some nasty words. After a confession of love, Jordan leaves with Brian and the father cuts them off from his vault of gold bars, jewel encrusted rings, old paintings, et cetera.After getting some seed money from his father, Brian finally opens his first bar and names it, ""Flanagan's Cocktails & Dreams."" Brian and Jordan have their wedding reception there; she reveals she is pregnant with twins; Flanagan gives everyone free drinks to celebrate; they probably get divorced in five to ten years; Jordan takes ownership of fifty percent of the dive bars in subsequent annulment proceedings.
In conclusion, Cocktail is an iteration of an age old scenario; a coming of age story and a tale of overcoming greed and using one's pride the honorable way. Additionally, it is possible to not appreciate the good things, when you have them, and easy to not know they were good until they are gone. Real wealth is not what you have but whom you share it with. In the movie, Brian Flanagan gets a second chance but it is a lesson to all viewers that the same opportunity rarely comes around twice.When he pours, he reigns."

Their efforts attract Beetlejuice, a rambunctious spirit whose ""help"" quickly becomes dangerous for the Maitlands and innocent Lydia.—Jwelch5742 Following a freak accident, the blissful Maitlands now rest in peace. But nothing lasts forever--while stuck in limbo, a mysterious force sends the ghostly pair back to the realm of the living. However, fate plays cruel tricks on mortals--now, insufferable New York yuppies Charles and Delia Deetz occupy the Maitlands' lovingly decorated New England home. Unfortunately, the Maitlands' haunting skills are pathetic, and sharing their beloved house with the obnoxious invaders is out of the question. Under those grave circumstances, only Beetlejuice--a manic, rotten-toothed veteran exorcist--can rid the place of unwanted guests. But what happens if the cure is worse than the disease?—Nick Riganas This is the story of Adam and Barbara who live in a beautiful house in New England.

Their only relief is the Gothic daughter of the family. Their attempts at scaring the family out of the house are ignored or laughed at. Finally they fall to the temptation to use the people-exorciser Beetlejuice. When they find his tactics too dangerous, they attempt to contain him and save the family they were trying to boot.—FMJ_Joker In a sleepy little town in New England, we meet Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) Maitland, a couple who have chosen to take a vacation by staying at home. However, the realtor who sold them the house, Jane (Annie McEnroe), tries to entice them to sell the house, since it seems too big for just a couple. The Maitlands reject her pleas and head to town. On the way home they swerve to avoid a dog, which sends them into a river where they drown.Unaware that they are dead, the Maitlands return to the house, unsure how they got back so quickly. Adam decides to go back outside to 'retrace their steps,' but finds himself on a strange desert planet inhabited by striped sandworms. When he returns to the house, Barbara says he was gone for two hours and shows him a book that she found on a table, Handbook for the Recently Deceased.Time passes relatively quickly, and soon, the Maitlands' house is sold again (under Jane's watchful eye) to the Deetzes, a New York family composed of Charles (Jeffrey Jones), Delia (Catherine O'Hara), and their daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). While Charles wishes for a quiet respite from the hustle and bustle of New York, Delia can't stand the simple life, and hires a decorator named Otho (Glenn Shadix) to make the house more 'livable' and more to her tastes.Adam and Barbara try to scare the Deetzes, but all their efforts are for naught, as it seems that the living can't see the dead. They take refuge in the attic, where Adam locks the door. However, Lydia finds a skeleton key and tries to open the door. As Adam and Barbara foil her attempts, a TV in the attic comes to life, advertising the services of someone named Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), who claims to be able to scare the living.Consulting the handbook, Adam creates a door that takes him and Barbara to a waiting room in the afterlife, filled with others who have met rather gruesome fates. They are shown to a special room, which reveals their home after it has been redecorated by Delia and Otho. It is here that they are introduced to their case worker Juno (Sylvia Sidney), who chastises them for their haunting methods and cautions them not to take the advice of the person they saw on the television.Returning to the house, Adam and Barbara dress up in sheets to try and scare Charles and Delia, but their attempt fails again. Annoyed with the spooky noises, Lydia finds them, and the two are amazed when they remove the bedsheets and realize she can see them! Lydia reveals that she found their handbook, and found a passage that explains how 'live people ignore the strange and unusual,' something she considered herself to be.The Maitlands enlist Lydia to help get the Deetzes out of their house, but no one believes her. Not sure what to do, Barbara notices something in the model of the town in the attic: a glowing light around a small grave that appears to belong to Beetlejuice. She says his name three times, and she and Adam are whisked into the model, where they unearth Beetlejuice's body. Once they've done so they regret it, as Beetlejuice is a rather crazy, uncouth and insane ghoul. Turned off by his personality, they resolve to scare the Deetzes themselves.At a dinner party Delia throws to show her sculptures and other art pieces, the entire group ends up singing 'The Banana Boat Song,' and the shrimp dish in front of them turns into grasping hands. The Maitlands think they've finally succeeded, only to find that their antics have actually amused the Deetzes. The Deetzes send Lydia to bring them down, and when they refuse, everyone clambers to the attic, demanding that the Maitlands show themselves. They find no one there, but Charles is entranced by the miniature of the town, and Otho finds and takes the handbook.Leaving the attic, Charles feels that there is a lucrative business venture just waiting to happen. However, his cheerfulness turns to horror as Beetlejuice transforms into a large snake, freaking out the family by knocking Otho down the stairs and dropping Charles to the floor below. Barbara manages to call the snake off by uttering Beetlejuice's name three times. Lydia is distraught, thinking that the snake was the Maitlands intending to do more than just scare them.The Maitlands are brought before Juno again, who takes them to task for breaking a number of rules: having photos taken of themselves, letting Beetlejuice out, and letting Otho get hold of the handbook. Juno encourages the Maitlands to work harder to scare the Deetzes, and Barbara and Adam contort their features into grotesque forms. However, Barbara has some apprehensions, as she likes Lydia.Meanwhile, Lydia grows so upset that she writes a suicide letter. Going to the attic to say goodbye to the Maitlands, she encounters Beetlejuice in the model. Beetlejuice tries to convince her that he can help her find the Maitlands if she says his name three times. Lydia is almost tricked into saying this, until she realizes that Beetlejuice was the snake, and doubts if he really can help her find the Maitlands. Just then, Adam and Barbara appear, and Lydia explains what was about to happen. Lydia, feeling distraught to be living, tells them of her wish to be dead. Barbara talks her out of these thoughts, and tells her that they've decided to not scare the family, and allow them to stay.Just then, Otho and Charles appear in the attic; Lydia and the Maitlands hide. Otho and Charles carry Adam's model of the town downstairs, where they give Charles' business associate Maxie Deen (Robert Goulet) an overview of Charles' plan to turn the town into a paranormal-themed attraction. Charles also requests that Lydia produce the Maitlands for their guests, but when she refuses, Otho explains that he has a way.Using the handbook and the Maitlands' wedding clothes, Otho performs a seance that forces the couple to appear before them. However, this causes the Maitlands to deteriorate, their forms reverting to their decaying corpses.Frantic, Lydia rushes to the model and sees Beetlejuice in the graveyard. She begs him to help her. Beetlejuice agrees on the condition that Lydia marries him. She agrees to this, and the Maitlands are saved. However, Beetlejuice then holds Lydia to her word, and holds Charles and Delia hostage as 'witnesses,' as Otho escapes.Both Adam and Barbara struggle to stop Beetlejuice, who sends Adam into the model and Barbara to the sandworm planet. Through a joint effort, they do away with Beetlejuice and save Lydia.In the aftermath, the Maitlands and the Deetzes co-occupy the house, and Lydia is much more cheerful in her new environment."

She teams up with Jack Trainer to close the deal before Katherine's return and the two slowly fall in love little knowing that Jack is Katherine's boyfriend...—Lee Horton <Leeh@tcp.co.uk> Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is a 30-year-old secretary at Petty Marsh, a Manhattan financial conglomerate. An ambitious hard worker, Tess's goal is to move out of the secretarial pool and into an executive position, but she faces numerous obstacles. Because her business degree was not acquired at a prestigious school, she cannot gain entry to her firm's training program for recent college graduates. She also attends speech classes to sophisticate her speaking voice. She confides in her best friend and co-worker Cynthia (Joan Cusack) on their daily ferry commute.Tess's supervisor, David Lutz (Oliver Platt), is aware that Tess is seeking to advance her career, and provides her with the phone number of his colleague Bob Speck (Kevin Spacey). Tess is disgusted to find that Speck is a lascivious and debauched cokehead who promptly tries to seduce her in his limousine, forcing her to flee the car. Furious with Lutz, Tess returns to the office and humiliates him by writing an insulting message to him on the office stock-ticker.Following this incident, Tess is reassigned to a new financial division for Petty Marsh. She becomes the secretary for the company's new mergers executive, Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). Tess is mildly nervous but ultimately pleased to be working for a woman for the first time, and is surprised to learn that Katharine is slightly younger than her as well. Katharine welcomes Tess with apparent warmth, promising a supportive, communicative relationship, and encouraging her to come forward with any ideas.Tess happily describes her new boss to her live-in boyfriend, Mick (Alec Baldwin), and expresses enthusiasm about finally having a potential mentor to help develop her career. Mick remains largely uninterested in Tess's work ambitions, but Tess is not discouraged. She continues to observe Katharine's style and mannerisms, admiring her poise and fearless navigation of the male-dominated business community.Petty Marsh acquires a new client, Trask Industries, which has expressed interest in investing in television to acquire a media foothold. Intrigued, Tess does some research and concludes that Trask would benefit more from an initial investment in radio, due to reduced competition. She presents this idea to Katharine, who receives it with an indulgent smile and promises to pass it along. Soon afterward, she informs Tess that the notion was shot down, as Trask is dead-set on investing in TV.Katharine is preparing for a skiing vacation in Europe, and reveals to Tess that she expects her boyfriend Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), a fellow executive, to propose marriage during the trip. In the meantime, Katharine gives Tess an inspiring pep talk, encouraging her not to wait for what she wants to fall into her lap, but to make it happen herself.Jack Trainer makes a last-minute excuse to Katharine and backs out of the skiing trip, but Katharine senses no lost interest on his part. While enjoying the vacation on her own, she breaks her leg on the slopes and calls Tess from the hospital with a flurry of instructions. Tess agrees to inform other executives that Katharine will be out of commission for a few weeks, to keep up with work communication, and to check up on Katharine's Manhattan townhouse. Tess is fascinated with Katharine's luxurious lifestyle, and explores Katharine's impressive closets, gadgets, and workout equipment. Having discovered a handheld tape recorder containing Katharine's personal voice memos, Tess learns that Katharine had, in fact, seen Tess's suggestion about Trask as valuable, and that it had clearly not been dismissed as Katharine had claimed. Katharine's home computer reveals a message to Jack Trainer, passing off Tess's idea as her own and suggesting they move forward with it. Tess is angry and hurt by the betrayal, and returns to her apartment, where she discovers Mick in bed with Doreen DiMucci (Elizabeth Whitcraft), a mutual friend. Disgusted, and ignoring Mick's contrived apologies, Tess storms out.With no other options, Tess takes up temporary residence at Katharine's house, informing only Cynthia of this information. Catalyzed by the pain of both betrayals, and taking to heart Katharine's ironic advice of ""making it happen"" for herself, Tess resolves to jump-start her career while she has Katharine's advantages at her disposal. Using Katharine's name, she sets up a meeting with executives from Dewey Stone and Company, a radio organization where Jack Trainer is employed, to discuss a possible merger deal with Trask. Tess finds Katharine's invitation to a party hosted by Dewey Stone, and plans to attend the party herself in order to introduce herself to Jack the night before the meeting. She has Cynthia give her a more sophisticated hairstyle, but panics when she realizes the dress she borrowed from Katharine's wardrobe is worth six thousand dollars. Cynthia obtains a bottle of Valium from Katharine's medicine cabinet, and Tess accepts one to calm her nerves.Tess arrives at the party, and realizes she has no idea what Jack Trainer looks like, or how to find him. Sitting at the bar to collect her thoughts, Jack Trainer himself notices her and invites her to share in a few rounds of tequila. She asks if he can point her toward Jack Trainer, but he slyly conceals his identity, and the two flirt and drink until Tess feels the combination of alcohol and Valium taking effect. She prepares to leave, asking Jack to bring her coat out to her while she hails a cab. When Jack arrives outside with her coat, he finds Tess nearly unconscious in the back of a taxi, unable to give directions to the driver. Jack takes her to his apartment, carries her upstairs, carefully removes her expensive dress, puts her to bed, and falls asleep himself.Tess wakes up in her underwear, with a stranger asleep beside her. Mortified, and assuming the encounter had turned sexual while she was intoxicated, she quickly dresses and slips out of the apartment before Jack awakens. Later that day, Tess is shocked when she attends the Dewey Stone meeting and finds herself face to face with the stranger from the previous night. They both keep their composure, and Tess introduces herself as a Petty Marsh executive rather than a secretary. Jack and his colleagues are intrigued by Tess's proposal, and agree to present it within their company and let her know if it can proceed.Tess returns to Katharine's office, bemoaning to Cynthia that she had made a fool of herself the previous night. Cynthia expresses concerns about the stressful toll Tess is enduring from her double life. To their great surprise, Jack arrives on the floor, asking to see Tess. Cynthia, posing as Tess's secretary, shows Jack in, and leaves them to talk in private. Tess demands to know what happened after the party, and Jack assures her that nothing sexual occurred, and that Dewey Stone is game to move forward with the Trask deal. He invites her to dinner to celebrate the merger, but Tess, despite a developing mutual attraction, declines.With her deal underway, Tess continues assuming the persona of an executive with Jack and his colleagues while assuring Katharine over the phone that everything is running as normal. Tess embraces her new role in the business world, but is faced with seeing Mick again when they both attend Cynthia's engagement party. They catch up, with Mick congratulating her on her professional success, but when Mick is pressured by other party goers (who are unaware of his infidelity) to propose to Tess on the spot, Tess coyly gives a non-committal answer. Mick angrily confronts her afterward, accusing her of embarrassing him and of having skewed priorities. Realizing that Mick had never genuinely supported her or valued her goals, Tess finally lets their relationship end for good.Tess and Jack plan to speak with Trask's CEO, Oren Trask (Philip Bosco), to pitch their merger to him directly. They manage to crash his daughter's wedding reception, and secure an appointment to discuss it further. The meeting goes well, and Tess and Jack, elated by their success, give into their attraction at last. After a night together, Jack receives a phone call from Katharine while Tess is in bed beside him. He admits to Tess that he had been seeing a woman for some time, but the relationship had deteriorated for him, and he has been struggling to find the right time to end it. Tess does not reveal her connection with Katharine, nor that she is merely a secretary.Katharine calls Tess with the news that she is finally being released from the hospital, and will be returning to Manhattan. Tess scrambles to tidy Katharine's house, and to prepare for the finalization of the Trask deal, which is scheduled for the same day that Katharine comes home. Tess manages to keep up with everything, and rushes to the roof of the Petty Marsh building where Katharine arrives by helicopter. She escorts Katharine home, and begins to worry about arriving to her meeting on time, as Katharine is attempting to saddle her with numerous errands and tasks.Katharine has arranged for Jack to visit her at home that afternoon, still convinced that he will propose to her. She has Tess help her change into lingerie, completely unaware that Tess and Jack are now in a relationship. While Tess runs out to pick up a prescription for Katharine, Jack arrives at the house, making rushed and awkward conversation with Katharine, who remains oblivious to his discomfort. Still too nervous to end the relationship outright, Jack joins her in a glass of champagne and quickly departs after she attempts to seduce him. Tess returns soon afterward, finding a disappointed Katharine moping in bed. Tess gives Katharine her prescription and hurries off to her meeting, but in her haste leaves her appointment book behind. Katharine reads through it, discovers that Tess has been meeting with Jack for both business and pleasure, and furiously pursues Tess to the Trask office.Tess meets Jack at the Trask boardroom, and the meeting begins. Oren Trask is happy with the merger, but before the deal is finalized, Katharine bursts through the door on crutches and exposes Tess as a mere secretary. Tess does not deny this, but attempts to defend herself against Katharine's accusations that Tess had stolen the idea for the merger. Realizing the other executives are being taken in by Katharine's manipulations, Tess tearfully gives up and excuses herself from the boardroom. Jack is shocked and upset, but Katharine wastes no time in continuing the deal herself.Soon afterward Tess attends Cynthia's wedding as the Maid of Honor. She again speaks to Mick, who is now openly in a relationship with Doreen. They wish each other well, and part amicably. With her best friend away on a honeymoon, her boss furious with her, and her budding relationship with Jack abruptly halted, Tess returns alone to Petty Marsh to clean out her desk, bidding farewell to her fellow secretaries. As Tess makes what she assumes is her last walk through the lobby, she encounters Jack, Katharine, Oren Trask, and several executives on their way to continue the deal. Tess confronts Katharine, no longer holding back her fury, and refuses to be cowed by Katharine's lies and dishonesty. Katharine presents herself as a victim of Tess's manipulation, while Tess assures Jack that, while she had lied about her job title, everything about their romance had been genuine. Oren Trask is still not convinced of Tess's story, but Jack asserts that Tess put the deal together, and that she should be heading the meeting. The group heads to Katharine's floor, with Jack, Tess, and Trask in a separate elevator. On the ride up, Tess explains the origins of her initial idea about the merger, and outlines the potential obstacles she had prepared for, as well as a number of thoughtful details that finally prove to Trask that Tess has true talent for business, and that the merger was indeed her brainchild. Approaching Katharine in front of her office, Trask asks her to explain the inspiration behind the deal she had allegedly constructed. Katharine is unable to provide a satisfactory answer, and though she attempts to stall, Trask takes great delight in dismissing her on the spot. After Katharine angrily stalks off, Trask compliments Tess on her gumption, and offers her an entry-level job at Trask Industries, which she happily accepts.By the time her new job starts, Tess is living with Jack. He packs her a lunch for her first day, and sends her off with pride and encouragement.
Tess arrives at work, and sits at the secretary's desk outside the appointed office. The woman in the office, who had been using the telephone, introduces herself as Alice Baxter (Amy Aquino), and apologizes for using the office phone. Tess is confused until Alice clarifies that the office belongs to Tess, and that she, Alice, is her secretary.

In London, Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson), his seductive American girlfriend Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis), and their associate Ken Pile (Sir Michael Palin) are planning their latest crime: a diamond heist that should net them 13 million pounds sterling. They plan to leave the country with the goods after the heist. On Wanda's recommendation, they enlist the help of her weapons-expert brother Otto West (Kevin Kline) for this heist. Actually, Otto isn't Wanda's brother, but her latest lover, a dimwit who gets off on his own body odor and believes he's an intellectual because he reads Nietzsche and does not tolerate being called stupid by anyone. Wanda has one weakness in men which is how Otto was able to get her to be his lover: speaking Italian in seduction. Wanda and Otto plan to double-cross Georges by having him arrested for the heist while they abscond with the jewels. Wanda further plans to triple-cross Otto by eliminating him from the picture after she has the jewels. They are able to get Georges arrested with him not knowing who tipped the off the police, and implicated by elderly eyewitness Eileen Coady (Patricia Hayes). With Georges in jail, Wanda and Otto discover that he has protected his investment by moving the jewels from their agreed location to a hidden one, telling nobody where they are but offering Ken a slight hint. Georges gives Ken, an animal lover with an extreme stutter, the task of killing Mrs. Coady before she is able to testify against him, as she is the Crown's primary witness. Meanwhile, Wanda has her own plan to reach her end goal: seduce George's defense lawyer Archie Leach (John Cleese) and find out Georges' secrets about the heist, including the location of the jewels. Archie may be easy prey for Wanda's seduction, as his wife Wendy (Maria Aitken) is a self-absorbed woman who pays him little attention. Otto might throw a wrench into Wanda's plans if he finds out what she's doing.—Huggo British gangster Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and his hapless aide Ken Pile (Sir Michael Palin) draft a pair of arrogant Americans, grifter Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and weapons expert Otto West (Kevin Kline), for a massive diamond heist. When the job goes badly, Wanda attempts to seduce Georges' stuffy lawyer Archie Leach (John Cleese) to find out where Georges hid the diamonds. Meanwhile, Ken repeatedly attempts to kill an elderly woman who witnessed the robbery.—Jwelch5742 To lend a hand in a bold diamond heist, British criminal mastermind Georges Thomason and his animal-loving right-hand man Ken Pile enlist the help of two siblings: the statuesque Wanda Gershwitz and her loose-cannonFriedrich Nietzsche-quoting brother Otto West. However, after they pull off the robbery in broad daylight, greed takes over, and an anonymous call to the police sends behind bars Georges, the only man who knows the location of the hidden loot. Now Wanda must put her stunning looks to good use and seduce Thomason's unsuspecting barrister Archie Leach in high hopes of finding the jewels. But the seemingly-foolproof plan is already falling to pieces. Is there no honour among thieves anymore?—Nick Riganas Sexy American diamond lover Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her boyfriend Otto West (Kevin Kline) are in England to plot with Georges Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and Ken Pile (Sir Michael Palin) the robbery of a diamond collection. Wanda and Otto want the stolen diamonds for themselves, and inform the police about Georges, not knowing that he has already moved the diamonds to another secret place. Wanda thinks the best way to find out is by getting close to Georges' lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese).—Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> George Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and his right-hand man, Ken Pile (Michael Palin), a beleaguered animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist and bring in two Americans to help: an alluring con artist, Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a ""weapons man"", Otto West (Kevin Kline). Wanda and Otto are lovers pretending to be siblings so that Wanda can work her charms on George and Ken. Wanda and Otto plan to betray Ken and George after the heist, and vice-versa. Wanda, it later transpires, is also planning to betray Otto.After the robbery, Wanda and Otto betray George to the police, intending to take all the loot for themselves, but discover that George and Ken have moved the loot to a new location. Wanda decides to seduce George's unhappily married lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese) to find out where it is. Meanwhile, Ken is charged by George to silence a key witness, and Otto exerts his energies in fits of jealousy over Wanda and Archie and of impatience with Ken and Britain in general. Otto's interference, and other incidences of bad luck, lead Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong.There is subsequent confusion and slapstick. For example, in various attempts to kill the witness, the animal-loving Ken accidentally instead kills her three Yorkshire Terriers one by one. The witness eventually suffers a fatal heart attack when her third Terrier is killed. The title is derived from the name of Ken's favorite tropical fish, which Otto eats alive, to Ken's distress, during the farcical torture scene.Archie and Wanda gradually fall in love and the movie ends with those two leaving the country with the jewels. Ken finally has his revenge on Otto by running him over with a steamroller (which he somehow survives). Title cards at the end of the movie reveal their futures: ""Archie and Wanda were married in Rio, had seventeen children, and founded a leper colony. Ken became Master of Ceremonies at the London Sea World. Otto emigrated to South Africa and became Minister for Justice.=================================At the London flat of Ken an animal lover with a large tank of tropical fish (the large angelfish is named ""Wanda"", after his flatmate George's sexy American girlfriend) and a nasty stutter, a meeting takes place with himself, the attractive Wanda, her lover George and her ""brother"" Otto. They plan to rob the store of a prominent London jeweler and steal a cache of diamonds. Otto, a belligerent and boisterous former CIA operative, will provide the weapons and plot the strategy to rob the business with no deaths involved, at the behest of George, who has brought the idea for the caper to the group.The robbery goes off without a hitch and as the team makes their getaway, they nearly run over an elderly woman out walking her dogs. She sees George without his ski mask on. The team splits up, George, Wanda and Otto place the diamonds in a small safe housed in a garage and continue with their plan to lay low for a few days before flying out of the country. Just after Wanda and Otto leave the garage, George returns, retrieves the loot and drives off with it.Back at Otto's flat, Wanda (who reveals that Otto is not her brother but her 2nd lover) fends off Otto's attempts at seducing her long enough to have Otto phone the police and give them George's name.George is arrested at his own flat and implicated with the crime; he has particles of glass on the leg of his trousers from the jeweler's. George is allowed to meet with Ken and gives him a small key, which Ken hides in the tiny treasure chest of his aquarium -- Wanda sees Ken hiding the key and later takes it, hiding it in her locket. When she later checks with a locksmith about the key, he is unable to identify it other than it being to a safe deposit box. When Wanda and Otto meet with George, he is immediately suspicious of Otto despite Otto's attempts to be concerned about George. At a police lineup, the woman that George nearly killed with his car points him out as the man who nearly killed her dogs. At the grand jury hearing, George gives Ken a small nod, identifying the old lady.Wanda sees that George is being represented by a barrister named Archie Leach. Wanda begins to play up to him, trying to find out more information about George's case. Archie initially tells her he is not allowed to speak to her since she's been subpoenaed as a character witness for George. Archie, himself in a loveless marriage, later acquiesces, saying that it's permitted for him to talk to Wanda as long as they don't discuss the case itself. The two meet clandestinely several times -- at Archie's house, while his wife and daughter are out for the evening, Wanda loses her locket with the key inside. Archie's wife, having returned with their daughter after they had a tire blow out, believes the locket is a gift to her from Archie. Wanda demands the locket be returned.Wanda is also faced with Otto's extreme jealousy with regards to Wanda's attempts to seduce Archie. Several times Otto threatens Archie with bodily harm, even dangling him out a window. Wanda is furious, explaining to Otto that his jealous behavior may get them in trouble & they still won't be able to find out where George hid the diamonds. She demands Otto apologize to Archie.Archie's attempts to get the locket back from his wife mostly fail. One day he goes to his own house and stages a robbery. While he loots a few small objects from his wife's jewelry collection (and breaks a small ceramic figurine) Otto, who'd arrived at Archie's house to apologize, finds him and beats him, believing he's helping out Archie by catching a random burglar. When he discovers that he's beaten Archie himself, he leaves him tied up and flees. Archie, just as his wife arrives home and becomes distraught at the minor destruction her husband had staged, hides Wanda's locket in his mouth until his hands are freed and he can spit it out and hide it in his pocket. He rushes off to a flat belonging to a friend and meets Wanda, giving her the locket. The two decide to have sex -- Archie inadvertently finds that Wanda can be easily seduced when he speaks any foreign language, until they're interrupted by a family that had rented the flat. Archie is caught naked and embarrassed. He calls Wanda and says he's going to end their tryst. Right after he does so and returns home, he's intercepted by Otto, who apologizes to him and grants him permission to continue his affair with Wanda. Unknown to Archie, Wendy is listening from an open window above.Ken, charged by George with killing the elderly woman with the dogs, tries to make her death look accidental. He only succeeds in killing her dogs one by one until, when he accidentally kills the last dog, the woman dies of a heart attack on the street. Ken reports to George, who gives Ken the go-ahead to retrieve the loot & pack for their escape destination: Rio de Janeiro, saying they'll take both Wanda and Otto & eliminate Otto later. At Ken's flat, Otto figures out that Ken knows where the loot is & tortures him: he ties Ken up and eats all the fish in his aquarium one at a time, including the beloved angelfish Wanda until Ken confesses that the safety deposit box is in a hotel near Heathrow Airport. However, the key is not in the aquarium and Otto calls Wanda, who tells him she'll give him the key and the loot if they flee to Rio together after she testifies on George's behalf.In court, Wanda takes the stand and Archie questions her about her relationship with George. She portrays him as an honest man until she drops a few details that clue the court into George's involvement in the crime, stating that George had left their flat armed with a shotgun right before the crime. Archie, surprised by Wanda's turn, calls her by her first name and calls her ""Darling"". Wendy, observing in the mezzanine, is silently infuriated.George becomes enraged at Wanda's comments and attacks her, causing general melee in the room while the guards try to subdue him. Archie receives a knock on the head from George and is left alone in the courtroom. When Wendy approaches him, she slaps him and tells him she's filing for divorce. Archie then takes a private meeting with George, assuring him that he'd arranged to lead Wanda on the witness stand to get George exonerated. He strikes a deal with George to receive a lesser sentence and convinces George to reveal the location of the diamonds: George tells Archie he'll find Ken back at his flat, who knows where they are.Outside the court building, Archie finds Wanda trying to sneak off and takes her in his car to George's flat. Archie goes in alone to find Ken and possibly face off against Otto. He finds Ken tied up and hears a car collision outside: Otto, having found Wanda alone, takes off with her after the minor fender-bender to the airport. Archie tries to get the nervously stuttering Ken to tell him where the diamonds are hidden. He finally gets Ken to write down the name of the hotel, the Cathcart Towers, and they take off for the airport.At the Cathcart, Wanda and Otto retrieve the diamonds and get their tickets to Rio. As they walk to the gate, Wanda clubs Otto and locks him in a small closet. Archie finds Otto lagging behind Wanda after she'd clubbed him and is able to grab Otto's Walther PPK but tricks Archie into dropping it and grabs it himself. Having a few minutes before he has to leave with Wanda, Otto takes great delight in humiliating Archie by making him stand in a barrel of used oil outside the terminal while insulting him and his British heritage. Archie spots Ken driving toward them on a steamroller. Archie distracts Otto by ridiculing America's loss to North Vietnam. When he warns Otto of Ken. Laughing and thinking that Ken could never catch up to him, much less kill him, Otto steps into a recent batch of wet concrete and is stuck. Frantically apologizing to the vengeance-bent Ken for eating his fish, he's run under the steamroller. Ken, overjoyed at gaining revenge on his tormentor, suddenly loses his stutter and is arrested.Archie is able to make it to Wanda's plane and the two reconcile. As they take off, Otto, still alive, suddenly appears at their window but is blown off. Closing titles tell us that Archie and Wanda married, had children & founded a leper colony. Ken became master of ceremonies at London Sea World. Otto left for South Africa and became a minister of justice."
Scrooged,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A selfish, cynical television executive is haunted by three spirits bearing lessons on Christmas Eve. Francis Xavier Cross is a cynical, mean spirited television executive, he treats his loyal assistant with contempt. He just sacked a member of staff on Christmas Eve for simply disagreeing with him, and he's alienated himself from his brother who still insists on inviting Frank to Christmas dinner despite him refusing to go every year. However, Frank is forced to learn the true meaning of Christmas when he's visited by three ghosts.—Iantjambo Intent on milkingCharles Dickens'A Christmas Carol (1951)for every drop of profit and personal success, the miserly curmudgeon and IBC's obnoxious president, Frank Cross, plans his own live adaptation on Christmas Eve. Alone and loveless, the tyrannical executive has burned all bridges with everyone, and, especially, his family; however, one little wake-up call from an unexpected ally and a stealthy nocturnal visitation of the three ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future is bound to show him the evil of his ways. But, is Scrooge capable of change?—Nick Riganas Frank Cross (Murray) is a wildly successful television executive whose cold ambition and curmudgeonly nature has driven away the love of his life. But after firing staff member Eliot Loudermilk (Goldthwait) on Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by a series of ghosts who give him a chance to re-evaluate his actions and right the wrongs of his past. Frank Cross runs a U.S. television station which is planning a live adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Frank's childhood wasn't a particularly pleasant one, and so he doesn't really appreciate the Christmas spirit. With the help of the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future, Frank realizes he must change.—Rob Hartill Francis ""Frank"" Xavier Cross is a conceited, cynical television programming executive who has the position of president for television network IBC. Frank has found great success and wealth but only by becoming cold-hearted and arrogant. In the opening scenes, he is seen working out in a room with a border that reads ""Cross: (n) A thing they nail people to.""His ruthless concentration on his career has alienated him from his family, having only an ""at arm's length"" relationship with his brother James, who is now his only living blood relative. Frank overworks his assistant Grace Cooley, forcing her to constantly break plans with her family and neglect her mute son Calvin. When a disturbing TV commercial that Frank personally produced is criticized by timid staff member Eliot Loudermilk, Frank responds by firing him on Christmas Eve. Frank's boss Preston Rhinelander comes to Frank's office with an idea about reaching out to the animal audience, and takes the liberty of hiring Frank an assistant, weaselly sycophant Brice Cummings, who is transparently after his job.When Cross is given the task of heading up a live Christmas Eve broadcast of A Christmas Carol, his life begins to mirror the story he's producing. The decomposing corpse of his mentor, media mogul Lew Hayward who had died of a heart attack seven years prior, comes back to visit to tell him the error of his ways, or as Lew puts it ""All my success and prestige ended on the 14th hole when I dropped dead"", and warns a similar doom is befalling Frank. Lew also tells him three Ghosts will come. Frank awakens in his office, seemingly a nightmare, but Lew causes Frank's phone to call Claire Phillips, Frank's warm-hearted ex-girlfriend.The Ghost of Christmas Past appears as a loudmouthed New York City cab driver, and takes Frank back to his childhood in 1955 where his mother Doris Cross is watching The Lone Ranger with him, until his drunk and angry father Earl Cross comes home after a hard day of working at the meat packing plant, and gives him a side of veal for a Christmas present when Frank wanted a train set. Mrs. Cross says Mr. Cross was supposed to go to the toy store, and Frank's father snarls that Frank should buy his own toys. The ghost chides Frank for not doing anything in his youth except watch TV, then takes him to his late teens in 1968 when he had his first job at the TV station, where at a Christmas party he met Claire, then 1969 for his first anniversary with Claire, where they enjoy a Christmas with simple gifts. The Ghost of Christmas Past finally takes him to 1971, the year in which he chose his job as ""Frisbee the Dog"" over Claire, and to have dinner with Lew Hayward (who was the president of the network at the time) instead of with friends. The sequence shows how Frank gradually became the man he is in the present, first through his father, who was a blue-collar version of Frank, who in the 1955 scene ranted about how most men at the meatpacking plant are lazy slobs who make up excuses to get out of work, and in the 1971 scene when Frank breaks up with Claire because her friends offered no connections to get ahead.The Ghost of Christmas Present then appears as a life-size pixie who's cheerful, childlike demeanor offsets her violent behavior; she shows him how Grace's family lives in poverty because of his stinginess and how much his brother misses him.After the second ghost's visit, Eliot Loudermilk, now deranged and drunk after spending Christmas on the streets, storms the office with a Double-barrel shotgun and tries to murder Frank. The Ghost of Christmas Future, a seven-foot-tall ghoul with a TV screen for a face, appears and shows Frank a future in which Calvin has ended up in a mental hospital, Claire has become as cold and uncaring as he is, and only James and James' wife attend his sparse and sterile cremation.As he feels his body being burned, Frank finally sees the error of his ways and begs for a second chance. He awakens back in his office, just as the live broadcast is approaching its climax. The reformed Frank rehires Loudermilk at a considerable salary increase, and enlists his help to hijack the live broadcast. Frank steps in front of the rolling studio cameras, and publicly wishes his viewers a Merry Christmas and delivers a manic but heartfelt speech about the true meaning of Christmas. Calvin urges him to add Tiny Tim's phrase, ""God bless us, everyone"", finally breaking free of his mute condition. Claire rushes to the studio, aided by the Ghost of Christmas Past, who offers her a ride, and comes on set as Frank reconciles with her, sharing a romantic kiss as Grace and the other television workers start to sing ""Put a Little Love in Your Heart"". Frank looks up to see Lew Hayward and the Ghosts commend him, then vanish."

After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick fighting match in Bangkok, Trautman visits the construction site of the Buddhist temple Rambo is helping to build and asks Rambo to join him on a mission to Afghanistan. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including FIM-92 Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, Afghani rebels, who are fighting the Soviets in the Soviet-Afghan War. Despite showing him photos of civilians suffering atrocities under Soviet military intervention, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.While in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and coerced for information by Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney).Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) and convinces Griggs to give him an unofficial operation, despite Griggs' warning that the U.S. government will deny any knowledge of his actions if killed or caught. Rambo immediately flies to Peshawar, Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa Ghanin (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to Khost, a village deep in the Afghan desert, after Rambo threatens him, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept imprisoned.The Mujahideen in the village, led by the village's main leader Masoud (Spiros Focas), are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place. When their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants has informed the Soviets of Rambo's presence, they agree to help him. Rambo shows his fighting skills when he mans a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and uses it to shoot down one Soviet helicopter. However, the village is mostly devastated.Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his plan to free Trautman. Approaching at night, Rambo picks his way through the mine field and barbed wire surrounding the camp and infiltrates the camp's prison. He finds Trautman but is unsuccessful in freeing him. Hamid is shot in the leg and Rambo himself is wounded, with wood fragments impaling him in the side. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends the boy and Mousa away to safety, before cauterising his own wound with gunpowder from a round of ammo and an open flame.The next day, Rambo returns to the base, after scaling a cliff on the fort's perimeter to avoid detection, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower. After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and escapes from the base. However, the helicopter is damaged as it departs and soon crashes, forcing Rambo and Trautman to continue on foot.After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman eliminate several Soviet Spetsnaz commandos, including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Soviet tanks, headed by Zaysen. Zaysen warns them to drop their weapons and comply to his orders saying that they cannot escape and he wants to take them back alive. Unwilling to surrender that easily, Trautman says to Rambo ""what do you say, John?"" and Rambo replies, loading his gun, ""Fuck 'em"". Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield by the hundreds in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Soviets. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and John are wounded, Rambo commandeers a Soviet tank and kills Zaysen by driving the giant gun barrel into the Soviet colonel's helicopter. Somehow, Rambo survives the explosion and gets out of the tank.At the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home. The movie ends with two quotes: ""This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan."" and ""I am like a bullet, filled with lead and made to kill"""
Bull Durham,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094812/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A fan who has an affair with one minor-league baseball player each season meets an up-and-coming pitcher and the experienced catcher assigned to him. It's the start of the minor league baseball season, and Annie Savoy, for who baseball is *the* religion, is going through the annual process of choosing the one player on her home team of the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League, he who she will take under her wings, sexual and otherwise, solely for the season, and who has always gone on to have his best year as a player. She has narrowed her choice to two recent acquires: Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, the wild neophyte pitcher with a wicked fastball - the pitch on which he solely relies - but can't aim, the more he thinks about it, the more erratic the pitch gets, while he doesn't appreciate anyone criticizing him or it in believing he knows best in his lack of self-awareness; and catcher Crash Davis, the veteran who has been around the minor leagues for twelve years and who was brought in solely to harness and reign in Ebby's power. While Ebby would gladly accept Annie's offer in seeing sex as an inherent part of his being, Crash, who is as philosophical in being a thinker as he is athletic, takes himself out of the running - the first player ever to do so - as, although attracted to her, does not see sex as the ""game"" she seems to treat it, especially as he knows he is nearing the end of his baseball playing career. Part of Annie's initial transformation of Ebby is to give him that nickname he sorely wants - Nuke - to match his pitches. Thus begins Annie, Crash and Nuke's three-way season-long relationship as they evolve because of it as baseball, sexual and human beings.—Huggo Crash is an aging minor league ball player, brought up from another team to mature a young pitcher with maturity problems. Both of them become involved with Ann, a baseball groupie with her own perspective on the game.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> ""Crash"" Davis (Kevin Costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A (advanced) Durham Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby LaLoosh (Tim Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski) about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby's haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of ""Meat"", and they get off to a rocky start.Thrown into the mix is Annie (Susan Sarandon), a lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the ""Church of Baseball"" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with Crash and Ebby, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to ""try out"" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he ""believes in"", ending with ""I believe in long, slow, soft, deep wet kisses that last three days... Good night"".Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname ""Nuke""). Crash forces Nuke to learn ""not to think"" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his ""heat"" (fastballs). Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in ""The Show"" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for ""the 21 greatest days of my life"" and to which he has tried for years to return.Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.After a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season. By the end of the movie, Nuke is called up to the majors and the Bulls, now having no use for his mentor, release Crash. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. Nuke leaves for the big leagues, ending his relationship with Annie, and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice.Crash joins another team, the Asheville Tourists, and breaks the minor league record for career home runs. We see Nuke one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichéd answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with ""boys"". Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor league team in Visalia. Both characters end one phase of their lives and begin another, Annie and Crash dancing in her candle-lit living room."
A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095742/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Freddy Krueger returns once again to terrorize the dreams of the remaining Dream Warriors, as well as those of a young woman who may be able to defeat him for good. Following up the previous Nightmare film, the dream demon Freddy Krueger is resurrected from his apparent demise, and rapidly tracks down all three of the surviving Elm Street kids. However, Kristen Parker soon realizes that Freddy is taking advantage of that unknown power she now wields to pull a new group of teenage children into his foul domain. Can she finally defeat Freddy or is it already too late?—David Thiel <d-thiel@uiuc.edu> With the boiler room at the creepy house on 1428 Elm Street forever cold after the events inA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), lucky survivors Kristen, Kincaid, and Joey try to pick up the pieces and live free again. But no force on Earth can contain pure evil. As the gruesome dream manipulator returns from the dead, hungry for teenage souls, fresh meat gets a taste of Freddy's horror. Now, it's up to the remaining Dream Warriors to finish the charred stalker of the dream world off once and for all. But when death is only an illusion, can the last of the Elm Street Children end what Nancy started inA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)?—Nick Riganas Kristen, Joey and Kincaid have been released from the Westin Hills Asylum and are now living normal lives and attending high school. Kristen has managed to make some new friends: Alice, a young, bright girl who is a frequent daydreamer; Sheila, a brainy, quiet black girl with asthma; and Debbie, a tall, tough girl who hates bugs. She has also found herself a boyfriend, Rick, a martial arts enthusiast who is also Alice's brother.Kristen begins to have bad dreams and feels as though Freddy has once again come back from the dead. During one of her nightmares, she pulls Kincaid and Joey into her dream as she explores the deserted Elm Street house. In school the next day, Kincaid and Joey confront Kristen about pulling them into the dream.Kincaid wakes up one night and finds himself locked in the trunk of an old junked car. When he opens the hood, he realizes that he is in the same salvage yard that Freddy's body was buried in. Kincaid spies his dog, Jason, digging and urinating in the ground nearby. Freddy then resurrects from the ground after which a pile of junked cars crash down on him. Freddy quickly recoups and kills Kincaid. Later that night Joey is also killed by Freddy.The following day at school, Kristen is concerned when her friends fail to show up for class. She confides to Alice about nightmares. Kristen hits her head and passes out when she discovers both her friends missing, being attacked by Freddy but revived in time. After she learns of the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen goes to the actual Elm Street house, with Rick, Dan, and Alice. Rick tells Dan the story of Freddy, and Alice reveals a part of the dream master spell. Alice suggests to Kristen that she is in control of her own dreams. However, Alice also looks down at the ground and sees something, a chalk drawing of the house, that only Kristen has been able to see. Clearly, she senses something. At home that night, her mother gives her a sedative to help her sleep. When Kristen falls asleep this time, on Alice's advice, she tries to convert nightmares into pleasant dreams, to no avail. While she meets a child named Alice in her dream, creating a sand castle, even in her good dreams, Freddy appears and ruins everything. Kristen eventually finds herself in Freddy's boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. When Freddy is about to kill her, she screams for Alice. Alice appears suddenly in the boiler room just as Krueger kills Kristen by throwing her into fire. Before Kristen dies, she sends her power, the power to pull people into her dreams, to Alice. Before the power can reach her, it passes through Freddy first.Alice awakens immediately, realizing that Kristen's in danger. She turns out to be right, as Kristen's room is on fire. As Alice tries to understand what has happened, and who exactly Freddy is, her friends begin to die. First, Sheila and Rick are killed. While taking a test, Alice accidentally pulls Sheila into a dream where Freddy is waiting; the same thing happens to Rick later. Yet, after every death, including Kristen's, Alice picks up new talents and abilities. She also picks up the dream powers of the children who have died. She is obviously Freddy's supernatural opposite, albeit too weak to truly conquer or even resist him yet. After his death, Alice teams up with Dan Jordan, who was one of Rick's closest friends. Together with Dan, Alice tries to get to Debbie, their last surviving friend, before Freddy finds her. Unbeknown to the two teens, Freddy is able to control their movements. Trapping Alice and Dan in a time loop, Freddy is able to reach Debbie and kill her (by transforming her into a cockroach and trapping her inside a roach motel and then crushing her) before Alice and Dan intervene.Following a car accident, where Dan is injured and rushed to the hospital, Alice returns home to prepare for one final battle with Freddy. Alice goes to sleep to help Dan before Freddy can kill him. As Alice and Dan search for Freddy, Dan is injured. Alice wills him awake right at the moment the doctors wake Dan and he is pulled from the dreamworld. Alice, facing Freddy alone, attempts to use all of her newly absorbed abilities against him. The fight is relatively equal, except that she has a mortal body and he has not, giving him the advantage of immortality. It's an advantage that proves nearly too great to overcome. He declares that he's been guarding his gate for too long to be taken down by her. But just as he is preparing to kill her, she recalls the final verse of the dream master spell. For the first and only time, someone defeats Freddy, by using the power of the spell to make him see the evil that is inside. Using her power as guardian of the gate of good dreams (which Kristen never was, nor was Nancy,) Alice releases the tortured souls that Freddy imprisoned into the gates of good dreams where he can no longer harm them. Krueger's clothes fall lifelessly to the floor. The film ends with Dan and Alice at a fountain some time later. She tosses a coin in and makes a wish. As she and Dan depart, she decides to keep the wish to herself as Freddy's image appears in the ripples left in the fountain from the tossed coin."
The Land Before Time,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095489/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An orphaned brontosaurus teams up with other young dinosaurs in order to reunite with their families in a valley. An orphaned brontosaurus named Littlefoot sets off in search of the legendary Great Valley. A land of lush vegetation where the dinosaurs can thrive and live in peace. Along the way he meets four other young dinosaurs, each one a different species, and they encounter several obstacles and the evil predator Sharptooth as they learn to work together in order to survive.—Scott Lane <rslane@ix.netcom.com> Embark on a journey into an enchanting prehistoric adventure with dinosaur pals Littlefoot, Cera, Spike, Ducky and Petrie in this acclaimed animated classic for the entire family. In a long-ago age of rumbling volcanoes and perilous earthquakes, a young brontosaurus named Littlefoot suddenly finds himself on his own. Setting out to find the lush feeding grounds of the legendary Great Valley, he meets up with four other young dinosaurs who agree to join his quest. On their daring trek across a landscape filled with excitement and danger, the brave little band encounters hungry predators and daunting challenges as they discover new lessons in life and the importance of teamwork.—A-Colozza Littlefoot, a brontosaurus child, must fend for himself when his mother is killed (shades of Bambi). With several other orphaned dinosaurs, Littlefoot seeks out the fabled Great Valley, where food and shelter is plentiful. Along the way, the kiddie Dinos learn several vital (and politically correct) life lessons, all the while keeping themselves scarce whenever the fierce tyrannosaurus galumph into view. During the age of the dinosaurs, a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an oasis known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished ""longneck"" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a ""three-horn"", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with long-necks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: ""three-horns"", ""spike-tails"", ""swimmers"", and ""flyers"". That night, as Littlefoot follows a ""hopper"", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large ""Sharptooth"" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old ""clubtail"" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the ""Mountains that Burn"".
Later, Littlefoot meets a ""bigmouth"" named Ducky and a ""flyer"" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching ""spiketail"", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.
The next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a tar pit, and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of ""domeheads"" (Pachycephalosaurus) who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Ashamed of her fear and behavior, and reluctant to admit her mistake, Cera leaves them in tears. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.
The plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug."

Biloxi Blues,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094746/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of young recruits go through boot camp during the Second World War in Biloxi, Mississippi. From the play by Neil Simon. New York City teenager Eugene Jerome starts military service thoughtfully yet patriotically prepared to take part in World War II. At boot camp in Biloxi, Mississippi, he faces the brutally opposed views of other recruits, which he must live with. Still they must bind, if not bond, facing the sadistic drill sergeant during their physically ruthless and mentally abusive training, which is heading for tragedy. Meanwhile, their boyish minds wander often to sexual frustrations, from obsession with potency (and escaping virginity) to prejudice against gays. Armed only with his sense of humor, Eugene is determined to leave camp with everything he came with.—KGF Vissers New York City teenager Eugene Jerome enlists in the United States Army and is sent to basic training in Biloxi, Mississippi during the last year of World War II. Expecting the army to be dolls, donuts and USO dances, he instead encounters a sadistic drill sergeant and a platoon of often hostile recruits. He learns the hardships of war through boot camp, to accept other people's differences, falls in love and loses his virginity to a prostitute. Armed with only his sense of humor, he is determined to leave camp with everything he came with, as he and the other recruits must endure the rigorous training and abuse from their instructor.—Jason Ihle <jrihl@conncoll.edu> In 1945, during World War II, a train full of draftees are heading to Biloxi, Mississippi for boot camp. Among the recruits are Private Eugene Jerome (who wants to be a writer and makes observations about everyone in a private journal), Arnold Epstein (another New York Jew and the intellectual in the group), Joseph Wykowski (the largest recruit and likeliest to be the best soldier in their unit), Roy Selridge (a loudmouth and seeming sycophant to Wykowski), Don Carney (who has aspirations to be a singer) and James Hennesey (a mostly soft-spoken type). When they arrive at their training camp,Jerome comments that the heat is unbearable. They immediately meet their drill sergeant, Merwin Toomey, who tells them that he was wounded during the war in Europe and has a steel plate in his skull. Toomey has a jovial wit but also a hard edge and Jerome and Epstein run afoul of him when he tells everyone to fall in for muster: Epstein mocks Toomey's order that they all answer to their names with ""Ho!"" and Jerome stumbles over the response, prompting Toomey to demand he name one of his comrades in order that he do push-ups in punishment. Eventually, Jerome finds himself unpunished while everyone in the platoon carries out Toomey's orders.The platoon reports for chow, finding the food detestable. Toomey stops by their table and tells them he plans to have them march for 15 miles in the morning at 5 AM. Epstein objects, saying that the platoon needs rest after their 3 day train ride. Toomey excuses Epstein from the march after he cleans the barracks latrine, adding that if it doesn't meet his rigorous standards, Wykowski and Selridge will perform 200 push-ups as a punishment. After he leaves, Jerome mocks Toomey -- Wykowski doesn't like it because Toomey seems to have exceptional hearing and perception; he seems to hear even the lowest-spoken comments. When they line up to surrender their trays, those that haven't eaten their entire meal are sent back to their seats to finish, including Carney, Jerome and Epstein.Toomey takes the platoon out for a long march through the Mississippi swampland. They soon stop at a large pond. Toomey asks for ideas to cross the ""obstacle"" and orders Jerome to pick a volunteer. When Toomey orders Jerome to give him the name of the recruit who will wade into the water, Jerome refuses to answer. Toomey, pulling the same trick that he did during muster, has Jerome ""whisper"" the name into his ear, which turns out to be Wykowski. Wykowski almost immediately sinks into the swamp and the platoon marches out, looking for a better place to cross while 2 other recruits fish Wykowski out of the water.That night Jerome suggests that they all share fantasies, detailing what they'd do if they knew they were going to die in combat one week from that day. Seeing an opportunity for a small contest for a cash award, Jerome will act as the judge, grading their responses. Selridge claims he'd have sex with 7 of the richest women in the world and receive a million dollars from each for his performance, but he'd need another day to spend all the money. Carney says he'd sing at Carnegie Hall and become famous. Hennesey says he'd spend the time with his family, which Jerome calls an honest answer. Wykowski says he'd have sex with the Queen of England, a response that Jerome calls completely immoral but grades very high. Epstein is reluctant to reveal his but with some gentle persuasion from Jerome he tells everyone that he'd like to order Toomey to perform 200 push-ups in front of the entire platoon. Everyone admits that it's the best response so far and Jerome gives Epstein an A. Jerome goes last and says he'd simply like to lose his virginity and meet the perfect girl. Selridge, given the responsibility of grading Jerome, finds the fantasy smarmy and gives him a C-, making Epstein the winner. Wykowski, who makes no effort to his his dislike of Jews, objects and a minor fight breaks out. Toomey intervenes and orders everyone to sleep while Epstein collects his money.The platoon is given a weekend's leave. Jerome and Carney plan to join Selridge and Wykowski on their trip to a prostitute's apartment in Biloxi. Wykowski storms in yelling about how all the money he'd saved for the big weekend was stolen out of his wallet in his footlocker. Toomey suddenly appears and orders everyone to line up. He tells them he's heard about the theft and that he wants the guilty party to come forward, saying they will not avoid punishment but that it would be honorable to admit their wrongdoing. When no one steps forward, Toomey begins a countdown. Suddenly, Arnold Epstein goes to his own wallet and gives the amount stolen to Wykowski. Toomey is flustered, admitting that he'd taken the money out of Wykowski's footlocker while his men were asleep the night before. His intention was to teach Wykowski a lesson for leaving his footlocker unlocked but he never figured that Epstein would undermine his authority. He dismisses everyone for leave and chastises Epstein in a private meeting. Epstein tells Toomey that he saw him take the money and that he doesn't understand how the sergeant will teach a proper lesson by committing his own crime. Toomey gives Epstein latrine duty again.In Biloxi, the guys arrive at the prostitute's house. Wykowski goes first while Selridge, Carney and Jerome discuss sexual etiquette. Wykowksi emerges satisfied and leaves for the USO hall's party for GIs. After Selridge disappears into the bedroom, Jerome and Carney decide to leave. Jerome forgets his hat and meets Selridge stalking out, claiming he'd passed his peak. Jerome finds his hat and is met by Rowena who beckons him into her room. Jerome is quite nervous and reluctant but Rowena coaches him into the act.At the USO hall, the rest of the guys are scoping out the local women they can dance with -- most of them seem to have come from a Catholic school in Biloxi. Jerome arrives in quite a light mood from his experience and finds a young, pretty woman named Daisy who accepts his offer to dance. The two have an innocent conversation and find that they are quite attracted to each other. They dance for what seems like hours until the hall closes.That night, after they return from leave, Wykowski finds Jerome's footlocker unlocked. Inside he finds Jerome's diary and all the private thoughts Jerome has had about everyone in the platoon. Jerome returns to find that his comrades are very resentful of his thoughts: Wykowski is considered a brutish thug but the type of soldier who will one day be highly decorated for his efforts. Selridge, while holding Jerome back in a headlock, has to listen while Wykowski reveals a name Selridge shouts in his sleep, that of his mother. Jerome believes that Carney is a good person but is unreliable. Wykowski finally orders Selridge to let Jerome go and he gives back the journal. Epstein grabs it immediately and salaciously asks to read what Jerome has to say about him: Jerome thinks Arnold may be gay. Epstein is insulted.A few nights later an officer, while patrolling the barracks, notices the lights out in the latrine. When he turns them on, he finds two men engaging in a sexual act. One of them jumps out the window before he can be identified, the other is brought in for interrogation. Toomey asks the unidentifiable party to come forward, warning that his name will be revealed when the other confesses. The recruits speculate and discuss the issue, several of them objecting to gay men sneaking into the Army and others, like Selridge, saying people should be able to live how they wish. Days after, while out on a march, Toomey's platoon is stopped by the military police. The MPs have Hennesey separated from the rest of the company, taking him away in their jeep.One night Jerome invites Epstein to join him for a drink on the base. Epstein refuses, still stinging from Jerome's assumption that he's gay. Jerome says he knows Arnold isn't gay but he thought he might be since he never talked about women. Just then and extremely drunk Toomey comes out of his quarters and demands that Epstein join him while holding a loaded .45 pistol. Jerome moves to protect Arnold, saying he's a witness. Toomey decides to order Jerome into his quarters instead. Inside, he tells Jerome that he's gotten a notice that he's to report to a veterans hospital to have the plate in his head removed. Angry at being forcibly retired from the Army, he plans to shoot Jerome with the intent of being sent to prison instead. He also reveals that he knows about their fantasy game. He offers money for his own bet, saying that he'd like to take one of the worst recruits in his command and turn them into the best soldier he's seen. He then orders Jerome at gunpoint to disarm him. Jerome believes he can't do it but he tries amid Toomey's threats. He struggles for several seconds with Toomey, who won't give up his pistol at first but suddenly loosens his grip. Jerome regains his composure and suggests that Toomey get a good night's sleep. Toomey, smiling and now impressed with Jerome's newfound courage, tells Jerome that in order for his arrest to be properly executed, they need witnesses. When Jerome opens the door, he find Epstein & the rest of the platoon outside the door eavesdropping. Outside the barracks, in heavy rain, Toomey admits his crime to the unit and demands he be brought up on charges for threatening Jerome. Jerome suggests that the decision should be left up to the unit and asks Epstein's opinion. Epstein says there should be no charges but that Toomey should do 200 push-ups in front of the platoon. Toomey enthusiastically does.The platoon, having completed basic training, is next seen on a train heading to the Pacific.

Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095031/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two con men try to settle their rivalry by betting on who can swindle a young American heiress out of fifty thousand dollars first. Wealthy native Brit Lawrence Jamieson, living in Beaumont-sur-Mer on the French Riviera, earns most of his money through big cons on wealthy unsuspecting women. With the help of his associates, corrupt Police Inspector Andre, who provides him most of his intel, and his butler Arthur, he pulls scams such as pretending to be a foreign deposed Prince who needs money to finance a secret war to liberate his people. Beaumont-sur-Mer, and thus his world, is invaded by brash American Freddy Benson, another con man whose targets are also wealthy unsuspecting women. Lawrence believes Freddy is the Jackal, a con man whose true identity is unknown, but who is known to be working his way through Europe. While Lawrence works on thousands of dollars per scam, Freddy works only on tens or if he is lucky hundreds of dollars. Lawrence's efforts to get Freddy out of his territory are unsuccessful, so when Freddy figures out that Lawrence is a con man like he is, he decides to blackmail Lawrence to work under him to learn the art of the sophisticated and thus earn more lucrative con. Eventually, Lawrence and Freddy have a difference in how to operate their joint cons, so they issue each other an ultimatum: the person who is able to con a mark out of fifty thousand dollars first will get the French Riviera as their territory, with the other having to leave forever. Who they choose is naive and slightly bumbling American ""soap Queen"" Janet Colgate, who has just arrived in the area. The nature of how each tries to get the fifty thousand dollars from Janet changes over time, each needing to play off the other's con. But their focus may change with more information learned about the situation, as well as some external factors they did not anticipate.—Huggo Lawrence and Freddie are con men, big-time and small-time, respectively. They unsuccessfully attempt to work together only to find that this town (on the French Riviera) ain't big enough for the two of them. They agree to a ""loser leaves"" bet. The bet brings out the best and worst in the two.—Rob Hartill Freddy Benson, a con man, lives off women by waking their compassion with shocking stories about his fake fate. One day in beautiful Beaumont-sur-Mer, he meets Lawrence Jamieson, who shares the same passion, works the rich ladies with the same scheme, but in quite a different league. With the knowledge of his profession, Freddy forces Lawrence to teach him high-society behavior, so that he himself can earn a major living. When time comes to say goodbye, Freddy decides to stay a little longer. As there is no way two con men can work a town that small at the same time, Lawrence and Freddy agree on a settlement: The first one to extract fifty thousand dollars from a young female target wins, the other leaves town. The sum is no match for Lawrence, the age of the lady no match for Freddy. Let the games begin.—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> Lawrence Jamieson (Michael Caine) is an intelligent and sophisticated British con artist. With the help of his manservant Arthur (Ian McDiarmid) and corrupt police official Andre (Anton Rogers), he seduces wealthy women and cons them out of money by posing as a prince in exile trying to raise money for his country's ""freedom fighters."" The film opens on an unseen woman taking off her pearls to hand over to Lawrence, with him feigning protest until finally ""caving in"" and taking them from her.The main story begins with Lawrence and Andre setting up the scam on a wealthy woman, Fanny Eubanks (Barbara Harris), and they're later seen dividing up the spoils before escaping on a train to the fictional town of Beaumont-Sur-Mer. While on the train, Lawrence spots a small-time American hustler named Freddy Benson (Steve Martin), whose version of the same scam is a sob story about a sick grandmother. Now Lawrence thinks that Freddy's tactics are kind of clumsy, which has him thinking that Freddy could conceivably scare away his own targets. Lawrence attempts to trick Freddy into choosing a different destination, and he manages to succeed when Andre hires a woman to divert him to Portofino. The next morning Andre notes to Lawrence that there's another scammer in town, known as The Jackal. Lawrence isn't too worried about The Jackal, though. Andre gives Lawrence the information on their next target, but shortly thereafter they spot Freddy in a car with her. Lawrence gets Andre to approach the woman with evidence that Freddy is a con man. She files a complaint and Freddy is arrested and put on a plane out of town. However, after Freddy meets Fanny Eubanks on the plane, he blackmails Lawrence into taking him on as a pupil.There's a montage during which Lawrence attempts to teach Freddy style and refinement, with limited success. He then involves Freddy in his cons, having him play his mentally challenged brother Ruprecht to scare away women Lawrence has seduced (and now, in the new con, proposed to). However, when Lawrence refuses to give Freddy a cut of the profits because he considers Freddy to be an unpaid apprentice, Freddy quits. It turns out that having Freddy play Ruprecht was also a scam, part of an attempt to get him to quit. But Freddy isn't done scamming women, and he's not inclined to leave town.Lawrence is unwilling to share his territory with Freddy, so the two agree on a bet: the first to con $50,000 out of a selected mark wins, and the other must leave town. They target new arrival Janet Colgate, the naïve ""United States Soap Queen"" (Glenne Headly). Freddy poses as a crippled U.S. Navy veteran. He starts with the grandmother scam but then escalates it to saying that his need for a wheelchair is psychosomatic, and for treatment by the celebrated psychiatrist Dr. Emil Schuffhausen of Liechtenstein would cost $50,000. When Janet shows sympathy to Freddy, Lawrence poses as Dr. Schuffhausen and agrees to treat Freddy but stipulates that Janet pay the $50,000 fee directly to him.Under the guise of continuing Freddy's treatment, Lawrence dances with Janet and taunts Freddy, raising the ire of some nearby British sailors, whom Freddy convinces to waylay Lawrence later that evening.Lawrence discovers that Janet is not actually a wealthy soap heiress; in fact she won her vacation and ""Soap Queen"" title in a contest; nevertheless, she plans to liquidate most of her assets to pay for Freddy's treatment. Because he only cons wealthy women, Lawrence attempts to cancel the bet. Freddy counters with a new bet: Janet herself, with the first to have sex with her declared the winner. Lawrence is disgusted and refuses to seduce Janet, but agrees to bet on whether Freddy succeeds.
As they arrive at Lawrence's place, the sailors grab Lawrence with the intent of taking him to the airport and dropping him into a departing plane. Freddy then rushes to Janet's hotel room, where he demonstrates his love by standing and walking to her. However, Lawrence has secretly been present the whole time and declares Freddy cured. In the hallway later, Lawrence explains that the sailors released him after discovering that he is a Royal Naval Reserve officer. Lawrence leaves Freddy at a party with the sailors - who, realizing that he can walk, haze him and keep him occupied until Lawrence can put Janet on an airplane home. When Lawrence returns to the hotel, Freddy is getting along famously with the sailors-but they've also super-glued him to the wall. Lawrence bids him ""Auf Wiedersehen"" and leaves.Freddy goes back up to Janet's room and finds her gone. Moments later, though, Janet turns up in the room. She tells him that she couldn't leave and declares her love for him. They kiss and begin undressing. Andre reports this to Lawrence, who accepts his defeat graciously. He waits for Freddy to return and gloat over his victory, but it's Janet who shows up instead. She's in tears and says that Freddy stole the money her father sent. Not only that, she suspects that Freddy could walk the entire time. Disgusted, Lawrence calls Andre to have Freddy arrested, gives Janet a bag containing $50,000 of his own money, and takes her to the airport.Before her plane departs, Janet returns Lawrence's bag, refusing to take what isn't hers. Andre arrives with Freddy, who claims that Janet stole his wallet and clothes. Lawrence disbelieves him, pointing out Janet's honesty in returning the $50,000. But when he opens his bag, he finds that the money has been replaced with Freddy's clothes and a note from Janet in which she reveals herself to be the Jackal. Freddy is furious, but Lawrence is absolutely delighted at their both having been deceived so skillfully.A week later, Freddy and Lawrence sit at his villa and contemplate their loss. They are about to part ways when Janet, posing as a New York City real estate agent, arrives in a yacht filled with wealthy people. She prompts the startled Lawrence and Freddy to assume roles in her scheme and then, after sending her guests up to the house to refresh themselves, takes the pair aside and announces that, while she made three million dollars the previous year, their fifty thousand was ""the most fun."" The three link arms and, under the closing credits, they head to the house to fleece their newest victims."

As the two rivalling families half-heartedly try to spend quality time together, a string of undeserved misfortunes and mini-disasters pave the way for the ultimate showdown between clans.

Big-hearted Chicago family man Chet has brought his family to a lakeside resort area, and although his wife and kids aren't quite as excited as he is, Chet has high hopes for the vacation. However, his optimism is sabotaged when his obnoxious brother-in-law Roman drops in unexpectedly, along with his snooty, strange family.

Chet is a fun-loving father and husband looking for a get away for his family. All is going as planned when four unexpected visitors show up with a video camera in hand at the lake resort lodge.The four unexpected visitors are Connie's outgoing sister Kate (Annette Bening), Kate's know-it-all investment broker husband Roman Craig (Dan Aykroyd), and Kate and Roman's 10-year-old twin daughters Mara (Rebecca Gordon) and Cara (Hilary Gordon) who arrive to suprise Chet and Connie, having decided not to vacation in Europe.Roman is a typical Mercedes-driving, investment focused, '80s yuppie, and he and Kate live in the posh Chicago suburb of Oak Park. Roman seems to take pleasure in making sure others are well aware of his wealth and (supposed) expertise on many subjects, while Chet both finds his brother-in-law annoying and intreging at the same time.During the first night, Chet tells a ghost stories at the family BBQ which includes a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet once met face to face earlier in his life right at the very cabin they are in. During the first night, a family of racoons raid the garbage cans outside the house, leaving an angry Chet to clean up the mess the next morning.The following day, the two families decide to go out on the lake for water skiing. Roman describes the remote northern woods location as ""God's Country"" and prefers speedboats over pontoon boats. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an adventure water ski ride, tensions between families erupt. Roman proceeds to get on Chet's nerves so much so that Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his eldest son Buck tries to romance local girl Cammie (Lucy Deakins) whom he meets at a local pool hall that evening.In this subplot, Buck and Cammie's teen romance sparks at a local amusement park when they go out the following evening on their first date. The budding romance goes well until Buck's father Chet is challenged to eat the entire Paul Bunyan 96 oz. roast at a family dinner, which causes Buck to break the date. The next day, Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak with him.Another day later, Chet shares his love for family when Chet gives his son a ring from his father. It is the same ring that Chet's father gave him when Chet was a young boy in the northern woods.Adventures continue at the local amusement park at the golf driving range, go-carts aces, and horseback riding path. Chet negotiates a ride with his horse only to find the horse runs away. Chet is forced to walk back to the barn where his family is enjoying some libations.Sisters Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, ironically, it emerges when Roman confides in Chet that he has made a bad investment and is flat broke. He hasn't told Kate, and was planning to offer Chet a $25,000 'investment'. Roman describes how he hasn't traded on the floors in Chicago in two years. He now wears a blue coat to fetch coffee and has lost everything. This is the reason why he came to the Great Outdoors to hit up family man, Chet for the money.Meanwhile, during a thunderstorm, the twins go missing and fall into a poorly blocked-off former mica mine shaft. Chet and Roman search for and find them. Chet encourages Roman to be a father for the first time to his kids. Whilst Chet gets a rope, Roman summons up all his courage and rescues the twins. While sitting on dynamite, Roman rescues his girls out of the Pechoggin mine.Chet, not knowing they are out of the mine, discovers in the mineshaft, the 'Bald-Headed Bear', which supposedly attacked Chet many years ago. It chases him through the woods to the house, smashes through the front door and rampages through the house. Just as the bald-headed bear stands on two feet and climbs up stairs to attack Roman, the cabin owner arrives armed with a shotgun. Chet takes the gun and shoots the bear's rear end, causing its rear to become exposed. The bear with bald head and rear, runs out of the cabin and the families are safe.The following morning, the two families part ways on good terms. Both families share how they enjoyed their vacation together in the Wisconsin northern woods. Roman's last words to Chet are ""Race you home,"" which means that Roman's family will be moving in with Chet and leaving their Oak Park home. Cammie shows up and makes up with Buck before he leaves, and part ways and end their summer romance. Family guy, Chet, and his family head back to the Chicago area in a race for the good parking spot in their garage.The closing credits feature Roman at the Pechoggin Lodge dancing up a storm with the other barnuts.After the credits, those three rambunctious raccoons that have wreaked havoc at the lodge throughout the movie have the last word. They make fun of their brown bear friend who is ""bald on both ends now""."

When Binky suddenly goes into labor, the couple rushes to the small town of Jupiter Hollow and to the local hospital, a private facility reserved exclusively for the employees of Hollowmade Furniture, the small town's business. Mr. Shelton buys the company on the spot, and Binky gives birth to identical twin girls. At the same time, Jupiter Hollow hillbilly resident Iona Ratliff (Patricia Gaul) arrives at the hospital and also gives birth to twin girls. Amid the chaos, the elderly and near-sighted nurse puts the babies in the wrong cribs, giving each couple a mixed pair. Mr. Shelton proposes they name the children Rose and Sadie, after his great aunts. Overhearing them from the hallway, Iona's husband, Garth (J.C. Quinn), (whom now have eight children to support) suggests the same names for their own twin daughters.Forty-some years later in the present day 1988, Rose (Lily Tomlin) and Sadie Shelton (Bette Midler) are the successful co-owners of their late father's corporation, Moramax. While the ruthlessly business-minded Sadie treats her employees and bratty son Jason with contempt and hate as her late father did, Rose Shelton (who is really from the Ratliff offspring) is flighty and dreams of settling down in the country with her noncommittal boyfriend, Dr. Jay Marshall (Michael Gross). As part of a new business plan, Sadie proposes they liquidate Hollowmade, but the board informs her that she must receive approval from company stockholders.Although Sadie assures the board members that the people of Jupiter Hollow support the sale, Rose Ratliff (also Lily Tomlin in a dual role), now Hollowmade's forewoman, sends a letter to Moramax threatening to fly to New York City in protest. Sadie Ratliff (also Bette Midler) (who is really a Shelton offspring), and yearns to escape small-town Jupiter Hollow, decides to accompany her sister and start a new life in the big city. Moramax employee Graham Sherbourne (Edward Hermann) reads Rose's letter, which she signed using only her first initial. Sadie sends Graham to find the Ratliffs and prevent them from sabotaging the meeting.On the day of the Ratliff sisters' arrival in New York City, the Shelton sisters go to the airport to greet a prospective Hollowmade buyer, Italian businessman Fabio Alberici (Michele Placido).

Over dinner, Roone criticizes city life and unwittingly appeals to Rose's secret desire to settle down in the country.In the lobby, Sadie Ratliff bumps into Michael, who has fallen for the woman he believes to be his reformed ex-wife. They agree to have lunch the following afternoon, and he kisses her goodbye. After an evening of flirting, Sadie Shelton and Mr. Alberici consummate their business deal. Meanwhile, Graham detains Roone in his suite, but discovers that the Ratliffs are actually a pair of sisters.In the morning, Rose and Sadie Ratliff have breakfast together in the hotel restaurant to plan their protest at the stockholders meeting. Sadie purposely spills syrup on her jacket, using the accident as an excuse to spend ""Sly's"" bribe money on a new polka-dotted outfit at the hotel boutique. Moments after she leaves to change, Sadie Shelton takes her place at the table. Rose criticizes the businesswoman's severe gray suit, so Sadie agrees to swap it for the same polka-dotted ensemble on display in the shop window.As they prepare to leave for the meeting in the hotel conference room, the four women finally cross paths in the lobby ladies room and discover that they are long-lost sisters having been switched at birth with both red-haired Sadies belonging to the Shelton family and both brunette-haired Roses to the Ratliff family.

Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is sent to find and return bail jumper and former Mafia accountant, Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Charles Grodin). The FBI has had no success in locating The Duke, so when Jack finds him in next to no time, they are a little embarrassed. In order to collect his $100,000 fee, Jack must take The Duke from New York to Los Angeles. However, the Mafia and the FBI have other ideas, as does Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton), a rival bounty hunter. On their long cross-country trip to LA, the two get to know each other and they build up a strange friendship.—Rob Hartill Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is a tough bounty hunter has to deliver Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Charles Grodin), who embezzled $15 million from the Mob, but the FBI is after The Duke to testify - the Mob is after him for revenge - and Walsh is after him to just shut up. Will they survive each other and all the other pursuers to a happy ending?—Benjamin Boey Jack Walsh is a Los Angeles based bounty hunter. It's a job he hates, he a former Chicago police officer who was, if rumors are true, run out of town by mob boss Jimmy Serrano. The reasons for his release from the force led to the dissolution of his marriage, his wife and daughter who he has not seen in nine years but who he still loves. Eddie Moscone, a bail bondsman for who Jack often works, convinces him to pick up a specific bail jumper, Jonathan Mardukas, whose whereabouts are unknown. Although Jack negotiates a lucrative contract with Eddie for this job - Eddie who will lose his business if Jonathan is not brought in within five days - Eddie believes Jonathan having been Serrano's accountant should be enough of a drawing card for Jack, Jonathan who embezzled $15 million from his mob boss. Using some contacts and a stolen ID, Jack is able to locate and capture Jonathan on the first day in New York. Out of circumstance, Jack and Jonathan are forced to travel by the proverbial planes, trains and automobiles to get back to LA as many others are also on their tail trying to get their hands on Jonathan. They include: Alonzo Mosely, an FBI agent, and his associates, who have been leading an operation against Serrano for several years; Serrano and his men who do not want to see Jonathan testify in court; and Marvin Dorfler, a rival bounty hunter who Eddie also hires just in case Jack fails, there being no love lost between Jack and Marvin. Some try to persuade Jack to give Jonathan up, using the ""carrot"" of more money than Eddie would be paying, while others have their own moles to be able to follow Jack and Jonathan's whereabouts as they snake west across the country. But the biggest obstacle in Jack getting Jonathan back to Los Angeles within five days may be mild mannered Jonathan himself. Beyond knowing he is an easy target for Serrano if he is in prison and thus who does whatever he can can either to persuade Jack not to turn him in or elude him, Jonathan, based on differences in personality with Jack including having a multitude of phobias, may drive Jack crazy and crazier the longer they are within each other's company.—Huggo A bounty hunter, Jack Walsh, is tasked with tracking down a bail jumper for a large fee. The man he is tracking is the accountant of a major mob boss, a mob boss he had a run in with when he was a policeman in Chicago. It is soon apparent that tracking down the accountant is the least of his worries: the mob and the FBI are also after him.—grantss Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Grodin) is an accountant who embezzled $15 million from Las Vegas gangster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina) and skipped bail. He is hiding in New York when his Los Angeles bail bondsman, Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano), hires bounty hunter Jack Walsh (De Niro) to bring the accountant in. To get the $100,000 bounty, Jack needs to get ""The Duke"" back to L.A. before midnight on Friday, or Eddie forfeits the $450,000 bail and faces bankruptcy.The FBI, led by Special Agent Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto), wants Mardukas under arrest to build their case against Serrano. Alonzo warns Jack not to interfere with his plans, but Jack, under the pretense of accepting, pays no attention, and instead pinches Mosely's identification. Serrano, meanwhile, suspects that Mardukas has access to financial information that could lead to his conviction. Additionally, that information would implicate Serrano and his ties to other mobsters, which could jeopardize his life if exposed. As a result, Serrano intends to have Mardukas killed before he can testify against him in open court.After apprehending Mardukas in Manhattan, Jack is unable to take him to L.A. by plane due to Mardukas' professed fear of flying, which gets them thrown off their transcontinental flight. The pair embark on a wild cross-country chase (with Mardukas even temporarily piloting a plane, proving that his fear of flying was a ruse), relying on various unreliable modes of transportation, all the while dodging the FBI and Serrano's henchmen Tony (Richard Foronjy) and Joey (Robert Miranda). Moscone also hires rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) as insurance in case Jack is unable to deliver Mardukas, but offers him $25,000, claiming he offered the same to Walsh.Throughout their journey, Walsh and The Duke bicker constantly, due to the clash of Walsh's rough-hewn personality and Mardukas' habit of nagging. Much of the movie involves Mardukas' sincere effort to uncover the truth about his captor, a person he suspects is actually a decent man beneath his cynical and embittered exterior. He eventually learns that Jack was a former Chicago undercover detective who refused to go on the take of a heroin dealer he was building a case against. He was then drummed out of the force after being framed for heroin possession by corrupt colleagues and driven out of Chicago, his marriage ended and he became estranged from his family. His ex-wife ended up remarrying one of his colleagues, now a captain, whom Jack insinuates was one of the corrupt members of the force. Jack has not seen his daughter since she was a little girl, and has since then lost all faith in the law, explaining his profession as a bounty hunter. As the plot unfolds, it turns out that the heroin dealer responsible for Jack's framing was Jimmy Serrano himself. Jack, for his part, wants to see the job done so he can retire and open a coffee shop with his promised $100,000 bounty, aware that in doing so, he will most likely be helping Serrano avoid prison. He also has a keen sense of propriety and refuses a bribe from Mardukas, as well as a large cash offering from Serrano's camp in exchange for turning Mardukas over to them.After making it as far as Arizona, the two are chased by dozens of police cars. They narrowly dodge the police, but Mardukas is captured by Dorfler. Finally figuring out that Moscone cheated him and how much The Duke is actually worth, Dorfler decides to give him up to Tony and Joey for $1 million. However, Dorfler inadvertently reveals where he is keeping the fugitive, and is knocked unconscious. Mardukas is captured by Serrano's men, and Dorfler, defeated, decides to go home.Walsh, meanwhile, is finally found by Mosely and his men, and taken into custody. An enraged Walsh calls Moscone and furiously berates him for hiring Dorfler as insurance. Moscone, however, reveals that Dorfler is not delivering The Duke to him, and Walsh realizes that Dorfler has delivered Mardukas to Serrano. Walsh calls Serrano's men and tells them that Mardukas gave him computer disks with enough information to put Serrano away (earlier, Mardukas had informed Walsh that he intended to backup files on to disks but never did). Walsh threatens to turn the disks over to the FBI unless Serrano himself returns The Duke to him at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Walsh tells Mosely and the FBI of his plan to deliver Serrano to them (even though the disks to be used in the sting are blank, Serrano's taking possession of them would be enough to indict him for conspiring to destroy government evidence and obstruction of justice), but will only carry it out if he is allowed to return Mardukas to Moscone personally and collect his money. Mosely, since his primary target is Serrano, accepts Walsh's proposal.At the airport, Serrano and Walsh confront each other for the first time since Jack left Chicago. The exchange is interrupted by Dorfler, who sees the exchange going on, not knowing that the FBI are watching and waiting for Serrano to take possession of the disks. Jack, whose microphone wire gets knocked out by Dorfler, yells to the FBI that Serrano has the disks. The FBI move in, arresting Serrano, his men, and Dorfler.Mosely makes good on his deal with Jack, turning Mardukas over to the bounty hunter. Jack flies the Duke back to LA and calls Eddie Moscone at the airport, telling him he has Mardukas in L.A. before the deadline - but he is letting him go, hanging up on a ranting Moscone. Before Jack can leave, they exchange gifts - Jack hands The Duke his broken watch, and Mardukas hands Jack a money belt he had hidden on his person throughout the film, filled with $300,000 in $1,000 bills: he was planning on leaving before Jack showed up, so he didn't have time to use the money. The two part as friends. Mardukas then disappears, and Jack tries to get a cab. However, since the driver doesn't have change for a thousand dollar bill, he zips up his leather jacket and pulls up his collar, preparing to walk home."
The Dead Pool,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094963/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan must stop a sick secret contest to murder various San Francisco celebrities, with himself being one of the targets. Even though he detests publicity, for once, the tough-as-nails San Francisco Police Department officer, InspectorDirty Harry (1971), has hit the headlines for a good cause, after putting behind bars an infamous mobster. But now, Callahan's name is on a macabre list of soon-to-be-dead celebrities. Before long, the first one dies, the drug-addled rock star, Johnny Squares, and as more violent deaths follow, Callahan now fears that he is next in line. In the meantime, more and more, all indications point to the British horror-film director, Peter Swan. Who is the mastermind behind the anonymous hit-list and the twisted gambling game known as the Dead Pool? Can Harry get to the bottom of this deadly conundrum before it is too late?—Nick Riganas Inspector Harry Callahan, or ""Dirty Harry"" as he is known from the previous four movies in this franchise, is investigating a strange betting game. A list of local celebrities has been handed out, and bets are being taken on who will be the first to die. Things start to get interesting when the name ""Harry Callahan"" appears on the list.—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> Movie director Peter Swan (Liam Neeson) plays a game with his crew know as ""The Dead Pool"", wherein they each choose a set of ten celebrities who they think will die before the game ends. The winner is the one with most number of dead celebrities. The problems start when the people on Swan's list start to die under mysterious circumstances. Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is assigned to the case and discovers he is one of the names on Swan's list.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> Rock singer Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey), who is also a drug addict, is found dead of an overdose, but there are signs that it was not accidental, so Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is assigned to investigate. Initially, Harry locks horns with Peter Swan (Liam Neeson), the man who directs the singer's videos. He also crosses paths with television reporter Samantha Walker (Patricia Clarkson), and after being threatened with a law suit, the two of them form a rapport. Harry then discovers that Swan and several other people are playing a game called ""The Dead Pool"", wherein they make a list of individuals, who are either in bad health or high risk professions, and turns out that Squares was on Swan's list and so are some other people who were murdered, and Harry's also on the list. And someone is following him.—rcs0411@yahoo.com For San Francisco veteran police detective 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), fame catches up with him when he testifies against crime kingpin Lou Janero (Anthony Charnota) which puts Janero into prison. One night, Callahan is attacked by Janero's men at a turnoff near the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge while driving his car. However, he knocks down one of the assassins with his car and shoots the remaining men dead before they finish their jobs. Afterward, Dirty Harry Callahan and his new Asian-American, martial arts-skilled partner Al Quan (Evan C. Kim) are assigned to investigate the death of rock singer Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey). The head of public relations in the department believes that Callahan's image will be improved if he's partnered with an Asian-American.After slasher film director Peter Swan's (Liam Neeson) producer is killed in a Chinatown restaurant robbery which Callahan foils, Callahan discovers that he, together with Johnny Squares are part of a game in which participants try to predict the most celebrity deaths, presumably from natural causes or from those that work in dangerous professions, and in a turn of events, two more celebrities on the list are killed.Consequently, Harry has to deal with the media, particularly reporter Samantha Walker (Patricia Clarkson), to balance their interference with the investigation against the public's right to know. She also proposes to do an in-depth profile on Callahan for her news report, while he wants to simply perform his job and stay out of the limelight. After one dinner meeting, they narrowly escape being killed by Janero's men in an elevator outside a restaurant, leading the reporter to reconsider the plight of police officers.The following morning, Callahan drives to the prison where Janero is serving his sentence to meet with a chain-smoking, hulking inmate named Butcher Hicks. Callahan promises Hicks a carton of Camel cigarettes if he helps Callahan out. When Callahan reaches Janero's cell, he makes it clear to Janero that if something happens to him, then Butcher will pay him a visit and probably kill him (this results in Janero telling his men to make sure nothing happens to Callahan while he is on duty, even sending some bodyguards out to keep an eye on Callahan.)Callahan helps resolve a situation where a man named Gus Wheeler (Louis Giambalvo), who is rumored to be responsible for the murders, tries to burn himself to get on the news so people will know the real him. In the end, it turns out that the real killer is a deranged former employee of Swan's, named Harlan Rook (David Hunt) who thinks all of his ideas and work have been stolen by Swan. It is also known that Swan had filed a restraining order against Rook a year before.Next morning, Callahan and Quan are pursued through San Francisco's hilly streets in an unmarked squad car by a remote controlled bomb assembled by Rook, disguised as a radio controlled Corvette. The bomb explodes, nearly killing Quan who survives due to his bulletproof vest. Meanwhile, Rook, disguised as Swan, calls Walker at the television station to Swan's film studio to give her an interview, which is actually a trap. Soon after, Rook's home is raided by the police and torn posters of Swan's films are found.Callahan then drives to Swan's film studio near the waterfront where Walker is held captive by Rook. Callahan reluctantly surrenders his .44 Magnum revolver to Rook when he nearly slits her throat. Walker and Callahan escape and Callahan lures him to a pier after a chase. Rook, who has run out of bullets, is shot by Callahan with a harpoon, killing him instantly.As the film ends, Walker and Callahan are leaving the pier, while the police arrive at the scene."

Dangerous Liaisons,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A scheming widow and her manipulative ex-lover make a bet regarding the corruption of a recently married woman. In 18th century France, the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont play a dangerous game of seduction. Valmont is someone who measures success by the number of his conquests and Merteuil challenges him to seduce the soon to be married Cecile de Volanges and provide proof in writing of his success. His reward for doing so will be to spend the night with Merteuil. He has little difficulty seducing Cecile but what he really wants is to seduce Madame de Tourvel. When Merteuil learns that he has actually fallen in love with her, she refuses to let him claim his reward for seducing Cecile. Death soon follows.—garykmcd Eighteenth century France. Former lovers, the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont, who are among the Paris aristocracy, take pleasure in their games of sexual manipulation. While Valmont, who is renowned as a rakish playboy, does it to prove to himself that he can have any woman he wants with love never in the equation, Merteuil does it in an effort to level the playing field between the sexes in their class, while truly enjoying the cruelty of it all. No person is immune as collateral damage in their end goals. In order to get back at Bastide, the first and only man to have ever jilted her, Merteuil wants Valmont to deflower Bastide's intended, the innocent Cécile de Volanges, Merteuil's niece who spent her teenaged years in a convent and whose mother has just released her in order for her to enter into womanhood with Bastide, about which she is unaware. Bastide would only find out about Cécile not being a virgin on their wedding night. Merteuil offers herself sexually to Valmont as a reward. Valmont, however, declines as it would be too unchallenging a task, and as he has his eyes set on another conquest, namely Madame de Tourvel, a highly virtuous married woman who is staying temporarily with Valmont's aunt, Madame de Rosemonde, at her country château. Valmont's goal is not only to sleep with Madame de Tourvel, but to get her truly to want him. As such, Merteuil decides to enlist the unwitting help of the Chevalier Danceny, a poor music teacher, in her game, she planning to maneuver Danceny and Cécile into a relationship, which in reality could never happen due to their differing social classes. Danceny taking Cécile's virginity would be a bonus as the shame to Bastide would be greater than if Valmont did so. As Valmont's own set quest is a greater challenge, Merteuil does still offer herself to him if he succeeds in seducing Madame de Tourvel. As Merteuil and Valmont spend time with this collective group in their games of sexual manipulation, they may find that their modus operandi may be forever changed, but each for different reasons.—Huggo Set in France around 1760, the Marquise de Merteuil needs a favour from her ex-lover, Vicomte de Valmont. One of the Marquise de Merteuil's ex-lovers, Gercourt, is betrothed to a young, virtuous, woman called Cecile de Volanges. The Marquise would like Valmont to seduce Cecile before her wedding day, thus humiliating Gercourt. Meanwhile, Valmont has a conquest of his own in mind: Madame de Tourvel, a beautiful, married, and God fearing woman. The Marquise doesn't think that Valmont can seduce Mme de Tourvel. She tells him that if he can provide written proof of a sexual encounter with Mme de Tourvel, she will offer him a reward: one last night with her. Valmont, however, will find himself falling in love with Mme de Tourvel, and facing the deadly jealousy of the Marquise de Merteuil. All along, Cecile de Volanges is used as a pawn in this game of sexual conquest and scorned love.—<bennettc@kwanza.com> In pre-Revolution Paris, the Marquise de Merteuil (Glenn Close) plots revenge against her ex-lover, the Comte de Gercourt, who has recently ended their relationship. An amoral, sexually ravenous schemer, Merteuil amuses herself by manipulating men out of boredom, and her resentment of the subservient status of women in 18th-century French aristocratic society. To soothe her wounded pride and embarrass Gercourt, she seeks to arrange the seduction and disgrace of his young 18-year-old virgin fiancée, Cécile de Volanges (Uma Thurman), who has only recently been presented to society after spending her formative years in the shelter of a convent.Merteuil calls on her old friend, the rakish and similarly unprincipled Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) to do the deed, offering him her own sexual favors as the reward for a successful conquest. Valmont declines, claiming that it is too easy, plus he has a seduction of his own in progress: Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), the virtuous wife of a member of Parliament. Merteuil is amused and incredulous at Valmont's hubris. She asks him how can he ever hope to bed a chaste, devoutly religious woman like Madame Tourvel. Never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont modifies the proposal: If he succeeds in sleeping with Tourvel, Merteuil must sleep with him as well. Merteuil accepts, on the condition that he furnish written proof of the liaison.At the estate of Valmont's aunt in the countryside, Madame de Rosemonde (Mildred Natwick), where Tourvel is living as a guest while her husband is away on state business, Valmont employs every trick in his considerable repertoire in a vain attempt to attract Tourvel's attention. His first attempt to proposition to Tourvel fails when she refuses his advances. She reveals that she knows all about him and his reputation; that he seduces and corrupts young women for his own twisted enjoyment. Tourvel claims that a friend has been writing her letters which explains all about Valmont's seduction tactics.Searching for leverage, Valmont instructs his page Azolan (Peter Capaldi) to seduce Tourvel's maid Julie (Valerie Gogan) so that Valmont can intimidate her to gain access to Tourvel's private correspondence. Later, Julie gives one of the letters and it is from Madame de Volanges (Swoosie Kurtz), Cécile's mother and Merteuil's cousin, warning Tourvel that Valmont is a cad, and a generally nefarious and untrustworthy individual. On reading this, Valmont returns to Paris and resolves to do Merteuil's dirty work after all, seducing Cécile as revenge for her mother's only-too-accurate denunciation of him.Meanwhile, Cécile meets the charming Chevalier Raphael Danceny (Keanu Reeves) at a local opera house where she frequents. Danceny becomes Cécile's music teacher and slowly, with a little coaxing from Merteuil (who knows that Danceny, a poor commoner, can never qualify as a bona fide suitor), they fall in love.Valmont's connived seduction of Cécile is rapid and unsubtle. After gaining access to her bedchamber on a false pretense, he forces himself upon her as she pleads with him to leave. The following night he attempts to enter her room again, but she has barred her door. On the pretext of illness she remains locked in her chambers, refusing all visitors. A concerned Madame de Volanges calls upon Merteuil to speak to her. Cécile, naively assuming that Merteuil has her best interests at heart, confides in her. Merteuil advises Cécile to welcome Valmont's advances; young women should take advantage of all the lovers they can acquire, she says, in a society so repressive and contemptuous of women. The result is a perverse ""student-teacher"" relationship between Cécile and Valmont; by day she is courted by Danceny, and each night she receives a sexual ""lesson"" from Valmont. In the meantime, Merteuil seduces Danceny and begins an affair with him.Ever mindful of Merteuil's challenge, Valmont's principal target remains Madame de Tourvel, and during his time as Cécile's ""teacher"" he somehow manages to win Tourvel's heart..... but at a cost: Valmont, the lifelong bachelor playboy, falls in love, after spending his first night with Tourvel. In a fit of jealousy, Merteuil mocks Valmont for having succumbed to Tourvel's charms. She also refuses to honor her end of their agreement, since Valmont has no written proof that the relationship has been consummated. Valmont, faced with Merteuil's threat to trash his reputation by revealing himself as a carefree gigolo, abruptly dismisses Tourvel with a terse excuse: ""It is beyond my control"". Cécile, meanwhile, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's bed, miscarries his child.Tourvel, overwhelmed with grief and shame, retires to a convent where her health deteriorates inexorably, and she eventually dies from cholora. The Valmont-Merteuil toxicity/war escalates. Valmont learns of Merteuil's seduction of Danceny and warns him of her perfidy. Merteuil retaliates by informing Danceny that Valmont has been sleeping with Cécile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel, and mortally wounds him. On his deathbed, Valmont asks Danceny to communicate to Tourvel.... by now also at death's door.... his genuine love for her. He then gives Danceny his collection of intimate letters from MerteuilA few days later, all of Paris learns the entire, grisly range of her schemes and depredations. Booed and humiliated at the opéra by her former friends and sycophants, Merteuil flees the city in disgrace for places unknown. Cécile, guilt-ridden, returns to the convent whence she came to become a nun."

The younger agent trained in FBI school runs up against the small town ways of his former Sheriff partner.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> After three Civil Rights workers, who were organizing a voter registry clinic, go missing in Mississippi's Jessup County, the FBI deputes Agents Rupert Anderson and Alan Ward to investigate. After the duo encounter hostility at the hands of the county police and other males, more agents are brought in. This leads to a media frenzy, with Clayton Townley proclaiming openly that this community is an Anglo-Saxon democracy, an example of successful segregation that has been able to withstand the onslaught of integration, and total non-acceptance of Jews, Papists, Turks, Mongols, Orientals, Asians, and Negros. While differences crop up between investigative tactics of the two agents, the Ku Klux Klan, aided by the police, target the fearful African-Americans, brutally torturing them and setting their houses on fire. With the entire local community - both black and white - refusing to come forward with any information - the FBI must now consider using other methods to try and find out what really happened to the three workers.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) In 1964, three civil rights workers from the North disappear in a small Mississippi town and the FBI are sent to investigate. Agent in charge Alan Ward does everything by the book. Agent Rupert Anderson however was a Sheriff in Mississippi before joining the FBI and understands the local culture. He's also prepared to bend the rules a bit if it will help in the investigation. They focus on the Sheriff's office and Deputy Clinton Pell in particular as they think he may be the weakest link in the conspiracy. As the investigation intensifies however, the KKK launch a series of attacks against the local African-American population. With no one on either side prepared to talk, Ward agrees to Anderson using his own unorthodox methods to learn what happened that night and who killed the three men.—garykmcd A scene opening at a public building showing segregation of races with a water fountain for blacks and one for whites and a wooden country church burning with Mahalia Jackson's ""Lead Me On"" playing introducing the audience to the ugly reality of life in the rural south for most blacks during the Jim Crow era, which is being brought to a close in this movie.Three young men, two whites and one black, are driving down a rural Mississippi road at twilight. They are James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, civil rights workers who in the summer of 1964 were working to get blacks voting rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Several vehicles tailgate them and one of them turns out to be a police car. An unseen police officer is supposedly going to issue a citation for speeding, but it turns out he and several KKK members murder the young men. Off screen, you hear gunshots of the men being murdered and the screen says ""Mississippi, 1964"".FBI agents Ward and Anderson are driving to the fictional Jessup County, Mississippi (Neshoba County in reality) to investigate the missing men. Ward is a young, rather uptight, clean-cut, college-educated, and by the book agent and Anderson is a middle-aged, rough around the edges, and former small town Mississippi sheriff who believes in more experienced means to investigate, since he knows how the law works and how people's mentality is in the south. Both are liberal, but still don't see eye to eye.The men arrive at the sheriff's department at the Jessup County courthouse and ask a young deputy to see the sheriff. The deputy blows them off and teases them, but the sheriff comes out of his office soon afterwards, He is a chubby, jovial, tobacco chewing, and generally personable man that accepts their invitation and into the office to talk. Initially he thinks they are there to solve racial problems under the direction of Martin Luther King.Back in the car, Anderson and Ward are reviewing the sheriff's testimony to them about the three civil rights workers arrested for speeding, then released and escorted as far as the county line, never to be seen again. Ward is suspicious because the men are trained activists that are supposed to phone their headquarters every hour and that they did not do so after being released from jail or after their escort.Anderson and Ward go into a crowded restaurant to have lunch that is segregated and Ward, not taking seriously the rules and customs of segregation, goes into the black section to question a young man eating lunch. The man refuses to comply and the whites at the front of the restaurant all stop eating and stare at them.Anderson and Ward are at the remains of a black church in the countryside that was burned down where voter registration headquarters were being set up. The klan torched the place before anything could be done and the three missing men came back to apologize for what happened and talked to some locals. Ward wants to talk to some of them, but Anderson insists he's wasting his time that blacks refuse to do so in fear of retaliation, but Ward insists it's ""bureau procedure"". Ward questions an elderly black woman in a shack with her bedridden husband and the woman just answers yes sir and no sir to the questions he has about the incident of the burning.At a house of a black family, three menacing white men knock on the door and a young boy answers it with the men asking to see the brother. He is the young black man at the restaurant that refused to talk to Ward. The two white men beat him mercilessly that he better not talk to the FBI agents.Anderson and Ward are in their hotel room with Anderson going through the files of the missing young men. Ward does not understand where all the hatred of blacks is coming from. Anderson tells Ward a story of a black man that lived near his place when he was a kid that owned a mule that was later poisoned and the black man packed up and left. His father was a self-hating racist that had done it without any objection and taught his son that blacks will never be better than whites. Immediately afterwards, a shotgun blasts their window and there is a burning cross on the hotel property. Ward insists on more FBI agents being sent over, but Anderson objects to it thinking it will just cause more trouble.Ward, Anderson, and numerous FBI agents set up an office at a local movie theater to rent for only $75 a month. At the same time, a Cadillac with a Confederate flag is pulling up at another building nearby and Anderson is sure it's the Grand Wizard of the KKK. Ward goes to do a license plate check on who the car belongs to. Anderson goes about his less traditional means to infiltrate and find out information. He goes into the local barber shop with the sheriff there. The town mayor is receiving a shave and introduces himself to Anderson that outsiders need to just let people live their lives in their community and not stir up trouble. The sheriff insists their community is peaceful and if the FBI agents continue to push them, there will be dead bodies. Anderson blows them off passive-aggressively that nobody is bold enough to stand up to the racism and that they are just there for a missing person's case.Agent Bird is another FBI agent that comes to Ward and tells him the license plate does indeed belong to Clayton Townley, Grand Wizard of the KKK. And that a Choctaw Indian on a nearby reservation believes he found the car the three missing civil rights workers were in.Anderson now goes into the local beauty shop flirting with the ladies that he wants a new hair job, then inquires who that vehicle belongs to and the local operator Mrs. Pell, states it belongs to Clayton Townley. Anderson confesses he's an FBI agent and Mrs. Pell is the deputy's wife. After questioning, a car squeals on the street and dumps a young black man out of it. He is the young black man at the diner that Ward tried to question. The sheriff tells the agents to back off and for he and his staff to handle the situation. Anderson reprimands Ward for speaking to a black man with a white audience and that this is what happens. They both already know Clayton Townley is the man who pulled up in the car, and Ward explains to Anderson about the vehicle at the Choctaw reservation.A Choctaw Indian man is filleting catfish and shows the FBI agents the vehicle. About a dozen of them all walk through the swamp in their nice suits and find it. A tow truck pulls the car out of the swamp. Anderson and Ward now realize they never left the state. Ward orders Bird to telephone asking for 100 men to search the swamp for the bodies. Once again, Anderson disagrees thinking it will just cause more trouble.Over 100 Naval Reserve men have been activated to come search the swamp. During this time, black homes and churches are bombed and set on fire by klansmen and there is national media coverage with many white locals thinking the whole thing is a hoax set up by the FBI.The media are interviewing Sheriff Stuckey, and he insists the FBI are wasting their time searching for the three men and think the whole thing is a set up by the NAACP.Ward and Anderson are back at the site where the black church was burned, and a young black boy, Aaron is talking to a group of people about how the day will come that they will no longer have to kiss ass with the sheriff or any other powers that be. The other people leave, but Aaron and his father remain with Ward attempting to ask them questions. Anderson tries to as well, but Aaron speaks back at him that he knows there will be retaliation if they say anything and that they are not the law there and should be just as scared as they are.Ward and Anderson go to Deputy Pell's home while he is on break from work eating dinner and watching a baseball game. The deputy is annoyed at them coming there, but Ward questions him about the night the three men were missing and Anderson converses with Mrs. Pell in the kitchen with her telling him the house they are in is where she was born and raised and about the hours her husband works. Afterwards, Ward and Anderson leave with Ward worried about Pell's confidence in the matter and that Anderson saw a wedding photo of the Pell couple with three men with the KKK symbol in the picture.Anderson and Ward secretly spy on Pell escorting a drunk out of jail with Anderson using this as an opportunity to interview Mrs. Pell.Anderson goes back to the Pell residence to question her brushing off Ward's college boy book smarts, gives her pretty flowers that smell bad, and she offers him iced tea while they talk. He tells her about his life growing up in Mississippi himself, hanging onto an unsuccessful marriage while working as an FBI agent, and questions her about Deputy Pell's alibi about 50 minutes he spent with her on the fateful night, but she answers a reluctant yes and he decides to leave.At a black church, many locals have gathered from churches that have been burned down. A large group of klansmen are waiting outside the church to beat the people and run in horror after having seen them. Aaron is in that group, gets down on his knees to pray, and a klansman attacks him threatening to kill him if he talks to FBI agents again.Back to the site of the swamp being searched, white locals are being interviewed by the press, some thinking blacks are treated badly and others thinking there's nothing wrong with the way they're being treated. The klansmen are teasing people searching the swamps for wanting to find the bodies.Back in town, the media are interviewing Clayton Townley. He's asked if he's with the KKK, but Townley insists he's a businessman and why people that are not white, Anglo-Saxon Christians are not accepted, among them including Jews, Catholics, Tartars, Mongols, Orientals, and Negroes.Anderson goes into a local club that serves beer, even though he's in a dry state and attempts conversation with the men. Among them are Deputy Pell and several other men. Pell gives him a Falstaff beer to drink. He tells them of his days with bootlegged alcohol on his payroll and his days as a Mississippi sheriff, but they pay him no mind, and Pell cuts him off and tells him they're not interested in his stories. Frank Bailey, a klansman who was seen at the beginning of the movie harassing and possibly killing the three missing civil rights workers, grabs and threatens Anderson that he and the staff of FBI are wasting their time trying to investigate and change things and that they need to leave unless they want more dead bodies. Anderson puts Frank in his place grabbing him by the genitals that they will not leave until the job is done. He thanks Pell for the beer and leaves.Anderson is back at the makeshift FBI headquarters at the movie theater with a documentary about a klansman objecting to integration. Ward reprimands Anderson for his intimidation tactics and talking to the deputy's wife about the incident. Anderson is furious, but Ward reminds him that opening a can of worms happens on the inside.There is a street protest in town with mostly blacks and some white participation. Anderson goes back into the beauty parlor with Mrs. Pell upset at the protest she sees outside.Anderson and Ward stake out the sheriff's department on a young black man that's just been released from jail. Some klansmen pick him up in a truck afterwards with Anderson and Ward on their tail.

The mayor decides to comply.The black man gets inside a small commuter airplane on a farm and takes off in a rainstorm. He is revealed to be a ""specialist"" by the FBI from Agent Anderson.

Now Andy must fight for his life or die.—Oscar Segarra For his sixth birthday, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) asks his mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks) to buy him a Good Guys doll that he wants. When a peddler has one for a good price, Karen buys the doll, not knowing that it is possessed by the ghost of the infamous murderer, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), who had used voodoo to imprison his spirit in the doll when he was gunned down so he could continue to murder people. When Andy is being babysat by his Aunt Maggie (Dinah Manoff), Charles Lee Ray, who is in a doll called 'Chucky,' feels the urge to kill someone and pushes Maggie from the kitchen window of the Barclays' fifth-floor apartment, thus letting his little secret slip out to Andy. After the police are called, Homicide Officer Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), who, coincidentally happens to be the cop that shot Charles Lee Ray, comes to investigate the crime. When Andy tries to tell the adults that Chucky is the killer, they think he's mentally ill and want him institutionalized. When Karen finds out the truth about Chucky, she tries to tell Officer Norris that Andy isn't crazy, but Norris thinks she's being ridiculous and is demented as well.

Charles shoots off the lock and enters a toy store. Mike lands another shot on Charles. Charles realizes he is dying. Before he dies, he grabs a Good Guy Doll and does a strange chant. Dark clouds appear, lightning strikes and the toy store blows up. The only thing left for Mike to find is Charles's dead body, lying next to a Good Guy Doll.Andy sees a commercial for the Good Guy Doll on TV. Unfortunately, there is no Good Guy Doll inside the large present, just a bunch of clothes. Andy's mother Karen didn't know about the doll in time to save up for it. Maggie comes up with a solution. There is a peddler in an alley who sells a Good Guy Doll to Karen for fifty dollars. At the workplace, Karen's boss says Mrs Howe has taken sick. Karen has to work overtime and fill her place. Maggie says she will babysit Andy. Andy is filled with joy, having finally received his Good Guy Doll. The doll introduces itself: ""Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend 'til the end. Hidey ho, ha ha ha.""Maggie says it's time for bed. Andy says that Chucky wants to watch the nine o'clock news, but Maggie says it's time for bed. Maggie finds the TV turned back on and Chucky sitting in front of it. She tucks Andy in bed with Chucky. Maggie thinks the noise coming from down the hallway is Andy. She finds a jar of spilled flour on the floor. She goes to clean it up and gets a hammer to the face. She stumbles backwards, crashes through the window and falls to her death. There are shoe prints in the flour. Mike Norris looks at the soles of Andy's shoes. They're the same design. Karen says that Andy doesn't know how the footprints got there. Mike says somebody made those footprints. If it's not Andy, then who? Andy finds that Chucky has flour on the bottom of his shoes. Mike and Karen don't believe Andy about Chucky being the killer. Karen finds Andy talking to Chucky. ""His real name is Charles Lee Ray. He says that Maggie was a real bitch and got what she deserved.""The next day, Andy takes Chucky to school with him. When Karen is out of sight, Andy leaves the school and walks in the other direction. He rides on a train to the house where Eddie Caputo is hiding. He puts Chucky in a chair and leaves to take a piss. Chucky in the first-person point of view enters the house, opens the oven and turns on the gas. Eddie is awoken by the noise. He approaches the kitchen door, opens the door and shoots. The house blows up. In the police station, Karen tells Andy that if he doesn't start telling the truth, they're going to take him away from her. Andy tries to get Chucky to say something. Chucky doesn't seem to say anything but Andy seems to understand him. ""He told me never to tell about him or he'd kill me.""Doctor Ardmore says he's seen more than enough. Maybe Andy should spend a few days with them. Back in the apartment, Karen is now wanting Chucky to say something. She picks up the box. The batteries fall out. The toy's batteries were still in the box. She opens the doll's battery compartment. It's empty. The head spins around and says ""Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?"" She drops the doll in fright. She threatens to throw the doll in the fire if it does not talk. And it does talk: ""You stupid bitch! You filthy slut! I'll teach you to fuck with me!"" Chucky bites her arm. She throws him off. Chucky runs off. There is an elevator going down. Karen takes the stairs. By the time she gets to the ground floor and out the front door, Chucky is nowhere to be seen. Karen runs to Mike Norris, but even the bite mark on her arm won't convince him that Andy was telling the truth. Karen is off to find the peddler who sold her the doll. Mike says: ""That isn't a good part of town to be in at this time of night.""Karen finds the peddler and asks where he got the doll from. The peddler asks: ""What will you give me if I tell you?"" Karen hands over her money. The peddler says: ""It's not enough.""Karen says it's all she has. The peddler says: ""You got a lot."" He gets ready to get dirty with Karen. Mike arrives. He waves his gun around to scare away the other people. Some rough handling gets the peddler to talk. He found the doll at a burned down toy store at Wabash. Mike says: ""Charles Lee Ray died there.""Mike is inside his car. Chucky strangles Mike with a cord. Mike loses control of the car. He grabs the car's cigarette lighter and burns Chucky in the face with it. Chucky is stabbing through the back of the seat. The car is flipped upside down. Chucky says that Mike can't hurt him. When Mike lands a shot on Chucky, it actually does hurt him. The bullet wound bleeds too. Chucky visits John Bishop to find out what's going on. John explains that Chucky is turning human. The more time he spends inside this doll, the more human he becomes. Chucky asks for a way out of this. At first, John refuses, ""You're an abomination. An outrage against nature. You perverted everything I've taught you and use it for evil. And you have to be stopped.""Chucky thought something like this might happen. He plays with a voodoo doll of John. He breaks his arm and his leg. John says that Chucky needs to transfer his soul into the first person who he told he was alive, which happens to be Andy. Chucky thanks John and stabs the voodoo doll in the heart. Mike and Karen arrive. John stays alive long enough to tell them about Chucky's plan to transfer his soul into Andy. He says Chucky's heart is almost human. The only way to kill Chucky is through the heart. With that, John dies.Chucky arrives at the mental institution. He finds the keys and unlocks the door. He pulls off the bed covers to find a pillow underneath. Andy runs out of the room. Doctor Ardmore grabs hold of Andy and tries to inject him with something to sedate him. Chucky picks up a scalpel and stabs the doctor in the back of the leg. The doctor falls to the floor. Chucky sticks an electric band on the doctor's head and turns up the voltage.

Macon was desperate as his regular animal shelter had refused to take in Edward due to his biting habit) and dog trainer with a sickly son Alexander Pritchett (Robert Hy Gorman) (Alexander is allergic to many many things and is almost always at the doctor's).

Waking up in the middle of the night Macon decides to call Muriel but his telephone malfunctions. Macon gets up and while trying to fix the cord, hurts his back and becomes bedridden.

The Accused,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094608/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a young woman suffers a brutal gang rape in a bar one night, a prosecutor assists in bringing the perpetrators to justice, including the ones who encouraged and cheered on the attack. Sarah Tobias goes to her local bar and is gang-raped by three men. The district attorney on the case is Katheryn Murphy who wants to prove that although Sarah had taken drugs that night and was acting provocatively while in the bar, this is no reason for her to be so brutally attacked and the men responsible should be brought to justice.—Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> This movie is based on actual events. Sarah Tobias goes into a bar one night and winds up being gang raped by 3 guys. She is introduced to an attorney named Katherine Murphy. Not only does Katherine Murphy want to go after the men who commited the rape, she wants to go after the men in the bar who cheered it on. But Katherine has her work cut out for her. Her client has a past, and that past could be used against her in court.—<kbouck@primenet.com> The Accused (1988)The controversial rape-themed drama The Accused opens with an exterior shot of a bar, The Mill, located somewhere along the highways of Washington. Ominous music plays as the sky turns to black. A young man named Kenneth Joyce (Bernie Coulson) appears rushing outside of the bar. Before long, the wailing screams of young Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster) are heard as she makes her way out of the bar. Apparently, she has suffered a prolonged gang rape at the hands of three men in a crowded room. Kenneth informs of this to the police as Sarah becomes rescued on the highway.At the hospital, she meets up with several professionals, including Carol Hunnicutt (Linda Darlow) from the Rape Crisis Center, whilst being examined by doctors. It is learned that Sarah was intoxicated at the time of the incident. Finally, she meets Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis), her Deputy District Attorney and Lieutenant Duncan (Terry David Mulligan), who's in charge of the police investigation.With the bar still open, Sarah manages to point out two of her assailants to the police. There is Kurt (Kim Kondrashoff), a formidable presence wearing a yellow t-shirt, and local man Danny (Woody Brown).Kathryn drives Sarah home. She lives in a trailer home with her live-in boyfriend, drug dealer and would-be musician Larry (Tom O'Brien). She also has a dog named Sadie (named after The Beatles song ""Sexy Sadie"").After the police arrest the third suspect, a fraternity man named Bob Joiner (Steve Antin), the three rapists are released to their community on $10,000.00 bail. It turns out, Bob is a best friend of the much-chagrined Kenneth. Sarah, a waitress, hears of the news. At home, she is visited by Kathryn. Kathryn is unimpressed by Sarah's behavior as she had dressed provocatively that night at the bar and was also drinking heavily and showing a lot of cleavage. It is further revealed that Sarah had a record for drug possession. Denying this, Sarah demands that justice be done to her attackers.Kathryn goes on to interview some of the witnesses or onlookers to the scene. These include Sarah's best friend Sally Fraser (Ann Hearn), who was waitressing at The Mill the night Sarah was assaulted. They find Polito (Stephen E. Miller), a bar patron who saw what happened but proves useless for having been drunk and on probation during the events that night. After Kathryn makes a deal with the rapists' lawyers, the three men are sentenced to reckless endangerment (2 ½-5 years in prison).In a fit of rage, the betrayed Sarah storms in Kathryn's dinner party and confronts Kathryn over the relatively light sentences imposed on her attackers. It is believed Sarah would not have made a strong witness to the state. However, she goes on to emphasize the seriousness of the matter. While she was being gang-raped on a pinball machine, a crowd of men were ""yelling and clapping"".Back at home, Sarah cuts her hair. In the livingroom, Larry tries to seduce her, but she refuses. Enraged by Larry's lack of empathy and understanding of the potentially damaging, psychological or otherwise, effects rape has on her, Sarah orders Larry to leave her house permanently.The next day begins as Sarah unwittingly finds herself in a record store with Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrect (Leo Rossi), who taunts her with macho advances before revealing himself as one of the spectators to the rape. She tries to escape from the parking lot, but he obstructs her with his truck and harasses her. ""You wanna play pinball?"", he laughs. In a state of madness, Sarah decides to retaliate by ramming his truck. Before she could finish the job, she and Cliff both end up in the hospital with minor head injuries.Feeling guilt-ridden over not having offered Sarah a choice of testifying before agreeing to the deal, Kathryn is determined to prosecute the spectators for criminal solicitation. Thus, the rape would go on record and the rapists will stay in jail for the full 5 years. But her colleagues, especially D.A. Paul Rudolph (Carmen Argenziano), feel she has lost her mind and offer her little support. However, she receives much help along the way from Sarah and Sally, who identifies the three spectators in a lineup. They are Matthew Haines (Andrew Kavadas), Stu Holloway (Tom McBeath), and the aforementioned Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrect.Meanwhile, both Sarah and Sally meet up with Kathryn at her office. Sally is interviewed by Kathryn. It's discovered that Sarah had flirted heavily with Bob, one of the rapists, perhaps in an effort to get back at her cheating boyfriend. Hearing this, Kathryn decides it's best that Sally doesn't testify on Sarah's behalf. A thwarted Sarah leaves Kathryn's office.Fortunately enough, Kathryn eventually finds Kenneth at a university. Kenneth is reluctant to testify. Though not denying the behavior of the rapists, including his best friend, he maintains that the spectators weren't to blame. ""It was like a show. They watched. Big deal"", says Kenneth. He finally agrees to testify after Kathryn plays his recorded message.At the courthouse, Sarah gives a highly detailed, lengthy account of the night of the rape at The Mill. However, she is unable to ascertain who ""applauded or shouted"" or to prove that anyone in the bar really saw her struggling. The witness is excused.After visiting his friend Bob, Kenneth enters the courthouse. Though aware of the consequences facing Bob, Kenneth recounts what happened that night in a scene structured in flashbacks. In the flashback sequence, the sexily-dressed Sarah enters The Mill. She catches the eye of Danny and Bob, who's seated with Kenneth. Danny meets Sarah, and then accompanies her to the game room. They both play pinball with Bob and pretty soon find themselves dancing to the music playing on the jukebox. Danny embraces her ""tight close"". At this point, she tries to fight him off as he's coming on a bit strongly. Totally relentless, Danny throws her on top of the pinball machine and forces himself on her. In the process, Kurt has her arms pinned down and the near-sadistic spectators begin chanting ""make her moan"" and ""stick it to her"". Bob proceeds to rape her, followed by Kurt. As Kurt rapes her, the spectators repeatedly chant ""One...two...three...four. Poke that pussy 'til it's sore"". The scene ends with both Kenneth and Sarah storming out of the bar in disgust.Much debate is made on the charges laid against the spectators. As Attorney Paulsen (Peter Van Norden) points out, Sarah has been unable to acknowledge the spectators' responsibility. He firmly believes Kenneth is guilty for having watched a rape without taking action. ""He was offered a way to purge that guilt, and he took it"". Kathryn argues against this. As she states, ""It is not the crime of criminal solicitation to silently watch a rape.

Sidney Poitier returned to the big screen in this action-thriller, after a decade-long absence. When a cunning murderer vanishes into the rugged mountains of the Pacific Northwest, pursuing FBI agent Warren Stantin (Poitier) must exchange familiar city streets for unknown wilderness trails. Completely out of his element, Stantin is forced to enlist the aid of expert tracker Jonathan Knox (PLATOON'S Tom Berenger). The killer has infiltrated a guided hiking trip led by Knox's girlfriend Sarah (Kirstie Alley, at the height of her Cheers fame). Viewers don't know which of the hikers is the killer, and the tension lasts well into the movie.—Donny Dollar The film opens with a man entering the fine jewelry store he owns in Seattle. He frantically gathers up a consignment of diamonds and is arrested when the security alarm in the store goes off. He tells the police he needs to take the diamonds back to his house where his wife is being held hostage. As the police surround his house, the criminal inside demands to go free. To make his point, the criminal lets the housekeeper free, only to shoot her in the back, killing her. He exits the house with the store owner's wife, however they are both covered in a bed comforter, preventing police snipers from killing him or the woman. The police, lead by FBI agent Warren Stantin, follow the man and his hostage to the waterfront where he boards a boat. The wife is shot dead and the killer escapes with the diamonds.Stantin later receives a tip that the killer may have retreated to the mountains that boarder Washington State and British Columbia, with the intention of crossing the border to escape. A hiking party has chartered the services of a woman named Sarah, an expert guide in the region and the killer has joined them. Stantin hires Sarah's boyfriend, John Knox, to follow them. Knox, a fiercely independent and private man, is also an expert guide and tracker. At first he resists Stantin's attempts to hire him but later agrees. Knox helps Stantin gear up for the hike and warns him that they'll be crossing heavy terrain and he thinks Stantin won't be able to keep up.As Stantin and Knox slowly catch up with Sarah's party, one of them, Norm, slips and falls off a ridge. As the killer, whose name is Steve, tries to help him up, his pistol falls into a crevice where he can't retrieve it. He has Norm hand it back to him and then lets go of his arm, letting him plummet into the canyon. When the rest of the party backtracks and sees what happened, Steve throws some of them over the cliff and forces the last man, Harvey, backward until he too falls. Sarah is horrified and panics, however, Steve quickly takes control and tells her to lead him to the Canadian border. Sarah reluctantly agrees and leads him further into the mountains but deliberately taking the longer route.Stantin and Knox follow about a day behind and come to the ravine Sarah's party had crossed on a cabled basket. Right before they continued, Steve had cut the rope to retrieve the basket and had wedged the basket on the far side. Knox ties a rope to himself and crawls hand-over-hand on the cable to get the basket but it comes loose and knocks him off. Stantin is barely able to pull him up.Further on, Sarah and Steve have holed up in a cabin on the trail. After binding Sarah's hands to an overhead beam, Steve uses their two-way radio to contact Sarah's base camp. They inform her that a powerful snowstorm is headed their way and they should stay put. They also inform Sarah that one of her party is a criminal wanted by the FBI.Right before the storm hits, Knox and Stantin find themselves at the base of a chimney rock. Knox sets up a tent in the crevice for Stantin to shelter in during the storm and continues up the chimney himself, telling Stantin to stay in the tent during the storm and return to the base camp afterward. Stantin refuses and tries to climb up Knox's rope over Knox's objections. They hike further down the other side of the mountain when the storm hits. Stantin is overcome by the slashing wind and Knox orders them to stop and dig a shelter in the snow. They stay there until the storm passes, Knox using his body heat to keep Stantin from freezing.Sarah and Steve have resumed their trek. When Sarah fakes an injury and hits Steve with a branch, she runs. Steve fires a shot at her which is heard by Knox and Stantin. Steve easily catches Sarah again. Knox and Stantin run in Sarah's direction but are unable to catch them -- Sarah and Steve have reached a highway and jump in a logging truck when Steve flags it down. Knox falls to his knees in defeat.In Vancouver, BC, Stantin and Knox meet Stantin's agents and team up with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

It seems Santa hasn't got the magic for another Christmas season, and has come to Orlando, Florida for Joe Carruthers, the man he has chosen as his successor. But things quickly begin to unravel, thanks to Joe's meddling agent and Santa's increasingly unreliable memory. Incredibly, dimwitted Ernest soon becomes Santa's only hope!

Joe hosts a local children's TV program with emphasis on manners and integrity.While they are driving, a runaway teenage girl who says she is named Harmony Starr (Noelle Parker) joins Ernest and Santa in the cab. When they get to their destination, Santa possesses no legal currency (only play money), so in his giving Christmas spirit, Ernest lets him ride for free. The decision gets Ernest fired from his job. Ernest later discovers that Santa left his magic sack in the cab, and Ernest begins a quest to find the old man and return it to him.At the Orlando Children's Museum, Santa tries talking to Joe, but is rudely interrupted and rebuffed by Joe's agent Marty Brock.

He explains about passing the position of Santa Claus over to him because otherwise the magic will eventually die. Santa also explains that from Orlando, Joe must leave to deliver the presents by 7pm; if he leaves any later, he will run into daylight before he finishes.

She steals the sack, and attempts to run away again. On Christmas Eve, however, her conscience prevails, and she rushes back to find Ernest and Santa and return the sack.

Three years prior an alien craft crash-landed on Earth. The saucer housed 300,000 ""Newcomers"", an extraterrestrial race of hard labor workers. With no way to return to their home planet, the Newcomers were first quarantined and then finally released to live among humans in the LA area.An LA police detective, Matthew Sykes, and his partner, Detective Tuggle, are patrolling an LA Newcomer neighborhood when they spot two of the aliens dressed in long black coats entering a small convenience store. The aliens pull out shotguns and rob the store's owner. Sykes and Tuggle intervene when the robbers emerge from the store and a gunfight ensues. One of the newcomers changes the magazine on his shotgun and begins to fire several powerful rounds that pass through the entire width of the car Tuggle is hiding behind.

Sykes, enraged at his longtime partner's death, takes off after Tuggle's killers.Rushing into a dark tunnel near the store, the Newcomer Sykes chases pulls out a small vial of blue fluid and deposits a small amount on his tongue.

Sykes refuses to refer to his partner as ""Sam Francisco"" so he dubs him ""George.""The two go to the coroner's lab where they receive a report about the Newcomer store owner and the alien Sykes shot. While Sykes talks to the coroner, George talks to his Newcomer assistant in their native language. Evidence of a specific condition was found in the murderer but George doesn't share the information with Sykes.

On a stretch of ocean beach, Strader is being beaten by the henchmen of a Newcomer businessman, William Harcourt, while his assistant, Rudyard Kipling (himself one of the Newcomers involved in the convenience store holdup), looks on. When Strader won't accept a lucrative offer from Harcourt, Harcourt orders his men to take Strader out into the salt water, which has the same effect on the alien species that acid would on humans.Further investigation by the pair reveals that Strader was quarantined with Harcourt and two other Newcomers who were chemists. Sykes and George talk to the manager of a factory where Newcomers work in a room filled with methane gas without harm. After Sykes and George leave, the manager looks over a room behind protective glass where Newcomers are working with complex machinery to produce a blue fluid like the one the store robber took a dose of before Sykes killed him."

The Presidio,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095897/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A San Francisco civilian police detective is forced to work on a series of murders with his former enemy commanding officer while dating his daughter. Jay Austin is now a civilian police detective. Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell was his commanding officer several years before when he left the military police over a disagreement over the handling of a drunk driver. Now a series of murders that cross jurisdictions force them to work together again. That Austin is now dating Caldwell's daughter is not helping the relationship at all.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> At the Presidio, the Army base in San Francisco, a female M.P. was conducting her rounds when she came across the officer's club and the door had been forced open. She went to investigate and was shot. The individuals who broke in got into their car and drove off, and what followed was high speed chase that got both the Army M.P.s and the San Francisco police involved, which ended badly for both. Jay Austin, a San Francisco Police detective, is sent to investigate and he is met by Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell, who was his commanding officer, when he was an M.P. at the Presidio. It seems that Austin tried to arrest an Army officer, but didn't follow procedures, and Caldwell didn't support him, and the murdered M.P. was Austin's partner. A preliminary investigation casts suspicion on the officer Austin tried to arrest.—rcs0411@yahoo.com At the Presidio U.S. Army base in San Francisco, MP Patti Jean Lynch (Jenette Goldstein) is shot dead while investigating a break-in on the base and two San Francisco Police officers are killed as they chase the thieves through the hilly streets of San Francisco and their car crashes on a street downtown. Jay Austin (Mark Harmon), a San Francisco police inspector, is sent to investigate. He clashes with Lieutenant Colonel Alan Caldwell (Sean Connery), the base Provost Marshal.Years ago, Austin and Lynch were partners while serving as MPs at the Presidio and Caldwell was their commanding officer. When Austin arrested Colonel Paul Lawrence (Dana Gladstone), Caldwell didn't support him. In the aftermath, Austin was demoted and decided to leave the army. Austin and Caldwell share a mutual dislike for one another.The murder investigation casts suspicion on Lawrence, as Lynch was killed with a Tokarev, a Russian pistol. Lawrence is the registered owner of a Tokarev, but claims he lost it in a poker game. Austin also learns that the getaway car used by Lynch's killer was registered to a civilian named Arthur Peale (Mark Blum), who is wealthy and owns a holding company that, in turn, owns other companies.Austin tries to question Lawrence about the Tokarev, but Caldwell intervenes. Austin's suspicions are further fueled that Caldwell will do anything to protect a fellow officer from civilian authorities, even if he is a killer. Recognizing that part of the case is under Caldwell's jurisdiction at the Presidio and part is under Austin's jurisdiction in San Francisco, they uneasily team up to investigate the case. Caldwell states that if the Tokarev bullet that killed Lynch were to match a bullet fired earlier from Lawrence's Tokarev at the Presidio firing range, then Caldwell will arrange for Lawrence to surrender to Austin for arrest.In the meantime, Caldwell and Austin visit Peale, who claims his car was simply stolen and has an alibi for the night Lynch was shot. However, Caldwell notices Vietnam-era paraphernalia in Peale's office. Using his own contacts, Caldwell learns that Peale was previously in the CIA, and a spy and military advisor in Vietnam at the same time Lawrence was there as an officer. It becomes clear that Lawrence and Peale knew each other.Austin gets the ballistics report back on the Tokarev, which confirms that Lawrence's gun killed Lynch. Ignoring his agreement with Caldwell, Austin corners Lawrence when he leaves the Presidio, resulting in a lengthy footchase through San Francisco's Chinatown. Ultimately, Lawrence is killed in a hit and run by someone driving a blue-colored Pontiac Trans-Am. Caldwell meets him at the scene and is furious that Austin disregarded their agreement.Compounding their past tension, Caldwell is also upset that Austin has started a relationship with his daughter Donna (Meg Ryan). Their relationship is rocky, with Donna alternately teasing and pushing Austin away. Caldwell confides in his friend, retired Sergeant Major Ross Maclure (Jack Warden), who runs the Presidio's war museum. It is revealed in backstory that Caldwell was Maclure's lieutenant during the Vietnam War. Caldwell was very green and relied heavily on Maclure. In one sequence, we learn that Maclure saved an injured Caldwell and attacked a Vietcong platoon waiting to ambush American soldiers, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.Caldwell and Austin both figure out that the killer at the Presidio was trying to break into a storeroom to retrieve a bottle of spring water that was delivered earlier that day. Following that lead to the company which delivered the water, Austin gets the name of the driver who made the delivery, George Spota (James Hooks Reynolds). Caldwell recognizes the name as someone who served under Lawrence in Vietnam. Austin confirms that it was Spota's car that hit and killed Lawrence during their footchase; Spota's car is actually yellow but had recently been painted blue. Caldwell learns that the water company Spota works for is owned by Arthur Peale, thus confirming that Spota, Peale, and Lawrence were working together. Austin and Caldwell follow Spota during his daily water deliveries. Spota makes a delivery to Travis Air Force Base. Under surveillance by Austin and Caldwell, Spota picks up a bottle of water that was transported to the Air Force base from the Philippines.Austin and Caldwell follow Spota and the bottle of water back to the water company. Unsure what is in the water bottle that makes it so valuable, Austin and Caldwell see the edges of the conspiracy come together. Spota, Lawrence and Peale all knew each other in Vietnam. It appears that Spota picked up a delivery of water from the Philippines, but accidentally left that water bottle in the storeroom at the Presidio. When he realized his mistake, he went back to retrieve it. Lynch surprised him during the break-in and she was shot.Just as they figure the scope of the robbery and murder, they see Maclure drive up to the water company. With a terrible realization, Caldwell figures out that Peale and Lawrence would have needed someone like Maclure to carry out the smuggling, because Maclure had excellent contacts within the US military in Asia. Inside the water company, Spota and Peale open the water bottle that came from the Philippines, revealing that diamonds were smuggled inside--the diamonds being nearly invisible in the clear water. Maclure comes in and surprises them holding his own .45 pistol from the base museum. Peale reveals that Lawrence was blackmailing Maclure about something Maclure did while in Vietnam. Peale tries to convince Maclure to let the smuggling operation continue. But Maclure is disgusted with himself and heartbroken over the death of Lynch, whom he knew. He says the smuggling must stop, but then is stripped of his gun by Peale's men. Just as Peale is about to kill Maclure, Caldwell and Austin enter the water company to save him. A gun fight ensues, during which Peale and his men are killed, and Maclure is fatally wounded while trying to pass his pistol to Caldwell.Caldwell asks Austin to delay his police report by 48 hours to give Caldwell time to bury Maclure with his honor intact. Austin agrees and the final scene is at a military cemetery where Caldwell tearfully eulogizes Maclure. At the end of the film, Caldwell reconciles with Donna and grudgingly admits Austin into the family."
Tucker: The Man and His Dream,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096316/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Preston Tucker, the maverick car designer and his ill-fated challenge to the auto industry with his revolutionary car concept. Based on a true story. Shortly after World War II, Preston Tucker is a grandiose schemer with a new dream, to produce the best cars ever made. With the assistance of Abe Karatz and some impressive salesmanship on his own part, he obtains funding and begins to build his factory. The whole movie also has many parallels with director Coppola's own efforts to build a new movie studio of his own.—Reid Gagle A semi-fictionalized account of engineerPreston Tucker's quest to manufacture his revolutionary car of the future is told. The present in this case is WWII, his want being to supply what he will see being the pent up demand of the American consumer in the post-war era. His design takes into account many of the deficiencies he sees in what is being churned out by the Big Three car manufacturers. Beyond his inner circle of ardent supporters including his loving family who assist him in his dream out of his barn in rural Ypsilanti, Michigan, he hires Abe Karatz to help with the financing and administrative plans, Abe who admits that unlike Tucker's inner circle that he is doing this job for the money. While Abe eventually buys into the dream, they discover that much of the public also buys into that dream in Tucker's role of publicity in order to raise money. However, they will also discover that there are others internally who do only see dollar signs in doing things the way they've always been done by the Big Three. But what may be the biggest obstacle for Tucker and his group to succeed is the opposition by the Big Three, who see Tucker as a major threat to their way of life and who have some powerful people in their proverbial back pockets.—Huggo This is the story of entrepreneur Preston Tucker and the innovative car he designed in the late 1940s. The car was attractive, economical, and safe, and had many features not found on the cars of that time -- an air-cooled rear engine, disk brakes, independent 4-wheel suspension, an additional center headlight that pivoted left and right for better vision when turning, a padded dash, seatbelts, and a popout safety windshield. Tucker's promotional activities generated widespread public excitement and interest in the car, but the powerful auto industry blocked its production. Only 50 cars were ever made. The plan was to produce the car in the former Dodge B-29 engine plant on the far southwest side of Chicago. Many Chicagoans invested in the Tucker Motor Corporation, and some bought dealerships. Even today, many people believe that then-Senator Homer Ferguson (R-Michigan) is the person most responsible for the loss of their investment in the revolutionary ahead-of-its-time ""Tucker Torpedo""."

Can they wit stand the devil in human form?—ipreach4ever The film opens on October 30, 1988, nearly ten years after Michael Myers's last murderous rampage in Haddonfield, Illinois. An ambulance from Smith's Grove, IL makes its way along the road in a thunderstorm toward the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael, who has been in a coma since then, has been incarcerated. After the apprehensive transfer crew is seen off by medical chief of staff Dr. Hoffman, the ambulance makes its way up the driveway in the storm and back out onto the highway toward Smith's Grove. While in the ambulance, he hears that eight-year-old Jamie Lloyd, his niece and the daughter of Laurie Strode, his first target, is residing in Haddonfield. He immediately grabs and repeatedly bashes a hospital attendant's head against the wall of the ambulance and stabs his finger right into his skull. The other attendant, trapped by the ambulance's locked doors, can only watch helplessly. Soon after, the film introduces Jamie, who has been adopted by the Carruthers family and is still mourning the loss of her mother. Laurie supposedly died in a car accident eleven months earlier. Her older foster sister Rachel comes into her room and consoles her, telling her that she will love her just as much as her mother did. Rachel sends Jamie off to bed and exits the room. Jamie kneels down next to the bed and says her prayers when suddenly, lightning and thunder crash outside, startling her. The door creaks open and as Jamie gets up to close it, the reflection of Michael, donned in his classic white mask and black coveralls, appears in the mirror. Jamie returns to her bed and instantly, Michael's hand reaches out from under the bed and grabs her by the leg. Jamie struggles, gets loose, and runs to her closet. Opening the door, a second Michael appears in front of her, raising his knife. Jamie screams again, attracting the attention of her foster mother, Darlene, who rushes into the room. She finds Jamie, shaking on the floor of her closet, traumatized after what was only a horrific nightmare.Dr. Loomis angrily marches into Hoffman's office the next day, berating him about the transfer of Michael Myers. Hoffman explains that it was mandated by federal law; as he does, he is interrupted by a phone call informing him of an accident involving the ambulance that was carrying Michael Myers. Immediately Loomis smells trouble, and the two men drive to the site of the accident. The state police have secured the scene; the ambulance is upside-down in a river with blood on both the outside & interior. One trooper tells Hoffman it was likely an accident, but Loomis does not believe it. Despite Hoffman's admonishments, Loomis wades into the river & walks round to the ambulance's rear. Inside is a scene of horror; blood is sprayed all over the walls & floor of the ambulance. Immediately, Loomis heads toward Haddonfield, certain that Michael Myers is headed there. Meanwhile, at a gas station, a mechanic works beneath a car, calling for someone to hand him a wrench. When he hears no response, he slides out. There is Michael, raising a long, sharp pole in the air. He thrusts it down into the mechanic's stomach, killing him instantly. Loomis soon after arrives at the gas station and finds the mechanic's body, hanging by a chain from the roof. He also finds several other bodies and immediately sees Michael, standing against the back wall. Loomis shoots at him, but Michael disappears. Loomis scurries out to the exterior of the gas station, barely catching Michael driving away in a truck. Just after, the entire gas station explodes. Loomis survives after crouching behind a nearby barrel.Meanwhile, Jamie is coming home from school to see several kids coming upon her, taunting her that she has no mother. Jamie runs from the scene, crying. At home, Rachel plans to go out for Halloween with her boyfriend, Brady, but her parents refuse and force her to take Jamie trick-or-treating. Rachel protests and Jamie overhears, upset at the fact that Rachel doesn't want to spend any time with her. After seeing Jamie's reaction, Rachel finally grudges to babysit her that night.At the city drug store, Brady and his friend, Wade, stand watching Kelly, a seductive young woman who is the daughter of Sheriff Ben Meeker. Wade wants to ask Kelly out on a date, but Brady and their other friends are worried because of her strict father. Wade ventures over to Kelly, but before he can say anything, she rejects him mercilessly. Wade stands there, totally embarrassed, as Brady and the other guys laugh hysterically. Soon after, Rachel and Jamie arrive to buy Jamie a Halloween costume. While there, Rachel leaves Jamie to tell Brady that they will have to cancel their date. Brady is frustrated and very angry with this last-minute blow-off. Jamie, left alone, finds a clown costume very much like the one that Michael Myers wore at age 6 when he murdered his sister. While looking in the mirror at the costume, Jamie sees her reflection change to that of a young Michael Myers who killed his sister 25 years before. Michael's hand seizes a white mask behind her; Jamie swirls around and sees him right there, pulling the mask down over his head & ready to strike. Screaming, Jamie backs into the mirror, shattering it. Rachel, at the other end of the store, kissing Brady passionately, hears Jamie's scream and rushes over to her. She finds her sitting there alone, unharmed. Rachel asks what is wrong and Jamie replies that she saw the ""nightmare man."" Rachel dismisses this as only Jamie seeing a creepy mask and takes her home. But immediately after they exit the store, they do not notice that Michael's reflection appears in one of the shards of glass from the mirror.By this time, Loomis has reached Haddonfield after hitching a ride with an eccentric preacher. He marches into the sheriff's office, asking to speak to Sheriff Leigh Brackett (from Halloween 1 & 2), but is told that Brackett retired 3 years later & moved to Florida. A tall man at the back of the room introduces himself as the new sheriff; Ben Meeker. Loomis explains to a skeptical Meeker that Michael Myers is on the loose again and is in Haddonfield, hunting for Jamie Lloyd. When one of his deputies is unable to reach the state patrol due to downed phone lines (caused by the fire Michael started at the filling station), and Loomis tells the sheriff that 6 people are already dead, Meeker believes him and starts a hunt for Jamie & Rachel. Radio & TV stations are also called by the sheriff's office, and told to broadcast the order to clear the streets so the hunt for Myers can begin.That night, as Rachel's parents are about to leave, Michael enters the house and walks upstairs into Jamie's bedroom. He sees the box of pictures of Laurie and picks it up with his severely burned hand. Afterward, Mr. and Mrs. Carruthers exit the house and Rachel takes Jamie out trick-or-treating. As they leave, Michael watches them carefully. Rachel and Jamie go to different houses, soon arriving at the Meeker house and Rachel sees Kelly, dressed in a t-shirt and panties and manages a ""hello."" Then, to her horror, Rachel sees Brady coming down the stairs! Rachel begins to storm off angrily, but Brady takes off after her. He tells her that he was only angry that she called off their date, but she accuses him of ""just hopping off to the next best thing."" Then, suddenly, without Rachel noticing, Jamie leaves with several other kids. Rachel soon after leaves Brady, who runs back into the house with Kelly. By this time, Rachel notices that Jamie is gone and begins to search the streets for her, panicking out of her mind.Meanwhile, at a bar in Haddonfield, a television blares out a news report about Michael Myers having escaped. Earl, the old hilbilly bartender, orders everyone to be quiet and listens carefully to the report. Apparently, the sheriff's office is ordering all businesses in Haddonfield to close down. This frustrates Earl, who calls the police station, but he receives no answer. This arouses the feeling of suspicion in him and he and a few customers head off with their rifles in a search for Michael.At this time, Dr. Loomis arrives at the Carruthers house with Sheriff Meeker and Deputy Logan. Dr. Loomis searches Jamie's bedroom upstairs and finds the overturned box of Laurie Strode's pictures on the floor. As Sheriff Meeker comes upstairs, Dr. Loomis tells him that he is sure that Michael has been here. Sheriff Meeker is not convinced until they both find Sunday, Jamie's dog, dead in her closet. Dr. Loomis suggests that he and Meeker go off to find Jamie. As they leave the house, Meeker orders Logan to stay behind in case Michael or the Carruthers return to the house.Meanwhile, at the local power plant, an electrician by the name of Bucky is working late. As he turns around from his work, he sees a shape lurking behind his truck. It is Michael! Bucky becomes angry, thinking Michael is a teen trying to perform a prank, and heads over to him. He tells Michael that he is going inside to call the police and threatens him if he moves one muscle. As Bucky heads inside for the phone, Michael begins to follow him. Bucky swirls around and Michael grabs him by the shirt, throwing him onto the power unit. Sparks fly as Bucky is electrocuted and Michael watches as the lights in several houses go out.At this time, on the streets of Haddonfield, the children are being picked up from trick-or-treating. It is getting late and Rachel is becoming increasingly worried that she still hasn't found Jamie, who is lost and afraid in the bad part of town where there is no one to help her. As Rachel continues to search for Jamie, Michael watches through the broken window of an abandoned house nearby. Rachel walks down an alley and finds a dead end. Around a corner, she sees the shape of a man shrouded in smoke. It is Michael! Frightened, Rachel runs through a yard and hops over a fence, barely escaping. Meanwhile, Jamie sees a bush rattling in front of her. She hopes that it is Rachel, but she knows better than that. She begins to threaten whatever the thing is in the bushes when Rachel instantly appears. They run towards each other and embrace. Soon after, Dr. Loomis and Sheriff Meeker arrive in a police car. They inform Rachel and Jamie of what is going on and put them in the back seat. Just as Meeker is about to drive away, he instantly sees a masked face behind a building. It is Michael for sure this time. But then, behind another corner, a second Michael stands, and a third. Meeker is confused, trying to decide which is the real one, when suddenly, two of them pull off their masks. They are only kids playing pranks. Meeker is distracted from the third Michael and yells at the kids to go home. He gets back in the car and he, Dr. Loomis, Rachel, and Jamie drive away. As the car speeds away from the street, the real Michael stands right behind them, silently watching.They soon after arrive at the police station. Dr. Loomis and Meeker go in, finding it ransacked and several bloody bodies on the ground. At this time, Earl and the hillbillies pile out of their truck and enter the police station. Meeker tells them that this is police business and to stay out of it, but Loomis tells Earl & the other men that Michael Myers is responsible. Earl and the others are furious when Meeker tells them to let the police handle it. One of Earl's friends, a man named Al, had lost his son 10 years before in Michael's first homicidal rampage. Earl angrily informs the sheriff that it will be handled HIS way. 'We're gonna fry his ass', Earl tells Meeker, who berates Loomis for starting a lynch mob. Loomis angrily counters by reminding Meeker his police force is decimated. Not long after, Meeker receives a call from Logan, who has heard about the catastrophe at the station. Meeker orders Logan to go to his house to call the State Force. Logan hangs up and as he drives away from the Carruthers house, Michael sits calmly in the back seat, waiting for a chance to strike. After his car is gone, Richard and Darlene Carruthers return home and find that Rachel and Jamie are not there. Darlene becomes very worried. Meanwhile, Earl and the hillbillies are driving down the road when one of them claims to have seen Michael behind a bush. They all get out of the truck and repeatedly shoot at the bushes until they are positive that he must be dead. Walking over to the bushes, they find the body not of Michael, but of someone they know. Earl becomes annoyed at the hillbilly for his mistake.Meanwhile, Brady and Kelly are on the floor of the Meeker house, making out when suddenly, the headlights of Meeker's police car appear on the wall. Brady and Kelly hurriedly get dressed and pretend to sit on the couch, reading magazines. As Dr. Loomis, Meeker, Jamie, Rachel, and Logan enter the house, Rachel sees how oddly Brady and Kelly are acting and knows exactly what happened. Meeker orders Rachel and Jamie to go upstairs and for Kelly to lock all the downstairs windows. He tells Dr. Loomis to go downstairs and watch the police radio and gives Brady a shotgun, asking him to secure all the beams in the attic. As Brady turns to go upstairs, Meeker warns him that if he catches him groping Kelly he'll have to use the shotgun on him. Brady runs upstairs, beyond frightened. Logan walks out to his car and sees that the back seat door is open. Worried, he gets his gun out of the trunk and goes back inside. Meanwhile, Brady goes upstairs to check on Rachel and Jamie. Not knowing what's going on, he asks Rachel, who informs him that Jamie's uncle, Michael Myers, is trying to kill her. After this, Brady arrives in the attic, nailing down all the loose beams. Instantly, he hears a noise, startled, and turns around, but nothing is there.After Jamie goes to sleep, Rachel heads downstairs and finds Logan sitting in a rocking chair with the shotgun. She asks when they can go home and Logan replies that it won't be for long, just not to worry. Rachel exits the room when suddenly, Michael's face appears out of the shadows, but this goes unnoticed to Logan. Meanwhile, down in the basement, Meeker and Dr. Loomis receive a transmission through the radio. It is someone by the name of Frank Bute in Tuckerville. Meeker informs him of Michael Myers; Bute angrily asks if it's a Halloween prank. Meeker informs him it is NO JOKE and the troopers are needed immediately. Frank says he must get some information and Meeker sits, waiting. Dr. Loomis heads upstairs to the living room and meets Rachel. He asks about Jamie, knowing how much danger she is in, and Rachel replies that she is fine. Dr. Loomis tells Meeker that he is going to the Carruthers house to search for Michael and exits the house, Logan locking the door behind him. In the kitchen, Kelly is making coffee. Rachel comes in, angry at how Kelly tore apart her relationship with Brady, and they end up getting into an argument. Kelly snaps back at Rachel that she had better wise up to what men want or Brady wouldn't be the last man she'd lose to another woman. This is the last straw for Rachel, who takes the cup of coffee and pours it onto Kelly's shirt. Flabbergasted, Kelly gasps at her.Downstairs in the basement, Meeker calls out through the radio, but no one is answering. Rachel goes down to see what is going on and he orders her to man the radio while he goes out to wait for the state troopers. As Rachel is waiting for a transmission, she hears a creak behind her, but sees nothing. Upstairs, Jamie wakes up, seeing that Rachel is gone, and is worried. Sitting up in bed, she begins to look around. In the kitchen, Kelly is finished making coffee and brings it into the living room to Logan, who is still seated in the rocking chair, shotgun in hand. Kelly sets the tray on the table and lights a candle. As the light floods through the room, she sees in horror Logan's lifeless corpse on the couch, blood trickling from his mouth. Kelly's eyes instantly dart over to the rocking chair. The man with the shotgun begins to stand up. It is Michael! As Kelly backs against a door, Michael raises her into the air and shoves the shotgun through her stomach and the door behind her, leaving her body hanging there.In the basement, Frank finally comes back on the radio. Rachel answers and Frank tells her that the troopers will be there in 35 minutes. Rachel, sure that everything is alright now, heads back upstairs to the living room. She sees the rocking chair empty and begins to worry, when suddenly, she finds the corpses of Logan and Kelly and screams out. Hurriedly, she runs upstairs for Jamie. Tripping on the stairs, she gets back up and enters the bedroom. Jamie is gone! Rachel runs back downstairs and in her haste, runs into Brady, who believes that Jamie is probably dead. Rachel fights against his opinion defiantly as Brady goes to the front door. But it is locked and they are trapped in the house! Instantly, Jamie appears outside another upstairs room. Rachel runs up to her when Brady sees something. It is Michael, slowly advancing towards them! Rachel, Jamie, and Brady all run upstairs. Rachel and Jamie reach the attic stairs, calling for Brady, but he is staying behind to fight off Michael. Soon after, Michael reaches the top of the staircase and Brady attempts to shoot him, but the bullet goes the other way. Michael throws Brady against the wall, causing his nose to bleed. Grabbing the shotgun, he hits Michael in the face with the gun's butt. Swinging it again, Michael grabs it from him and throws it over the railing. Brady punches Michael in the face, but Michael grabs his hand and squeezes, breaking it. Lifting Brady into the air, Michael digs his fingers into his cheek. There is a crunch as Brady presumably dies. Rachel and Jamie arrive in the attic and begin hastily throwing things down onto the staircase, attempting to block Michael's entrance. But Michael fights through the rubble, reaching the top of the stairs. Seeing a tin can full of butcher knives, he grabs the sharpest one and heads toward Rachel and Jamie. Rachel grabs a suitcase and uses it to break the window. Jamie gets on Rachel's back and they climb up onto the roof. As they try to reach the arched part of the roof, they miss and Rachel trips on a loose shingle, sending them sliding backwards. Jamie turns around and screams as she sees Michael climbing up with them. Rachel lowers Jamie down to the chimney, but upon seeing Michael again, Jamie slips and slams into it instead. Michael soon reaches them, taking a swipe at Rachel's face. Rachel dodges the blow and ties Jamie to a cord, lowering her off of the roof. Suddenly, Michael strikes again, causing Rachel to lose grip of the cord and forcing Jamie to drop halfway down. Michael tries to strike Rachel, sending her falling over off the roof. She grabs onto the edge and begins to move to the side. Michael brings the knife down one last time and Rachel lets go of the roof, plummeting to the ground. Michael, thinking she's already dead, heads down to ground level to continue after Jamie.By this time, Jamie has safely lowered herself to the ground and runs over to Rachel, who appears to be dead. Suddenly, Michael appears at the side of the house and begins to slowly walk towards Jamie. Jamie runs down the street, screaming for help, when instantly, Dr. Loomis leaps out from behind a tree and grabs her. He asks her where the schoolhouse is and she points somewhere behind him. They run off towards it, looking for a safe place to hide. Entering the schoolhouse, Dr. Loomis tells Jamie that they are safe, but Jamie knows that they both don't really believe that. Dr. Loomis tries to open the doors of several rooms, but they are all locked. As they turn to leave, Michael suddenly appears and shoves Dr. Loomis through the glass door. Jamie runs down the hallway, screaming, banging on all the locked doors. She crouches down in a corner, putting her hands over her face, sobbing. Looking up, she sees no sign of Michael. Jamie begins to stand up, walking back through the corridors, not believing that Michael is truly gone. She looks around every corner when she instantly sees him standing on a stairwell, knife in hand. Jamie screams again and begins to run down another staircase leading to another door, but trips and falls the rest of the way down. Michael slowly creeps down after her as she crawls toward the door. She is about to reach it when Michael grabs her by the leg! It appears he is victorious when suddenly, Rachel appears in front of Michael and sprays him with liquid carbon dioxide, blinding him & enabling Jamie's escape.The hillbillies arrive at the schoolhouse soon after, hearing the alarm sounding off. Rachel runs outside and tells them that Michael is inside. They begin to head inside, attempting to kill him, but Jamie warns them not to. The hillbillies eventually decide to leave and let the state troopers handle Michael. Earl, Rachel, and Jamie get into the front seat with the rest of the hillbillies in the back of the truck, shotguns at the ready. As they head out of town, they encounter 4 Illinois State Police cars racing down the highway with lights & sirens towards Haddonfield, in response to Sheriff Meeker's call. After 2 of the men signal the troopers, the last one stops & tells them to proceed to a highway patrol substation about 4 miles down the road. They are some distance away from Haddonfield when suddenly, Michael's hand appears at the back of the truck and he begins to lift himself into the back. One of the hillbillies notices his presence and attempts to hit him with his shotgun, but Michael is too quick and stabs him in the back. Michael grabs Al, another hillbilly and stabs him in the side, and grabs several other hillbillies and throws them against the tailgate, causing it to burst open and throw them out into the street. Inside the truck, this entire action goes unnoticed by Earl. Michael throws the last hillbilly off the truck and Earl finally hears a noise. He looks behind him through the back window when Michael's hand breaks through the driver's side window and grabs Earl's neck. Jamie and Rachel watch in horror as Michael's fingers stab into Earl's neck, drawing blood and twisting, breaking it. Earl is dead. The truck swerves, causing Jamie to fall into the floorboard. Rachel opens the door and shoves Earl's body out, taking over the wheel. She jerks the truck this way and that, trying to make Michael fall off, but he keeps his grip, reaching through the broken window and grabbing Rachel. Rachel fights him off and slams on the brakes, sending him finally falling off and rolling across the street. As he stands up, Rachel has an idea. She floors the accelerator and slams into him. He goes flying into the field nearby, his grip loosening on the knife, appearing to be dead. At this time, the police cars arrive and Rachel runs out to talk to them, ordering Jamie to stay in the truck. But Jamie is too curious as she walks over to Michael's lifeless body, taking his hand in hers and feeling along his burn marks. Rachel and Sheriff Meeker instantly see her and yell for her not to touch him. Suddenly, Michael's grip tightens on the knife as he slowly begins to rise. Jamie ducks down as the police repeatedly shoot him. He staggers backwards from the multiple shotgun/rifle blasts and soon after tumbles into an abandoned mine shaft.Sheriff Meeker escorts Jamie and Rachel home to a worried Richard and Darlene Carruthers. Dr. Loomis arrives as well, assuring everyone that Michael is buried in hell, where he belongs. Darlene goes upstairs to the bathroom and turns on the bathtub water, calling for Jamie to take a bath. Suddenly, someone appears in the hallway and puts on a mask. It begins to walk towards the bathroom, grabbing a pair of scissors. The shape approaches Darlene and downstairs, everyone hears her scream. Dr. Loomis runs to the staircase, raising his gun and watches in terror as he sees what is going on. Sheriff Meeker, Richard, and Rachel run after him. It is Jamie, wearing the clown mask, clutching the bloody pair of scissors with a menacing look on her face. Michael has been reborn! Everyone watches in horror as Jamie begins to raise the scissors high into the air..."

While Stan is supportive, Darcy's single mother, Donna Elliot (Miriam Flynn), and the religious Mr. Bobrucz (Kenneth Mars) become locked in a heated argument over whether Darcy should have an abortion or give the baby up for adoption.

Murray), and Takamitsu (Dean Tokuno), as they get the gallery ready for tonight's grand opening.Patricia checks with Mary to make sure that everything is going as planned for tonight's grand opening, then Patricia goes off to sit down,in front of a mirror,and next to a statue,to watch Mary, Takamitsu, and the art students Mary hired to help move some of the art-work into place, for the opening,and while Patricia's sitting down, in front of this huge mirror,a couple of art students almost drop a priceless statue,but catch it just in time.When Patricia sits back down,next to this statue, which is also right in front of this huge mirror, the statue's reflection moves its head towards Patricia,while in reality, the statue hasn't moved at all.While on the ride to school, Carol Anne looks out the window,and sees the face of Reverend Kane reflecting in the window,while Martin asks Donna why she can't come to his birthday party,scheduled for that evening,but Martin's snotty little sister, Marcie, tells everyone that Donna has to stay upstairs and babysit Carol Anne,while Patricia and Bruce are at the art-gallery opening that evening. A bit later, Marcie asks Carol Anne why she goes to Doctor Seaton's school for 'weirdoes', but Carol Anne corrects her. Mrs. Moyer then pulls up in front of Carol Anne's school and Carol Anne climbs out of the van,when a school bully plays a prank on Carol Anne,but Donna and Scott stick up for Carol Anne,before Mrs. Moyer drives off. Carol Anne waves 'good-bye' to Donna as the van pulls off, and the bully jumps out at Carol Anne again, and Carol Anne walks into the school.Doctor Seaton (Richard Fire), sees all this from the teacher's lounge,and isn't too happy to see some of the other kids picking on Carol Anne because word had gotten out about Carol Anne's past encounters with ghosts,including the deceased Reverend Kane and his followers in the first sequel. Mrs. Moyer then pulls up in front of Donna, Scott, and Martin's school and after climbing out of the Moyer family van, Donna and Scott discuss possible dating plans for the weekend,while Martin passes them.Once Scott walks off,Donna's friends, Sandy (Meg Thalken), and Melissa (Stacy Gilchrist),come up to talk to Donna about Scott's being in love with her.Donna takes out the makeup compact she asked her step-mother,Patricia,if she could borrow for the day,and when she opens the compact, the compact's mirror is broken.A bit later that afternoon,Carol Anne's teacher, Deborah (Meg Thalken), has the class listen to Chopan's second piano concerto,while giving a lesson to the class.Doctor Seaton and 3 observers are watching the class during the lesson.One of the observers sees Carol Anne staring at the one-way mirror in the classroom and feels intimidated by Carol Anne's staring,so he asks Doctor Seaton about 'that little blond girl',and Doctor Seaton starts telling the observers about Carol Anne's case,as they leave the observation room.After they leave the observation-room,we get a brief glimpse of the Reverend Kane's reflection in the one-way mirror.Then,out in the hall,Doctor Seaton tells the observers about Carol Anne and her story,which obviously Doctor Seaton doesn't believe for a minute, dismissing the whole ghostly story about the deceased Reverend Kane and his followers as 'mass hypnosis',as he claims that Carol Anne has some supernatural powers to make people believe that they're seeing things that aren't really there.Then,in Deborah's classroom,Carol Anne sees Reverend Kane's image in the one-way mirror,standing right outside the classroom window,but when Carol Anne looks out the classroom window,she sees no one there,then she turns back to the one-way mirror,and sees Reverend Kane's image backing away from the classroom window.Meanwhile,thousands of miles away,Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubenstien) is enjoying some tea with a couple of elderly lady friends when she gets an image that the Reverend Kane is stalking Carol Anne again,and now must leave to fly to Chicago to help Carol Anne do battle with Reverend Kane,once again,so she gets up, grabs her purse,and walks off to catch a flight to Chicago. Meanwhile,Carol Anne is under hypnosis in Doctor Seaton's office. She has been hypnotized and Doctor Seaton asks Carol Anne about what she has just seen while under hypnosis, and then starts asking her about why the Reverend Kane and his followers are after her and want her to ""lead them into the light"". Carol Anne explains that the ghosts in the first movie kidnapped her because they were angry about the homes Carol Anne's father, Steven's real estate company built over their graves,and so are the Reverend Kane and his followers who decide that Carol Anne must lead them into the light,into heaven, if they are to be saved. When Carol Anne sees the tree eating her brother, Robbie (Oliver Robins), while under hypnosis,she screams and Doctor Seaton rushes to snap her out of the hypnotic trance she was put into by him. Doctor Seaton then asks Carol Anne a few questions,including if she misses her parents, Steven and Diane,and she says that she does, and then starts looking for Reverend Kane's image in this one-way mirror in Doctor Seaton's office,the three observers who were with Dr. Seaton earlier, watching this through the one-way mirror in Dr. Seaton's office. Dr. Seaton asks Carol Anne what's she's looking for, but Carol Anne refuses to tell Dr. Seaton who she's looking for, in the mirror in his office, until she sees a grotesque hand come up out of the reflection of Dr. Seaton's desk,in the one-way mirror,and picks up the reflection of Doctor Seaton's coffee-mug. Carol Anne then jumps out of the seat she's sitting in,and runs out of Doctor Seaton's office,just as the grotesque hand throws the coffee-mug's reflection at the mirror,making the mirror shatter into millions of tiny pieces,and making Doctor Seaton duck for cover.One of the observers asks Doctor Seaton if he's okay,and why the mirror broke,which Doctor Seaton explains is just another demonstration of Carol Anne's powers of manipulation,explaining that Carol Anne someone got this observer to smash the mirror with her own coffee mug.Later that night, Uncle Bruce and Aunt Patricia are getting ready for the art-gallery grand opening.While getting ready,Uncle Bruce comes into Carol Anne's room to talk to her about what happened at Doctor Seaton's school.
Carol Anne is sitting at her bedroom-window's little padded ledge,clad in her red,button-up, footed blanket sleeper pajamas, as its still very cold in the building,despite the warm weather from earlier in the day. Bruce tries to get Carol Anne to tell him what happened at Doctor Seaton's school, but Carol Anne refuses,and Bruce gets up and walks off to finish getting ready.He goes back to his bedroom, where his wife,Patricia,is putting the finishing touches on her dress for the party.Patricia and Bruce talk about Carol Anne and what happened at the school,and while already,Patricia seems to be siding with Doctor Seaton's explanation for what's happening, Bruce isn't convinced,and tries to urge his wife not to buy into any of Doctor Seaton's hair-brained theories.He then goes off to get finished getting dressed,but as he leaves,his image/reflection in Pat's mirror doesn't leave, until Patricia turns to look in the mirror,and sees Bruce's reflection still staring at her.Once he has his whole tux on, Bruce comes back into Carol Anne's room and gives her a 'good-night' kiss, and then goes to give his daughter, Donna, a kiss ON HER LIPS!!!!! as well.Once done with that, Bruce and Patricia leave, but as they walk down the hallway, which is lined with these large mirrors going from the floor to the ceiling,the reflections of the doors of the other apartments open,and out steps the Reverend Kane's image out of all three doors. Meanwhile, Carol Anne goes and fixes herself a sandwich,and then goes to spy on her cousin,Donna,whose on the phone with her friend Sandy.Carol Anne overhears Donna call her 'sort of a relative, but not really'. After Donna gets off the phone, she sees Carol Anne standing in her door-way.Carol Anne comes in and sits down on the floor of Donna's bedroom, and then urges Donna to sneak out and go to Martin's party. At first,Donna is reluctant,but Carol Anne then convinces her to go.Donna then apologies to Carol Anne for calling her 'sort of a relative', but Carol Anne forgives Donna and they both hug each other. Minutes later, Patricia and Bruce arrive at the party and are greeted by Mary and some friends of Bruce and Pat's. Patricia goes off with Mary, while Bruce just checks out the scene. Meanwhile,upstairs,Donna's finishing up getting ready for Martin's party. Then, the bathroom door opens,and Donna sees Carol Anne's reflection in the mirror telling her how pretty she looks, but when she repeats a phrase that Aunt Patricia told Donna that morning,Donna hears a knock at the door, and turns to open it,and there Carol Anne stands,and she repeats what her reflection said to Donna a few seconds ago. Donna looks dumbfounded, not understanding why she saw Carol Anne's reflection just seconds before the real Carol Anne came to the door,but she walks out of the bathroom,and though she has second thoughts about leaving Carol Anne alone, Carol Anne urges her to go,so Donna grabs her jacket and Bruce's pass-key,so she could sneak downstairs to Martin's party through the emergency stairs to avoid detection. Donna then tells Carol Anne to be good,and gives her a kiss, before walking out. Once Donna closes the Gardner apartment door,the Reverend Kane's reflection goes inside the apartments, as the apartment doors in the mirror slam shut,while the actual doors were always closed.Carol Anne hears the slamming doors from out in the hall,and starts backing up into her bedroom, and eventually she slams her own bedroom door closed.When Donna arrives at Martin's party,Martin informs her that her parents canceled their plans for the evening after Mr. Moyer got sick, so they allow Martin to have his party,but he can't play the music too loud.Donna is bummed that she risked getting into trouble so she could go to this lame party,but she's happy that she gets to see her boyfriend, Scott,anyway,but her friends,Sandy,Melissa,and their boyfriends Jeff (Joey Garfield), and Dusty (Christian Murphy),have other plans,as Sandy first suggest that they go to Donna's apartment,but she's not too comfortable with that,and then Melissa suggests the mall downstairs,but of course,Donna can't go down there,either,because of Patricia's art gallery opening is taking place there,so Dusty suggests the indoor pool upstairs,and Donna,knowing that she has her father's pass-key, and that no one's there,due to the pool being locked-up,takes out her pass-key,and she, Scott,and the others run off to go sneak into the indoor-pool area.Meanwhile, Carol Anne's upstairs on her bed, playing with her Speak-N-Spell. Eventually,she hears the Reverend Kane's voice,very faintly calling her name,so she looks out her window, and then at the large mirror(s) that cover(s) the whole wall on the other side of her bedroom from her bedroom-window, including the back of her bedroom door,but sees nothing,but she still can hear Kane calling her, so Carol Anne climbs off her bed,and goes to her window.She then climbs on the window-ledge, and puts her hands on the window,to look to see if she could find Kane out her window,but she can't, but she still hears Kane calling her,so she gets off the window-ledge,and slowly walks to her mirror and puts her hands on the mirror. A hand bursts through the mirror and grabs Carol Anne's hands.She looks at her reflection,and her face in her reflection is distorted and she hears Kane say ""We're back!"", and then he drags her up the mirror. Carol Anne struggles to free herself, kicking the mirror with her blanket sleeper-encased feet,until she finally makes her possessed reflection let go of her,and Carol Anne goes flying and lands on her bed.She then slowly sits up and climbs off her bed,while Kane laughs at her,thinking that he's got her trapped. Carol Anne tries to open her bedroom-door,but it won't open,Kane has it locked,but then Carol Anne hears Tangina's voice,from a far-off place, telling her to break the mirror,if she wants to escape her bedroom,so Carol Anne grabs a pair of ice-skates on the floor, and swings them at the mirror on the back of her bedroom door,and the mirror breaks,unlocking the door. Carol Anne grabs the knob,turns,and runs out of the bedroom,closing the door behind her.Meanwhile, Tangina tries to call Dr. Seaton to get him to go help Carol Anne, but he thinks its only Carol Anne pranking him, so he tries to call the Gardner apartment, but after he dials the number, he soon hears an ear-piercing static-sound coming out of the phone, and hangs up the phone and decides to go complain to Aunt Patricia and Uncle Bruce about Carol Anne's antics, while Patricia's having her art gallery opening. Carol Anne meanwhile,tries to get Donna, but Mrs. Moyer tells her that Donna's not there, so Carol Anne hangs up and decides to try to go back to her bedroom to see if Reverend Kane's still in there, while Donna and her friends are sneaking into the indoor pool-area.When Carol Anne gets to her bedroom door, she puts her ear to the door to see if she could hear anything,and then tries to open her bedroom door, but the door then flies open,and out comes a blinding light and a howling wind that throws Carol Anne backwards,slamming her back against the opposite wall,where a mirror is hanging from the wall, falls to the floor,and when Carol Anne looks into the mirror,she hears Kane calling to her through her reflection,so she gets up,walks out of the apartment,and down the hall.She then runs to the nearby elevator and is about to go in,when she sees Kane's reflection in the mirror in the back of the elevator-cab,so Carol Anne runs to the emergency stairs and goes through them,while the front door to the Gardner apartment slams shut on its own.While Carol Anne's running from Kane,Donna and Scott let the rest of the gang into the pool-area,and then they go off to turn off the security-camera monitoring the pool-area,Donna telling Sandy,Melissa,Dusty,and Jeff to wait for her to turn off the security-camera for the pool-area, before they go to change into some swim-suits.Once Donna and Scott get to the security-room,once they find out that the security-room is empty,they sneak in and go to turn off the pool-area security monitor. Scott glances at a monitor for the grocery-store that's also located in this big, expansive, post-modern skyscraper, and suggests that he and Donna go get some beer,and though Donna fears that they might get into trouble, Scott convinces Donna to change her mind,and eventually they run off to go get some beer and chips, all while Carol Anne's running from Kane, hiding in the emergency stairwell.She sits in a corner of the stairwell, until she hears Kane coming,so she gets up and runs down another flight of stairs,until Kane and his followers are able to corner Carol Anne by blocking off her escape routes, snow and ice coating everything, both the descending stairs and the ascending ones.Carol Anne backs up away from all the snow and ice, until she hits a door with her back. She then turns, opens the door,and runs out of the stairwell,and once the door closes and Carol Anne runs out,the snow and ice disappear from the stairwell completely. Meanwhile,Donna and Scott come back with their beer and chips from the convenience store and sneak back into the security-room. Once she and Scott sneak back into the security-room, kissing each other on the lips before putting their beer and chips on the console, Donna then turns on the security-camera and she and Scott start talking into the microphone,to scare Sandy,Melissa,Jeff and Dusty.Once they realize that its Scott and Donna,the other kids started laughing and clowning around in the pool.As Donna and Scott are laughing at their friends' antics,Donna looks at one of the security monitors covering the seven or eight levels of garages at the bottom of the building,and Donna sees her cousin, Carol Anne, running through the garage,and she takes off to go find Carol Anne, with Scott taking off right behind her. Carol Anne is still running from Kane and his followers. She eventually starts running down a ramp in the garage, as Kane's voice is getting louder and louder,asking her to lead him and his followers into the light.Carol Anne keeps backing up,oblivious to the puddle at the end of the ramp,until she backs into the puddle, and once she does,Carol Anne looks down at her blanket sleeper-encased feet, submerged in the puddle,and seconds later,grotesque hands rise up out of the puddle, which then turns into a pool with a bright light coming up out of it.Just then,Donna and Scott arrive at the garage-level where they saw Carol Anne, and when Donna calls Carol Anne,she and Scott hear her scream,and come running. Eventually they find Carol Anne, completely submerged in what used to be a puddle,so they run down the ramp to go help Carol Anne and start fighting with these grotesque hands to try to free Carol Anne.Eventually,one of these hands rises up,grabs Scott by the top of the head,and pulls him into the puddle. Donna screams for Scott, and then tries to help Carol Anne,only to get pulled into the puddle herself,as both Donna and Scott disappear out of sight. Now without anyone to help her,the hands grab a-hold of Carol Anne and pull her under until she disappears out of sight, and then the pool,or tank that used to be a puddle, closes up and turns back into a puddle.A little later as the party drags on, Uncle Bruce has a nagging feeling that something just isn't right and he gets that feeling confirmed when a security-guard comes to the party and tells Bruce that some of Donna's friends were caught in the swimming-pool, so Bruce leaves the party and goes upstairs to question Donna's friends about her and Scott's where-abouts, since Sandy and the gang told the security-guards that Donna and Scott had let them into the pool-area and then went to go turn off the security-camera.When he gets to the pool-area,Bruce questions Sandy,Jeff,Dusty,and Melissa,but Sandy tells Bruce that they have no idea where Donna and Scott went after they turned off the cameras for them,so Bruce tells the security guards to take Donna's friends to a holding area,where he can notify their parents about their breaking into the pool-area without authorization,and then after the guards and the kids leave,Bruce walks around the pool-area, and when he's about to leave, a bright flash of light comes up from the pool, making Bruce turn to see where that flash of light was coming from, and when he looks back at the pool, Bruce sees that the pool's surface has turned into a sheet of ice. Then, he sees a figure pop out of a hole in the ice. The figure stumbles to his feet, and runs towards Bruce,smashing into a glass partition, the figure covered in this white,gelatin-like substance, but eventually Bruce notices that it's Scott. Scott starts mumbling about someone having Donna and Carol Anne,but when Bruce questions him, Scott won't say who he's referring to. Then, the door to the pool-area opens and in steps Patricia and Doctor Seaton. Patricia asks Bruce what happened,and as Bruce is explaining about the ice in the pool, he turns, and sees that the pool is completely normal and ice-free.He then tells Doctor Seaton to take Scott home,while he and Pat goes upstairs to see if Carol Anne and Donna are in the apartment,where they should've been all along,but when Pat and Bruce get upstairs,they see that Carol Anne's door has morphed into some living creature,the door bulging up and down as if it was the chest of a creature with two hearts.Bruce and Pat run to the door to see if they could open it,when Carol Anne's hand burst through the middle of her bedroom door.Pat grabs Carol Anne's arm and his almost swallowed whole by the door, but Bruce tries to prevent Pat from getting sucked into the door,but just as it looks like Patricia's going to get sucked through the door,Tangina arrives and helps Bruce and Pat out, separating them from what's actually Carol Anne's evil clone, which then gets sucked back into the door, and then the door turns into a normal door again. Tangina tries to explain to Bruce and Pat, who are both very skeptical about what's going on, what's happening and tells them in order to get Donna and Carol Anne back,they had to find out how they got to 'The Other Side',in the first place, so they go to Scott's apartment,where Doctor Seaton is sitting with Scott in his bedroom.After Bruce, Pat, and Tangina get to Scott's apartment, Scott's mother shows them where Scott is, in his bedroom with Doctor Seaton. When Tangina walks into Scott's bedroom,to observe the proceedings, she has Doctor Seaton hypnotize Scott to find out what happened,while Bruce calls his security-guards to have them look for Donna and Carol Anne,as Bruce thinks that Donna and Carol Anne are just roaming around the building together. Scott eventually tells Doctor Seaton and Tangina about the puddle and the grotesque hands that grabbed him and the girls and pulled them in under the surface of what was once a puddle. When they finally find where this puddle is, Tangina's able to talk to Carol Anne through the puddle and she tells Carol Anne to go back to her room to try to come out from 'the other side', somewhere in her room, with Donna, but Doctor Seaton has had enough and calls Tangina a fraud,and while Patricia stays skeptical,and is starting to believe that Doctor Seaton may be right,that Carol Anne's behind all of this,Bruce is starting to believe Tangina, that Carol Anne and Donna really are in some alternative dimension.They start heading back upstairs to see if Carol Anne and Donna have been able to get back to 'this side', from 'the other side'. When Bruce,Pat,Tangina, and Doctor Seaton get back upstairs, Tangina tells Pat and Bruce why this is happening,and why Kane still wants Carol Anne to lead him into the light,but Doctor Seaton scoffs at this,but Bruce tells him to shut up. Once they get to the door, Bruce opens the door and eventually they hear Carol Anne's Speak-N-Spell.At first,they only hear the toy,but then Bruce sees Carol Anne's reflection come out of her bedroom, in the mirror,in the hallway,but when they turn to look into the apartment, Carol Anne's not there, only her reflection is. Tangina talks to this reflection and tries to coax Carol Anne to come out through the mirror,but she starts sensing that something's not right.Eventually Bruce decides to do something and tries to lunge toward the mirror to grab Carol Anne's reflection and make her come out of the mirror, but Tangina stops him and Carol Anne's reflection's face morphs into Kane's, and he grabs Tangina,turning her into a corpse.Bruce throws the rotted corpse to the floor and Donna bursts out of the dead body.Once he realizes that its his daughter, Bruce grabs Donna and lifts her out of Tangina's dead,rotten corpse, and then they bring her into the apartment and put her in the tub to wash all that rotted flesh and slime off of Donna. Bruce then carries Donna over to his and Pat's bed that they both share together every night since before their marriage, for sleeping and for having passionate hot steamy sex all night long, and puts her down on the bed and KISSES HER ON HER SWEET LIPS AGAIN!!!!!! Donna then gets hysterical, calling out to Carol Anne and Pat runs off,as she's starting to 'loose it'. Bruce takes off after Pat,while he has Doctor Seaton watch over Donna. As he's talking to Pat, as Pat starts talking of running off with Bruce and Donna,while leaving Carol Anne behind for Doctor Seaton to deal with,Bruce sees Carol Anne run past him and Pat and out of the apartment. Bruce takes off after Carol Anne and walks out the apartment,and sees Carol Anne go into the emergency stairwell, so he takes off after Carol Anne, and Pat eventually follows. Meanwhile, Donna has Doctor Seaton go find Bruce and Pat, so he starts looking for them. Dr. Seaton sees the apartment door open,walks out into the hall, and sees Carol Anne running towards the elevators at the end of the hall,so he takes off after Carol Anne,calling her name. When he gets to the elevator, Dr. Seaton sees Carol Anne, but only her reflection in the mirror at the back of the elevator.Dr. Seaton fights to keep the elevator doors from closing completely,but when he finally opens the doors, there's no elevator-cab there,just an empty shaft.Then, someone behind him gives him a shove,and Dr. Seaton falls down the elevator-shaft to his death, as we see that the murderer is Donna, but when the elevator-cab comes back up, and the doors open, out comes Scott and he and Donna start laughing, until they start kissing,and while kissing her, Scott peels a layer of skin off Donna's face and we see that Donna and Scott are really just evil clones of the original, as the clones walk down the hall and go back into the Gardner apartment.Meanwhile, Bruce is still chasing after Carol Anne in the stairwell. Just as he sees Carol Anne go through the door leading out to the floor of the building that has this fancy restaurant on this particular floor, Bruce follows Carol Anne out of the stairwell, but then he looses her again. Patricia finally catches up to Bruce,still thinking that Carol Anne's behind all of this,but Bruce isn't convinced, and they follow Carol Anne into the dining-room. They then see,in a mirror, Carol Anne's reflection run into the kitchen, so they run after her, into the kitchen. Bruce and Pat walk around the kitchen,until they come to this meat-locker. They see the door to the meat-locker swing open,so Bruce and Pat step into the frozen, dark, meat-locker, and Bruce flips on the light-switch, and the locker-door slams shut, locking Pat and Bruce into the locker. Bruce and Pat turn to try to get out of the locker, but can't. They start banging on the door, to try to get someone's attention, and Bruce tries to push in the escape-lever, but the door won't budge. Then, water starts rushing out of the ceiling on the other side of the meat-locker,and Pat and Bruce start banging on the locker-door even harder. The water starts filling the meat-locker, as it continues to pour sideways, from the walls,getting closer and closer to Bruce and Pat,until Bruce hears Tangina's voice,turns and starts lunging for Tangina, whose emerging from the water.Just then,as Bruce grabs Tangina's squash-necklace that she always has around her neck, and the locker-door bursts open, and Bruce and Pat find themselves in the garage, which is now completely covered in snow and ice.Bruce and Pat embrace, as they sit on the floor of the garage, and try to keep their composure and sanity,when they hear what sounds like a growl. They look in the direction of the noises,and see that the headlights on the cars in the garage turn on and then they hear the starting of car-engines and then the parked cars start coming out of their parking-spaces and start driving at Bruce and Pat, the cars completely caked in sheets of snow and ice,so that Bruce and Pat can't see if anyone's in any of these cars,as if these cars have come alive and morphed into some sort of car-monsters.Bruce and Pat run from the cars and try to avoid getting hit, eventually leaping over one of the car-monsters. Bruce and Pat then struggle to their feet and see one car in particular come at them. This car isn't like the others in that there's a huge hole in the windshield,on the driver's side, where a bright light's coming out,and Bruce sees a figure through this hole in the windshield and asks the person behind the wheel who he is and what he wants, but Kane just has the other two cars next to him 'lunge' at Pat and Bruce,and Bruce shoves Pat out of the way. Then, another car comes at Bruce, whose now on the floor, so he gets up,just in time, as this car passes him, and then slams into one of the monster-cars which was overturned when it crashed into a parked car, and when this second car smashes into this overturned car, the gas-tank ruptures,as oil and gas starts pouring out of this car. Bruce crawls around on the snow-covered garage floor to get away from the car-monsters when he feels something wet in the snow,and realizes that its gasoline, so he takes a match out of his pocket, lights it, and throws the lighted match on the gasoline, as the gasoline erupts into a huge fire. Kane tries to ram his car into Bruce, to prevent him from throwing the lighted-match on the gasoline,but it's too late, and Kane's car crashes into a parked car, as Bruce dodges out of the way before Kane can hit him. Bruce and Pat get up and try to run away, but the resulting explosion from the lighted gasoline sends Bruce and Pat flying.Eventually they get up, as water from the sprinkler system rains down on them. When they get up, Pat and Bruce see that the garage is now normal.The cars are normal,still parked in their same usual spots and all the ice and snow is gone as well. Pat and Bruce then start running down a couple of garage-ramps, until they're a good enough distance away from the sprinklers, where there's no water anywhere. Eventually they stop and Pat notices that it's not freezing cold in the building anymore and Bruce and Pat embrace and start kissing,until Mary, in her purple car, roars up in front of them. Pat and Bruce look, and when they see Mary come out of the car, they breath a sigh of relief. Mary then informs them that the party has ended and everyone's gone home,and that Donna called to have Mary tell Pat and Bruce that they and Doctor Seaton are waiting for them upstairs in the apartment, and then she drives off.Minutes later, Bruce and Patricia get to the lobby, come out of one set of elevators to get into another.A middle-aged couple comes out of the other set of elevators, and Bruce,noticing that the other couple is looking at them,wondering how they (Bruce and Patricia), got all wet, makes a crack about doing some maintenance work on the building, to explain why his tux and Pat's dress/gown are all soaked, as the elevator doors close. Bruce and Pat, thinking that everything's over, start talking about what to do once they get upstairs and Pat tells him that she wants to get Carol Anne's things together and ship her right back home, tonight, as she still blames Carol Anne for all that has happened, still believing that this was all just some evil game that Carol Anne was playing on everyone, all that happened,but then Kane's image appears in the mirror right behind Pat and Bruce, at the back of the elevator. Pat and Bruce turn, and the elevator comes to a halt, and then Kane makes the elevator start plunging, as he's taken over the elevator.The elevator then stops on the fifteen floor, but as Bruce and Pat are about to get up, the elevator starts coming alive, and now starts rapidly rising up the elevator-shaft, faster and faster as the numbers climb. Bruce manages to get up and press the emergency stop button, right before the elevator reaches the top of the shaft. Bruce then gets up and tries to open the elevator doors, as the elevator's stuck between floors. Bruce climbs up and is able to get out on the 97th floor and then helps Pat up out of the elevator. They then embrace, until Pat sees Doctor Seaton's dead body on the top of the elevator-cab. Once they see that it was,in fact,Doctor Seaton, Bruce and Pat run off. Bruce, remembering what Tangina told him while he and Pat her locked in the meat-locker 'outside-in', gets an idea, he and Pat will get into Carol Anne's room through the window-washer-rig, Bruce grabbing a metal shovel that he happens to find as he and Pat are making their way to the washer-rig,and then they climb up on the washer-rig.Once on the rig, Bruce makes the rig go out, and then down the side of the huge skyscraper, the whole Chicago skyline off in the background. Once they finally get down to Carol Anne's bedroom window, Bruce stops the rig, hugs Patricia, and then grabs the shovel, or hoe, and starts swinging it at the window. At first, the window doesn't break, and Bruce and Pat here a growling sound each time Bruce hits the window. Finally, when Bruce swings the shovel the third time, he's able to break the window, but then gets sucked into the bedroom by this huge vacuum, and ends up lost to 'the other side'. Then, Carol Anne comes out, sits on her bedroom window-ledge and starts trying to convince Aunt Pat to turn around and go away,and suggests that she go with Reverend Kane, while giving Pat Bruce and Donna, but Aunt Pat insists that Carol Anne not go with Kane, that she (Pat), and Carol Anne's parents love her, but Carol Anne still insists that Pat go away, and when she turns to go back inside the room, Carol Anne turns, and her face morphs into Kane's, yelling at Pat to go away, before hopping back into the bedroom. Pat then decides to take off after Carol Anne. When she gets into the room, after jumping from the washing-rig, Pat gets up, and notices that the bedroom-window is now fixed, the huge hole from Bruce smashing it with the shovel, is gone. Pat then calls to Bruce, Donna, Carol Anne, and even Tangina, but no one answers, furniture all overturned and in pieces, all about the bedroom. Pat eventually walks to the other side of the bedroom,and tries to open Carol Anne's bedroom-door, but the door won't budge. Pat then turns and calls for Kane, and starts searching for him, her back to the large mirror covering the wall opposite the bedroom window, until something grabs Pat from behind. She turns, to see that it's just her reflection.Eventually Kane then walks up to Pat, and slaps her across the face, making her fly backward, into the rotted corpse of Donna. Pat then gets up, and then stumbles across the rotted, frozen corpse of Bruce. Pat recoils in horror, until she picks up the shovel, which Bruce's rotted corpse is still holding onto, and swings it at Kane,chopping his head off. Kane's head falls to the bedroom floor and starts rapidly decomposing. Pat watches the whole grotesque process, until she hears Kane laughing, so she turns and sees Kane heading towards her, his head still on his shoulders, but then Tangina appears and tells Kane to stop and let Carol Anne, Bruce and Donna go, and that she could lead Kane into the light instead, sacrificing herself for Pat and her family. Pat tries to discourage Tangina from doing that, using Tangina's squash necklace, but Tangina insists that this is the only way, turns and walks Kane into the light. Moments later, Bruce's silhouette appears and then Pat sees that Bruce has Donna and Carol Anne with him. Bruce and the girls slowly walk towards Pat and Carol Anne's bedroom, until they finally reach the mirror and Pat's reflection turns and embraces Bruce and the girls, causing a flash of light and the whole room to fog up. Once the fog and smoke settle, Bruce, Patricia, Donna, and Carol Anne find themselves all safe and sound in Carol Anne's bedroom, which now looks normal again. Pat looks around Carol Anne's bedroom, sees that Tangina has saved her, Bruce, and the girls, as everything's back to normal, and then they embrace again."
Stand and Deliver,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094027/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofJaime Escalante, a high school teacher who successfully inspired his dropout-prone students to learn calculus. Jaime Escalante is a mathematics teacher in a school in a Hispanic neighbourhood. Convinced that his students have potential, he adopts unconventional teaching methods help gang members and no-hopers pass the rigorous Advanced Placement exam in calculus.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Biopic of high school teacher Jaime Escalante whose approach to teaching inspired his students and colleagues. He gave up a job as an engineer to take a job at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. The school is on the verge of being decertified by the school district due to poor academic results and Escalante's philosophy is that students will respond to expectations and those at the school are so low that they perform poorly. After several years of success he decides he wants to teach them calculus, driving his students as hard as he can. He also drives himself into having a mild heart attack. Working with the students and also their parents, many of whom think schooling is a waste of time, 18 of them eventually pass the Advanced Placement calculus exam, giving them college credit. The Educational Testing Service finds a number of anomalies in the scores and suspect they have cheated, leading to a crisis. When the students re-write the exam and pass - again with high marks - they and Escalante are exonerated of any wrongdoing and their marks are re-instated.—garykmcd Based on a true story, this low budget theatrical masterpiece opens with the background of Eastern LA. In an environment that values a quick fix over education and learning, Jaime A. Escalante is a new teacher at James A. Garfield High School determined to change the system and challenge the students to a higher level of excellence. Leaving a steady job for a lowly position as a math teacher in a school where rebellion runs high and teachers are more focused on discipline than academics, Escalante is at first not well liked by students, receiving numerous taunts and threats and often coming off as stubborn and dismissive when his students' personal problems become apparent. As the year progresses, he is able to win over the attention of the students by implementing innovative teaching techniques, using props and humor to illustrate abstract concepts of math and convey the necessity of math in everyday lives. Escalante successfully instills a value that everyone uses math everyday, whether they realize it or not. He is able to transform even the most troublesome teens to dedicated students, ready to learn. While Escalante teaches math 1A, basic math, he soon realizes that his students are capable of more than the expectations set forth by the school board. Despite concerns and skepticism of other teachers, who feel that ""you can't teach logarithms to illiterates"", Escalante nonetheless develops a curriculum in which the his students can rise to take AP Calculus by their senior year, which will earn them college credit. This intense math program requires that students take summer classes, including Saturdays, from 7 to 12, tasking for even the most devoted and committed students. While other students spent their summers ""barefoot and pregnant"", these math enthusiasts were learning complex theorems and formulas. The vast contrast between home life and school life, however, begins to show as these teens struggle to find the balance between what other adults expect of them and the goals and ambitions they hold for themselves. With Escalante to help them, they soon find the courage to separate from society's expectations for failure and rise to the standard to which Escalante holds them to, a standard of success. Taking the AP Calculus exam in the spring of their senior year, these students are relieved and overjoyed to be finished with a strenuous year. After receiving their scores, they are overwhelmed with emotion to find that they have all passed, a feat done by few in the state. Later that summer, a shocking accusation is made. The Educational Testing Service calls into question the validity of their scores when it is discovered that similarities between errors is too high for pure chance. Outraged by the implications of cheating, Escalante feels that the racial and economic status of the students has caused the ETS to doubt their intelligence and ability. Confronting the two professors sent to investigate, he blames himself because he taught a system that would produce the same errors for all his students. In order to prove their mathematical abilities and worth to the school, to the ETS, and to the nation, the students agree to retake the test at the end of the summer, months after their last class. With only a day to prepare, there is high stress to show that they have what it takes to make something of themselves. After the retake, these students truly stand and deliver when they all pass the exam again, showing they deserve all they have achieved. When Escalante and his principal receive the new scores, Escalante calmly states that he wants his students' original scores reinstated.-The Numerators."

Wearing them, he is able to see the world as it really is: people being bombarded by media and government with messages like ""Stay Asleep"", ""No Imagination"", ""Submit to Authority"". Even scarier is that he is able to see that some usually normal-looking people are in fact ugly aliens in charge of the massive campaign to keep humans subdued.—Melissa Portell <mportell@s-cwis.unomaha.edu> John Carpenter's slow and deliberate immersion of the daunting and worrying fable of the corrupt, deceiving and indifferent economic, social and political society, that has wrapped itself around its people and who in turn have blindly accepted their fate.

They numb our senses without us feeling it. They control our lives without us realizing it. They live. Horror masterJohn Carpenter(Halloween, The Thing) directs this heart-pounding thriller. Aliens are systematically gaining control of the earth by masquerading as humans and lulling the public into submission. Humanity's last chance lies with a lone drifter who stumbles upon a harrowing discovery - a unique pair of sunglasses that reveal the terrifying and deadly truth. John Nada is a man without job who walks around a big American city trying to find something to do. He finally finds a job as a worker and a place to spend the nights, but one day something terrible happens to him. John discovers a pair of sun-glasses through which he can see the true face of people. Many persons in this city are in fact aliens (from the Andromeda) and most of them are important members of our society. They keep humans in ignorance and they rule our world as they like. Nada must find the rest of the men that know what's happening (those who made the strange sun-glasses) and join them in the fight against the aliens.—Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com> George Nada (Roddy Piper) is a homeless laborer who arrives in Los Angeles looking for work. The national economy seems to be in decline and the poor and middle class have been especially hard hit, living in shantytowns across the city. Nada listens for some seconds to some rambling street preacher (Raymond St. Jacques), but he dismisses his message and leaves when he notices that the police are coming.After visiting an employment office that has no job opportunities for him, Nada eventually finds work on an L.A. construction site. One of the workers, Frank Armitage (Keith David), is suspicious of Nada, especially when Nada follows him after work. He confronts him angrily, but realizes Nada's just looking for a meal and a place to sleep so he takes him to a local shantytown where most of the workers live. After eating at the soup kitchen and spending the night, he notices odd behavior at the small church across the street; a police helicopter hovers over the church and shantytown and a few of the people from the church race out, looking at the copter with dark sunglasses. Investigating, Nada discovers that the church's soup kitchen is a front: inside, the loud ""choir practice"" is a recording, scientific machinery fills a back room, and cardboard boxes are stacked everywhere, including some in a secret compartment that he stumbles across. The leader of the group (Peter Jason) is aware that Nada is onto them. The Street Preacher suddenly surprises him, probing Nada's face with his hands, indicating he's blind. When he notices that Nada has got rough hands because of all the physical labor he's done, he lets Nada go free.That night, a large police force arrives and surrounds the church, forcing the inhabitants to flee. The police then turn on the shantytown, destroying it with bulldozers and beating the blind minister of the church to death. Nada, Frank, and most of the inhabitants flee. Nada returns to the site the next day and investigates the church again, which has been emptied. He takes one of the boxes from the secret compartment and opens it in an alleyway. Expecting to find something valuable, he is a little disappointed to find it full of cheap-looking sunglasses, the same type the church staff wore when the helicopter flew over. He keeps one pair and hides the rest in a garbage can.When Nada later dons the glasses for the first time as he walks down a sidewalk on Rodeo Drive, he discovers that the world appears in shades of gray, with significant differences. He notices that a billboard now simply displays the word ""OBEY""; without them it advertises that Control Data Corporation which is ""creating a transparent computing environment."" Another billboard, which displays ""Come to the Caribbean"" emblazoned above a lovely woman lying on a beach, now displays the text: ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE."" At a nearby newsstand, all the printed material contains subliminal advertising in capital letters most of which read: ""OBEY, ""CONSUME"", ""SLEEP"", ""NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT"", and ""DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY"". While he stares disbelievingly at a magazine containing the subliminal messages, a man walks up. When Nada looks at him with the glasses, he sees a strange humanoid with bulging eyes and mottled skin. When Nada removes the glasses, the man looks like a white, male human. The man gets in his car and drives off while the owner of the newsstand approaches Nada, telling him to move on. Nada sees that paper money the man holds bears the words ""THIS IS YOUR GOD.""Nada soon discovers that many people around him are actually the same type of humanoids. Most of them are wearing expensive clothing resembling wealthy-looking businessmen and women. When Nada enters a local grocery store and insults one of them, the elderly lady speaks through her wristwatch, muttering about his location and the face that he ""can see."" Nada runs out of the store and into an alley where two humanoid policemen suddenly arrive. The two ""policemen"" ask where Nada got the sunglasses and he refuses to answer them. Aware that they intend to kill him, Nada escapes, killing both policemen. He steals a police shotgun. While evading the police, he stumbles into a local bank filled with humanoids. Realizing that the jig is up, he proclaims, ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubblegum."" A shooting spree ensues as Nada opens fire, firing on all the humanoids that he sees. After killing many of them, one of the humanoids sees him and disappears after twisting a dial on his wristwatch. Fleeing the bank and into a nearby parking garage, he forces a woman (Meg Foster) at gunpoint to take him to her house in the Hollywood Hills.At the woman's house, Nada takes off the glasses to rest. Rubbing the bridge of his nose, he remarks: ""wearin' these glasses makes you high, but, oh, you come down hard."" Nada tries to convince the woman, whose name is Holly Thompson, about what is happening, but she remains skeptical. When Nada lets his guard down after Holly tells him that she's an executive at a local TV station, she tricks him into turning on the TV set and suddenly pushes him through her window. He falls hard down the hilly slope below her house. He leaves behind his pair of sunglasses, however, for her. Without putting them on, Holly calls the police.The next morning, Nada sneaks back to the construction site to talk over with Frank what he discovered. Seeing Nada as a wanted man for the shooting spree, Frank is initially uninterested in his story. Now a fugitive with no one to turn to, Nada returns to the alley where he disposed of the rest of the sunglasses. Nada recovers the box by breaking into a garbage truck that nearly carries it away. Just then, Frank shows up with money, Nada's wages from the construction job he'd never gotten a chance to collect. Seeing that Frank is human, Nada tries to persuade him to put on a pair of the sunglasses, but Frank refuses, not wanting to get involved and telling Nada that he has a family back in Detroit that he wants to keep out of trouble too. Determined to convince Frank, the two engage in a long and violent hand-to-hand fight (lasting nearly 10 minutes of the movie) as Nada attempts to force Frank to put on the sunglasses. When Nada finally subdues Frank and finally puts on the glasses, Frank sees the humanoid aliens around him as well. Nada states: ""Partner, life's a bitch... and this one's in heat!""Frank joins Nada as they check into a local fleabag hotel and get in contact with the group from the church. They learn that a meeting is being held at a local community center later that evening. The community group listens to a seminar in the background introducing radical ideas. For example, the humanoid aliens are blamed for increased carbon dioxide and methane emissions ""They are turning our atmosphere into their atmosphere"" and quickly using up the planet's resources. Holly returns, claiming to now believe Nada, and delivers some information to the rebels about a possible location to where the aliens are broadcasting the subliminal messages.At the meeting, they learn that the aliens' primary method of control is a signal being sent out on television, which is why the general public cannot see the aliens for what they are. An unknown but brilliant inventor has created a lens called the Hofmann lens. The lens shows the world as it really is. The sunglasses, which are also available as contact lenses, interfere with the aliens' hypnotic signal. Nada and Frank are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses. Nada then has a talk with Holly who tells him that after their encounter when he left behind his sunglasses, she put them on and hid them which is how she now believes him. Suddenly, Nada and Holly's conversation is cut short at the hideout is raided by the police, who shoot to kill. Some of the resistance members flee outside while the police (a team of both human and aliens) are gunning people down indiscriminately.Nada and Frank escape into an alley behind the building and get away with the help of one of the wristwatch devices that teleports them to a mysterious underground facility. They find themselves in a network of underground passages under the city that link hidden parts of the alien society including a high-tech portal for space travel. Through the passages they find the aliens are throwing a party for their human collaborators. The speaker at the podium informs everyone about the raid that just took place at the resistance's headquarters. Nada and Frank meet one of the homeless drifters (George 'Buck' Flower) whom they previously met in the workers shantytown, whom is one of the many human collaborators working with the aliens. Thinking that they have been recruited as he has, the Drifter shows them around the underground facility.The Drifter leads Nada and Frank to the studio of a local TV station, Cable 54, and the source of the aliens' signal. Nada and Frank pull out their pistols and kill all the alien guards, intending to shut down the hidden signal the aliens are using. The Drifter escapes by teleporting himself and sounds the alarm. Arming themselves with assault rifles from the dead guards, Nada and Frank decide to get to the roof of the building to shut down the signal to make the world aware of the aliens among them. But aware that they will not survive, even if they succeed in shutting down the signal, Nada and Frank know that this is a suicide mission.Nada and Frank engage in a gun battle with the guards in the studio hallways and offices. Holly, who works at the station, is found by Frank and Nada and she leads them up to the roof of the building where the dish is broadcasting. Making it to a stairway, Nada runs up to the roof expecting that Holly and Frank are behind him. Suddenly, Holly pulls out a gun, presses it against Frank's temple, and kills him. Through the special contact lenses that he is wearing, Nada notices the broadcasting antenna. Holly gets to the roof, then takes aim at Nada. Here, Nada finally realizes that Holly is yet another human collaborator with the aliens (and possibly the one who led the police to the rebels hiding spot). Then, a police helicopter appears where the aliens aboard order Nada to step away from the broadcasting antenna.Aware that he is a dead man no matter what he does, Nada uses a hidden sleeve pistol and kills Holly. Nada then turns his attention back to the broadcasting antenna. Nada is immediately shot and fatally wounded by alien police marksmen in the hovering helicopter, but manages to get one final shot from his small pistol and destroys the broadcasting antenna. As a last dying defiant act, Nada gives the aliens in the hovering helicopter ""the finger"" as he lies dying on the roof of the building next to Holly's dead body, and the ruins of the broadcasting dish.With the signal now destroyed, people around L.A. and the rest of the country are surprised to discover aliens in their midst... seeing them on TV, chatting with them at the bar, meeting with them at the office... and even having sex with them."

Dex is enraged by the wasted lives, and his failure to identify the murderer.Dex returns to his office and ransacks the bookshelves in a tantrum, then soothes himself with a drink from Hal's whiskey bottle. Remembering that Hal poured the liquor into a coffee mug before giving it to him on the afternoon of Nick's death, Dex telephones his friend and orders him to come to the office. When Hal arrives, he refuses to taste the whiskey and Dex realizes he is the killer. Hal explains his plans to publish Nick's novel under his own name. He was obliged to kill Gail, and poison Dex, because they knew about 'Out of Whack' and were likely to expose his deception. A fight ensues, and Dex shoots Hal in the chest. Hal plunges through the window to his death.In the end, back at the police station (in black-and-white), Dex concludes his story to the investigating detectives. The final shot shows Dex walking out of the police station along a long hallway to meet his fate.(One interpretation is that he might have died right there at the station and is walking down the station hallway to the light of Heaven.)"

Cinema Paradiso,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A filmmaker recalls his childhood when falling in love with the pictures at the cinema of his home village and forms a deep friendship with the cinema's projectionist. A boy who grew up in a native Sicilian Village returns home as a famous director after receiving news about the death of an old friend. Told in a flashback, Salvatore reminiscences about his childhood and his relationship with Alfredo, a projectionist at Cinema Paradiso. Under the fatherly influence of Alfredo, Salvatore fell in love with film making, with the duo spending many hours discussing about films and Alfredo painstakingly teaching Salvatore the skills that became a stepping stone for the young boy into the world of film making. The film brings the audience through the changes in cinema and the dying trade of traditional film making, editing and screening. It also explores a young boy's dream of leaving his little town to foray into the world outside.—Clarisse P. In post-World War II Sicily, at the small village of Giancaldo, the fatherless eight-year-old boy, Salvatore ""Totò"" Di Vita, befriends Alfredo, the grizzled projectionist of the local Cinema Paradiso, and gains a mentor, and the father he never had. As the wide-eyed boy becomes enchanted by the dazzling world of the movies, growing up with the everlasting characters ofAkira Kurosawa,Jean Renoir,John Wayne,Charles Chaplin, and everything in between, his vivid dreams start taking shape, even though the village priest, Father Adelfio, never misses an opportunity to censor films. But, after thirty long years of absence, the death of a dear one forces silver-haired Salvatore, now a prominent film director, to reconnect with his old hometown, and his faded, celluloid-scented childhood memories. Can he remember the taste of youth's first kiss?—Nick Riganas A man receives news from his aging mother in a little town that someone he once knew has passed away. A beautiful story unfolds about the man's childhood friendship with an old man who was the projectionist at the local theater. Their bond was one that contained many highlights and tragedies, and shaped the way for a young boy to grow and move out of his rundown village to pursue a dream.—Tam Bui <tbui@bjt.net> DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSIONBeginning at the end, the movie opens with Salvatore's mother trying to inform him of the death of Alfredo. Salvatore, a filmmaker who has not been home since his youth, leaves Rome immediately to attend the funeral. Through flashbacks we watch Salvatore in his youth, in a post WWII town in Southern Italy. As a young boy he is called Toto and he has a strong affinity for the cinema. Toto often sneaks into the movie theater when he shouldn't and harasses the projectionist, Alfredo, in attempts to get splices of film that are cut out by the church because they contain scenes of kissing. Toto has a younger sister and war widowed mother who often struggle due to the loss of Toto's father. Toto is banned from the movie theater by his mother when his film bits accidentally catch fire and nearly kill his sister along with burning up the only picture Toto has of his father along with other family photographs. Eventually he sneaks his way back and forms a father-son bond with Alfredo, despite Alfredo's reluctancy, Toto even learns how to run the projector. Meanwhile one of the townspeople wins the lotto and becomes a rich man. One day in the cinema, after Toto leaves to watch the movie with his friends below, the film catches fire in the projector and knocks Alfredo out. Young Toto rescues Alfredo from death in the fire, unfortunately the cinema burns down and Alfredo loses his sight. Lucky the lotto-lucky-townsman pays to have a new cinema put up. Since Toto already knows how to run the projector he works with Alfredo in the projection room. Some years pass and Salvatore is now a young man. A rich girl, Elena, comes to town and Salvatore and his friends vie for her attention. Salvatore films her and begins to fall in love. Alfredo advises him to steer clear of love because it only causes pain. Despite his warning, Salvatore confesses his love to Elena, who's reply is that she does not, but she could. So he waits, every night outside her house for her reply. One day he gives up and trudges home depressed and upset only to soon discover that Elena does love him in return. They begin a passionate romance, like that of two newlyweds. Unfortunately, Elena's father doesn't approve and so he takes Elena away. All summer they try to meet, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. On one particular day he tries to reach her and she him but their paths don't cross. As we discover later, Alfredo catches Elena and convinces her to leave Salvatore alone out of love. Salvatore then wanders without purpose and eventually joins the military due to the requirement by Italian law that all male youths serve for a period of time in the army. When he returns to his home town, all has changed and he cannot adjust. Alfredo urges him to leave and tells him that if he were to ever return, he would not see him. Obviously Salvatore goes on to become a successful filmmaker. As he wanders the remains of his town after the funeral he sees a vision of Elena just as she was when they were young; he realizes it is Elena's daughter and follows her to Elena's home where he sees that she married one of Salvatore's childhood friends, a dunce when Salvatore knew him. He confronts Elena and they meet. They talk and she reveals to him that she didn't miss out on their fateful reunion but rather that Alfredo convinced her to leave. Salvatore realizes what a role Alfredo had in shaping his life and that Alfredo knew that if he stayed with Elena he would have no chance to pursue his love of film and so by going to Rome to become a filmmaker he sacrificed his love for Elena. Salvatore and Elena say farewell and go their separate ways. Salvatore returns to Rome with a can of film left to him by Alfredo. It contains all the splices of the kissing scenes from Salvatore's youth."
Bloodsport,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092675/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"""Bloodsport"" followsFrank Dux, an American martial artist serving in the military, who decides to leave the army to compete in a martial arts tournament in Hong Kong where fights to the death can occur. Frank Dux has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament, where participants are seriously injured, even killed. Frank decides to go despite being told by his superiors in the army that he can't because they need him. Two army officers are sent to get him and the trail leads to Hong Kong but Frank eludes them. While Frank advances, he knows that he may have to face Chong Li, the defending champion, who has killed a few participants.—rcs0411@yahoo.com When a martial arts-trained soldier learns of an underground fight-to-the-death tournament through the last words of his dying sensei, he must travel to Hong Kong while avoiding capture from his military superiors so he can fight his way to the top in the deadly competition to honor the legacy of his sensei.—Turi Haim Frank Dux has entered the ""kumite"", an illegal underground martial-arts competition where serious injury and even death are not unknown. In town for the fight are a number of fighters (all with different styles), as well as a journalist determined to get her story. Chong Li, a particularly ruthless and vicious fighter is the favourite, but then again Dux has never fought him before.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Frank Dux is an American martial artist. His former teacher in the martial arts, gives him an invitation to ""The Kumite"", the secret martial arts tournament where only the world's best fighters are invited. Frank shows up in Hong Kong for the tournament, but his CO's in the US Army are right on his tail. Frank wins match after match, and shows promise that he may be the first person from the Western Hemisphere to win the tournament, until the defending champion gets his hands on Frank's friend, Jackson, and injures him in the Quarter Finals. Now Frank faces an uphill climb. His friend is hurt, the US Army is on his tail, and he is on the verge of making martial arts history. The question is, will he?—David Hammond (dickclarkfan1@yahoo.com) The movie begins with montages of various hopeful competitors training and practicing their fighting techniques. Interspersed with these montages are shots of the arena where the Kumite will be held. The hosts of the Kumite are rehearsing pageantry and preparing the arena for proper use.Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), an army captain at his base, is summoned to a meeting with his colonel before going on furlough. The colonel has found out he plans to travel to Hong Kong while on furlough, and Dux's superiors want to stop him from entering the Kumite, in part because the Kumite is an illegal, underground fight. It is not sanctioned by world martial arts organizations, due to its particularly violent nature. Fatalities, though uncommon and frowned on, are considered part of the risk. Dux stages a daring escape from his base, going AWOL to travel to Hong Kong. The Army dispatches two MPs, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to find Dux and bring him back.Dux first visits the home of his mentor and teacher, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). He is greeted warmly by Mrs. Tanaka (Lily Leung), who goes to tell her husband that Dux has arrived. Waiting in the living room, Dux becomes lost in thought looking at Tanaka's katana (samurai sword). He begins reminiscing about his long relationship with Tanaka: As a youth, Frank fell in with two unruly boys who made him come with them to try and steal the sword. The boys ran at the sound of people approaching, but Frank started to put the sword back on its stand when he was found by Tanaka and his son, Shingo. Tanaka admonished Dux for stealing, and Dux protested he wasn't going to steal it. Tanaka slices the visor off of Dux's baseball cap and is impressed that Dux doesn't flinch. Meeting with Dux's parents, he convinces them to let him train Frank in martial arts. At first, the young Dux becomes frustrated that he is only learning some of Tanaka's knowledge while Shingo is being trained far more intensively. Shingo is being groomed to represent his family in the kumite as an adult. But tragedy strikes when Shingo dies as a young adult. A heartbroken Tanaka, having already lost his first family in Hiroshima, chooses to stop all training, believing his family is ended. Dux makes an impassioned plea for Tanaka to train him fully, to compete in the Kumite on Shingo's behalf, to honor both Shingo and Tanaka. Montages are shown of this training, becoming more and more intensive, until at the pinnacle, Dux is able to ignore pain and operate while blindfolded as if still fully sighted.Dux goes to see Tanaka, who is now an old man and showing the infirmities of old age. He tells Dux that when he fights, Tanaka's spirit will be there, fighting beside him, and in the Kumite, he will need it.Dux arrives at the hotel where most of the Kumite participants are staying. He meets Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) playing a karate video game. The two play the game together and start to bond as friends and as fellow Americans. Jackson is a big, brawny, beer-swilling brawler with a scruffy beard. Not knowing anything of Dux, he likes the smaller man and treats him almost like a 'little brother.'Also at the same hotel, an American journalist named Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) is questioning two men about the kumite. She knows it is being held in Hong Kong over the next three days and is trying to get a story on it. The two men don't acknowledge even knowing what the kumite is.Helmer and Rawlins arrive at the Tanaka home to find out if Dux was there and if the Tanakas knew he was going to Hong Kong. Mrs. Tanaka says that Dux came by to pay his respects, but she doesn't know if he was heading to Hong Kong. Rawlins is sure she does know and tries to press her, but Helmer steps in, simply thanking Mrs. Tanaka for speaking to them.Dux and Jackson go to check in at their hotel and are told that a Victor Lin is looking to speak to them. Lin (Ken Siu) comes across Dux and Jackson at that moment and introduces himself, saying he is one of the Kumite agents and he's been assigned to assist them with their stay in Hong Kong. He leads them through the streets of the city to a run-down, seedy part of the city (the long-since demolished Kowloon Walled City or ""no man's land"", as Lin calls it), explaining that the Kumite is being held in Hong Kong at the permission of the ""Triad,"" the Chinese Mafia. At the entrance to a back alley being guarded by several tall, burly, stoic men. Victor speaks to them in Mandarin, and the tallest of the guards, their leader, lets them all through with a condescending air toward the American foreigners. Victor leads them through the alley to the secret arena where the Kumite will be held. The first step is to properly register for the Kumite. Participation is by invitation only. As Jackson and Dux present their invitations, the officials stop and are very dubious of Dux, because his invitation lists him as being part of the Tanaka Clan. Clearly they know of Senzo Tanaka and are unwilling to believe, at face value, that Dux is a student of Tanaka's. They insist he prove this claim with a demonstration of the legendary ""Dim Mak"" pressure point strike. They show him where several bricks are stacked. To properly demonstrate the Dim Mak, Dux must shatter the bottom-most brick without damaging either of the two bricks stacked atop it. As all the other participants in the arena watch, Dux successfully demonstrates the Dim Mak. The officials accept Dux as authentic and complete his registration. The Kumite participants resume training and sparring, except for one-- a large, burly Korean man named Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) who is not impressed, warning Dux, ""Bricks don't hit back.""Helmer and Rawlins go to the Hong Kong police department and confer with Inspector Chen (Philip Chan). They give him a photo of Dux, explain that they are trying to stop him from competing in the Kumite, and they ask Chen to contact them if his men learn anything about Dux's whereabouts. Chen is very dismissive but tells the two MP's that he'll see what he can do.Back at the hotel, Dux and Jackson find Janice Kent trying to get a story on the Kumite from one of the participants, a Mid-Eastern fighter named Hossein (Bernard Mariano). Hossein and his friends are surly and condescending. Hossein is only willing to speak if he can take Janice to bed, a proposition she finds repulsive. Hossein is offended at her defiance and is about to slap her when Dux and Jackson intervene. Jackson is ready to melee, but Dux asks everyone if it's worth getting ejected from the Kumite over a woman. Despite Janice's indignant protests, Dux arranges an alternative contest-- he puts a coin in Hossein's hand and challenges him to close his hand into a fist around the coin before Dux can successfully snatch the coin out of his palm. Hossein is amused and overly cocky at the challenge, but the smirk is wiped off his face when Dux succeeds in grabbing the coin and replacing it with a different coin. Per the terms of the bet, Hossein and his friends have to leave Janice alone.Dux and Janice are talking as they take a walk, and Janice tells Dux about her ambition to get a story on the Kumite, which she describes as 'a cockfight, except with people.' Dux agrees to speak to Janice, and asks her to dinner in return.The first day of the Kumite arrives, and the opening pageantry is conducted and the host organization introduces itself, speaking about the traditional background of the contest.As the Kumite prepares for the first fight, Victor reminds Dux and Jackson that the contests are full-contact, and there are three ways to win-- knock the opponent out, knock them off the platform, or force the opponent to shout the word ""matte,"" which is a cry of surrender similar to saying 'Uncle.'The first-round bouts are conducted, showing several participants standing out as victorious and forces to be reckoned with -- a Polynesian fighter named Parades (Michel Qissi), a Chinese kung-fu fighter named Chuan Ip Mung (Dennis Chu), a big and burly Japanese Sumo fighter named Pumola (David Ho), a Muay Thai kickboxer named Paco (Paulo Tocha), Jackson, and Chong Li, who is the current champion. Chong Li exults in hearing the crowd cheer his name, and enjoys finishing his matches by maiming and crippling his opponents. He is notorious for having killed a participant at the last Kumite. Chong Li easily dispatches his opponent, breaking his own world record for the fastest knockout.Dux's first opponent is none other than Hossein. The Syrian fighter is eager for a little revenge, but Dux not only knocks him out, but proceeds to break Chong Li's new record for fastest knockout -- and Chong Li is noticeably angered.Helmer and Rawlins are eating lunch when Inspector Chen comes to see them. He's found out the name of the hotel Dux is staying at. Helmer and Rawlins confront Dux in the lounge there as he is talking with Jackson. They pull taser stun-guns and order him to come with them immediately. A football tackle by Jackson takes them down and gives Dux time to run. He leads them on an amusing chase scene, seemingly toying with them before giving them the slip.Dux meets with Janice that evening for dinner. He tells her a little about the Kumite, but insists she cannot truly understand it without seeing it-- and the Kumite doesn't allow just anyone in, even as spectators-- they are especially strict about keeping press out. Janice asks Dux to pull some strings to let her come in and watch. She even sleeps with him as an incentive (and because she likes him). In the morning he kisses her goodbye and tells her that he cannot get her inside. But Janice quickly finds another way of entry, going ""undercover"" posing as a date to a wealthy spectator.A number of Kumite bouts are shown, and Dux, Chong Li, Chuan Ip Mung, Pumola, and Paco stand out, eliminating various opponents. Chong Li fights Parades, whose longer reach lets him land various combination punches that jar Chong Li. But Chong Li adopts a counter-punching strategy and gets inside, landing brutal attacks that leave Parades completely dazed and stunned. Playing to the crowd, Chong Li executes a brutal stomping kick to his opponent's kneecap, breaking Parades' leg and presumably crippling him.More fights are shown, and more fighters are eliminated. Dux defeats Pumola by doing a split to get under Pumola's charge, and punching his groin. The crowd begins to chant Dux's name, which really gets Chong Li angry.Ray Jackson finds himself facing Chong Li. Jackson is remarkably confident and arrogant, and shrugs off warnings of caution from both Dux and Victor. Dux has noticed a weakness in Chong Li's fighting style-- Parades almost turned the tables on him by landing a stiff punch to Chong Li's belly. Dux advises Jackson to focus on punches to the stomach, and warns Jackson to stay away from Chong Li's right leg. Jackson brushes off the warnings and advice, saying he has everything under control.As the fight begins, Jackson pounds on Chong Li's head with several hammering blows that drive him to one knee. Jackson then turns away, thinking he has the fight in the bag, and plays to the crowd, trying to get them to chant his name the way they chant Chong Li's name. From ringside, Dux tries to call out to Jackson to focus on finishing Chong Li, who is still on one knee, nursing his bruises and recovering. But by the time Jackson turns back to face Chong Li, the burly Korean fighter has risen back to his feet and is ready to show the whole crowd what happens to people who try to make a mockery of him. Chong Li lands a devastating kick that turns the tide of battle in a heartbeat. Not satisfied with merely defeating Jackson, Chong Li lets his rage bubble to the surface and delivers a frighteningly brutal stomp to the head of his prone opponent, as Victor struggles to hold Dux back from intervening. Jackson is unconscious and bleeding profusely from his mouth as Chong Li pulls off Jackson's biker bandanna and claims it as a trophy, shaking it in front of Dux as a dire warning.At the hospital, Jackson is being examined by doctors. Dux speaks to the unconscious Jackson, telling him he's lucky to have such a hard head, which saved him from being permanently maimed. Dux vows to get revenge on Chong Li. Janice is there as well, and she is horrified at the personal vendetta. The two argue passionately outside the hospital. Dux points out Janice's career as a reporter, and she is trying to be the best she can be-- Dux is doing the same; to be the best fighter he can be. Seeing she cannot budge Dux, Janice resignedly shouts that she only hopes Dux doesn't end up in a similar state as Jackson-- or even worse, before storming off. Lin goes up to Dux and admonishes him to forget Janice, as well as Jackson's injury and also about revenge. Dux has the chance to become the first fighter from the Western hemisphere to ever win the Kumite, but he needs to have a clear head.Desperate to see Dux spared from grievous injury, Janice turns to Inspector Chen. Knowing that the Kumite is illegal under Hong Kong law, Janice hopes to see the police get involved in stopping the competition. Inspector Chen is again dismissive, until Janice gives him Dux's name.Riding a bus back to his hotel, Dux is haunted by memories of the bout and mistakenly thinks he sees Chong Li's reflection in the bus window, glaring at him.Walking through the back alley for the final rounds of competition, Dux finds he has to fight his way through a gauntlet of Inspector Chen's police officers. After getting past them, he finds Helmer and Rawlins waiting at the doors to the arena with Chen and Janice. Helmer and Rawlins have their taser stun-guns at the ready. Dux uses a trash can lid to deflect the taser darts and grabs their weapons away. Knowing they cannot take Dux hand to hand, Helmer disgustedly enters the arena with Rawlins and Janice to observe the final bouts, hoping they do not have to scrape Dux up off the floor.In the arena, the officials are unaware of what is going on outside-- only that as a result of the melee, Dux is extremely late in showing up. They are just about to disqualify him when Dux enters.Dux's semifinal match is against Paco. As the fight begins, Paco extends his fists, motioning for Dux to touch knuckles with him. Warily, Dux finally does so, and is hit by a cheap shot from Paco. Recovering, Dux wades into battle and knocks Paco out.Chong Li's semi-final opponent is Chuan Ip Mung. Chuan gives Chong Li the stiffest resistance he's encountered in the Kumite, but even he cannot withstand the power of Chong Li's blows. Chong Li has Chuan supine and barely conscious on the ground, and starts to play to the crowd. But then, looking to send a message to Dux, Chong Li grabs Chuan's head and brutally snaps his neck. The crowd falls completely silent as the referee feels for breath and looks at Chong Li in appalled shock. Chuan is dead.The officials all stand and turn their backs to Chong Li, facing the wall and bowing their heads in a moment of silence. To Chong Li's disappointment the whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, follow suit. Chong Li warns Dux that he is next, and Dux just glares back before joining the rest of the crowd in the moment of silence. Disgusted at their abandonment of him as a champion, Chong Li gives them all a final dismissive wave and walks off the platform.As Chong Li prepares for the final bout, his trainer (Wilson Lee) carefully and stealthily slips a small chunk of a chalky substance into the waistband of his trunks. (Hinted to be cocaine but not stated definitively)Dux and Chong Li step onto the platform for the final bout to determine the Kumite's champion. Chong Li points to Jackson's bandanna, which he has tied around his calf, saying he plans to break Dux like he did Dux's friend in return for Dux's breaking his record. Dux stares back unafraid.The bout begins and Dux quickly seizes initiative. He takes control following the advice he tried to give Jackson, focusing on repeated punches and kicks to Chong Li's stomach and watching for kicks from Chong Li's right leg. He knocks Chong Li down, staggering him. On one knee, using his body to shield the action, Chong Li carefully removes the chalky object from his trunks and crushes it into a powder in his hand. Rising to his feet, he throws a punch that falls well short of his mark but, unseen by everyone else, flings the powder into Dux's eyes. Aside from his vision being completely clouded over, Dux appears to fall into a near stupor. The tables are turned and Chong Li takes the opportunity to enjoy beating Dux from pillar to post.On the mat, screaming in frustration, Dux suddenly clears his mind and appears to go into a meditative trance. Flashbacks are shown of his training with Tanaka, including training where he is blindfolded and learns to operate through his other senses as if he were fully sighted. Dux blocks a punch to his head and throws a ground side kick to Chong Li's stomach. Rising to his feet, Dux begins to step carefully around the arena, but always able to fend off Chong Li's attacks and land more blows to his stomach. Chong Li tries to throw Dux off by pushing the referee into him, but Dux, grabbing a handful of the ref's tunic, recognizes the ploy and carefully eases the referee behind him. He takes control of the match, hammering Chong Li's stomach and then going up to the head with leaping, spinning wheel kicks that knock the burly Chong Li completely for a loop, spilling him to the mat.Dux refuses to settle for a mere knockout. He needs to establish absolute dominance-- meaning even Chong Li himself must declare it to the whole crowd. Dux grabs Chong Li's head and gradually twists his neck, shouting, ""Say it!"" He twists Chong Li's neck harder until it is clear that his neck will snap if he doesn't comply. With his very life on the line, Chong Li defeatedly shouts 'matte,' and the crowd goes wild as the referee gestures to signal Dux's victory.The closing ceremony shows the officials presenting Dux with a beautifully crafted Japanese katana with words of praise. The whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, applaud as Dux looks up to the ceiling and says quietly, ""This is for you, Shidoshi.""Dux and Janice visit Jackson at the hospital. Jackson has regained consciousness and is convalescing. He is notably impressed as Dux's victory-- forcing Chong Li to submit, no less-- but jokingly warns that Dux might have to fight him next time. Dux and Jackson give an emotional handshake, their bond having strengthened to near blood-brothers.Helmer and Rawlins are waiting at the airport in front of a plane to take Dux back to the United States. They wait, and finally they are convinced that Dux has given them the slip yet again. Suddenly they hear a whistle behind them and turn to see Dux just inside the plane's boarding doorway, telling them to hurry up. The two MP's are grudgingly amused as they board the plane.Just as Dux is about to re-enter the plane, a cab pulls up and Janice steps out. Looking up at Dux, she gives him the Chinese covered-fist salute. The camera freezes on Dux returning the salute and bowing his head to her. Captions proceed to give Dux's career fight stats in the Kumite over several years, saying he established four records that were still standing at the time of the movie's release, and that he retired undefeated, before establishing his own martial arts school. Fade out as the credits begin to roll."

However, one member, a widow named Elizabeth Pearce (Dyan Cannon), shows a liking to him.When the current members meet Jack, who builds low-income housing in more upscale neighborhoods, his application to join is rejected. The rejection is borne out of his oafish personality and an earlier confrontation with Bushwood's snobbish president (and Miffy's father) Chandler Young's (Robert Stack) wife. Cynthia Young (Dina Merrill) had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jack to build his housing complex away from her neighborhood, but her less-than-subtle snobbery leads Jack to chase Cynthia with a bulldozer. It's actions like these that build a divide between Jack and Kate.Meanwhile, Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) returns, this time as the club's majority share owner, and while he admires Jack, he prefers to stay out of the way Jack's business and of the club's day-to-day operations.The elitist members of Bushwood reject Jack's membership application and pull strings to suspend his housing operation. In retaliation, Jack buys the majority stock to Bushwood from Ty and turns it into an amusement park. Chandler, incensed at the thought of a mere ""nouveau-riche"" individual getting the better of him, hires Captain Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) (who code-names Chandler Mrs. Esterhaus), a shell-shocked mercenary operating out of a lunch wagon, to ""discourage"" Jack from building any more structures on Bushwood property. The bumbling Everett decides to use explosive golf balls to do this.Meanwhile, Chandler uses his lawyers and connections to shut down Jack's housing construction site. Webb suggests that the dispute should be resolved like gentlemen, by facing each other in a golf match. If Chandler wins, Jack loses his construction site and the country club, and if Jack wins, he keeps the Bushwood and the housing project.At the climatic golf match, despite Jack's poor performance early in the match, with luck he ties the match before the final hole. However, during the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt, while Chandler faces a simple 2 foot putt. Using advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to use spiritual chanting and the adage ""be the ball"" to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy 2 foot putt to tie the match. Meanwhile, Everett, who foolishly shoots himself in the buttocks with a poison dart, fails to eliminate Jack as a gopher (the same mischievous gopher from the first film) steals his explosive ball. The mischievous gopher replaces Chandler's ball with the explosive ball, and as his family encouragingly crowds around him as he taps in his final swing, the ball bursts and Jack wins the match.Though Kate is embarrassed by her father's actions, she is still loyal to him, as evidenced when she commiserates to Miffy, who suggests that she change her last name from Hartounian to Hart. Bewildered at the thought of turning her back on her family name, Kate turns her back on Miffy and makes up with her father. Also, Jack finally asks Elizabeth out on a date, and she accepts."
Young Einstein,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096486/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Albert Einstein turns the science community upside down with his discoveries including a formula to put bubbles back in beer and rock n' roll. Albert Einstein is the son of a Tasmanian apple farmer, who discovers the secret of splitting the beer atom to put the bubbles back into beer. When Albert travels to Sydney to patent his invention he meets beautiful French scientist Marie Curie, as well as several unscrupulous types who try to take advantage of the naive genius and his invention.—Wiki Yahoo Seriousplays the lead role as Albert Einstein, a Tasmanian youth growing up on his parent's apple farm where he spends most of his time listening to music and thinking about the universe. When young Albert falls out of an apple tree and lands on a plank, causing a box of apples to fall on his head, he comes up with his first scientific theory: every action has an equal and opposite reaction.His father (Peewee Wilson) decides show him how to brew beer but, through all his successes, he can't seem to give his beer a proper head full of bubbles. In an attempt to please his father, and further his scientific prowess with his newly discovered formula, E=mc2, Albert succeeds in putting bubbles into beer, with catastrophic consequences. Doing so required the splitting of a beer atom and it causes the entire beer shack to explode. However, Albert's father proclaims him a genius and sends him off to mainland Australia to patent his idea as his mother (Su Cruickshank) bids him a tearful farewell.After weeks of travel, Albert catches a train bound for Sydney where he meets pompous Preston Preston (John Howard), head of the patent office, and Marie Curie (Odile Le Clezio), a Nobel Prize winning student of physics from France. Though Preston is less than impressed with Albert's rustic appearance, Marie is tickled pink by his theories on the universe. Once in Sydney, Albert proceeds to the patent office where he is quickly dismissed for not having a proper invention to patent. Albert decides to find a place to stay while he works on his theories and finds haven in a run down hotel, which turns out to be a brothel. There, he comes up with the theory of rock n roll and fashions his own electrical violin, explaining his idea scientifically. He brings it to the patent office as a genuine invention but is dismissed yet again.He meets up with Marie at the University of Sydney and talks more about his theories, getting kicked out of her class in the process for showing his formula. They spend more and more time together, discussing the theory of relativity while Albert comes up with new inventions. Marie implores Preston to give Albert a job at the patent office which Albert soon finds confusing while Preston confesses his love for Maria, along with his overall disdain for Einstein. Maria is less than impressed. Preston then finds Alberts formula for splitting atoms and decides to take it for himself and places Albert in a mental institution for mad scientists to keep him out of the way. He appears to fit in, discussing his theories with the other inmates despite receiving harsh treatment from the staff.After discovering what Preston intends to do with the formula (create the largest beer keg - essentially an atom bomb - in the world), Marie rushes to the institution to find Albert, disguised as his father. She finds him in the mens showers and, after a tender moment, tells Albert about Prestons plot. Dejected at first, Albert hatches an idea for escape using his theory of electrical rock n roll. He builds a new electrical guitar and hooks it up to the institutions main lines, shorting out all the circuits and opening all the doors. He escapes with the other inmates after avoiding a masculine nurse (Russell Cheek) and saving a pie full of kittens from a mad cook (Roger Ward).Then he crashes the Science Academy Awards where Preston has displayed his beer keg hanging from a hot air balloon. Albert manages to save everyone from certain doom using his electrical guitar to suck out all the energy within the bomb - a feat that would kill any normal man, but Albert is far from normal. He reunites with Marie and is congratulated by none other than Charles Darwin (Basil Clarke) himself. The government approaches Albert and asks him for the formula for splitting the atom, which Albert agrees to hand over. Marie questions his decision but Albert innocently states, If you cant trust the governments of the world, who can you trust? Albert takes Marie home with him to Tasmania where he sings and plays his guitar to swooning fans."

Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain.

Even after trying to convince the authorities of what really happened with her family, nobody believes in her version of the history and they decide to place her in the institute, so that she rests and relaxes a little bit. The hospital is commanded by a brilliant and strange psychiatrist, Dr. Channard, who has been looking for the key for another dimension for a long time. The only person who believes in Kirsty is a young and kind assistant of Dr. Channard, called Kyle MacRae. Following Kirsty's version of the story, Channard put his hands on the bloodstained mattress where her stepmother Júlia died, Channard decides to resurrect her, killing his patients and offering them as food for Júlia. She returns without skin, and she decides to help Channard to bring the forces of the evil, but the plans of the two will be disturbed by Kirsty, who wants to end at once with the cenobites, and for Kyle, who doesn't want to see Kirsty being hurt...—Ary Luiz Dalazen Jr. <ajr@fortalnet.com.br> The movie opens with Captain Elliott Spencer (Doug Bradley) playing with the Lament Configuration box, only to have it send him to Hell and transform him to the Cenobite ""Pinhead"". Flash forward to the present, where Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) has been remanded to the Channard Institute, a psychiatric hospital, and is questioned by Homicide Detective Bronson (Angus MacInnes). After the police search the house where her father, Larry, her stepmother Julia and her uncle, Frank, all died, they stumble upon the bloody mattress Julia had died upon (from the first film) and bag it as evidence. Kirsty meets Dr. Phillip Channard (Kenneth Cranham) and his assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope) and she tells her story. Before leaving, Kirsty begs Bronson to burn the mattress as it is the only means of bringing Julia back from Hell. Channard talks to Bronson privately.During her first night, Kirsty has trouble falling asleep when she comes across a young girl named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), institutionalized for six months and who has a knack for solving puzzles. Kirsty continues to hear voices and receives a bloody message written on the wall from a skinless human whom she believes is her father: ""I AM IN HELL. HELP ME."" Kirsty explains the entire story to Channard after she expresses to Kyle that her father may still be alive.Channard steals the mattress and takes it to his home. Kyle sneaks to his house to find that Channard is obsessed with the Lament Configuration box and the portal to Hell. Kyle watches from behind a curtain as Channard brings back a masochistic patient from the ward, handing him a straight razor. The patient slashes himself several times, bleeding onto the mattress. After a few moments, a skinless body emerges from the mattress, draining the patient. The body in the mattress is actually Julia, whom Channard is trying to resurrect with the promise of learning about the afterlife. Channard hides Julia in his attic and brings her more victims, binding them to the ceiling so Julia can drain them of their blood and reconstruct her body. After a few victims, she has much of her skin back.Kyle informs Kirsty about what he saw and that he now believes her. They go to Channard's house together, as Kirsty finds a picture of Spencer before he'd become Pinhead. Kyle runs into Julia: at first he has no idea who she is. Julia locks herself with Kyle in Channard's attic, where the corpses of Julia's victims hang rotting. Julia approaches him and envelopes him with her arms. Weak-willed and unable to resist her charms, Kyle then he realizes she is the skinless, monstrous thing that destroyed the mental patient on the mattress. Kyle panics and tries to escape, but Julia's grip prevents him from doing so. Julia makes as if she's kissing Kyle, and works him through a process of sucking him dry. Julia and Kirsty finally meet again, and Julia smacks Kirsty as Channard brings another patient: Tiffany.Tiffany is not to be another of Julia's victims, but is merely being used to open the puzzle box so Channard can experience Hell. The tunnels of Hell are opened and the Cenobites are released, but Pinhead stops the others from killing Tiffany; he notes that it is not merely her solution to the box that opened the gateway, but Channard's. Channard and Julia have both entered the tunnels themselves and begin to explore. Kirsty wakes up and, after seeing what has happened, heads for Hell with the box. When she arrives there, Pinhead finds her and changes the configuration of the box into a long, diamond shape that appears unsolvable. Kirsty takes the puzzle with her, seeking Tiffany to solve it.Julia introduces Channard to the box's realm, which is a series of pathways that form a strange maze. Leviathan, the god of the realm, represented by a much larger version of the puzzle box in the diamond configuration rotates at the center of the maze, sending black beams that cover the entire maze. Channard sees the horror of Leviathan's Hell and realizes it's beyond his comprehension. When he tries to leave, Julia forces him into a much larger version of the box, where he endures unimaginable pain when his face is strung with wires and organic injection devices fill him with hideous fluids. He emerges from the box some time later, now a Cenobite and seemingly pleased by his new form. A large, slimy tentacle painfully grips the top of his head and becomes his new means of mobility.Kirsty eventually finds Tiffany, and they both try to find an exit. Kirsty sees her father's house, and runs in thinking her father might be inside, but it turns out to be Frank. He is the one who sent Kirsty the message, wanting Kirsty to join him. Frank presides over his own chamber of Hell where shrouded women taunt him, never allowing him any pleasure from them. He tries to attack Kirsty and she responds by starting a fire in the chamber, which also engulfs Frank, burning off his flesh. Julia enters with Tiffany, and Frank invites her to kiss him. Julia betrays him, ripping his heart out -- her revenge for Frank killing her. Kirsty and Tiffany escape the room. The girls try escape the maze but Julia catches them and grabs onto Tiffany. In the ensuing scuffle, Julia's flesh is torn whole from her body and she's blown down the tunnel as she screams, dropping the box.Kirsty and Tiffany make their escape back to the hospital, but the Channard Cenobite finds them and gives chase again. Kirsty encounters Pinhead, Butterball, Chatter, and the Female Cenobite. Kirsty gives Pinhead the picture of Elliot Spencer and reminds them that they were all human at one time, until the pain and pleasure of the box overwhelmed them. Channard arrives to capture Tiffany, while the remaining Cenobites all choose to protect Kirsty. Channard kills all the Cenobites (reverting them back to human form), using strange tentacles with sharp blades and turns Pinhead's face into Elliot. Elliot smiles at Kirsty and allows her to escape before succumbing to his death when Channard slits Elliot's throat.Tiffany decides to go back into Hell and finish what was started. Kirsty follows her, but understands that it's all a puzzle. Tiffany attempts to solve the puzzle, but Channard interferes and attacks both girls. Kirsty retreats. As Channard stalks Tiffany, Julia reappears and distracts him with a kiss, long enough for Tiffany to solve the puzzle. As he tries to kill Tiffany, Channard's tentacles become embedded in the floor and his mobility tentacle rips the top of his head off at the jaw. Tiffany falls over the edge, but Julia catches her and pulls her up (but not before it is revealed that Kirsty has disguised herself in Julia's skin). Both of them escape back to the hospital as the portal closes and they both leave the hospital.Some time later, two movers arrive to pack up all of Channard's belongings before one notices the bloodied mattress. It kills him as the second mover enters the room. A wooden pillar covered with bits of flesh hanging from hooks and chains rises up and spins around, showing the near-dead Cenobite Pinhead screaming (Geoffrey Portass) as well as ""Skinless"" Julia, before stopping. The last head (Little John) is revealed to be the same man from the first film, who ends the movie by asking: ""What is your pleasure, sir?"" (the similar line the first film ends with)."

Switching Channels,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096203/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A television news chief courts his anchorwoman ex-wife with an eleventh-hour story. Sully is the producer of a cable news network program. Christy is his ex-wife and best reporter. Her desire to quit the news business and marry Blaine, a sporting goods manufacturer comes as an innocent man is about to be executed. Sully's attempts to keep her in town and break up her upcoming marriage happen against the backdrop of a botched execution, a prison break and a possible pardon.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Having just returned from a much needed vacation to recharge her juices, Christy Colleran walks into the offices of the Chicago-based Satellite News Network (SNN), where she is a star on-air investigative reporter, to tell her boss, news director John Sullivan - Sully - that she is quitting. Sully also happens to be her ex-husband. Christy divorced Sully largely because she saw him as treating their relationship as news first, marriage second. She has also come to tell Sully that she is marrying New York sporting goods baron Blaine Bingham, the two who will be flying to New York City that afternoon to start their new life, and where Christy will work as a morning talk show host. Sully doesn't want to lose Christy, either as a reporter or a wife, and believes she truly will miss her investigative reporting life. Sully does whatever he can at least to delay Christy and Blaine's trip, long enough to persuade Christy to stay for good. His plan includes dangling a big story under her nose, namely getting an exclusive interview with Ike Roscoe, who is on death row and is scheduled to be executed at midnight. Ike admits to committing the murder of a police officer for which he was convicted, but that that officer was a drug dealer who sold to teenagers, including Ike's son, who died of a drug overdose. Ike did not know of him being a police officer, which may not have made any difference in his actions. Sully hopes that Christy's interview will lead to the hapless Governor issuing a pardon. They know Ike has been used as a pawn between the Governor and Roy Ridnitz, the state attorney who is running for Governor in the upcoming election. Regardless of if Christy is able to get the interview and if so what its effect is, she will have to decide if the thrill of the chase will change her mind about her upcoming more staid life.—Huggo Known as the best in the business, Christy Colleran, a news anchor and field reporter for Chicago-based Satellite News Network, does whatever it takes to get the story. Coming back from a much needed vacation, the stress which was negatively showing in her work, Christy surprises everyone with her two-part news: first, that she is immediately quitting her job, and second, that she is getting remarried in two days to New York sporting goods magnate, Blaine Bingham, who she met on that vacation. Both pieces of news don't sit well with the station's news director, her boss John L. Sullivan IV - Sully in more familiar circumstances - who also happens to be her ex-husband. Sully proceeds to do whatever he can to ensure that Christy doesn't leave as he wants her in his life in both a professional and personal capacity. While other tactics have only a partial effect in reaching his end goal, including assigning Karen Ludlow to many of what would have been her assignments, Christy who sees her nothing more than eye candy for the television cameras, what may do the job is him dangling the biggest story in years in front of her in asking her to get an exclusive interview with Ike Roscoe, the first person in decades in Illinois to be on death row, his execution to take place at 23:00 this evening. If Christy is able to get the interview and follow-up on the story, she will discover that Ike is being used as a pawn between the feckless Governor, and the ambitious District Attorney Roy Ridnitz, who is running against him. The questions then become if Sully's tactics work to show Christy both that news is in her blood and that he is the man suited to her mentality, Ike's life hanging in the balance in the process.—Huggo In this 1980s remake of 'His Girl Friday' (with elements of the play and film 'The Front Page') set in Chicago, Illinois, Satellite News Network (SNN) news director John L. ""Sully"" Sullivan, IV (Burt Reynolds), tells his best reporter and ex-wife, Christy Colleran (Kathleen Turner), to go on a vacation to get away from her stress-full job. As she checks into a Canadian resort for a three-week stay, Christy accidentally moves a candlestick, setting a credit card on fire. She apologizes to card owner, Blaine Bingham (Christopher Reeve), owner of the sporting goods company, Bingham Industries. A day or two later, Blaine rescues Christy after she loses her canoe paddle in the lake. Over the course of her vacation, Christy and Blaine fall in love.Later, Christy returns to Chicago with Blaine. Arriving at SNN studios, Blaine waits in the lobby as Christy reports to Sully, who orders her to go to the downtown jailhouse where convicted murderer Ike Roscoe (Henry Gibson) is awaiting execution by electric chair. Christy accuses Sully of always focusing on the news, like the volcano that erupted during their honeymoon. While Sully laughs, Christy announces she is quitting the TV station and marrying Blaine the day after tomorrow in New York City. Not wanting to let Christy leave him right away, Sully insists on meeting Blaine for an in-person interview.In the lobby, Sully says he would like to treat Blaine and Christy to lunch. Christy insists they need to leave to catch their flight to New York in just a few hours from now. However, Blaine says they could purchase tickets for a later flight and accepts Sully's lunch offer. Christy heads back to get her laptop, but Sully offers to go instead. Finding junior reporter, Siegenthaler (George Newbern), Sully orders him to purchase all available airplane seats departing Chicago for New York to prevent Christy and Blaine from leaving town.At the restaurant (a sports bar themed place complete with a boxing ring), Sully receives a call from Siegenthaler about the airline bookings. Not to let Christy become aware of his plan, Sully says into the receiver that Christy's replacement, Karen Ludlow (Laura Robinson), is doing a great job. Christy insists she is a better reporter than Karen Ludlow, but Sully affirms that Ludlow, not Christy, will cover Ike Roscoe's 12:01 a.m. electrocution that very night. When Blaine asks who Ike Roscoe is, Christy tells him that after Ike's son, Anthony, died from a drug overdose, Ike shot and killed the drug dealer. However, the dealer turned out to be an undercover police officer. Blaine asks why the Governor does not issue a pardon, but Sully and Christy believe the execution is a political issue, related to the Democratic primary contest between the Governor and Roy Ridnitz (Ned Beatty), the State's District Attorney who convicted Ike at trial. Sully suggests that if Christy were to have a poignant interview with Ike and for it to air on the evening news, the Governor might pardon him. Blaine sides with Sully in which he tells Christy that she needs to do the interview to save the man's life. Touched by Blaine's selflessness, Christy agrees, but on condition that Sully purchase equipment from Blaine's company for an SNN gym.Christy leaves the sports restaurant and meets her camera crew at the state prison. Warden Terwilliger (Ken James) denies her interview request, but Christy informs him she knows about the bribes he receives from prisoners to use his office for conjugal visits. Reluctantly, Terwilliger agrees.Meanwhile at SNN, Sully purchases exercise equipment while Blaine calls for airline tickets. Shocked that all flights are sold out, Blaine suggests he could get tickets on the 11:00 train. Determined to keep Christy in town, Sully finds Siegenthaler and tells him to book all the train tickets, as well as seats on helicopters and all other forms of public transportation. Afterward, Sully calls the mail room and orders that next week when the Bingham Industries shipment arrives, they should return it.Christy telephones Sully from the prison waiting room, letting him know that she got the interview with Ike. Blaine gets on the line with her and tells Christy he managed to purchase train tickets. Realizing he is too late, Sully calls Siegenthaler to stop the bookings. Afterward, Sully notices a book titled, 'You Can! You Will! Cure Your Height Phobia in 10 Easy Days,' in Blaine's briefcase. Blaine tells Sully and he has decided to get a picnic dinner with silver candlestick holders for the train. Now working on a new plan to keep Christy in town, Sully offers Siegenthaler as a guide for Blaine to the silver store, but tells Siegenthaler to take Blaine to a city skyscraper (aware that his acrophobia will trigger a reaction). Sully further orders SNN's front desk security officer, Abigail (Jackie Richardson), to thoroughly search Blaine if he ever returns.Siegenthaler takes Blaine downtown. Blaine gets on the glass elevator with Siegenthaler, but as the elevator rises, Blaine has a crippling anxiety attack and places his foot on the emergency stop button.Meanwhile, State's Attorney Roy Ridnitz arrives at his campaign headquarters and learns about Christy's interview with Ike Roscoe. He orders Warden Terwillger to cancel the interview. However, Terwillger catches up to Christy, who tells her cameraman to start filming. Terwillger relents and lets them inside the cell block.During Ike's interview, he mentions that today is Harold Houdini's birthday, and when he was a practicing magician, he would perform Houdini's tricks with his son. Upon Christy's request to perform Anthony's favorite trick, Ike makes Christy's pen disappear from his hand, then reappear in her pocket. Later, Ike is escorted into his cell and pulls Christy's pen cartridge from his mouth. Outside the prison, Christy walks to the nearby criminal courts building, followed by fellow rival television reporters Zaks (Barry Flatman), Tillinger (Ted Simonett), and Carvalho (Anthony Sherwood).Arriving in the newspaper press room at the courthouse, Christy greets newspaper reporters Morosini (Joe Silver), Obregon (Allan Royal), and Jessica (Monica Parker). Ike Roscoe's attorney, Pamela Farbrother (Fiona Reed), arrives at the news office and tells the reporters that Ike did not receive a fair trial, but they ignore her. Pamela leaves crying, and Siegenthaler telephones Christy to inform her that Blaine is stuck in an elevator. Christy rushes to the building and learns that Sully told Siegenthaler to get Blaine onto the elevator. To distract Blaine into releasing the emergency stop, Christy kisses him.Returning to SNN, Christy, Siegenthaler, and her crew run into the newsroom with Ike's interview, but Abigail the security guard stops Blaine, and thoroughly searches him. After giving Sully a heated argument about his scheming to keep her in town, Christy goes on-air to introduce her exclusive interview with Ike Roscoe. After the interview, the Governor is inundated with calls from citizens asking him to pardon Ike Roscoe, and decides to issue a pardon during the 11:00 news. One of the Governor's aids, Crannock (Grant Cowan), sneaks away and telephones Ridnitz about the pardon. Determined to see Ike executed to improve his political image to the public, Ridnitz orders Warden Terwilliger to move up the execution to 10:00 pm, under the pretense of ongoing riots and bomb threats. Ridnitz further decides to invite the media to televise the execution live.At SNN, Sully turns on the television to see if other stations are reporting Christy's interview. However, the first story reported is on the record amount of ""no-shows"" for flights to New York. Sully receives a call from Ridnitz's associates, informing him that Ike Roscoe will be electrocuted earlier than scheduled, and his execution open to reporters. Blaine arrives, reminding Christy of their train. Christy says goodbye, and leaves with Blaine.At the prison, reporters crowd the execution chamber. Before Ike Roscoe is escorted to the chamber, his lawyer, Pamela Farbrother, arrives and kisses him. Afterward, the guards guide her away. As Ike is blindfolded and strapped into the chair, Ridnitz and Warden Terwilliger stand by to press the buttons that will send the electrical currents. However, when the buttons are pressed, the power goes out due to a power surge resulting from all the TV cameras being plugged into the chamber's one outlet. After flicking their pocket lighters on, everyone discovers that Ike has escaped.Meanwhile, Christy sees Ike as Blaine's limousine passes the jailhouse. She gets out and tells Blaine she will meet him at the station. When she catches up to Ike, Christy tells him to go to the second floor courthouse press room. Christy telephones Sully from the press room and tells him she found Ike. After she hangs up, Ike hides inside the press room photo copier as other reporters arrive. When Obregon goes to use the copier, he hears the machine groan. Christy offers to fix it, and unhooks Ike's shirtsleeve caught inside the machine. Just then, Ridnitz arrives with armed police, and announces that Ike was seen on the third floor.After the others disperse in search of Ike, Christy lets him out of the copier. Pamela arrives and hugs Ike, but pushes him back into the copier as reporters return. Obregon attempts to fix the copier himself. To distract him, Pamela jumps out a room's window to the courthouse lobby. Just then, Sully arrives with Siegenthaler and Christy's camera crew. As Christy gestures to the copier, Sully orders SNN reporter Karen Ludlow to interview Pamela about her jump. After the reporters run downstairs again, Ike gets out of the copier and records an interview with Christy about his escape. Afterward, Ike hides in the copier once again when the reporters return. To get the copier out of the courthouse, Sully offers to buy the copier, and Obregon agrees at first. Blaine arrives and Christy convinces him to wait five minutes. Having second thoughts, Obregon asks for the copier back. Instead, Sully offers him a job at SNN in exchange for the copier. After Sully and Christy leave for the elevator, reporters Zaks, Tillinger, and Carvalho conclude that Ike is hiding inside of the copier. The elevator arrives with Ridnitz and police. Sully and Christy stand in front of the machine, but officers pull them aside and shoot. Ridnitz opens the copier, and finds it empty. Ordering police to continue their search, Ridnitz asks Sully and Christy where Ike is. Warden Terwilliger arrives and announces that the Governor has just pardoned Ike Roscoe. Unseen by Ridnitz, Christy turns on a news camera, and tricks Ridnitz into confessing that he wanted Ike executed in order to win the election. Just then, the Governor arrives and reiterates that he has pardoned Ike Roscoe. Christy assists Ike as he climbs down from roof of the elevator car, then informs the Governor that she has Ridnitz's confession on bribery, attempted murder, and other charges on tape. Sully hands the tape over to Siegenthaler and tells him to run the story.Sully and Christy return the newsroom, and Blaine tells Christy that her true loves are the news and Sully. After Blaine leaves, Sully tells Christy they are going to Hawaii for their second honeymoon. Later in the final scene, as they lie on a beach enjoying their trip, a volcano erupts.

Clean and Sober,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094884/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A hustling drug addict checks himself into rehabilitation to escape trouble with the law and realizes that it's exactly what he needs. Michael Keaton plays Daryl Poynter, a hot shot real estate agent who just happens to have a cocaine and drinking problem. One morning, he wakes up to find a dead woman in his bed (someone he had been partying with the night before) from a cocaine overdose. He also just happens to receive a phone call from his employers telling him a huge sum of money is missing from one of his accounts. Panicking, Daryl decides to check into a drug rehab to hide from the law, where he meets tough cookie Morgan Freeman. A recovering addict himself, he now works as a drug counselor, and knows all the tricks Daryl tries to pull. Soon Daryl discovers he just might be in the right place, after all.—Humberto Amador In Philadelphia, brash commercial real estate agent Daryl Poynter, a cocaine addict and alcoholic (although he doesn't believe he has a problem in either of those two aspects), checks himself into a drug rehab center solely to go into hiding from the possible criminal and legal alternatives, most specifically that he has embezzled $92,000 to play the stock market in turn to pay off drug debts, his stocks which have instead lost money, and who was a one-nighter, Karen Peluso, ended up having a heart attack in his bed the result of a drug overdose, the police and her loved ones who may not care that she was the one who supplied the cocaine that night in laying blame. He expects to do the minimum required to stay in the facility as he carries on with what he considers the important aspects of his life, especially with regard to the the escrow account from which he stole the money, his stocks, and Karen's health status, all the while trying to get drugs from his regular suppliers. What he doesn't expect is the tough love of the facility's counselor Craig, who has almost zero tolerance on contravention of any of the facility's and his own policies, and making a true connection to some of his fellow patients, most specifically Charlie Standers. Charlie, a steel mill worker, has her own problems beyond her drug addiction, namely being in an abusive ten year relationship with Lenny, a relationship from which she seems unable to break free. With the help of who ends up being his sponsor Richard Dirks, Daryl may get to a point of truly dealing with his life in an up front manner as opposed to the lying and scheming and schmoozing that has been his modus operandi.—Huggo When moderately successful Daryl (Micheal Keaton) wakes from a cocaine/drinking evening to find last night's date a little too passed out, he bundles her up and dumps her at a hospital and drives away. Then we find that he also has bad financial troubles. One wretching scene when he calls his parents very late at night asking for his inheritence now when it will do him some good is very well done. He needs to return stolen money at work before they find out what he's done, plus he needs more cocaine. When he finds the young lady he dumped at the hospital died he commences to find a way to avoid going to jail.He decides to check himself into a chemical dependency program, that way maybe the police won't find him, and if his employers do find him they'll realize he has found the error of his ways and is trying to rectify himself. Though once in rehab he runs head long into Craig (Morgan Freeman) who knows Daryl better than he knows himself. Craig is not at all sympathetic to anything Daryl is feeling or fearing. He knows because he's been there, but Daryl still tries to defy rules that just don't apply to him, he's different, not like those other junkies. He is made to comply or get out, which would mean to jail from both his employer and the death of the girl.Once finally in and part of, Daryl begins to see his part in much of the troubles in his life. He also notices fellow inmate Charlie (Kathy Baker) which is a distraction he does not need right now. Fixating on her gives him a pal to do all this work that needs to be done with, except, Charlie is married.Again I say, the writer has either been there or has really, really watched ""there,"" because the behaviors are true. The lying, the promises, the rationalization, and the pain that takes place in these situations. As usual, it won't get the praise it deserves because for many it hits too close to home. They'll watch it happen to stars in the tabloids but it's happening in our own neighborhoods and schools. Open your eyes people!"

Without a Clue,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096454/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A drunken Sherlock Holmes is really just a cover for the real detective, Dr. Watson. This is a Sherlock Holmes story with a difference. Here, Dr. Watson is the ace detective and has been using an actor to play the part Holmes. Holmes is a drunken actor and gets on Watson's nerves. When Watson tries to go it alone, he doesn't have much success, so he is forced to let Holmes take all the credit once more.—Rob Hartill A farcical take on the Sherlock Holmes stories, which proposes that the world's greatest detective is merely the fictional creation of Dr. Watson (Kingsley), the real crime-solving genius. However, the doctor has a problem, in that he needs someone to appear as Holmes, and the best he can turn up is drunken stage actor Reginald Kincaid (Caine). To cap it all, the ill-matched pair find themselves the victims of the villainous Moriarty. Sherlock Holmes is as dashing as ever, but with a little secret: Dr. Watson is the brains behing the operation. Watson scripts all of Holmes' solutions, having discovered that while people would believe in Holmes, no one was ready to accept, Dr. Watson, Crime Doctor. When Reginald Kincaid, the actor he has hired to play Holmes becomes insufferable, Watson fires him and tries to go out on his own, but finds that he has done all too good a job building Holmes up in the public's mind.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Sherlock Holmes is real, except he's a fake.It's a world where the London public reads the mysteries of the greatest living detective, as chronicled by his friend Dr. Watson, in the Strand Magazine. The story begins as one such adventure ends, with the famous pair catching some criminals in the act. The familiar Inspector Lestrade arrives with enough manpower to make the arrests. Holmes dramatically declares the case closed.Once everyone's gone, Watson loudly calls Holmes an idiot.On the carriage ride back to Baker Street, Holmes meekly asks what mistakes he's made, but is more concerned with impressing reporters that await them at the entry stairs. After going indoors, an argument ensues with Missus Hudson taking Watson's side. It is clear that Watson is smarter than the average doctor whereas the well-known genius of Sherlock Holmes is just a facade known only to the three of them. Watson and Hudson have had enough.Watson visits the offices of the Strand Magazine and confesses the backstory. He solved the Study in Scarlet (Holmes' famous first case) by himself. But the timing coincided with his medical license renewal, and he didn't want the stuff-shirt review board distracted by his moonlighting as a mystery solver.So he claimed to have met a detective who'd done the job. Gossip spread and many wanted a face to go with the made-up name. Watson therefore sought a stage actor, not realizing he'd have to hire him full-time.Enter Reginald Kincaid, a great one for maintaining a character, but secretly a bungling alcoholic.At cost of exposing his own great lie, Watson has now chosen to fire his fake Holmes, but perilous circumstances may make their parting fatal. Watson finds it harder than expected to escape Sherlock's shadow, and Reginald is stuck trying to solve his hardest case yet with no real head for detection.Meanwhile, Professor Moriarty has stolen printing plates to mint his own money, and may already know the sad secret of Sherlock Holmes."

The Blob,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094761/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A deadly entity from space crash-lands near a small town and begins consuming everyone in its path. Panic ensues as shady government scientists try to contain the horrific creature. Meg Penny is a cheerleader out on her first date with one of the football players, Paul Taylor. It doesn't go very well. Before they get where they're going, an old vagrant runs out in front of Paul's car, screaming in terror. The old man is closely followed by Brian Flagg, the local teen rebel, complete with long hair, black leather jacket, motorcycle and tough-guy attitude. Paul blames Brian for chasing the old man, but after the threesome takes him to the doctor's office, it becomes clear the vagrant had more to worry about than some young tough. He was screaming because of the acid-like substance on his hand - a substance that spreads over his body and eventually consumes him. Soon, the growing red blob, which sprouts tentacles to attack its victims, becomes a menace to the small town of Arbeville, Colorado. The military soon arrives in Hazmat suits, led by the wide-eyed Dr. Christopher Meddows. They're from the government, they say, and they want to help; but Brian's distrust for authority figures proves justified when he learns of their true motives.—J. Spurlin A remake of the 1958 Steve McQueen film of the same name which follows a jelly-like, amoebic organism that crashes down to Earth from a meteorite n dissolves anything in its path, thereby growing in size. Military fellas step in to contain the situation but one rebellious kid knows the secret and will not give in to the commands of the authorities.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com A meteorite crashes near the town of Arborville, California. An elderly transient (Billy Beck) discovers, within the sphere, a jelly-like substance (the Blob) that attaches itself to his hand. Three high school students, Brian (Kevin Dillon), the rebellious biker whose next false step will take him to major jail, as this day is precisely his 18th birthday, Meg (Shawnee Smith) the pretty high school girl, and Paul (Donovan Leitch) the successful football player, encounter the man and take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient's body melting (or dissolving or being digested) from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg arrives to see Paul being dissolved by the growing Blob and while trying to free him his arm is torn from his body, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious and the Blob oozes out of the hospital and oozes into a nearby manhole into a sewer.After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police who refuses to believe the teens that something is going on, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when the diner's handyman is grabbed and pulled head first through the sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer where it retreats because it cannot tolerate extreme cold. After eating the diner's owner and the town's sheriff, the Blob reenters the sewers.Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs (Paul McCrane) is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca), who orders the town quarantined. Brian escapes a military van and collects his motorbike.Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother Kevin (Michael Kenworthy) is missing. Meg learns he and his friend Eddie (Douglas Emerson) have sneaked into the local theater to see a slasher film thanks to Eddie's usher brother Anthony (Jamison Newlander). The Blob infiltrates the theater and attacks the staff and then the audience... growing with each person it absorbs and digests. Meg just manages to rescue Eddie and Kevin.Meanwhile, Brian eavesdrops on Meddows speaking to his assistant Jennings (Robert Axelrod) and learns that the Blob is a biological warfare experiment created during the Cold War. Anthony then reports that he witnessed The Blob chasing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie into the sewers. Brian overhears Meadows decide to trap The Blob in the sewers, and that he is willing to let Meg, Kevin, and Eddie die to do so. Brian is discovered listening in and evades military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers.In the sewers, Meg, Eddie, and Kevin flee from the Blob. Kevin escapes to the surface by scaling a pipe and squeezing through a grate while Eddie is devoured. Meg is saved by Brian, who confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. After failing to convince everyone Brian is contaminated and must die, Meddows attempts to shoot Brian, but is killed by the Blob as it drags him into the sewer with one of its tentacles. The Blob then bursts from the sewers in a massive and sicking glob of reddish-like jello proceeds to feast upon the population, proving impervious to the military's attempts to stop it (getting shot multiple times while in the sewer and blown up, which only angered it). In the ensuing panic, the town's Reverend Meeker (Del Close) proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, when a failed flamethrower attack on the Blob sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher, and in the process blasts the Blob with it. The monster backs off, and she realizes that it cannot stand cold.The surviving humans retreat to the town hall and hold the Blob at bay with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, but it is a losing battle, as a result with the Blob engulfing half of the building and devouring Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a snow maker truck that has canisters of liquid nitrogen attached. Just as the Blob is about to devour Meg and her family, Brian drives to town hall and shoots snow at the creature, which is angered and knocks the truck over. As the Blob surges toward Brian, Meg lures it away from him towards the canisters which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. She tries to get clear, but snags her foot between two pieces of metal, leaving her dangling upside down. Brian regains consciousness and runs over to free her. The Blob is about to overrun them when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob with liquid nitrogen. The creature is flash-frozen, shattering into a mass of crystallized pieces. Moss Woodley (Beau Billingslea) has its remains hauled away to the town ice house.In the final scene, there is a tent-meeting church service in a field, where Meeker, disfigured by his burn injuries, is now crazed, preaching a doomsday sermon sounding like the Blob's attack. Afterwards, when an old woman asks him when the time of reckoning will come, he replies ""Soon... Madame... soon. The Lord will give me a sign"", and holds up a glass jar containing a fragment of the Blob that he took from the ice house... which is slowly moving."
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096764/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An account of Baron Munchausen's supposed travels and fantastical experiences across late 18th-century Europe with his band of misfits. The fantastic tale of an 18th-century aristocrat, his talented henchmen, and a little girl in their efforts to save a town from defeat by the Turks. Being swallowed by a giant sea-monster, journeying to the moon, dancing with Venus, and escaping from the Grim Reaper are only some of the improbable adventures.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In the late 18th century, a European town is under siege of the Turkish army. Meanwhile, the theater company owned by Henry Saltis entertains the dwellers with the production of ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"". Out of the blue, an old man interrupts the presentation claiming that he is Hieronymus Karl Frederick Baron von Munchausen and the tells that he is the one to be blamed by the Turkish attack. The Baron Munchausen tells how he had won a bet against the Sultan with the abilities of his servants Berthold, Adolphus, Albrecht, and Gustavus, and earned his treasure. Further, he offers to help the locals against the Turks and builds a balloon to seek out his missing servants. During his journey, he finds a girl named Sally hidden in the balloon and they travel to the moon, where they meet Roger, the deranged King of the Moon with a detachable head, and his wife, Ariadne, the Queen of the Moon.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Bent on saving a besieged European city from the clutches of a Turkish Sultan and his soldiers, Baron von Munchausen, the incredible aristocrat of fabrication, embarks on an enchanting odyssey to the four corners of the world--and beyond. Accompanied by young stowaway Sally Salt, the dauntless Baron sets off on a dangerous mission to assemble his old team of remarkable gentlemen, only to face regal Selenites; lovelorn deities; the immaculate personification of beauty; and gigantic, deep-sea leviathans. Now the fate of the war-ravaged town rests in the hands of a handful of defenders; however, a persistent, and above all, eternal dark adversary threatens to thwart the Baron's altruistic plans. Can the extraordinary Baron von Munchausen carry out his impossible task?—Nick Riganas During the late 18th century, when Austria is at war with the Turks, an Austrian town is besieged and in the town a local theatrical producer is presenting the story of Baron Munchausen. One night a man appears, claiming to be the actual Baron Munchausen.—grantss The film begins in an unnamed and war-torn European city in the late 18th century (dubbed ""The Age of Reason"" in an opening caption), where, amidst explosions and gunfire from a large Turkish army outside the city gates, a fanciful touring stage production of Baron Münchhausen's life and adventures is taking place. Backstage, city official ""The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson"" (Jonathan Pryce) reinforces the city's commitment to reason (here meaning uniformity and unexceptionality) by ordering the execution of a soldier who had just accomplished a near-superhuman feat of bravery (Sting in a cameo), claiming that his bravery is demoralizing to other soldiers. Not far into the play, an elderly man claiming to be the real Baron interrupts the show, protesting its many inaccuracies. Over the complaints of the audience, the theater company and Jackson, the ""real"" Baron gains the house's attention and narrates through flashback an account of one of his adventures, of a life-or-death wager with the Grand Turk, where the younger Baron's life is saved only by his amazing luck plus the assistance of his remarkable associates: Berthold (Eric Idle), the world's fastest runner; Adolphus (Charles McKeown), a rifleman with superhuman eyesight; Gustavus (Jack Purvis), who possesses extraordinary hearing, and sufficient lung power to knock down an army by exhaling; and Albrecht (Winston Dennis), a fantastically strong man.When gunfire disrupts the elderly Baron's story, the importance of saving the city eclipses the show. The Baron wanders backstage intending to die, until the exuberantly enthusiastic questioning of Sally Salt (Sarah Polley), the young daughter of the theater company's leader, persuades him to remain living.Insisting that he alone can save the city, the Baron escapes the city's walls in a hot air balloon constructed of women's underwear, accompanied by Sally as a stowaway. The balloon expedition proceeds to the Moon, where the Baron, rejuvenated by the escape, finds his old associate Berthold, but angers the King of the Moon (Robin Williams), who resents the Baron for his romantic past with the Queen of the Moon (Valentina Cortese). A bungled escape from the Moon brings the trio back to (and beneath) the Earth, where the Roman God Vulcan (Oliver Reed) hosts his guests with courtesy and Albrecht is found. The Baron and Vulcan's wife, the Goddess Venus (Uma Thurman), attempt a romantic interlude by waltzing in air, but this cuts short the hospitality and Vulcan expels the now-foursome from his kingdom into the South Seas.Swallowed by an enormous sea creature, the travelers locate Gustavus, Adolphus, and the Baron's trusty horse Bucephalus. The Baron (who again appears elderly after being ""expelled from a state of bliss"", in his words) struggles with the conflicting goals of heroism and a peaceful death, before deciding to escape by blowing ""a modicum of snuff"" out into the sea creature's cavernous interior, which causes the sea creature to ""sneeze"" the heroes out through its whale-like blowhole.Back ashore, the Turkish army is located but the Baron's associates are now too elderly and tired to fight the Turk as in the old days. The Baron lectures them firmly but to no avail, and he storms off intending to surrender to the Turk and to Jackson; his cohorts rally to save both the Baron and the city.During the city's celebratory parade, the Baron is shot dead by Jackson. An emotional public funeral takes place, but the denouement reveals that this is merely the final scene of yet another story the Baron is telling to the same theater-goers who were attending the theater in the beginning of the film. The Baron calls the foregoing ""only one of the many occasions on which I met my death"" and closes his tale by saying ""everyone who had a talent for it lived happily ever after.""An ambiguous finale reveals that the city has indeed been saved, even though the events of the battle apparently occurred in a story rather than the film's reality. The Baron rides off on Bucephalus. As the Baron and Bucephalus are bathed in the light of the sun parting through the clouds, they apparently disappear, and the credits roll over a triumphant blast of music."

The Last Temptation of Christ,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095497/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life ofJesus Christ, his journey through life as he faces the struggles all humans do, and his final temptation on the cross. The carpenter, Jesus of Nazareth, tormented by the temptations of demons, the guilt of making crosses for the Romans, pity for men and the world, and the constant call of God, sets out to find what God wills for Him. But as His mission nears fulfillment, He must face the greatest temptation; the normal life of a good man. Based, not on the Gospels, but on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same name.—Nick Lopez <ntlopez@fas.harvard.edu> Jesus, a carpenter in Nazareth, Judea,during the Roman occupation, has been hearing voices and having premonitions that tell him that God has a special plan for him, in atonement for sins. He assumes it is his own sins and is confused about what to do, although he has a firm will to follow any commands from God. Because he senses that he himself will be crucified some day, he constructs crosses for Roman use in executing criminals and rebels, an act of traitorous collaboration in the eyes of others in his town, including Mary Magdalene, who spits on him. Judas, a zealot rebel, appreciates Jesus' devotion to God and attempts to recruit him to the zealot cause, but Jesus refuses.Jesus feels guilty about his inability to correspond to the adult love of his childhood friend, Mary Magdalene, who in her dejection has become a prostitute. He asks Mary to forgive him. Mary asks Jesus to stay with her, which Jesus is tempted to do, but he rejects the temptation and heads for a monastic community. At that community, he experiences his own unusual powers as two deadly cobras obey his command, and he learns that the community leader who welcomed him the night before was already dead. One of the monks in the community convinces Jesus that the fact that God communicates with him is extraordinary.Judas is sent with orders to kill Jesus for being a collaborator. Judas senses Jesus is specially favored by God, and asks Jesus to lead the rebellion against the Romans. Jesus tries to tell Judas that his message is love, that love of one's fellow humans is the key to God's will. Judas promises to join Jesus in his ministry, but with the threat that he will kill him if he strays from his ministry. Thus influenced by Judas, Jesus agrees to abandon his will to that of God, become a teacher, and let God speak through him.As he walks to begin his new life, Jesus comes across an angry mob which is dragging Mary Magdalene to be stoned for her prostitution and working for Romans on the sabbath. Jesus interrupts the stoning, challenging the crowd to admit they have all sinned, asking whoever has not sinned to take a bigger stone from his hand. Half the crowd sneaks away, the other half stays to hear what he has to say. He opens his mouth and begins his teaching in parables, awkwardly at first, but growing in confidence and preaching with the phrases recorded as the Sermon on the Mount.Jesus develops a following of disciples, but he is still uncertain of his role. He experiences his own unusual power as, while eating an apple, he throws out the apple seeds, and one of them becomes a full grown tree with fruit. Judas convinces him to travel to see John the Baptist, who has publicly claimed that he is preparing the way for the Messiah, telling him that John surely will know what Jesus' mission really is. The nearly fanatical John baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing views. John believes that Jews must first gain freedom from the Romans before the kingdom of God is declared, while Jesus believes that love is more important.John tells him that God speaks most clearly in the desert, so Jesus then goes into the desert to see if God's will may be clearly revealed to him. Choosing a spot in the desert, Jesus draws a circle on the ground and vows he will not leave the circle until God has made his will known. While in the circle, Satan appears to him, first as a snake, then as a lion, finally as a pillar of fire, to tempt him. Jesus resists these temptations. An apple tree bearing luscious fruit appears to him, but he conquers his hunger and instead of eating he chops down the tree. At this point he realizes that the message from God is that he is strong enough to rebuff Satan. He walks out of the desert. He comes across the home of Martha and Mary, who take him in and help him recover from his long fast. He rejoins his disciples after his recovery. In front of them he takes out his heart in his hand to prove his authority and tells them to follow him. He performs many signs and wonders and each increases his confidence that he is in fact God's son and the Messiah. He turns water into wine, he restores the vision of a blind man, heals cripples so they walk, he raises Lazarus from the dead, and casts out many demons. His ministry finds rejection and enmity in many quarters. In his own town of Nazareth none come to join him, and Saul, a Roman agent, eventually murders the resurrected Lazarus to destroy the greatest evidence of his divine power.Eventually Jesus and his followers enter Jerusalem, where he is received with joy by many. Jesus goes to the temple, where he is enraged by the money changers and throws them out. The angry Jesus even leads his followers to try to take the temple by force, but as he reaches the steps he begins bleeding from his hands. He stops, realizes he is doing the will of men and not of God, and that he must die in order to bring salvation to all, Jews and all others. He asks Judas, his strongest apostle and the one who best understands him, to betray him to the Romans, a task Judas does not want to do. Nevertheless, Jesus insists that this is the only way and Judas acquiesces, weeping.Jesus joins his disciples, Martha, Mary, Mary Magdalene and his mother for the Passover seder, where he breaks bread telling them all to eat of it, for it is his body, and to drink from his wine cup, for it is his blood, commanding them to do this again to remember him.. After the meal, while in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas leads the Roman soldiers to Jesus and identifies him. Peter cuts off the ear of Malchus and Jesus performs the miracle of reattaching it. Pontius Pilate tells Jesus that he must be put to death because he represents a threat against the status quo, the Roman Empire. Jesus is flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head. He is led to Golgotha, where he is crucified.From the cross Jesus sees a young girl who tells him she is his guardian angel who has been sent to rescue him. She tells him that it is not necessary for him to die on the cross, because God loves him, is pleased with him, and wants his happiness. She brings him down from the cross and leads him away.She takes him to be with Mary Magdalene, who cleans his wounds, and the couple make love. The couple has a child and lives a tranquil life in a forest cabin. Mary dies during a pregnancy, and the sobbing Jesus is told by the angel that there is only one woman, all women are ""Mary"", and takes him to be comforted by Martha and Mary, the sisters of Lazarus. He has a family with them and lives a peaceful life as a carpenter. Some years later he encounters the apostle Paul describing his own conversion and preaching about the Messiah. Jesus tries to tell Paul that he is the man that Paul has been preaching about but Paul rejects him, saying that he needs the Jesus who died and resurrected to bring salvation to all.In old life and near death, Jesus' former disciples visit him. Judas arrives last, tells Jesus he has been a traitor. The angel who stopped his crucifixion is recognized as Satan in disguise, who tempted him into a life of comfort as an ordinary man. Jesus realizes that he should have died to bring salvation to all. Although aged and weak, Jesus crawls back to the edge of a burning Jerusalem at the time of the Jewish Rebellion, he reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his mission, crying out ""Let me be Your Son!"".We see Jesus back on the cross. The whole episode with the fake angel must have been a dreamy hallucination. He smiles in recognition of his destiny and cries out ""It is accomplished! It is accomplished!"", as he dies. A blinding white light envelops everything."

After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house.

Over the next several months, Mike and Reggie travel the country roads, encountering abandoned towns and pillaged graveyards, as well as a few traps and apparitions the Tall Man has left. One of them is an apparition of a fully nude deceased young woman. The clues lead them to Perigord, Oregon.Meanwhile, Liz's grandfather has died and she accompanies her grandmother to the funeral with her sister Jeri, who leaves prematurely and mysteriously vanishes. While searching for her, Liz explores the mortuary and discovers an exhumed coffin, but before she can open it, the Tall Man surprises her and she runs away. The presiding priest Father Meyers (Kenneth Tigar) maddened with fear and alcohol withdrawal, desecrates the grandfather's body with a knife in a desperate attempt to thwart the mysterious occurrences he has witnessed.That evening, during a bout of drinking, the reanimated grandfather surprises him at his door and then spirits into the grandmother's bed before absconding with her. In the morning, Liz finds the empty bed and a funeral pin; the Tall Man psychically tells her to return at night if she wants to rescue her grandmother.Prior to their arrival in Perigord, Mike awakens to find that Reggie has picked up a hitchhiker named Alchemy (Samantha Phillips) who eerily resembles the nude apparition.

In lieu of a handle, there is a large round ""keyhole"" in the wall and Mike realizes that they must capture a sphere in order to access the room. They then split up to find Liz.Reggie searches the basement where he is attacked by a Graver, then four Lurkers. Mike saves Liz from a flying silver sphere but they are both attacked by the other mortician, who is defeated when the silver sphere pins his hand to a door and he cuts off the hand with an axe in an attempt to escape another sphere. A laser-armed flying golden sphere pursues Mike and Liz but instead kills the second mortician as he tries to catch them.Reuniting with Reggie, the three pry the mortician's severed hand off the door and carry the embedded silver sphere to the embalming room, where they insert it into the ""keyhole"" and open the metal door to the white room containing the portal. Reggie ignites the flamethrower to burn the building down, but the Tall Man surprises them, knocking Reggie down, throwing Mike into the portal, and carrying Liz to the embalming table. Reggie helps Mike climb back out, while the Tall Man prepares to embalm Liz alive with a giant probe; Mike pulls the silver sphere from the keyhole and attacks the Tall Man with it unsuccessfully. Liz gets free and stabs the Tall Man with the probe, and Reggie quickly activates the embalming machine, pumping the acid-contaminated fluid into him, causing him to melt. Reggie sets fire to the room and hallways and the trio are greeted at the back entrance by Alchemy, who has procured an abandoned hearse.They ride off with Mike and Liz in the rear compartment and Reggie and Alchemy in the driver's cabin. Reggie thanks Alchemy for coming back for them and tries to flirt with her until she gently plucks a section of hair and flesh from her head, revealing that she is not human. As Reggie screams, the hearse swerves wildly and Mike and Liz try to get out; the hearse stops and a bloody and battered Reggie hits the window before falling to the ground. As the hearse begins to drive away, Mike and Liz tell each other ""this is just a dream"" but the slot to the driver's cabin opens, revealing the Tall Man who tells them ""No, it's not!""Hands break the rear window and pull Mike and Liz through it... mirroring the ending of the first film."

Carson, who is engaged to her high school beau, Harley Ralston (Tyrone Power Jr.), panics when she hears, while in the car, the girls are taking her to Myrtle Beach instead of Fort Sumter, where they all told their parents they were going. Although Carson claims she is not allowed to go to Myrtle Beach, her friends are set on showing her a good time before her wedding.At Myrtle Beach, they see a banner for the Sun Fun Festival that weekend, and an advertisement for a ""shag"" dance contest at The Pavilion. This piques the interest of Pudge, who loves to dance the shag. Arriving at the beach house owned by Luanne's father, Senator Clatterbuck (Donald Craig), she gives everyone strict rules not to sit on the furniture, use the telephone, or open her father's liquor cabinet.That evening, Carson bursts into tears, worried that the girls will forget her when they go to college and questioning her decision to marry Harley. The girls assure Carson she will be okay and take her dancing at The Pavilion. There, Buzz Ravenal (Robert Rusler) and Chip Guillyard (Scott Coffey), two local boys who taunted the girls in traffic earlier, sit down with Carson and Pudge. Carson tells Buzz she is engaged, but he persuades her to dance with him anyway.

Melaina emerges from a bathroom stall and vows to beat Suette.Meanwhile, Chip tries to make conversation with Pudge, asking if she knows any elephant jokes. She prickles, assuming he is making fun of her weight. Chip assures her he doesn't think she has a weight problem. Buzz asks Carson to go ""parking"" with him, but she refuses. However, he lures her to a boardwalk amusement park with Pudge and Chip. Melaina leaves The Pavilion with Big Bob, and Luanne is outraged that all her friends have abandoned her and worse still, tries to escape from a crazy guy who wants to dance with her.At a secluded parking spot, Big Bob tries to have sex with Melaina, who is still a virgin. She fights him off and receives unexpected help when Suette and Nadine appear, pulling her out of the car. After reprimanding Big Bob, the girls spray Melaina with shaving cream, cover her in feathers, force alcohol down her throat, and leave her lying on the ground. A little later, Luanne drives by in search of Melaina and rescues her after finding her laying on the ground, very inebriated and singing Bible songs. She takes Melaina back to the house to bathe and clean her up. Melaina tells Luanne about what the two young women did to her and vows to get back at them by entering and winning the Miss Sun Queen beauty pageant.Meanwhile, Pudge, Chip, Carson and Buzz go to a drive-in restaurant. Pudge gives Chip dance lessons, while Buzz offends Carson by calling her uptight and conventional. She argues that she doesn't believe in ""free love"" like Buzz, but cannot resist him when he kisses her. Later that night, Carson calls Harley and informs her fiancé she is in Myrtle Beach, not Fort Sumter. Harley encourages her to come home, but Carson insists on staying.In the morning, Chip and Buzz arrive at the beach house. Pudge is confronted by Chip while still in her nightgown and hair rollers, but she is pleased he has come by to see her and she begins their dance lessons. At the same time, Buzz wakes Carson up by dangling a fly fishing lure in her face and asks her to go fishing with him. Once she tells him nothing will ever happen between them, he agrees and says they should just be friends.Meanwhile, Luanne finds Melaina practicing a dance routine in her bikini while waving a Confederate battle flag to the tune of 'Dixie'. She forbids her friend from degrading herself at the Miss Sun Queen Pageant, demanding that she wear a ladylike one-piece bathing suit and perform a dramatic monologue from 'Gone with the Wind', instead. Melaina does not believe the understated approach will help her win. She reminds Luanne that she has no plans for college and needs to make something of herself, but Luanne stands her ground.Pudge and Chip go to the beach, and Chip embarrasses Pudge by reading a questionnaire about sexual experience. Pudge says she is inexperienced because boys do not see her ""that way,"" and Chip reveals he is also a virgin. On a dock, Carson tells Buzz that her fiancée, Harley, plans to work for his father's tobacco company. Unimpressed, Buzz, who will be attending Yale University in the fall, says he plans to travel to Italy.Popular singer Jimmy Valentine (Jeff Yagher) arrives as the celebrity guest judge at the Miss Sun Queen Pageant. Clad in Luanne's one-piece bathing suit, Melaina watches in agony as Suette performs a provocative dance to the strains of ""Dixie,"" clad in a Confederate flag bikini. Harley shows up in search of Carson, and Luanne distracts him as Carson and Buzz flee. Melaina's dramatic monologue draws some snickers from Jimmy Valentine, and Suette is crowned Miss Sun Queen.Backstage, Melaina blames Luanne for her loss, and orders Luanne to invite Valentine back to the beach house for a party. Luanne uses her father's name to convince Valentine to come to the house. Wearing Luanne's mother's clothes, Melaina holds Jimmy Valentine's attention for a while, but he becomes bored and threatens to leave. Chip asks Pudge to dance with him in the shag contest the next day, and she excitedly agrees. Melaina begs Chip to invite more friends over to keep Valentine's interest. Carson and Buzz sneak out of the house to avoid Harley, who bonds with Luanne as droves of locals show up at the house. Luanne tries to control the chaos as the party rages out of control but finally gives up and gets drunk with the other party goers. Meanwhile, Buzz takes Carson to a yacht owned by Luanne's father and convinces her to sleep with him. At the party, Chip drunkenly offends Pudge by saying he considers her a friend.The next morning, Elvira (Pearl Jones), the Clatterbucks' maid, arrives to find Luanne and Harley passed out on the front lawn and the whole inside of the house a mess. Elvira informs Luanne that her parents are set to arrive at noon. Luanne panics. Jimmy Valentine's manager shows up to retrieve his client, and tells Melaina he would never allow his client's career to be derailed by a low-class Southern girl.On the yacht, Buzz suggests Carson break up with Harley and attend college near Yale. Carson returns to the house and tells the other girls she lost her virginity. Luanne guesses Carson must love Buzz, but Carson says she hates him. She says that she is wild, and wonders if she should break off her engagement. Melaina fixes up her hair and steals one of Mrs. Clatterbuck's dresses with plans to dress up as a sophisticated starlet and impress Jimmy Valentine's manager. Pudge laments her unrequited love for Chip, and Melaina advises her to make herself look irresistible and act dismissive. Luanne gives Chip the task of picking up her parents at the airport and taking them directly to The Pavilion, where the Clatterbucks are set to judge the shag contest. Luanne then tasks everyone with cleaning up the mess in her parents house prior to their arrival. Luanne also tells Chip that Pudge must go back to Spartanburg with her and will therefore miss the contest.Driving the Clatterbucks into town in his car, Chip bemoans his missed opportunity with Pudge, and Senator Clatterbuck takes a liking to him when he realizes Chip is headed to his alma mater, the Naval Academy at Annapolis. Pudge gives Melaina a ride to The Pavilion in Luanne's car, and goes inside herself when she discovers that Melaina left her bag in the car. Pudge runs into Chip, and they enter the shag dance contest. Luanne and Harley, along with Buzz and Carson, then drive in Buzz' car (damaged and covered with shaving cream) to the Pavillion as well.After arriving at the Pavilion in search of the other girls, Luanne sees her parents as the judges in the shag contest as it gets underway with Nadine and her boyfriend, who happens to be Big Bob, also having entered and dancing their own dace. Luanne wants to concoct a story to tell her parents, but Carson urges her to tell them the truth about their weekend of forgoing Fort Sumter and Charleston for Myrtle Beach. Luanne says she'll tell her parents the truth if Carson tells Harley the truth. Carson tells Harley she can't marry him because she's in love with Buzz, and Luanne spills the beans about the two ""going all the way"" at her parents yacht. Harley attempts to hit Buzz, who ducks his blow and hits a mirror instead, and Luanne comforts him.Chip and Pudge dance the shag to the song ""Stagger Lee,"" and embrace when they win the contest, beating out Nadine and Big Bob. Jimmy Valentine's manager tells Melaina she has potential, and they discuss her future in Hollywood.Later, the Clatterbucks host a lawn party at the beach house. Harley and Luanne flirt (implying that they might hook up with each other). Nearby, Buzz and Carson are seen happy together after hooking up. Buzz tells Carson she should buy a winter coat so she can visit him at Yale. Melaina decides not to return home to her ""holly roller"" tyrant of a preacher father and travel right away to California to make it in the entertainment business. Chip tells Pudge that he will keep in touch with her after he leaves town and joins the US Naval Academy in Maryland. The film ends with the four girlfriends, Carson, Luanne, Melaina and Pudge, entertaining the party goers with a performance of their school song, ""Hail Spartanburg High."""
A Cry in the Dark,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094924/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mother whose child was killed in a dingo attack in the Australian Outback fights to prove her innocence when she is accused of murder. Based on the true story of Lindy Chamberlain. During a camping trip to Ayers Rock in outback Australia, she claimed that she witnessed a dingo stealing her baby daughter, Azaria, from the family tent. Azaria's body was never found. Police noted some apparent inconsistencies in her story, and she was charged with murder. The case attracted a lot of attention, turning an investigation into a media circus, with the public divided in their opinions.—Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> Based on the true story of Lindy Chamberlain who was convicted and then completely exonerated in the death of her infant daughter. While holidaying at Ayer's Rock with her husband Michael and their three children, Lindy said she saw a dingo enter their tent and carry away their weeks-old infant daughter, Azaria. The initial coroner's inquest supported her version of events but the police continued their investigation eventually leading her to be charged with murder and her husband with being an accessory after the fact. The case created a media frenzy in Australia and was the subject of much public debate.—garykmcd 1980. Of Mt Isa, QLD, Seventh Day Adventist Minister Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy Chamberlain, and their three children, the oldest six years old, are camping in a busy area next to Ayers Rock when one evening Lindy screams that a dingo is in their tent, the dingo running off, which only she witnesses, revealing that their youngest, ten-week old Azaria Chamberlain, is missing from her bassinet in the tent. Beyond the initial melee of trying to find Azaria with the help of all their fellow campers, Lindy and Michael, in their religious beliefs, outwardly come to a settled mindset that in not being able to find Azaria that the dingo has killed her, she in a better place with God in his plan for her. Over time as the story reaches national attention which is only fueled by Lindy and Michael talking to the media, evidence is discovered, which, in combination with things that are not discovered, such as Azaria's body, and the media stories, leads to Lindy being charged with Azaria's murder and Michael being charged with accessory to a murder after the fact, the crown charging that Lindy made up the story of the dingo to cover up her murdering Azaria. The purported dingo incident begins a close to decade long legal battle the two, but especially Lindy, have in trying to prove their innocence, the trial which cannot not be affected by the court of public opinion, especially as Lindy refuses to change her somewhat naturally cold demeanor solely to come across as a sympathetic character to the judgmental public.—Huggo Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain, his wife Lindy, their two sons, and their nine-week-old daughter Azaria are on a camping holiday in the Outback. With the baby sleeping in their tent, the family is enjoying a barbecue with their fellow campers when a cry is heard. Lindy returns to the tent to check on Azaria and is certain she sees a dingo with something in its mouth running off as she approaches. When she discovers the infant is missing, everyone joins forces to search for her, without success. It is assumed what Lindy saw was the animal carrying off the child, and a subsequent inquest rules her account of events is true.The tide of public opinion soon turns against the Chamberlains. For many, Lindy seems too stoic, too cold-hearted, and too accepting of the disaster that has befallen her. Gossip about her begins to swell and soon is accepted as statements of fact. The couple's beliefs are not widely practised in the country, and when the media reports a rumour that the name Azaria means ""sacrifice in the wilderness"" (when in fact it means ""blessed of God""), the public is quick to believe they decapitated their baby with a pair of scissors as part of a bizarre religious rite. Law-enforcement officials find new witnesses, forensics experts, and a lot of circumstantial evidenceincluding a small wooden coffin Michael uses as a receptacle for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettesand reopen the investigation, and eventually Lindy is charged with murder. Seven months pregnant, she ignores her attorneys' advice to play on the jury's sympathy and appears emotionless on the stand, convincing onlookers she is guilty of the crime of which she is accused. As the trial progresses, Michael's faith in his religion and his belief in his wife disintegrate, and he stumbles through his testimony, suggesting he is concealing the truth. In October 1982, Lindy is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour, while Michael is found guilty as an accessory and given an 18-month suspended sentence.More than three years later, while searching for the body of an English tourist who fell from Uluru, police discover a small item of clothing that is identified as the jacket Lindy had insisted Azaria was wearing over her jumpsuit, which had been recovered early in the investigation. She immediately is released from prison, the case is reopened, and all convictions against Lindy and Michael are overturned."

In New Orleans, a series of horrific murders of priests are occurring around the city's Catholic churches. The diocese calls in Father Michael (Cross) to fight the powerful demon, known as Daesidarius, or The Unholy. The Father's faith is tested almost to the breaking point as the demon - disguised as a stunningly beautiful lady - attempts to seduce Father Michael into breaking his vows. Father Michael soon learns how the Unholy works - by murdering the sinner in the act of sinning, then sending that person's soul to Hell. Will this one priest's inner strength be enough to stop this monster - or will he join the ranks of the other ill-fated priests?—medic249a2 While praying in St. Agnes church in New Orleans, Father Dennis is confronted by a demon taking the shape of a seductive woman. The woman tears his throat open, killing him. Several years later at a New Orleans hotel, Father Michael is called to talk to a man named Claude who is threatening to jump from the top floor of the building. When he offers Claude a cigarette, Michael is pulled out the window and falls to the ground. Inexplicably, he survives the fall without injury. After the incident, Michael is appointed to the St. Agnes parish by the Archbishop Mosely; the parish had been closed after Father Dennis's unsolved murder.Upon moving into the rectory, Michael is notified by Lieutenant Stern that another priest was murdered there before Father Dennis. Michael finds mention of Millie, a waitress at the Threshold, a local black magic performance art club, in Dennis's journal; Michael goes to visit her, but she is evasive. She later comes to the parish, claiming to Michael that she saw Father Dennis for confession before his death; during the confession, she admitted to giving her soul to Luke, the owner of the club, whom she claims is the Devil incarnate. Luke visits Michael shortly after, claiming that the Satanic shows put on at the club are only gimmicks, and that he does not actually believe in them; however, he says he's been recently experiencing supernatural phenomena and begs for Michael's help. Michael agrees to spend an evening in Luke's apartment, where he witnesses furious poltergeist activity.When Michael brings the information to Archbishop Mosely, he is informed that Father Dennis was approached by Millie and Luke in an identical manner before being murdered. Father Silva, an elderly blind demonologist, informs Michael he has been ""chosen"" to fight the devil, but Michael dismisses the notion. Millie is incarcerated in a psychiatric ward after attempting to kill Luke, and Michael goes to visit her. In a fit of madness, she claims Luke tried to rape her, and that Father Dennis has been talking to her. That night, Michael has a nightmare of the Demon, and receives a disturbing phone call from Father Dennis, who claims he is ""waiting for him in hell."" Millie arrives in the middle of the night begging for help, and Michael agrees to let her stay in the rectory.While cleaning the church with the housekeeper Teresa, Millie is fascinated by a statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which Teresa tells her was salvaged from a church in a foreign country that burned down. Lieutenant Stern warns Archbishop Mosely that Michael is in danger, suspecting Millie was responsible for the previous murders of the St. Agnes priests; Mosely assures him that Michael is safe. Meanwhile, Millie discovers a book in which she reads of a demon known as the Unholy, which seeks to corrupt and then take pure souls. To prevent herself from being a target, she propositions Michael to take her virginity, which he refuses. Convinced Luke planted the book, Michael confronts him, but Luke denies it.The next day, Michael finds Luke's eviscerated corpse hanging above the church altar in the pose of the Cross of Saint Peter. Seated in a pew is Claude, who begs Michael's forgiveness for pulling him out the window. Suddenly, Claude begins to bleed profusely from his eyes and mouth, and bursts into flames at the foot of the Immaculate Heart of Mary statue; Luke's corpse also ignites. Michael meets with the Archbishop and Father Silva, who warns him that the Unholy will manifest to Michael between Ash Wednesday and Easter, when it will try to tempt and then kill him. In the church, Michael is confronted by the Unhholy (taking form as the woman), and she attempts to seduce him, but he denies her.The Unholy reveals its true form-a monstrous creature-and two mutant creatures crucify Michael. Millie enters the church and is confronted by the creature, but before it can harm her, Michael calls upon God for strength, and damns the Unholy to hell. He collapses, and when he awakens, is blind.

U.S. embassy personnel and Vietnamese refugees board helicopters on the embassy's rooftop. U.S. Army Colonel James Braddock (Chuck Norris) enters the embassy looking for his Vietnamese wife, Lin Tan Cang Braddock (Miki Kim), an embassy translator. He learns that Lin returned home to get her travel papers.In her apartment, Lin packs for her departure with the help of a friend. While assisting Lin, the friend steals a white bracelet, a gift from Braddock. After Lin leaves the apartment, a missile is fired into the building, killing her friend. While Lin walks to the embassy, her purse and travel documents are stolen. Meanwhile, Braddock arrives at Lin's apartment and sees two medics carrying out a body with a white bracelet. Believing the body is Lin, Braddock returns to the embassy.Later, Lin reaches the embassy's gates, but is unable to enter without her documents. As she pleads with the gate captain, waves of Vietnamese citizens storm the embassy walls, forcing soldiers to lock the gates and close down the embassy. On the rooftop, Col. Braddock sees a man push a woman to steal her seat on a departing helicopter. Braddock throws the man aside, but he pulls a gun and shoots Braddock. Injured, Braddock is placed in the helicopter and departs from Saigon.Twelve years later in Washington, D.C., Reverend Polanski (Yehuda Efroni) of the Amerasian Children's Mission in Vietnam for orphaned children of American and Asian parentage, approaches Braddock in a bar. He informs Braddock that Lin is alive in Vietnam, and living with Braddock's 12-year-old Amerasian son, Van. Braddock tells him he saw Lin's body and he never had a child with her. Disappointed, Reverend Polanski leaves the bar to return to Vietnam. As Braddock readies to leave the bar as well, two Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents ask him to come with them. The agents bring Braddock to the office of Dan Littlejohn (Jack Rader). When Littlejohn asks if Reverend Polanski told him about his wife and son, Braddock concludes the story is true, otherwise the CIA would not have asked him about them. Braddock asks if the CIA will free his family, but Littlejohn says no.A few days later, Braddock flies to Bangkok, Thailand, and meets with Mik (Ron Barker), an expatriate pilot living in Thailand. Mik tells Braddock he has acquired a plane and supplies to allow Braddock to sneak into Vietnam. Before they leave, Littlejohn and CIA agents spot Mik and Braddock in a bar. As one agent leads Mik outside, Braddock fights Littlejohn and the others. Finding Mik in a car, they drive away, chased by Littlejohn's men and Thai law enforcement. After escaping, Braddock and Mik drive to the airfield. They fly toward the Vietnam coast.Braddock parachutes from the plane into the water below, with a jet-powered speedboat, and escapes capture by the Vietnamese military. Traveling along an inland waterway, Braddock hides his boat and looks for the Amerasian Children's Mission. Meanwhile, Reverend Polanski sits down for dinner with the orphans when he sees Braddock. He shows Braddock the hut where Lin and Van live. Upon entering, Lin hugs Braddock and introduces him to his son, Van. However, Van is distrustful of his father. The three leave, but Van lags behind and is stopped by two patrolmen. Braddock punches both men unconscious, and continues to direct Lin and Van to his boat.However, General Quoc (Aki Aleong) and his men surround the family. Quoc informs Braddock he has heard of his reputation during the Vietnam War of being an MIA and, to seek revenge, shoots Lin in the head, killing her.At a military station, Quoc ties Braddock's wrists and hangs him with his toes just touching the floor. Quoc explains the ties connect to a shotgun that will fire at Van if Braddock sets his feet flat on the floor. As hours go by, Braddock does not move. Frustrated, Quoc electrocutes Braddock to make him move. Nevertheless, Braddock stays on his toes. Growing impatient, Quoc forces Braddock's feet to fall flat on the floor, but no shell is fired. The boy is placed in a nearby cell as Quoc continues to electrocute Braddock. Braddock passes out and Quoc orders his guards to take him away.On the way to his cell, Braddock awakens and kills the guards. He frees Van and they run to the Amerasian Children's Mission. Quoc follows with reinforcements. At the Mission, Quoc finds Van, and orders him, Reverend Polanski and all the children taken to a prison. Afterward, Braddock returns to his boat for weapons and ammunition to attack the prison.The following morning, Braddock sneaks inside and frees Van and the children. He tells them to get into a nearby truck as Van releases Reverend Polanski. As they escape, helicopters fire at them. To lose the helicopters, Braddock drives into the jungle and orders the children out of the truck to hide.After the helicopters leave, Braddock leads Reverend Polanski and the children toward the Thai boarder 90 kilometers away, but the children are unable to complete the trek. Braddock sees an airfield and steals an airplane. As they take off, Quoc and his men arrive and shoot bullets into the plane, puncturing the fuel tank. Braddock radios for assistance from any U.S. Armed Forces stationed nearby. When the fuel runs out, Braddock lands the plane. The group wanders into the jungle and locates a bridge that crosses into Thailand. Braddock tells Reverend Polanski to guide the children after he has killed the soldiers guarding the bridge. Before going, Braddock tells Van he is proud of him and loves him.On the Thailand side of the bridge, CIA official Littlejohn tells General Duncan of the U.S. Armed Forces that Braddock and the Amerasian children are on the Vietnamese side. Braddock kills the Vietnamese soldiers, but is injured by a grenade. Seeing his father hurt, Van runs to Braddock as Quoc arrives in a helicopter gunship. As Quoc prepares to fire at Braddock and Van, two U.S. armed helicopters hover over the bridge, aiming their guns at Quoc. Van and Braddock shoot Quoc's helicopter, causing it to crash and killing Quoc. After the crash, Braddock, Van, Reverend Polanski and the Amerasian children cross the bridge and leave Vietnam for good."
1969,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094594/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two friends living in a small town during the 1960s, run away to enjoy their freedom during the Vietnam War, thus disappointing the father of one of them. When they return to town, they realize the importance of family unity. Two college students, Ralph and Scott, live in a small minded Maryland town at the onset of wide public dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War. While Scott's brother Alden enlists in the country's armed forces, he and Ralph are outspoken in their opposition to the war. Scott's attitude alienates him from his father and he and Ralph leave town to enjoy their freedom. But when Ralph is expelled from college, he suddenly becomes a prime candidate for serving the country's armed forces. When they learn Scott's brother is declared missing in action, the lifelong friends take drastic - and illegal - measures to ensure Ralph's freedom. This event proves to be the catalyst needed to bridge the gap between father and son and enlightens them both to the true cost of war.—MGM/UA Home Video Two best friends, Ralph Carr (Robert Downer Jr.) and Scott Denny (Kiefer Sutherland), are college students in a stuffy, upper-middle class suburban town in Maryland. The film begins with Ralph and Scott hitch-hiking from their college to their hometown on Easter weekend. The boys finally arrive on Easter morning and shout across the glen to their families during a lakeside Easter Sunday service, much to the amusement of Ralph's younger sister Beth (Winona Ryder) and mother Ev (Joanna Cassidy) and embarrassment of Scott's mother Jessie (Mariette Hartley) and father Cliff (Bruce Dern).Tensions quickly begin to brew when they find out that Scott's brother Alden has enlisted; Scott and Ralph are outspoken in their opposition to the Vietnam War, which alienates Scott from his father. Alden does not want his father to see how worried he is about going to Vietnam, but gives Scott his old Chevrolet Corvair convertible as a gift before leaving, a gift Scott reluctantly accepts. Late in the afternoon, the family has arranged to deliver Alden to the bus station where he will return to his Army base and prepare to ship off to Vietnam. However, Jessie does not wish to say goodbye, and refuses to join them, going out for a jog instead. On the bus, Alden notices his mother jogging along adjacent highway and asks the driver to pull over. He and his mother wave goodbye across the highway, and as he gets back on the bus, she says quietly ""Don't die"".Back at college, Scott is quizzing Ralph about ""Don Quixote"" in their dorm room, only to learn that Ralph has not even read the book. When he notices Ralph lighting a marijuana cigarette, he asks for a smoke; Ralph passes the marijuana cigarette, Scott throws it out of the window and warns Ralph not to flunk out of college at the risk of being drafted into the army. The same day, the boys received a surprise visit from Ev and Beth Carr and Jessie Denny; as the five of them head over to the cafeteria for lunch, they run into an anti-war rally occurring on the front steps. A riot breaks out when the police arrive, and when a young man beaten by police crashes into Beth as he runs from the officers, Scott rescues Beth while Ralph jumps in front of the police to stop them from accosting other students. Ev and Jessie are unnerved by the unnecessary violence against the protesters, and Beth finds herself growing closer to Scott as he comforts her.During Beth's high school graduation a few weeks later, Ralph takes LSD which Scott refuses to take. In his delirium while drugged, Ralph climbs on stage after the graduation ceremony is over, announces over the microphone to all present that he has flunk out of college, and goes into a seizure while having an overdose. After Ralph's hospitalization from this episode, he and Scott decide to spend the summer on the road, living out of their van (that Scott obtained by trading in Alden's convertible) and experiencing all the freedom the counterculture has to offer. However, since his overdose, Ralph does not feel as excited as Scott about the counterculture, and wishes to return home despite Scott's attempts to dissuade him. Eventually, the boys arrive back at their hometown in the middle of its summer festival. Ralph goes off to jump on stage with the rock band, and Scott heads over to the dunking tank to find his mother and father, and Ev setting out free soda at a nearby concession stand. When he notices that they all look anxious, Jessie reveals that Alden has been declared missing in action.Emboldened by the news of Alden disappearance, Ralph and Scott hatch a plan to steal their files from the local draft board office. Beth tags along to keep watch outside of the local Federal Building as Ralph and Scott break into the draft board office to find their own files. They quickly finds their own files, and discover that Ralph's file contains a notice that indicates he is eligible for the draft. Ralph decides to steal both of their files, but Scott develops cold feet and wants no part of this. Ralph is angry at Scott's reluctance and reminds him, ""Look, you can't stay in college forever--they will be calling you sooner or later."" Scott steals Ralph's cigarette lighter to keep him from destroying the two files.The local police notice Scott's van outside the Federal Building and stop to speak to Beth, who claims to be looking for her dog that got off the leash. They soon get suspicious when the supposedly lost dog appears just a few feet away, sniffing and barking near the draft board office's window, and they rush into the building. Scott runs from the room at Ralph's urging, and Ralph puts away Scott's file and hides into the office with his own. Ralph is soon found out, and arrested for the break-in. When Scott attempts to take equal blame for the break-in, Ralph lies that Scott has not part in this. The Dennys and Ev Carr arrive to find Ralph under arrest and Scott attempting to take equal blame, over Ralph's objections. The sheriff remarks that his own son came home paralyzed, so he certainly understands the boys' reluctance to go and serve. Cliff is furious about Scott's claims and declares that Alden would be ashamed of his actions, and Scott angrily declares that Alden is dead. Cliff disowns his son in front of the police, and Jessie reluctantly leaves the scene with her husband. Ralph is taken off to prison but informs Scott that he will take all the blame and that Scott should just go off and enjoy his summer of fun in the counterculture.Scott is now determined to avoid Ralph's fate and plans to leave town and head to Canada to avoid the draft. Beth finds Scott in his van and convinces him to allow her to join him on his trip. They admit their attraction to each other and make love in the van. The two later decide to visit Ralph in prison and inform him that they are leaving. Ralph reveals in a deadly sarcastic tone that he actually wants to go to Vietnam. When he finds out that his friend and his sister have had sexual relations, he disowns Scott and ignores Beth. Cliff is excitedly watching the first moon landing on television, but Jessie has a nervous breakdown over the news about her son's disappearance and orders her husband to just leave her alone. Cliff decides to visit Ev's house and ends up dancing and drinking with a drunken Ev, who is bitter about the loss of her husband and the impending draft of her son. This proves to be an ampler distraction for Scott to get Beth out of the house so they can leave for Canada. When Scott goes home to say goodbye to his mother, Jessie orders him to go to Canada and get as far away from here as he can.After a few days on the road, Scott and Beth get to the Canadian border and are about to cross when Beth realizes that running away for their families isn't going to help their cause. Scott reluctantly agrees and they head back to Maryland; when they get home, they learn of Alden's death. This event bridges the gap between father and son, enlightening them both to the true cost of war. Scott leads a huge march downtown in the middle of Alden's funeral, and is able to get Ralph out of prison so they can reconcile. The film ends with a narration by Scott, announcing that his family and friends join hundreds of thousands of other Americans towards Washington, D.C. to protest the Vietnam War."

Eight Men Out,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095082/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A dramatization of the Black Sox scandal when the underpaid Chicago White Sox accepted bribes to deliberately lose the 1919 World Series. A semi-fictionalized account of the scandal surrounding the 1919 World Series, coined the Black Sox Scandal, is presented. The Chicago White Sox, considered the cream of the crop and one of the best major league teams ever, has just won the American League pennant, and are odds on favorites to win the World Series against the Reds. While team ownerCharles A. Comiskeypublicly crows about the superiority of the team he has assembled especially in their cohesion, he is unaware that arguably the cohesion in the players' determination to win is matched only by their feeling of unappreciation by Comiskey, especially financially as he screws them over time and time again on promises made. Sensing an opportunity, professional gamblers begin to feel out who they believe may be sympathetic Chicago players to a game and/or series fixing scheme, especially lucrative seeing as the to the disparity between the two teams. There end up being eight players ""in"" to various degrees, from being the ""all in"" negotiators between the gamblers and the players, to those somewhat unaware of what is happening, to those just in the know but remain silent. Things quickly go off the rails as each individual and group is looking out solely for his own interest, from the disparate groups of players, to the gamblers, to the scheme financiers, to the team owners - Comiskey and others - as closely watching sports journalists can see that some of the Sox players are not playing as hard or as well as they can.—Huggo The great Chicago White Sox team of 1919 is the saddest team to ever win a pennant. The team is bitter at their penny pincher owner, Charles Comiskey, and at their own teammates. Gamblers take advantage of this opportunity to offer some players money to throw the series. (Most of the players didn't get as much as promised.) But Buck Weaver and the great Shoeless Joe Jackson turn back at the last minute and try to play their best. The Sox actually almost come back from a 3-1 deficit. Two years later, the truth breaks out and the Sox are sued on multiple counts. They are found innocent by the jury but baseball commissioner Landis has other plans. The eight players are suspended for life, and Buck Weaver, for the rest of his life, tries to clear his name.—Patrick Lynn <pjustinl@worldnet.att.net> John Sayles' recounting of the 1919 ""Black Sox"" incident, in which the Chicago team conspired with organized-gambling powers to throw the World Series.—Susan C. Mitchell <susanm@indirect.com> Eight Men Out tells the true story of the infamous 'Black Sox' scandal of 1919, in which the White Sox players deliberately lost the World Series. The movie places the scandal in the context of a labor dispute between the players and their then all-powerful team owner, and how mobster Arnold Rothstein took advantage of the dispute. The result was a human tragedy for players like ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson.—Reid Gagle Chicago, Illinois in the early fall of 1919. A couple of kids get tickets and run to go see the White Sox play the final pennant game to get into the World Series. In the press box, sports writers Ring Lardner (Director John Sayles) and Hugh Fullerton (Writer Studs Terkel) are passing around comments to one another about the players. Entering the room is ""The Old Roman"", Charles Comiskey (Clifton James), the owner of the White Sox along with a group of sports writers and press agents into a nice banquet room with hors d'oevre's and champagne with Comiskey bragging about his ballplayers and them winning. While he is talking about them, we get glimpses of the star players of the White Sox on the field, to include Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker), pitcher Eddie Ciccotte (David Strathairn), Eddie Collins (Bill Irwin), Swede Risberg (Don Harvey), Hap Felsch (Charlie Sheen in a small role), Buck Weaver (John Cusack), Ray Schaalk (Gordon Clapp), and the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney). While the game is going on, small-time gamblers Sleepy Bill Burns (Christopher Lloyd) and Billy Maharg (Richard Edson) are in the stands evaluating players who they think could be part of a plot to throw the World Series for some cash, since Comiskey grossly underpays most of his ballplayers compared to most other teams. They do not want Eddie Collins or Ray Schaalk to be part of it, since Collins is a college-educated man that gets paid well and Schaalk is too temperamental to even be considered part of it. Eddie Ciccotte is the key player they want because of his pitching record and nearing retirement in his late 30's.The White Sox win the pennant with Hap Felsch having caught the ball of the player in the outfield. The team wins and enters the locker room with Comiskey's secretary Harry Grabiner (Jack Merrill) giving them champagne for having won. They are delighted at having it, but it turns out the champagne is their bonus for having won instead of cash and all the team are disappointed. Their manager Kid Gleason (John Mahoney), tries to encourage them, but cut off and assured he's not part of their beef. Even more disappointing is the champagne turns out to be flat. Whereas Comiskey and the press agents are enjoying expensive champagne and hors doevre's giving him cheers. The team all poses for a group photograph.That night, many of the players are celebrating in a local gin mill. The illiterate Joe Jackson is having his wife read the paper to him about the day, Felsch, Risberg, Weaver, and utility player Fred McMullen (Perry Lang) are hanging around the bar area, and Chick Gandil is hanging out with a couple of ladies and a shady gambler, Sport Sullivan (Kevin Tighe), explaining his ordeal and Sullivan assures him he could get 6-7 men in to throw the World Series, but doesn't believe Gandil could engineer it, but Gandil reminds him of the cheapskate they work for. Burns and Maharg are also in the gin mill overseeing the conversation between the two with Burns believing Sullivan is just trying to get inside information about them.Gandil and Risberg are in the men's room using the urinals with Gandil explaining what he wants to do and McMullen overhears their conversation. Fearing exposure, Risberg lets him in on the projected fix the men will have on the World Series. After leaving the men's room, Burns and Maharg approach Gandil wanting to have a part in the bet presumably unaware that Sullivan already beat them to it. Gandil doesn't want to have more than one party, but Risberg facetiously asks ""what will they do, call the cops""?, if they have all of them.Back at his home, Ciccotte is having his wife rub balm on his arm to help get it prepared for the World Series. And Buck Weaver is going home from the gin mill with local boys wanting to play a little catch with him.Ciccotte is dismissing Gandil's idea about throwing the World Series that he has a secure income, but Gandil insists his time is running out. Ciccotte goes to visit Comiskey for his $10,000 bonus for winning 30 games, but Comiskey denies it to him that he won only 29, even though he was benched for 2 weeks. Ciccotte approaches Gandil at a depot requesting $10,000 in cash before the first game and Gandil is delighted he's in on the fix.At horse race tracks in New York City, Burns and Maharg approach former boxing Champion Featherweight, Abe Attell (Michael Mantell), since he's an alleged messenger for powerful gangster Arnold Rothstein. Abe brushes them off at first thinking they're just small-timers.Risberg is at pitcher Lefty Williams' (James Read) home trying to convince him to join the fix to throw the World Series, since they now have Ciccotte, and he concurs.We are introduced to Arnold Rothstein, a shrewd, aloof, impersonal businessman and one of the most powerful mobster figures in the country. Attell is at his home trying to convince Rothstein to be the man for the fix to throw the World Series, but he denies he's interested without hesitation because he knows how these people work and how this type of people tried to bring him down when he was a kid. Attell leaves and Rothstein gets an operator on the phone to get someone to come see him.Attell lies and tells Burns and Maharg at a bar that Rothstein is interested, but not to let any of the information to leak out unless they want the deal off.Rothstein is having dinner at his lavish home and Sport Sullivan enters telling Rothstein that he can get eight men in on the fix, to include Ciccotte, but Rothstein tells him to just wait and not say or ask anything more for the time being. Sullivan leaves.Sullivan is at a train depot telling Jimmy (Phillip Murphy) an employee of his, about Rothstein's home. An employee of Rothstein's, Monk (Stephen Mendillo), steps in and tells Jimmy to leave. Monk drops $80,000 in cash telling him that the fix is on, Rothstein is in and Ciccotte is to hit the first ballplayer at bat to signal that the fix is on. He's also instructed to not in any way connect Rothstein to the fix. Sullivan wants Jimmy to take some of the cash and place bets elsewhere and that some of the players will get money, nevertheless.The ballplayers and sportswriters Lardner and Fullerton are all on a train to Cincinnati for the first game. Hap Felsch is now being summoned to be part of the fix, but refuses unless Joe Jackson gets in. Buck Weaver overhears the conversation and is outraged that the men are talking about a fix. Sullivan is on board as well offering them a drink of champagne. Risberg visits Jackson in his dark quarters with Jackson doing an old wives tale of staring at a candle with one eye covered to make his batting eye better. Risberg tells him about the fix and the simple-minded Jackson can't understand why they're doing it or want him part of it, but he's intimidated by Risberg and concurs. Weaver is troubled by the men's arrangement in this proposed scandal.The men are now in Cincinnati and Gandil is visiting Attell with other ballplayers thinking the man is a bluff in it because of the lack of cash. Ciccotte is secretly asking Gandil about the cash and he's told to just look under his pillow, compliments of Sullivan.Buck Weaver is at the empty ballpark practicing for the series and Kid Gleason approaches him. He almost decides to tell Gleason about what he's heard, but declines.Ciccotte is looking out his hotel room at the commotion of a street crowd opposing the White Sox. He then goes to his bed and finds $10,000 in cash under his pillow.The first game is about to begin. Kid Gleason tells Lardner and Sullivan that he hears rumors all the time about a fix and denies his players would be part of it. They pretend to believe him and both secretly agree to keep separate score cards for any player they feel is not performing up to par and to compare afterwards. Jackson, feeling guilty about what he now knows, tells Gleason he doesn't want to play, but Gleason angrily tells him he will. Gleason gives a lecture to his club before the game to give it all they have.Game One begins. Arnold Rothstein is at a conference room in New York where the game is being transmitted into Morse Code for the audience. Ciccotte hits the first player with his ball and Rothstein leaves the room knowing the fix is on. Cicotte's pitching is not up to par, catcher Ray Schaalk is frustrated at Ciccotte, the Red's keep scoring, and Buck Weaver is giving 100% into the game. At the end of the game, the Red's have won. Risberg approaches Weaver inquiring about his playing abilities and Weaver tells him he will have no part in the fix and take no money.Cicotte visits Lardner in his hotel room with Lardner trying to tactfully question him if there is anything going on or a fix, but Ciccotte denies it and Lardner reluctantly believes him.Joe Jackson is sitting on the bed in his hotel room with McMullen entering and placing a small sum of cash on the dresser drawer. Jackson simply accepts it and does not get up.Game 2. Lefty Williams is pitching. He is messing up constantly and Schaalk even more outraged than the previous game. A small aeroplane drops a dummy onto the field mocking the ballplayers. Game 2 has been lost and Schaalk angrily attacks Williams for his incompetence on the field with Gleason and Weaver breaking them up. Gandil is laughing and joking with other players and Gleason is angered at his jovial attitude thinking he's trying to deliberately lose and attacks him being broken away.Outside the ballplayers hotel, an effigy of the White Sox is being burned by fans of the Reds and there are numerous trips being made in between hotel rooms. Comiskey is awoken by Gleason to come to another room to straighten out the situation and Burns and Maharg go to Attell's room demanding cash to bet on the third game and given $10,000. They are being stiffed, but have no other way. Newcomer Dickie Kerr is being summoned to be the pitcher for the third game.Game 3 of the World Series. Chick Gandil gets to first base, but another player makes a hit and he deliberately slows down to get thrown out at second base and the sportswriters know right away he did it on purpose. Dickie Kerr (Jace Alexander) makes his first pitch and throughout the entire game pitching a no-hitter. Burns and Maharg are very upset, since all the $10,000 was placed on them losing the game.Buck Weaver is sitting on the front porch of his home with his wife (Barbara Garrick) coming out to talk to him. He tells her of the fix and tells her he wanted no part of it, but she supports him for what he's doing on his part.Game 4 is poorly played once again with Weaver upset at Ciccotte's bad pitching.Games 5 and 6 of the World Series the players are performing up to par again, but the gamblers are all outraged, despite their disappearance in the fix and Gandil being unable to contact them. Feeling they've now been abandoned, the ballplayers go back to their top performance. Arnold Rothstein is informed by an employee of his while he's at the barber shop at the end of game 5. At game 6, Monk pays a visit to Sport Sullivan in the stands for failure to live up to the gamblers expectations. Kid Gleason is being interviewed and insisting that all along his players all gave their best. Sullivan, by the orders of Monk and Rothstein, has a man dispatched that threatens to have Lefty Williams' wife killed if he does not lose the 7th game.Williams pitches a pathetic and painfully bad first inning and taken out of the the series by Kid Gleason. Joe Jackson hits a home run, but it does nothing to alleviate the losing score of the White Sox' game. They lose the 7th and final game of the World Series. By the end, Fullerton has five of the players circled on his list, with only Jackson, McMullen (who played only briefly at bat) and Weaver.Within the next year, sportswriters Lardner and Fullerton have interviewed Schaalk, Maharg, and maybe others about an alleged fix and now there is a $1,000 reward being offered by Comiskey for any alleged gambling. Weaver and Jackson are made aware of what's going on through the newspapers.Eddie Collins visits Comiskey at his office telling him he believes there might have been a fix, but does not want any reward money.

Joe leaves the courthouse with a child in the crowd pleading ""Say it ain't so Joe"". Lardner now circles Joe as one of the suspects in the fix.Austrian tells the eight indicted players to simply cooperate and that they have the best lawyers to defend them. Weaver dismisses him that he's being paid off in this, but Austrian tells him as long as he doesn't know what's going on, he's better off.Austrian meets with Rothstein's lawyer that Comiskey and Rothstein both indirectly, but mutually agree to do away with the signed confessions.The ballplayers have their first day in court. Fullerton and Lardner are present with Fullerton telling Lardner it depends on where the ball rolls on what the verdict will be. They are all told before the testimonies they have conspired to commit a confidence game from a Charles Nims, possibly a pseudonym for Arnold Rothstein.Comiskey testifies that he only suspected them throwing the game, Burns testifies he was approached and did not profit at all from the fix, and Maharg testifies all of the players associated with the exception of Jackson, due to his confession before the grand jury. The judge (Dick Cusack, John's father), asks it to be brought forward, but the confessions were ""stolen"", more than likely paid off by Rothstein or Comiskey from the meeting their lawyers had.Ciccotte is home with his wife (Maggie Renzi) that night telling her his plans for her and the kids if he goes to jail and tells her of all the injustice with the powers that be and that they are the conspiracy.The next hearing, Collins takes the stand telling the lawyer he didn't know about it because of his limited association with the players due to personal differences, but only suspected it, and Weaver has an outburst with the judge because he refused to take part of the scandal and gave it his all.in the games.Jackson is with his wife at his home telling her he just wants to go back and play baseball and doesn't know what he'll do if he doesn't.At the next hearing, their manager Kid Gleason testifies his years in baseball defending them that people make mistakes in life and are human, but declares his ballplayers are the best he's ever had.Buck Weaver is out hanging around the brownstones in his neighborhood with the local kids and tells them not to be so hard on the players and about how hard life gets when you're older assuring them he will be on the field next year playing his heart out.At the final hearing, the ballplayers are all found not guilty in court. They all cheer, but Comiskey is outraged that he will make them pay for all this. That night, they have a lavish welcoming dinner for them at a hotel.Judge Landis is making a statement before the sportswriters, to include Lardner and Fullerton, that no ballplayer that gambles or hears anything about gambling and doesn't inform anybody, will never play baseball again. This is a private sector decision made the courts are not able to do anything about.In New Jersey in 1925, a young trio of baseball fans watching a minor league team are sitting in the stands wondering who this guy Brown is who's playing so well. It's Shoeless Joe Jackson and one of them knows it's him, but one denies it and another one doesn't know who Joe Jackson is. Buck Weaver is in the stands watching as well and tells them Joe Jackson was the best ever, but that's not the man on the field.After ""Brown"" being cheered for his playing, it's announced on the screen that Joe Jackson and the other banned players never played professional baseball again and that Buck Weaver tried to clear his name until his death with his appeals denied."

Along for the trip to Miami are Moses Hightower, Eugene Tackleberry, Larvell Jones, Debbie Callahan, Laverne Hooks, Tommy ""House"" Conklin, and Commissioner Henry Hurst, along with Harris and his right-hand man Proctor. A jewel thief named Manny has smuggled stolen diamonds. Manny's suitcase is accidentally switched with Lassard's identical suitcase at the airport in Miami. This gets Lassard and Harris kidnapped by Manny and his two henchmen Julio and Pete, with everyone, including Lassard's nephew, Sergeant Nick Lassard, in pursuit.—Todd Baldridge The cynical Captain Harris and his dim-witted lacky Lt. Proctor finally finds the goods he needs to push Commandant Eric Lassard out at the Police Academy: he is one year late for mandatory retirement. But before he retires, Lassard is chosen as ""Police Officer of the Decade"", and brings his favorite graduates Sgts. Hightower, Jones, Tackleberry and Hooks, Lt. Callahan, and new graduate Officer Thomas ""House"" Conklin to the National Police Chiefs Convention in Miami Beach to celebrate with him.Harris and Proctor decide to travel down to Miami Beach to discredit Lassard once again so Harris can attempt again to take over the police academy for himself. But Harris and Proctor are tricked into chartering an old rickety cargo flight down to Florida while the police academy group travels first class aboard a 747 plane.While there, the misfit police officers meet Lassard's nephew, Sgt. Nick Lassard of the Miami Police Department. The fun is complicated when he unwittingly takes a bag belonging to jewel thieves containing stolen merchandise.As the jewel thieves try to get the bag back, and Captain Harris tries to prove to Commissioner Hurst that he's the right man to replace Commandant Lassard, the usual hijinks ensue, including Lassard trying to guess the annual procedural demonstration.At the awards ceremony, when the jewel thieves kidnap Commandant Lassard, he goes willingly, thinking it is indeed the procedural demonstration. It launches a negotiation, which Captain Harris botches, getting himself captured as well. A chase across the Everglades ensues to rescue the oblivious and absent-minded Commandant. During the chase, Harris falls overboard and is nearly eaten by a large aligator, until Hightower dives into the water to rescue him and subdue the aligator. When the chase leads to the end, Lassard is held at gunpoint by the jewel thief's leader, still thinking that it's a demonstration. When Nick tells his uncle that this isn't a demonstration, the elderly Commandant knocks out the jewel thief by himself and captures him.The next day, when Commandant Lassard is giving his ""Police Officer of the Decade"" award and announces his retirement from the force, a loophole by Nick shows that his mandatory retirement is in fact optional and that he can retire anytime he wants to. Lassard then changes his mind about retiring much to great joy and applause."

Sometimes they can get temporary jobs selling tea, but mostly they must beg for money and keep out of the way of the police, but they can almost never avoid trouble.—Mattias Thuresson Fed up of being endlessly bullied by his older brother, Krishna sets fire to his motorbike, and his furious mother takes him to the nearby Apollo Circus and informs him that he can only come home after he earns Rs.500/- to pay for the damaged bike. Krishna agrees to this and finds employment with the circus. One day the boss sends him on an errand, and he returns to discover that the circus has packed up and departed. Alone, not knowing where to go or how to earn the 500 rupees he needs, he travels to the nearest big city: Bombay. Immediately robbed of what little he has, he follows the thieves and befriends them. He ends up in Bombay's notorious red-light area of Falkland Road near Grant Road Railway Station. One of the thieves, Chillum, a drug pusher and addict, helps him get a job on the ""Grant Road Tea Stall"" and changes his name to ""Chaipau."" He soon discovers that saving money among his new associates in his new surroundings is next to impossible. He also has a crush on young prostitute Sola Saal; he sets fire to her room and tries unsuccessfully to elope with her--which earns him a beating and relieves him of his job. He then works odd jobs to feed himself and look after Chillum, who cannot live without his drugs. He and his pals also break into an elderly Parsi man's place in broad daylight to rob him. One night several of his friends return home to get apprehended by the police and taken to a juvenile home, but Krishna escapes and returns to his world of drug pushers, pimps, and prostitutes. Will he ever be able to return to his mother?—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) This is a superb film that gives the viewer a bird's eye view into the plight of India's urban street children. It is done through the experience of young Krishna, an illiterate, country bumpkin of a boy, who is abandoned by his mother at a circus and told not to come home until he has five hundred rupees for having broken something that belonged to his brother. While Krishna is on an errand, the circus packs up and leaves town, and he is left alone to fend for himself. Krishna uses his last few rupees to travel to a city, which by luck of the draw turns out to be Bombay. Thrust into the life of the street children of Bombay, living among the pimps, hustlers, drug addicts, prostitutes, and throw away children that proliferate in India's urban settlements, a modern day jungle, Krishna struggles to survive. His resourcefulness holds him in good stead. He quickly develops some street smarts and forms attachments. He struggles to earn and save money, so that he can return home to his mother and the family whom he misses, only to be duped in the end by one whom he had trusted. His story breaks one's heart, as he learns some hard lessons in life.This is a gritty look into the underbelly and plight of Bombay's poor street children, who call the gutters of its filthy urban streets home. It is filled with the sights and sounds of this urban nightmare. An Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, this highly acclaimed film allows the viewer a peek at another culture, only to find that basic human needs and desires are universal."

Locked in a school closet during Halloween 1962, young Frank witnesses the ghost of a young girl and the man who murdered her years ago. Shortly afterward he finds himself stalked by the killer and is soon drawn to an old house where a mysterious Lady In White lives. As he discovers the secret of the woman he soon finds that the killer may be someone close to him.—Losman <losman@express-news.net> The film begins with a successful horror author returning to his hometown of Willowpoint Falls. Stopping at a cemetery to visit a pair of gravestones, he begins to tell his driver their story. On Halloween 1962, 9-year-old Franklin ""Frankie"" Scarlatti (Lukas Haas) tells a scary story to his classmates. Afterwards, two of school jokesters Donald (Jared Rushton) and Louie (Gregory Levinson) take Frankie's hat and toss it on a shelf in the cloak room. They let Frankie know where it is and then lock him in in the cloak room as he tries to get it back.At nightfall, Frankie is still locked in the cloak room and sees the ghost of a little girl re-enact her death. Afterwards, a darkened figure enters the cloak room and begins to unscrew the metal vent unaware that Frankie is still hiding in the room. A rat startles Frankie which alerts the stranger to his presence. The stranger attacks Frankie and he loses consciousness taking him into a dreamlike state where he speaks to the ghost girl. Frankie is revived by his father giving him CPR and rushed to the hospital. Police find and arrest the black school janitor Harold Williams who was found drunk in the basement.Frankie is soon released from the hospital and enjoys a comfortable recovery with his family. His brother Geno, brings a newspaper home which proclaims Frankie to be a star. Geno is reprimanded for making an inappropriate remark and the newspaper is thrown away. Secretly, Frankie finds the newspaper and reads the story regarding his attack which coincidentally links him to an on-going 10 year investigation into the deaths of 11 other children at the hands of a serial killer. Within the same article, he learns the name of the ghost - Melissa Ann Montgomery (Joelle Jacobi). Soon, Frankie sees the ghost of Melissa frequently and he befriends her. Her only request is that he help her find her mother.When he returns to school, Frankie finishes removing the grate cover on the airvent in the cloakroom and removes an odd assortment of children's objects. He singles out two things, a hairclip - which he assumes to belongs to Melissa as he saw something hard and shiny fly off her hair and drop into the grate during her struggle - and an old high school class ring. Frankie cannot figure out the significance of anything he found in the grate. A few more weeks pass and the seasons change.One day, Frankie overhears a conversation between his father and the chief of police. The chief readily admits that Mr. Williams is probably a scapegoat for the murders. The chief also explains that blood found within the cloakroom links that location to the murder of Melissa Montgomery - a fact not released to the press. In a flash, Frankie figures out that the killer came back for his class ring which he dropped into the airvent the night he killed Melissa.Unbeknownst to Frankie, the ring has fallen out of his pocket in his bedroom several days earlier (and picked up by Geno). Frankie relays his theories to family friend Phil. Several days later, Frankie is lured out to the cliffs by Donald and Louie and encounters a lady in white clothing inside an old abandoned cottage. All three kids run out of the house scared but Frankie realizes that she may be Melissa's mother and tries to explain the situation to Geno (who has come looking for him due to the late hour). Geno does not believe him but now understands the origin of the ring he found. Although he does not tell Frankie that he found the ring.Melissa's ghost haunts Frankie in a non-threatening way. She appears one night and even Geno sees her. Suddenly, both boys follow her as she re-creates her death scene at 10pm (it is implied that this happens every night). They are late arriving at the school and by the time they get to the front door, her ghost is seen being carried down the stairs (presumably dead) and back out of the school. This time, Frankie follows her but Geno is incapacitated by a thorn in the foot and cannot give chase. Alone, Frankie follows the body (that is being carried by an unseen person) out to the cliffs. There, Frankie sees that at the last minute, Melissa regains consciousness, screams and is thrown over the cliffs alive. Afterwards, Melissa's mother runs out of the old white cottage calling for her daughter. She sees Melissa's body at the foot of the cliffs and then throws herself over the edge. Geno finally catches up with a very startled Frankie and they both go home.Harold Williams, the black school janitor, who got drunk while watching a ballgame in the school basement on the night of Frankie's assault, is accused of the attempted murder of Frankie and the murder of Melissa and ten other children. This sets off instances of outrage in the community but Angelo Scarlatti (Alex Rocco), Frankie's father, believes Williams' claim of innocence upon failure to link the janitor to Frankie's assault and the fact that Williams is also a father. Williams is later freed when a grand jury decides against going to trial due to insufficient evidence, but he is then murdered by the mother of one of the victims (who believes him to be guilty).Meanwhile, Geno continues to investigate the ring that Frankie found in the vent. His father has an old trunk full of old sentimental objects and he notices that his father owns an identical class ring from the same school year. He realizes that the killer may be in the same graduating class as his father. Geno compares the initials on the old ring with his father's yearbook, and discovers that the murderer is family friend Phil. He frantically runs to tell his father and the police chief. Frankie, who is with Phil at that time, figures out the truth when Phil is whistling ""Did You Ever See a Dream Walking"" (Melissa's song) and unwittingly tips off Phil. Phil attempts to attack Frankie, but he escapes and runs to the cliffs. Phil chases him and admits to being the killer, but claims he had no idea he was attacking Frankie on Halloween. He explains that he wouldn't have done it had Frankie not been wearing his Halloween mask as he cares about him a great deal. Phil attacks Frankie by strangling him and demands the whereabouts/return of the ring. Suddenly he's struck from behind by an unseen person and both Frankie and Phil collapse.Frankie then awakens in the well-preserved bedroom (presumably the old cottage) which had been Melissa's, under the care of the woman who saved him, Amanda Harper (Katherine Helmond). She reveals that she is Melissa's aunt and has been despondent over the loss of her sister and niece. She also tells Frankie that she set fire to her own house in an attempt to take her own life in order to be reunited with her family, but was rescued from the blaze and subsequently branded the town crazy.Before she can finish her explanations, Phil sneaks into the cottage, attacks, and murders Harper. Several candles are knocked over during the struggle and a large housefire begins. Phil rescues Frankie from the burning cottage but only to try and throw Frankie off the cliff. Frankie puts up a great struggle and in the end is saved by the ghost of Melissa's mother (the true Lady in White) who scares Phil over the edge of the cliff. Having brought the ghost of Melissa with him, Frankie watches as she and the Lady in White reunite and ascend into the sky.Frankie attempts to crawl away from the cliff edge but is grabbed around the ankle by a struggling Phil (who's holding onto a lone tree branch). Frankie's father Angelo, Geno, the police, and hunters with scent-tracking dogs arrive. Angelo frees Frankie and tries to save Phil, but at the last minute Phil lets go and falls to his death. With Phil dead, the movie ends with the group watching as the cottage burns down while the snow begins to fall."
Another Woman,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094663/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Facing a mid-life crisis, a woman rents an apartment next to a psychiatrist's office to write a new book, only to become drawn to the plight of a pregnant woman seeking that doctor's help. Having recently turned 50, Marion feels that so far she has led a blessed life. The well-respected Dean of Philosophy at a women's college, she is currently on sabbatical to write her latest book. Although her first husband Sam died tragically 14 years ago from a mixture of alcohol and pills, she has recently married Ken, who had pursued her while he was still married to someone else and his writer friend Larry also professed his love for her. She has a good relationship with her stepdaughter Laura, seemingly better than Laura's relationships with either Ken or Kathy, her volatile mother. Between her and her brother Paul, Marion always had the attention of their academic father, and she and Ken have a wide circle of friends with whom they regularly, willingly socialize. But a series of incidents with these people in her life makes Marion wonder about the decisions that she's made, most specifically whether her cerebral and judgmental nature has been alienating to those around her. One of these incidents is her surprise reunion with her best childhood friend, actress Claire. But arguably the most illuminating incidents involve encounters with Hope, a despondent patient of her workspace neighbor, a psychiatrist whose therapy sessions Marion can hear through the building's ventilation system. Will Marion be fully able to comprehend the extent to which these decisions have negatively affected her life and relationships? If so, can she make the necessary changes at this stage in her life path to be more fulfilled?—Huggo Marion is a woman who has learned to shield herself from her emotions. She rents an apartment to work undisturbed on her new book, but by some acoustic anomaly she can hear all that is said in the next apartment, in which a psychiatrist holds his office. When she hears a young woman tell that she finds it harder and harder to bear her life, Marion starts to reflect on her own life. After a series of events she comes to understand how her unemotional attitude towards the people around her affected them and herself.—Leon Wolters <wolters@strw.LeidenUniv.nl> Marion Post (Gena Rowlands) is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope (Mia Farrow), who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way.
Shortly after, Marion is at her husband's 50th birthday party. In an embarrassing revelation of her friends, Marion learn that her sex life might not be as spontaneous as some others. On another morning, Marion is to meet her sister-in-law Lynn (Frances Conroy) who is running late. She wants to borrow money for their divorce. Marion's insensitivity is on display. Marion learns in that conversation that her brother, though he respects her, hates her.
On another afternoon, she overhears Hope discussing her lost chance at love in the therapist office next door. She reflects on her anniversary party where author Larry Lewis (Gene Hackman), Ken's friend, professed his love for Marion. Then Ken's ex-wife Kathy (Betty Buckley) shows up returning some items and interrupting the celebration by claiming Ken and Marion had an adulterous affair while she was in the hospital having her ovaries removed. Ken has a less than impassioned reaction and escorts Kathy out. Larry renews his pleas, but then accuses Marion of being as dispassionate as Ken.
Marion and her step daughter Laura (Martha Plimpton) travel to visit her father (John Houseman). Laura admires Marion but resents the way she handles people in her life. Old photographs spur memories of when she went off to college but her brother Paul (Dax Munna) was forced to work in a cardboard box factory. There is also a photo of her friend Claire with whom Marion has lost touch.
As they return to the city, Marion sees Hope on the street and takes off in a foot pursuit. Losing her, she runs into Claire (Sandy Dennis) and her husband Jack (Jacques Levy) exiting a theater. They head off for a drink at a bar where her husband hangs on every word Marion says. Claire is jealous and brings up the past when Claire took the attention of her boyfriend David accusing Marion of subtly flirting with him and encouraging his interest. Claire states this is the reason she withdrew from their friendship.
The next day, Hope has nothing to say in the therapist's office. Marion reflect on a poem about a black panther in a case whose only see his way out of the cage was death. Marion begins to see herself as judgmental and putting herself above others. Unable to work, she seeks out her brother Paul (Harris Yulin). He tells her that he feels she is embarrassed by him for pursuing his dreams rather than the paths of success that may have been open to him. However, at dinner that night, a former pupil tells Marion how she changed her life with the lectures in her class.
Not sleeping at night, Marion takes a rest in her workspace and has an introspective dream. First, Marion walks into the therapists office and tells the doctor that Hope's issue is she is deceiving herself. The doctor confides that she has been killing herself for most of her adult life. Then her father walks in and begins listing the regrets he has had in his life. Next, she is witnessing a scene played out on stage of her own marriage and the lack of passion in it. Then she chats with Larry Lewis and finds out about his life, his lack of regret and that she has become a character in his book. Then she is to witness her first husband's ""suicide scene"" in which his death was ruled strangulation. He felt he imparted a kind of strangulation he imparted on her, his former student, with his knowledge and opinions she seemed forced to accept. She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.
That night Marion and Ken are out with the Banks, friends of whom they are not particularly fond. When they return home, Marion questions Ken why they don't sleep together any more. That night Marion lies awake and remember when she gave a gift to the professor who became her first husband. She remembered the mask, the only thing she could afford, and how they kissed through it.
The next day Marion is in search of an anniversary gift for her husband. She wanders into an old antique store and finds Hope sobbing. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called ""Hope"". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore.
When Marion returns to the work space she overhears the conversation between Hope and her therapist where Hope is describing the encounter with Marion and how she met a woman who was really sad though she wasn't in a position where anyone would think she should be. She has led this cold cerebral life without feeling. Hope worries that she will follow the same path toward an empty life if she does not change. Hope recounted to her therapist that in the midst of their lunch, that Marion noticed her friend Lydia. Upon closer inspection she saw Lydia was there with her husband displaying mutual affection for each other. In the other room, Marion begins to cry. She realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry
At home, Ken hurries Marion to get dressed for their anniversary dinner and presents her with gift. Marion declares she isn't going anywhere. She tells Ken she saw him in the restaurant with Lydia. Ken confesses that their affair was a past thing and quite foolish. Marion says in a way she feels sorry for him because he has been as lonely as she has been, Ken doesn't realize he has been lonely, but Marion takes solace in the fact that at least she has come to recognize it.
In the days that follow, Marion gets little work done and walks in the streets. She visited her brother Paul who has chosen to stay with his wife even though they always fight. Marion seeks a clean start with Paul and Lynn. Marion walks with her step daughter and makes sure the pending divorce with her father will not affect their friendship. Marion also goes next door and tell the therapist about the acoustics that allow her to hear his patients. She inquires about Hope but Hope has left treatment and the therapist can't offer any way for Marion to meet her.
Marion resumes work on her book without interruption and it goes very well. One day she stopped to read the novel by Larry Lewis in which a character was based on Marion. In it, the narrator came to realize that Helenka (the Marion character) would certainly be loving and passionate if she put down her walls and allowed herself to feel. Marion reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful."

However, Perry leads her to a pavilion and introduces her to his new puppy, Max. April reminisces about the wild times she and her cousins spent at Two Moon Junction, and her attraction to Perry overtakes her. The two of them make love in a climatic scene, which is inter-cut with Chad having his bachelor party complete with a stripper. Afterward, April cries over again cheating on Chad.The following day, Perry prepares to leave. As he starts his truck, a Sheriff's deputy arrives. Aiming his rifle, he fires at Perry, but misses. Perry knocks the deputy unconscious, and leaves town with his puppy. Meanwhile at the church, April hesitates before walking down the aisle. Sheriff Hawkins informs Belle that Perry is gone.

The true story ofPatricia Hearst, a rich girl who was abducted by American revolutionaries in the 1970s. The time spent with her captors made her question her way of life and she joined forces with the cause that her abductors were fighting for.

Her attackers lock her in the trunk of a car, then transfer her to a locked closet where she remains for days (her only interaction with her abductors is shadows that open the closet door during most of this time). One kidnapper announces that his name is ""Cinque,"" (Ving Rhames) the general field marshal of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), the group responsible for the recent death of Oakland Public School Superintendent Marcus Foster. They plan to trade Patty for the freedom of their two friends serving time in prison for Foster's murder.Members of the group take turns brainwashing Patty with their philosophy and goals to improve society. One female captor explains that the SLA will demand that supermarkets distribute seventy dollars' worth of free food to every needy person in California, paid for by Hearst family money. Cinque, the group's black leader, forces Patty to record a statement, encouraging her father, Randolph A. Hearst, to support the SLA's food program, but he responds on a newscast that the plan would cost $400 million to implement.As the days pass, Patty sleeps constantly and grows weaker. Cinque sends another message to the media, stating his goal of creating a world in which African Americans can live safely, have access to good education, and be free from corporate tyranny. In time, food is distributed to the poor, but riots erupt and people are injured. Cinque gives Patty a choice of joining the revolution or being executed. She must also choose an SLA member to rape her. Patty agrees to join, and accepts the group's revolutionary ideals.On April 3, 1974, after having been blindfolded for the past two months, Patty's blindfold is finally removed and she meets Cinque and all the members of the SLA for the first time. They dress her in combat fatigues and give her a new name, ""Tanya"", and photograph her standing before the SLA's emblem. Patty records a message to her family, explaining that she has decided to join the SLA's righteous cause. In preparation for a bank robbery, SLA member ""Teko"" (William Forsythe) demonstrates how to use a gun, and afterward, expects sexual favors.During the robbery on April 15, Cinque announces that he represents the SLA and Patty Hearst has joined the fight. After they collect money from tellers' drawers, one of the robbers shoots a customer. Back at the hideout, they celebrate their successful heist, and Cinque compliments Tanya on becoming a symbol of the revolution. Nevertheless, Teko and ""Yolanda"" warn that they will be watching her closely.

Doctors determine that she is being truthful.At night, in an adjacent cell, Yolanda accuses Patty of telling authorities that she and Teko are to blame for SLA violence. She muses that they should have killed Patty early on.At the start of the trial, Patty is cross-examined. Although in tape recordings released to the public, she stated that she was not brainwashed, in court, Patty responds that she is not sure what happened during her ordeal. In closing arguments, the prosecutor states that Patty's story is not believable. He doubts that in her nineteen months of captivity, she pretended to be a revolutionary, or was too fearful to contact her parents or sisters or even try to escape once they released her from her closet confinement.The jury finds Patty guilty of bank robbery and using a firearm during a felony. On July 22, 1976, she is sent to the federal prison in Pleasanton, California to serve a seven-year prison sentence. During a visit, her father tells her that the Supreme Court denied her appeal.

Mr. North,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095665/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mr. North, a stranger to a small, but wealthy, Rhode Island town, quickly has rumors started about him that he has the power to heal people's ailments. The rumors are magnified by his tendency to collect negative charges and give shocks to anyone he touches. In his adventures he befriends an old man who is a shut-in and helps him rediscover the world.—Kevin <Kibble@vm.temple.edu> Summer in Newport, Rhode Island in 1926. A young man, a graduate of Yale, bored with the sameness of teaching, finds himself in town due to the hand of fate. Mr. T. Theophilus North offers his services as a tutor to the children of the wealthy families who have summer ""cottages"" (really mansions) along the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.
The opening finds him reading to three misbehaving children. He tries to be polite to them, but skips pages to end the ordeal. When the eldest calls him on the skipping she tells him, ""you're a hateful, ugly, horrible man and you shouldn't be allowed"". Theophilus agrees that he shouldn't be allowed, takes drumsticks away from one child, pushes another down and gives a static electric shock to the girl right on her nose. As he leaves, he suggests to their mother that they be encouraged to play with matches.
Mr. North rides a bicycle and only selectively follows the rules of polite society. He arrives at the front door of the Bosworth Cottage for an appointment with a potential client and causes a disruption that gets a maid, Sally, dressed down by Sarah Baily-Lewis. Dr. McPherson reports on her father, Mr. Bosworth's, health. Baily-Lewis, who called to get the Bible read to Mr. Bosworth before he dies, objects to Mr. North's quoted price; he offers discounts for reading in unintelligible languages. This exchange tickles Mr. Bosworth who hires North two-hours a day, three days a week.
Theophilus establishes a friendship with Henry Simmons, a gentleman's gentleman who is headman at the Venable Cottage and senior man at Amelia Cranston's boarding establishment (where all the best help live) after losing a game of nine ball at a billiard parlor. Among his many jobs, North teaches tennis lessons to a group of children who discover that he has electric hands. He also works at Mino's Chowder Shack, where he gets to eat like six fishermen.
Henry discovers him working at Mino's and shares a secret and a thing or two about Newport. He then invites North to meet Mrs. Cranston to enjoy some not so week, not peppermint, and certainly not tea. Henry and Amelia share their perspective of the Death Watch where relatives are in cahoots with a doctor to get an elderly lady or gent with money to give up their checkbook, pen, and signing power. Henry gets to sliding on the ice when he names Dr. McPherson as on retainer at the Bosworth Cottage for $15,000.
Galloper, one of the children from the tennis lesson, has Mr. North invited to read to his sister Elspeth Skeel who suffers from migraines. She asks him to touch her forehead with his magic hands and seems to be relieved of pain at his touch. Later Mr. Skeel objects to North's laying hands on his daughter and banishes him from the property.
Theophilus lives at the YMCA and is visited by Sally, the maid from the Bosworth Cottage, who warns him that Mrs. Baily-Lewis has hired a bouncer to keep him from visiting Mr. Bosworth. North bests the bouncer using jujitsu and is applauded by Bosworth's widowed granddaughter Persis Bosworth-Tennyson. Mr. Bosworth expresses his admiration of Barclay and notes that he had a home in Newport. North indicates he would enjoy visiting Whitehall with Mr. Bosworth who admits he suffers from a weak bladder and has been housebound for years. Later Theophilus offers some pills that his grandfather swears by as an ancient remedy for his problem. He also provides Mr. Bosworth with adult sized rubber pants and diapers just as the beautiful Persis arrives with tea and a formal introduction is made.
Mr. North encounters Sally at the Fourth of July celebration and they spend the day together. After dark at the fireworks display Theophilus attempts to seduce Sally, and she moans another man's name. Theophilus gets her to admit to loving Michael Patrick Ennis, III of Boston, who's family she worked for but left when the mother objected to Sally and her son's relationship. North tells Sally that she is good enough to be the wife of a Beacon Hill scion and encourages her to go back to Boston and tell Michael Patrick Ennis he said so.
Mr. North is summoned in the middle of the night to the Skeel home and asked to comfort Elspeth who is suffering from the worst migraine. Dr. McPherson objects and is invited to leave. North is invited to take a drive with Mr. Bosworth who has escaped from his home for longer and longer periods. Bosworth indicates his plan to purchase Whitehall and turn it into an academy of philosophy, to seek out deep thinkers from around the world and invite them to live and study, teach, and write at Whitehall.
Word has gotten out about what Theophilus has done for Elspeth and a group of people are waiting for his return to the YMCA seeking his curative touch. Dr McPherson swears out a warrant for the arrest of Theophilus North on a charge of practicing medicine without a license. Later a larger crowd of ailing wraiths accosts Mr. North at the Y and he escapes by climbing out a window; the crowd chases him through the city and he seeks Henry's help. Finally, he jumps off a pier and Henry picks him up in a cigarette boat to speed him away. When they return to shore the police arrest him on Dr. McPherson's warrant.
A trial is held where Dr. McPherson outlines the medical interventions Mr. North has made-prescribing pills to Mr. Bosworth and laying hands on Elspeth Skeel. Upon questioning Theophilus reveals the pills were peppermints and Mr. Skeel indicates Mr. North was acting upon his request. Mrs. Cranston makes an impassioned speech pointing out that Mr. North is thought to be a miracle worker because he takes no fee and everybody knows you can't buy a miracle. The case is dismissed and Dr. McPherson is held in contempt for demanding a conviction.
Mr. North is invited to the Venable's ball of the season and Henry canvases every butler and valet on Bellview Avenue to obtain a proper suit and accessories. Theophilus meets Buster and Amanda Venable and is introduced to their special guests, Mr. & Mrs. Michael Patrick Ennis of Boston; he realizes why he has been invited when he finds that Sally is now Mrs. Ennis. When Sarah Baily-Lewis is introduced and realizes that the maid she dressed down is now her social better, she seems to have a breakdown. Mr. Bosworth offers Theophilus the role of Trustee of his fortune which will go to the furtherance of the Whitehall Institute.
The movie ends with Theophilus asking Persis Bosworth-Tennyson to dance. He shocks her when he touches her, apologizes, and she replies that she only hopes it will happen often. They run off the terrace hand in hand and another spark ignites from the dark."

A young man meets and falls in love with a young woman at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. This area is known as Miracle Mile, and the whole movie takes place there.

Harry accidentally hears a mistaken phone call and a man tells that the United State has just started a nuclear war sending missiles against Soviet Union and in two hours Los Angeles would be hit by the enemy back missiles. Harry seeks out Julie and frantically tries to find a helicopter pilot to leave Los Angeles. Meanwhile the rumor is spread out and brings chaos to the city.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Harry finally meets the girl of his dreams--on the last day of Earth. Harry mistakenly picked up a ringing pay phone to learn that a nuclear war had already begun. Now with a ticking clock and a rioting city deteriorating around him, Harry must guide Julie to safety. But can he save himself as lawlessness becomes the norm and terror grips every living soul in the city?—Tim Kretschmann <Tim.K@VirComm.com> Harry Washello is a thirty-year-old Glenn Miller cover band artist and a resident of the Los Angeles neighborhood street known as Miracle Mile. He befriends Julie Peters, a youth volunteer, at the La Brea Tar Pits during a school field trip, where they immediately fall in love. They spend the afternoon together, and Harry meets Julie's grandparents, both of whom raised her but who are estranged and live in separate buildings. Ivan Peters buys Harry a tube steak from a food truck, causing Lucy Peters to cry. The awkward moment is brushed off when Harry and Julie arrange to meet at midnight to go dancing after her shift at a local coffee shop. A power failure caused by a hay bale burning up on the transformer means Harry's alarm fails to wake him, and a frustrated Julie leaves for home.When Harry awakens that night he realizes what has happened and rushes to the coffee shop, arriving at 4 AM. Harry tries to call Julie on a payphone, but only reaches her answering machine, where he leaves an apology. The phone rings as soon as the previous call ends and Harry answers, hearing a frantic man named Chip urgently warning that war will break out in less than seventy minutes. When Harry asks who is calling, Chip realizes that he has dialed the wrong area code. He pleads with Harry to call his father and apologize for some past wrong before he is interrupted and presumably shot dead. An unfamiliar voice picks up the phone and tells Harry to forget everything he has just heard ""and go back to sleep"" before disconnecting.Harry, confused and not entirely convinced of the reality of the information, wanders back into the diner and tells the other customers what he has heard. As the patrons scoff at his story, one of them, a businesswoman named Landa, places calls to politicians in Washington and finds that they are all suddenly heading for ""the extreme Southern Hemisphere"". She verifies the authenticity of certain elements of Harry's phone conversation and, convinced of the danger, immediately charters private jets out of Los Angeles International Airport to a compound in a region in Antarctica with no rainfall. Most of the customers and staff leave with her in the owner's delivery van. This includes Julie's fellow waitress and best friend Susie, a homeless vagrant named ""Spongy"", obese truck driver Harlan, businessman Mike, and an unnamed, neurotic airline stewardess. Roger, a transvestite, chalks up the issue to a mere prank and decides to stay behind. When the coffee shop owner refuses to make any stops, Harry, unwilling to leave without Julie, arranges to meet the group at the airport and jumps from the truck, briefly knocking himself out but regaining consciousness long enough to pull a carjacker and petty thief named Wilson over, hijacking his (stolen) car and bringing Wilson himself along for the ride. When Wilson figures out that a disaster is coming, he urges Harry to allow a brief stop to pick up his little sister, Charlotta, an environmental protester who does activism work near nuclear power plants nearby. While attempting to pump gas, Wilson and Harry are stopped by the police. Wilson spills gasoline on the police, but doesn't expect it when one policewoman fires her gun, accidentally setting herself on fire. Her partner and the gas station owner are also both killed in the process. Harry and Wilson are both guilt-ridden but continue to flee, hijacking the now abandoned police cruiser.Harry is able to locate Lucy and Ivan, as well as a sleeping Julie (passed out from having taken a Valium), but Wilson abandons them to search for Charlotta. Harry places Julie in a shopping cart, wrapped in a rainbow afghan blanket, and hurries to reach the helipad at the top of the Mutual Benefit Life Building, a tall financial skyscraper building where Landa said to wait for a ride to the main airport. He is saddened when Lucy and Ivan rekindle their romance but decide to drive away, wanting to die together. As Julie awakens, leaving the cart and the afghan behind, she innocently believes that Harry is taking her on a hot air balloon ride. She is horrified to be greeted by two unnamed businesswomen with Arctic clothing and machine guns, but finally learns the truth about the impending apocalypse. Mike, the businessman from the coffee shop, drunkenly waits atop the building for Landa to arrive, unaware that she has already left and probably isn't coming back for him or the other coffee shop patrons. Desperate to reach the airport himself and not having a car, Harry finds a gym rat at a local health club who offers to fly the helicopter for a financial fee, provided that his girlfriend, Leslie, is allowed to come along. They agree to all meet up at the Mutual Benefit Life Building, but unfortunately Julie has also tried to find a pilot on her own, and in the moments it takes for Harry to find her, Los Angeles descends into violent chaos. Wilson and Charlotta are both mortally wounded when they try to pull over to pick up Harry and end up crashing into a department store. After Charlotta dies in Wilson's arms, Wilson begs Harry to shoot him, but dies himself before Harry has to go through with the deed. Harry and Julie leave the deceased friends only to find the outside streets in a traffic jam. Rampant looting, public sex and shooting occur, and Harry has to hide in a storm drain after nearly being shot to death himself. There is still no confirmation that the nuclear holocaust is real, and Harry wonders if he has sparked a massive false panic in the example of Chicken Little. However, when he uses a phone booth to contact the father of the man who called him (using the number of the booth and the area code the man was trying to use), he reaches a man who says his son, Chip, is a soldier. Harry tries to pass on the message he was given, but the man hangs up before Harry finishes.Julie and Harry meet up again in the elevator of the Mutual Benefit building but fear that they will die before they can reach the helipad. Luckily they make it to the top of the Mutual Benefit building, but they find the pad empty, with only Mike on the roof, drunk and on drugs, awaiting his own fate as Landa has abandoned him there. Any doubts about a false alarm are eliminated when a missile can be seen streaking across the sky. Harry and Julie expect to die there, huddling in the elevator shaft, but they are relieved when the pilot arrives, the gym rat from earlier that morning. He is bleeding heavily and has appeared to have lost Leslie to the violence in the streets below, but he declares that he intends to keep his promise of rescue to his two new friends. After the trio lift off from the roof, several warheads hit and the nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the detonations ruins the controls. The already-injured pilot, dazed and bleeding to death, is unable to save the helicopter and it crashes into the La Brea pits. The pilot is killed instantly on impact, but Harry and Julie are left alive and panicked as the helicopter's cabin fills with natural asphalt tar, which will drown them both. Julie is horrified by all the chances that they had to escape if not for the various events of the past few hours. Harry tries to comfort her by saying that someday their fossils will be found and they will probably be put in a museum, or maybe they will take a direct hit and be turned into diamonds. Julie, accepting her fate, calms down and takes comfort in Harry's words, and the movie fades out as the tar fills the compartment. A final explosion seems to imply a direct hit has taken place, killing the characters."

My Neighbor Totoro,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby. Two young girls, 10-year-old Satsuki and her 4-year-old sister Mei, move into a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.—Christopher E. Meadows <cmeadows@nyx.cs.du.edu> On a warm, sunny day, 10-year-old Satsuki (English:Dakota Fanning; Japanese:Noriko Hidaka) and 4-year-old Mei (English:Elle Fanning; Japanese:Chika Sakamoto) Kusakabe drive with their father, Tatsuo (English:Tim Daly; Japanese:Shigesato Itoi), along a rural road towards their new home. The girls are excited about the move since it will bring them closer to their mother, Yasuko (English:Lea Salonga; Japanese:Sumi Shimamoto), who is ill in the hospital (it is implied that she has tuberculosis).Their house is old and falling apart in places, but the girls find it charming and set out immediately to explore. They open all the windows and doors before daring to venture up the stairs into the attic. Faint rustling is heard in the darkness above before an acorn falls down the steps. Intrigued, the girls go up and yell at the darkness. When nothing responds, Satsuki runs to the opposite end of the attic to open the window as Mei notices dark, fuzzy things in the wall, staring at them intently. Satsuki goes back downstairs but Mei's curiosity is piqued. She reaches a tentative finger into a crack in the wall and startles a mess of black sootballs, one of which she is able to capture between her hands. Back downstairs, she runs into Granny (English:Pat Carroll; Japanese:Tanie Kitabayashi), an elderly next-door neighbor who's been watching over the house. Granny notices Mei's and Satsuki's hands and feet covered in soot and exclaims that they must have stumbled upon susuwatari, or soot sprites, which will most likely leave soon now that people are in the house. Her grandson, Kanta (English:Paul Butcher; Japanese:Toshiyuki Amagasa), emerges outside and shouts that the house is haunted. Granny scolds him and he runs off.That night, the family enjoys a bath together while the house moans and creaks from the wind. The girls become anxious, but their father encourages them to laugh, saying that their laughter will encourage any spirits in the house to disperse. Sure enough, as they laugh together, the clan of susuwatari leaves the house through the roof and drifts away on the wind.The next morning, Satsuki cooks and assembles lunch for her family. She places Mei's lunch in a bento box and says farewell as she heads off for school. Tatsuo, a professor at a local university, works from home while Mei plays outside. As she plays, she notices two white, rabbit-like ears poking out of the grass. She watches as the figure, a small, semi-transparent creature, walks past her towards the house. She follows it until it runs off and hides under the porch. It emerges with a larger, blue companion carrying a bag full of acorns, and they attempt to sneak past Mei. However, she quickly notices them and chases them to the edge of the woods. She follows them up a path through the shrubbery, losing her hat in the process, to a large camphor tree where they disappear into a hole beneath the roots. Mei falls into it and lands in a mossy hollow where she meets a large, slumbering version of the creatures she followed. It identifies itself with a series of roars that Mei interprets as Totoro (a mispronunciation on her part of tororu, the Japanese word for troll). Mei falls asleep on Totoro's furry belly. (Mei's adventure -- following rabbit-like creatures and falling down a hole, like Lewis Carroll's Alice -- is one of several references the movie makes to older children's stories.)Satsuki arrives home from school to find Mei missing. She and her father search for her until Satsuki finds Mei's hat near the edge of the woods. Following the same path Mei took, Satsuki and her father find her sleeping in a clearing within the bushes. Confused, Mei tries to retrace her steps back to the tree where she found Totoro. When she becomes upset that she can't find it again, Tatsuo explains that she must have come into contact with a spirit of the forest who probably doesn't want to be found right now. They walk together around the property to the large camphor tree that Mei fell into and offer their respects to the spirits for watching over Mei.That afternoon, the family takes a bike ride further into town to see the girls' mother. They pass Granny and Kanta working in rice paddies, and Kanta and Satsuki blow raspberries at one another. At the hospital, the girls tell their mother how wonderful the new house is, and Mei brags that when Yasuko is well enough to come home she will sleep with her in her bed. The family enjoys their time together and Yasuko brushes Satsuki's hair.One day at school, Satsuki is surprised to see Mei and Granny waiting for her outside. Although Mei was given into Granny's care that day while Tatsuo went to university, she wants to be with no one but Satsuki. Satsuki agrees to let Mei stay in school with her, with the teacher's permission. As they walk home that afternoon, a rainstorm comes upon them unexpectedly. Satsuki and Mei take shelter under the roof of a small shrine until Kanta approaches and silently offers them his umbrella, though he does so with a little abrasiveness to hide his kindness. Later on, Satsuki and Mei return the umbrella to Kanta's mother (who had not known about Kanta's kind act, though he was pleased with himself) before walking to the bus station to wait for their father.While the sisters wait in their rain gear, with an extra umbrella, Mei grows tired and Satsuki places her on her back to sleep. Satsuki suddenly sees two clawed feet stand next to her. She looks up to see none other than Totoro waiting beside her. When she sees that he has nothing to shelter him from the rain but a large leaf, she offers him the extra umbrella. Pleased with the shelter and the noise the raindrops make on the umbrella, Totoro roars with joy as headlights appear down the dark road. Satsuki becomes puzzled when the headlights start to bounce. A bus does appear, but one that is mainly a large cat. Catbus grins widely at them as Totoro hands Satsuki a leaf-wrapped package before getting on and departing. (With its wide mouth and face, striped body, and ability to disappear, Catbus bears more than a passing resemblance to Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat.) Tatsuo arrives on the regular bus, apologizing that he ran late. The girls walk home with him and open their package to find that it's filled with acorns. They go outside to the garden and plant them.That night, Satsuki and Mei are awakened by sounds outside and discover Totoro (who has Tatsuo's umbrella) and his company of smaller totoros walking around the garden in a procession. They join them outside and mimic their dancing to encourage the acorns to grow. Saplings spring up and quickly grow larger before merging into one giant tree (à la Jack and the Beanstalk). As the girls cheer, Totoro pulls out a large, spinning top and stands on it. The girls cling to the fur on his belly and he flies into the air (still carrying the umbrella, like Mary Poppins), up the trunk of the tree. They sit on the high branches together, making music with hollow gourds.The next morning, the girls wake up to find the tree gone. However, they notice that the seeds they planted have already started to sprout.During one afternoon, the girls enjoy a picnic with Granny, who has prepared a fresh meal of vegetables grown from her garden. She tells them that fresh vegetables will help their mother get better. A telegram arrives for Tatsuo from the hospital. Worried for her mother, Satsuki rushes to Kanta's house to phone her father. After contacting the hospital, he calls her back to say her mother is fine, but won't be able to come home that weekend due to a set-back in her treatment. Despite his assurances, Satsuki takes the news hard and yells at Mei when she fails to understand why their mother can't come home. Granny explains to Satsuki that their mother should be fine but Satsuki begins to cry and fears that her mother will die. Mei sees this and decides to go to the hospital to give her mother an ear of corn so that she will feel better. No one sees her go.By the time Satsuki notices that Mei is missing, she is long gone. The entire neighborhood pitches in to search for her while Satsuki runs everywhere, remorseful for having yelled at her. One tense moment yields to relief when Satsuki identifies a shoe found in a nearby pond as not belonging to Mei. Still desperate to find Mei, Satsuki runs home and asks permission to enter Totoro's realm. She finds the hole in the roots where Mei fell in and stumbles upon Totoro. She tearfully begs him to help her find Mei. Happy to be of assistance, Totoro takes Satsuki to the top of his tree and summons Catbus, who takes her straight to Mei, sitting alone by the side of the road. After hearing that Mei got lost on the way to the hospital, Catbus offers to take them there.Perched in a tree outside their mother's window, the girls see their father visiting. They leave Mei's corn on the windowsill and write a get-well message on the husk. Catbus takes them home.The end credits show Mei's and Satsuki's mother finally coming home, with scenes of the children playing with friends while Totoro and the other spirits watch them, unseen."

He falls deeply in love with the woman, despite the fact that he knows virtually nothing about her. She insists on not being married in a church, and after they are married, some bad things from her past begin surfacing in subtly supernatural ways, and he must find the best way to deal with them without destroying their relationship.—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> Alan Desland (Rupert Frazer) is an English antique dealer living in Dorchester, England who specializes in ceramics. A solitary man, he is a bachelor with no romantic ties. On a business trip to Copenhagen, Denmark he hires a raven-haired, German-born secretary, named Karin Foster (Meg Tilly), to do some clerical work-she is fluent in English, Danish, and German. Alan's attraction to Karin is immediate, and over the next several days, he falls deeply in love with her. Karin is an attractive, sensuous, and mysterious woman who reveals little about herself. Her actions reflect both a quiet sensitivity (crying during a classical concert) and a dispassionate coldness (breaking the neck of an injured seagull). During a conversation about Karin's unmarried friend Inge and her child, Alan makes an off-hand comment that he would have trouble marrying a woman with a child..... the remark clearly upsets her. Before leaving Copenhagen, Karin expresses her love for Alan, who responds by proposing marriage, and Karin accepts.Alan returns to England and meets with his mother where he tells her all about Karin and that he is engaged to marry her. Alan's mother expresses concern that they know very little about Karin's family or her own background. When Karin arrives, Alan begins to notice her strange behavior; frightened by the sound of children and fearful of the dark. As they prepare for their wedding, Karin states she cannot be married in a church. Karin's playful sensuality, however, overwhelms and enchants Alan. Alan and Karin soon travel to the United States on holiday and get married in a civil ceremony in Florida, where they spend their honeymoon. While swimming in a lake, Karin sees a body beneath the water, but Alan confirms it's only an old log.When Alan and Karin return to England, she continues to captivate him and their entire social circle, engaging in discussions of philosophy and religion. At one dinner party, she asks Alan's best friend and vicar, ""Can anything be forgiven?"" He tells her yes, if a person truly wants to be forgiven. Alan suspects there is something deep and troubling in her..... some dark secret or hidden guilt.One day at an auction, Karin bids on an odd lot that contains a rare statuette of a girl in a swing. Overjoyed at the find, Alan authenticates the piece at Sotherby's which estimates its value at over £200,000. He becomes even happier when the initial impotence of his wedding night gives way to an unbridled, hot and heavy sexuality between the two. In conversations with Alan and the vicar, Karin explores the connection between spiritual love and physical love-a notion she believes is absent in Christianity but embraced by pagan cults. Soon after, Karin tells Alan she is pregnant.Alan's initial joy is offset by strange events and apparitions. He sees a green tortoise toy pillow appear and then disappear, and he hears a child's voice on the phone-something Karin also hears. Karin tells Alan she wants to receive Holy Communion. At Mass she is disturbed by the vicar's sermon on the commandment against killing, and then at the communion railing, she takes the Eucharist in her hand, but does not receive it, and soon collapses. At home Alan tries to reassure her that whatever's past is past, but she says, ""Nothing is past."" Karin continues to hear a child crying in the garden.When Mrs. Taswell comes to deliver letters, Alan also hears the child crying in the garden. They go to investigate and find a doll faced down in the water fountain. Alan returns to find Karin hysterical.

Alan sees the green tortoise toy again in the bedroom.The next day, Karin asks Alan to take her away. Before leaving, he discovers the receipt for the green tortoise toy and realizes to his horror that she bought it for her daughter just before killing her, out of fear that Alan would reject her with a child. Realizing the damage caused by his ""careless words"" in Copenhagen, Alan cries out, ""May God have mercy."" They drive to a beach, where she walks into the surf. She pours water over her head in a gesture of baptism, and he tells her he knows what she did. She takes all her clothes off, hands him her wedding ring, and they make love on the beach. As the waves roll over them, she faints in his arms.At the hospital, Alan watches over her, hearing her last words in German, ""I had no pity."" The next day he is told she died during the night. The doctor confirms she had an ectopic pregnancy, and that she had previously given birth.At an inquest hearing, while giving testimony, Alan sees an apparition of Karin in a hooded cloak at the back of the courtroom. When he realizes it really is just an apparition, he breaks down in tears. Haunted by his careless words, Alan understands that his ""need for a tidy life"" resulted in the tragedy.

The Reader,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095511/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A multi-faceted film based on Raymond Jean's novel ""La Lectrice"". Constance (Miou-Miou) reads the novel aloud in bed to her lover. Inspired by the story of Marie, a woman who advertises her services as a reader of literature, Constance decides to do the same. Here the film takes on a kaleidoscopic effect as the lives of Constance and Marie become merged, making it hard to distinguish what is real and what is fantasy. This structure is further complicated when the lives of Constance's clients become tangled with the stories she reads. The film is interspersed with readings from well known literary sources as diverse as, amongst others, Baudelaire, Duras, Tolstoy, Lewis Carroll and de Sade's ""120 days...""—Michele Wilkinson - University of Cambridge Language Centre"

"Distant Voices, Still Lives",1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095037/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The lives of an English working-class family are told out of order in a free-associative manner. The first part, ""Distant Voices"", focuses on the father's role in the family. The second part, ""Still Lives"", focuses on his children. The second film in Terence Davies's autobiographical series ('Trilogy', 'The Long Day Closes') is an impressionistic view of a working-class family in 1940s and 1950s Liverpool, based on Davies's own family. The first part, 'Distant Voices', opens with grown siblings Eileen (Angela Walsh), Maisie (Lorraine Ashbourne) and Tony (Dean Williams), and their mother (Freda Dowie) arranged in mourning clothes before the photograph of their smiling father (Pete Postlethwaite). Soon after, the family poses in a similar tableau, but for a happier occasion - Eileen's wedding. While relatives sing at her reception, Eileen hysterically grieves for her dad, and recalls happy times of her youth. Tony and Maisie's memories, however, are more troubled. Davies intermingles and contrasts scenes like the family peacefully lighting candles in church with the brutal man beating his wife and terrorizing his young children. In 'Still Lives', set (and filmed) two years later, the siblings are settled in life, but not all happily. For Eileen, relief from her drab existence comes only when singing at the pub. With his skillfully composed frames and evocative use of music in place of dialogue, Davies creates a lovely, affecting photo album of a troubled family wrestling with the complexity of love.—Anonymous This film follows no rigid plot as it has a strong dreamlike quality and flicks between different memories. Songs are sung in the pub on many occasions and these happy moments of solidarity serve to contrast with the strong strains we see the characters facing."

A young man, wearing a red biker suit, enters the bar and gathers some friends from a back room, announcing that they will be going after the Clowns, a rival bike gang, on Route 5. Outside, a younger teen, Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki, English:Jan Rabson), is admiring a bright red motorcycle with special technical features. Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata, English:Cam Clarke), the youth in the red suit and the leader of the Capsules biker gang, walks out of the bar and mocks Tetsuo, telling him he doesn't possess the skill to operate the bike, which belongs to Kaneda. The bosozoku gang rides out into the night.They meet the Clowns at the designated area, chasing them through the skyscraper district where the Clowns are knocked off their bikes. Bystanders watch as nearby cars are damaged and bombed by the violence. In the skirmish, Tetsuo wipes out and is left alone as the police arrive and the gangs split up.A wounded man, dripping blood, leads a short, green-skinned person through the night streets. He pulls a gun and shoots a pair of pursuing dogs. The man is eventually stopped by police near a group of rioting protesters and, in the chaos, is shot to death. The little green person cries out in terror as a building begins to collapse. The crowd scrambles for safety and a moustached man and his companion, a young woman named Kei (Mami Koyama, English:Lara Cody), are split up.Meanwhile, Kaneda's gang continues to pursue the Clowns. Tetsuo chases a Clown on his own and they approach the scene where police are attempting to hold back rioters with water cannons and tear gas.

When Tetsuo looks up, he sees the green person standing in his path. There is a crash and an explosion. Kaneda and the rest of the gang arrive on the scene to find Tetsuo semi-conscious in the street while the green person walks away, unhurt.

A second green-skinned person then arrives in a hovering chair and speaks to the other in a child's voice, beckoning him to return and saying 'there is no escape'. A helicopter with an armed paramilitary group lands in the square and forces the Capsules gang to the ground as a tall man with a jarhead haircut emerges from the helicopter. Colonel Shikishima (Tarô Ishida, English:Tony Pope) sends Tetsuo to the hospital while Kaneda and his gang are taken into custody before he leaves in the helicopter with the two green children.At the police station, Kaneda and his gang are interrogated, while feigning innocence. Eight of the Clowns have been put in the hospital, but they come up with an alibi; Being that they were going to visit his dying mother and got attacked by the clowns. The police check their alibi put them on a bench, where several members of the street riot are also awaiting interrogation. Kaneda notices Kei being held with another group of suspects. Suddenly, a radical member of the freedom revolution goes mad and activates a grenade in the middle of the station, attempting to kill himself and the police. The grenade, however, turns out to be defective, and the nearby police subdue him. The other police officers then inform the capsules that they have contacted their school and therefore find their alibi plausible, releasing them from custody. Kaneda uses this as an opportunity to free Kei as well by stating that she's one of them too. Unknown to him, she is a member of a terrorist organization though she teases him for attempting to flirt by freeing her before she slips away. Still not knowing her name, Kaneda yells at her, right as an explosion happens at the police station.Meanwhile, at the hospital, Tetsuo is placed in a full-body scanner. His status is overseen by Doctor Onishi (Mizuho Suzuki, English:Lewis Arquette), who suddenly makes an alarming discovery. He contacts Shikishima who is in a meeting with a politician, discussing a possible 'mole' on the Executive Council. Arriving at the hospital, Shikishima is told by Onishi that Tetsuo possesses psychic abilities similar to Akira, a young esper like the two green children, who caused the nuclear-like destruction of Tokyo 31 years prior. Project Akira was sprung from a secret government lab run by a dissident, underground terrorist group, but there was an error involving the growth pattern. Onishi claims that Tetsuo possesses the key to solving that dilemma. However, Shikishima is concerned about Tetsuo's power and, after receiving a prophesy from the esper Kiyoko (Fukue Itô, English:Melora Harte) envisioning Neo-Tokyo's destruction, instructs Onishi to kill Tetsuo if he thinks the power might get out of control.Once awakened, however, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital and makes his way toward the hideout for the Capsules gang in a vandalized wreck of a building.

They are then confronted by three Clowns who accost Kaori and threaten to torch the bike. Kaneda and the rest of the Capsules arrive and help Tetsuo fight off the Clowns. Tetsuo, however, angry at having to be rescued, takes his frustrations out on a fallen Clown, kicking him fiercely. He begins to suffer a severe migraine, hallucinating that his internal organs have dropped out of his lower chest and hearing the word 'Akira'. Not a moment later, a CRC team arrives by armored vehicle and helicopters. Having pinpointed his location via a scanning device, Doctor Onishi has Tetsuo taken back to the hospital, leaving Kaneda and his gang to wonder about what's going on.Nearby an explosion rocks a building and police shoot and kill fleeing armed men. Kaneda is drawn to the violence and sees a moustached man fleeing with Kei. Kaneda follows her as police flashlights bracket her attempt to escape. Kaneda assists Kei in escaping as a cop is shot and killed. When they reach the resistance headquarters, Kei frantically calls out for the moustached man named Ryu (Tesshô Genda, English:Bob Buchholz), while Kaneda tries to convince her to turn herself in for killing the officer (not knowing what's really happening). Just then, Ryu and some resistance fighters arrive and, mistaking Kaneda for a spy, lock him up inside a room. There, they discuss their earlier failed attempt at kidnapping #26, which turns out to be the first green esper child, Takashi (Tatsuhiko Nakamura, English:Barbara Goodson). He proposes a new plan to gain access to a government facility to find what they can on the newest subject: Tetsuo. After being discovered eavesdropping, Kaneda explains to the suspicious group that he and Tetsuo are best friends from the same gang and that he can help. Ryu seeks advice from a short, old man named Nezu (Hiroshi Ôtake, English:Mike Reynolds) who speaks of Akira as a symbol for hope and change while he watches the fires and protests in the city streets from afar.Meanwhile, Tetsuo experiences memories from his days as a boy. Suddenly, his memories turn into a nightmarish hallucination. Colonel Shikishima approaches an aged green-skinned esper girl; Kiyoko, sitting inside a crib while Onishi scans readings. Kiyoko is seen to have a '25' tattooed on her palm. She makes an ominous prediction. Shikishima flies out with a few scientists and don parkas before entering a large, oval-like facility. They enter the frigid space and begin activating some of the equipment within. A massive door slowly opens and the Colonel enters the cavernous chamber. A small, red light and sign reads 'Akira 28'.Colonel Shikishima then attends a meeting with the Supreme Executive Council where he is angered by the members' refusal to further fund his project. He questions them, stating that his intents are the duties of a soldier before he angrily, and abruptly, leaves. Council member Nezu smiles at the Colonel's distress.In his hospital room within the government facility, Tetsuo experiences bizarre hallucinations of a toy rabbit, a teddy bear, a toy car and milk. Confused about what's happening, Tetsuo steps out on a glass and cuts his foot which startles the three green children responsible for the hallucinations; Takashi, Kiyoko, and Masaru (Kazuhiro Kandô, English:Bob Bergen). Frightened at the sight of blood, the esper children flee despite their attempt to kill Tetsuo. Angered and realizing the power he holds, Tetsuo chases after them through the hospital, killing anyone who stands in his way and wreaking havoc with his telekinetic abilities.Meanwhile, the Resistance group, having made it into the facility disguised as electrical workers, are spotted sneaking in the sewers and a chase ensues. During the violent shootout, Kaneda manages to take over a flying platform, a small aerial vehicle flown by soldiers, and takes Kei as they flee the scene. However, they are quickly detained by soldiers. Using Kei as a medium and possessing her, Kiyoko leads them to a government nursery where Tetsuo is located. Kaneda faces Tetsuo, explaining that he's here to rescue him, but Tetsuo won't have it. He angrily retorts that he needs no rescuing now and, since he's discovered where Akira is, is eager to find out what he is, hoping to make his headaches go away. Possessing stronger powers than the three espers, Tetsuo manages to escape and uses his abilities to fly away; his destination is the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Stadium under which Akira is being held in a cryogenic storage facility.Desperate to find and stop Tetsuo, Colonel Shikishima places Neo-Tokyo under martial law. Tetsuo leaves a trail of destruction through the city before he stops at the bar seen at the start of the film, still wearing his hospital gown, and approaches the bartender, now alone. Tetsuo demands 'capsules' before we see two of his fellow Capsule gang members, Yamagata (Masaaki Ôkura, English:Michael Lindsay) and Kai (Takeshi Kusao, English:Matthew Mercer) walk in from outside. They find the inside of the bar totally destroyed and the bartender lying dead as Tetsuo sits on a pile of rubble and furniture, giggling. Perplexed and disgusted, they wonder if the person they see is really Tetsuo or someone else. Tetsuo speaks to them cryptically before intimidating and attacking them.Having been left behind and locked once more in a holding cell, Kei is used again by Kiyoko to speak to Kaneda, warning him of Tetsuo's immense power. The cell door unlocks and the two escape. Meanwhile, a government representative arrives to arrest Shikishima but the Colonel's men remain loyal to him and assist the Colonel in a coup d'etat. He mobilizes his men to the stadium. Nezu, the government mole, listens to this report from home and murders his staff before Ryu arrives to inform him of the mission's failure to capture Tetsuo. Nezu shoots him and leaves with a briefcase full of money. However, he later dies in an alley from a heart attack. Having followed him, Ryu also dies from his wounds.Kai manages to find Kaneda and Kei at an urban water-filled ditch and explains that he and Yamagata found Tetsuo, who acted strangely and somehow killed Yamagata. Angered by the news of his friend's death, Kaneda vows vengeance. Takashi and Kiyoko then appear, beckoning Kei who walks over the water before disappearing. Kiyoko tells Kaneda and Kai that Tetsuo's powers have become unstable and they are trying to stop him. Kaneda argues that Tetsuo is his friend and that he is responsible for finding a way to defeat and kill him.Tetsuo makes his way towards the stadium, killing soldiers in his path and destroying vehicles and helicopters. Possessed by Kiyoko once again, Kei attempts to fight him but is thrown aside. Tetsuo exhumes Akira's entire cryonic chamber from the ground and opens it but finds nothing aside from dissected body parts housed in individual canisters. Kaneda, armed with an experimental laser cannon, rides into the chaos and confronts Tetsuo. As they fight, Shikishima intervenes with an orbital weapon called SOL, the beam of which severs Tetsuo's right arm. Enraged, Tetsuo flies into space and rips SOL out of orbit, causing it to disintegrate in the atmosphere. He then returns to the stadium where Kaori arrives, finding him screaming in pain due to his intense powers while he synthesizes an artificial, mechanical arm using the remains from Akira. The arm seems to throb with a life of its own. Shikishima finds Tetsuo and explains to him that the espers' mind-controlling drugs administered to Tetsuo were meant to stunt the evolution of his uncontrollable abilities, but they are weakening. He pleads with Tetsuo to return to the hospital but Tetsuo attacks him. Shikishima shoots back and Kaneda appears, intervening.The three espers arrive at the stadium and appear to try and communicate with the remains of Akira in the canisters. Unable to control his powers any longer, Tetsuo's body begins to morph: his arm transforms into a horrific blob that attempts to swallow the Colonel. Kaneda shoots it, causing it to recede but Tetsuo's entire body swells into a protoplasmic mutation, crushing Kaori to death in the process. Kaneda escapes as the espers awaken Akira; now appearing as a young boy without the need for a physical body. His appearance triggers a monstrous explosion and Kiyoko grabs Shikishima, transporting him to safety in the nick of time. Akira creates a blinding ball of energy that engulfs the entire city and begins to absorb Tetsuo who cries out for Kaneda's help. Desperate to save his friend, Kaneda follows Tetsuo into the energy sphere, followed closely by the three espers who are determined to save Kaneda, though they observe that they might not return.Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and Akira's childhood memories, seeing how much Tetsuo trusted Kaneda and witnessing how the three esper children were first studied upon just before Tokyo's destruction. The espers tell Tetsuo that Akira is sending him 'away', but somewhere safe as Kaneda is ejected from the inside of the sphere, just before it explodes. The explosion partially destroys most of Neo-Tokyo, leaving a gaping hole where the sphere was that is quickly flooded by the sea. Doctor Onishi is killed when his laboratory collapses.Kaneda awakens and is reunited with Kei and Kai. Together, they ride away on their damaged bikes to start anew. Colonel Shikishima emerges from the tunnel where he was placed by Kiyoko and watches as the sun rises over the destroyed city.Elsewhere, a cosmic 'bang' breaches the darkness and a voice speaks out, ""I am Tetsuo."" Coming into full control of his powers, he initiates a new universe."

Jack's Back,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095389/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A serial killer in Los Angeles celebrates Jack the Ripper's 100th birthday by committing similar murders and only one has a chance of stopping him. A young doctor is suspected when a series of Jack the Ripper copycat killings is committed. However, when the doctor himself is murdered, his identical twin brother claims to have seen visions of the true killer.—Alexander Lum <aj_lum@bigpond.com> Someone's emulating Jack the Ripper so the entire police force tries to find him. A young doctor who works in an inner city clinic sees that one of the persons who comes to the clinic is an old friend who is now a junkie. It seems she's pregnant and wants an abortion but the head of the clinic refuses to have it done. Later, he goes to see her and he finds another doctor from the clinic doing something to her. He assumes he's the ripper and runs off, but, the man catches him and kills him. The police assume he's the ripper and closes the case. But, as they place the body in the ambulance, another man comes walking by who looks like him. It turns out to be his twin brother. It seems he had a dream about his brother's death. When the psychiatrist consulting the police thinks he's telling the truth, he hypnotizes him and he reveals things that only a person with intimate knowledge could know. So they wonder if he could be the ripper. In the meantime, he tries to figure out what happened to his brother.—rcs0411@yahoo.com A young doctor in Los Angeles named John Wesford becomes a suspect when a series of Jack the Ripper copycat killings is committed. He and another young doctor (Jack Pendler) are at the scene of the final crime in the series; they know each other because they both work for the same medical unit, reporting to the abusive Dr. Sidney Tannerson. Pendler seems to realize that John Wesford's testimony will likely lead to his being arrested as the killer, and in an ambiguously staged scene, murders him, staging the scene to resemble a suicide. The police quickly name John Wesford as the copycat killer and hypothesize that he killed himself out of guilt.To the surprise of everybody involved, John Wesford's identical twin brother, Rick, arrives and claims to know his brother did not kill himself because he has seen visions of the true killer. In flashbacks, the viewer sees that Rick Wesford saw Jack Pendler killing his brother. The police humor Rick briefly, but only because his existence calls into question the eyewitness testimony that had put the identical-looking John at the scene of the crime, and Rick's suspicious knowledge of the crime scene (from his visions) make him an attractive suspect himself. Under scrutiny by the police, Rick allies himself with another of his brother's colleagues, Dr. Chris Moscari, and carries out his own investigation. He successfully identifies, tracks down, and confronts Pendler, who attacks him and is arrested. Pendler is in some regards an excellent suspect - physical evidence puts him at the scene of the final murder. But in other regards he is a terrible one, not matching known characteristics or habits of the killer.Rick continues to dream about his brother's murder and asks the police psychologist to hypnotize him to clarify these visions. In the refined vision he again sees Pendler attack his brother, but also notices that Pendler's shoes do not match those worn by the copycat killer, and that Dr. Tannerson had been at the scene. He intuits that Tannerson will next attack Dr. Moscari and speeds to her house, attracting a string of police cars with his reckless driving. Moscari survives and Rick avenges his brother's death by killing Tannerson, who (it is implied) had manipulated Pendler into murdering the unfortunate twin."

He struggles on the field during practice, but cannot keep up with the other teammates, and is often berated by the strict coach.Meanwhile, Archie Costello, the charismatic head of ""The Vigils"" a gang and secret society, compiles a list of socially ostracized students with the aid of Obie, The Vigils' nerd-like treasurer. These outcasts will be assigned to perform prank assignments as part of their Vigils initiations. Jerry Renault is on Archie's list, as is Roland ""The Goober"" Goubert. The next prank is to be ""The Chocolates,"" and is designed to disrupt the school's annual fund raising chocolate sale. When Archie learns that Jerry Renault's mother recently died from cancer, he declares the young football player requires ""therapy,"" and enlists Jerry in ""The Chocolates"" prank.Meanwhile, taking advantage of the Trinity School headmaster's illness and convalescence, the corrupt Brother Leon hopes to take over the position by gaining attention with a formidable fund raising effort. He purchases outdated Mother's Day candy, and plans to repackage it for the Trinity fundraiser.

However, in time-honored Vigils tradition headed by Bill Carter, the Vigil's president and Archie's superior, Archie must blindly take one marble from among six - five white and one black - in a box. Should he select the black marble, Goober will be freed from his task and Archie will have to perform it. Archie draws a white marble, and Goober is charged with loosening the screws. Archie then declares that the chocolate sale will give the Vigils an opportunity to defy school authority once and for all. That afternoon, Jerry discovers a note from the Vigils in his locker, and later learns that he must refuse to sell candy for the school. Meanwhile, Archie is blackmailing another student, a local punk named Emile Janza, into keeping Jerry in line by threatening to reveal photographs of Emile masturbating.Dismayed at the rebellion against selling candy, Brother Leon threatens student David Caroni with a failing grade if he does not reveal the plot.

As brother Leon beats Jerry in front of the class, the boy fantasizes about his mother's death and about having a love affair with a female recluse named Lisa.Following Jerry's lead, other Vigils members and most of the other students join the chocolate boycott. Since Brother Leon used his own money to buy the outdated chocolate, his personal finances are at stake. In an attempt to restore order, he threatens to close the school if the Vigils continue in their refusal to sell chocolates.

In fact, the fifty boxes have been set aside by Archie and Obie as part of a boxing rally they have planned to take place at the school football field the following night. The contest pits Jerry against Emile, and the $2 tickets permit students to dictate the sorts of brutality they would like to see during the bout, with the fifty boxes of chocolate offered as the prizes for a knockout.

Powwow Highway is a Native American cult classic. ""For the Northern Cheyenne tribe of Lame Deer, Montana, the American Dream has taken a grim detour. Here, Buddy Redbow is a committed activist battling a suspicious land-grab. Philbert Bono is a serene spiritual warrior guided by sacred visions. But when Buddy's estranged sister, Bonny Redbow, is framed and jailed in New Mexico, the two men take Philbert's rust-wrecked '64 Buick 'war pony' on a road trip that makes some very unexpected stops along the way.""
It's a realistic, sometimes surrealistic view of the times for not only the Northern Cheyenne, but for most tribes in America. From third world living conditions to ill treatment by authorities and the general public. Against this background is the story of two Cheyenne men on very different paths, one spiritual, one materialistic, who end up on a road to save one of their own from wrongful imprisonment. Along the way they come to a greater understanding of each other and themselves, to heal old wounds and renew faith in their past as well as their future."

Levi says nothing but a proper Viking funeral: the body was placed in a boat and sent out to sea, and from the shore the family would shoot a flaming arrow at the boat to set it aflame, so it would dissolve into ash in the sea. Then he asks the four boys to join him in peeing into the ocean.Youngest grandchild Cy Blue gets the idea to give the Rocket Gibraltar to grandpa for his birthday, so he can someday use it for his funeral.

Daskal begins a manual turret traverse cranking a handwheel. The tank fires an anti-tank round over the Afghan's heads, Koverchenko gestures and tells them to spread out. The tank starts up and moves away before Koverchenko can get a shot with the RPG. The Russian notices an oil trail and races after the tank. The tank has to follow a winding path in the canyon while the pursuing Afghans can take a straight line shortcut over the hills.

Koverchenko fumbles but gets a shot off, a direct hit on the muzzle of the main gun. The tank continues to the Pass and apparent safety. Taj appeals to Allah and an explosion above sends a rockslide down onto the tank. It is stopped. Sherina and her women look down from above. The tank is disabled as the right tread is broken. Noticing leaking fuel, Koverchenko sends a firebomb that explodes under the tank. Golikov and Kaminski panic and Daskal issues them with grenades, he wants them all to suicide together. Kaminski refuses and the two younger men manage to disarm the Major. The three Russians get out with their hands up surrendering. Golikov gets on his knees disgusting both the Afghans and Daskal. Koverchenko taunts the Maj but uses his nanawatai protection to allow the Russians to leave on foot. At the crossroads Daskal pauses and falls behind the other two, the angry Afghan women approach screaming.At the burning tank Taj gives Koverchenko a souvenir rifle. Sherina arrives all bloody and apologizes to Taj. Another Russian helo arrives and the mujaheddin scatter. Taj calls for Koverchenko to come with them but he puts on the horse collar sling and is lifted up in the air."

At the front door, a man selling vacuum cleaners (Michael Delano) rings the doorbell. Johnson invites the salesman inside and leads him to the cellar. Downstairs, Johnson removes his sunglasses and kills the salesman by looking into his eyes. Afterward, Johnson disposes of the body in the furnace and returns upstairs.Outside, Nadine sees smoke coming from the chimney and goes to the cellar. Before opening the furnace, she hears a car horn and runs upstairs to see her boyfriend, Harry, and Dr. Rochelle arrive. Harry sees Jeremy and recognizes the chauffeur as a local petty criminal. In the study, Dr. Rochelle informs Johnson that his blood is breaking down and evaporating, and offers to continue to look for a cure.In the dining room, Harry tells Nadine he will come back that evening for their date and leaves with the doctor. Jeremy drives Johnson around town, and honks the car horn at a trio of prostitutes. Irritated by the high decibel level, Johnson reminds Jeremy not to make loud noises around him. Seeing the women, he orders Jeremy to invite them to the mansion. After returning, Johnson orders Jeremy to go to bed and leads the women to the cellar, where he removes his glasses, killing them with his light infused eyes, and draining their bodies of blood. Afterward in the study, Johnson transports a case of the prostitutes' blood to Davanna. Later at the station, the police chief reports to his force that another body has been found drained of blood, making a total of eight victims.At the mansion, Johnson opens the door to a woman introducing herself as his ""Birthday Girl,"" (Becky LaBeau) and wearing a sash with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it. Johnson informs her she is at the wrong house, but he hypnotizes her to follow him to his study and transports her to Davanna as a live specimen.The following morning, Nadine sees Jeremy with Johnson's breakfast tray and notices the water in the drinking glass is red. Jeremy confides to her that three prostitutes came to the mansion last night, but never left. Worried, Nadine goes to the clinic to test the red liquid. Harry calls Nadine and asks her out for dinner that evening. After she agrees, Dr. Rochelle tells her he will have the test results that night.At Johnson's mansion, a female alien (Rebecca Perle) wearing sunglasses arrives in the study. Johnson asks about the Earth woman he transported. She informs him that she was crushed to death by the planet's gravity upon arrival. Telling him she needs blood to survive, they break into the clinic.That evening, Dr. Rochelle interrupts Nadine and Harry's date with the test results, revealing it contains a large number of unknown vitamins. Nadine tells Dr. Rochelle she took the substance from Johnson and asks about his condition. However, under Johnson's hypnotic spell, Dr. Rochelle is unable to tell Nadine anything.At the clinic, Johnson hooks up a large bottle of blood to the female alien. However, the blood in the bottle is infected with rabies. Afterward, he tells her to hide at a hotel. Weakened by the tainted blood, she stumbles into four punk rockers in an alleyway. As the punks threaten her, the blood causes her face to breakout with blisters and her mouth to foam. After she attacks the men, she makes her way back to the clinic and passes out in the waiting room. Dr. Rochelle returns and orders nurse Mary Oxford, to carry the woman into his office. When he pronounces her dead, he removes her sunglasses and notices her eyes are hollow. He instructs Mary to call the police.Nadine returns to the mansion and receives a telephone call from Harry. He tells her he is at the clinic, and a woman died there wearing one of Nadine's dresses. Believing Johnson is behind the woman's death, Harry suggests Nadine leave. However, she and Jeremy decide to stay and search the mansion. They find the red vitamin supplement and transportation portal in the study. Nadine orders Jeremy to search the cellar. Downstairs, Jeremy finds human remains in the furnace.Upstairs, Nadine picks up the ringing telephone. On the line, Dr. Rochelle informs her the dead woman's blood had been evaporating, but her death was caused by rabies. He continues that the reason her blood was vanishing was due to living in an environment experiencing extreme nuclear warfare. When Nadine asks if Johnson has the same blood ailment, the doctor is unable to respond due to Johnson's mind control. After hanging up, Johnson appears and attempts to hypnotize Nadine. Jeremy fires a gun at him, but Johnson removes his sunglasses and stares at Jeremy, killing him.Nadine runs away and calls Harry from a telephone booth in a park. Harry sets out on his police motorcycle. Johnson catches up to Nadine and telepathically orders her to return to the mansion and enter the transportation portal, as she will be the new research specimen. After she walks away, Johnson gets into his car and drives away to kill Harry. On Sea Cove Bridge, Harry turns on his motorcycle siren. The high-pitched noise causes Johnson to drive off the bridge. The car explodes, and Johnson is killed. As he dies, Nadine and Dr. Rochelle are released from his mind control.Later at a cemetery, Nadine and Harry stand by Johnson's gravestone, which is inscribed, ""HERE LIES A MAN WHO WAS NOT OF THIS EARTH."" As they leave the grave site, a man wearing a dark suit and sunglasses, walks towards the grave carrying an aluminum briefcase."

But instead of disposing the body properly Robert takes it home without anyone else noticing. The girl is visibly excited about her husband's gift and they go feel up the body real good. The body is so rotten it basically is a very wet and juicy skeleton covered with crap and stuff. As decayed as it may be, it still got a juicy eye in its skull.They saw off a chair's wooden leg and Betty rams it into the body's crotch. It gets her all hot and bothered. She rolls a condom over the chair leg/the body's newly gained huge and super hard erection. Betty drops her black saucy lingerie and sits on the erection. She kisses the corpse - her husband feels her up from behind - her breasts touch the corpse's chest - her tongue goes all over the dead man's face - then the man kisses its face and takes its eye into his mouth.They sit up Mr. Dead and the girl's penetration continues. The eye falls out of Mr. Dead's skull and Betty tries to catch it with her mouth. We get to see this sequence in slow motion so we don't run risk to miss it. Their intercourse almost looks like a dance but all this time Mr. Dead appears to be awfully stiff and apathetic.The next day Robert gets fired from his job for several reasons. He left his unwashed and stinking working clothes in his locker over the weekend and he arrives three minutes too late to work.Meanwhile Betty reads Mr. Dead a story. They are in bed. She's naked. Then Mr. Dead gives her oral pleasure.When Betty learns that Robert lost his job she gets pissed because she knows that now they have a serious corpse-supply problem. So she leaves him for good, but not without taking Mr. Dead with her, which doesn't please Robert at all.He burns a picture of her. Then he strokes his cat. He feeds her with some human bowels, possibly a liver. But the kitty doesn't want to eat, so he puts her into a plastic bag and bashes it against the wall. Blood stains on the wall.The man plays dead in the bathtub. The cat is close to him. She doesn't have to play dead. The kitty's blood runs into the tub and mixes with the water. Water turns red. Man rubs kitty's bowels on his naked body. He takes a bite.We see the moon. A white, shiny ball in a vast of black nothingness. The white, shiny ball turns into a white, shiny, grinning skull.Robert drinks some liquor and takes some pills. He falls asleep and dreams of being a corpse and coming to life in a plastic bag. A girl walks up to him and gives him a gift. It's a crummy, decapitated head. They throw it around and play with it like you would play with a ball. The head turns into a piece of meat. He jumps around in the grass with the piece of meat in his hands and is jolly.As he wakes up from the dream he gets a prostitute and they fornicate on a cemetery. The whore sits on a gravestone. He can't get it up because she is too much alive and moving and such. So he strangles the life out of her. Then the sex works for him real smooth.The next morning: A gravedigger finds him lying next to the body. At this moment Robert wakes up and shovels off the gravedigger's head (he is skull-free from his lower jaw upwards). The digger gargles in pain as his hand tries to find the rest of his skull. The attempt fails and he drops to the floor. He bleeds, twitches, jerks and gargles a lot. Fade-to-black. He probably died soon afterwards.Robert runs around in grass on some hills. He jumps around like crazy and yells in joy. Back home he nails a Jesus miniature onto a crucifix.He takes a knife and rams it into his own belly. He lays on the bed and takes the erect penis out of his pants. As he rams the knife deeper into his torso the spermatozoon shoots out of the penis. One huge white fountain after another. The scene is intercut with the rabbit footage played in reverse. The bunny jerks and quirks back to life. The man pokes around in his bowels like a kid would poke around in a plate of broccoli hoping somebody would finally say that it doesn't have to eat up. The white fountain turns red and shoots even higher. He doesn't survive it.A gravestone with his name written on it. We see a shovel being jabbed into the grave by a person wearing lady's slippers."

It starts with ""Man in the mirror"", A fantastic song urging the crowds to make a change .. followed by other MJ music videos including a Bad parody. In other words its a thrill ride, with beatiful dancing snd singing. Smooth Criminal has a movie like video at the end, where MJ's wishes from a wishing star comes true. The villain and his actions can also act as a metaphor to Michael Jackson's experience with the media. The movie starts with Michael Jackson singing his hit song ""Man in the Mirror."" After that song is over a montage starts of Michael as a kid and works it's way up to present day. After the montage is over, the music video for ""Bad"" is being remade by various child performers with the name ""Badder.""

The director yells at him and the two actors decide to chase him as well. Michael manages to hide in a wardrobe room and sneak out dressed as a bunny, riding away on a bicycle. The paparazzi soon realize what happened and begin to chase Michael again. Michael's bike shifts into a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and the music video for ""Speed Demon"" begins. After Michael is sure he has lost his fans he stops in the desert and take off his bunny suit and sets in on a rock. He starts to walk away when something taps him on the shoulder. The bunny suit has come alive and it seems to challenge Michael to a dance contest. After a little dancing, a police officer taps Michael on the shoulder and gives him a ticket, Michael also noticed that the bunny has vanished.

We see a full moon and three little kids on a rooftop looking at a builiding. Sean (Sean Lennon), Katie (Kellie Parker), and Zeke (Brandon Quintin Adams). Michael steps out of the builiding they are looking at and looks up at the sky. Then we see someone cracking a peanut in his hands, and Michael looks over to them and dodges quickly as henchmen start shooting at him. The two boys in fright, run away, and Katie stays behind frozen. She starts shouting Michael's name and then we go to a flashback.We see Katie, Sean, and Zeke playing in a field with a soccer ball and along with Katie's dog Skipper. Someone kicks the ball and Skipper runs over, picks it up with his mouth and runs into the woods. Michael goes to look for him and Katie comes along with him. They call out to Skipper who is no where to be seen. They soon find a section of the woods covered with nothing but spiderwebs and locate a secret tunnel inside a rock. They both follow it trying to be as quiet as possible. When they see people, they stop on a staircase and look to see what they are talking about. They overhear someone who plans to get every child in the world hooked on drugs. The villan identifies himself as Franky LiDeo (Joe Pesci). Named Mr. Big for short. Katie sees a spider about to crawl on her arm and starts to scream. Mr. Big sees them and sends his gunmen after them.We go back to the building where Michael is trying to dodge the bullets being shot at him. After the gunmen stop shooting, we see that Michael has gotten away and is running for his life. Katie notices this and runs off the building to find her two friends. After a while of running, Michael is cornered in a dead end and Mr. Big and his guards go to kill him when Michael's lucky star goes by. His lucky star can make him do anything or turn into anything. Michael turns himself into a super fast car and speeds past his enemies, escaping.We now see Katie entering an abandoned club, and Sean and Zeke are both hiding there and greet her. They all claim Michael told them to meet him there earlier. They leave the club to make sure they are at the right place, and they run behind a fence when they hear someone coming. Katie looks over and sees Michael transforming back into human form. She is in shock and after she gets better, they all look up and see him entering the club. A burst of white light flashes and Michael enters. It turns out to be a lively, crowded, gangster-infested 1930s American nightclub. Michael is surprised by this, and everyone in there is surprised to see him. Michael feels it is his job to entertain them, and so, he performs his hit song, ""Smooth Criminal"". Despite the fact that the song ""Smooth Criminal"" is four minutes and seventeen seconds, this scene is dragged out to be about ten minutes long. Towards the end of Michael's exciting performance, Katie is kidnapped by Mr. Big while Sean and Zeke are still hiding behind the fence. Michael runs out to find what happened and they all go looking for her.They find Mr. Big's lair and enter trying to be as quiet as possible. Sean and Zeke stop while Michael goes ahead. Then a metal door closes behind him, separating them. Michael runs to the center of the room and the boys go to the roof. A spotlight hits Michael and follows him until he is cornered. Then all the gunmen come out and point their guns at him, and two guards go infront of him. We hear Katie screaming as she is coming up an elevator. Mr. Big has a hold of her and is hitting her several times. Michael tries to go to her but the guards hold him back. Mr. Big reveals that he ""just wants to get everybod high, "" and is about to inject Katie with a drug when she scratches his face and runs to Michael. At the same time, the guard takes the back of his gun, hits Michael once in the stomach and once in the face. Giving him a concussion. Mr. Big catches Katie and pulls her back, turns Michael over and kicks him once in the chest. Michael is on the floor in pain and Katie tries to crawl away but is stoppped, Mr. Big orders the men to kill her first. Michael screams at him to leave her alone when his lucky star flies by and he transforms into a giant robot! Mr. Big manages to escape after Michael has killed all of the guards. Including the guard that was keeping Sean and Zeke on the roof. Michael then turns himself into a space ship and kills Mr. Big when he tries to kill him with a cannon. The kids are confused as to why they were left behind and say goodbye to Michael as he flies away thinking they would never see him again.We then see the kids sitting on a bench in the street saying how much they miss him. Katie gets up to sit in a corner and she says to herself that she wishes he would come back. Just then we see mist and Michael appears out of nowhere. They all see him and run to him in happiness. He tells them to follow him and he leads them to the club, informing them that there is a surprise in store. Once again, a burst of white light flashes when they enter. It is at this point, when the quite rare, very long ""Smooth Criminal"" video ends, and the ""Come Together"" sequence begins. This is where the kids get Skipper back, and Michael performs his closing song ""Come Together."""

It's up to Buff McLarge Huge and the power of yelling to save the... I guess day.—dylan-burke-bowman In the distant future in deep space, the large colony spaceship Southern Sun travels through the galaxy. On board, the evil Kalgan (John Philip Law) and his men take control of the ship through a violent and explosive mutiny. Kalgan's plan is to scrap the ship and sell the passengers into slavery. One man, (Reb Brown) decides to make a stand and encourages others to fight against Kalgan's rebels. Armed with laser cannons and neutron grenades, he leads the Commander's daughter and a handful of soldiers into a blasting battle to re-take the ship.—Larry B. Set sometime in the distant future the intra-galactic space-colony-ship Southern Sun (which bears a strong resemblance to the Battlestar Galactica) is on a multi-generational trip to a new settlement. Tired of his fate to live and die on the ship, Kalgan (John Philip Law), the head of the Enforcers who are tasked with the ship's security, causes an explosion in the Southern Sun's docking bay just as a fighter is landing there. The decorated fighter pilot, Dave Ryder (Reb Brown) survives the crash via an emergency teleportation system, but his passenger, Professor Spooner is killed in the the crash, which causes serious damage that puts the docking bay out of commission. Ryder is taken to see the Southern Sun's commander, Alex Jansen (Cameron Mitchell), who accepts Ryder's account of events, though his daughter Lea (Cisse Cameron) flies into a rage at Ryder and accuses him of abandoning the Professor to die. Despite this less than harmonious introduction, the two quickly become friends, and it becomes clear that Lea is strongly attracted to Ryder.Just before the docking bay accident, a group of witchcraft-practising female aliens named Bellerians are brought on-board. While they never interact with the main characters during the course of the film (aside from a brief scene in which their leader Jennera consults with Commander Jansen), it is implied that they influence the actions of the lead protagonists, and also covertly help them by seducing Enforcers, which causes Kalgan to execute them for their seeming incompetence, thinning out his own forces.Meanwhile, Kalgan meets with his main co-conspirator MacPhearson (James Ryan), the ship's chief engineer who feels unappreciated for his part in an incident in which he prevented a major disaster, but was severely injured and left unable to walk without aid. MacPhearson informs Kalgan that it will be several weeks before any ship can land or take off from the Southern Sun, which will give Kalgan and his forces time to take over the Southern Sun and force her to land; to that end Kalgan has also enlisted the aid of space pirates from the nearby Corona Borealis system. MacPhearson then consults with his engineering crew, and all bar one of them agree to join the mutiny. The sole dissenting engineer, Parsons, accuses them of treason and threatens to report them to Commander Jansen, which results in the other engineers quickly turning on and killing Parsons.Shortly thereafter, a maintenance engineer named Codell discovers evidence that Kalgan caused the explosion in the docking bay, and after informing a bridge officer, Lt. Lamont of this, begins making his journey to the bridge to inform Jansen. Kalgan intercepts him on the way however, and offers him a choice - join the mutiny, or be put in the ""deep freeze."" Codell instead chooses to commit suicide.That night, Lea is flirting with Ryder in the ship's disco, when a pair of Enforcers arrive and ask for Lamont, who is also at the disco. She leaves the disco and is immediately shot dead by Kalgan, who leaves the scene in an electric kart. Ryder and Lea both overhear the whole thing and chase Kalgan down in another kart, eventually arriving at the ""deep freeze."" This turns out to be a room in which troublesome officers are stored in cryogenic suspension; when Kalgan takes over the Southern Sun they will be thawed out and given one further chance to join Kalgan's forces, or be ejected into space. Kalgan and more Enforcers then arrive, and Ryder and Lea are heavily outnumbered and forced to flee, but now have solid evidence that there is a conspiracy and that Kalgan is the ringleader.Ryder is thusly promoted to being the ship's new security chief, just before the Southern Sun encounters the space pirates. Thanks to Ryder's leadership, the Southern Sun easily defeats the pirate ships (which look uncannily like Cylon Basestars) without taking any serious damage. Knowing that he cannot now rely on outside help, Kalgan abducts Lea and threatens to kill her if Commander Jansen does not voluntarily give up control of the Southern Sun. Not wanting to rely on Jansen giving into his demands though, Kalgan begins torturing Lea for information by using a laser-like device on her teeth. During this MacPhearson arrives and gives Kalgan a progress report, causing Lea to realise that he too is a part of the conspiracy.Acting on his own authority, Ryder goes into the bowels of the Southern Sun and knocks out an Enforcer, taking his uniform. Lea, meanwhile, has been left under the supervision of a single security guard who she pretends to seduce, then she knocks him out and steals his uniform just as Ryder arrives. After a few more encounters with Enforcers, Ryder and Lea escape and return to the bridge. An infuriated Kalgan realises that with his main bargaining chip lost and the command crew now aware that MacPhearson is involved in the conspiracy, he has no option but to take control of the ship by force.The mutiny begins in full, with both sides taking heavy losses - in particular, many officers fall to their deaths over the various railings dotted throughout the ship. Eventually Ryder sets off an explosion that traps most of the mutineers in that section of the Southern Sun, but both Kalgan and MacPhearson escape. MacPhearson isn't able to get very far and resorts to hiding in a gas expulsion sump. Ryder (implied to be under the influence of the Bellerians) fills the sump with methane gas which he then ignites, causing a fire which burns MacPhearson to death.With Kalgan the only mutineer still at large, Ryder and Lea pursue him into the ship's bowels in an electric kart. Lea gets knocked out of Ryder's kart, which she then accidentally disables by shooting it in an effort to take out Kalgan, who in turn rams Lea with his own kart, causing her a slight injury. After getting his kart working again, Ryder aims it at Kalgan's kart and drives toward it at full speed, diving out of it at the last second. Kalgan is unable to dodge it, and is apparently consumed in a massive explosion.The mutiny seemingly thwarted, Ryder and Lea apparently make preparations to get married. Later however, it turns out that Kalgan survived the explosion, ending the film on a cliffhanger."

Nerdy social misfit Wanda Saknussemm is devastated when her boyfriend dumps her because she lacks a sense of adventure. Then she has been informed that her father, an archaeologist, has disappeared on an expedition in North Africa. She goes in search of her missing father and, before long, finds herself in a bizarre underground world where crazy subterranean creatures think she is a secret agent and want her dead. Thwarting them at every turn, Wanda discovers an inner strength she never knew she had before her arrival. But once the denizens of the underground have their way, she will never find her father - or see the light of day in sunny Malibu - again.

After being dumped by her boyfriend for not having a sense of adventure, Wanda is informed by a letter that her father, an archaeologist, fell into a bottomless pit and perished. She flies to North Africa and while going through her father's belongings, she finds his notes about Atlantis, apparently an alien spaceship that crashed millennia ago and sank into the center of the Earth. Wanda comes across a chamber beneath her father's apartment and sets off a chain of events by chance that ultimately cause her to fall into a deep hole.An unharmed Wanda wakes up deep within the Earth to find Guten 'Gus' Edway (William R. Moses), a miner whom she protects from being slain by two people. Gus agrees to help Wanda find her father, whom she believes is alive and trapped underground. Wanda soon discovers that both she and her father are believed to be secret agents planning an invasion of Atlantis. During her adventures, Wanda's appearance changes from nerdy to attractive (by removing her glasses and using a steam vent to clean her skin). People from the surface world are believe to be aliens by the Atlanteans, who appear to be virtually identical to surface dwellers, and when Wanda is overheard speaking about Malibu Beach by a lowlife informant, she soon becomes a hunted woman and must dodge attempts at capture, both by the mysterious Government House and from thugs paid by the crime lord Mambino (Deep Roy).Wanda's attempts at escape are assisted by Charmin (Thom Mathews), a handsome rogue who (briefly) assists her flight and falls in love with Wanda. She is ultimately captured by the evil General Pykov (Janie Du Plessis), who wants to execute both Wanda and her incarcerated father. The Atlantean leader decides to free Wanda and her father, provided they remain quiet about Atlantis. Gus shows up and helps the duo escape while fighting off General Pykov and her soldiers. Wanda and her father board a spaceship that takes them back to the surface and the film ends with Wanda on the beach, wearing a bikini and a sarong.

It is very similar to our world, only the hidden absurdity of everyday life here has become apparent. An engineer in charge of the production line of a factory in Moscow is sent to a small town to try to specify the distributor the new dimensions of a mechanic part they need. But in this town everybody seems to be crazy (a secretary who works naked, a group of people take the engineer as a rock & roll player, etc) and, in addition, this man is witness of a suicide, so he is trapped inside the town.—Michel Rudoy <mdrc@hp9000a1.uam.mx> Part Kafka, part Agatha Christie and part Monty Python, director Karen Shakhnazarov's surreal satire of Communism follows an Everyman engineer named Varakin (Leonid Filatov) who arrives in a remote city where nothing quite makes sense, but everyone acts as if it does. He's quickly drawn into the investigation of the suicide (or possibly murder?) of a local restaurant chef, Nikolaev - who may (or may not) be Varakin's missing father. The more complex and absurdist the mystery becomes, the more poignant and plaintive Varakin's predicament - ""I have to get back to Moscow,"" he pleads to no avail. Along the way we're treated to a bizarre and wonderful sideshow of non sequiturs out of a Wes Anderson film, including an underground museum filled with a thousand years of real and imagined Russian history (""Here's the pistol with which Urusov shot the False Dimitry II."")

Jason decides to get into the shuttle-suit and try to enter the ship, even though Chuck Koreman (Robert Kurcz) at ground control had chosen Ray. There are hieroglyphics on the outside walls of the ship. There is a hole on the outer layer of the ship, and Jason picks up a container.

The dwarf kingdom, Shuflandia, exists in a cellar of a library, and only the most obedient get the chance to grow to king size and inhabit the larger world. Once there, nobody wants to return to Shuflandia. Also, there are no women in Shuflandia.—Polish Cinema Database <http://info.fuw.edu.pl/Filmy/> Journalist Olgierd Jedlina seems to be obsessed with the themes somehow connected to the dwarfs and not the little people, but dwarfs as in fairy tales. There is a reason to that - he is a dwarf himself and he used to live in one of the drawers in place known as Drawersland (Szuflandia). But now he is in what dwarfs call King Size, which means that he is no different from people. The dwarfs can live among the people completely unnoticed as long as they will drink Polo-Cocta, otherwise they would shrink back to their small form. Olgierd is one of the dwarfs that were lucky enough to gain access to Polo-Cocta, but the ruthless leader of Drawersland wants to keep all the dwarfs in the small form threating any of the Polo-Cocta drinking dwarfs as traitors. But Olgierd is forced to return to Drawersland when his friend is arrested. What sounds like completely insane story for children is in fact one of the best sci fi comedies, although you have to understand the background of the production. King Size was created in times when Poland was still a communist country and the citizens were usually unable to leave Poland on their own free will. Juliusz Machulski, author of few great comedies, managed to parody the whole communist system by turning the story into fairy-tale like production, where actors are working with giant props.

JK wants that After the robbery Mathur declares that the 25 Lakhs he had illegally loaned JK are also declared as stolen loot.
Inspector Anand Shrivastav (Kader Khan) gets wind of this plot. He arrests a key henchman of J.K., and is about to crack the case when J.K. enlists an exotic dancer, Julie (Aruna Irani), to use the robbery evidence against JK & Mathur as a backdrop and frame the honest inspector for corruption. Inspector Shrivastav is arrested and is imprisoned for three months. Inspector Shrivastav, the honest and innocent inspector, is so depressed about the false charges that he hangs himself at home after being released on bail. now with Anand gone, JK tries to eliminate Julie, who escapes.This creates a lasting and powerful impression on his young eight-year-old son, Vijaykumar (Amitabh Bachchan), simply known as 'Vijay', who firmly believes in his father's hard work, innocence, and dedication, for years. Every day, he thinks about his father's uncalled for decision. Vijay retains the noose his father used to hang himself. He would someday restore his father's honor. Vijay and his mother leave their house and live in the house of another police inspector named Aslam Khan, who would take care of them as Vijay grows up.As Vijay grows, his determination to avenge his father grows too. 20 years later, a young Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) in the inspector uniform, grows up in the care of Inspector Aslam Khan (Pran), Inspector Shrivastav's friend and partner, who has allowed Vijay and his mother to live with him, and Vijay becomes a cop himself. Vijay is friends with Shaheena, the daughter of Aslam Khan. Aslam Khan is an honest cop much like Vijay's father. Vijay is an obsequious and cowardly inspector, prone to bribery and generally scared of powerful criminals. It doesn't take JK long to find Vijay, get him on payroll, and run his underworld crime empire (drugs, guns, racketeering) past the cops.
A new apparition bursts upon this scene who calls himself ""Shahenshah"", a costumed crime fighter (see movie poster). He has a left iron hand which is used to attack enemies and smash objects, and Shahenshah's other weapon is a noose. Oddly enough, it is the same noose Vijay's father used to hang himself with. This is because it is revealed a bit later that Shahenshah is actually Vijay. When wearing Shahenshah's attire, Vijay describes himself as ""one who doesn't hold a cop's job but does the same work; one who apprehends criminals himself, conducts the trials himself, and, pronounces and executes the sentences himself"". A bit later, the mysterious Shahenshah reveals to the public that he is none other. Frustrated and helpless at the corruption in the police force, Vijay has employed this new tack to get to the criminals. Vijay/Shahenshah's outward mission is to take out crime, but his real goal is to get to the guys who framed his father.Vjay catches the eye of small-time trickster Shalu (Meenakshi Seshadri) who lives there with her aging and ailing mother Julie. Vijay gives money to Shalu for the treatment of her ailing mother & Shalu falls in love with him.

He also halts the demolition of a slum (JK had bought the slum to develop a housing project and had bribed Vijay to stay put on the night of the demolition.

Vijay manages to save his secret identity from Shalu.Shalu decides to infiltrate J.K.'s coterie by becoming an exotic dancer. One night, she attempts to kill J.K. by shooting him but is shocked when J.K. reveals he had been wearing a bullet-proof vest the whole time. Vijay is in the room (to collect his bribe) when the shooting happens. When JK is about to kill Shalu, Vijay lies to J.K. that Shahenshah's weakness is not letting Shalu die. He also lies that if J.K. returns Shalu to Shahenshah, Shahenshah will return J. K.'s goods worth millions. But J.K. is ultimately fooled. Shahenshah later detonates a bomb planted in J.K.'s truck.Julie later reveals that she was on Inspector Shrivastav's side all along and was pretending to be on J.K.'s side the whole time; her supposedly helping J.K. frame Inspector Shrivastav was all just a part of her plan to help the police arrest J.KThe fun begins when J.K. murders an honest crime reporter Mohammed Salim (Vijayendra Ghatge), who was about to expose JK's crime ring. Salim was married to Shaheena (Supriya Pathak), the daughter of Aslam Khan, and was also Vijay's brother-in-law. Simultaneously Aslam Khan also discovers that Vijay has been accepting bribes from JK and unceremoniously kicks him out of the house. Vijay vows to resurrect his image.Vijay now decides to turn around his image as a cowardly cop. He openly defies J.K. Julie agrees to testify against J.K. Shalu provides ancillary evidence. And J.K. prepares for an all out war against Shahenshah/Vijay, Shalu and the lot of his enemies. At Salim's funeral, only one of the many witnesses of his death were present. He was about to reveal J.K.'s name, but a sharpshooter named Rana Pratap Singh shot him to death. But Vijay manages to catch the shooter who reveals that the assassination was ordered by JK.Vijay arrests JK, but the entire Govt machinery comes down to save him. Vijay is asked to present evidence on JK's involvement in Salim's murder. That when Julie steps forward with the knife that JK used to kill Salim (which he had thrown away casually, & was picked up by Julie). She also reveals JK's role in implicating Vijay's father, all those years ago.There is a veritable bloodbath on the streets as Inspector Vijay tries to get Julie into the courthouse. But the lawyers manage to refute Julie's testimony and JK is set free by the court.And there is a final showdown where Shahenshah reveals his secret identity and becomes the nemesis for all the culprits. To give himself a chance to escape, J.K. abducts Shalu. The showdown leads Vijay, dressed in Shahenshah's attire, chasing J.K. to the roof of the courthouse where J.K. is pleading his case, because his cover is blown. J.K. falls through a hole in the roof and is clinging on for dear life, with the whole court, the judge, audience and all look on in astonishment. Vijay throws the noose down to J.K., and he gratefully accepts it. J.K., being the ruthless man that he is, attempts to attack Vijay. Vijay lets go of the noose, which slips around J.K.'s neck, and before the whole court, J.K. Verma is hanged, avenging Inspector Shrivastav and Salim the reporter, Shaheena's husband.

Emerald City,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101808/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A couple is being tested by the temptations of a big city. A couple move to Sydney from Melbourne, and soon become lured by the bright lights of the big city. Colin, the scriptwriter husband, is corrupted by his editor and then falls for the girlfriend of his writing partner, while Colin's wife Kate begins to lose sight of her ideals in a new world of hustlers and cynics. A comedy of life's temptations - lust, greed and power. The city in question is Sydney and the colour green signifies greed and envy in David Williamsons amusing satire on its film and publishing industries. The story centers around the Rogers family, loosely modelled on Williamson's own. They have recently moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Colin (John Hargreaves) is Australia's most successful screenwriter (like Williamson), but currently down on his luck. He doesn't want to make what he perceives as a ""movie of the week"" about Tony Sanzari an amusement park hijacking that is offered to him by his agent, Elaine Ross (Ruth Cracknell), but a story about the coastwatchers of World War II, because his uncle was one, and it was Australia's great contribution to the war. His wife, Kate (Robyn Nevin), is a book editor and wants to publish a novel by Aboriginal writer Kath Mitchell (Michelle Torres) titled Black Rage, but her publisher, Ian Wall (Nicholas Hammond), says ""Blacks don't sell books."" They have three children, Penny (Ella Scott), who has been frequenting a disco called Downmarket, Hannah, whose teachers say she is depressed, and Sam (Haydon Samuels), whom Colin fears Kate is encouraging to be gay.
Colin teams with a womanizing hack writer named Mike McCord (Chris Haywood) to work on Coastwatchers, who hates the idea, but wants his name on the film as co-writer because it's an instant status boost in the industry, even though he is primarily just typing dictation. When he hears of Kate's problem, he prank calls Ian Wall, accuses him of racism, and threatens that a group of militants will mob the publishing house if he doesn't publish Black Rage.
Coastwatchers proves a ratings disaster, so Mike latches onto Colin for another project, a rip-off of Miami Vice set in Australia and loaded with Australianisms. Malcolm Bennett (Dennis Miller), who usually finances Colin's productions, advises him to get back with Elaine because his project is ""shit"". ""So is Miami Vice,"" Colin responds. ""That's classy shit;"" Malcolm tells him, ""this is absolute shit."" The difference is that the writers of Miami Vice are writing at the best of their abilities, while the fact that Colin is writing below his level is painfully obvious. During this time, Colin becomes attracted to Mike's girlfriend, Helen Davey (Nicole Kidman), but ultimately draws the line in the friendship and avoids cheating on his wife.
Ultimately, Kath Mitchell is nominated for the Booker Prize, and Kate accompanies her and Ian Wall to the awards ceremony, though she does not win. Although Kate tells Colin that Ian looks like a ""garden gnome"" she admits that she was unfaithful. A disillusioned Colin returns to Elaine Ross and accepts the project she offered him. Elaine calls Sydney ""The Emerald city of Oz. Everyone comes here along their yellow brick roads looking for the answers to their problems and all they find are the demons within themselves.""..."

When rare mineral that can produce incredible amounts of energy is discovered on a mostly uninhabited planet called New Texas, settlers and frontiersmen as well as outlaws arrive from all over space to find fortune. However, what they don't know is that a monstrous demonic spirit called Stampede, who looks like a bull, also lives there. Stampede puts feared outlaw Tex Hex under his control and starts collecting various dangerous outlaws for its supernatural army of minions that will take over the planet. Scared citizens send for help, so a highly capable Native American marshal called BraveStarr and a feisty, pretty and always fair female judge J. B. McBride arrive to investigate the attacks. BraveStarr soon finds allies - a wild alien sentient semi-anthropomorphic warhorse called Thirty-Thirty, who carries a powerful shotgun, a funny member of an alien mole-people race, who are master diggers and builders as well as the original natives of the planet, and a mysterious powerful Native American shaman, who is the only one who knows about Stampede, and who gives BraveStarr the power of the eyes of the Hawk, which enhances his vision, the ears of the Wolf, which gives him super-human hearing, the strength of the Bear, which gives him super-human strength and the speed of the Puma, which gives BraveStarr super-human speed. Even with all this powers and sidekicks, though, taking down Stampede could prove to be impossible. The story is set in a distant future, where humanity has apparently colonized various planets. The film opens with a conflict between the good Shaman of a space-faring Native-American tribe and a demon-like entity called Stampede. As revealed in flashback, the previous battle between them had destroyed a planet and had isolated them from their former allies. Moments before the battle, Shaman decides to send his only companion, the young boy Bravestarr, to the Marshal organization for training.Stampede causes the Shaman's spaceship to crash-land in the desert planet of New Texas, in an attempt to kill him. The Shaman uses much of his power to survive the event, and he somehow prematurely ages in the process. He emerges from the crash-site as a weakened old man. Stampede realizes that he will need a servant to continue his campaign.On another area of New Texas, the mining partners Tex Hex and Angus McBride have had a falling out. Tex Hex incapacitates Angus and plans to leave the planet with their spaceship. It is loaded with a valuable mineral resource, Kerium, which will make Tex wealthy. Angus warns him that the ship is overloaded and can not escape the planet's gravity, but Tex refuses to listen. Shortly after, the overloaded spaceship crashes in the desert and Tex is seemingly killed.Stampede resurrects Tex Hex, and performs a ritual which grants Tex magical powers of his own. The process leaves Tex with a withered appearance, while his hair and mustache turn white. Tex is now powerful, but looks much older than his actual age. Meanwhile, Angus has been crippled (permanently losing the ability to walk), but manages to contact a space-faring rescue ship to take him off the planet. Its crew discover the Kerium and start spreading the news.The film covers events of the following decades through brief scenes. Like a gold-rush, the search for Kerium causes miners, merchants, and outlaws to flock to New Texas. As a town emerges in the desert, Tex Hex progressively recruits the most skilled of the outlaws into his gang. Some of them he convinces to join by promises of great wealth, others he defeats in combat and then intimidates into joining him.New Texas has had no law or legal system, but it eventually requests for interplanetary marshals and judges to be send. The authorities from the other civilized world only send them one marshal (BraveStarr) and one judge (J.B. McBride, Angus' daughter). BraveStarr is quite charmed with the young, red-headed J.B. J.B. is intrigued when she discovers that BraveStarr has superhuman powers, but he explains that he can't control his powers or when they appear.BraveStarr and Tex Hex introduce themselves to each other, shortly after the marshal's arrival. BraveStarr gets the upper hand in their initial skirmish, but then Tex outsmarts him and captures him. BraveStarr is soon stranded in the desert, while J.B. impulsively enters the desert to search for him.BraveStarr is rescued by the Shaman, who helps him to regain lost memories of his childhood. The Shaman used a ritual which allows BraveStarr to gain control and awareness over his powers. Meanwhile, J.B. gets lost in the desert and befriends the planet's only native tribe, the Prairie People. They grant to her a combat suit and weapons created by their ancestors.Following the return from the desert, BraveStarr uses his new powers to defeat Tex in unarmed combat. Tex feels that his gang lacks the numbers to overcome BraveStarr and his allies. Tex sends recruitment offers to every outlaw and villain on the planet, and soon has a large army at hand. Stampede does not appreciate Tex's initiative and uses intimidation to remind Tex that he is still the demon's servant, and not a general. Stampede, however, promises to help Tex in the upcoming battle.BraveStarr and his allies rebuild the town in order to make it able to endure a siege. BraveStarr decides to recruit the Prairie People to help rebuild the town, despite the disdain which most of the town people feel for them. The racist mayor voices objections, but BraveStarr and J.B. intimidate him to back down.As J.B. prepares herself to take part in the coming battle, she admits that she keeps thinking whether she will survive to see ""another sunrise"". BraveStarr admits to her that he is afraid too, but that it is natural to feel that way when facing death. They exchange their first kisses shortly after.During the actual battle, BraveStarr and his allies outclass Tex's army of outlaws, and even manage to capture a few of their enemies. But then Tex summons Stampede, who overcomes the town's defenses. Stampede uses necromancy to raise skeletons of giant beasts from the desert, and has them attack the town. Stampede then defeats the Shaman in combat. But BraveStarr uses the Shaman's magic spear to deliver a seemingly mortal wound to Stampede. The demon vanishes and Tex Hex is sucked into a portal.With the town actually surviving the battle, BraveStarr leaves it to spend time with the Shaman.

Forbidden Sun,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097375/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a rape at a girl's gymnastics school, questions arise and bring to light ancient Cretan rituals. A couple of Texans manage a school in Crete, to train girls in Olympic gymnastics and learn some Ancient Greek History. Charles and Francine Lake are helped by an English teacher, a local gym coach and a janitor, all three single, and apparently sexually repressed. The twelve young women try to escape the rigorous discipline of the school, to mingle with the locals on the mainland where there is rock music by a visiting band. When one of the girls is sexually assaulted, the janitor Ulysses, a peeping tom, is suspected - and four girls vow revenge, in the form of a Cretan ritual named the Bulldance. The revenge goes wrong, and it is found that Ulysses was not the culprit. More people were hiding secrets in the small island. One of the girls, dejected in love, goes on to further violence - including on herself, going alone in an arena with a bull 1400+ lbs.—Artemis-9 Paula is the last girl to arrive in Crete, and another girl welcomes her at the pier, while Ulysses, a janitor, carries her luggage. The girls board a small boat that links the mainland to a small island (actually Lokrum, near Dubrovnik), - seen in a brief aerial shot - totally occupied by a thick wood and the The American School in Crete, a girls-only school for American girls to train in Olympic gymnastics and Ancient Greek history, for summer courses.
The school principals, Professor Charles.D. Lake and his wife Francine Lake - a former Olympic athlete. Paula is upset when the janitor grabs her too much, she thinks, when he helps her out of the ship, while the young man, who barely speaks English, doesn't seem to know what she is complaining about. Paula meets the principals: Charles seems to be the manager, but uncomfortable in the girls presence, leaving the first interview to his wife.The twelve girls do gymnastics in an improvised gym, in the basement of a poorly maintained ancient palace, coached by Jack, a young man. Jane does a double somersault with pirouette, and lands on her toes in perfect equilibrium, arms raised high back to a huge icon of the Great Goddess of Minos. Later, at the dormitory, Paula asks her companions who that statue is, and they give her funny explanations about it. In their first class, Francine teaches the girls about the Great Goddess, who had come from Syria to dominate the earlier Greek civilization.Next day, there's a visit to the ruins of the royal palace of Crete (actually, the ruins of houses of ancient Salona, near modern Split). In front of the wall reproduction of the Bulldance, Florence explains how the Bull dance was performed by a girl and two boys, «the bull charging at 15 miles/hour» and «the gymnast [girl] grabs the horns, goes over it, hands square on its back, continues on, does a somersault here, and lands on the ground». It was a gamble with death, in honor of the goddess. Of all the girls, Jane is listening most attentively.The school being so isolate, the only evening entertainment is on the mainland, where a rock group is playing. Jane gets the attention of a young man, and they go for a bit of flirtation on the beach. He catches a snake by hand, and Jane - who was first horrified at the sight of it - ends by biting it's head off, following the man's instruction.Back at the dormitory. Jane suggests to her roommate they could prepare a surprise show of the Bulldance, for Jack. Then, they notice that two men are outside in a fishing boat, ogling at the lighted windows of the dorm rooms.
Jane, revealing her wild side - that had her ejected from a couple of schools before - runs up to the top of the old wall, and faces the sea in her flimsy white night shirt, bare breasts, holding a piece of rope in each hand to simulate snakes - evoking the image of the Great Goddess she had seen. This makes the men to stay longer, and that gives time for Francine to come out and shout at them angrily. One of the men was Ulysses, who pretends they were fishing, but they started off immediately back to the mainland.Next day, when the two principals are visiting the town (actually the monumental stairs to the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius, in Dubrovnik), police lieutenant Ioannides complains to them that he has been told that one of their students had been seen showing her breasts at night to some fishermen.
Charles Lake is embarrassed and tells him that the girl in question had been punished already. Francine interrupts her husband's apology, and menace with a complaint to the American consulate if she ever caught again the local men ""fishing"" in the night with binoculars. The haughty officer walks away, and has some words with Ulysses.Three girls escape in the night, swimming to the coast in their bikinis, just to join the rock music band, again. But Jane's idea is in progress: one girl meets with a boy, who has produced a bull's head to wear during the surprise the girls are preparing.In their bedroom, Francine complains of a headache, and her husband complains they have not made love for a long time. He wants to return to Texas, she likes it in Crete, and that they are booked for months to come and can't close the school now.Meanwhile, Jane is trying on the bull's head in her room. Then she hurries in silence to Jack's detached house Jack doesn't open the door, because he was having sex with Francine, who escapes through a back door. Francine shows herself to Jane, feigning to come from the main house, and asks her ""Are you sleep-walking?"" Jane takes this leading question as a way out to explain her own presence there, and feigns to be sleep-walking...Next morning, during a cross-country exercise, Paula disappears, assaulted by someone. Her colleagues start searching for her, while apparently a hooded man is trying to rape her, and then - as girls are coming closer and calling out for Paula - he escapes in a rowing boat.The lieutenant has a confrontational interview with Francine, over listened by a couple of girls. He suggests the girl could have been making things easy for the attacker, by wearing few clothes - which enrages Francine.
Jane and two colleagues want to act, rather than wait for the non caring policeman. Jane is sure the culprit is Ulysses, but her companions are unsure, and Jane promises to punish him herself. ""I've a plan, a great plan,"" she tells them. Eventually her two colleagues go along with her.Elaine and Steph invite Ulysses to the island, telling him they need ""a strong man they can trust"", to make a surprise to coach Jack, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Betsie is having doubts about Jane's plan - but she, too, ends up accepting it. Steph and Elaine escort Ulysses to the basement gym, where Betsie is exercising on the asymmetric bars.
At last, they tell him what they want: to play the Bulldance, with him playing the part of the bull wearing the heavy mask that had been fabricated by the other boy. He plays along - and then discovers he is unable to take the mask off, as the girls have locked the harness in his back with a padlock.They hit and kick him at will, and then Jane, who's wearing a blood red leotard, prepares to kill the ""bull"" with an old foil, in a toreador's poise. The intervention of one of her colleagues prevents the death stroke - and she performs the somersault over Ulysses' back. ""I did it, I did it!""
She is so happy, they all are distracted, and Ulysses grabs the foil and attempts an attack with it. Steph knocks-him out with a club.Betsey tries - in vain - to make a phone call to Rory and Andy, two boys they had seen on the mainland, because there is only one phone, and all the other girls are queuing to call home in the USA, due to the time zones difference.
She decides to swim across to the mainland, while her colleagues have hidden the knocked-out Ulysses under some plinths.The police has come to the island to check on Ulysses, given the facts that he disappeared, and Francine had complained before of his harassment. An alarm sounds. Miss Stonehouse, a teacher, takes a long time checking if all twelve girls are present.
Since the gym has been closed from the inside, it takes some time to Charles to find another key, and open it for the police search.Paula is under sedation, and still in shock.
The three girls manage to bring Ulysses to the shore, and Betsey is back with Rory and Andy. The two boys take Ulysses in the boat to the mainland.
This time on the way back to the mansion, the girls catch Francine going to Jack's place in a hurry. While the other three continue to the mansion, Jane follows Francine, and spies on her
and Jack having sex. Jane is mad with jealousy, because she loves Jack, and had tried to attract his attention a couple of times, and had been rejected.Next day, there's a feast in town, and kids are putting on a show that involves a wooden bull. While the principals and most girls are at the feast, Jane sends a message to Jack, for him to visit her at the gym. She convinces him to put on the bull mask, and locks him inside it. He tries to grab at her in vain - and she calls out for help.
When Miss Stonehouse and a few girls arrive, she claims Jack attacked her... which they believe without noticing that he couldn't have locked himself in the mask by himself. Jack manages to run away from the basement, but Jane runs after him.
Meanwhile, at the kids' feast, a girl ""kills"" the ""bull"" with a wooden sword, about the time Jane clubbers Jack off a cliff into the sea.Paula is back in the mansion, but lays in her bed under sedation, attended by a nurse. The girls repent for their action. Jane disappeared. Francine mourns for Jack.By Paula's bedside, professor Charles whispers his confession, saying he doesn't know how he could have done what he did to her.Three girls find Jane in a fit of rage and self-destruction, having spread kerosene on the floor, and closed herself in her room about to light a match. The arrival of a couple of roommates prevent her to conclude her immolation by fire.Paula wakes up from her sedation, sees Charles close to her - and she screams out loud. The nurse comes running in, but he manages to hide, and then escape without her seeing him.The house is in alarm again, for Jane's disappearance, and the lieutenant Ioannides is back. He takes a phone call and learns that Jane has been seen on the mainland, near a big bull. In no time, he takes the principals with him to the mainland.Jane is wearing her skimpy white gym dress, walks around the huge bull, listening to applause and incentive from an nonexistent audience. Jack (with his left arm in a bandage) limps forward into the arena. Francine is about to throw herself forward, but Charles grabs her back, and walks forward, using his vest like a toreador's cape. The bull charges in, and gores him.Francine runs to her husband, horrified. Jane is calm and poised, her back to the large wood announcing the TRADITIONAL NATIONAL FESTIVAL OF CRETE. Eye-to-eye with the bull, she shouts, ""Watch me, Mrs. Lake. Watch me doing the bull dance!""Then she runs forward, in her gamble with death that is named the Bulldance."

'68,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094587/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"'68 covers exactly one year (January 1st through December 31st) in the lives of Zoltan Szabo and his family, Hungarian immigrants, working hard to make a life in San Francisco in 1968. The Szabos tries to adjust to the new country, changing times and each other. The year covered was one of particular cultural change in the US and this interplays with the cultural changes occurring around Zoltan, his wife and his two college-age sons.—Joseph.Tappe@yahoo.com In 1956, Zoltan Szabo (Sándor Técsy) escaped the Soviet invasion of Budapest. In 1968, Zoltan now runs a Hungarian restaurant in San Francisco. Now a father, Zoltan is a mighty figure of a man with a booming voice, trying to make a success of his struggling Hungarian restaurant. On December 31, 1967, Zoltan's son Peter (Eric Larson) argues with his younger brother Sandy (Robert Locke) about his tardiness from returning with maintenance supplies.
Later that night the family, including Zoltan's wife Zsuzsa (Anna Dukász) host a New Years celebration enlivened by Hungarian folk music. Tibor (Shony Alex Braun) and Piroska Kardos (Donna Pecora) and their daughter Vera (Terra Vandergaw) are in attendance as well as the flamboyant Gizi Horvath (Elizabeth De Charay) who flirts with Sandy. Vera, however, is Sandy's girlfriend. Shortly after midnight, Zoltan introduces his family to the restaurant patrons gathered there. Then Peter leaves to do a news story for his Berkeley newspaper with Vera and Sandy giving him a ride and thus escaping their responsibilities at the restaurant. Peter exits the VW van to attend a Peace and Freedom rally lead by Maoist Alana Chan (Miran Kwun). Vera and Sandy are parking when Vera declares the absolute freedom of being eighteen and envisioning their limitless future. Sandy and Vera clumsily make out. Peter is largely ignored at his party until two party crashers Rusty (Maureen McVerry) and Isadora (Anya Lem) wander in. They invite Peter to a different party but take off with two guys on motorcycles. Back at the restaurant, Zoltan is strategizing to hire a waitress to get more American customers into his restaurant. The immigrant crowd drinks and jokes about the Soviets. Gizi breaks out in song.
Peter sees Alana on campus and gets just enough information to write a story on the Peace and Freedom Party that it is praised by his editor. Peter, however, also has a political science paper due for his class. Zoltan hires a very attractive Italian girl named Beatrice (Nike Doukas) as his first waitress. Alana sees Peter in the street and offers to further educate the white boy. Alana decries the U.S. role in Vietnam as a racist war and says it is more important to feed people than offer them a bill of rights. They dine together in a Chinese restaurant. Peter's professor (Lee Carrau) summons him about his political science paper which he says lacks critical analysis and is merely a collection of slogans. Then the professor tells Peter that he has discovered the paper plagiarized and he will likely be suspended from college.
Peter gets a job at a motorcycle shop called Westy's Wheels. Sandy takes a birthday cake to Gizi's home. Gizi, a former nightclub singer in Hungary, sings a song and shares a chocolate with Sandy, mouth to mouth.
One night, Zoltan is trying to entertain Millard the restaurant critic with mixed results. Vera pulls Sandy off the job when she is upset that Sandy has not called. Sandy steals her away to his van where he declares his love for Vera so they can make love. Peter arrives and his upset father assigns him to Sandy's duties. Later, Zoltan dreams of a restaurant chain and tells of his lack of choices during the depression. Peter sees that as an advantage because the future was already designed for him. After Peter leaves Bela Csontos (Rusdi Lane) pitches an investment in ""bunk parking"" to solve San Francisco's parking shortage.
Peter enjoys riding motorcycles. He finds Sandy stuffing restaurant ads under windshield wipers and gives him a ride. They wind up near a golf course where they interrupt play to get to the shoreline. They smoke pot and Peter confesses he sells motorcycles because he was suspended from school. Peter encourages Sandy to stay and help their father with the restaurant.
Zoltan learns that Peter has been suspended and is quite upset. Peter downplays the situation and tells his father he has no interest in attending law school. Sandy is late for work again and Zoltan orders Peter to help his mother inside. Sandy appears hand in hand with Vera and they announce their engagement. Zoltan is furious believing both his sons are throwing their lives away. Zsuzsa is more understanding. When Beatrice consoles Zoltan, he kisses her.
Westy (Neil Young) scolds Peter for having political news on the radio where Eugene McCarthy nearly defeated Lyndon Johnson in the New Hampshire primary. West admits being a fan of Joe McCarthy. At an engagement party for Vera and Sandy, Hungarian dancers perform. Business has improved since the restaurant went full on Hungarian. Gizi believes Vera and Sandy are too young to marry and know nothing of love. Zoltan makes a midnight date with Beatrice. They dance and Beatrice encourages Zoltan to leave his wife so they can make a new start together.
Peter is working one night when bikers break into his shop, punch Peter to the ground and steal motorcycles. When Bobby Kennedy announces his run for president, Peter works on the local campaign where he again meets up with Alana. She is confused by Peter's changing priorities. Vera who is being ignored by Sandy, visits Peter at the bike shop the day LBJ announces he will not seek a second term as president. Westy is irritated when the political news is on TV and orders Peter to take down his Kennedy poster. Peter pays Westy what he owes on the motorcycle and quits his job. Gizi has an affair with Bela who is building his parking ramp in front of her house. Zoltan leaves the restaurant to be with Beatrice but Zoltan is hesitant to leave Zsuzsa because of the challenges in life they have come through together. Peter finds Sandy in a gay bar. Sandy begs Peter to talk to Vera for him. Peter explains to Vera how she is better off with her freedom at her age encouraging her to follow her dream to become a designer.
At a hippie rock concert, the bikers who Peter reported to the police for stealing bikes from Westy's shop find Peter. The gang leader (Sandy Bull) persuades Peter to ride along with their gang. Peter impresses them with his ability to ride despite the punches and pushes he is absorbing. When they return to the concert, the gang leader convinces Peter to call the cops to tell them he was mistaken or die. Isadora wants Peter to ride off with her behind him. They ride to an isolated place on the coast and make out and have sex on the bike.
Peter is with Alana canvassing for Kennedy in a black neighborhood when Martin Luther King, Jr. is assassinated. Reacting in fury, the blacks attack, pull a knife on and beat Peter and steal his motorcycle. Zoltan explains to Beatrice that he most values being in charge of his own business and Beatrice sees no place for herself. Their conversation is interrupted by Zsuzsa who is familiar with Zoltan's infidelity. Alana is encouraging dock workers not to load ammunition and has a confrontational with a trucker. Peter fails to sell his most recent story to the newspaper because it is too political. He decides to take Alana to meet his family. Beatrice leaves Zoltan and the restaurant to pursue her own dream. Peter learns from his mother that Peter has been drafted. Sandy, Bela and Zoltan are drinking shots before the boy goes off to war, a situation which Zoltan supports. Peter encourages Sandy to find a way to avoid serving in the military which upsets his father.
Later, Peter and Alana are watching footage of the many civil uprising and protests across the globe. Peter tries to kiss Alana but Alana stops him saying radicals only get involved when their hearts are in it. Alana and Peter go to a Chinese theater performance. Alana explains that in old China a woman's primary duty were to the wishes of her parents.
Peter continues to work on Bobby Kennedy's campaign until he is shot. Peter regresses into a state of despair and disillusionment until Sandy finds him walking along the docks. Sandy delivers the news that their father is very sick. The family gathers at Zoltan's bedside. Zoltan complains about his struggling restaurant. He also says even though he has lived in America for many years, he still feels like a foreigner and does not wish to be buried there.
Peter returns to working at the restaurant and is greeted by family and friends. Zoltan recovers enough to keep the books at the restaurant. The nature of the restaurant has changed again and resembles an American coffee shop serving hamburgers and sandwiches. Zoltan releases Tibor Kardos, the gypsy violinist from his payroll.
Bela christens his bunk parking prototype, but it collapses under the weight of a car. In the aftermath at the restaurant, Gizi chastises Bela for drinking and feeling sorry for himself. This is more than Gizi's husband Dezsö Horváth (Jan Nemec) can take and he leaves Gizi to find her own way home. Peter turns on the television which is reporting on the Russian invasion of Prague. This is followed by a news report of protesters confronted by police outside of Democratic headquarters in Chicago. Peter argues with his father that they are both freedom fighters, while Zoltan sees the protesters as disrespectful radicals.
Peter and Sandy kick around a soccer ball. Peter seems satisfied running the restaurant but Sandy reveals he will soon be going for his army physical and enlisting. Peter visits Vera in her new job as a singer in a honky-tonk bar. She is happy with her life.
Sandy goes to his physical and realizes he does not belong enlisting. After passing his physical Sandy declares himself a homosexual and kisses the officer at the desk on the lips. Back at the restaurant, Sandy is drinking and celebrating his not going to war. Zoltan questions him and Sandy uses the opportunity to declare to his family he is gay. Zoltan finds it disgusting, and sends his son out disowning him, Peter tires to defend Sandy and appeals to Zoltan's big Hungarian heart. Peter is put out as well.
Peter and Alana are participating in a protest against the Vietnam War. They shout ""no more war!"" with dozens of others. Sandy visits Vera at the country western club. Vera announces that she is dating the steel guitar player, a guy Sandy also finds attractive. Tibori is now a member of the band and slips on some Hungarian music as the credits roll. 7*"

When Gordon is taking his girlfriend's picture in Hong Kong, several Caucasian thugs led by a Chinese man, Kogan, threaten her, so he beats them up. Elsewhere, Bernard Wong pays his workers extra money to continue digging his land after discovering human bones. The thugs are members of the Black Ninja Clan, whose dead are buried on Wong's site. One of their operatives strangles Gordon's girlfriend, believing she knows where Gordon has hidden the Golden Ninja statue that apparently gives him power and won't say, while another hires Ghost Ninja, a beautiful witch dressed in white to kill Wong, his daughter Fanny, her husband George, and her son, Bobo, for three million dollars. Fanny is frightened by a cat in the house upon move-in, and the Black Ninja leader keeps swinging her sword to hallucinate frogs jumping to their deaths out of her refrigerator and her soup ladle turning into a flying snake (strung on a wire that is highly visible without pausing despite being a split-second shot). The witch keeps spooking Fanny and Bobo, who insists on riding his bike in the living room, but George doesn't believe either of them. Gordon (sitting in front of a poster of a strangled woman marked ""this could happen to you"" and another poster of a swimsuit model) responds to their complaints (in shot-reverse shot, as they're obviously not in the same film) and commands Magic Chan, a wizard with a magic mirror he has forgotten, and his obese sidekick, Firecracker, in the same manor, and frequently keeps in touch on the phone after his Caucasian operative living next door, Sara, is murdered by a zombie man. Sometimes he uses a black phone, but more often it is a Garfield phone (which the camera moves and music suggest is supposed to be funny). The Ghost Ninja is more interested in her own desires than killing the family, and masturbates to the couple's lovemaking before spiriting herself into Fanny's vagina (there is no full-frontal nudity) in order to lure George away from her, though she makes him physically ill, as she did to Bobo by stuffing his mouth full of handfuls of grass. The Ghost Ninja, once compelled by the Black Ninja leader, calls upon more women like dressed her, plus one impersonating Bobo's grandmother as a lure for him, and the zombie man, in an all-out assault against the family, while the two bumbling idiots (Firecracker and Magic Chan) are having a drinking contest, and Gordon, in a red ninja suit, who has been offing the Caucasian ninjas, prepares to confront Kogan, the Black Ninja leader.—Scott Andrew Hutchins <scottandrewhutchins@yahoo.com>"

Pohjanmaa,1988,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095880/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the novel of the same name by Finnish author Antti Tuuri, this delicious late-'80s comedy builds its dark humour on the stereotypical mentality of the northern part of Finland. While perhaps not as entertaining to a person unfamiliar with Finnish traditions, the brilliant acting and directing, plus the warm, beautiful Finnish summer more than make up for the cultural gap. The story begins with a group of brothers and their families coming to honour the memory of their recently-deceased father. Spending time together, opening old wounds and creating new ones--it all boils down to brotherhood. No matter what happens, brothers take care of their own. Considering that the events of the movie all take place within a 24-hour period, nothing feels rushed. The film rolls on naturally. The best part about this film is the cast that they managed to put together for the movie. Esko Salminen, Taneli Mäkelä, Vesa Vierikko, and Esko Nikkari are all well-known, extremely-talented Finnish actors, but this movie contains among the best performances of their careers. Especially Mäkelä and Nikkari are brilliant; Mäkelä's quiet and contemplative character has depth that you can just feel--and Nikkari's convincing portrayal of a town drunk. Funny, dramatic, entertaining and definitely a movie that makes you FEEL."

Coached by a very unorthodox trainer, played by Hu Gua, the team eventually meets the international athletes in a wild series of battles and competitions until one side is victorious. With lots of very juvenile humor, crotch jokes, and mildly interesting kung fu action.—AAAndrew"
