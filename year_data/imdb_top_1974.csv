Blazing Saddles,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In order to ruin a western town, a corrupt politician appoints a black Sheriff, who promptly becomes his most formidable adversary. A town where everyone seems to be named Johnson is in the way of the railroad. In order to grab their land, Hedley Lemar, a politically connected nasty person, sends in his henchmen to make the town unlivable. After the sheriff is killed, the town demands a new sheriff from the Governor. Hedley convinces him to send the town its first sheriff.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Greedy land developer, Hedley Lamarr greases palms of an insane governor to induce his help to snatch land to build Hedley's railroad. A key piece of land, Rock Ridge, is inhabited by a flock of Johnsons, all deeply entrenched in the town. The governor tries to help Hedley rid himself of the townspeople; first, he appoints sheriff Bart for Rock Ridge. Next, Hedley sics Lili von Shtupp on Bart. With the help of his sidekick, The Waco Kid, Bart fights for his new town. But the politicos fight back.—LA-Lawyer Rock Ridge, 1874. Determined to run a new railroad through the dusty American frontier town, conniving land speculator Hedley Lamarr has the nerve to uproot its peaceful inhabitants. With law and order being the last thing the ruthless land-grabber wants, Lamarr convinces debauched Governor William J. Le Petomane to do something dangerously unprecedented. As a result, hoping for disorder and a hasty exodus, they appoint an unsuspecting nobody named Bart as the community's first sheriff. But there's no such thing as a foolproof plan. And when Sheriff Bart signs up the Waco Kid, a washed-up gunslinger with an obscure past, as his deputy and right-hand man, change is afoot. Now, for the first time in a long while, the townspeople can make a stand. However, can they foil Hedley's ludicrous money-making scheme?—Nick Riganas In the American Old West of 1874, construction on a new railroad led by Lyle (Burton Gilliam) runs into quicksand. The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through Rock Ridge, a frontier town where everyone has the last name of ""Johnson"" (including a ""Howard Johnson"", a ""Dr. Samuel Johnson"", a ""Van Johnson"" and an ""Olson N. Johnson""). The conniving State Attorney General Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart (Slim Pickens), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane (Mel Brooks) appoint a new sheriff. The Attorney General persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to select Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged. (Bart had hit Taggart in the head with a shovel after Taggart ignored him and his black friend sinking in quicksand, deciding to save their handcar instead.) Lamarr believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or lynch the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town.With his quick wits and the assistance of drunken gunslinger Jim (Gene Wilder), also known as ""The Waco Kid"" (""I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille""), Bart works to overcome the townsfolk's hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo (Alex Karras), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp (Madeline Kahn) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs (which Lamarr characterized as ideally consisting of ""rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswagglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers, shit kickers and Methodists"").Bart now has 24 hours to come up with a ""brilliant plan to save our town"". He gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, 3 miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to complete their task. The sun rises on a fake town that's a perfect replica, down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse. Bart realizes the town has no people in it, so it won't fool Lamarr's villains. Bart orders the townspeople to make ""exact replicas of themselves,"" and leaves with Jim and Mongo to execute a plan that will slow the villains ""to a crawl"". The three construct a tollbooth labeled ""Le Petomane Thruway"", requiring Taggart's crew to pay 10¢ each to pass on their horses. (""Now what will that asshole think of next?"" snaps Taggart.) Since no one in the raiding party has any change, Taggart sends someone back to town to ""get a shitload of dimes"".Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work. Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching villains skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the fourth wall.... literally. The fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre (Dom DeLuise), then into the studio commissary, where a pie fight ensues. Taggart is knocked out when Mongo smashes his head on a cash register, and the fight finally pours out into the surrounding streets (specifically, Olive Avenue in Burbank). The citizens of Rock Ridge chase the villains back to town to destroy them, but Lamarr takes a taxi..... ""off this picture."" He arrives at Grauman's Chinese Theatre to watch the ""premiere"" of Blazing Saddles. Unfortunately, he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre. Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into the theater to watch the end of the film.The film ends with Bart leaving Rock Ridge, much to the sadness, of the townspeople and the railroad workers, for his work there is done. He intends to fight injustice in other parts of the world, which the townspeople and the railroad workers dismiss as ""bullshit"", and Bart admits it's simply getting dull around there. As he rides off, he finds Jim (who still has the popcorn that he bought at the theater), and the two decide to go off to ""nowhere special."" They then hand in their horses to the film crew horse wranglers, and ride off (in a limousine) into the sunset."
The Towering Inferno,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072308/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"At the opening party of a colossal, but poorly constructed, office building, a massive fire breaks out that threatens to destroy the tower and everyone in it. Doug Roberts, architect, returns from a long vacation to find work nearly completed on his skyscraper. He goes to the party that night concerned he's found that his wiring specifications have not been followed and that the building continues to develop short circuits. When the fire begins, Michael O'Halloran is the chief on duty as a series of daring rescues punctuate the terror of a building too tall to have a fire successfully fought from the ground.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> The premiere party for the world's tallest skyscraper catches fire due to poor wiring. A determined fire chief and an honorable architect fight the fire from the outside and the inside respectively. Meanwhile, the fire engulfs floor by floor of the skyscraper, while the owner of the building struggles to find safety for the trapped party.—MonkeyKingMA ""The Towering Inferno,"" one in a string of disaster movies of the 1970s, was promoted as a tribute to firefighters and their heroic work. It was also among the highest-grossing box office draws of the mid-1970s. The finishing touches have just been made to the Glass Tower, a 138-story skyscraper in the heart of San Francisco. A huge celebratory gala, complete with VIP guests, has been planned to celebrate the dedication of what has been promoted as the world's tallest building. But the building's architect, Doug Roberts, suspects all is not right with the building. The contractors have used shoddy wiring, not the heavy-duty wiring he had specified. The overworked wiring develops short circuits, coincidentally enough during the height of the celebratory extravaganza; it isn't long before the Glass Tower becomes a huge towering inferno. The nearly 300 guests become trapped on the building's 135th floor, where the party takes place. Fire Chief Michael O'Halloran immediately devises a daring plan to rescue the trapped guests, but his efforts quickly become a battle against time and the panicked guests.—Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com> Duncan Enterprises, an architectural and construction empire, is readying the dedication of The Glass Tower, the world's tallest skyscraper, located in San Francisco. Amid the activities of James Duncan and his chief architect Doug Roberts, a circuit breaker blows in the building's main utility room - and unknown to all the surge blows another breaker that lights materials in a storage closet on fire. The electrical snafu forces Roberts to cut short a planned vacation with his fiancee Susan Franklin and to confront Roger Simmons, the firm's chief electrical specialist who oversaw installation of the wiring. As the dedication party proceeds on schedule, Roberts finds the building's wiring is in worse shape than he could have expected, and it all blows up when the burning storage closet suddenly erupts into the corridors. The fire spreads with such speed that the entire San Francisco fire department must be called in, led by Battalion Chief Michael O'Halloran, who expresses to Roberts his distaste for skyscrapers because the department can't easily combat a fire above the seventh floor. The two men still must work together, as 300 guests are trapped in the spacious Promenade room at the building's summit - and the fire continues to spread and set off gas explosions, to the point that the only chance to extinguish the fire may well kill the trapped partiers atop the Tower.—Michael Daly In the opening scene, Doug Roberts (Paul Newman) travels by helicopter to San Francisco where he is chief architect for Duncan Enterprises, an architectural firm specializing in skyscrapers. Their greatest project, the Glass Tower, is 1,800 feet high and with 137-floors. It is set for dedication in San Francisco, and a lavish ceremony is scheduled to include Mayor Robert Ramsey (Jack Collins) and Senator Gary Parker (Robert Vaughn). Jim Duncan (William Holden), the company's president, is wooing Senator Parker because his support for an urban renewal effort will allow the company to build more such skyscrapers. When Roberts flies back to San Francisco for the party, he finds in his office his fiancee, magazine editor Susan Franklin (Faye Dunaway), and when the two renew romantic acquaintances, she reveals that she has received a long-sought promotion - which throws a wrench into their plans to move to the countryside to have a family.Doug, however, is interrupted when he gets a call from the Tower utility room in the building's massive basement. In routine checking of the building's generators, a power surge blows out a circuit breaker - and unknown to everyone the surge blows out another circuit breaker, this one on the 81st floor in a large storage closet that sends a wire flopping onto shop rags that catch fire.Roberts consults his pal, Will Giddings (Norman Burton), and the two confront Jim Duncan about the wiring; Duncan's chief electrical engineer is his own son-in-law, Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain), and to all three men's chagrin Simmons cannot be reached by phone. While Will Giddings works with the building's chief security officer, Harry Jernigan (O.J. Simpson), on the electrical systems, Doug Roberts tracks down Roger Simmons and his wife Patty (Susan Blakely), and confronts Simmons about the wiring. Simmons, a thoroughly oily man, insists the wiring is up to city safety codes, but those codes are not sufficient for an 1,800-foot skyscraper. Simmons nonetheless blows off Doug, which agitates Patty as she doesn't want her father's business to suffer because of him.The dedication ceremony goes off as scheduled and the entire building is lit up for the party in the Promenade Room some 135 floors up. Doug and Will miss the party as they examine more wiring, and find it to be in worse shape than they could have imagined. Roberts gruffly orders the main utility room to shut off the power overload (in the process overruling Jim Duncan), then he and Will head to the 81st floor to check relay systems - just as security cameras detect smoke from that floor's storage closet and Harry Jernigan has the fire department called. He proceeds to 81, but before he arrives Doug, Will, and other executives spot the smoke and the fire erupts into the hallway, engulfing Will Giddings. Doug and the others smother Giddings in drapes while one man grabs a fire hose and begins spraying the flaming storage closet. Jernigan arrives and orders Doug to call an ambulance and also to call Jim Duncan and evacuate the Promenade Room while he helps get Giddings to the ground floor. But when Doug calls Duncan, Duncan insists the fire won't spread, and insists that Doug attend the ceremony.The fire department now arrives in force with Battalion Chief Mike O'Halloran (Steve McQueen), who has a distaste for architects because they insist on building skyscrapers even though the department can't easily fight a fire above seven floors. Despite this antagonism, Roberts and O'Halloran work together as the department sets up a forward command two floors below the fire. O'Halloran quietly goes to the Promenade Room and confronts Jim Duncan to evacuate the area, and Duncan reluctantly proceeds. But a gas line ruptures and explodes, detonating more fires around the building and reaching the main elevator banks - and catching a crowd of partiers taking the elevator down only for the elevator to stop on the fire floor and the blaze to engulf them.While evacuating the party guests into the elevators, Senator Parker suggests to Duncan that it will take a great deal of time to evacuate using this method, and suggests ""those with stout hearts and trim waistlines"" use the stairs. They try the first exit, but immediately find smoke when they open the door. They then try the other door, but it appears stuck. They enlist the aid of Carlos, the head bartender, but the three men are unable to find a way to open the fire door.One of the partiers, painter Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones), being entertained by shady businessman Harlee Claiborne (Fred Astaire), doesn't evacuate the building; she instead rushes to the 87th floor where a deaf woman, Mrs. Allbright, lives with her two children, who are students of hers. When security cameras spot Mueller, Harry Jernigan and Doug rush to the 87th floor to rescue the Allbrights. Jernigan rescues Mrs. Allbright, but the fire cuts off her two children and Lisolette Mueller, and when a gas line explodes on the stairway, Doug, Mueller, and the Allbright children must trek up 47 floors to the Promenade Room, in the process surviving a gas explosion that shatters the stairway. They eventually arrive on the 135th floor but now must find a way through a fire door sealed shut by construction cement left over from the week.When word of the sealed door reaches the fire department, two firefighters laboriously trek up to the 135th floor and succeed in blowing open the door, but the stairway below has been destroyed, and with the power failing, the best hope to evacuate the Promenade Room now is helicopter landing on the rooftop helipad - which disintegrates when several panicking partiers rush to the chopper and it has to swerve out of the way and promptly crashes. Now the only hope is to set up a breeches buoy from a building a block away. Doug, however, activates a gravity brake on the outside elevator, so twelve people - the women who were to be carried out on the helicopter, plus the Allbright children, Lisolette Mueller, and one of the two firemen - can at least get to the ground. This, however, goes wrong when more explosions tear the elevator off its track and throws Lisolette Mueller into a fatal fall, forcing O'Halloran to lead a laborious effort with a helicopter to wrench the elevator from its track and place it on the ground with the survivors.After hours of work, the fire reaches critical mass, and O'Halloran is given the grim truth - the only hope left is to explode the building's water tanks on the roof,as they hold one million gallons of water and blowing the tanks is the last hope of extinguishing the fire. This option, however, may kill the remaining partiers trapped on the Tower. O'Halloran explains the plan to Roberts, and while Roberts is explaining it to the remaining trapped guests, the fire makes itself visible.Simmons leads a pack of followers in a takeover of the breeches buoy. He gets in, and Senator Parker attempts to drag him out and restore order so the appropriate people can go. The weight of Parker, Simmons, and several other men carry the breeches buoy out of the window. Simmons pushes Senator Parker and several other men hanging on the breeches buoy to their deaths 135 floors down. Simmons' victory is short-lived, as the rope to the breeches buoy parts, and Simmons falls to his death as well.O'Halloran is helicoptered to the roof. Once there he and Roberts set to work planting explosive charges, then secure themselves with the remaining partiers in the Promenade Room for the fateful vigil before the explosion and ensuing flood. The fire is put out, with the cost of some who aren't securely tied down.Harlee is informed that Lisolette didn't make it, and in grieving disbelief he impotently yells out her name; Jernigan finds him and gives him her cat, Elke, whom he holds, tearing up both in grief and in shame at himself. Patty is also grief-stricken by the death of Simmons. Reunited with Susan, Doug feels the Tower should be left shut down as a ""shrine to all the bullshit in the world"". He also accepts O'Halloran's bitter comment about architects and the need for them to consult the fire department on how to build skyscrapers."

Young Frankenstein,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072431/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American grandson of the infamous scientist, struggling to prove that his grandfather was not as insane as people believe, is invited to Transylvania, where he discovers the process that reanimates a dead body. As a respected researcher and physician, Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, the grandson of the more famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who did experiments on bringing back the dead, tries to disassociate himself from his more famous relative, even to the point of pronouncing their surname differently. Regardless, Frederick is drawn back to the small Transylvannian town and castle where Victor conducted his experiments, he leaving behind his somewhat standoffish and ""untouchable"" fiancée, Elizabeth, back in the US. He also slowly begins to get drawn into the research that his grandfather conducted, he eventually learns not by accident. As Frederick tries to reanimate his dead subject with the help of his hunchbacked aide Igor and his beautiful assistant Inga, rumors abound in the town of what he is doing, they who have been trying to disassociate themselves from the work of the former Dr. Frankenstein generations ago. Inspector Kemp is tasked with stopping any work if it is indeed happening. All these issues collide as Frederick and team try to hide their work from the Inspector while hitting some technical roadblocks, and as Elizabeth comes to Transylvannia and accidentally gets caught up in the experiment.—Huggo Lecturing brain surgeon Dr Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fron-kon-shteen) has lived in the shadow of his grandfather and infamous mad scientist Dr Victor Frankenstein for too long. But family is forever. And after inheriting the ancestral castle in Transylvania, Frederick is about to discover that legends never die. When Dr Frederick stumbles upon his ancestor's secret lab, a miracle happens: the deceased visionary's journals inspire him to continue where his grandpa left off. As loyal servant Igor and pretty laboratory assistant Inga help him reanimate the dead, Dr Frederick is on the brink of making history. All that's missing is a mighty bolt of lightning.—Nick Riganas When the will of Victor Frankenstein, the famous scientist who attempted to reanimate dead bodies, is opened, his grandson, Frederick, who's become a skilled neurosurgeon and teacher and has cut most ties with his family name due to his grandfather's experiments, is given the castle where all the experiments were made. Upon his arrival, Frederick finds and reads through his grandfather's book about his theories and experiments and discovers that they might in fact work. Assisted by Igor, the grandson of the Igor who assisted Victor Frankenstein, and Inga, an attractive lab assistant, he successfully reanimates a body which soon escapes and creates havoc...—J. Rieper Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is a lecturing physician at an American medical school and engaged to the tightly wound socialite Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn). He becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather Victor Frankenstein, the infamous mad scientist; to dissociate himself from his forebear, Frederick insists that his surname is pronounced: ""fraunk-en-stein"". When a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family's estate in Transylvania after the death of his great-grandfather, the Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein, Frederick travels to Europe to inspect the property. At the Transylvania train station, he is met by a hunchbacked, bug-eyed servant named Igor (Marty Feldman), and a lovely young personal assistant named Inga (Teri Garr).Upon arrival at the estate, Frederick meets the forbidding housekeeper Frau Blücher (Cloris Leachman), whose name makes the horses of the nearby stables nay and tremble (a running joke used throughout the film). Upon discovering the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory and reading his private journals, Frederick is so captivated that he decides to resume his grandfather's experiments in re-animating the dead. He and Igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal, and Frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse. Matters go awry when Igor is sent to steal the brain of a deceased revered historian, Hans Delbrück; startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbrück's brain. Taking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled ""Do Not Use This Brain! Abnormal"", which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.Soon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is eventually brought to life by electrical charges during a lightning storm. The creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, he attacks Frederick and must be sedated. Meanwhile, the townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work, unaware of the creature's existence; most concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a one-eyed police official with a prosthetic arm and a thick German accent. Kemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster. Upon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers Blücher setting the creature free. After she reveals the monster's love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.While roaming the countryside, the monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman). Frederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, ""My name is Frankenstein!"". Frederick offers the sight of ""The Creature"" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests. The demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number ""Puttin' On the Ritz"". However, the routine ends disastrously when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police. Back in the laboratory, Inga attempts to comfort Frederick and the two wind-up sleeping together on the suspended reanimation table.The monster escapes when Frederick's fiancee Elizabeth arrives unexpectedly for a visit, taking Elizabeth captive as he flees. Elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstücker or Schwanzstück). The townspeople hunt for the monster. Desperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him. Just as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to speak for the first time and reason with and placate the mob.Elizabeth marries the now erudite and sophisticated monster with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from the Bride of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure the monster's Schwanzstücker."
Earthquake,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071455/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Various interconnected people struggle to survive when an earthquake of unimaginable magnitude hits Los Angeles, California. Construction engineer Stuart Graff is estranged from his jealously possessive wife, Remy, and has an affair with Denise Marshall, the widow of a co-worker. Meanwhile, Remy tries to persuade her father and Stuart's employer, Sam Royce, to use his influence to stop Stuart from seeing Denise. Rogue policeman Lew Slade is suspended from the L.A.P.D. for having punched an obtuse officer from another jurisdiction. Embittered, Slade contemplates quitting the police force. Jody, a perverted grocery store manager, lusts after Rosa Amici, sister of Sal, the assistant to Miles Quade, an aspiring daredevil motorcyclist. The lives of all these people are devastated when a major earthquake rips through Los Angeles and reduces the city to ruins.—Kevin McCorry <mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca> The film opens on Stewart Graff (Charleton Heston) jogging underneath the Hollywood sign. Back home, as he finishes his workout on a resistance machine, his shrewd wife Remy Royce-Graff (Ava Gardner) starts her morning by picking a fight with him. At the peak of their argument, Stewart says to Remy, ""You'd hardly call this a marriage wouldn't you?"" After he's showered and preparing to leave, Stewart finds Remy unconscious with a bottle of pills nearby. Accustomed to her periodic suicide attempts, Stewart prepares to induce vomiting when a violent tremor shakes the bedroom. Remy bolts out of bed, revealing that she was faking.At the Mulholland Dam, two workers begin a routine inspection of the structure in response to the tremor. One of them is drowned in an elevator shaft which has filled with water after the quake.In downtown Los Angeles, Sgt. Lou Slade (George Kennedy) and his partner Emilio Chavez (Pedro Armendáriz, Jr.) are in pursuit of a suspect. They chase him out of their jurisdiction, finally crashing into the hedges at Zsa Zsa Gabor's house. After a Beverly Hills Sheriff yells at Lou for ruining Gabor's hedges, the angry Lou punches him out. When reprimanded, Lou explains to his supervisor that the suspect had stolen the car, gotten stoned, and then driven over a 6-year old Mexican girl without stopping. To his disgust, he receives a temporary suspension from his unfeeling superior.On his way to work, Stewart visits Denise Marshall (Geneviève Bujold), an actress who is the widow of one of his friends and co-workers. He drops off an autographed football for her son and helps Denise run her lines for a scene she is shooting later that day.A junior staffer, Walter Russell (Kip Niven), at the California Seismological Institute has calculated that Los Angeles will suffer a major earthquake in the next day or two. He frantically tries to reach his superior, Dr. Frank Adams (Bob Cunningham), who is busy placing seismic sensors in the field. Another tremor hits as Adams and his assistant are working in a deep trench and they are buried alive. The scientists at the center argue about whether or not to go public with their prediction of a major quake. The acting supervisor, Dr. Willis Stockle (Barry Sullivan), insists that if they are wrong their funding will be jeopardized. He also argues that the panic such a warning would cause could be worse than the earthquake itself. They agree on a compromise to alert the National Guard and police so that they can at least mobilize to help deal with the fallout.While checking out at a grocery store, a poor young woman named Rosa Amici (Victoria Principal) realizes she does not have enough money to pay for all her items. Jody Joad (Marjoe Gortner), the seemingly kind store manager, insists that she keep the items and make up the deficit the next time she shops. Later, when he hears that the National Guard reserves are being called up on the radio, Jody leaves the store in the middle of his shift, revealing himself to be part of the reserve army. He goes to his run-down boarding house and changes into his NCO uniform, enduring the abuse and harassment of his bullying housemates who accuse him of being homosexual because he's got pictures of bodybuilders on his wall.Blowing off steam at a bar, Lou orders a double bourbon and ignores all the illegal activity he sees. A drunk (Walter Matthau) periodically wakes up to toast random people like 'Bobby Riggs'. Daredevil motorcyclist Miles Quade (Richard Roundtree) arrives with his partner Sal Amici (Gabriel Dell) and his sister Rosa. A pool shark collects $50 that Miles owes him, leaving him short for the propane tank he needs to do a stunt for a talent scout. Miles convinces Lou to loan him the money by having Rosa reveal a tight-fitting t-shirt he's marketing with his name on it.The tremor cancelled Denise's shoot; so, she heads to Stewart's office, pretending to meet with a friend. When she runs into him, he is headed out for a drink. They go back to Denise's house for the drink and end up making love. He promises to come back later that night and invites her to spend the summer with him in Oregon, where he will be overseeing a project. Back at the office, his boss Sam Royce offers to hand over the company presidency to Stewart. He asks for some time to consider the idea. Stewart calls Denise and breaks off their plans for later that night. He goes to Sam's office to accept his offer but is stunned to see Remy there. He assumes she has convinced her father, Sam (Lorne Greene), to offer the promotion to Stewart in order to save their marriage. He storms out and she follows him, accusing him of cheating with Denise. He explains that he never had until that day. When they get outside the building, the main earthquake begins, rupturing the San Andreas Fault, and causing thousands of buildings to collapse and causing hundreds of thousands of people to die while shaking Southern California for nearly six to nine minutes. The earthquake is measured 9.9 on the richter scale at the Seismological Institute.When the earthquake subsides, Sam and most of his employees are trapped on the upper floors of their skyscraper, as the elevators have crashed to the ground. They descend most of the way by the stairs, but the earthquake has sheared off a portion of the building, leaving an impasse of about two stories. Sam rigs a fire hose to a chair and lowers his staff down one at a time. When everyone is safe, he suffers a heart attack, and Stewart climbs up to lower him down in the chair.Meanwhile, Denise's son was caught on a bridge over a freeway causeway when the quake struck. She spies him unconscious on the concrete and climbs down to save him. Unable to climb back out with her son, she hails Miles and Sal who are passing by in their truck. After saving Denise and her son, they drive in search of help, coming across Lou who is organizing rescue efforts in the street. Lou commandeers their truck to use it as an ambulance.After nibbling on a donut in a ruined diner, Rosa has been arrested by the National Guard for looting. Jody, now a sergeant, picks her out of a group of prisoners. Recognizing him from the grocery store, Rosa assumes he is going to let her go, but he claims that the streets are too unsafe for her to go anywhere and he orders her to stay inside a secluded store. Another group of troops arrive with Jody's housemates as prisoners. Jody executes them in an act of revenge for all the long time bullying he endured from them, terrifying Rosa and his subordinates as they now see his dark psychopathic side.Once Stewart gets everyone from his office safely to a shopping center named Wilson Plaza, which has been converted into a triage center, he goes off in search of Denise and her son. He ends up driving Lou around in search of survivors and they come across Jody and his regiment. Jody threatens to fire on them if they come any closer and Rosa emerges when she sees Lou, begging for his help. Lou and Stewart pretend to comply with Jody by driving off while Sgt. Joad's scared men look for an officer to have him face a court martial and detainment. But Lou sneaks back and gets the jump on Jody, who's enraged at Rosa for betraying and rejecting him and tries to rape her. Lou shoots Jody dead in self-defense when Jody tries to kill him with his rifle and rescues Rosa.As they drive away, they hear that another aftershock has threatened Wilson Plaza. After a quick survey of the building, Stewart realizes there are survivors trapped in an underground garage. He and Lou crawl into the sewer and through some rubble with a jackhammer, which they use to drill through to the garage. Stewart is overjoyed to find Denise, who is one of the people trapped inside. As he hugs her, he sees his wife standing just behind her.During the rescue, the Mulholland Dam finally gives way, sending water down the sewers. Lou and Denise make it up the ladder to safety, but as Remy climbs out, a man steps on her hand. She falls back into the water which is sweeping people away.

The Godfather Part II,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate. The continuing saga of the Corleone crime family tells the story of a young Vito Corleone growing up in Sicily and in 1910s New York; and follows Michael Corleone in the 1950s as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> The life of Vito Corleone is shown as he becomes from a boy born in Sicily to one of the most respected mafia dons of New York while Micheal attempts to expand his business empire into Las Vegas, Florida and pre-revolution Cuba while facing his own personal problems trying to keep his collapsing marriage and relationship with his brother intact.—ahmetkozan The continuation of the Godfather saga with two focuses: the ongoing story of the Corleone family, and Michael in particular, and Vito Corleone's (Michael's father) backstory. Regarding the ongoing Michael Corleone story, it is about seven years since the events that concluded The Godfather. With the murders of the heads of the other four New York / New Jersey families, the Corleone family has unassailable control in New York. The move to Nevada went smoothly and Michael Corleone controls several hotels and casinos in the state. Frank Pentageli, the man who runs Michael's interests in New York, comes to Michael, asking if he can take out the Rosato Brothers as they are infringing on Pentageli's turf and business interests. However, the Rosatos are backed by Hyman Roth, a business partner of Michael's and a long- time ally of Michael's father, Vito Corleone, and Michael refuses. An assassination attempt is then carried out on Michael, in his own home. Michael investigates who is trying to kill him, and suspects that there is a traitor in his family. Meanwhile, Michael and Hyman Roth fly to Cuba to finalise some business deals there. The Cuban trip reveals all. In a story interwoven with the present day, we see the backstory to Vito Corleone. From how his parents and brother were murdered by a Don in their home town of Corleone in Sicily, to his escaping, as a boy, to New York, his adult life and his rise to Don Corleone.—grantss The childhood of Vito Corleone and his rise from a petty criminal to the most powerful don in New York City during the early 20th century is depicted, whilst his son Don Michael Corleone succumbs to power, greed, and ruthlessness, all for the sake of pride and keeping the Corleone family intact.—goddangwatir The Godfather Part II presents two parallel storylines. One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York.The film begins in 1901, in the town of Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral of young Vito's father, Antonio Andolini, who has been murdered for an insult to the local Mafia lord, Don Ciccio. During the procession, Vito's older brother is murdered because he swore revenge on the Don. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for mercy, but he refuses, knowing that nine-year-old Vito will seek revenge later in life. The mother takes Ciccio hostage at knifepoint, allowing her son to escape, and Ciccio's men kill her. They search the town for the boy, but he is aided in his escape by the townspeople. Vito finds his way by ship to New York, and at Ellis Island an immigration agent chooses Vito's hometown of Corleone as his surname, and he is registered as ""Vito Corleone"".In 1958 in a scene similar to the opening of the first film, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), Godfather of the Corleone family, deals with various business and family problems during an elaborate party at his Lake Tahoe, Nevada compound to celebrate his son's First Communion. In his office, Michael meets with corrupt Nevada Senator Pat Geary (G. D. Spradlin) to discuss the price of the gaming licenses for the hotel/casinos the Family is buying. Geary, who has obvious contempt for Michael and other Italian businessmen who are moving into his state to take advantage of gambling opportunities, promises to make Michael's acquisition of his gaming license a difficult process. Michael ends his conversation with Geary when he refuses to pay the outrageous fee Geary demands, telling the senator he'll get nothing.Michael also deals with his self-indulgent younger sister Connie (Talia Shire), who, although recently divorced from her second husband, is planning to marry a man named Merl Johnson (Troy Donahue) with no obvious means of support and of whom Michael disapproves. Connie is still resentful of her brother having her husband, Carlo, killed years before due to his betrayal of the family. Michael also talks with Johnny Ola (Dominic Chianese), the right hand man of Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who is supporting Michael's move into the gambling industry. Belatedly, Michael deals with Frank ""Five Angels"" Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo), a business associate who took over Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza's territory in New York City after his death, and now has problems with the Rosato Brothers, who are backed by Roth. Pentangeli leaves abruptly, after telling Michael ""your father did business with Hyman Roth, your father respected Hyman Roth, but your father never trusted Hyman Roth.""Later that night, Michael barely escapes an assassination attempt when his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) notices the bedroom window drapes are inexplicably open, which allows two unseen hitmen to spray the bedroom with bullets. The two hitman are found dead having been killed by a ""mole"" within the compound. Afterwards, Michael tells his lawyer and associate Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that the hit was made with the help of someone close, and that he must leave, entrusting all his power to Hagen to protect his family.Flashback: In 1917 New York City, the adult Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) works in a grocery store in the Lower East side with his friend Genco Abbandando. The neighborhood is controlled by a member of the ""The Black Hand,"" Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin), who extorts protection payments from local businesses. One night, Vito's neighbor Clemenza (Bruno Kirby) asks him to hide a stash of guns for him, and later, to repay the favor, takes him to a fancy apartment where they commit their first felony together, stealing an elegant rug.The film flash-forwards to Michael's time. Michael meets with Hyman Roth in Miami, Florida who tells Michael that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt, and that Pentangeli will pay for it. Traveling to Brooklyn, Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it, and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth, but he needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato Brothers in order to put Roth off guard.While sleeping, Fredo gets a phone call in the middle of the night from Johnny Ola, Hyman Roth's right hand man, revealing that Fredo is the traitor in the family. Johnny Ola conspires with Fredo, telling him that Frank Pentangeli is going to make peace with the Rosato Brothers. Johnny Ola asks Fredo information about the meeting between these two parties, and whether or not Pentangeli will be alone. Fredo disagrees to cooperate and tells Johnny Ola to never call him again.When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos at a local bar, he is told ""Michael Corleone says hello,"" as he is attacked from behind but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman. Pentangeli is left for dead, and his bodyguard, Willi Cicci (Joe Spinell), is struck by a car while shooting at the Rosatos as they drive away.Back in Nevada, Tom Hagen is called to a brothel in Carson City run by Michael's older brother Fredo (John Cazale), where Senator Geary is implicated in the death of a prostitute, and Tom offers to take care of the problem in return for ""friendship"" between the Senator and the Corleone family.Meanwhile, Michael meets Roth in Havana, Cuba, in late 1958, at the time when dictator Fulgencio Batista is soliciting American investment, and communist guerrillas are trying to bring down the government. At a birthday party for Roth, Michael mentions that there is a possibility that the rebels might win, making their business dealings in Cuba problematic. Earlier that day, Michael had witnessed a communist rebel kill a Havana policemen by detonating a grenade that also killed the rebel himself. The comment prompts Roth to remark, privately, that Michael has not delivered the two million dollars to firm their partnership.Fredo, carrying the promised money, arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael mentions Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola to him, but Fredo says he has never met them. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him, and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move, and that ""Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.""Instead of turning over the money to Roth, Michael asks him who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. Roth avoids the question, instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend, Moe Greene, which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the first film).Michael has asked Fredo, who knows Havana well, to show Senator Geary and other important officials and businessmen a good time, during which Fredo pretends to not recognize Johnny Ola. Soon after, at a sex show, Fredo comments loudly that Johnny Ola told him about the place, contradicting what he told Michael twice earlier, that he didn't know Roth or Ola. Michael now realizes that the traitor is his own brother, and dispatches his bodyguard to deal with Roth.Johnny Ola is strangled, but Roth, in a delicate state because of his heart condition, is taken to a hospital, where Michael's enforcer is shot trying to kill him. At Batista's New Year's Eve party, at the stroke of midnight, Michael grasps Fredo tightly by the head and kisses him: ""I know it was you Fredo; you broke my heart."" When guerrillas attack, the guests flee, but Fredo refuses to go with Michael, despite Michael's pleas that Fredo is still his brother and that it's the only way out.Flashback (1917): Don Fanucci of the Black Hand is now aware of the partnership between Vito, Clemenza and Sal Tessio (John Aprea), and wants his share of their profits every week. Clemenza and Tessio agree to pay, but Vito is reluctant and asks his friends to leave everything in his hands so Fanucci will accept less and indeed, Vito manages to get Fanucci to take only one sixth of what he demanded ($100 out of $600). Immediately afterward, during the neighborhood festa, Vito murders Fanucci in the hallway outside his apartment and then rejoins his wife and three children on the stoops outside his tenement. Vito tells the infant Michael that his father loves him very much.In January 1959, Nevada, Michael returns to his snow-covered Lake Tahoe compound after fleeing Cuba, where Tom Hagen tells him that Roth escaped from Cuba after suffering a stroke and is recovering in Miami, that Michael's bodyguard is dead, and that Fredo is probably hiding in New York. Hagen also informs Michael that Kay had a miscarriage while he was away. Michael is distraught at the news and furiously demands to know the sex of the child, but Tom is unable to tell him.Flashback (1920): with Fanucci dead and with no one else to take over the Black Hand, Vito earns the respect of the neighborhood and begins to intercede in local disputes, operating out of the storefront of his Genco Pura Olive Oil Company (named after his friend Genco Abbandando) which he manages as well as give out ""favors"" to others in the community such as a local young woman threatened with eviction. Vito intimidates her landlord into letting her stay for a few extra weeks... rent free.In Washington, D.C. of 1959, a Senate committee, of which Senator Geary is a member, is conducting an investigation into the Corleone family. They question disaffected ""soldier"" Willi Cicci about his role as a button man in the Family, but he cannot implicate Michael, because he never received any direct orders from him. When Michael appears before the committee, Senator Geary makes a big show of supporting Italian-Americans and then excuses himself from the proceedings. During questioning, Michael denies all criminal allegations against him, from the murder of Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey back in 1946 (in the first Godfather movie), and to his business status of operating several gambling casinos in Nevada. Michael makes a statement challenging the committee to produce a witness to corroborate the charges against him. The hearing ends with the Chairman promising a witness who will do exactly that.Frank Pentangeli, who survived the attack by the Rosato Brothers, has made a deal with the FBI, and will testify against Michael. Tom Hagen and Michael discuss the problem, observing that Roth's strategy to destroy Michael is well planned. Michael's brother Fredo has been found and persuaded to return to Nevada, and in a private meeting he explains to Michael his betrayal: upset about being passed over to head the family in favor of Michael, he wants respect and his due. He helped Roth thinking there would be something in it for him, but he swears he didn't know they wanted to kill Michael. He also tells Michael that the Senate Committee's chief counsel is Roth's man. Michael then tells Fredo: ""You're nothing to me now. Not a brother, not a friend, nothing"", and privately instructs soldier and button man Al Neri (Richard Bright) that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is still alive.At the hearing in which Frank Pentangeli is to testify, Michael arrives accompanied by Pentangeli's brother, brought from Sicily, and whose presence causes Frank to recant his previous statements about Michael. When Pentangeli is pressed, he claims that he just told the FBI what they wanted to hear. With no witness to testify against Michael, the committee adjourns, with Hagen, acting as Michael's lawyer, loudly demanding an apology.At a hotel room afterwards, Kay tries to leave Michael, taking their children with her. Michael at first tries to mollify her, but loses his temper and hits her violently when she reveals to him that her recent ""miscarriage"" was actually an abortion to avoid providing another child into Michael's criminal inheritance. She also tells him that the baby was a boy, further infuriating Michael.Flashback (1925): While visiting Sicily for a family vacation for the first time in over 20 years, Vito Corleone is introduced to the elderly 90-year-old Don Ciccio as the man who imports their olive oil to America, and who wants his blessing. When Ciccio asks Vito who his father was, Vito says, ""My father's name is Antonio Andolini, and this is for you!"", cutting the old man's stomach open with a knife, avenging the death of his father, mother, and brother. As they make their escape from Ciccio's compound and his men, Don Tomasello is shot in the leg by one of Ciccio's bodyguards, giving him a permanent limp.In April 1959, Carmella Corleone (Morgana King), Vito's widow and the mother of his children, dies, and the whole Corleone family is reunited for her funeral. Michael still shuns Fredo, who is miserable, but relents when Connie implores him to. Michael and Fredo embrace, but at the same time Michael signals to his capo that Fredo's protection from harm, in effect while their mother lived, has now run out.Michael, Tom Hagen, and Rocco Lampone discuss their final dealings with Hyman Roth, who has been unsuccessfully seeking asylum from various countries, and was even refused entry to Israel as a returned Jew. Michael rejects Hagen's advice that the Corleone family's position is secure, and killing Roth and the Rosato brothers for revenge is an unnecessary risk. Later, Hagen pays a visit to the imprisoned Frank Pentangeli on a military base and suggests that he take his own life, in the manner of unsuccessful ancient Roman conspirators who, in return, were promised that their families would be taken care of after their suicide.With the connivance of Connie, Kay visits her children, but cannot bear to leave them and stays too long. When Michael arrives, he coldly closes the door in her face.The movie reaches its climax in a montage of assassinations and death, reminiscent of the end of Part One:As he arrives at an airport to be taken into custody, Hyman Roth is killed by Rocco Lampone, disguised as a journalist, who himself is immediately shot dead by Roth's bodyguards.On the military base, Frank Pentangeli is found dead, having followed Hagen's instructions and committed suicide in his bathtub.Fredo is murdered by Al Neri while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe - while Fredo is saying a Hail Mary to help catch a fish.The penultimate scene takes place late in 1941, and the Corleone family is preparing a surprise birthday party for their father Vito. Sonny (James Caan) introduces Carlo Rizzi (Gianni Russo), Connie's future husband and betrayer of Sonny, to his family. They all talk about the recent attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, and Michael shocks everybody by announcing that he has just enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Sonny ridicules Michael's choice, and Tom Hagen mentions how his father has great expectations for Michael. Fredo is the only one who supports his brother's decision. Sal Tessio comes in with the cake for the party, and when Vito arrives, all but Michael leave the room to greet him.The final shot in the film is Michael sitting by himself at Lake Tahoe, in silent contemplation."

When the pilot of a small aircraft has a heart attack and crashes his plane into the cockpit of a Boeing 747, several members of the flight crew are killed and the pilot is blinded. Miraculously, the 747 stays in the air on auto-pilot with flight attendant Nancy Prior at the controls. Ground controllers, including her boyfriend Alan Murdock, try to teach her the basics but they soon realize they will have to get a trained pilot into the cockpit. Their first attempt fails and Murdock realizes he will have to do it.

Failure to make this meeting threatens half his sales commissions for the coming year. He is en route in his private Beechcraft Baron.However, an occluded storm front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. That not only affects the Columbia flight but also precludes Freeman making his meeting in Boise. Both flights are diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport.Freeman's small plane and the giant Boeing 747 enter Salt Lake's entry pattern. Air traffic control assigns the jumbo to enter the pattern first at a low altitude of 10,000 feet, followed by the Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is making its final approach, the co-pilot and First Officer Urias (Roy Thinnes) feels a vibration on one of the adjacent panels and rises to check it out. Freeman, anxious about his missed meeting, makes a call to the Salt Lake Tower asking about the delay. The tower confirms that he is second to land after the big jet. Freeman suddenly suffers a massive heart attack. As he grabs his chest, the Baron falls out of the pattern and descends into the approach of Columbia 409.The Beechcraft impacts the flight deck just above the co-pilot seat. Freeman is instantly killed by the impact as his small plane explodes. First Officer Urias, still standing, is instantly blown from the cockpit. Navigator and Flight Engineer Julio (Erik Estrada) is struck on the head by debris and killed. Captain Stacey (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) is struck in the face by debris and is blinded.The impact knocks a male flight attendant from the upper lounge down to the cabin below. Nancy Pryor (Karen Black), the head flight attendant, rushes up to the flight deck to find Urias gone, Julio dead, and Stacey badly maimed. Fortunately, the captain is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch to keep the aircraft in the air before losing consciousness.Nancy informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She is told to stay on the same radio frequency. Nancy gives the assessment of the damage as a large hole on the starboard side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station.Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Flight 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdoch (Charlton Heston), Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's former lover. Patroni takes a personal intrest in Flight 409 because his wife (Susan Clark) is on board the plane with their eldest son.Patroni and Murdoch take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake City. En route, they communicate with Nancy, who is still in the cockpit in the pilot's seat. While the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, it is inoperable for turns. Something has to be done, as the jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains. After successfully guiding Nancy by radio on how to perform the turn, radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.With the low-flying plane unable to turn, leaking fuel, and dodging the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from a jet-powered HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant helicopter flown by the USAF Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. While the pilot is preparing to be released on a tether, it becomes apparent that Flight 409 is heading straight into the side of a mountain. With radio communications still out, Nancy flies the plane unaided.The badly wounded Captain Stacey is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Nancy realizes that she must accelerate the engines to be able to climb over the mountain and successfully does so. After Flight 409 has leveled off, the pilot is released on a tow line from the helicopter towards the stricken airliner. Just as Nancy is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. As he climbs in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls to his death.The only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Captain Murdock. He is tethered to the rear of the helicopter, lowered to the jet and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. Despite the controls being smashed and with serious damage to the landing breaks, he then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City Airport, where the flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the inflatable slides on the left side of the 747. Patroni is reunited with his wife and son, and Nancy and Captain Murdock walk away from the damaged plane."

On the way they stumble across what appears to be a deserted house, only to discover something sinister within. Something armed with a chainsaw. En route to visit their grandfather's grave (which has apparently been ritualistically desecrated), five teenagers drive past a slaughterhouse, pick up (and quickly drop) a sinister hitch-hiker, eat some delicious home-cured meat at a roadside gas station, before ending up at the old family home... where they're plunged into a never-ending nightmare as they meet a family of cannibals who more than make up in power tools what they lack in social skills...—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> The year is 1974. A group of five close friends are heading through the back roads of Texas en route to their grandfather's potentially vandalized grave. Among them are Sally Hardesty, and her invalid brother Franklin. They encounter an unpleasant hitchhiker (Neal) who slashes both himself & Franklin with a wicked-looking knife. The others manage to eject the hitchhiker from the vehicle, but shortly after wards, they are forced to stop & wander over to a small, sinister clapboard house nearby in hopes for gas. What none of them realize is that this house is the home of the ghoulish Leatherface (Hansen) and his evil, demented family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One at a time, the teens are murdered by the Leatherface in horrifying ways. Sally soon finds herself an involuntary guest at Leatherface's home, and flees into the night to escape the demented cannibal and his loudly-buzzing chainsaw. Can she escape the grim fate that befell her friends & brother? Based on the terrifying true story of Ed Gein.—Derek O'Cain A group of five hippies on a road trip through the backwaters of 1970's rural Texas fall prey to a murderous cannibalistic family making up of a leather-masked chainsaw-wielding maniac, his knife-wielding grave robber brother, and their cannibal chief father and decaying grandfather.—Jayjay Upon hearing that vandals have desecrated a graveyard where her grandfather is buried, Sally recruits her boyfriend Jerry, her brother Franklyn, and her friends Pam and Kirk to investigate. On a side trip to the grandfather's deserted farm, the travellers pick up a slimy hitchhiker who cuts himself and slashes Franklyn. After arriving at the farm, Pam and Kirk search for an old swimming hole--Kirk hears a generator and believes he can find some gasoline. He enters the house hoping to find the owner. Unfortunately, this is the home of the hitchhiker, as well as Leatherface, who has some surprises for the travellers consisting of sledgehammers, chainsaws, and assorted cutlery.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> The film opens on the date of August 18, 1973 by revealing that a cemetery in rural Texas has been vandalized; several gravesites have been desecrated, the bodies dug up and arranged into bizarre ""sculptures"". Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her invalid, wheelchair-bound brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), are concerned that their grandfather's grave may have been vandalized, so they travel to the site with three of their friends, Sally's boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger), her best friend Pam (Teri McMinn), and Pam's boyfriend Kirk (William Vail). When they discover that the grave is intact, they decide to visit the old family homestead which is now abandoned.Along the way, they pass a slaughterhouse and Franklin describes how cattle used to be killed with a sledgehammer, and now they use an air gun. Shortly afterwards, they pick up a skinny, strange-looking hitch hiker (Edwin Neal) who exhibits bizarre behavior. After inviting the group back to his house for dinner, an invitation they all decline, the hitchhiker takes a photo of Franklin with an instant polarid camara, and demands a two-dollar payment for it. When Franklin refuses, the man angrily crumples the photo, sets it on fire, and cuts his own hand with Franklin's pocket knife. The guys manage to throw him out of the van, but not before he cuts Franklin with the knife, too. Before they can drive away, he smears blood on their van.Running low on fuel, they stop at a rural Gulf filling station, only to have the strange-looking old man who runs it (Jim Siedow) tell them that the tanks are empty and that he's waiting for the gas tanker to show up. When the old man learns that their destination is the old Hardesty home, he advises the young people against going there by saying that the people who live around that area are not receptive to strangers. They buy some barbeque sandwiches from the old man and depart for the family home which they finaly arrive a short while later.While Sally and Pam go off to look through the abandoned house, Franklin finds it hard to get around the old place due to his wheelchair, and he is frustrated by the fun that the two couples seem to be having.Franklin gives Pam and Kirk directions to an old swimming hole that used to be nearby, but they find it completely dried up. Kirk hears the sound of a gas generator nearby and gets the idea to find out where it is and barter for some gasoline. Following the sound, they discover a large farm house surrounded by numerous abandonded vehicles, partially hidden by a large tarp. Kirk finds a human tooth on the front porch and frightens Pam with it. He gets no answer to a knock at the door, and he is lured inside by strange animal sounds. He goes into the house and in the space of a few moments, an enormous heavyset man in a weird mask (Gunnar Hansen) appears and murders him with a blow to the head via sledgehammer. The man, known as ""Leatherface"" due to his mask made out of a human face, drags the body into a back room.Pam becomes restless when Kirk does not return, and she goes into the house to look for him. She stumbles into a room that is filled with human and animal bones. A live chicken dangles in a small bird cage. Weird sculptures made out of human skulls hang from the ceiling. Furniture is adorned with human bones and skulls. The floor is covered with bits of bones and feathers. Pam begins to retch and starts screaming, when Leatherface appears and lunges for her. She runs out onto the porch but he catches her, carrying her kicking and screaming back into the house, where he savagely hangs her on a meat hook through her back. While she hangs there, she can see Leatherface dismembering the dead body of Kirk with a chainsaw.Back at the Hardesty house, Sally and the others start to wonder why Pam and Kirk have not returned. As the sun begins to set, Jerry sets out in the general direction and also comes upon the house after he is lured to the area by the sound of the house's gas generator. He is alerted by the blanket that Kirk left hanging on the front porch, and he goes into the house. After Jerry walks into the kitchen, he discovers Pam locked inside a large freezer, still alive but convulsing and near death. She lunges out of the freezer just as Leatherface appears and kills Jerry with the sledgehammer. He forces Pam's body back into the freezer and locks it again. Leatherface is clearly distraught, apparently upset because strangers keep coming to his house.At nightfall, Sally and Franklin are forced to go after Jerry when he does not return; Jerry took the keys to the van with him when he left. Franklin refuses to wait at the van and insists that Sally push his wheelchair along the unpaved path through the woods. Before they get to the house, they are attacked by Leatherface, who murders Franklin by ramming him in the chest with a chainsaw. Sally flees in terror with Leatherface directly behind her. She gets cut on the thorny brush as she runs, eventually reaching the house; she is unaware that the house belongs to her pursuer. Sally runs upstairs as Leatherface saws through the front door to get at her. In an upstairs bedroom, she finds two dessicated figures, an old man and old woman. The woman is long dead, but the old man is still barely alive, hideously withered. Leatherface corners her on the second floor, so she leaps out a window and runs from the house again with him right behind her.Sally reaches the gas station and Leatherface disappears. The old man says he's going to take Sally to get help, and while he's gone Sally notices the smoke pit where the barbeque is made. She stares at it in fascination. The old man returns and suddenly attacks Sally, who tries to defend herself with a kitchen knife. But the old man knocks the knife out of Sally's hand with a broom. The old man beats Sally unconcious with the broom, uses the knife to cut some twine to tie her up, he then puts a gunny sack over her head and forcing her into his pickup truck. He drives her back to the dreaded house, and along the way picks up the hitch hiker from earlier in the day. They all live there, along with Leatherface. They tie Sally to a chair inside the house and remove the bag from her
head. She and the hitch hiker recognize one another and Sally screams in horror.The family torments her for the rest of the night, forcing her to sit at their table while they eat a meal that is obviously made up of human flesh. They bring ""Grandpa"" down from upstairs, the dessicated old man, and slice Sally's finger open, sticking it in the old man's mouth while he sucks her blood. They tell Sally that ""Grandpa"" used to work in the
slaughterhouse and was the best with a sledgehammer there was. They decide to let Grandpa kill Sally and untie her, forcing her onto her knees and holding her head over a bucket while Grandpa makes several feeble attempts to hit her head with a hammer. The hitch hiker gets frustrated and makes a grab for the hammer to finish her off, and suddenly Sally breaks free. She hurls herself out a window again and lands outside just as dawn begins to break.The hitchhiker and Leatherface emerge from the house and chase Sally up to the road, the hitch hiker brandishing a knife and Leatherface waving the chainsaw. The hitchhiker very nearly catches her, grabbing for her and catching her hair over and over. A large semi drives by and the hitch hiker is caught off guard; the truck drives over him, killing him. The truck driver slows down and gets out of the rig to see what happened, only to be confronted by a screaming, bloodied Sally with Leatherface close behind, the chainsaw buzzing. He chases Sally and the truck driver to the other side of the cab, when the driver hurls a wrench at him and hits him in the side of the head. Leatherface drops the saw and falls, wounded in the leg by the saw blade. The truck driver flees down the road, but the wounded Sally cannot catch up. Then a pickup truck drives by and Sally abandons the scene by jumping in the back of the truck. Leatherface still gives chase, but the pickup driver pulls away. Sally laughs crazily at Leatherface as she escapes, giggling at him as he swings his chainsaw around in frustration and rage in the middle of the road in the full light of dawn."
Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072288/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"With the help of an irreverent young sidekick, a bank robber gets his old gang back together to organize a daring new heist. Seven years after a daring bank robbery involving an anti-tank gun used to blow open a vault, the robbery team temporarily puts aside their mutual suspicions to repeat the crime after they are unable to find the loot from the original heist, hidden behind a school chalkboard. The hardened artilleryman and his flippant, irresponsible young sidekick are the two wild cards in the deck of jokers.—<booda@datasync.com> A middle aged man nicknamed Thunderbolt (Clint Eastwood) has been masquerading as a preacher at a church located in the western American countryside. When he is found by one of the many who know who he really is, Thunderbolt is able to escape when he literally runs into a twenty-something man nicknamed Lightfoot (Jeff Bridges) (in reality, when Lightfoot runs into him). Despite not knowing anything about the other, the two decide to hang out together since they seem to have a similar temperament as two good old boys who have a penchant for doing things to bring them on the wrong side of the law. As they travel the American west together, there are people on their tail trying to kill them. When Lightfoot brings up the topic of robbing a bank, Thunderbolt's true history comes to light: he's a bank robber whose last job netted five hundred thousand dollars still hidden where only he of the surviving team members knows. The media reported that the money had been recovered, which, in reality, was a sting operation by the Police to draw out the robbers. It, however, led to Thunderbolt's accomplices believing he double-crossed them, hence the reason they now want him dead. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot learn that recovering the money may be a difficult task at the same time that two of Thunderbolt's old team members, Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis) and Red Leary (George Kennedy), who are out to kill him, also learn the truth that the money was never recovered, and that Thunderbolt did not double cross them. In light of these new circumstances, Lightfoot believes he has an ingenious plan which requires the assistance of the old team, which, if successful, would make them all rich. Will the magic happen this second time around with Lightfoot added to the mix? And will old and new allegiances hold fast through to the completion of the scheme?—Huggo"
Death Wish,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071402/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A New York City architect becomes a one-man vigilante squad after his wife is murdered by street punks. In self-defense, the vengeful man kills muggers on the mean streets after dark. Open-minded architect Paul Kersey returns to New York City from vacationing with his wife, feeling on top of the world. At the office, his cynical coworker gives him the welcome-back with a warning on the rising crime rate. But Paul, a bleeding-heart liberal, thinks of crime as being caused by poverty. However his coworker's ranting proves to be more than true when Paul's wife is killed and his daughter is raped in his own apartment. The police have no reliable leads and his overly sensitive son-in-law only exacerbates Paul's feeling of hopelessness. He is now facing the reality that the police can't be everywhere at once. Out of sympathy his boss gives him an assignment in sunny Arizona where Paul gets a taste of the Old West ideals. He returns to New York with a compromised view on muggers...—Don Hoffman Paul Kersey, a successful Manhattan architect, seems to have it all: a supportive wife, a lovely daughter, and a peaceful life. But happiness is an illusion. And when a sadistic gang of street thugs robs Paul of everything he holds dear, he soon realises he's on his own--sadly, the efforts of the local police department to find the culprits are embarrassingly fruitless. More and more, the sense of injustice gives way to an irrepressible desire for revenge, leaving the once quiet family man with no choice. As a result, bent on cleaning New York's mean streets, Paul summons up the courage to take the law into his own hands and become a self-appointed executioner. And now that Kersey has tasted the forbidden fruit of vigilante justice, no mugger or killer is safe from harm and his deadly .32 calibre Colt Police Positive revolver. What will it take to stop the bloody crusade and Paul Kersey, the man with the death wish?—Nick Riganas Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) and his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) vacation in Hawaii. They return to New York City, where Paul works as an architect.Joanna and their daughter Carol Anne (Kathleen Tolan) shop for groceries at D'Agostino's. Three hooligans (one played byJeff Goldblum) are wreaking havoc in the supermarket. They catch Joanna's address after she asks that her groceries be delivered. They follow her to the apartment, burst in, and trash the apartment. They search for money but find only $7. The hooligans then rape Carol and savagely beat Joanna, escaping scot-free.Paul's son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) calls to tell him only that Joanna and Carol are in the hospital. After waiting impatiently, Paul is told by a doctor that his daughter is okay and that she was sedated and put to bed, but his wife has died. Devastated, he is told by police that the likelihood of catching the criminals is small since his wife is dead and his daughter, the only witness, traumatized from her ordeal of being raped, cannot speak. That night, a frustrated Paul goes out for a walk and quickly encounters a mugger who attempts to rob him with a gun. Carrying a sock full of quarters, Paul swings it at the would-be-mugger and flees, narrowly escaping from being shot.The next day, Paul's boss gives him an extended business vacation to Tucson, Arizona to meet a client, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who shows him the ropes. Paul witnesses a mock gunfight at Old Tucson, a reconstructed Western frontier town used as a movie set. At a gun club, Ames is impressed when Paul shoots near bulls-eye accuracy. He reveals that he was a ""CO"" (conscientious objector) during the Korean War who served his country as a combat medic. Ames drops him at the airport, slipping a little going-away present into Paul's bag.Back in New York, Paul visits Jack who tells him that his daughter is catatonic and will likely never recover. At home, Paul opens his suitcase and the gift box that Ames left him to find a nickel-plated .32 Colt Police Positive revolver. He pockets the gun and takes a stroll that night. While walking alone in Riverside Park, Paul almost immediately encounters a mugger, a doped-up ex-convict named Thomas Leroy Marston who attempts to rob him at gunpoint with a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 36 revolver. Paul shoots him with his .32 revolver, killing him.Shocked that he just killed a human being, Paul runs home and throws up. But his vigilantism continues the following night when he guns down three black men (one with an afro is played by an uncreditedLawrence Hilton-Jacobs) who are robbing a defenseless old man in a vacant alley.A few nights later, two muggers see Paul on a subway, holding a bag of groceries. They attempt to rob him at knife-point but Paul shoots them both with the revolver. Paul again gets away.Another night later, Paul is sitting in a sleazy 8th Avenue coffee shop surrounded by prostitutes and assorted street people. He pays his bill to the cashier purposely revealing a wallet full of cash. He leaves followed by two black thugs, named George and Joseph, who have taken the bait. Yet again a robbery attempt is made in a subway tunnel. Paul shoots one but the other manages to stab him in his shoulder before he gets shot as well. As a wounded Paul stumbles off, the one who stabbed him gets away mortally wounded, dying at a hospital.Police Lt. Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows the list to men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers and who are war veterans. The public, meanwhile, is happy that somebody is doing something about crime.Lt. Ochoa soon suspects Paul. He is about to make an arrest when the District Attorney (Fred J. Scollay) intervenes and tells Ochoa to ""let him loose"" in another city instead. Ochoa doesn't like the idea, but relents.In the meantime, Paul has his daughter committed to a mental hospital in upstate New Hampshire where she will remain catatonic, possibly for life. After returning to New York, Paul hides his .32 gun in a hidden drawer in his office while adjusting to (and possibly enjoying) committing murder against muggers to ""clean up the city"". When Paul invites Jack over for dinner, Jack cannot understand Paul's sudden and happy mood.(Note: The three muggers who murdered Paul's wife and assaulted his daughter are never seen again in the movie, so their fate is left ambiguous.)One evening, Lt. Ochoa anonymously phones Paul at his office to tip him off that the police are watching him, hoping to provoke a reaction or slip up from Paul. When Paul is briefly detained by the police after leaving his office, they do not find any gun on him and allow him to continue on his way.Aware that the police are starting to catch on to him, Paul gives them the slip by sneaking out of his apartment building through a backdoor service entrance. He goes to his office to retrieve his gun and then goes out looking for more would-be muggers where he is confronted by three street gang members in Central Park who try to mug him. Paul shoots two of them before he is wounded in his right leg by a third mugger who is armed with a .45 caliber M1911A1 pistol. Despite his wound, Paul chases the third mugger through the park, the streets, and to an industrial warehouse area where the third mugger gets away as Paul attempts to take aim at him, only to fall to the ground.Hospitalized, Paul is confronted by Ochoa after a sympathetic policeman finds Paul's revolver near the latest crime scene and gives it to the detective. Ochoa makes Paul promise to leave New York, permanently in exchange to avoid prosecution for the vigilante killings. Paul replies, ""By sundown?""In the final scene, set one week later. Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train. Being greeted by a company representative, he notices a group of hoodlums harassing a woman. He excuses himself and helps the woman. The hoodlums make obscene gestures, but Kersey points his right hand like a gun and smiles... suggesting that his vigilantism will resume sooner or later."

As Bond tries to shed light on the knotty mystery of the elusive killer who kills for sport and the theft of a pocket-size technological wonder, his unknown nemesis weaves a dangerous web of illusions, luring the British spy into the heart of exotic, peril-laden Macau. But how do you trace someone who doesn't exist? Can James Bond find the ace shooter first and stop the man with the golden gun?—Nick Riganas Francisco Scaramanga, a hitman who is known as ""the man with the golden gun"", because of the golden gun he carries, and the gold bullets he uses on his targets.

Scaramanga and Anders leave the beach, a short time later a gangster, Rodney, arrives and is met by Nick-Nack, a dwarf who works as a servant for Scaramanga. Rodney has been hired by Nick-Nack to kill Scaramanga, who has promised to leave everything he owns to his small servant. The gangster stalks Scaramanga through a funhouse-like wing of his home. Scaramanga has been caught without his gun and must find it first. He does so and is able to kill his would-be assassin first. Nick-Nack jovially tells Scaramanga he will find an adversary that will beat his master; the two seem to have an unspoken agreement that humors them both. Scaramanga picks up the gangster's gun and turns suddenly, shooting the fingers off a nearby wax dummy of James Bond.MI6's top agent, James Bond, has been called to the office of his boss, M. M asks what Bond knows about Scaramanga, to which Bond recites a laundry list of characteristics, the most important being that Scaramanga charges $1 million per assassination, uses gold bullets marked with then name of his target and is known as ""The Man with the golden gun."" M shows Bond a gold bullet, assumed to be one of Scaramanga's, marked with Bond's service number, ""007"" and a partial fingerprint of the villain's. Bond is puzzled as to why anyone would want him killed and M orders him to travel to Beirut.In Beirut, Bond speaks with an exotic dancer who is the last person to see a fellow agent 002 alive who had allegedly been killed by Scaramanga. Bond finds that the woman has kept the gold bullet since her lover's death and uses it as a lucky charm which she holds in her navel. A small group of thugs break into her dressing room and Bond, in the middle of kissing the woman's abdomen, swallows the bullet. He takes it back to Q who, along with an metallurgist, is able to identify the manufacturer, a man named Lazar who lives in Macau. Bond is sent there to investigate and, while threatening Lazar, is shown an order for more of the gold bullets to be delivered shortly. Bond accompanies Lazar to the drop point, a local casino, where they are picked up by Andrea Anders.Bond trails Anders to Hong Kong but loses her at the hydrofoil port. He meets his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Bond finds out where Anders is staying and enters her hotel room and roughly interrogates her, citing the bullet sent to MI6 with his number on it. She admits she works for Scaramanga, both as a courier but also as his lover; Scaramanga, like a bullfighter, uses her for sex before he makes a kill. Bond also finds out that Scaramanga is due to be at the Bottoms Up exotic dancers club that night. While staking the club, Bond sees Nick-Nack nearby. As he watches, a man exits the club and is immediately shot by Scaramanga, who is hiding nearby. The man, Gibson, is a solar energy expert. Bond is arrested by Lieutenant Hip as a suspect in the murder. Hip takes Bond to the rusted hulk of the RMS Queen Elizabeth (actually ruined by fire in 1972) in Hong Kong harbor, which turns out to be MI6's base of Asian Operations; M is there. Bond is informed that Gibson's invention, the Solex Agitator, a small but powerful device used to convert solar energy into electricity, had been stolen from him immediately after the shooting. Scaramanga had been hired to kill Gibson by a Chinese gangster, Hai Fat. Because Fat had never met Scaramanga face-to-face, Bond is able to impersonate the killer; he even has Q supply him with a fake third nipple, one of Scaramanga's known physical characteristics.Bond travels to Bangkok and Fat's home. Fat invites Bond back to his house for dinner that evening, however, Bond is unaware that Scaramanga himself has already met with Fat in person. Fat arranges for Bond to be killed when he arrives. When Bond shows up at Fat's place, he is subdued and captured by Nick-Nack & two sumo wrestlers. Nick-Nack nearly stabs Bond but is stopped by Fat, who sends Bond to a nearby martial arts dojo. The class' best student engages Bond in combat but Bond defeats him and jumps through a window. Hip arrives with his nieces, who beat the students with their own skill at martial arts. When they jump in Hip's car, they take off without Bond, who must escape using a high-powered canal boat, chased by Thai long-tail boats, and comically assisted by a chance run-in with Sheriff Pepper (from Live and Let Die) who is vacationing in Thailand with his wife.Back at Hai Fat's house Scaramanga kills the gangster (the gun he uses is assembled from personal items such as a ball point pen, cigarette lighter and a cuff link) and takes control of his assets. Bond plans to spend a romantic evening with Goodnight at their hotel room but they are interrupted by Anders. Bond sleeps with her and she confesses she is afraid of Scaramanga. She asks Bond to kill him. Bond says he will do so but only in exchange for the Solex. Bond goes to a kickboxing match where Anders is waiting. She is dead, having been killed in public by Scaramanga, who had discovered her betrayal. Scaramanga introduces himself to Bond, while Nick-Nack covers him with a tiny pistol. Scaramanga tells of his circus up-bringing, how he made his first kill, and warns Bond not to follow him, while Bond locates the Solex on the floor among the spilled contents of Anders' purse, and covertly passes it to Hip, disguised as a peanut seller. Hip passes the Solex to Goodnight, waiting outside. Scaramanga and Nick-Nack leave the arena, but find Goodnight trying to plant a tracking device in Scaramanga's car and lock her in the trunk. Bond pursues in a stolen car. He chases Scaramanga along a canal and nearly loses him when Scaramanga mysteriously appears on the other side of the water. Not able to find a suitable bridge nearby, Bond drives his car across a wrecked bridge, executing a corkscrew jump and landing on the other bank. Meanwhile, Scaramanga reaches a barn where his car is converted into a plane and takes off, Goodnight still in the trunk. Bond is again arrested.Goodnight's tracking unit informs MI6 and Bond that Scaramanga has returned to his private island off the coast of China (actually the Khao Phing Kan archipelago on the west coast of Thailand). Bond flies there under radar and lands. He is met by Nick-Nack and Scaramanga and given a tour of the facility. Scaramanga shows how the Solex provides power for his compound. Though he doesn't understand the science involved, Scaramanga knows the applications can extend to weapons; he destroys Bond's sea plane with a blast from a laser weapon in his control room. Scaramanga plans to hand over the Solex technology to whomever pays him the highest price for it. He also reveals that he has long desired to duel with Bond to see whom is the better marksman. Bond agrees to the match.The two face off with Scaramanga stalking Bond through his compound and Nick-Nack keeping tabs on the match from a control console. After several minutes of both gunmen evading each other, Bond gains the advantage by taking the place of the wax dummy that resembles him; Scaramanga enters the room and is shot dead by Bond. In the meantime, Goodnight has subdued the bodyguard Scaramanga had posted in the electric generator room and the man falls into a vat of liquid nitrogen. The change in temperature upsets the balance needed to maintain production and the compound begins to self-destruct. Bond is able to regain the Solex and he and Goodnight escape the compound before its destruction.To reach civilization, Bond takes Scaramanga's personal junk and leaves the island with Goodnight. On the boat, finally able to enjoy some romantic time alone, they are attacked by Nick-Nack, who begins a surprisingly furious battle with Bond. Bond is able to trap the diminutive servant in a suitcase and takes him on deck. When he returns, Goodnight is horrified, thinking that Bond threw the midget overboard, however, Bond has locked him in a small cage. As they begin their romantic encounter again, Bond and Goodnight are once again interrupted by a call from M, which the two ignore."

Richelieu enlists Rochefort to kidnap Constance, the Queen's go-between and D'Artagnan's love. The Cardinal uses the wily, amoral Milady de Winter to distract D'Artagnan. But soon, she is D'Artagnan's sworn enemy, and she has an unfortunate history with Athos as well. Milady goes to England to dispatch Buckingham; the Musketeers fight the rebels. Milady, with Rochefort's help, then turns to her personal agenda. Can D'Artagnan save Constance, defeat Rochefort, slip de Winter's ire, and stay free of the Cardinal? All for one, one for all.—<jhailey@hotmail.com> (Sequel to The Three Musketeers)Porthos (Frank Finlay) recaps the events leading to D'Artagnan (Michael York) becoming a musketeer. The original trio, including Porthos' companions Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) and Athos (Oliver Reed) find themselves on a rescue mission behind enemy lines during the battle of La Rochelle. D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chaplin) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market. When she picks a melon from a basket, a hand appears from within and seizes her. While she is taken away, D'Artagnan engages his enemy in a duel and manages to deliver a slicing blow to Rochefort's hand; Rochefort upsets a cart of potatoes, which spills and buries D'Artagnan. He is rescued by the mysterious and beautiful spy Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway) and taken to her private home. He regains consciousness in her bedroom where she is attending him while attired in revealing lingerie, but despite her charms he departs hastily, promising to come back and ""thank her properly."" When he leaves, Milady undresses and prepares to step into her bath, but recoils when she sees the water is tinged red. Rochefort was hiding there, letting his injured hand bleed into her bathwater. As they embrace, they agree to deal with D'Artagnan later.Back at the musketeers' training facility, D'Artagnan ponders his problems while Porthos demonstrates a new sword technique. He flings the sword from its scabbard to sail through the air and hit its mark. Aramis is unimpressed and shows him that the sword could easily be deflected, and they leave arguing the finer points of disarming oneself.An inebriated Athos appears to question D'Artagnan about his new lover. He replies the he loves Milady with his head and Constance with his heart. When asked if he has not ever lost his heart, Athos grows reflective and relates a love story about a man who, unlike him, did lose his heart. It becomes apparent that he is speaking of himself in his life before he became a musketeer. As a nobleman he was a man of honor who fell in love with a mysterious woman and married her, bestowing his title and wealth on her. One day when she fell from her horse, the garter she always wore on her upper arm slipped to reveal the brand of the fleur de lis, identifying her as a criminal. In that moment he lost his honor. Though he had throttled her in his anger, he never knew whether or not she had died. He warns D'Artagnan that such women cause trouble, and the young musketeer agrees that he should stay faithful to Constance.Still needing to repay his debt, D'Artagnan returns to Milady's home and is admitted by her attendant Kitty (Nicole Calfan). Her mistress is away and Kitty has her own interests, so they slip into her bedroom. When Milady returns, Kitty stalls for time and D'Artagnan overhears Milady talking to Kitty about Constance while donning her jewels for the evening; D'Artagnan slips out and re-enters by the front door to pay his proper visit to Milady in her bedroom. Afterward, he calmly asks her where she has taken Constance, and when he grabs her arm the garter there pulls away from a brand of the fleur de lis, and Milady produces two glass daggers filled with acid to attack him. He manages to grab his sword and hold her at bay while he leaves the bedroom, clad only in the sheet, and locks the door. Kitty hands him a cloak and he jumps out the window to escape, finding he has Milady's necklace in his hand. Kitty finally releases her mistress from the bedroom and endures her frustrated blows.Later at the bar, Porthos asks D'Artagnan for money and the necklace slips from his pocket. Athos recognizes it at once, confirming that his wife is still alive. D'Artagnan promises to keep it a secret from the others. Later he goes to the palace to see if the Queen can help find Constance, and is instead captured by the Cardinal's men and taken to his private office. Richelieu remarks upon D'Artagnan's continued good luck and offers friendship in return for the musketeer becoming one of his men, but D'Artagnan refuses and Richelieu warns him that his journey into the battlefront at La Rochelle will be a perilous one.Milady and Rochefort discuss Constance, whom the spy has sent to a private estate. Kitty dutifully gives the information to the musketeers, who agree to help rescue her while D'Artagnan goes ahead toward the battlefront. Constance is fettered in an upstairs room but manages to land a kick on one of the guards when he brings her food; once she has freed herself she runs to the window and finds the courtyard is filled with vicious attack dogs, preventing her escape. The next time a guard comes, she kicks him in the groin before realizing it is Aramis in disguise and she is being rescued. Porthos uses stilts to cross the courtyard with Constance perched on his shoulders to avoid the dogs. The three take her to the convent at Armentieres.D'Artagnan stops at an inn where he plans to meet his friends and finds a note that they were thrown in jail for drunken behavior and sent on a few bottles of wine to drink their health. He declines, saying they will share the wine when they're together again.On the road D'Artagnan is set upon by Rochefort and his hired men, and when the other three musketeers hear dueling in the frigid weather, they join the fray, fighting on an icy lake with unpredictable footing. Still they manage to defeat the gang and take one with them to the inn to question him. He reveals that a meeting is planned at the Red Dove Cote Inn, begs for a drink and is poured some of the wine. Before the others join him, Aramis holds them back as the man quickly goes into convulsions and dies. Sniffing the wine, Aramis says it has been poisoned, probably by Milady.At the Red Dove Cote Inn, Milady meets with the Cardinal and discusses her agenda to rid herself and Rochefort of D'Artagnan and Constance after she does her duty in handling Buckingham, but the Cardinal is unconcerned with her private affairs. She asks for no money for dealing with the duke; she asks instead for carte blanche to deal with her enemies in her own way, and Richelieu produces a vague and craftily written note with his authorization but no words which can be used against him. She tucks it away after he leaves, but suddenly Athos appears and confronts her for the first time since the fateful day when she robbed him of his honor. He asks her for the note, threatening to shoot her if she refuses. Knowing he is capable of it, she surrenders the note.On the battlefield the musketeers have been sent to lend support and see that La Rochelle falls. Athos makes a bet that the four of them can breach the enemy lines and have breakfast atop the bastion--a place where they can discuss matters without the Cardinal's spies within earshot--and they assign Planchet (Roy Kinnear) to bring the ammunition and provisions. They dodge bullets and manage to set up their meal, and Athos gives the note to D'Artagnan and tells them all of the plot to kill Buckingham. Planchet will be assigned to go warn Buckingham, and when the rebels charge the battlement, Athos finds the wall is weak enough that they can push it over to send its stones toppling down on the charging rebels.Milady travels to England to meet Buckingham but fails to convince him to cease aiding the rebels. Outside she prepares a concealed pistol but is caught and sent to the dungeon under the care of his servant Felton (Michael Gothard), a Puritan whose unbreakable faith and detached demeanor the duke trusts. During one visit to check on his prisoner, Milady asks Felton for a Bible, and during his duties he hears her reciting scripture nonstop. Finally she collapses and tells him that she is being persecuted by the Antichrist--Buckingham--and he yields to his doubts and her passions, and later he helps her escape. He proceeds to purchase a knife, meets Buckingham on the docks and uses the weapon to attack his master, who dies from his wounds while Planchet arrives moments too late to warn him.The battle of La Rochelle ends and Rochefort and Milady race the musketeers to Armentieres to claim Constance. The musketeers reach the town nearby just steps ahead of Rochefort, and when they stop for a rest, he gains the lead. The four men remount and give chase, enter the convent by another route but are met by Rochefort and his men. While D'Artagnan and the others battle, the barn next to the convent catches fire, adding to the urgency. Porthos manages to use his new sword technique to dispatch an opponent but catches fire himself; Athos sustains another arm injury and Rochefort escapes.Milady enters the convent disguised as a nun and goes into Constance's room to sit with her. Constance doesn't recognize her in the vestments, continues praying and starts to cry. Milady tells her she should look her best when D'Artagnan arrives, then throws a rosary around Constance's neck and draws it tight.As D'Artagnan finishes dispatching his enemies, Milady leaves Constance's room and attempts to make her escape but is caught by Athos before she can reach her carriage. D'Artagnan bursts into Constance's room to find her strangled body on the floor. He leaves in profound grief and comes upon Rochefort; assuming him the killer, he charges his arch enemy, attacking violently and taking out his anger and misery on him. Again, they are equally matched swordsmen. Aramis and Porthos see them dueling, but Aramis prevents his partner from interfering; it is D'Artagnan's fight alone.By the time the fighting reaches the church, both men have exhausted each other and neither will yield. Rochefort injures D'Artagnan's hand and deals a blow which takes the point off his sword. Desperate, D'Artagnan makes a final lunge and drives his sword home, pinning the spy to the lectern before he falls and dies, and the young musketeer collapses from exhaustion.Later the musketeers gather with their prisoner at a riverbank, standing in judgment of Milady's crimes. They decide the punishment should be death. Athos uses his privileges as a nobleman to hire a headsman and order the execution at the cost of five pistoles. She defiantly demands a trial by a proper court and, when nobody speaks up, she turns to D'Artagnan for help. When he steps forward Athos tells him, in no uncertain terms, that if he moves further the two of them will cross swords and Athos will kill him, so he resumes his place. They watch as the headsman takes Milady in a boat to a small jut of land on the other side of the lake and does his duty; when he returns they grant his request to be paid two pistoles extra for oarsman duties.The musketeers are then rounded up and D'Artagnan finds himself in Cardinal Richelieu's office again. Richelieu reminds him that he refused an offer of friendship and now stands accused of a serious crime. D'Artagnan then produces the Cardinal's own document granting the bearer the privilege to do ""what has been done."" Knowing he has been defeated, the Cardinal casually burns the note and offers his foe a commission as a lieutenant in the musketeers with the name left blank, saying he and his friends are free to go. Perplexed, D'Artagnan leaves and offers the document to all three of his friends, who politely refuse. He worries that as an officer he will lose his friends, but Porthos assures him that they will always remain ""All for one and one for all."""

Chris quickly follows Wayne out the apartment window, clothes in hand, and the brothers run across town, stopping only for Chris to dress. Upon discovering their car has been towed, they walk through the night to an impound yard and spend most of their money to collect the vehicle.Back on the road, the brothers stop at a diner, but when two redneck police officers come in to eat, Wayne escapes through the bathroom window. After Chris pays for his meal, he jumps in the car and the brothers race off, stiffing the waitress for Wayne's bill. Although the police give chase, Wayne has rigged their vehicles with a chain and the officers are left immobilized.Further along the highway, the brothers pick up 20-year-old Jenny Scott (Cheryl Waters), who is hitchhiking in a ball gown. Chris tells Jenny that he was accused of assault with a deadly weapon, but the judge offered him a choice between jail and military service. When Chris selected the armed forces, Wayne re-enlisted so they could remain together.

With few job skills except that as a singer, Alice, along with her precocious 11-year-old son Tommy, decides to move from their current home in Socorro, New Mexico to her hometown of Monterey, California, the only place she has ever felt happy. She plans on getting singing gigs along the way to earn money to get back to Monterey by the end of the summer and the start of Tommy's school year. Alice's quest for a job at each stop leaves Tommy often to fend for himself. His behavior is fostered by Alice, as their relationship is often more as trouble-making friends than mother and son. Alice's plans often do not end up as she envisions, especially as she is forced to take a waitressing job at Mel and Ruby's Diner in Tucson, Arizona, which entails working with a disparate group, including Mel, the establishment's gruff owner/short-order cook, and her fellow waitresses, the wisecracking, foul-mouthed Flo, and the naive and shy Vera.

Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) by Robert Getchell is a Romantic Drama about a recently widowed and bullied housewife Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn), who leaves New Mexico in a station wagon with her spoiled and mouthy, twelve-year-old son, Tommy (Alfred Lutter III), to start life anew in Monterey, California, her childhood home. Alice wants to earn money as a singer, and thinks that Monterey is where she and Tommy will find happiness, but, after a short-lived gig and a psychotic boyfriend, which she first experiences on the road, she escapes, only to get as far as Tucson. It's here that she finds work as a waitress in Mel and Ruby's chaotic little diner along with new friends and a rugged and handsome cowboy, David, who all convince her to stay in Tucson. And Tommy doesn't mind either. Throughout this film, Alice struggles to be a single mom to the consistently ill-mannered and disrespectful Tommy, while also trying to find a loving man that she can stand up to. As it turns out, David lashes out at the much-deserving brat, Tommy, and challenges Alice to be a better mom and a stronger woman. Though the dramatic showdown between Alice and David in the diner is meant to convince us that Alice has finally grown a spine, it was more of a show of Alice ""trying"" to be tough, but not actually feeling it, especially because up until this point, she is mostly ineffectual. Everything she and Tommy says and does seems to be more of a repeat of their same bad behavior, rather than any progressive improvements. Another road stop for Alice and Tommy, in between Phoenix and Tucson, would have been a good opportunity to show Alice having a little bit of success with a man and Tommy, to show that she is learning from her mistakes.—T.B.

However, Burns will stop at nothing to keep Johnson at the Enquirer.—grantss Hildy Johnson is the top reporter on a Chicago newspaper during the 1920s.

Upstairs, reporters play poker in the press room. Newspaper editor Walter Burns (Walter Matthau) calls from the Chicago Examiner, looking for reporter Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson (Jack Lemmon) to put him on the story, but he's not there. Walter leaves word that Hildy should immediately come to his office.Later, Hildy wanders into Walter's office at a leisurely pace and informs the editor that he's in love. Walter tells Hildy he wants him to cover the hanging the next morning and snap an illegal picture of the hanged man with a hidden camera. Minutes after the execution, an ambulance will be waiting for Hildy outside so that he can type his story in the back and beat the other newspapers to press with a morning extra.

As Mollie leaves, Hildy shows up with drinks to celebrate his new advertising job. Just then, the sheriff (Vincent Gardenia) visits the press room to hand out tickets to the hanging. Hildy accuses the sheriff and mayor of reprieving Williams twice so that the hanging would take place just before an election.

Hildy disagrees, claiming that Williams is ""just a screwball.""At the jailhouse, Williams (Austin Pendleton), a diminutive, soft-spoken man, is escorted to the sheriff's office for his final psychological examination.

The Mayor then sends orders, via the sheriff, for the police to ""shoot to kill,"" now that Williams is in their sights.Headed for a night train to Philadelphia, Hildy joins Peggy in a taxi outside the courthouse. However, when he realizes he left the wedding rings, he runs back inside. There, Hildy finds the rings moments before Williams falls through a window and points a gun at him. Hildy reminds Williams that he conducted an interview with the convict at his jail cell a few days ago. Williams then passes out, and Hildy drags him to the bathroom, draws the curtains, and calls Walter to tell him that he has Williams in his custody. Mollie shows up, and Williams emerges at the sound of her voice. Hildy sends Peggy to pick up their luggage while he finishes up some last-minute business.Hildy hides Williams inside a roll-top desk when the other reporters demand entry to the press room. The men suspect Hildy is hiding something. To cover for Hildy, Mollie claims to know where Williams is, then jumps out the window. The reporters run outside to see if she's still alive. As the room clears, Walter appears at the door. He orders a delivery truck and six large men to move the desk, with Williams inside, to the Chicago Examiner office. Hildy types up a story while Walter takes Williams' picture and sends Keppler to develop the negative.Just then, Peggy returns to find Hildy typing away with Walter at his side. Distracted, Hildy suggests Peggy go to the train station ahead of him, and she leaves, dejected. When he finishes the story, Hildy becomes frustrated with Walter's persistence and heads off to the train station. Before he can leave, however, the sheriff shows up with the other reporters, all of whom accuse Hildy of hiding something. A policeman holds Hildy, while the sheriff demands Williams' whereabouts. The sheriff finally realizes Williams is inside the desk. Police escort Williams away, and the sheriff arrests Hildy and Walter for hiding the convict.In a jail cell, Hildy blames Walter for keeping him from Peggy. In a neighboring cell, Plunkett, who has been arrested for drunkenness, overhears Walter and informs him that he has Williams' reprieve. The Mayor arrives at the jail, and Walter presents him with the reprieve, accusing him of ignoring it so that he could hang Williams before the election. The Mayor lets Walter and Hildy out, and Walter arranges for Hildy to be rushed to the train station to meet Peggy. Just before the train pulls away, Walter gives Hildy his pocket watch as a gift for service to his newspaper. After the train pulls out of the station, Walter (crafty and evil to the end) arranges for Hildy to be arrested at the next stop for stealing his watch!The film closes with a series of texts that say that some time later, Hildy returned to the Chicago Examiner to become Managing Editor. Walter retired, lecturing from time to time at the University of Chicago on the ethics of journalism. Williams, now freed, got married to Mollie, and the two run a health-food store together."
A Woman Under the Influence,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072417/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Although wife and mother Mabel is loved by her husband Nick, her mental illness places a strain on the marriage.

He fights to keep a semblance of normality in the face of her bizarre behavior, but when her actions affect their children, he has her committed.—BA Jacobson <pcfe2151@cybercom.net> The Longhettis are a working class family, Nick who heads a city works crew, and Mabel who stays at home looking after their three adolescent children, Angelo, Tony and Maria. Many people who look at the family from the outside believe Mabel is crazy, her behavior which Mabel largely attributes to her exuberance in trying to be who she thinks Nick wants her to be to put their family in a good light in whatever social situation. Nick too knows the perception others have of Mabel, he who tries to do whatever he needs to to protect her. An incident involving Mabel may cross that line for Nick of what he believes he can handle on his own, versus needing the assistance of medical professionals, all in protecting the children and Mabel from herself, but equally what he believes is the good Longhetti name. Nick's collective actions in dealing with Mabel before, during and after this specific incident demonstrate how emotionally capable Nick is in his own right.—Huggo On the verge of falling apart, Mabel Longhetti, a warm, spontaneous, beautiful Los Angeles housewife and inconsistent mother-of-three, tries too hard to be the perfect wife, a perfect mother, and the perfect lover. But, little by little, crushed under the weight of the fruitless pursuit of happiness, vulnerable Mabel sinks into depression. And, more and more, as her concerned construction foreman husband, Nick, becomes convinced that Mabel's increasingly erratic and volatile behaviour poses a threat to their family, institutionalisation seems like the only solution. Indeed, love and life can be painful. Can Mabel prepare herself for a daunting fresh start and a new chapter in her life?—Nick Riganas"

Lenny,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071746/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of acerbic 1960s comicLenny Bruce, whose groundbreaking, no-holds-barred style and social commentary was often deemed by the Establishment as too obscene for the public. Interview-style biography of controversial and pioneering stand-up comedian Lenny Bruce. The film traces Bruce from his beginnings as a Catskills comic to his later underground popularity based on his anti-establishment politics and his scatological humor.—Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> In an interview, Honey Harlow Bruce (Valerie Perrine), ex-wife of stand-up comic Lenny Bruce (Dustin Hoffman), recalls her life with him:In 1964, Lenny shocks his audience by stating that Eleanor Roosevelt gave Lou Gehrig ""the clap,"" but then says the real point he wants to make is about the suppression of words. Venereal disease he says, is an epidemic because people will not talk about it.Honey then recalls seeing Lenny for the first time in Baltimore, when he was a comic impersonator:In the early 1950s, Honey, a stripper known as Hot Honey Harlow, is eating in a cafeteria when she sees Lenny watching her from across the room. The next time Lenny and Honey see each other, they go off together to have sex. Afterward, the smitten Lenny calls Honey his ""shiksa goddess"" and follows her to Miami.In another interview, Artie Silver (Stanley Beck), Lenny's manager, discusses the delicate balance of involving himself in both Lenny's professional and personal life:Shortly after Lenny and Honey meet, Artie warns Lenny that Honey, who had done jail time as a teenager, would be trouble. Despite Artie's misgivings, Lenny marries Honey, then takes her to meet his mother, Sally Marr (Jan Miner), and her sister Aunt Mema (Rashel Novikoff). Later, Lenny, who is uncomfortable with Honey's stripping, adds her to his act. They are hired to perform in the Catskills, where, during a show, Lenny makes an impulsive, crude joke to the band that is overheard by the audience. After this incidence, Sherman Hart (Gary Morton), an established comic, advises Lenny not to use ""dirt"" in his routines, but, at his next performance, Lenny intentionally insults his audience, thus losing career opportunities.In a 1960s performance, Lenny asks his audience, ""What is dirty?"" He says he would rather his child watch a stag movie than 'The King of Kings' , because nobody gets hurt in porn.In a flashback to 1950s, Honey is seriously injured and, while in the hospital, guesses that Lenny has an affair with her nurse. This incident becomes the source of a routine Lenny performs a decade later, in which Lenny advises men to deny their indiscretions at all costs, even if their wives catch them in the act. Explaining the difference between men and women, Lenny says that a woman is physical with someone she likes, but a man will seek out anything, even on a desert island.In the 1950s, the couple moves to Los Angeles, Honey returns to stripping, Lenny to small gigs and they become involved in the show business drug culture. Lenny pushes to experiment sexually, but then accuses Honey of enjoying the other woman in their ménage a trois ""too much."" In her interview, Honey recalls that after their daughter, Kitty, was born, she and Lenny parted.During his stand-up act in the 1960s, Lenny says that ""divorce is great at first, but then you realize the women you meet are also divorced and burdened with children or poodles"". He claims the only satisfaction is the revenge of gaining child custody, but then you are responsible for getting up in the morning to raise the child.In her interview, Honey at first accuses Lenny of stealing Kitty, but then admits she had a problem with drug abuse:In the late 1950s, Honey, an emotional wreck from loneliness and drugs, calls Lenny collect from Hawaii, where she has been arrested for possession of marijuana.In a 1960s performance, Lenny explains that the problem is that we live in a ""happy ending"" culture instead of a ""what is"" culture. He thinks that true human responses are denied and lied about, causing people to feel guilty when they act in a natural way.In an interview, Sally says that she moved to California to help with Kitty, and that Lenny had by then given up impersonation and begun to improvise:In the late 1950s, Lenny works in strip clubs, content that no one censors his act. Eventually, Artie and Sally convince him to take engagements at college and political venues, where his irreverence soon becomes trendy. During a performance, Lenny risks audience alienation by boldly referring to individuals using racial epithets. Then, explaining that suppression gives words power, he advocates using offensive words until they can no longer cause pain. When a Time magazine reporter suggests that Lenny's act has social impact, Lenny denies it, saying he likes attention and wants to ""make a buck."" Now, Artie commands high fees for Lenny's appearances.During one performance, Lenny says that he has been accused of making ""sick jokes,"" but that a true sick joke is that Zsa Zsa Gabor earns $60,000 a week in Las Vegas and a Nevada school teacher's top pay is $6,000 a year. After wisecracking about masturbation and integration, Lenny says his financial success is based on violence, segregation, disease, despair and injustice, and if the world suddenly became pure, he would be unemployed. When he visits Honey in prison, he shows her an album cover of a recording of some of his performances.At an appearance in San Francisco, Lenny protests the dismissal of homosexual teachers, saying the men were considered good at their jobs and their actions occurred far from school grounds. Because of one of his crudely worded comments, Lenny is arrested and charged with the use of an obscene word in a public place.During his interview, Artie recalls that Lenny became obsessed with his legal battles and would read court transcripts to his audience:At Lenny's trial without jury in San Francisco, the judge orders a continuance and cautions Lenny not to repeat any of ""those words.""At Lenny's next performance, after pointing out to the audience several uniformed and plainclothes policemen posted around the room, Lenny talks about his arrest, substituting the sounds, ""blah blah blah,"" for provocative words. When the trial resumes, the humorless judge finds Lenny guilty, after which his counsel requests a jury trial.In his interview, Artie states that Lenny began to study law books and record his trials:During the appeal trial, his lawyer forces the arresting policeman to admit that one of the words that Lenny is being charged for saying in public is often used at the police station, which also is a public place. Then his lawyer suggests that Lenny's work is found in the social satire of Aristophanes and Jonathan Swift. A professor of religion testifies that Lenny's routines convey a sincere message that exposes hypocrisy. A recording of a performance is played, one in which Lenny riffs on the phrase, ""to come,"" and arranges his words into a kind of beat poem. Although the judge is offended, the jury votes for acquittal. Lenny, however, is dissatisfied, feeling that he won because of the jury's idiosyncrasies rather than the acknowledgment of First Amendment rights.According to Artie's later recollection, Lenny, who added jokes about the Pope and other religious leaders to his routines, developed a following, although some people attended shows just to see if he got arrested. After Honey is released from prison, she and Lenny spend time together taking drugs. Artie and Sally try to cancel Lenny's Chicago performance, but when the manager refuses, the drug-addled, coughing Lenny goes onstage. After an attempt at coherence, he apologizes, admitting he is not funny. Backstage, the police arrest him.In the present, Honey recalls that Lenny was arrested a total of 13 times, and Sally states that he suffered from pleurisy. Artie says Lenny dealt with depression, and was going broke from lawyer and doctor bills. In a performance at the height of his career, Lenny tells the audience that there has been an ""obscenity circus"" for years, starring the district attorney and the lower and Supreme Courts, and that he is the ""schmuck"" who fell off the high wire into the ring. As he wonders aloud why it is permissible to show photographs of maimed breasts injured in war, but not the beautiful breasts of a lovely woman in the audience, a policeman rises to arrest him.At the trial, words Lenny has spoken are presented out of context and a gesture he used is incorrectly stated to signify masturbation. Increasingly frustrated, Lenny speaks out, asking to talk to the judge and jury as human to human, but his interruptions anger the judge. Expecting a guilty verdict, his defense team plans to appeal to a higher court, but Lenny, no longer thinking clearly, is uncooperative. He tries defending himself, but the judge declares him in contempt of court. Lenny states that he has no money left and his cabaret card, which allows him to perform, has been confiscated. As he is removed from the courtroom, Lenny claims he hurts no one and pleads that they do not take away his words.In her interview, Sally says the New York court found Lenny guilty, but an appeal was being planned by his defense team. When the interviewer suggests the possibility of suicide, Sally denies it. Honey describes Lenny as funny, and Artie, pleased that Lenny's records are selling again, states that he is negotiating a film about his life. Intrigued, the interviewer mentions that Lenny's speeches are now-after less than a decade-considered harmless.Back in 1966, when Lenny is found dead in his apartment, naked, with drug paraphernalia nearby, the police allow news photographers to film his death scene."
The Sugarland Express,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072226/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman attempts to reunite her family by helping her husband escape prison and together kidnapping their son. But things don't go as planned when they are forced to take a police hostage on the road. Lou-Jean, a blonde woman, tells her husband, who is imprisoned, to escape. They plan to kidnap their own child, who was placed with foster parents. The escape is partly successful, they take a hostage, who is a policeman and are pursued through to Texas...—Kornel Osvart <kornelo@alphanet.hu> When faced with the loss of her infant son, Lou-Jean Poplin makes her husband, Clovis, escape from a minimum security prison. Threatened with capture, the couple take rookie Texas State trooper Maxwell Slide hostage, and head across the state in his patrol car. Pursued by dozens of police cars, the trio contend with their sudden elevation to folk heroes, and vigilantes out to stop them. Their only real friend may be trooper Captain Tanner, who struggles to find a peaceful end to the situation.—Kevin L. In Texas, Lou Jean Poplin has just completed an eight-month sentence for petty crimes committed. Her husband, Clovis Poplin, is in minimum security pre-release remand, where he is serving the remaining four months of a one-year sentence, also for petty crimes committed. Albeit by threatening means, Lou Jean convinces Clovis to break out of remand. The reason?--child welfare services have awarded permanent custody of their infant son Langston to his foster parents who live in Sugarland, Texas. Lou Jean vows to get Langston back by whatever means, and she needs Clovis' help. Early on in Clovis' escape, they take highway patrolman Matthew Slide hostage in his patrol car, who is to drive them to Sugarland. Captain Harlin Tanner, who is leading the pursuit of the Poplins, sees that the Poplins are basically decent but misguided kids who in their current mission have committed some serious crimes, all which he takes into account when deciding on the appropriate course of action to end the pursuit while trying to protect Slide. But the case takes on a life of its own when the story hits the airwaves, with every Texan having his or her own very strong opinion on the Poplins, what they are doing and how best to help or hinder their mission.—Huggo The real incident took place in May of 1969. This one is about February of 1973, just west of Houston, Texas (Sugarland in actuality), Clovis Poplin is serving the remainder of his one year prison sentence in pre-release at the TDC Pre-Release Facility for petty larceny. His wife Lou Jean is also newly released from prison and comes to visit him with the intention of breaking him out because she just lost their child to foster parents that intend to adopt Baby Langston. She threatens to leave him for good if he does not go along with her plan. Clovis and Lou Jean are uneducated and not playing with a full deck; Clovis is naïve and easily manipulated and Lou Jean is beautiful, but annoying, ignorant, impulsive, and borderline sociopathic.Lou Jean is wearing Clovis' clothes underneath hers and they very easily sneak out of the facility, posing as visiting friends of Clovis' fellow prison mate, Hubie Nocker. They hitch a ride out with his parents, with his father driving on the freeway less than 25 miles an hour. A young patrol officer by the name of Maxwell Slide stops him and gives him a warning citation. Fearing that the young officer will spot them, Clovis and Lou Jean steal the elderly couple's 1956 Buick Roadmaster skidding and speeding over the Brazos River and through the town of Richmond, wrecking the car near a slough. Lou Jean pretends to be badly injured, and Patrolman Slide is kidnapped at gunpoint. Because Slide is new and inexperienced to the force, they seem to have little problem with his cooperation.Veteran police Captain Tanner is in the middle of a court hearing in Houston and the hearing immediately adjourned until later so he can get to the kidnapping. Tanner is a mannered and genteel soul who seems sympathetic to the Poplin's and Slide's dilemma, but realizes with his job he needs to stick to his principles and do the right thing.During the trip across Alternate Highway 90 and Interstate 10, the local radio station reveals Clovis to be a native of Crowley, a small town just south of Fort Worth and Lou Jean as an unemployed beautician from Sayers, a town just east of San Antonio. The Poplin's stop at a porta potty in the road so Lou Jean can relieve herself, an Exxon Humble filling station with cop cars escorting them, an Arco filling station taking a load of gold stamps, two Louisiana state troopers join in and participate, stop at a chicken stand in Pleasanton, then take Loop 1604. At a Fina gas station in Converse, Slide zooms his police car to escape the convoy of police cars so they can rest for the night.Clovis, Lou Jean, and Officer Slide hide out for the night at a used car lot near the old Loop 13 Drive In Movie Theater on Military Drive, with Slide handcuffed to the backseat of the police car and Clovis and Lou Jean staying in an RV. Captain Tanner and half the state police force are using the Harlandale ISD football stadium for the night.Captain Tanner has summoned Lou Jean's father from his home in Sayers by helicopter to make a statement to her via police radio to persuade her to turn herself in. He's an elderly man, courteous to the police officers, but just as ignorant and uneducated as Lou Jean and states on the radio that she's no good, would shoot her and Clovis if he had a chance, and that God will get her. Lou Jean does not hear this, but Slide hears it on the police radio in the car just before she comes to check on him. He assures her that he knows she's really a good person inside and comes to realize her upbringing was not a pleasant one.The next morning, an unidentified trio of leftist lunatics leave their home with intent to find Lou Jean and Clovis. They spot them at the used car lot and, acting no better than their upbringing taught them, shoot at the car's helpless occupants repeatedly. The police get wind of the incident and arrest the men, who are not the National Guard they claim to be. Tanner assures Clovis and Lou Jean that they will be left alone. But Tanner realizes he still needs to do his job. He asks the couple and baby to hide in a downtown shelter and enlists two sharpshooters to their home to kill the couple.Down the trip on Highway 90 from San Antonio to Sugarland (Del Rio in reality of this movie, except the filming location of the home and downtown was actually Floresville), Tanner dodges media, the trio in the police car are welcomed and supported by a large crowd in the fictional town of Rodrigo (probably Hondo), and they make it to the house.Clovis does not want to get out of the car and fears it's a trap, but Lou Jean pushes him to do it. Clovis is shot in the chest. The three of them drive to the Rio Grande river to cross the border, but Clovis dies at the wheel right before he can escape.After Clovis dies, Lou Jean is arrested and Officer Slide consoled by Captain Tanner for his bravery and a job well done. Lou Jean served 15 months of a 5 year prison sentence and was awarded custody by the state after getting out on parole."

He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say ""He'd kill us if he had the chance."" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention party. Among the partygoers is Meredith (Elizabeth McRae), a showgirl who worked at Moran's convention booth. Meredith openly flirts with Caul and in a private moment, Caul opens up to her about his troubles with Amy. This conversation is recorded by Moran, who had earlier planted a bug on Caul. Caul is outraged and kicks everybody out. Meredith stays, helps Caul into bed, undresses herself and sleeps with him. Caul has a dream in which he pursues Ann through the fog, telling her about how he nearly died as a child. In this dream, he warns Ann that the Director plans to kill her. ""I'm not afraid of death,"" he tells her as she disappears into the mist, ""but I am afraid of murder.""When Caul awakens in the morning, he discovers both Meredith and the tapes are gone. Frustrated and angry, he returns home and tries to call the Director. Caul has lied to many people that he doesn't have a home telephone and is surprised when Martin calls him back at home. Martin tells him that he took the tapes and delivered them to the Director. Caul should come to the office to pick up his fee ($15,000). Caul does as asked, and finds the seething Director (Robert Duvall) listening to the conversation. The Director curtly dismisses Caul after paying him.Disturbed, Caul goes to the hotel that Ann and Marc mentioned as meeting place in their conversation. He rents an adjoining room and inserts a microphone through the wall to listen to the conversation. He hears shouting. Rushing to the balcony, he sees bloody hand prints on the glass partition. Appalled and frightened, he collapses in his own room. Upon reviving, he breaks into the room Marc and Ann had rented. The room seems orderly, but the toilet is running. He gives it a flush and blood wells out.Caul goes to see the Director but security blocks his way. On the street, he is surprised to see Ann sitting in an idling car. A newspaper headline informs him that the Director has been killed in a car accident. Ann now controls the Director's company. Later, as Ann, Marc and Martin try to escape reporters asking them about an inquiry into the Director's death, they notice Caul watching them. Caul realizes that the bloody hand he saw in the hotel was the Director's; Marc's statement that the Director would kill them if he had the chance was a rationalization of their decision to kill him.Back in his apartment, Caul sits alone, playing his saxophone to his favorite jazz records. His phone rings. When he answers, no one is there. He hangs up and resumes playing. It rings again; this time, Martin tells him that Ann and Marc know he has deduced what happened, and that they will be listening to him. Martin then plays back a recording of Caul's saxophone playing. Completely consumed by paranoia and forgetful of Moran's demonstration at the convention, Caul demolishes his apartment looking for the bug. Unable to find it, he resumes playing his saxophone."
Black Christmas,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071222/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During their Christmas break, a group of sorority girls are stalked by a stranger. It's time for Christmas break, and the sorority sisters make plans for the holiday, but the strange anonymous phone calls are beginning to put them on edge. When Clare disappears, they contact the police, who don't express much concern. Meanwhile Jess is planning to get an abortion, but boyfriend Peter is very much against it. The police finally begin to get concerned when a 13-year-old girl is found dead in the park. They set up a wiretap to the sorority house, but will they be in time to prevent a sorority girl attrition problem?—Ed Sutton <esutton@mindspring.com> On the evening that the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority (which is headed by their house mother, the booze swilling Mrs. Mac) is holding their Christmas party, the house receives the latest in a string of obscene phone calls from who the girls call ""the moaner"", but who identifies himself as ""Billy"". Some like Jess Bradford don't like the calls, others like brash Barb Coard are somewhat amused by the calls, others like Phyl Carlson don't think much of them, and straight laced Clare Harrison is offended by them. The calls are just the latest trouble for Jess, who is pregnant and who doesn't want to tell her sensitive but volatile boyfriend, music student Peter Smythe. For this latest call, which is a bit more elaborate than those previous, Barb decides to make a snide comment in return, which provokes a threat by Billy. The next morning, one of the girls goes missing. The desk sergeant at the police station doesn't think much about this as a missing person case, especially as the police are already dealing with another missing person case (a thirteen year old girl named Janice Quaife). The police don't act until more information is brought to the attention of Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller by Clare's boyfriend, Chris Hayden. As Lt. Fuller and his men investigate, which includes placing a wire tap on the sorority house phones, more and more incidents happen to those living at the sorority house. In addition, the obscene calls continue and increasingly have a personal connotation to one of the girls, which includes information that could only be known by those involved. Or is there another reason why the caller knows so much about the specific girl in question?—Huggo Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star among an ill-fated houseful of sorority sisters celebrating the holiday season. Festivities turn fatal when obscene phone calls break the serenity and it becomes clear that a psychopath is stalking the house.—Clint Weiler The film opens at night on a snow-covered college campus. There is a Christmas party underway in one of the sorority houses, a large converted mansion. The sorority sisters and many of their boyfriends are inside. Outside in the snow, a point-of-view shot illustrates someone looking into the windows. The person breathes heavily and seems to be a man, but this is all we can tell. The person prowls around before climbing a rose trellis and entering the house through an attic window. He then climbs down through the attic trap door and lurks in the upstairs of the house, watching the girls downstairs.One of the sorority sisters, Barb Coard (Margot Kidder), receives a phone call from her mother. Barb seems to have been planning on going home over the Christmas holiday, but her mother has made plans to go away with her latest boyfriend. Barb calls her mother a gold-plated whore and says she'll make other plans for the break. She asks fellow sorority sisters Phyllis Carlson (Andrea Martin) and Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) to go skiing with her instead. Jess also gets a phone call from her boyfriend, Peter (Kier Dullea), an aspiring concert pianist. She seems tense and wants to talk to Peter about something important. She says she'll see him tomorrow at the rehearsal studio. After their boyfriends leave, the girls get another phone call; Jess answers the phone and announces to all the other girls that its ""The Moaner"". Together they listen to the bizarre phone call, which starts out with simply heavy breathing and then
escalates into strange ranting and obscene language. Barb gets on the receiver and bawls out the caller, firing back with her own obscene comments, until the caller suddenly lowers his voice and says ""I'm going to kill you."" He then hangs up.A sorority sister named Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) seems more timid than the others. She questions Barb's judgment in provoking an unstable individual, and reminds her that a girl from town was raped recently by an unknown assailant. Barb reacts angrily and upsets Clare, who then goes upstairs to pack; her father is picking her up the next day to take her home for Christmas. Clare finds Claude, the house mother's cat, in her room, even though the door is closed. She is unaware the killer is watching her from within her closet. In a morbid twist, the psychopath meows like Claude and lures Clare into the closet, where he lunges at her and wraps plastic cleaning bags around her head, smothering her to death. He then carries her body up into the attic and places it in a rocking chair by the window, the plastic bag still over her head. He places a doll in her lap and refers to her as Agnes.Downstairs, the other girls are oblivious to Clare's death, and they welcome in the house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman), who seems to have just returned from shopping. They present her with a Christmas gift: a frilly nightgown. She pretends to like it but makes sarcastic remarks about it (and the girls themselves) while she is alone. Mrs. Mac goes to the library and seeks a book--""B for Booze!""--and hidden inside of it is a bottle of brandy, from which she takes a secret drink. She later fishes a bottle out of the toilet tank in her bathroom, as well, and rinses her mouth with booze after brushing her teeth.The next day, Clare's father (James Edmond) comes to collect her, but she is not at the appointed place. When he seeks her at the sorority house, he is shocked by the sexually suggestive posters he finds in her room, and also surprised that she has a boy's photo next to her bed (her boyfriend, Chris). Mr. Harrison seems to blame Mrs. Mac for the permissive attitude in the house. Mrs. Mac assures him that Clare is a good girl, and that she's probably just at one of the fraternity houses visiting Chris. Mr. Harrison offers to drop Mrs. Mac off at the store on his way there. Before they leave, Mrs. Mac hears Claude meowing but cannot find him; he is in the attic.Jess visits Peter while he is practicing for a very important audition, and she breaks some news to him: she is unexpectedly pregnant. Peter thinks it's good news, but Jess admits that she wasnt even going to tell Peter about it. Jess intends to get an abortion. Peter is adamantly opposed to this, and makes an ominous threat against Jess for even considering such a thing.Barb is at the fraternity house with Phyl's boyfriend, who is dressed like Santa and taking photos with small children. Barb has a bottle of wine and is getting drunk, and she gives one of the children sips of her alcohol. Mr. Harrison phones home and assures his wife that they will find Clare.Back at the sorority house, Jess receives another obscene phone call. This one is more elaborate; the killer speaks in several different voices and makes references to ""Agnes"" and ""Billy"". He also seems to be speaking in the voices of two adults, presumably the parents of Agnes and Billy. The voices even seem to overlap at times, adding to the unsettling effect. Jess is upset, especially after her confrontation with Peter.Phyl and Barb take Mr. Harrison to the police station to report Clare missing. The officer on duty at the desk, Sgt. Nash (Douglas McGrath), endures hostility from Barb about the incident. Sgt. Nash tells Mr. Harrison that hes sure Clare is just somewhere with Chris. Sgt. Nash asks Barb for the phone number at the sorority house, and she tells him its Fellatio-20880. ""It's a new exchange, FE"" she explains. Nash, who apparently does not know the meaning of the word fellatio, writes it down and thanks her.Back at the sorority house, Mrs. Mac tells Jess that Clare is missing, so Jess goes to see Chris while he is at hockey practice. Chris is furious when Jess tells him that the police are not taking it seriously because they think she's shacked up somewhere with him.Peter performs his audition and fails miserably, distraught about the news Jess has given him. The instructors who listen to the recital are shocked that he cannot seem to hit the right notes, and later he destroys the piano after they've gone.Chris and Jess appear at the police station and Chris angrily lashes out at Sgt. Nash for having a big mouth (meaning his suggestion that Clare was shacked up with him). Lt. Fuller (John Saxon) overhears and becomes interested in the case--he has already been taking another missing person report from a distraught mother named Mrs. Quaife, whose 13-year-old daughter Janice has suddenly disappeared while on her way home from school.Mr. Harrison has dinner with Phyl, Barb, and Mrs. Mac at the sorority house, but Barb is extremely drunk and launches into a vulgar tirade that ends with her lashing out at the others. Barb feels guilty because she was careless to Clare, and she says the others think her disappearance is Barb's fault. Barb's curt suggestion that Clare might be dead shocks Mr. Harrison, and Phyl reacts angrily, telling Barb to go to bed. Barb goes upstairs and leaves them alone. Meanwhile, Jess and Chris come back to the house and tell the others about Janice Quaife's disappearance. A search is underway, and Phyl and Mr. Harrison join them. Mrs. Mac tells them that she's leaving for her sisters house and may not be there when they return. When Jess leaves, Mrs. Mac packs her bags and calls a cab, but she is distracted by sounds from the attic: the killer lures her into the attic by making sounds like the cat. When Mrs. Mac opens the attic door, he swings a large hook at her, designed to pull things up into the attic crawlspace. The hook impales her under her chin and hangs her. Outside, the cabbie becomes impatient and leaves.The extensive search of the park turns up a body: Janice Quaife. Jess rushes back to the house, where she receives another frightening phone call from the killer. Again he uses multiple voices and reenacts some weird scenario involving naughty Billy and baby Agnes. This time, Jess calls the police to report the obscene phone calls. As she talks to Sgt. Nash, a figure approaches her from behind and startles her--it is Peter, who has been napping in the house while waiting for Jess to return. Nash does not take Jess's report seriously, although Mr. Harrison is sitting near him in the police station and overhears him talking to Jess about the calls. He and Phyl and Chris tell Lt. Fuller about it, and Lt. Fuller angrily scolds Nash for being so inept.Meanwhile, Peter proposes to Jess. He would like to quit the conservatory and marry Jess and be a father to her child. Jess, however, refuses. She does not want to get married or have a child yet, as she has things she wants to accomplish first. Peter becomes hurt and angry, telling Jess that she's talking about killing their baby as if it's like having a wart removed. Jess becomes frightened by his mounting hostility, and tells Peter to leave.Just as Peter is walking out, Phyl arrives with Lt. Fuller and a phone company rep named Graham, who puts a tap on the house phone. Fuller notices that Peter seemed angry, and he questions Jess about it. He also looks around Clare's room and asks more questions about her. Graham asks if there is another phone in the house and Fuller tells him that it is a private line belonging to Mrs. Mac and that there have been no obscene phone calls on it, so they don't tap it. Fuller tells Jess that he'll be listening in on all of her phone conversations from the station, and Graham tells her to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible so that he can trace the call. Fuller has also left an officer in a squad car outside to watch the house.When he leaves, Phyl begins crying and tells Jess that she's sure Clare is dead. Tired and emotionally exhausted, she goes to bed, and Jess waits for another phone call. Meanwhile, the killer goes into Barb's room and watches her sleeping. Barb, who has asthma, suddenly suffers an attack, and Jess rushes to her aid with an inhaler. Barb tells her that she had a nightmare about a stranger coming into her room. Barb goes back to sleep, and Jess is distracted by a group of Christmas carolers at the front door. The singing masks the sounds of Barb's murder; the killer returns and stabs her to death using a glass ornament near her bed.The carolers are suddenly rushed off by a concerned parent who has just found out about the murder of the little girl in the park. Jess hears the phone ringing, and it's the killer. He wails at her in a strange voice, and says ""It's just like having a wart removed!"" before hanging up. Jess is shocked; these are words she used in private to Peter. Lt. Fuller picks up on this but Jess denies that it has any significance. Phyl comes back downstairs and Jess tells her about what just happened; Phyl seems to not think the killer could possibly be Peter, and neither does Jess, but she is not sure. Peter himself calls then, and begs Jess not to kill the baby. This conversation doesn't last long enough to trace, either, but Fuller calls to ask Jess about what they were talking about. Jess admits she's pregnant, and that Peter objects to an abortion, and Fuller seems to think that Peter could be the caller after all. Jess, however, has a revelation: Peter was here at the house with her when one of the calls came through, so it couldnt be Peter calling. Fuller is still suspicious, and he requests Peters records from the Dean of Admissions. He goes to the conservatory and finds the piano violently smashed.Jess is convinced that she can now rule out Peter as a suspect, and both she and Phyl are relieved. They have a brief laugh after they are startled by two bumbling men from town who are out looking for the killer. Phyl and Jess go around the house locking all the doors and windows, when Phyl goes into Barb's room. Just inside the door, someone whispers ""Agnes!"" and the door slams shut. Jess tries to find Phyl but the phone rings; its the killer again. This time Jess keeps him on the phone long enough for Graham to trace the calls--they are coming from 6 Belmont Street, the same address as the sorority house itself. Nash radios Fuller with the news, and Fuller realizes the calls are coming from the house mother's phone. He tries to radio the policeman parked outside the sorority house, but the cop is now dead, his throat slit by the killer. Fuller radios Nash and tells him to call Jess and warn her to get out of there, without letting on that the killer is in the house with her. Nash, of course, is unable to do this; when Jess tells him she's going to go upstairs and get Phyl and Barb, Nash admits that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house itself.Jess is terrified, and she screams out for Phyl and Barb over and over again. The house is silent. Instead of leaving, Jess gets a poker from the fireplace and goes upstairs. In Barb's room, she finds the bodies of both Phyl and Barb on the bed. From the crack in the door, Jess sees the killer's eye watching her. ""Agnes, its me, Billy! Don't tell what we did!"" he whispers. Jess slams the door on him and runs. Howling in rage and pain, the killer chases after her. With no time to unlock the front door, Jess heads for the cellar. The killer catches her hair as she passes the stairs, but Jess is able to break free and bolt the cellar door behind her just in time. Eventually the maniac stops pounding on the door, and Jess hears sounds as if he is going out the front door. Unsure, she remains in the cellar. Through the basement windows, Jess can see someone prowling around the house. Unable to gain admittance, the figure seems to spot Jess in the cellar; it is Peter. He calls out to her but Jess ignores him. Peter breaks a window and enters the basement with her. ""Whats the matter, Jess?"" he asks, as she approaches her. He will not be dissuaded.Outside, Fuller arrives with other policemen close behind, and they find the patrolman dead in his car. Hearing Jess screaming from inside the house, they break in. By the time they reach the basement, they find Jess and Peter lying together; they appear to both be dead, but Jess stirs. She has killed Peter with the fire poker.A doctor gives Jess a sedative and she is sleeping, although the house is bustling with activity. Fuller, unable to question her, hypothesizes about the case, convinced that Peter was the killer. Mr. Harrison suddenly goes into shock. The doctor intervenes and wants to take Mr. Harrison to the hospital. Chris leaves with them, and so do the other police officers, leaving Jess alone and unconscious with a guard in front of the house. After they leave, the house is silent, and the attic door opens. The bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac are still up there, unnoticed by anybody yet. The killer climbs down out of the attic, saying ""Agnes, its me, Billy!"" As the camera slowly pulls away from the house, we see the lone police officer on the front porch, smoking a cigarette. Suddenly the phone begins to ring, just as it did after all the murders that came before."
Claudine,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071334/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the 1970s Harlem, garbage collector Roop feels intimidated by the idea of dating Claudine who is a single mother of six on welfare. ""How can frightened people change anything?"" Claudine (1974) by Tina and Lester Pine is touted as a ""heart and soul comedy"" about a struggling, single mother of six feisty children, who takes a rare leap of faith to date a smooth and amorous garbage man. Claudine Price (Diahann Carroll) thinks she found herself a prince of a man in Rupert ""Roop"" Marshall (James Earl Jones)-a hardworking man who seems genuinely interested in her and her defensive kids. He's attentive, affectionate, and persistent with Claudine, and he slowly earns the trust, better behavior, and affection of the children. The romance is steady and strong, and Rupert proposes to a hopeful Claudine, despite his reluctance to deal with the irrational and unhelpful rules of the Social Service department. When Rupert gets a ""willful neglect"" notice along with a wage garnishment for child support, however, he goes into a rage, quits his job, and disappears from Claudine's life on the day the children throw him a Father's Day party. The disbelieving and despondent Claudine and the kids now struggle to adjust to Roop's absence, and Charles, the oldest of the six, goes out to confront a drunk Roop at a bar. Roop is hardly in any state to fight back, so he gives Charles a bear hug and shows up later that night, in front of their apartment building, to say goodbye to everyone. What happens, instead, is a heartwarming exchange where Roop complains that Claudine's family is too much for him to handle financially, and the kids reassure him that they won't be as unmanageable as he thinks. Roop and Claudine get married and galvanize their new family unit by banning together to protect the impassioned Charles from the police. Themes of family, faith, following one's heart, and fighting for what is right are woven throughout this story based in civil unrest and family disharmony.—T.B. Hayes Claudine tries to provide for her six children in Harlem while on welfare. She has a romance with Roop, a cheerful garbageman she meets while working on the side as a maid.—Will Gilbert"

The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four armed men hijack a New York City subway car and demand a ransom for the passengers. The city's police are faced with a conundrum: Even if it's paid, how could they get away? Four seemingly unrelated men board subway train Pelham 1:23 at successive stations. Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown are heavily armed and overpower the motorman and novice conductor to take control of the train. Between stations they separate the front car from the remainder of the train, setting passengers in the back cars and the motorman free. The four demand $1 million ransom within exactly one hour for the remaining eighteen hostages, including the conductor. If their demands are not met in time or their directions are not followed precisely, they will begin to shoot hostages dead, one every minute the money is late. Wisecracking Lt. Zach Garber of the transit police ends up being the primary communicator between the hijackers and the authorities, which includes transit operations, his own police force, the NYPD, and the unpopular and currently flu ridden mayor who will make the ultimate decision of whether to pay the ransom. Unknown to Garber, what may be working on their side is the disparate nature of the four hijackers, including methodical and unbending Blue, trigger happy Grey, and also under the weather Green, who may pass out before the caper has concluded. What Garber does know is that there is a plain clothes NYPD officer among the eighteen hostages. What Garber has to try and figure out is how the four hijackers can possibly get away, as they are in a tunnel and have to remain with the train since it has a dead-man mechanism which requires a motorman at the controls at all times.—Huggo Right under everyone's noses, a determined gang of four colour-coded and armed-to-the-teeth criminals manage to take over New York City's Pelham 1-2-3 subway train. In a confined metro rail coach crammed with eighteen helpless passengers, the ruthless criminals threaten to start killing one hostage a minute, unless a massive one-million-dollar ransom in cash is delivered within an hour. Under those circumstances, a frenzied race against time begins, as the gruff Transit Authority police lieutenant, Zachary Garber, tries to outwit his cunning adversary, Mr Blue. However, above the surface, chaos reigns. Will they deliver the money in time before the first man dies?—Nick Riganas Four armed men hijack a New York City subway train and demand 1 million dollars - which must be delivered in 1 hour - for the train and the lives of the passengers held hostage.

A veteran detective attempts to track down the identities of the gunmen in this offbeat crime film.—Keith Loh <loh@sfu.ca> In New York City, four heavily armed men with code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing disguises of eyeglasses, fedora hats, and fake mustaches, board at different station stops (the Green Line at 59th Street, Grey Line at 51st Street, Brown Line at Grand Central, and finally Blue Line at 28th Street) on the Pelham 123 subway train run of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service. The men take the train, securing a group of hostages, whom they isolate in one car of the train, then disconnect this car from the rest of the train.Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center. This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken."" Blue (Robert Shaw), the British-accented leader of the hijackers, tells Garber they are demanding a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour; otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute, starting when the hour has passed.Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away. Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out, first with his hearing Blue's very distinctive English accent over the radio. It later turns out that Blue was a ruthless British mercenary, and Green (Martin Balsam) is a former transit worker who from time to time sneezes over the radio and is heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit."" Garber also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor. The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money. When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the takers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it. A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers. With the money finally in hand, the hijackers demand that electric power be restored to the subway line, and that all signals in the path of the train be turned green from 28th Street to the South Ferry station, both of these being necessary for the car to move. Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, which would otherwise ensure its stopping unless someone remained at the throttle, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion. As the train starts to move, the undercover officer also jumps off the train and hides between the rails. The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.Outside the tunnel, Garber and Inspector Daniels are convinced that the runaway train is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left the train.The hijackers divide the ransom money, discard their disguises, and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed and is shot dead by Blue. The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot. Green escapes onto the street.Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to shoot the undercover officer. Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore. Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""Pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.Entering the South Ferry Loop, the runaway car finally encounters a red signal. The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.Green, the only hijacker to escape, has left as a clue only Garber's surmise that one of the hijackers must be an ex-motorman of the New York Transit Authority (owing to the hijackers' knowledge of the car's operation). With the dead three all identified, Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee. Garber and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman. Longman, known to the audience as Mr. Green, is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door. He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning. The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit."" Garber then re-opens the door, the expression on his face in the door opening (the film's final frame) telling the audience that he knows he has just found the final hijacker."

An sexy, voluptuous woman named Foxy Brown is on a rampage when her boyfriend is killed by an government agent. Using her body as a tool of attraction and her afro and her gun as a deadly weapon, it's up to Foxy to avenge her boyfriend's murder.—blazesnakes9 Ordering food at a taco stand late a night, local Los Angeles drug dealer Link Brown (Antonio Fargas) eyes two thugs, Eddie (Tony Giorgio) and Bunyon (Fred Lerner), who have followed him. Two police officers arrive and place food orders. At a nearby payphone, Link calls his sister, Foxy Brown (Pam Grier), to pick him up, telling her that the two thugs will attack him once the police officers leave. At her home, Foxy gets out of bed and changes clothes, hiding a gun inside her brassiere. Meanwhile, Link tries to engage the policemen in conversation, but they drive away, leaving him alone with Eddie and Bunyon. As the thugs close in on Link, Foxy hits them with her car, and Link jumps on the vehicle, sliding inside through the sunroof.Returning home with Link, Foxy demands an explanation. Link confesses to owing a loan shark $20,000 that he lost betting on numbers but argues that his petty crimes do not compare to her missing boyfriend's dishonorable work as a police informer. Link says he would have money if he could only go back to dealing cocaine. Hoping to keep her brother out of trouble, Foxy allows him to stay at her house. Meanwhile at Katherine Wall's (Kathryn Loder) office, Steve Elias (Peter Brown) chastises Eddie and Bunyon for losing Link.One day, Foxy delivers flowers to her boyfriend, Dalton Ford (Terry Carter), at the hospital. Foxy watches as his doctor removes the gauze covering his face, which has been altered so that he can take on the new identity of ""Michael Anderson,"" after having worked undercover for the Bureau of Narcotics for two years. Michael's boss, Adams (Ed Knight), allows him to leave the hospital for the day, supplying him with a new birth certificate and driver's license before he goes.That afternoon, Foxy and Michael take a walk and she spots her friend, Oscar (Bob Minor), on the street. They watch as Oscar and a cohort corner a drug dealer, beat him, and shove him into the back of a car. Foxy introduces Michael to her friend, and Oscar explains that he's part of a ""neighborhood committee"" working to expel drug dealers from the area. Because the dealers often bribe policeman for protection, the neighborhood committee must enforce their own form of vigilante justice.Link calls his girlfriend, Deb (Sally Ann Stroud), and she informs him that Elias's thugs came by the apartment and threatened her earlier that day. Link worries about the $20,000 he needs to pay them back but hangs up when his sister returns with Michael. After Foxy introduces the men, Link stares at Michael suspiciously and leaves the house. Foxy and Michael make love before he returns to the hospital where he must stay one more night.The next morning, Foxy finds Link reading an old newspaper article announcing Dalton's disappearance three months ago. Link guesses that someone made a lot of money exposing Dalton as an informer. Foxy leaves, and Link studies Dalton's picture in the article, tracing lines over his face. Detecting something in the picture, he makes a phone call.At the office of Tedesco (Jack Bernardi), a drug supplier, Leroy, a chemist (Robert Nadder), tests Tedesco's latest batch of heroin and assures Elias that the product is 80% pure. Arranging a deal with Tedesco, Elias agrees to fly the product in from Mexico on a small plane. Later, Miss Wall discusses a new rumor that Dalton is still alive with Elias and his thugs. Bunyon claims he killed Dalton months ago, but Elias doesn't believe him. Wall instructs the men to make sure Dalton is dead.Foxy returns home and finds the newspaper article Link was looking at, noticing that he traced over Dalton's facial features. Foxy worries her brother may have detected Michael's disguise. Moments later, Michael is shot outside her home. Seeking revenge, Foxy finds her brother at his apartment and shoots at him, demanding to know whom he told about Michael. Link claims ignorance, and she fires another shot that grazes his ear. Relenting, he tells Foxy about Katherine Wall, who runs a high-end female escort service and also controls the local drug syndicate.Foxy visits the Katherine Wall Modeling Agency to apply for work, using the name ""Misty Cotton."" Foxy tells Miss Wall she knows what goes on at the agency and is willing to sell her body for the right price. The following day, Foxy reports to Wall's house where several women are being groomed. Foxy is assigned to accompany an escort named Claudia (Juanita Brown) to a party. There, they must befriend Judge Fenton (Harry Holcombe), who will decide a case the next day involving two of Elias's drug dealers. Claudia says their goal is to make sure Fenton finds the dealers innocent; otherwise, Wall might send them to a place in Haiti where men do unspeakable things to prostitutes. Outside Wall's house, Claudia's estranged husband, Willard (Edward Cross), approaches with their young son, Jason, and announces they are moving to Seattle, Washington, where he has a job. Claudia begs him not to take her son away, and Willard suggests that she come to Seattle. Eddie, Elias and Wall overhear as Claudia tells Willard she feels trapped by her employers. Eddie and Elias beat Willard, sending him and Jason away.As they ride to the party, Foxy watches Claudia ingest pills. At a hotel suite, Claudia and Foxy find Fenton surrounded by colleagues and topless escorts. The women take Fenton to a bedroom, remove his pants, and shove him into the hallway to be ridiculed by passersby. Afterward, Claudia comments on the danger she and Foxy now face after botching the assignment, Foxy promises to take Claudia somewhere safe.The next day, Elias informs Wall that Fenton convicted their drug dealers, and assures her that his men are searching for Foxy and Claudia. Meanwhile, Claudia sneaks out of Foxy's house in search of a drink. At a lesbian bar, Claudia (a closeted lesbian herself) talks to a woman named Bobbie (Jeanine Epper). Foxy finds Claudia at the bar and says they must leave, but Bobbie objects, challenging her to a fight. Foxy knocks Bobbie down with a stool, inciting a bar brawl. Outside, Claudia and Foxy spot Eddie, Bunyon and Elias. The men give chase and, while Claudia jumps over a fence and escapes, Foxy fights them. The men trap Foxy and, later, Wall watches as they torture her. Elias tells Wall Foxy's real name and identifies her as Dalton Ford's former girlfriend. Wall orders them to give Foxy a shot of heroin and send her to ""the ranch.""Sometime later, Foxy wakes up in a rundown house and finds one of her captors, Slauson (Boyd Red Morgan), sleeping. She hears Brandt (H.B. Haggerty), another captor, singing outside. Foxy sneaks out of the house, but Slauson, who was only pretending to sleep, lassos her with a rope, drags her back inside, and ties her to the bed. Brandt administers more heroin to subdue Foxy and rapes her.After Brandt has left the room, Foxy uses her mouth to grab a straight razor from the bedside table. Cutting the ropes, Foxy frees herself and grabs several wire hangers from a closet, twisting them into a makeshift weapon. In the kitchen, she leans through an open window, grabs one end of a siphon connected to a barrel, and siphons gasoline into a pot on the stove. When Slauson approaches, she strikes his face multiple times with the hangers and he falls to the floor. Brandt rushes inside, and Foxy douses him with the gasoline, setting him and the house on fire.After hearing about the fire and suspecting Foxy of starting it and killing two of her men, Miss Wall orders Elias to find and kill her. Soon after, Eddie and Elias burst into Link's apartment and demand Foxy's whereabouts. Link claims he doesn't know, and Elias shoots him dead and they kill his girlfriend Deb by slashing her neck.At the offices of Oscar's neighborhood committee, Foxy learns of Link's murder. Oscar leads her into a room where the committee responds to Foxy's request for help. Though they are hesitant to become involved in Foxy's revenge against Wall, she begs the men to aid her for the sake of her dead brother. The committee wants to know if Foxy has a plan, and she asks if anyone knows the name of the pilot who works for Elias.At a bar by the airport, Foxy flirts with Elias's pilot, Hays (Sig Haig), telling him that she's never been on a plane but wants to go. Obliging her, Hays takes Foxy on his next flight. Soon after, he lands his small plane near a hideout where Elias, Eddie, and Leroy await. Near the hideout, Oscar and his men approach two police officers guarding the area. As Hays greets Elias and his cohorts with the drugs, Foxy starts the plane back up and drives it toward Bunyon, running him over and killing him. She crashes the plane into a shed, and Elias's men shoot at her, but the neighborhood committee members arrive, armed with guns, and shoot back. After they trap Elias, Foxy looks on as one of the members begins to torture him with a knife.That night, Foxy carries a bag into Miss Wall's home, but Eddie and another henchman stop her and take the bag. Inside, he finds a jar containing Elias's genitals. Foxy removes a small hand gun from her afro, shoots and kills the two henchman, then shoots Wall in the shoulder when she lunges at Foxy with a knife. Instead of killing her, Foxy says she wants Miss Wall to live and suffer, along with Elias. Ignoring Katherine Wall's angry shouts and threats of revenge, Foxy walks outside, gets into a car with Oscar and they both drive away."

The Parallax View,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071970/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ambitious reporter gets in way-over-his-head trouble while investigating a senator's assassination which leads to a vast conspiracy involving a multinational corporation behind every event in the world's headlines. Joe Frady is a determined reporter who often needs to defend his work to colleagues. After the assassination of a prominent U.S. senator, Frady begins to notice that reporters present during the assassination are dying mysteriously. After getting more involved in the case, Frady begins to realize that the assassination was part of a conspiracy somehow involving the Parallax Corporation, an enigmatic training institute. He then decides to enroll for the Parallax training himself to discover the truth.—Philip Brubaker <coda@nando.net> Joe Frady is a newspaper reporter wrapped up in a government conspiracy concerning a senator's murder. He knew people at the event when the senator was shot. Potential witnesses to the conspiracy are dying one after another. Frady gets a tip that a higher power may be at work here. Naturally as a reporter, he tries to do some detective work and conducts his own investigation on this string of deaths, which lands him in hot water. The conspirators may have become aware of his knowledge and thus anticipated his moves. Questionable things start happening to Frady, and he gets a foreboding feeling he might be the next one dead. Frady is living his life on the run like a fleeing prey, and can trust no one, thereby encapsulating him in an alienated world where he could be in the crosshairs at any moment. During Frady's ongoing investigation, he finds documents on the Parallax Corporation, which he believes is a front for recruiting political assassins. Frady decides to ""become"" a sociopath and enroll at the Parallax Corporation as he presumes that's the only way of uncovering the real truth. Besides, he doesn't have many options left before his time runs out. But he may have dug his grave even deeper. The official line: Senator Charles Carroll was assassinated by a lone gunman who also died at the scene, with no larger conspiracy involved in the assassination. Case closed. In the several following years after the assassination, six direct witnesses of the assassination - those that were featured in a published photograph - have themselves died, nothing seemingly tying these deaths together beyond the earlier event or deemed to be mysterious by authorities. However those four still surviving witnesses shown in the photograph, including television news reporter Lee Carter and Carroll's political advisor Austin Tucker, fear for their lives. Carter's newspaper investigative reporter colleague and former lover, Joe Frady, who was also at the event when the senator was assassinated, does not believe the conspiracy theory that Carter fears. Frady changes his opinion when more witness deaths occur. Frady, who has a history of irresponsibility in both his personal and professional life, decides to investigate. As he gets further into his investigative work, he does begin to think that the conspiracy theorists were correct, but that the conspiracy is much larger than even he could have imagined. Frady decides to go undercover, but there is race between Frady discovering the truth and the possible perpetrators discovering who Frady really is.—Huggo Seattle, WashingtonSenator Charles Carroll (William ""Bill"" Boyce), an independent senator, is holding a luncheon atop the Seattle Space Needle. Joe Frady (Warren Beatty), an alcoholic journalist, tries to gain entry to the luncheon, but is turned away. At the restaurant atop the Space Needle, Senator Carroll is holding a press conference when he is suddenly shot to death by an unseen assassin. Everyone looks around and sees a waiter holding a gun, and he is jumped by security guards. However, a second waiter (Bill McKinney), who also has a gun (and the real or second shooter) leaves unnoticed. The first waiter replies that he didn't do it, and he is chased over the roof of the building by guards, where he accidentally slips and falls off the roof to his death. The real assassin chuckles as he leaves the scene and reports to an unseen contact that the job is finished. Four months later, a seven-man commission holds a special public gathering and they conclude that the waiter, named Thomas Richard Lindern (Chuck Waters), acted alone and that there is no greater conspiracy to the assassination of Senator Carroll.Three years laterJoe Frady, writing for a Portland, Oregon newspaper, sets himself up to get arrested to get a story on a major drug bust. Frady is bailed out of jail by his boss and editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) who always complains that Frady is trying to create news rather than reporting it. Shortly thereafter, Frady is visited by Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss), a Seattle newscaster and his former girlfriend, who tells them that she fears for her life. Lee tells Frady that someone is trying to kill her and that six other reporters at the luncheon have all died mysteriously during the past two years. Frady shrugs her off by telling her that she's just being paranoid. But a few days later, Lee is found dead in her apartment. Frady investigates and the coroner tells him that she apparently killed herself with an overdose of sleeping pills, but Frady knows different.Frady tells Rintels that there is a story brewing here about the events behind the Senator Carroll assassination, and Rintels reluctantly agrees to let Frady pursue his story. Frady meets with a former FBI agent (Kenneth Mars) who informs him that they are many methods that can be used to make someone's death look like an accident or suicide such as certain drugs which are fatal, but show up that a person's heart failed on them.Frady travels to a small fishing village in upstate Washington where one of the witnesses to Carroll's assassination died. At the local bar, a rough deputy, named Red (Earl Hindman), tries to beat up Frady, but after a long and vicious fistfight, Frady wins, knocking out Deputy Red. The sheriff, L.D. Wicker (Kelly Thorsden), appears and applauds Frady for standing up to his loathsome deputy and he is rather friendly towards him. Frady asks the sheriff for information about the dead person, claiming to be an old friend.Sheriff L.D. takes Frady to the spot where the Carroll witness died: a small creek right in front of a large dam. The sheriff explains that the man, Alan Bridges, was fishing when a dam sluice had opened up, releasing tons of water to relieve pressure on the dam as it does every few days and that that Bridges was washed away and drowned. Just then, a siren announces that the dam sluice is opening again. Suddenly, the sheriff pulls a gun on Frady... clearly intending to kill him in the same way he killed Mr. Bridges. Frady throws his fishing rod at the sheriff and tackles him where they both fall into the water. Frady and the sheriff struggle as they are swept away by the wall of water that hits both of them. Frady grabs a shore rock and makes it ashore while the sheriff is swept away and drowns.Taking Sheriff L.D.'s car, Frady goes to the sheriff's apartment to search it for evidence and finds test applications to the Parallax Corporation. Just then, Deputy Red arrives at the apartment looking for the sheriff and Frady runs. After a long and wild car case, Frady escapes from the deputy.Returning to Portland, Frady tells Rintels what happened and shows him the copies of the Parallax Corporation application tests, and that there's something big going on. But Rintels refuses to believe Frady is onto something. Frady takes the test application to a psychology lab where the attending psychoanalyst believes that the tests are for measuring one's mental state and ability to commit crimes. Frady allows a lab worker, and a former prison convict who served time for murder, to take the test. Using the alias of ""Richard Paley"", Frady submits the finished test result to Parallax.A few days later, Frady meets with Austin Tucker (William Daniels), a former Carroll aide, who has arrived in the country and claims that people are trying to kill him for Senator Carroll had many enemies from his past for his liberal views and work. Tucker and his aide/bodyguard take Frady out on a sailboat where he confides in Frady that there is indeed a wide conspiracy in the Carroll assassination and that Thomas Richard Lindern did not act alone and that a powerful corporation may have covered it up. Tucker shows photos that were taken of the luncheon on that day, and points to the second waiter in one of the photographs and asks Frady if he knows the man. Frady doesn't and asks why. Tucker tells Frady that it's probably nothing, but Tucker also explains that he cannot shake the feeling that the second waiter looks familiar. A few minutes later, the boat explodes from a bomb hidden in the cabin. Frady sitting on the bow of the boat jumps overboard, while Tucker and his aide, catching the full blast, are killed.Frady meets with Rintels and tells him about what happened and Rintels agrees to help Frady with his story. Using his alias, Frady checks himself into a fleabag motel in downtown Los Angeles, and a few days later a certain 'Jack Younger' (Walter McGinn), claiming to be a representative of the Parallax Corporation, contacts Frady in his room and says that his aggressiveness (as shown on the test answers) makes him valuable for certain corporations. Younger asks Frady/Richard Paley to join the corporation for the 'special projects' division.Frady goes to the Parallax offices in downtown L.A. and meets with Mr. Younger who shows him a special room where Frady is 'tested' with a series of brainwashing techniques with him being shown various photos and images of death and destruction as if to make him suitable for indoctrination. Frady becomes aware that this branch of the Parallax is a training ground for assassins.As Frady is leaving the building for the day when his 'tests' are finished, he spots the second waiter from the Tucker photo talking to some businessmen. Frady follows the second waiter/assassin outside to his car and tails him driving around the city. The assassin switches cars with another person, and obtains a briefcase which he takes to the local airport.The assassin checks himself on a plane to Chicago, and Frady checks himself on the same plane. The plane takes off, but the assassin does not board for he has apparently checked in his briefcase which has a bomb in it. On the plane, Frady sees that that assassin is nowhere to be found, and after seeing that a prominent senator on board, realizes that the plane must have a bomb on board. After trying to sneak a message on a restroom mirror, Frady anonymously passes a note on a napkin to a stewardess that a bomb is on board. The stewardess relays the news to the pilot who immediately returns the plane to Los Angeles. After everyone has disembarked, the plane explodes (off-camera).Frady returns to his seedy motel room to find Mr. Younger waiting for him and he informs Frady that Parallax have already had an offer of employment for Frady, but he immediately expresses suspicion as a background check made by Parallax on Frady showed that some of his references were false. Frady then makes up a new alias for Younger explaining that he's an alcoholic and lied on his background to land a job. Younger offers to look into it and again promises Frady that Parallax is a great opportunity for people like him, and then leaves.Realizing that it will only be a matter of time before they discover his real identity, Frady secretly mails the Parallax test papers and an audiotape he made on a mini-tape recorder of his conversation with Younger to Rintels. Along with it is a note from Frady who explains that he may be in way over his head and that if anything were to happen to him, that Rintels should publish this information about Parallax and what they do on the sidelines of recruiting assassins to kill prominent officials who threaten or get too close to the corporation's nefarious plans. Rintels listens to the tape and finally realizes that Frady is onto something big. Rintels, who practically lives in his office and orders take-out food every day from a deli across the street, orders more food as he reviews more of the papers Frady has mailed to him. Just then, the deli delivery guy arrives with Rintels' latest food order. The delivery guy is the Parallax assassin in disguise. The next morning, Rintels is found dead by his employees in his office, dead from an apparent ""heart attack"" after he was poisoned. The evidence is gone and the audio tape has been erased.In Los Angeles, Frady, unaware of Rintels' murder and that he is now on his own, gets his first assignment to meet with his new co-worker at a local hotel for their ""assignments"". Frady sneaks out of the planned meeting place and goes to Parallax's offices asking to meet with Mr. Younger, but is told that Younger is out. Frady spots the Parallax assassin and follows him into the hallways of the L.A. Convention Center. Mr. Younger is there with more Parallax businessmen/assassins where they are talking about their latest plans. Frady watches them from a distance as Mr. Younger leaves and the Parallax assassin and a few others go to the platforms above the floor of the convention hall.Frady sees that down below a dress rehearsal where Senator George Hammond (Jim Davis), a prominent California senator, is rehearsing a speech he will give that night. Frady believes that the assassin is going to shoot the senator with a rifle that he loads and lies down on the walkway above the convention hall. Then, just as Senator Hammond is planning to leave before he makes his appearance, the assassin suddenly leaves, leaving Frady in hiding on the walkway, alone and locked in the area. Suddenly, shots ring out as one of the assassins shoots and kills Hammond with a second rifle from a concealed location, just as Hammond is riding in a golf cart out of the convention hall. Everyone looks up and around for the shooter, and sees Frady.... standing on the plank way above them near the unused rifle. THEY THINK HE DID IT!!!! Frady realizes (way too late) that he's been set up! Frady hides under the plank way as three Parallax security guards/assassins show up looking for him. When police sirens are heard, the three assassins flee, leaving the door to the exit wide open. After a few minutes, Frady tries to run for the exit, when the assassin appears as a menacing silhouette in the doorway (anticipating that Frady would do just that) and guns him down.Several months later, a second seven-man congressional commission is held where the lead commissioner reports that Frady had blamed Senator Hammond for the Senator Carroll assassination and had sought revenge. (Note: it is never explained if any of both the seven-man commissions are in league with Parallax, or if they are only easily duped into believing the fabricated evidence.) The commission rules that there is no evidence of a conspiracy in the killing of Senator Hammond. Frady was the lone assassin. Case closed. The commission does not take questions from the unseen press."

When the building, in which he lives, is torn down to make way for a parking garage, Harry and his beloved cat Tonto begin a journey across the U.S., visiting his children, seeing a world he never seemed to have the time to see before, making new friends, and saying goodbye to old friends.—Gary Dickerson <slug@mail.utexas.edu> Widowed septuagenarian Harry Coombes lives with his beloved cat Tonto in the same inner city New York City apartment he has for much of his adult life. So it is with great resistance that Harry moves from that apartment as his building is scheduled for immediate demolition. With no plans as to where to live, he and Tonto move in with his son Bert Coombes and his family in the suburbs. Independent minded Harry knows this situation is not either to his liking nor to Bert's wife's liking. Before making a decision as to a permanent living situation, Harry, with Tonto in tow, decides to visit his bookstore owning divorcée daughter Shirley Mallard in Chicago, Illinois. But the planned New York City to Chicago flight changes out of circumstances to a road trip. Along the way, Harry and Tonto meet a variety of people which affect his thoughts and ultimately where he goes, which includes a possible visit with Jessie Stone, an old flame he hasn't seen in fifty years, and a visit with his irresponsible playboy son Eddie Coombes in Los Angeles, California.—Huggo As elderly people go about their day in Manhattan, Harry walks along a sidewalk with his tabby cat Tonto on a leash, quoting Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" as he goes. Harry stops in at a grocer, buys some good food for his cat, and jokes that his sexual days are over.Next Harry meets his old friend Jacob on a bench, and tells him that his apartment building is being torn down to build a parking lot. Jacob complains about capitalists, and reassures Harry that he could always move in with him.On the way home, a kid tries to steal Harry's groceries and knocks him down. Harry is helped up by Leroy, his building super.Harry gets into his apartment and talks to Tonto, lamenting that he's been mugged four times in the past year, and that the whole city is getting run down.Some time later, police show up to forcibly remove Harry and his furniture from the building. Harry continues to spout ""King Lear"" while his son Burt arrives to pick him up.Harry goes to live with Burt and his wife and two grown sons in the suburbs.

He then tells Burt he is going to Chicago to visit Shirley, Burt's sister, but before he leaves he stops at a city morgue to identify the body of Jacob, who has died with no relatives. Harry cries after recalling Jacob's story of losing his virginity.Burt takes Harry to the airport, but Harry soon learns that he can't go through security with Tonto, so he takes a cab to get a bus.

He remembers they had many good times though. He confesses to Tonto that he has a great fear of pain, and that when he dies he would like to go quickly rather than the slow way his wife Annie died.Harry picks up two young hitchhikers, one of whom soon gets another ride, while the other a girl named Ginger continues west with Harry. She claims she is 16, and is running away from home to a commune in Boulder.Harry and Ginger get a motel for the night, and after she comes out of the bathroom half-naked, Harry is prompted to recall the first girl he loved, Jessie, whom he has not seen in 50 years. Ginger suggests that they go to see her, even though it's out of their way, and they eventually find her in a nursing home.At first Harry thinks Jessie remembers him, but her thoughts are marked by senility; she calls him Alex yet remembers his wife Annie. Then she suddenly asks Harry to dance, which they do while Ginger looks on.Harry and Ginger make it to Chicago, where Shirley runs a bookstore. Harry is surprised to see Norman there, who has been sent in advance by Burt to meet him, and who is now talking. Shirley is curt with Harry and Ginger, and is mourning the end of her fourth marriage.Shirley and Harry go for a walk by the edge of Lake Michigan, and she encourages him to return to teaching; he says he is too old. They have an awkward exchange, and agree to be more civil to each other.Harry drives on with Norman and Ginger, reaching Arizona. Harry calls Burt and has Norman explain his situation, which does not go over well. Harry tells Burt he is moving on to Los Angeles to visit Eddie, his other son, while Norman tells Burt that he is going with Ginger to Boulder.Harry thus gives the car to them, and wonders off to a motel, where he meets a traveling salesman of natural health products.

Eddie acts as if he's been living off his real estate deals, but when they get to his apartment, he confesses to his father that he is broke.Eddie cries in shame, and Harry consoles him that they will somehow find a way to help each other financially.

Captain, who commanded a concentration camp during World War II. After reading the diary of an elderly Jewish man who committed suicide, freelance journalist Peter Miller begins to investigate the alleged sighting of a former S.S. Captain who commanded a concentration camp during World War II. Miller eventually finds himself involved with the powerful organization of former S.S. members, called ""O.D.E.S.S.A."", as well as with the Israeli secret service. Miller probes deeper and eventually discovers a link between the S.S. Captain, ""O.D.E.S.S.A."", and his own family.—Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> In 1963, freelance journalist Peter Miller is given the diary of an old man, Solomon Tauber, who had recently committed suicide. The diary deals with Tauber's incarceration at the Riga concentration camp. Miller becomes quite interested in the camp's commander, Eduard Roschmann, who he learns vanished after the end of the war. His enquiries with the police are not well received and he is warned to be careful, something he takes quite seriously after someone tries to kill him by pushing him in front of a moving train. He learns there is an organization known by the acronym ""O.D.E.S.S.A."", which assists former members of the S.S. to obtain new identities and evade the authorities. The secret organization has infiltrated all levels of German society and will apparently stop at nothing to protect its members. Israeli intelligence is also keen on infiltrating O.D.E.S.S.A. and satisfied that Miller isn't an impostor, assist him in going undercover as a former S.S. camp guard needing assistance. Miller is soon found out by those who run the organization, but he manages to locate Roschman nonetheless. Miller, it turns out, has his own personal reasons for having wanted to find him.—garykmcd In 1963, young Peter Miller is working as a freelance journalist in Hamburg. He happens upon the diary of Salomon Tauber, an elderly German Jew who just committed suicide. The diary details Tauber's stay at Riga Concentration Camp during World War II under the sadistic command of S.S. Captain Eduard Roschmann, who Tauber saw alive from afar only three weeks prior in Hamburg. The sighting of Roschmann was the reason for Tauber's suicide. After reading the diary, Peter becomes obsessed with finding Roschmann. He soon learns that many of the S.S. were assisted in escaping following the war by a group called ""O.D.E.S.S.A."", which is still active in advancing the ideals of Nazi Germany. O.D.E.S.S.A. has become secretly ingrained in all aspects of power in Germany. One of the current O.D.E.S.S.A. projects is perfecting biological warfare rocket attacks in order to annihilate Israel, the work for which is being conducted by an unknown but legitimate German company whose workers are unaware of their task. For their mutual benefit, the Israeli Secret Service co-opts Peter into going undercover to infiltrate O.D.E.S.S.A., Peter agreeing only on the understanding that he will deal with Roschmann in his own way. As Peter gets deeper in his investigation, he places his life and that of his girlfriend, Sigi, in danger.—Huggo The movie opens in September 1963 with armored maneuvers in the Israeli desert. A top Israeli military leader confers with a Mossad agent, explaining that the Egyptians are massing 400 rockets in Helwan, arming the warheads with bubonic plague and radioactive Strontium 90. The missiles are targeted on Israeli cities, needing only an advanced guidance system to make them operational. The guidance system is being perfected somewhere in Germany under the sponsorship of ODESSA, an organization of former high-ranking SS officials. It is a race against time.The action switches to Hamburg, Germany in November of the same year. A young and ambitious freelance journalist named Peter Miller (Jon Voight) drives through the streets of Hamburg, which are festively decorated for the holidays. An announcement over Miller's car radio grabs his attention. President John F. Kennedy has been assassinated in Dallas. As Miller sadly listens to the news, emergency vehicles speed past. Miller follows them and stops at an old apartment building, where the upstairs windows have been flung open. A policeman friend explains to Miller that a lonely old man has gassed himself and there is no story to be had. Back home in bed with his dancer girlfriend Sigi (Mary Tamm), Miller muses that the first photographs of Kennedy's killer might fetch two million marks. Sigi scolds him as a parasite who profits from other people's misfortune.The next day, Miller meets his police officer friend for lunch and is loaned the diary that had been kept by the deceased old man, Salomon Tauber. The police officer coyly suggests that Miller might find the contents interesting. Miller takes the diary home and discovers that Tauber and his wife Esther were German Jews who had been inmates at the Riga concentration camp. Tauber's diary details the sadistic butchery of camp commandant Eduard Roschman (Maximilian Schell). Tauber's wife had been gassed, but he was determined to survive and be a witness against Nazi war crimes. The diary goes on to detail an incident that Tauber had witnessed on the Riga docks in October 1944. With the Russians rapidly advancing, the Germans were desperately evacuating thousands of wounded troops by ship. Eduard Roschman had suddenly appeared on the docks, seeking to commandeer a ship for his SS troops. He met determined resistance from a courageous Wehrmacht captain who knocked Roschman to the ground. Roschman shot the captain dead, and as he fell his rare Knights Cross bravery medal with Oak Leaf clusters had spilled into the snow.Miller is greatly upset by Tauber's sad tale, and he sets out to investigate further. Despite being discouraged by his girlfriend, his editor and his own mother (Maria Schell), Miller returns to Tauber's apartment building and bribes the hard-boiled manager into letting him see Tauber's meager possessions. The manager discloses that Tauber had only one friend, an old Jewish man named Marx. Miller tracks him down and learns that Tauber had only recently seen Roschman in Hamburg.Upon reporting it to the police, Tauber was completely ignored. He had come up against the ODESSA. Despairing that justice would never be done, Tauber killed himself.Following up on old Marx's revelation, Miller visits the State War Crimes office to look up Roschman's records. Hearing his inquiries, an officious bureaucrat (and ODESSA member) comes out to shoo Miller away, but Miller overhears a telephone conversation about the upcoming annual reunion of the bureaucrat's German army division. Miller determines to crash the party. He runs into trouble when he snaps a flash picture of a shadowy and mysterious speaker. He is thrown from the hall and returns home battered and bloody, his camera smashed.The following day, Miller accompanies Sigi on a Christmas shopping trip. While waiting on the subway platform, Miller is suddenly pushed off the platform into the path of an oncoming train, narrowly escaping with his life. Undeterred, Miller travels to Vienna to look up famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. Miller's dogged persistence is starting to seriously alarm the leadership of ODESSA. Miller manages to secure an interview with Wiesenthal, who enlightens him about ODESSA and its mission to protect Nazi war criminals and their activities. Wiesenthal informs Miller that ODESSA provides SS criminals with forged identities. If Miller wants to find Roschman, he needs to find the forger who created his identity papers.Back at his hotel, Miller is approached by an ODESSA emissary who tries to claim Roschman is long dead. When that story falls flat, the man warns Miller to drop his pursuit of Roschman, but Miller angrily refuses. At a highway rest stop, Miller is abducted by a group of men, but they turn out to be Israeli intelligence agents, not ODESSA. They know about his pursuit of Roschman, but they are skeptical about who he is working for. Once they are convinced of his intentions, the Israelis convince Miller to work with them in penetrating ODESSA. The Israelis capitalize on their local intelligence assets to create an alternate identity for Miller, using the name Rolf Gunter Kolb, a former SS man who has just expired from a stomach tumor.Meanwhile, back in Hamburg, ODESSA has assigned an assassin to kill Miller, but they haven't been able to find him since his ""disappearance"" near Vienna. One evening as Sigi is leaving the nightclub, she is chased down in the Elbe tunnel by the hired killer. He demands to know Miller's whereabouts. Just in the nick of time, a passing car interrupts the attack. Sigi flags down the auto, conveniently driven by an ODESSA member of the police department. The policeman pressures Sigi to take in a ""police woman"" who will ensure her safety.The Israelis place Miller in the hands of an expert who rigorously indoctrinates him in the rituals, slogans and beliefs of the SS. Miller's underarm is even disfigured with a red-hot iron bar to conceal the SS blood group tattoo that would have been there. Once he is deemed ready, Miller (posing as Kolb) is sent to contact a known ODESSA member, using the cover story that he was recognized by a Jewish hospital orderly who had been held at Flossenburg concentration camp, where Kolb had served. Kolb is supposedly on the run, looking for refuge with his former comrades.After passing a thorough screening, Miller is sent on to the organization's document forger in Bayreuth. After being dropped off at the Munich train station, Miller calls Sigi in Hamburg and is surprised to hear the police woman answer the phone. The police woman reports the call to her ODESSA employers and they realize that Miller has fooled them. Their assassin is dispatched to intercept Miller when he arrives in Bayreuth.Miller arrives at the forger's shop first, where proprietor Klaus Wenzer (Derek Jacobi) explains that passport photos are required, and the photographer won't arrive until Monday. Miller is sent to a nearby hotel to pass the time. Later that night, the hit man arrives at the shop and instructs Wenzer to contact Miller and tell him the photographer has arrived early. Miller is summoned but approaches the shop warily. He spots the hit man's sleek XKE sports car concealed nearby. Peering through a window, Miller sees the killer waiting in the shop. Miller climbs through an upstairs window and encounters Wenzer's invalid and senile mother, who mistakes Miller's dark clothing for that of a priest. She confides her worries about her son and his dangerous work, and how the ODESSA had killed her husband when he was no longer useful. She tells Miller about a secret file that her son has kept in the safe as insurance against the same fate, detailing the false identities and current photographs of all the ODESSA men he has worked with. She discloses that the safe combination is the same as the shop phone number. Miller sneaks up on the assassin and kills him after a desperate fight. Opening the safe, Miller discovers the incriminating ODESSA file, including the new identity and current image of Eduard Roschman. He takes the gunman's weapon and car and heads for Munich, where he deposits the file in a train station locker for safekeeping.Miller contacts Sigi and tells her to meet him in Heidelberg, but not to tell anyone where she is going. Sigi manages to lock the police woman in her room and flee. After a brief reunion, Miller tells Sigi about the ODESSA file and gives her the key to the locker. He instructs her that in the event he fails to return, she is to retrieve the file and deliver it to Simon Wiesenthal in Vienna. Miller then leaves in search of Roschman.Roschman's new identity is that of Hans Josef Kiefel, the wealthy owner of a large electrical concern. Miller attends the opening of a trade fair at Kiefel Electric and spots the notorious SS butcher. Miller follows him to his secluded castle on a wooded estate, where Roschman is protected by the local police. Miller carefully gains entrance to the castle through a basement door and confronts Roschman at gunpoint in his study. Roschman tries to buy time, alternately trying to deny the grisly truth and defend the Nazi cause, thinking Miller is just a misguided young idealist. But then Miller produces the photo of the handsome Wehrmacht captain Roschman had shot on the Riga docks so long ago, asking Roschman if he remembers the incident. Roschman dismissively owns up to the crime before Miller reveals that the captain was his father.Roschman is stunned, now understanding that he is dealing with something entirely different than he had thought. Roschman takes advantage of Miller's distracted agitation and works his way over to his desk, pulling out a pistol. He fires at Miller before Miller manages to gun him down.It is subsequently revealed that Miller was held for only three weeks and then released. As instructed, Sigi had delivered the ODESSA file to Wiesenthal, resulting in great embarrassment for the West German government and the arrest of many Nazi war criminals. The research facilities of Kiefel Electric, where the missile guidance systems were being developed, mysteriously burned to the ground. The rockets of Helwan never flew."

The younger son of a working-class Jewish family in Montreal, Duddy Kravitz yearns to make a name for himself in society. This film chronicles his short and dubious rise to power, as well as his changing relationships with family and friends. Along the way the film explores the themes of anti-semitism and the responsibilities which come with adulthood.—Isabel Piedmont <ipiedmon@indiana.edu> It's the post WWII era. Taxi driver Max Kravitz, who pimps on the side, lives with his two grown sons - early twenty-something medical student Lennie Kravitz, and late teen Duddy Kravitz, who has just graduated from high school - in the working class Jewish neighborhood of Montréal. Lennie receives all the positive attention from family and others of authority in the neighborhood, especially from Max's businessman brother, their Uncle Benjy, who is financing Lennie's medical school education, while Duddy is on the most part neglected. The only elder in the family and in the neighborhood who shows Duddy any respect is their zaida. As such, Duddy aspires to his zaida's assertion that land ownership is the way to make a name for oneself, especially after Duddy finds a lake, the entire property around which he would like to purchase. With only his ingenuity and chutzpah at hand, both of which he has plenty, Duddy embarks on one get rich scheme after another to make money to buy the land, usually following the belief that doing favors for those in power will yield financial favors in return. By Duddy's side through many of these schemes is his French-Canadian Catholic girlfriend Yvette, who loves Duddy but hates how he reduces his affections for her to economic terms. Yvette stays with Duddy despite the probability that there is no long term future for them due to their religious differences. The primary questions become whether Duddy's high risk ventures will ultimately result in his end goal of being able to buy all the land, whether this goal is worth it at any cost, whether he will garner respect from his family and the community, and whether he will find true happiness and ultimate fulfillment in achieving these.—Huggo"

Scenes from a Marriage,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6725014/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Scenes from a Marriage chronicles the many years of love and turmoil that bind Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johan (Erland Josephson) through matrimony, infidelity, divorce, and subsequent partners. Following two characters, Marianne and Johan, the film, in typical Bergman style, examines ontological questions of love, loneliness, being and what it means to be 'fulfilled'. As with all of Bergman's films, 'Scenes From a Marriage' is not simply a narrative about a married couple and their 'ups and downs'. Bergman successfully probes into what it means and feels like to need the love and/or security, validation of another person and the consequences of life-changing decisions."

Locking eyes in a crowded lobby, they are immediately sucked back into a dark and deadly past of which neither has ever been able to escape. As it turns out, Lucia is a bored housewife, married to an overworked businessman. Seeing Max after all these years calls to mind the memories of the heinous life of hers lived in captivity in the concentration camps of the war. It also brings forth a flood of confused emotions, brought about by the strange sexual relations she explored with her captor as a young woman. Max, equally distraught, fears being found out. Did she deliberately seek him out? Has she come to turn him in? It doesn't help that Max continues to keep ties and friendships with his fellow Nazi comrades. Have they something to do with this? He decides to confront her to find out. Pretty soon, the two resume their manic and doomed love affair, with conspirators slowly closing in on them. 1957. Max works as a night porter at the Hotel zur Oper in Vienna. During the war, he was an SS officer based in a concentration camp, where to his captors he posed as a doctor conducting research allowing him even more intrusive access. He has maintained connections with some of his Nazi colleagues, who have gone through the process of conducting mock trials one by one to expose weaknesses in their defense and when evidence, especially documents, which may incriminate them should and will be destroyed. Max's trial is the next one to be conducted. Upon simultaneously seeing each other, Max and a hotel guest, Lucia Atherton, the wife of an orchestra conductor for an opera company she who is following her husband on an opera tour, instantly recognize each other from the war years, when she was a prisoner at the same concentration camp. Although they try to avoid each other at all cost, they eventually do purposefully meet in their emotional need taking over, that need being their form of love for each other as they were in a sadomasochistic relationship at the time. The problem for them becomes Max's colleagues who would see Lucia as one of those threats to expose their past, such a threat which would need to be eliminated.—Huggo The dark and melancholy story of a former teenage Nazi concentration camp inmate, Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), and the S.S. officer who was her torturer and lover, Max (Sir Dirk Bogarde), who accidentally meet again in a Vienna hotel in 1957, where Max works as the night porter. They resume their sadomasochistic relationship, although Max's former S.S. comrades have something different in mind for them. The story unfolds like a gruesome dance of death.—Tim Kallinis <bt404@torfree.net> During World War II, Maximilian Theo Aldorfer (Dirk Bogarde), a former Nazi SS officer who had posed as a doctor to take sensational photographs in concentration camps, and Lucia Atherton (Charlotte Rampling), a Holocaust survivor, had an ambiguous sadomasochistic relationship. Flashbacks show Max tormenting Lucia, but also acting as her protector.In present day 1957, Lucia, now married to an American orchestra conductor, meets Max again by chance. He is now a night porter at a hotel in Vienna, Austria and a reluctant member of a group of former SS comrades who have been carefully covering up their pasts by destroying documents and eliminating witnesses to their wartime activities. Max has an upcoming mock trial at the hands of the group for his war crimes. The group's leader, Hans Folger (Gabriele Ferzetti), accuses Max of wanting to live 'hidden away like a church mouse'. Max wishes to remain hidden, but he voices support for the group's activities. Memories of the past punctuate Max and Lucia's present with urgent frequency, suggesting that Lucia survived through her relationship with Max. In one such flashback, Lucia sings a Marlene Dietrich song, ""Wenn ich mir was wünschen dürfte"" (""If I could make a wish""), to the camp guards while wearing pieces of an SS uniform, and Max 'rewards' her with the severed head of a male inmate who had been bullying her, a reference to Salome.Because she could testify against him, Lucia's existence is a threat to Max. He goes to see a former Nazi collaborator, Mario (Ugo Cardea), who knows Lucia is still alive; Max murders him to protect his secret. After Lucia's husband leaves town on business, Max and Lucia renew their past lovemaking in Max's apartment. Max confesses to Countess Stein, another guest at his hotel, that he has found his ""little girl"" again. The Countess tells him that he is insane; Max replies that they are both 'in the same boat'. Meanwhile, Folger has Max spied on by a teenage bellboy who works at the hotel.Max is interviewed by the police about Mario's murder. He spends days with Lucia in his apartment, chaining her to the wall so that ""they can't take her away"" and sleeps little. Folger, who wants Lucia to testify against Max in the mock trial-though he harbors more ambiguous long-term intentions toward her-visits and informs her that Max is ill. He suggests that Lucia must also be ill to allow herself to be in this position, but Lucia sends him away, claiming to be with Max of her own free will.The SS officers are infuriated at Max for hiding a key witness. Max refuses to go through with the trial, calling it 'a farce', and admits that he works as a night porter due to his sense of shame in daytime. He returns to Lucia, telling her that the police questioned him and others at the hotel about her disappearance, and that no suspicion fell on him.Eventually, Max quits his job, devoting all of his time to Lucia. The SS officers cut off the couple's supply of food from a nearby grocery store. Max barricades the door to the apartment, and he and Lucia begin rationing. Max seeks help by phoning one of his old hotel friends, who refuses, and imploring his neighbor, but she is prevented from providing aid by Adolph, the youth who had spied on Max earlier. Max retreats again to the apartment, where Lucia is almost unconscious from malnutrition. After one of the SS cuts off the electricity in Max's apartment, Max and Lucia, respectively dressed in his Nazi uniform and a negligee resembling the one she had worn in the concentration camp, leave the building and drive away; they are soon followed by a car driven by Max's former colleagues. Max parks his car on a bridge, where he and Lucia walk along the sidewalk as dawn breaks. Two gunshots ring out, and the doomed lovers fall dead."

As they feel they collectively are the best, the only thing that is holding them back is money to build the best vehicle possible. As such, they decide to rob a supermarket's office of the money in its safe to pursue their dream. On the most part, their robbery is successful, although their plan breaks down in its end phase, which doesn't allow them as much getaway time as they wanted. Another problem they face is an unexpected third person in their getaway, Larry's one-night stand Mary Coombs, who doesn't like the fact that Larry ran off on her, although she eventually also says that she doesn't want any of the money. With a police scanner and two-way radio in their souped-up Dodge Charger, they try to outrun the police, who have an identification of their vehicle, and a general description of the three. The police pursuit is led by the tenacious Sheriff Everett Franklin, who knows he and his team can catch them, but also knows that the three may be able to get out of the state to ""freedom"" through a grove of walnut trees, which Larry, Deke and Mary may or may not know.

Almost.—Larry Rayder Deke, a race car mechanic, drives to a motel where his partner, Larry, spent the night with a young blonde named Mary. As Larry gets into the driver's seat, he asks Deke about building a faster car, but Deke tells him ""speed is expensive."" Driving past a supermarket, Larry mentions the increasing price of groceries, then drops Deke off at the home of the store's manager, George Stanton. Deke accosts George's wife Evelyn in the shower and holds the woman and her daughter, Cindy, hostage, while Larry goes back to the market. Meanwhile, Mary, who is displeased at being left at the motel, follows Larry into the market's parking lot. Larry calls Deke from a pay phone to report that an armored truck made its cash delivery to the market and Deke commands Evelyn to call George with their demands. After hearing back from Deke, Larry goes to George's office and complains that the manager failed to open the safe as instructed. When Larry orders Deke to use force against Cindy, George empties the safe into a grocery bag. Larry returns to his car to find Mary lying seductively across the front seat and the keys missing from the ignition. Grabbing the grocery bag, Mary realizes Larry robbed the store and taunts him by throwing keys into a nearby dumpster. As Larry goes after them, she starts the car and explains that she threw away her own keys. Larry invites Mary to accompany him, then speeds over to the house to pick up Deke. In the store, George tries to contact Evelyn and discovers the phone is connected to a threatening tape recording. Meanwhile, as the culprits drive out of town, they listen to a two-way radio for police reports and Mary asks Larry about his career as a race car driver.When police captain Franklin Everett is briefed about the case, he is frustrated that the getaway car is an undistinguished Chevrolet, but the reporting officer points out that witnesses assumed the vehicle was customized for racing. Back in the car, Mary bickers with Deke and Larry shows off his racing skills by speeding between two oncoming trucks. At the police station, Franklin calls off the roadblocks and orders his officers to ""sweep search"" the area. Although Franklin is berated by his superior, Donahue, for changing strategy, the getaway car is soon spotted by an officer in a lookout tower. When Mary starts a fight with Larry by suggesting his stunts will attract attention, the vehicle veers off the road into a barn's fence and breaks down. Mary and Larry continue to bicker, but when Larry compels her to leave, Deke tells him that they need her assistance to fix the car. Larry runs after Mary and elicits sympathy by confessing that he stole money so he and Deke could build a race car fast enough to fulfill his dream of becoming a champion driver. Back on the road, Larry stops at a country store and tells Mary to buy medicine for Deke's injured hand, then speeds away without her. Larry and Deke soon realize that Mary stole their map and turn around to retrieve her. After, a police chase ensues with an officer named Hank, but Deke's engineering gives the Chevrolet an advantage and the police car's engine blows up. Meanwhile, Donahue orders Franklin to return to headquarters, but Franklin accuses his superior of wanting the thieves to escape so he can justify his demand for more resources in their district.Boarding a helicopter, Franklin learns by the pilot it is low on fuel, but Franklin firmly instructs him to continue their mission. Elsewhere, the outlaws pull into a local swap meet where Larry and Deke have a sports car waiting for them. The men transfer their belongings to the new car while Mary robs a swap meet patron and runs into an unsavory gang of former companions.

Back at the police station, Hanks meets a mechanic furnishing a squad car with racing capabilities for the officer. When the outlaws fail to reach the roadblock, Franklin realizes they have a radio and gives them a warning. In response, Mary impersonates a dispatcher and reports that the suspects are apprehended at a distant location. Franklin suspends the roadblock and changes the course of the helicopter, but a passing squad car notices the outlaws' car at the pool hall's gas station and Larry speeds off, knocking over the attendant and the squad car losing control and crashing into an adjacent house.Although believing they have eluded the police, Larry continues to race through the countryside and gets a flat tire after sideswiping a farm truck. As they change the tire in a secluded grove, Franklin blackmails Mary over the radio, offering to overlook her parole violation and keep her out of prison. When Larry argues with Mary and pushes her to the ground, Deke defends her, but Larry refers to his partner's impotence and storms away. Mary suggests that she and Deke escape with the money, but Deke explains that his alcoholism caused him to be rejected by the racing world and would not be able to find work as a mechanic for any other driver. When Larry returns, they drive away and are chased by Hank in his customized squad car. Hank keeps up with Larry until another car sideswipes Hank and a telephone pole falls on his vehicle. Franklin pursues the outlaws in the helicopter and orders the pilot to force them off the road, but the aircraft runs out of fuel and are forced to pull away. Furious, Franklin radios police cars to the surrounding roads, setting the outlaws on a difficult course to avoid them. Back at the police station, Donahue realizes that Franklin is trying to make the outlaws run out of gas, but Deke detects there are no police cars on the roads. As the outlaws congratulate themselves for getting away, a distracted Larry speeds toward an oncoming train and the car explodes into flames, upon impact."

However, his older brother and his gang refuse to let the murder of their friend and mentor go unsolved and they decide to band together and crack the case.—Ryan M. Burgos The steamy summer of 1974 Galveston, Texas is the backdrop for this ""Blaxplotation"" Classic, starring Lincoln Kilpatrick as ""Billy Most"" a misunderstood, troubled, cross dressing ex-con, who misguidedly obsesses over yearning to birth, suckle, nurture and rear his own progeny. Yet, due to obvious gender issues, is rendered incapable and sublimates by kidnapping a young Black boy to call his own.The missing boy however has attachments to a community of teen youths, led by H.J. ""Ahmad Nurradin"" and four of his fellow ""soul brothers and one ""Good-Cop"", ""Mr. Kool"", played by Ed Bernard of ""Police Story-circa 1974"".The storyline, though choppy and mellow dramatic; offers a very real snapshot of 1970's Urban America. Big Afros, Race Based Slang, tube tops, Hip-Hugger Pants, Run-Down Shanties, Drugs, Pimps and assorted other stereotypes depicting the plight or making fun of a world left standing untouched in the wake of the 1960's Civil Rights Movement.As a jumping off point, ""Mr. Kool"" a mentor to ""The Brothers"" is brutally murdered by our antagonist, as he rescues the young boy who is subsequently rendered unable to speak. That is where our young vigilante group ""The Brothers"" band together to identify the killer and assist the police, by any means necessary.As with many movies of its day; the body of work would be considered racist, politically incorrect and possibly written off as bad cinema. Yet its cast of mostly unknowns, juxtaposed to a decaying industrial quadrant of 1970's Galveston, Texas actually works. Barry White issues a one and only sound track. Raw, and very indicative of the times.
Citizen Kane, Shaft, Blackula, Super Fly, no! But, it has a plot, the over-riding theme is Over-Coming, not being overtaken by the environment, and for a 1974 audience starved for young Blacks out to help themselves by helping each other, it provides a nice little snack. This work may be hard to find, but if you can, check it out.See it several times and remember.

A small southern town has just been rocked by a tragedy: a young woman has been violently raped. The white town fathers immediately declare that the attacker had to be black, and place the blame on Garth, a young black man. Assuming that the men in white sheets aren't intent on holding a fair and impartial trial, Garth takes to the woods as the Klansmen lynching party hunts him down.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> After breaking up a group of white locals who are attacking an African American couple for sport, an Atoka County, Alabama, sheriff named Track Bascomb (Lee Marvin) visits landowner Breck Stancill (Richard Burton) to ask if organizers for the upcoming African American voter registration demonstration will be permitted to stay on his property. Sheriff Bascomb reports that townspeople are suspicious of Stancill's liberal beliefs, but Stancill expresses resentment toward the community for imposing their prejudices.Later that evening, on a nearby country road, a local couple named Bobby and Nancy Poteet have car trouble, and Nancy is raped by an unseen man when Bobby goes to town for a spare tire. Meanwhile, Mayor Hardy Riddle (David Huddleston) leads a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) meeting. Although the Klansmen want to use violence to prevent African Americans from participating in the voter registration demonstration, Hardy discourages murder and church burning. However, the mayor rails against the ""Communist"" agitators who are coming to town to meddle with local politics. Just then, Hardy receives news that Nancy was raped and the Klansmen plan to take revenge on Willy Washington (Spence Wil-Dee), an African American whom they assume is responsible.Sometime later, Sheriff Bascomb arrests Washington at a pool hall. Although Washington's friend, Garth (O.J. Simpson), attempts to fight the sheriff, Washington leaves with Bascomb when a gang of rifle-toting Klansmen pull up in a truck; Washington claims that he feels safer in police custody. Later that evening, the Klansmen take their aggression out on Garth and his friend Henry, who is shot dead while Garth gets away.The next day in jail, Washington tells Bascomb that he is innocent. Meanwhile, Stancill meets his African American friend, Loretta Sykes (Lola Falana), at the bus stop. Loretta has returned from Chicago, Illinois, to visit her ailing grandmother who lives rent-free on Stancill's property, but locals suspect that Loretta is involved with the voter registration demonstration. One day, Loretta is visited by civil rights organizers Rev. Josh Franklin (Robert Porter) and Charles Peck (Gary Catus), who recruit her into the movement. As she shows the men around Stancill's land, she points out a tree where Stancill's grandfather was hung by Klansmen for assisting African Americans.That night, Garth avenges Henry's murder by disguising himself in a Klansman's robe and shooting the red-robed Grand Wizard dead at a KKK rally.At the police station the next day, Bascomb evades questions from reporters and learns that Bobby Poteet is leaving town in shame over the violation of his wife by an African American. Later, Bascomb escorts Nancy Poteet from a church service, where she is shunned by the community. The sheriff convinces Stancill to host Nancy at his home so she will be safely removed from town, but Mayor Hardy warns Bascomb that he will not be re-elected sheriff if he continues his alliance with Stancill.Sometime later, Garth opens fire at the funeral of the Grand Wizard, provoking a gunfight and a car accident where several Klansmen are killed and wounded. Deputy Butt Cutt Cates (Cameron Mitchell) and the Klansmen raid Loretta's home, searching for Garth. Cates detains Loretta for conspiring with ""Communists"" and punishes her with rape.Meanwhile, Stancill dines at Bascomb's home and the sheriff warns his friend that his life is at stake if he continues to defy the KKK. When Bascomb later discovers Loretta raped and bleeding to death, he insists that she make a false report of the incident before taking her to the hospital to protect the integrity of his department. Although Loretta tells the doctor that she was violated by a group of African American men, she confesses to Stancill that Bascomb asked her to lie.Sometime later, at the voter registration demonstration, Garth kills another Klansman with a sniper shot and gets away undetected by hiding in Stancill's jeep. As Stancill drives Loretta home from the hospital, she reports her intention stay in town to prevent other women from being raped and Garth surprises them in the backseat. Garth holds Stancill at gunpoint and claims that African Americans will only achieve equality with an armed revolution, but Loretta says that his violent protests are ineffective. As Garth runs into the woods, he invites Stancill and Loretta to join his fight. Returning home, Stancill discovers that the Klansmen have killed his dog; he is comforted by Nancy and they make love.That evening, at the police station, Bascomb is held at gunpoint by the Klansmen, including Deputy Cates, who demand access to Willy Washington so they can lynch him. However, a young woman named Mrs. Shaneyfelt (Eve Christopher) shows up to exonerate Washington, claiming that she was with him the night of Nancy's rape, and her Klansman husband attacks her. Bascomb then goes to Garth's home, accusing him of Nancy's rape and the killings of KKK members, and orders Garth to leave town.Meanwhile, Stancill proposes marriage to Nancy, but the young woman wants to leave Atoka County and Stancill takes her to the bus station. There, the couple is confronted by Cates, but Nancy throws herself at the deputy and Stancill knocks him out before bidding his lover farewell.Sometime later, Mayor Hardy warns Stancill that the Klansmen will soon go after him, but claims that Stancill can save himself by evicting Loretta and other African Americans who live on his property. When Stancill refuses, Hardy alerts Bascomb to the attack, and the sheriff heads to Bascomb's property. As warning sirens are sounded by Stancill's tenants, Klansmen file from their cars and set fire to the surroundings with torches and burning crosses, but Bascomb announces that Stancill has agreed to leave the county and orders the men to give up their weapons. When Cates removes his hood, Bascomb calls out his intent to arrest the deputy for the rape of Loretta and charges the other men with violating the Constitution. However, Cates fires at Bascomb, prompting a gun battle that leaves Stancill dead.Garth arrives at the scene and aims his gun at a dying KKK member, but Bascomb prevents him from firing and places him under arrest. While Bascomb radios for help, Cates shoots the sheriff dead and takes over control of the KKK. Cates and the rest of the Klansmen proceed to kill Garth and all of the African Americans on the scene.In the aftermath of the massacre, the Klansmen have departed. Loretta appears and sets fire to the tree from which Stancill's grandfather was hanged."

Insurance investigator Maindrian Pace and his team lead double-lives as unstoppable car thieves. When a South American drug lord pays Pace to steal 48 cars for him, all but one, a 1973 Ford Mustang, are in the bag. As Pace prepares to rip-off the fastback, codenamed ""Eleanor"", in Long Beach, he is unaware that his boss has tipped off the police after a business dispute. Detectives are waiting and pursue Pace through five cities as he desperately tries to get away.—Paul Morris Insurance company investigator Maindrian Pace arrives at the scene of a train wreck and an indemnity agent asks him to examine the truck that provoked the collision. Sometime later, at Chase Laboratory Insurance Research & Investigation Service, Pace's office and garage in Carson, California, mechanic Atlee Jackson explains Pace's illicit switch-over business to Stanley Chase, as they dissemble a junked Dodge Challenger. Atlee says that the company removes the serial number, engine, license plates and transmission from wrecked vehicles, then steals another car exactly like it. To cover their tracks, Pace's men embed the serial number, engine and other salvaged gear from the junked vehicle into the stolen car.Later that day, Villas, a foreign gangster, offers Pace $400,000 to procure a list of 48 luxury vehicles by the end of the week. Villas gives Pace $200,000 upfront and warns about dire consequences if he fails to deliver. After explaining his plan to Atlee, Pace flies to Dunkirk, New York, where he and his girlfriend and Stanley's younger sister, Pumpkin, attend the German-themed wedding of their older brother, Eugene. Pace heads the Chase family's covert business, but when Atlee calls to warn that stealing forty-eight cars, including nine Rolls Royces, seven limousines and race car driver Parnelli Jones's custom Ford Bronco all in four days, is impossible, Pace insists that Eugene postpone his honeymoon to help their operation, much to his disappointment.Returning to his office in Carson, Pace gives his team, whom include, Stanley, Eugene, Pumpkin, Atlee as well as Pace's brother, Corlis, a list of cars, along with the addresses of their owners. Pace makes sure the cars are insured so the owners will be compensated for their losses. Outfitting the men with disguises and briefcases stocked with the car theft tools, Pace sends the men out for the evening, hoping to procure a number of the requested vehicles. At a car race, Corlis goes after driver Bill Englehart's Rolls Royce while Pace steals a mustard yellow 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1 code-named Eleanor. Although the Mustang's drunken owner gives chase in his second car, the police soon follow the man. The owner claims to the police the vehicle was stolen and the officers drive him home, only to discover the Mustang in his garage.Back at the office, Eugene is irate about the situation, but Pace explains that he returned the car because he found the owner's business card in the sun shade, as the car belongs to the head of a corrupt insurance company and Pace relishes the chance to make the man look foolish. Meanwhile, Pumpkin calls limousines to different locations around town so Pace's men can steal them. The next day, Eugene complains that the Dodge Challenger Pace recently turned over was spotted at a used car lot, and when Pace retrieves the vehicle with a tow truck, he is chased away by security officer. However, Pace gets away after a wild chase and drops the car off at a wrecking yard. Back in his role as an insurance investigator, Pace meets with an indemnity broker, who reports the recent string of car thefts.

Soon thereafter, Pace acquires all of the cars on Villas's list, but Pumpkin informs him that the ""Eleanor"" Mustang is uninsured, and Pace promises to return it so the owner will not be harmed. As Pace recoups the Mustang, Eugene seeks revenge on Pace by anonymously calling the police and revealing the location of the replacement ""Eleanor."" When Pace steals the new ""Eleanor,"" he is chased by a squadron of police cars through Long Beach, California, inciting a media frenzy in a long and climatic car chase sequence.As the chase continues through Los Angeles, dozens of police and civilian vehicles are destroyed and police helicopters and fire trucks are deployed.

Daisy Miller,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071385/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In this comedy of manners, Frederick Winterbourne tries to figure out the bright and bubbly Daisy Miller, only to be helped and hindered by false judgments from their fellow friends. It's the late nineteenth century. Annie Miller, more regularly referred to as Daisy, of Schenectady, New York, is on a grand tour of Europe with her mother, Mrs. Ezra Miller, her precocious adolescent brother, Randolph Miller, and their manservant, Eugenio. It is at their stop in Vevey, Switzerland that Daisy meets Frederick Winterbourne, an American expat studying in Geneva. Frederick has mixed emotions about Daisy. On the one hand, he is captivated by her beauty. On the other, he believes her to be uneducated and improper in her modern American attitude and behavior, she basically doing whatever she wants regardless of the possible perception of impropriety by those in Frederick's social circle. That latter view is shared by Frederick's aunt, Mrs. Costello, with who he is traveling. Conversely, Daisy finds Frederick to be stiff. Regardless, Daisy does allow Frederick to spend time with her as they move from Vevey to Rome, Italy in their individual parallel travels. Through this time, Frederick becomes more torn about Daisy, especially as she is not averse to flirting with Mr. Giovanelli, who she meets in Rome, she preferring to walk on the arms of both Giovanelli and Frederick at the same time in public. That torn feeling is exacerbated by the talk of others, especially judgmental Mrs. Walker who is not averse to using her social standing to exert her will on others. That mixed feeling is also in that Frederick is unaware if Daisy's behavior is truly and knowingly improper and hurtful to those around her, or if she is only an innocent in her joie de vivre. He may ultimately get his answer, but by that time it may be too late for him to express his true feelings for her in return.—Huggo In this version of Henry James' novella ""Daisy Miller"", a young, bright and bubbly 19th Century American girl on her Grand Tour of Europe meets a fellow American, Frederick Winterbourne. Winterbourne is shocked by Daisy's modern behavior toward life, and spends his time with her trying to figure out if she's having innocent fun or on the path to becoming a fallen woman. Along the way, Winterbourne's judgment is helped and hindered by the other people in Daisy's life. Is Daisy really naive or naughty?—Rebecca J. Burke In Vevey, Switzerland, Randolph C. Miller, a young American boy, runs around a hotel by himself. On the outdoor patio, he asks another American, Frederick Winterbourn, for a lump of sugar. When Annie P. Miller, known as ""Daisy,"" saunters onto the patio carrying a parasol, Randolph identifies her as his older sister. Frederick engages Daisy in conversation and learns that she and Randolph are from upstate New York, and plan to visit Italy after their stay in Switzerland. Daisy chats nonstop, hardly allowing Frederick time to respond to her questions. They make plans to visit Chillon, a nearby castle. Later, Frederick's aunt, Mrs. Costello, tells him that the Miller family are not well-mannered. She criticizes Daisy and her mother's familiarity with their European courier, Eugenio, and suspects they may even dine with him. Frederick tells her about the plans he made to go to Chillon with Daisy, and she reprimands him. After dinner at the hotel, Frederick finds Daisy on the patio. Based on Frederick's description of his aunt, Daisy suspects she disapproves of her but tells him not to worry. When Daisy introduces her mother to Frederick and mentions their upcoming date, Mrs. Miller drones on, in the same manner as her daughter, about her reasons for not visiting the castle. As in conversation with Daisy, Frederick finds it difficult to interrupt. Daisy begs Frederick to take her out on a boat, but Mrs. Miller does not approve. Eugenio arrives and, at Mrs. Miller's command, forbids Daisy to go on the boat. Daisy leaves with her mother and Eugenio, telling Frederick she hopes the disappointment doesn't keep him awake. One morning, Frederick and Daisy run to catch the ferryboat heading to Chillon. At the castle, Frederick tells her he went to school in Geneva as a boy and has lived in Europe ever since. After he recites a poem, Daisy decides he would be a good teacher for Randolph and suggests he accompany her family to Italy, but he declines, saying he must return to Geneva. Agitated by the rejection, Daisy storms outside where Frederick catches up to her. She demands to know if he has a romantic interest in Geneva but Frederick denies it. Calming down, she asks him to meet her when her family is in Rome, and he agrees. Sometime later, Frederick visits his aunt at her new apartment in Rome. She supplies him with gossip about Daisy, namely that she has been associating with an Italian gentleman. Frederick attends a tea party at the home of Mrs. Walker, and encounters Daisy there. The hostess is irritated as Daisy flirts with Frederick and urges him to escort her to her next destination. Soon after, Mrs. Walker spies from a nearby carriage as Frederick and Daisy meet her Italian friend, Mr. Giovanelli, in a park. The trio walk, arm in arm, with Daisy in the middle. Mrs. Walker sends a messenger to Frederick who goes to her carriage, where she informs him that Daisy is embarrassing herself and should come to the carriage at once. Daisy comes over with Giovanelli and introduces him, but Mrs. Walker orders her into the carriage, saying her reputation is in danger as long as she stays out with the two men. Daisy refuses and asks Frederick what he thinks, and he agrees with Mrs. Walker. Peeved, Daisy leaves with Giovanelli. Mrs. Walker insists Frederick get into the carriage. As they drive away, she tells him everyone in town is talking about Daisy and her reckless behavior. Frederick agrees that Daisy's family seems tasteless, but insists that he likes her regardless. Disappointed, Mrs. Walker allows Frederick to leave the carriage and rejoin Daisy and Giovanelli. Before he catches up to them, however, Giovanelli spots him and uses Daisy's parasol to block Frederick's view. One night, Mrs. Miller arrives at Mrs. Walker's home for a party, apologizes that her daughter is late, and explains that she has been singing and playing piano with Giovanelli at their hotel. Later, Daisy and her Italian suitor arrive, and she insists that he sing for Mrs. Walker's guests. While Giovanelli performs, Frederick finds Daisy and warns her that her actions are improper, saying that flirting is an American custom, unacceptable in European society. Daisy rejects his advice and reunites with Giovanelli after his performance. When Daisy departs with her mother and Giovanelli, Mrs. Walker ignores their goodbyes, telling Frederick that Daisy will never be invited to her home again. Frederick later visits Daisy at her hotel and notices two bellboys snickering at him, assuming he's another of her many suitors. Frederick runs into his aunt, and they observe Daisy walking with Giovanelli. His aunt again discourages Frederick from associating with her. One day, at the Millers' hotel suite, Frederick visits with Daisy and Giovanelli, who are at the piano, playing ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" Giovanni plays a song for Daisy to sing, and Frederick watches, mesmerized. Mrs. Miller returns home and mentions her suspicion that Daisy might be engaged to Giovanelli, and Frederick abruptly leaves. One day, Daisy finds Frederick walking alone and joins him. He informs her that Mrs. Miller mentioned a possible engagement, and Daisy teases him by saying she is engaged and, moments later, denying it. In a carriage at night, Frederick confides to his friend, Charles, that he cannot decide whether Daisy is reckless or exceedingly naive. Despondent, he leaves the carriage and walks home. On his way, he passes through the Colosseum and runs into Daisy and Giovanelli. He reprimands Giovanelli for bringing her there, as it is a breeding ground for the Roman flu. Frederick criticizes Daisy's lack of prudence, and she leaves in a huff. At the opera, Frederick overhears a group of women gossiping about Daisy and learns that she has caught the Roman flu. Soon after, Frederick visits the Millers' hotel suite. Mrs. Miller complains that Giovanelli has disappeared since Daisy became ill and says that Daisy wanted Frederick to know she is definitely not engaged. Sometime later, Frederick mourns alongside Giovanelli, Mrs. Miller, and Randolph at Daisy's funeral. Giovanelli tells Frederick that Daisy was the most innocent girl he knew but admits she never would have married him. Frederick later expresses to his aunt that he regrets the manner in which he treated Daisy."

Blood for Dracula,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071233/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ailing vampire count travels to Italy with his servant to find a bride. Udo Kier is without a doubt the sickliest of vampires in any director's interpretation of the Bram Stoker tale. Count Dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced ""wirgin's""] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR virgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count. It's a race for Dracula to discover who's the real virgin, before he either dies from malnourishment or from the wooden stake of the Communist!—Jonathan Dakss <dakss@columbia.edu> In Transilvania, Count Dracula is weak and ill since he needs the blood of virgin girls to recover. His servant Mario Balato suggests him to travel the Italy, a Catholic country were virginity is preserved to marriage, with his coffin. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the Di Fiore family is completely broken and has four virgin daughters. Mario contacts the Marquee Di Fiore and his greedy wife invites them to stay in their manor and introduces their daughter Esmeralda, Saphiria, Rubiniaand Perla. Soon Dracula finds that Saphiria and Rubinia are not pure since they are lovers of the Marquee's servant Anton. Meanwhile Anton suspects that Dracula is a vampire.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Shot immediately after production on Flesh for Frankenstein has finished, and using the same main actors, Morrissey's Andy Warhol-sponsored take on Dracula is no less weird, although in many ways it may be the better film, though it's less over the top. Instead of the weird Doctor Frankenstein, we get Dracula as a sort of aging silent film star a la Valentino, dyeing his hair black and moping around in outrageous costumes, and that's before we get to the most literal take I've seen on the ""vampires as aristocrats sucking the working classes dry"" metaphor seen, with Joe Dallesandro playing a literal Marxist farmhand who is the only one to realize the threat of Dracula, in between sleeping with his employers' daughters. It's weird, campy, and not exactly good, but it's fascinating to watch, and Udo Kier's all-in performance as a sickly vampire confined to a wheelchair for lack of virgin blood is kind of mesmerizing. Count Dracula is dying, since there are no virgins left for him to feed on, and he leaves his sister, who is even worse off (and is never mentioned again) in the castle's crypt before leaving Romania for Italy, where his manservant has convinced him there are more virgins available, since ""it's a very Catholic country"". At their arrival, they're quickly put in touch with the Di Fiore family, whose patriarch, the Marchese Di Fiore, has gambled away most of the family fortune, but whose four daughters are all supposed to be virgins and available for marriage. However, it turns out the two daughters that are of appropriate age are having lots and lots of sex with the estate's farmhand, who is also an avowed Socialist who rails against the family and the upper classes in general, and while the family is either oblivious or gradually being seduced by Dracula, he might be the only one who can stop the threat.—radegeddon Count Dracula [Udo Kier] and his renfield Anton [Arno Juerging] travel to Italy in search of a virgin's blood. They are invited to stay at the di Fiori estate where there are four unmarried girls. Perhaps the Count will choose one of them? Highly unlikely. The two middle girls -- Rubina [Stefania Casini] and Saphiris [Dominique Darel] --are screwing the hired hand Mario [Joe Dallesandro]. Dracula drinks their blood and promptly throws up. Mario gets wise to the vampire and rapes the youngest girl Perla [Silvia Dionisio] so she won't be of interest. The oldest girl Esmerelda [Milena Vukotic] is still a virgin and gives herself to Dracula. Dracula is staked by Mario after Mario chops off both Dracula's arms, one leg and few other parts. Esmerelda throws herself on the stake, too."

McQ greets Kosterman in the station commissary and he orders McQ not to harass Santiago, pointedly reminding him of a previous case where McQ brutally assaulted a hood and the police had to deal with backlash from several lawyers. He blows Kosterman off and drives to the shipyard, where he photographs Santiago greeting a suspicious type just before he drives to a downtown restaurant pub. It is there that a local news broadcast reveals that Boyle died of his shotgun injuries. When Santiago goes to the restroom and uses a payphone to inform someone of Boyle's death, McQ jumps him, rams him head-first into the mirror, punches him unconscious, and dumps him in a trough.Because of numerous complaining phone calls to the station, McQ s assigned to desk work until further notice by police brass, but instead of taking the punishment, McQ angrily quits the force, despite Toms coaxing him not to, though he gives J.C. the roll of film on Santiago and tells him to get an identification on the suspect with him. Several days later, following Boyle's funeral, Lois comes by McQ's houseboat where he comforts her and she suggests they should go away together to Canada on a vacation. Later, McQ shows up at the office of Pinky Farrell, a private detective, and asks to join him as he wants to investigate Boyle's murder and Santiago's supposed role in it and not be held up by the police umbrella. Though it could get him into trouble with the authorities, Pinky agrees to register McQ and, at police headquarters, J.C. gives him the photos he took, identifying the man with Santiago as Freddie LaSalle, a hired hit-man from St. Louis. Later, McQ later borrows $5,000 from his ex-wife Elaine and has a bittersweet face-to-face with his teenage daughter Ginger.That night, at a Seattle Supersonics game, McQ confronts Rosey, an informant/pimp who wants nothing to do with McQ. He shows Rosey a newspaper with some of the $5,000 and Rosey tells him that Santiago has brought in three nationwide hit-men for a drug heist. Later, McQ greets cocktail waitress Myra, who was an informant of Boyle and may have been closer to him that just that. She agrees to tell him that she knows about Santiago's hit team and that they intend to steal from the police. The next morning, McQ follows a state police detail van transferring several million dollars worth of powder to an incineration plant at a local hospital, but Santiago's hit team, disguised as laundrymen, jumps them, steal the powder, and shoot at McQ as he pursues them to their laundry truck. Lon chases them around the city and finally corners the truck, but turns out to be a different one, as well as its driver. At the police station, Kosterman is doubly furious at McQ for the shootout, his inability to inform the police beforehand, as well as Toms, who defends McQ and Kosterman also revokes McQ's gun permit.McQ for his part, purchases another gun anyway, then is told by his friend, the gun shop owner, about a new sub-machine weapon invented by the U.S. Army, the Ingram, a 9mm weapon that fires 20 rounds per second. McQ is so impressed with the Ingram, after test firing it on a trashcan of water, he borrows the weapon and half a dozen magazines of ammo, even though the Ingram is not yet a licensed weapon. He then drives to Lois' house for a drink, where Toms also stops, for a visit, and warns McQ to lay low because he is already on thin ice with Kosterman and the police department. He then receives a phone call from J.C. that the search turned up nothing. McQ though knows better and that Santiago has driven the junk around before hiding it in his office where the police already searched. Yet it blows up in McQ's face when he finds the powder stashed in Santiago's office, cornered by his henchmen, and learns from a furious Santiago that the powder he stole is, in fact, powdered sugar, as the drugs were switched with by certain officials, and now McQ realizes Santiago never was involved in the killing of Boyle or the other two officers. Santiago, with nothing to fear, lets McQ go, but decides to beat him up as revenge.McQ now suspects Kosterman may be involved in the killings, but gets more shocking news when he confronts Rosey at a nightclub and reveals that Boyle was a dirty cop. McQ initially does not believe it, but does so when he discovers Myra was shot to death by one of Santiago's men, who thinks she knows something. Soon after, McQ himself is attacked in an alley, where two semi-trucks crush his car to oblivion. He is taken to a hospital for X-rays, where J.C. tells him they took his car to the impound lot. Lon now realizes something about his car and he sneaks into the yard to retrieve the Ingram and finds traces of cocaine, the same kind that was switched with sugar earlier. McQ now realizes his partner was indeed dirty, but when he notices J.C., Kosterman, and a few other detectives showing up, he is suspected of the drug deal and hot-wires a police car to escape. The next morning, he goes to Lois' house, who has her bags packed to visit her folks out of town. McQ drives with her out of the city, reveals her husband was dirty, and suspects that Lois may have the cocaine hidden in one of the suitcases. He then notices a car tailing them and tells Lois to turn off onto a dirt road leading to the beach. The man gets out and starts shooting at their car, but McQ shoots back and kills him. They notice the gunman was actually Toms, who, too, was in cohorts with Boyle.As they retreat back to their car, two more show up, with Santiago in one of them. McQ leads the pursuing vehicles on a chase down the beach. When the gunmen start to shoot up Lois' car, McQ quickly pulls out the Ingram and opens fire, causing their car to roll over several times. McQ and Santiago's cars pull over and he orders McQ to give him the suitcase of cocaine. He throws it near Santiago's car and tells his bodyguard to get it. However, one of the surviving henchmen, in the damaged car, tries to take McQ out with a shotgun, but is killed, as well as the bodyguard, and Santiago. McQ then walks over and opens the suitcase and the cocaine is dissolved by the ocean water. As the local police and ambulances arrive, Lois is forced to turn herself in and drove off by officers. Kosterman and J.C. are also at the scene, who apologize for suspecting McQ all along. Thinking there is only one way to bury the hatchet, McQ leads them to a nearby bar for a drink."

Armed with his brute strength and ace cool partner (Alan Weeks), Truck closes in on his mark. But a tragic accident soon changes all the rules, and suddenly the hunter finds himself being hunted by the city's deadliest hired killers. Truck strikes back in a series of wild car chases, shootouts and bone-crunching fistfights, knowing that the battles can lead to only one place: an intense struggle to the death against Harvard Blue (Kotto), the brutal leader of L.A.'s organized crime syndicate. In Los Angeles, California, African-American bounty hunter ""Mack Truck"" Turner and his partner, Jerry, drive to a U.S. Air Force base in search of Garrity, a rapist who has skipped trial after being released on bail. When the guards do not allow them on the base, Truck drives his car through the gate and captures Garrity. After delivering him to the authorities, Truck visits Annie, his girlfriend and a petty thief who is also incarcerated. Later, at a courthouse, a lawyer named Fogarty asks Truck and Jerry to track down a pimp who has defaulted on a $30,000 bail. The pimp's name is Richard Leroy ""Gator"" Johnson, and he has a violent criminal record; thus, Truck and Jerry demand more money for the job. Once Fogarty agrees to pay them $1,000 each, Truck and Jerry go to a beauty salon in search of Gator's prostitutes. There, Truck speaks to Dorinda, an accomplice of Gator's who refuses to provide any information.

After a car chase through the city, the pursuit continues on foot, and Gator escapes. Truck and Jerry receive word from a retired criminal named Duke that someone named Harvard Blue is also looking for Gator, since he stole Blue's girlfriend, a buxom blonde named Stalingrad Cruise. Soon after, Truck and Jerry track down a drug dealer friend of Gator's and force him to call the pimp, saying he has a new batch of drugs. However, the man warns Gator, and a gunfight ensues between Gator, Truck and Jerry. They shoot Gator dead, but Stalingrad runs out of the house and stabs Jerry with a pair of scissors, prompting Truck to knock her out with one punch. After Fogarty pays them their fees, Truck and Jerry unwind over some drinks. Truck is late to pick up Annie who has been released from prison, but she forgives him as they return to his apartment and make love.

After these initial failures, Blue meets with Dorinda and tells her he will kill Truck in exchange for half of Gator's share of the profits from the prostitution ring. Blue arranges for a $100,000 life insurance policy on Truck with a corrupt insurance broker, so that they can collect the payout once he is dead. However, in their first attempt to ambush Truck, they accidentally kill Jerry instead. Truck goes to the hospital to see Nate Dinwiddie, who was beaten by Blue's men in their pursuit of Truck. Returning home, Truck and Annie find his apartment ransacked and his beloved cat, Francis, hanged by the neck.

Phantom of the Paradise,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071994/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A disfigured composer sells his soul for the woman he loves so that she will perform his music. However, an evil record tycoon betrays him and steals his music to open his rock palace, The Paradise. Evil record tycoon Swan has sold his soul to the devil for eternal youth and success - 20 years ago. Swan's current scheme is to steal the music from composer Winslow Leach to celebrate the opening of his rock palace, The Paradise. While trying to stop Swan, Leach was framed and convicted for drug dealing, and becomes the victim of a freak accident that leaves him horribly disfigured. He takes refuge in the cavernous Paradise, hiding his mangled face beneath an eerie mask and planning gruesome vengeance upon Swan - and everyone else who has hurt him. However, Leach signs a contract with Swan to complete his rock opera based on the legend of Faust for an aspiring singer - Phoenix.—Max Davison Swan is a powerful and mysterious impresario who both steals a rock cantata from Winslow Leach and frames him for a crime he didn't commit. Now with a desire for vengeance, Winslow plots revenge and haunts the Paradise, Swan's lavish new rock club. Rock opera version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with elements of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and the legend of Faust. Evil record producer Swan steals both the singer (Phoenix) and the music from composer Winslow Leach. With a mutilated face covered by a silver owl-like mask, he searches for other ways to have his revenge. However, Leach signs a contract with Swan to complete his rock opera based on the life of Faust only for Phoenix. Betrayed by Swan, who hires glam-rock singer Beef as the lead singer of this rock opera, Leach exacts his vengeance. However, Leach discovers the dark secret of his contract: Swan has sold his soul to the devil for eternal youth - 20 years ago.—R. Kessen <rhkessen@cs.vu.nl> Winslow Leach (William Finley) is an up-and-coming songwriter and composer who is seen by satanic record producer Swan (Paul Williams) during his performance as a back-up act to the nostalgia band The Juicy Fruits, whom Swan produces. Swan is deeply moved by Winslow's song and deemed Winslow's music as the perfect music to open ""The Paradise"", Swan's highly anticipated new concert hall. Swan sends his loyal right-hand man Arnold Philbin (George Memmoli) to steal Winslow's song and claim it as his own. When Winslow arrives at Death Records, Swan's record label, he is thrown out.Winslow sneaks into Swan's private mansion, ""The Swanage"", to find out what's going on, he observes several women all rehearsing his music for an audition. One of them is an aspiring singer, Phoenix (Jessica Harper), whom Winslow deems perfect for his music and the two quickly fall for each other. Winslow is told of Swan's plan to open the Paradise with Winslow's music. When Winslow sneaks in once more, Swan orders he be thrown out again and for his minions to beat up Winslow and frame him for drug dealing. Winslow is given a life sentence (from more of Swan's manipulation of the legal system) and is sent to Sing Sing Prison. Winslow's teeth are extracted and now replaced with shiny metal ones as part of an experimental prisoner program funded by the Swan Foundation.Six months later, Winslow hears on the radio, while assembling tiddlywinks games in the prison rehab center, that The Juicy Fruits, whom he hates, have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan's backing. Winslow goes berserk, punches out a guard and escapes from prison in a delivery box driven off prison property. He breaks into the Death Records building and tears the place up. He then breaks into Swan's record factory where he sets out to destroy a record press. When a guard catches him fiddling with the record press, Winslow slips and the record press catches his sleeve, tumbling him head first into the record press which crushes and burns his face and destroys his vocal cords. Bleeding profusely and with his face now severely mutilated, a disoriented Winslow makes his way to the edge of the East River and tumbles into the water. The newspaper reports the details of the night and that his body was not recovered.Sneaking into the Paradise, Winslow makes his way into the costume department where he dons a black leather costume, a long black cape (though he also wears a red one later in the movie) and a silver owl-like mask to cover his now deformed face, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise so he can terrorize Swan and his musicians. In a musical split-screen sequence, Winslow plants a time bomb on a prop convertible during a musical act and nearly kills The Beach Bums (formerly The Juicy Fruits, who have traded doo-wop for surf music). Seeing the Phantom on a security camera, Swan realizes there is an intruder about.The Phantom confronts Swan, who recognizes him as Winslow and offers the composer the chance to have his music produced his way. Auditions are held and the Phantom selects Phoenix for the lead. Later, in a secluded recording studio in the basement of the building, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing (with the voice of Paul Williams). Swan orders the Phantom to stop terrorizing the Paradise and rewrite his cantata for Phoenix. The Phantom reluctantly agrees on the condition that Phoenix is the lead singer and that Swan plays ""what I write!"" Swan promises and the Phantom signs a contract in blood.Swan is later shown bitterly listening to the recording session with Winslow: while he sounded normal at the time, the tapes mysterious play back Swan's voice as ragged, wicked and monstrous-sounding. While the Phantom remains in the recording studio rewriting his cantata, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix's perfection for the lead role: ""You know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself."" Swan replaces Phoenix with pill-popping, male glam-rock prima donna Beef (Gerrit Graham) in the lead of Winslow's Faust and moves Phoenix for the role of backup singer. Beef is revealed to the media at a press conference where all cameras and recording devices are strictly banned, as per Swan's policy.After days of isolation, the Phantom completes Faust, Swan having gotten him hooked on uppers in the process. Swan steals the completed cantata while ordering his minions to seal up the Phantom inside the recording studio with a brick wall. However, when the Phantom awakens that night and realizes he has been betrayed again, he manages to escape with deadly fury and kills Swan's guards. The Phantom then confronts Beef (in a comic allusion to the infamous shower scene in Psycho (1960)) and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is stopped by Philbin outside the building, who suggests to Beef that this was all a drug-induced hallucination.Onstage, the glam-rock band The Undeads (the former Juicy Fruits/the Beach Bums), costumed to resemble the somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), perform of the ultimate man, appearing to dismember audience members (actually planted actors with dummy limbs) and making a show of appearing to turn the parts into Beef, now costumed as a glitter-clad Frankenstein's monster. As Beef performs a completely rewritten glam-rock version of Winslow's song ""Old Souls"", hidden in the rafters, the Phantom strikes and electrocutes Beef with a lightning-bolt-shaped neon sign (to the great delight of the crowd).Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage as a replacement. Singing the slow true version of Winslow's music at last, Phoenix is an immediate sensation with the audience. As they continue to cheer for Beef outside as his dead body is loaded into an ambulance, Swan now realizes the potential of the situation. In Phoenix's dressing room, Swan arrives and seduces Phoenix after the show with promises of her future stardom. As she leaves, she is nearly overwhelmed by the zealous crowd, but is quickly spirited away by the Phantom. On the roof, the Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity and what Swan has done. He implores Phoenix to leave the Paradise so Swan won't destroy her like he has destroyed everything else. Fearing the Phantom, Phoenix does not believe him and escapes.At the Swanage, the Phantom secretly observes Swan and Phoenix locked in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he commits suicide by stabbing himself through the heart with his Bowie knife. However, the Phantom awakens from death and sees Swan standing over him. Pulling the knife out, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die because he's locked to the blood contract he had signed earlier: The Phantom cannot die until Swan himself has died. With that knowledge, the Phantom attempts to stab Swan through the heart, but Swan is unharmed and merely pulls the knife away. Looking down at the Phantom, Swan hisses in an almost reptilian voice, ""I'm under contract, too!""Rolling Stone announces the upcoming wedding between Swan and Phoenix during Faust's finale. While everyone prepares, the Phantom sneaks into Swan's private taping room to watch the tape containing the blood contract. Watching the tape, the Phantom then learns that Swan made a pact with the devil over 20 years ago (1953): Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed. Future photos, videos and recordings of Swan will age and fester in his place, explaining why he abhors being caught on film. The tape goes on to reveal footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and finally a new one Swan made with Phoenix when she was stoned, promising him ""her voice"" upon her death (presumably to finally overcome Swan's voice's wretched sound when recorded, as per his own contract). On a live television camera, the Phantom observes an assassin assembling a rifle and realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. The Phantom destroys most of the recordings by setting them on fire and heads off to the wedding between Swan and Phoenix.The wedding is in full swing onstage, with Philbin officiating and Swan wearing gloves and a silver mask of his own face to prevent being properly filmed. The Phantom manages to throw off the assassin's aim to stop him from hitting Phoenix, causing him to shoot and kill Philbin instead. With the tapes destroyed and Swan now mortal once again, the Phantom swings down onto the stage and rips off Swan's mask, finally exposing him as a monster on live television. Swan's face is now hideous, burning away like the tapes and contracts. Realizing what's happening, a crazed Swan gropes for Phoenix's throat, demanding she give him her voice, beginning to strangle her. The Phantom intervenes and stabs Swan repeatedly in the chest with the metal beak of a backup dancer's bird-shaped headpiece. The moment he does, his own fatal chest wound reopens.As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who are driven to the point of hysteria and join in stabbing him. The dying Winslow also removes his mask to reveal his own face, and cheered on by the crowd, crawls on the floor towards the shocked Phoenix. Just as he holds out a hand to her, Swan dies, allowing Winslow to die of his own wound. As Winslow succumbs, Phoenix finally recognizes him as the kind man she met in line at the Swanage. Phoenix rushes over and lies down next to him, crying and heartbroken as the audience raves.The closing credits feature a series of montages of the cast members, identifying each by name, commencing with the musical trio and concluding with Winslow/The Phantom. Most of the shots in these montages are from the movie, but there are also several from outtakes."

They also become romantically attracted to each other, in the process. Later, Kopas brings assault charges against Vince, resulting in him being placed under arrest before he can finish the harvest. In jail, Vince meets Lt. McAllen, who knows a lot about Vince's checkered past, as well as annoying fellow inmate Frank Renda, a notorious mafia hit man.

Renda orders Lundy to pull over and tells Kopas to get out, informing him that does exactly what Lundy tells him, before Renda and the others drive away.That night, Renda and his men arrive at the farm to kill Vince, but discover he is not at home. They instead rough up the hired hands, forcing them to depart, as well as shooting up the picked melons with sub-machine guns.

Vince then assaults the cabin, killing Lundy after Renda sacrifices him to save himself. Disgusted at Renda, Kopas decides to leave when he realizes Renda will also kill him, too, to get to Vince. Kopas runs out and is caught by Vince, who decides to spare Kopas' life as long as he tells where Renda is. Vince jumps through the front window and blows Renda away.

Inside Jessica is seen sitting up and watching. Dimitri collapses on the floor from exhaustion.Robert is seen approaching his car. George is waiting and wants to know why he left Jessica alone. He tells George that she is not alone; Dimitri is with her. He explains that she will remain at home and that he is convinced that Dimitri is the only one who can help her. George expresses his belief that Robert is out of his mind. Telling him that this is how it is going to be, Robert drives away.At home, Robert admits his doubts about trusting Dimitri.

The result is absolutely nothing. There are no brain waves detected. George suggests that she is already brain dead. Robert disagrees, saying that everything that Dimitri predicted is coming true.

Finally he begins removing the jacket. They embrace for a few moments.Suddenly the demon comes out and throws Robert to the wall. He calls out to Jessica, who sits and laughs maniacally as she throws him from wall to wall. Finally after jostling him around the room, Robert is thrown outside the door and lands at the feet of Dimitri. Dimitri explains how helpless Robert is trying to deal with the demon and says that tomorrow he will intervene and make sure the devil doesn't leave with the child.Meanwhile, George continues the search for Dimitri. He is directed to the waterfront where he confronts a woman on a small houseboat. She tells him she used to know Dimitri and that he was well-thought-of in some circles. They say he could heal those others could not. George asks about Jessica. She remembers that Jessica was bewitched by him, although she suggests it was the other way around. George is told that she never saw anymore of the girl after he died. She tells him Dimitri died years ago in a car crash but his body was never recovered. George says some have reported seeing him. She tells him that sometimes people come back from the past.As George is driving back, the sound of demonic laughter is heard. Dimitri is also plagued by the demon, who taunts him.

Murder on the Orient Express,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071877/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In December 1935, when his transcontinental luxury train is stranded by deep snow, detective Hercule Poirot is called on to solve a murder that occurred in his car the night before, with a multitude of suspects. The first class compartment of the December 1935 departure of the Orient Express from Istanbul is full, unusual for this time of the year. Regardless, famed and fastidious Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who needs to get back to London immediately, is able to secure last minute passage in the compartment with the assistance of his friend, Signor Bianchi, one of the directors of the train line who is also making the trip. Some of the first class passengers seem concerned about Poirot's presence on the train. At least one of them has reason to be concerned, as later, another first class passenger, who earlier in the trip asked Poirot to provide protection for him due to several death threats, is found murdered in his stateroom by multiple stabbings. At the time the victim is found, the train is unexpectedly stopped and delayed due to snow in remote Yugoslavia, which may be problematic for the murderer in getting away now that Poirot is on the case, which he is doing as a favor to Bianchi as not to get the Yugoslav police involved. Poirot quickly learns that the victim was not who he presented himself to be and has a connection to a five-year-old American kidnapping and murder case of infant Daisy Armstrong, murdered in spite of the fact that her parents had paid the requested ransom. The murderer in that case has long been convicted and executed but the ransom moneys were never recovered, a known accomplice never captured, and both the Armstrong parents have since tragically died. As Poirot questions the train's valet, the victim's accompanying staff, and the other primarily well off first class passengers and their accompanying servants, who are all on the surface more than cooperative, he finds that many had opportunity and motive, the latter which may not be obvious. There is also a great deal of evidence discovered on the train, which pulls his thoughts in many directions. These pieces of information may complicate the deduction of who is the murderer.—Huggo Dreaming of much-needed rest, renowned Belgian detective Hercule Poirot returns to London on the luxurious Orient Express. Unfortunately, however, Hercule's happiness is short-lived. As the blood of a fellow traveller stains the otherwise pleasant voyage and a massive avalanche forces the rapid locomotive to come to a halt, the moustachioed detective will have to investigate the knotty case of the brutal murder, whether he likes it or not. As a result, in a confined place where everyone is a suspect, Poirot must put his remarkable skill set to good use before the unknown killer strikes again. It seems that a strange coincidence links the remaining high-class passengers together. Will the methodical detective live up to its reputation? Can Poirot solve the mystery of the murder on the Orient Express?—Nick Riganas The Belgian detective Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express. One of the passengers requests his protection, but Poirot declines. The next day the passenger is found dead in his compartment and Poirot is asked to solve the case. The train is forced to stop due to a snow drift blocking the tracks. This gives him a few hours to figure out the murderer's identity before the local police take over the investigation. During his investigation, Poirot discovers that many of the passengers have some connection. This could be the vital clue to crack the case, but can he do it in time?—rmlohner Unexpectedly returning to England from Istanbul, famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself traveling on the Orient Express. One of the passengers informs Poirot that he has been receiving anonymous threats and asks Poirot to act as his bodyguard. Poirot declines but when he is found the next morning stabbed to death, it is apparent that the threats he received were very real. As Poirot begins to question the dozen or so passengers on the train, he realizes that several of them have a connection and he begins to form a solution to a very complex crime.—garykmcd The murderHaving sorted a matter out in the Middle East, detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. During the journey, Poirot encounters his friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which owns the line. The train is unusually crowded for the time of year: every first-class berth has been booked. Shortly after the train's departure from Istanbul, a wealthy American businessman, Ratchett (Richard Widmark), tries to secure Poirot's services for $15,000 since he has received many death threats, but Poirot finds the case of little interest and turns it down. That night the train is caught in heavy snows in the Balkans. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin.
Poirot and Bianchi work together to solve the case. They enlist the help of Dr. Constantine (George Coulouris), a Greek medical doctor who was travelling in another coach with Bianchi as the only other passenger and thus not a suspect. Pierre Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the middle-aged French conductor of the car, also assists the investigation, as well as being a suspect. Poirot soon discovers that Ratchett was not who he claimed to be. The victim's secret past indicates a clear motive for murder, even justification, but who was the killer?CluesDr. Constantine's examination of the body reveals that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times. Some wounds were slight, but at least three of them could have resulted in death.
The stopped watch in the victim's pocket, as well as Poirot's reconstructed timeline of passenger activities the night before, indicate that Ratchett was murdered at about 1:15 a.m. The train had stopped, surrounded by fresh snow, before that time. There are no tracks in the snow and the doors to the other cars were locked, so the murderer is almost certainly still among the passengers in the coach in which Ratchett was killed.
Most importantly, Poirot realizes that Ratchett was in fact a gangster called Cassetti. Five years previously, Cassetti and a henchman kidnapped and murdered Daisy Armstrong, the baby daughter of a wealthy British Army Colonel who had settled in America with his American-born wife. The body was found after the ransom had been paid. Overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labor early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby. A maidservant named Paulette who was wrongly suspected of complicity in the kidnapping committed suicide. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by these tragedies, later killed himself as well. Cassetti's accomplice was arrested and executed, but Cassetti himself fled the country with the ransom, as he was only revealed to be the leader on the eve of the execution.
Having established these facts, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and Bianchi summon the other passengers one by one and proceed to interrogate them.
(The fictitious Armstrong case was inspired by the real-life kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's child.)SuspectsThe thirteen suspects are:
Hector McQueen (Anthony Perkins), a tall, young American man, the victim's secretary and translator;
Edward Beddoes (Sir John Gielgud), the victim's British valet;
Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), a young British woman, returning home to England after working as a teacher in Baghdad;
Colonel Arbuthnott (Sean Connery), a British officer in the British Indian Army returning to England on leave;
Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller), an elderly Russian royal;
Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachel Roberts), a middle-aged German woman, the Princess' personal maid;
Count Rudolf Andrenyi (Michael York), an aristocratic Hungarian diplomat;
Countess Elena Andrenyi (Jacqueline Bisset), née Grünwald, his beautiful young wife;
Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman), a middle-aged Swedish missionary returning to Europe on a fund-raising trip for her mission in Africa;
Mrs. Harriet Belinda Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), an older, fussy, very talkative American pluri-widowed socialite;
Antonio (Gino) Foscarelli (Denis Quilley), an exuberant Italian American car salesman from Chicago;
Cyrus B. ""Dick"" Hardman (Colin Blakely), a Pinkerton's detective masquerading as a talent agent;
Pierre-Paul Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the French conductor of the sleeping car.MotivePoirot soon comes to realise that all the suspects were connected to the Armstrong family and had reason to seek revenge for the tragedies that followed the kidnapping. Some openly admit their connections to the Armstrongs, while other ties must be uncovered by Poirot.
McQueen was the son of the District Attorney who prosecuted the case and was very fond of Mrs. Armstrong;
Miss Debenham was Mrs Armstrong's secretary;
Beddoes was Colonel Armstrong's army batman and the family butler;
Col. Arbuthnott was an army friend of Col. Armstrong;
Princess Dragomiroff was Sonia Armstrong's godmother;
Miss Schmidt was the Armstrongs' cook;
Miss Ohlsson was Daisy's nursemaid;
Foscarelli was the Armstrong's chauffeur;
Hardman was, at the time, a policeman who was in love with Paulette;
Michel was Paulette's father;
Countess Andrenyi was Mrs Armstrong's sister;
Mrs Hubbard was Mrs Armstrong's mother;
Count Andrenyi was Mrs Armstrong's brother in law.
Ratchett was sedated by Beddoes and McQueen. Each of the passengers then stabbed him in turn.
Poirot presents this explanation for the murder to the assembled passengers, describing it as the ""complex"" solution to the crime. Yet he also offers another explanation, a ""simple"" one. In the course of the inquiry evidence has been found of an intruder on the train, who may have murdered Ratchett and then escaped evidence planted by the suspects. Poirot suggests that Ratchett/Cassetti may have been involved with the Mafia and murdered as the result of a feud. He leaves it to Bianchi, director of the line, to decide which explanation to present to the local police.
Bianchi decides that this ""simple"" solution will be enough for the local police and that Ratchett deserved everything he got. A cover-up is therefore instigated. Poirot is satisfied that justice has been done, though he does admit to a struggle with his conscience."

Zardoz,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070948/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the late 23rd century, a savage trained only to kill finds a way into the community of bored immortals that alone preserves humanity's achievements. 2293. Zardoz, an unseen ""God"" who speaks through an idol, a large stone statue of a head, leads a barbaric race called the Brutals, who live a harsh existence in the Outlands. Zardoz tells the Brutals that once they die, they will be transported to the Vortex, where they will live happily as immortals. He has armed a small group, the Exterminators, with guns, as Zardoz's philosophy is that killing is good, and procreation is the root of all that is bad. In reality, Zardoz is Arthur Frayn, from a competing, more advanced race, called ""the Eternals"", who live in paradise in the Vortex. The Eternals truly are immortal as they do not age and their bodies undergo reconstruction if they ""die"". As such, they truly do not believe in procreation as their society has reached perfect equilibrium. Past human acts such as sex and sleep are obsolete in their advanced state. All major decisions are achieved through pure democracy. The Eternals, however, are not immune to non life threatening disease or sin, the latter which is punishable by aging, only making their life less pleasant, but not ever killing them. Arthur's mission as Zardoz is to control, monitor, and study the Brutals for the Eternals. Being in the Outlands, Arthur is isolated without communication back to the Vortex and the Eternals. In his work as an Exterminator, Zed, by accident, is able to find his way to the Vortex as a still alive being. The Eternals vote to keep Zed alive temporarily so that they can study him before they kill him. Amongst the Eternals who have direct interactions with Zed are: May, the lead scientist, who believes Zed is a blessing in that they have not had access to a Brutal in some time; Friend, a hedonist who wants to use Zed as the animal he considers him to be; and Consuela, the hard lined one who believes in vigilante justice. In the Eternals' access to Zed, they may learn if he making it to the Vortex was indeed an accident. In addition, their so-called Utopian society may be exposed for what it truly is.—Huggo In the distant future, Earth is divided into two camps, the barely civilized group and the overly civilized one with mental powers. A plague is attacking the second group, after which its members cease to have any interest in life and become nearly catatonic. When Zed, one of the barbarians, crosses over, the tenuous balance in their world is threatened.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Brutals are told that when they die they will go to the vortex, where the Eternals live immortally. Zed, an Exterminator-class brutal who worships the stone head Zardoz, comes upon an old library where a mysterious stranger teaches him how to read. When he finds a copy of a well-known book, he sets out to learn the secret of the god he worships, and disrupts life in the vortex.—Scott Hutchins <scottandrewh@home.com> Zed is a exterminator, a savage warrior living in a post-apocalyptic future world. Like all exterminators, Zed worships a stone head called Zardoz as a god. Zardoz promises all those who worship that when they die, they will go to the Vortex, a community inhabited by immortal men and women. Zed finds himself in Zardoz's mouth and Zardoz arrives in the Vortex. Zed's arrival in the Vortex begins to cause disruption, as Zed sets out to discover the secrets of Zardoz. Where Zed encounters a stranger named Arthur Frayn in a library and Arthur teaches Zed to read and reveals Zardoz's secrets, which could bring about the fall of all life in The Vortex and lead Zed to giving the immortals, the gift of death.—Daniel Williamson The story opens with a speech made by Arthur Frayn/Zardoz (Niall Buggy) who states that he is immortal. He explains that this story ""may"" happen in the future. He is a ""fake god"" and a magician. But he is invented too, asking if the viewers of the movie themselves are part of a fiction. He asks ""Is God in show business too?""In the year 2293, the world is divided into two groups: the Brutals, and the Eternals. The Brutals live harsh and violent lives, farming crops and eking out a bare existence among the ruins of civilization, known as the Outlands. Elite among the Brutals are the Exterminators, men who have been raised to control the population by killing undesirables. These Exterminators are shown riding around on horses, worshiping a giant floating head-- the idol of their god, Zardoz. Instead of telling the faithful to be fruitful and multiply, Zardoz explains that sex is evil and that ""the penis shoots seeds and makes new life to poison the earth with a plague of men."" He commands the Exterminators to ""go forth and kill."" In furtherance of this divine decree, guns and bullets come pouring out of the mouth of Zardoz. Zed (Sean Connery) takes one of the guns, a Webley-Fosbery semi-automatic revolver, and fires it toward the camera. Beethoven's Seventh Symphony plays as the head floats through the air over opening credits.Inside the stone head, there are piles of grain and potatoes, as well as several Eternals, naked, sealed in plastic, and apparently in a state of suspended animation. Zed has managed to stow away aboard the head, hiding beneath one of the piles of grain. Suddenly he notices Arthur Frayn, whom he instinctively shoots. Arthur, wounded perhaps fatally, floats out of the head yelling ""without me you are nothing... how pointless!""The head lands ""over the rainbow,"" so to speak, in the land of the Eternals-- Vortex Four, to be precise. Exploring the surroundings, Zed finds what looks like a farming community with hydroponically grown vegetables, a mill and bakery as well as stables. Entering the second floor of the greenhouse, he finds a room decorated with diagrams of evolution, signs of the zodiac, a shrine to Zardoz and a jack-in-the-box. Zed hears a disembodied male voice, the source of which is shown to be a crystal ring. When Zed shakes the ring, a hologram appears that depicts the agricultural needs of the various areas in the Vortex; what they require and what they have produced in surplus. The ring responds to Zed's verbal commands by showing him images. When he asks ""Who lives here,"" he is startled to see Arthur Frayn's face appear in the room, announcing his name and vortex number. Zed can hear people talking outside and slips out of the house. He sneaks around outside and watches as a group of Eternals carry the plastic-wrapped bodies on stretchers, disappearing into a pyramid that looks too small to contain them. He sees his first flower and asks the crystal ring what it is. The voice explains that it is a flower whose purpose is ""decorative."" Zed finds a river and washes his face as a female Eternal approaches. He tries to shoot her but the woman uses telepathy to blind Zed momentarily. She's obviously intrigued to see a Brutal in the Vortex and asks him how he arrived there and where he thinks he is. He replies that he thinks he is in the Vortex where, according to Zardoz, you go when you die. She explains the only way he could have gotten here is through the stone head but Zed will not divulge any further details, nor is the woman able to extract this information by reading his mind, which she attributes to possible shock he may have sustained.The woman, a scientist named May (Sara Kestelman) consults the Tabernacle, a type of artificial intelligence that oversees all activity within the Vortex, to learn the whereabouts of Arthur Frayn, who was delegated to manage the Outlands, which he did by pretending to be the god Zardoz. The Tabernacle shows Arthur Frayn's accident falling from the stone head and indicates that Frayn died and is in the process of being reincarnated, but it won't show May the final moments before Arthur's death. May argues with another community leader named Consuella (Charlotte Rampling) about what should be done with Zed. May wants to keep Zed alive so that they can study him-- he is the first Brutal who has ever infiltrated the Vortex. However Consuella views Zed as little more than a dangerous animal-- a threat to the stability of their society who should be put down as soon as possible.The women decide to put the matter to a vote. They call a meeting and connect Zed to an apparatus that displays his thoughts on a screen. The other Eternals want to see his memories. Their society has gradually evolved to become asexual and anhedonic, and they find the images of Zed and the other Exterminators raping and killing Brutals in the Outlands both repulsive and arousing. After debating the pro's and cons of performing research on ""the monster,"" the majority of Eternals, bored and curious, vote telepathically to spare Zed's life, at least for three weeks.A cynical Eternal named Friend (John Alderton) takes on the task of babysitting Zed. Once they're alone, he attempts to use telepathy to force Zed to reveal where Arthur Frayn is. When Zed thwarts this attempt, Friend assures Zed that he and Arthur were close confidants and he knows more about whatever Arthur was planning than Zed thinks.Zed continues to play dumb as Friend employs his services to stack and organize priceless works of art in the Vortex's cultural archive and to cart Friend around on a wagon while he delivers bread to the needy. First they stop by a colony of outcasts called Renegades. These are Eternals who, through boredom, malice or discontent, repeatedly violated the rule of law and as a result were punished by being aged, gradually, into senility. They will spend eternity in feeble-minded old age. The next group they visit are the Apathetics. These Eternals stand around staring blankly in a catatonic, vegetative state, having lost the will to live but, like the Renegades and all other Eternals, unable to die. Friend tells Zed that this is the main reason Brutals are now forced to farm crops for Zardoz-- someone needs to feed these unproductive members of Eternal society. Death is an impossibility in the Vortex because anyone who kills himself is simply reincarnated by the Tabernacle.Zed witnesses the final statements in the trial of an Eternal named George Saden (Bosco Hogan), who pleads innocence at first but eventually reveals his bitter contempt for the law and his fellow Eternals. Friend votes to have George acquitted but he is outvoted by the rest of the Eternals, who sentence George to be aged five years. ""Welcome to paradise,"" quips Friend.Zed is put on display again while Consuella gives a lecture on Brutals' sexual response. She shows Zed a series of pornographic images to see if he will get an erection. The movies do not stimulate him but just looking at Consuella does. This seems to embarrass her as well as arouse her slightly. Zed is placed in a cage among the rest of the animals in the Vortex. Consuella tests his reflexes and asks him why he likes to sleep. He says he likes it because he has dreams. The Eternals do not dream, having achieved ""total consciousness."" Now ""second level meditation"" takes the place of sleep.May then begins to analyze Zed, explaining that he is a second or third generation mutant, and therefore genetically stable. She is shocked to discover that from an evolutionary standpoint, Zed is actually superior to the Eternals in most ways. This confirms her suspicions that Arthur has been amusing himself in the Outlands by selectively breeding certain Brutals over the course of generations to create genetically advanced humans such as Zed. While this indicates that Zed is indeed more of a threat than even Consuella suspected, May hesitates to kill him. ""For the sake of science,"" she will keep his secret as long as he follows her orders and doesn't draw attention to himself.At lunch, Zed's presence continues to disrupt the community. Another psychic vote is taken as to his fate and it is decided that May has a week to complete her scientific study of Zed. The Eternals propose to meditate upon the idea that ""the monster is a mirror, and when we look at him, we look at our own hidden faces."" Friend refuses to go to second level with the group, thus disrupting their tranquility. Resisting the group's mind control, he states that the Vortex is an obscenity and that he hates all women, birth and fertility. Friend is considered to be beyond redemption and sentenced to be exiled among the Renegades.While the Eternals are meditating, Zed runs out to the periphery shield of Vortex Four. He can see some Exterminators over the mountain and gets their attention. Zed then goes to the Renegade colony to find Friend. Friend, who has been artificially aged, tells the other Renegades that this creature from the outside world has the gift of death, and that they should kill Zed before May can use him to propagate another doomed generation of Eternals. The elders start to attack Zed, but he easily fends them off. Friend tells Zed that he craves death not just for himself and the Vortex but all human life on Earth. Zed scoffs at Friend's nihilistic attitude, concluding: ""You stink of despair.""Zed asks Friend where he can find the Tabernacle and how he can destroy it. Friend can't remember, having become senile. One of the Renegades advises Zed to seek May, whom he finds in a state of second level meditation, already knowing his intent. Zed says that he wants the truth and when May insists that he must give truth to get it, he allows May to read his mind. We see flashbacks of Zed hunting and killing Brutals, until one day he ""loses his innocence."" He follows a figure in a mask who leads him into a library and begins to teach Zed to read. Zed, whose intellect is more advanced than the Eternals, rapidly learns about the history of the world before its destruction. Eventually Zed reads a book called The Wonderful Wizard of Oz which reveals to him the fictitious basis of Zardoz, a deity invented by Frayn purely to control the Brutals.After learning that Zardoz did not exist, Zed resolved to hide aboard the stone head and make his way into the Vortex to find the truth. As Zed's memories conclude, May feels sexuality stirring within her, a result of her prolonged physical contact with Zed. They embrace, only to be interrupted by Consuella who accuses May of bestiality and suggests that May be aged fifty years. Consuella uses telepathy on Zed, blinding him, but he still manages to overpower her physically. Consuella declares that the entire community will now be contaminated with his animal instincts to hunt and kill. An Eternal named Avalow (Sally Anne Newton) restores his sight with her powers. She indicates that Zed is ""the one.. the liberator."" Avalow explains that as the world fell to ruin, the rich and powerful classes salvaged what art, culture and technology they could and erected an impenetrable shield around their oasis of civilization to protect it from the encroaching Dark Age. Unfortunately, they had to turn their backs callously on the rest of humanity, eventually coming to regard the people on the other side of the shield as a separate and inferior race of Brutals.Zed, she says, is the price they are paying, having brought hate and anger into the Vortex to infect them all. Suddenly, Zed is attacked by other Eternals. He escapes, runs out to the periphery shield of Vortex Four and starts signaling instructions to the band of Exterminators posted on the other side. While hiding from Consuella and her followers in the area where the Apathetics are consigned, Zed's life-force awakens them.The Exterminators storm the Vortex and all hell breaks loose. The Apathetics regain their emotions and libido and engage in sex and murder. The Renegades leave their colony and run amok, while the ordinarily law-abiding Eternals, led by Consuella, continue to hunt for Zed. Friend finds Zed and takes him to May.May asks Zed to inseminate them all (the only Eternals interested in surviving coincidentally all seem to be female) and they will teach him all they know, in the hope that he can use this knowledge to destroy the Tabernacle. They ""touch teach"" him through osmosis and he gifts them with his super-sperm. The phrase ""The Law of the Unity of Opposites"" is repeated several times. Different languages and music are transmitted. Finally he knows everything they know. Zed asks how the Vortex came about. Friend responds that it was designed by scientists, most of whom were middle-aged at the time of its creation and are now Renegades due to their inability to tolerate immortality. They used their power to erase any memory of the Tabernacle or how to destroy it so that the human race would evolve to perfection. They intended for their children to inherit this legacy. But by eliminating death, they arrested the natural cycles of change and renewal that allow progress, leading to their current stagnant and hopeless predicament.A voice calls Zed and he is beckoned through a series of mannequin figures to find the rebuilt Arthur Frayn dressed in a top hat. Frayn quotes T.S. Eliot and prompts Zed to fill in the poem-- it is ""I am Lazarus, come from the dead. Come back to tell you all. I shall tell you all."" He holds a mysterious clear glass ball that he tells Zed to examine. It becomes a faceted crystal. Consuella finds Zed, but when she tries to kill him, she realises that she's lost the urge. She says ""In hunting you, I have become you."" Zed quotes Nietzsche, ""He who fights too long against dragons, becomes a dragon himself.""Zed asks the Tabernacle where it is but it won't provide any answers, having been programmed to protect itself. Finally Zed realizes that it must be housed in the crystal he holds in his hand. The Tabernacle admits that Zed's solved the puzzle and allows him access to its inner dimensions, which look like a hall of mirrors. Zed sees holographic images of the Eternals whose minds all connect with the Tabernacle. Zed fires his gun at one of the reflections. The crystal bleeds and tells him that he has destroyed it / them, ""we are gone."" The Eternals begin to rampage through their cultural archive, destroying pieces of art in their frenzied pursuit of Zed. Zed now has a powerful aura which he uses to move some Eternals back through time to preserve the art they smashed. Friend asks Zed what is next. Zed says the oldest Renegade will know.The old man remembers the way it was. The Vortex is an offense against nature -- which is why nature made Zed. The old man dies. The stone head crashes to the ground. Death has returned to the Vortex. May and the rest of Zed's baby-mamas form a caravan and leave the Vortex to start over somewhere else. The Renegades die of old age. Arthur brags that he was the one who came up with the idea of breeding Zed, but Zed says he has looked into the force that put the idea in Arthur's mind: ""We've all been used."" The Exterminators roam the Vortex killing Eternals who beg to die. Zed runs away with Consuella to take shelter in the remains of the stone head.Beethoven's 7th symphony plays again as the Vortex falls. Consuella is pregant and gives birth. The child grows into a man and leaves his parents. Zed and Consuella grow old together and die."

A young soldier is killed in the line of duty in the Vietnam War. That same night, he returns home, brought back by his mother's wish that he not die. Upon his return, he sits in his room, refusing to see his friends or family, coming out only at night.

At night, Andy becomes inexplicably lively and animated, wandering the town and spending time in the local cemetery.

They are both killed during the attack. The other drive-in patrons witness the last attack and panic. This causes Andy to flee before he can infuse himself with his friend's blood.

The Phantom of Liberty,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071487/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A series of surreal sequences that critique morality and society in a stream of consciousness style. As unusual, eccentric, and bizarre vignettes of mundane and seemingly innocuous conventions of our social and private lives success one another, somehow,Napoléon Bonaparte's troops, earthly monks, dangerous snipers, and the peculiar disappearance of a beloved one metamorphose into banal instances of our daily existence. With this in mind, under those surreal circumstances, the abnormal becomes normal, the obvious transforms into something unclear or even invisible, and the extraordinary transfigures into ordinary. But, are things always black and white? How real is the haunting spectre of liberty?—Nick Riganas Toledo, 1808, a Spanish city occupied by French Napoleonic troops. A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out Down with liberty! or Long live chains! The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers. The captain caresses a statue of a medieval woman and is knocked unconscious by her husband (a knights funerary statue). In revenge, the captain exhumes the body of the wife to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.Cut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park; there are implications of child abduction or pedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is fed up with symmetry as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images which we assume to be pornographic when we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of architecture (there is a satirical nod towards Freudian symbolism in the images of tunnels and columns). The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny. At bedtime, the husband cant sleep as he is woken in the night by a cockerel, a postman and an emu wandering through his bedroom.In the next scene, the husband visits his doctor, who dismisses these nighttime experiences as apparitions despite the fact that the husband has physical evidence in the form of a letter from the nocturnal postman. The evidence is never considered as the doctors nurse interrupts the conversation to tell her employer that she must visit her sick father. The nurse drives through a rainy night, meeting a military tank on the road that is apparently hunting foxes. The soldiers tell her that the road ahead is blocked; the nurse drives to an isolated hotel.A storm breaks as the nurse checks in at the small rural hotel. Some Carmelite monks are also staying at the hotel. She takes supper in her room while a flamenco dancer and guitarist perform in an adjacent room. The monks interrupt her as she is dressing for bed. They offer to use a holy effigy and prayer to assist her sick father, they begin to pray. Time has passed and the monks are playing a game of poker with the nurse and the hotel manager, gambling with holy relics, smoking and drinking alcohol.That same night, some new guests arrive at the hotel; a young man and his aunt. The young nephew has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair yet another sexual taboo is addressed. They retire to their room, the elderly aunt confesses that she is a virgin, when the nephew pulls back the sheets to look at her naked body; she has the body of a young woman. The nephew is refused by his aunt and leaves his room to join another couple (a hatter and his female assistant) for a drink. The nurse and the four monks are also invited into the hatters room. While the guests are socialising, the hatters assistant dons a dominatrix outfit with a whip. The hatter, who is wearing bottomless trousers, proceeds to be masochistically flagellated by his assistant in front of the other guests who are shocked and leave. The nephew returns to his aunt, who is now willing to make love with him.The next morning, the nurse leaves for the town of Argenton, giving a lift to another resident who is breakfasting in the bar. This resident is a professor at the police academy. He is dropped off at work where he gives a lecture to a class of delinquent policemen on the subject of the relativism of laws, customs and taboos. The lecture is constantly interrupted until only two officers are left in the class. The professor continues, using a dinner party at his friends house to illustrate a point he is making. We then cut to the dinner party which is being held in a modern bourgeois apartment.The guests are seated around the table on flushing toilets. They politely discuss various issues around the topic of defecation whilst publicly using the toilets that they are sitting on. When a guest is hungry, he excuses himself and retires to a private cubicle to eat food.We cut back to the police lecture. The two policeman go on duty where they stop a speeding motorist (Mr. Legendre) who is rushing to see his doctor. Mr. Legendre is eventually told by his doctor that he has cancer and offered a cigarette, he slaps his doctor and returns home. Once home, he tells his wife that nothing is wrong with him. They receive a phone call informing them that their daughter has disappeared from school.We now cut to the school where the teachers insist that the little girl has vanished despite the fact that she is physically present. Her disappearance is reported to the police, the girl is present but none of the adults admit to her presence. In this absurdist scene, she is there the adults are able to see and speak to her, yet they act as if she is missing.We follow one of the policemen, who is having his shoes shined. We then follow the man who is sitting next to him to the top of a tower block. This man is a sniper who randomly kills people in the streets below. He is arrested, found guilty and sentenced to death but leaves the courtroom to be treated as a celebrity.Mr. Legendre is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter. The prefect is about to read a letter explaining how the girl was found but is interrupted and leaves to visit a bar. In the bar he meets a woman who looks like his dead sister (we see a flashback in which he remembers his sister playing the piano, naked). He then receives a phone call from his dead sister, asking him to meet her at the mausoleum. When he visits the cemetery at night, he finds a telephone in the crypt by his sisters coffin; her hair is hanging out of the coffin. He is suddenly arrested for desecration by officers who refuse to believe that he is the Prefect of Police.The prefect is taken to his office, where a different man takes his place. The two men treat each other cordially and discuss crowd control as if they are acquainted. We see the animals in the zoo, the two police chiefs arrive and direct police control of an unseen riot.

Chinatown,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A private detective hired to expose an adulterer in 1930s Los Angeles finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, corruption, and murder. In 1937 Los Angeles, private investigator Jake 'J.J.' Gittes specializes in cheating-spouse cases. His current target is Hollis Mulwray, high-profile chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, whose wife suspects him of infidelity. In following Mulwray, Gittes witnesses some usual business dealings, such as a public meeting for construction of a new dam to create additional water supply for Los Angeles, as fresh water is vital to the growing community during the chronic drought; Mulwray opposes the dam. Eventually Gittes sees Mulwray meeting with an unknown young woman who isn't his wife. Once news of the supposed tryst between Mulwray and this woman hits the media, additional information comes to light that makes Gittes believe that Mulwray is being framed for something and that he himself is being set up. In his investigation of the issue behind Mulwray's framing and his own setup, Gittes is assisted by Mulwray's wife Evelyn, but he thinks she isn't being forthright with him. The further he gets into the investigation, the more secrets he uncovers about the Mulwrays' professional and personal dealings, including Mulwray's former business-partnership with Evelyn's father, Noah Cross. The identity of the unknown woman may be the key to uncovering the whole story.—Huggo In 1937 Los Angeles, private detective J.J. Gittes is hired by a woman to investigate whether her husband is having an affair. The husband, Hollis Mulwray, is the chief water engineer for the city of Los Angeles.

Then Hollis Mulwray turns up dead.—grantss Profoundly cynical but also empathetic, 1937 Los Angeles' well-dressed private investigator and expert in adultery cases, Jake Gittes, runs a successful business. Then, all of a sudden, a cryptic blonde walks into his office, convinced that her husband, Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, is having an affair. And, just like that, Gittes finds himself entangled in a murky case of deceit and murder. As a result, corrupt government officials and murderous henchmen are after Gittes for sticking his nose into an elaborate and dangerous conspiracy, and as if that weren't enough, Jake is now starting to believe that he's been had. However, in this thorny case, almost everybody has a skeleton in the closet. Can Gittes get to the bottom of it before it is too late?—Nick Riganas In 1937, in Los Angeles, the private investigator J.J. Gittes is hired by a woman called Evelyn Mulwray to follow her husband Hollis Mulwray to know if he is having an affair. Hollis is the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Chief Engineer, who is refusing to create a new water reservoir that he considers unsafe. Soon Gittes sees Hollis with a girl and photographs them. Then he follows Hollis, and he sees water being released from the reservoir during the night. On the next morning, his photos of Hollis are published on a newspaper but when he returns to his office, he meets the real Evelyn Mulwray with her lawyer to sue him. Gittes realizes that he was deceived by someone that wanted to harm Hollis Mulwray, but soon he finds that the chief engineer was drowned in the reservoir. His further investigation shows that the water supply is disrupted to the local farmers and someone is buying the cheap lands to profit in the near future.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) to spy on her husband, Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly oppose the creation of a new reservoir, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), and that he can expect a lawsuit.Realizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Mulwray's husband is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez) fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a freshwater reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that, although huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night, the farming land is almost dry. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill (Roy Jenson) and a henchman, who slashes Gittes's nose. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions (Diane Ladd), who identifies herself as the Imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer, but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries.Gittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of his wife's wealthy father, Noah Cross (John Huston). Noah and Mulray together owned the entire city's water supply back in 1925, but Mulray felt that the public should own the water and hence the company was nationalized. Gittes meets the new chief of the Water department and accuses him of wasting the city's water supply in the middle of a drought and murdering Mulray, so that he himself could become chief. Gittes threatens to go to the press with the story. The new chief admits that water is being released daily for the orange farmers of the Northwest Valley, but wont tell Gittes exactly which part of the valley is profiting from the largess as the valley as no legal right over LA's water supply.Evelyn is shaken when Gittes tells her that he knows Mulray was in business with Noah. She tells Gittes that she married Mulray after they ended their partnership (which intrigues Gittes that Evelyn would marry Noah's ex-partner after they had a falling out over business)
Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes's fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners, who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply. Gittes deduces that the new proposed dam that Mulray opposed was not for LA, but for irrigating Nortwest Valley and that most the valley has recently changed hands.Gittes deduces that the water department is drying up select areas of the Northwest Valley land so it can be bought at a reduced price, and that Mulwray was murdered when he discovered the plan. He discovers that a former retirement home resident is one of the valley's new landowners, and seemingly purchased the property a week after his death. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the home and confirm that the real estate deals were surreptitiously completed in the names of several of the home's residents. Their visit is interrupted by the suspicious retirement home director, who has called Mulvihill.After fleeing Mulvihill and his thugs, Gittes and Evelyn hide at Evelyn's house and sleep together. Early in the morning, Evelyn gets a phone call and has to leave suddenly; she warns Gittes that her father is dangerous. Gittes follows her car to a house, where he spies her through the windows comforting Mulwray's mistress. He accuses Evelyn of holding the woman against her will, but she confesses that the woman is her sister.
The next day, an anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions's apartment; he finds her murdered and Escobar waiting for his arrival. Escobar tells him the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir where his body was found. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At Evelyn's mansion, Gittes finds her servants packing her things. He realizes her garden pond is salt water and discovers a pair of bifocals in it. He confronts Evelyn about her ""sister"", whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. After Gittes slaps her, she admits that the woman, Katherine (Belinda Palmer), is her sister and her daughter: her father raped her when she was fifteen. She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to settle their deal. Cross admits his intention to annex the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes accuses Cross of murdering Mulwray in Evelyn's salt water pond and then dropping his bifocals there in the scuffle. Cross takes the bifocals at gunpoint, and he and Mulvihill force Gittes to drive them to the women. When they reach the Chinatown address, the police are already there and detain Gittes. When Cross approaches Katherine, Evelyn shoots him in the arm and drives away with Katherine. The police open fire, killing Evelyn.
Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released. Lawrence Walsh, one of Gittes's associates, tells him: ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."""

Her journey takes her to a strange Californian seaside town governed by a mysterious undead cult. After losing contact with her artist father, Arletty travels to the west coast. Though she doesn't find him, she meets Thom, an odd wealthy man who's travelling with 2 lovers, Toni and Laura, to meet her father. She reads his diary and realises there's something strange with the residents of this California town.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Worried about her estranged artist dad, Arletty drives to the seaside town of Point Dume, California, to check in on him. As she asks around to find out if anyone has seen her father, a chance encounter with the town's eccentrics and well-off visiting stranger Thom will lead to hair-raising revelations about the regional folklore and a cursed anniversary. But first things first. Why do people go to the beach every night? Who is behind the local religious movement? Who or, better yet, what is killing the townspeople?—Nick Riganas A man (Walter Hill) runs frantically down a deserted residential street at night, from some unseen threat. A doorway in a walled-in yard opens, and a girl wordlessly allows the man to come in. He collapses next a swimming pool, exhausted, and the girl comes to his side, seemingly to help him. Instead, she suddenly produces a strait razor and slashes his throat.A vague female figure walks down a long hallway, while we hear her voice narrating. She is Arletty (Marianna Hill), confined to a mental institution. She warns of a town called Point Dume, where the moon turned blood red and caused some kind of change to come upon the residents. ""They'll take you one by one and no one will hear your scream!"" she says. The movie proceeds in flashback, with Arletty narrating occasionally in voice-over.Arletty explains that she was originally traveling to Point Dume to make contact with her father, a painter who lived and worked there in a beach house. He had stopped communicating with Arletty after a series of letters that became more and more bizarre, as he seemed threatened by some unexplained illness or madness. On her way to Point Dume, she stops for gas at an isolated Mobil station, where she finds the lone attendant (Charles Dierkop) firing a gun into the darkness at some unseen target. He holsters the gun and comes to pump Arletty's gas, when a pickup truck driven by an odd looking albino man (Bennie Robinson) also pulls up. While refueling the truck, the attendant surreptitiously looks under a tarp in the back and discovers two dead bodies, one with the eyes ripped out and the other being the man from the beginning of the film with the slashed throat. He says nothing, but tries to get rid of Arletty quickly, sending her away without even paying for her gas. Some time after she leaves, the attendant is murdered inside the service station, which has its lights turned off at the same time, when a strange figure (Willard Huyck, the director) suddenly leaps out of the car he's working on.Arletty goes to her father's house and finds it abandoned. The walls are elaborately decorated with eerie murals depicting life-size human figures, and Arletty finds a journal her father kept where he discusses a sickness he seems to be enduring that borders on madness. Desperate to make contact with someone who may know his whereabouts, she goes into town the next day to an art gallery that used to sell his work, only to find that they now claim they never sold his art. The gallery curator refers her to three people who he says were just in the gallery earlier that day also looking for her father, and Arletty locates them at a local motel. They are Thom (Michael Greer), Toni (Joy Bang), and Laura (Anitra Ford), and when Arletty enters their room, they are interviewing a local vagrant (Elisha Cook, Jr.), who relates a story passed on to him by his father about a time when the moon turned blood red and caused the locals to revert to savage acts of violence. Thom presses him to elaborate, but he becomes afraid and leaves hurriedly.Thom explains to Arletty that he is a foreign aristocrat, a collector of regional legends, and a fan of her father's work. He says he stopped by the gallery and they had his work displayed in the window, but refused to sell it to him, which contradicts the gallery attendant's statement that they never carried her father's work. After Arletty leaves, she's stopped by the vagrant, who warns her that if she encounters her father, she must burn him in order to avoid becoming his victim. The next day, Arletty awakens to find Thom and the two women are in her father's house with her. Thom explains that the old man was found dead later that day, seemingly eaten by animals, and all the local motels suddenly refused to rent them a room, so they had nowhere to go.Arletty allows them to stay, and Thom seems to take an interest in her, which causes Laura to become annoyed and jealous. She tells Toni that she's leaving, and after setting out on foot, a vehicle stops to offer her a ride. It's the same pickup truck driven by the albino, with a small group of men sitting in the back who are staring emotionless up at the sky. Laura decides to accept the ride, but changes her mind once the albino pulls a mouse out of his pocket and eats it alive. She asks to be let out, and she walks the rest of the way to town on foot. She finds the town deserted, and she follows a lone figure into a Ralphs supermarket. Unable to attract the man's attention, she follows him through the market until she discovers a group of townsfolk gathered around a meat cooler, ravenously devouring the raw meat like animals. They suddenly notice her and chase her until they have her cornered, dragging her to the floor and eating her alive.The next day, Arletty is summoned by the police to identify her father's body, which has been discovered on the beach. Arletty is distraught, but behaving strangely. Toni becomes bored, and Thom sends her into town with the car so she can go to the movies. Back at the house, Arletty discovers that she is bleeding from her ear, and she has a strange experience where she burns her hand on the hot stove but doesn't feel any pain. She confides in Thom that the body on the beach was not her father, something she knows because she didn't recognize his hands. Thom suddenly becomes concerned about Toni.In town, Toni attends a screening of a movie called ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"". She buys a ticket from a ticket booth holder (Gloria Katz) who barely acknowledges her, and finds the rest of the lobby deserted. The minute she walks in, the attendant puts up a ""closed"" sign, and the lights on the marquee are turned out. Toni finds the large theater empty except for one or two other patrons. Having a seat in the center near the front, she watches a movie, a trailer for ""Gone With the West"", while the camera reveals more and more of the ghoulish townsfolk, including the albino and the ticket holder, gathering in the seats behind her, until the theater is nearly full. Finally two of the ghouls take a seat on either side of Toni, and she notices they are bleeding from the eyes. Suddenly she turns around and realizes just how many of the strange people are in there with her and starts to panic, rushing for the exits, which are now blocked from the other side. Trapped inside with the ghouls, the movie ends, the lights turn on, and the screen goes white, and suddenly they rush at her and eat her while she screams.Thom, who has arrived in town too late to help Toni, sees some of the strange townspeople. Two police officers in riot gear arrive and order a small crowd of them to disperse, after which the crowd advances on them. They start firing into them, but the ghouls are unaffected by the bullets. Suddenly, one of the officers starts bleeding from the eyes, somehow infected by the same thing the townsfolk have. The normal officer fires on him and runs off scared, but the other shoots him in the back. The mob, including the officer's former partner, descends on him and they eat his corpse. Thom runs off and is chased by a few of the mob. One of them attacks him and claws at his neck, but he is able to break away. He encounters a scared but normal woman who tells Thom her family and friends fell prey to the ghouls, but she instantly transforms as they speak, bleeding from her eyes.Meanwhile, Arletty discovers that the signs of her infection have worsened. She pokes a pin into her leg and cannot feel it, and she vomits a horde of insects and lizards into the sink. Finding someone else in the house with her, she realizes it is her father (Royal Dano), who tells her that the townspeople have been infected by a century-old curse brought on by a ""dark stranger"" who rode into town on a horse 100 years ago. A survivor of the Donner Party, this stranger brought with him a strange curse of cannibalism, after which he killed a hunter to make his point, and walked into the sea, promising to return in 100 years when the moon turned blood red. He warns Arletty to leave, but she refuses to go without him, at which point he becomes violent and tries to attack her. Remembering the words of the vagrant, Arletty sets him on fire and frees him from the undead curse.Thom returns to the house and discovers the charred body, at which point a terrified Arletty attacks him and stabs his arm with scissors. Thom manages to calm her and they bandage his wound, but ghouls start breaking into the house and trying to surround them. They escape to the beach, where they find others waiting for the arrival of the ""dark stranger"". Trapped by the mass of ghouls, who appear unaffected by the sunlight, they swim out into the water, where Thom drowns due to his wounded arm.The film ends with Arletty back in the institution, where her voice-over narration informs us the ghouls pulled her from the water and dressed her in a gown as an offering to the dark stranger, who returned as predicted. She says he let her go in order to carry his story to others, which is why she was institutionalized.

A low budget, sci-fi satire that focuses on a group of scientists whose mission is to destroy unstable planets. 20 years into their mission, they have battle their alien mascot, that resembles a beach ball, as well as a ""sensitive"" and intelligent bombing device that starts to question the meaning of its existence.—yusufpiskin The misadventures of a deep space wrecking crew. Charged with an endless mission to destroy unstable planets and long since worn down by routine, isolation, faulty equipment, and each other they're slowly pushed to the edge in this offbeat, low-budget response to 2001.—yusufpiskin The crew of the Dark Star are on a 20 year mission to clear a path in space by destroying planets that are in the way of navigation routes. After a series of mishaps Mother, the ship's computer, can no longer persuade Bomb not to detonate. Even the dead captain is of little help in arguing with Bomb who is bound to do his duty.—Stephen Hendricks <shendric@fortmyers.com> In the late 22st Century, an incoming message from Earth arrives to a spaceship. Colonel Watkins (Miles Watkins) says that the trip is being broadcast live which has been nearly 20 years since it was launched from planet Earth. The messages take around ten years to arrive. There was a radioactive leak, and Commander Powell (Joe Saunders) died. In consequence, there is a week of mourning on Earth, all flags are half-mast, but Congress won't pay for a radiation shield. ""Dark Star"" is the spaceship.There are four crewmen on board the spaceship. The new commander, Talby (Dre Pahich; voiced by John Carpenter), sits in a bubble on top of the ship, falls asleep... dreaming about the Phoenix asteroid which circles the universe every 1.23 trillion years. The other crewmen, Sgt. Francis Boiler (Cal Kuniholm), Lt. Doolittle (Brian Narelle) and Sgt. Pinback (Dan O'Bannon) spend most of their days in the cramped control room. Doolittle has become a bit ""spicy"" from the years in isolation.The crew can speak to Bomb 19 (voice of Alan Sheretz), which destroys a planet. Dark Star goes to hyperspace and leaves the hell out of there, watching the explosion from far away. The computer (voice of Cookie Knapp) says that they've destroyed the last unstable planet on that solar system. However, the computer finds another unstable red-dwarf planet, so they have to go and check it out.Boiler puts on some country music on the radio. On the ship's log, we can hear that a part of the ship self-destructed. They are dancing to the sound of funky music. The computer tells about something on collision course, and the defense system was destroyed some time ago, so they try to do something manually. A thunder activates a bomb. Bomb 20 (voice of Adam Beckenbaugh) is deployed, but luckily, the computer overrides the orders and Bomb 20 finally goes back to its place. Images of a hole around the destroyed laser machine.Doolittle, Pinback and Talby go to their room. They sleep in the same place, and it looks like an apartment from the projects in the 1960's. One of them makes music with empty bottles of liquor.Talby should be watching the ship, but he's always sleeping. He is advised to see the rest of the ship. He says that space can be wonderful and full of color, and Doolittle says that he misses Earth and Mars as well. Boiler starts shooting a square of metal just to distract himself, although Pinback tells him not to do it. The computer tells Pinback about the alien going awry, telling him that it was his original idea to bring him into the ship.The alien (Nick Castle) literally looks like a beach ball with legs. It doesn't want to eat. Pinback brought it in because he thought it was fine. Pinback is cleaning up the alien's mess when it attacks him. The alien leaves the room. Pinback gives it a plastic toy, and it eats it, but when Pinback goes to pick the broom, the alien is not there. It holds the broom and hits Pinback with it. Pinback looks for the alien in the bowels of the ship. Pinback uses a plank to go to the alien. A sign says ""Emergency air lock interior room"". The alien goes around Pinback and takes the plank away. He tries to cross the shaft, although the corridor is very narrow. It is the lift shaft, and the computer says that it's been activated. Pinback tries to move on towards the alien, but it attacks him. He falls down, but can hold onto the thin layer of pass-way. The alien jump and tickles Pinback. The lift seems to stop when Pinback interrupts it. The lift goes up again, with Pinback holding onto an outer metallic handle. The alien turns on the laser, which makes all the systems go crazy.Meanwhile, Doolittle and Talby have kept on talking. Bomb 20 has received a signal to ignite itself again. The computer tries to reason with it, saying that it was an error again. Bomb 20 finally agrees, but it says that that was going to be the last time.The lift stops at the third floor, and Pinback thinks of jumping out. He unscrews a floor trap and gets onto the elevator. He gets stuck. He tries to use the phone for help, but it's out of order. He presses another button, and opera music resounds. The elevator keeps going up and down for no apparent reason. He presses another button to clean the lift, and presses 1, which will make the elevator clean itself.Finally Pinback leaves the elevator amid a mist of smoke and with a metallic lid around his waist. Now, at this moment, he's really pissed off, so he goes to pick and anesthetic gun. Soon enough, he finds the alien, cornered somewhere. He shoots the alien, who flies all over the place, and ends up deflated.Pinback talks about his ordeal to the rest of the crew. They have lunch together talking about Talby being mentally unstable. Talby goes to the computer room, and says to Doolittle that the computer has found the malfunction in the ship.Powell left a message, saying that he doesn't intend to come back to Earth. Pinback checks his past diary logs, stating that nobody recognizes his good qualities, and that nobody said ""happy birthday"" to him. The computer has finally found the malfunction: it's the laser. However, everybody is sound sleeping but for Pinback.Eventually, they find the unstable planet. Bomb 20 is deployed. Pinback is in the emergency air lock, where there is a door which can be opened without depressurization. There, there is the laser who works badly. Nobody wants to hear Pinback, because they are busy with the deployment of Bomb 20. The laser is turned on, and it shoots inside the ship. The laser makes Pinback blind, and he crosses the path of the laser beams. This creates further malfunctions, so they can't drop the bomb. Everybody panics on the bridge because the explosion sequence goes on, and Bomb 20 refuses to turn itself off.The computer will only contain the damage done to the ship by Bomb 20 up to a certain degree. They have to ask Powell, in the cryogenic deep-freeze compartment, what could be done. Powell asks about the Dodgers, and complains that he's lonely. When he is about to give a suggestion, the mike has a malfunction, and then Powell forgets about it. Pinback tries to reason with Bomb 20 while Doolittle questions Powell. Doolittle goes out to space and talks to Bomb 20.DOOLITTLE: How do you know that you exist?BOMB 20: Intuition.DOOLITTLE: You can't base everything on intuition.BOMB 20: I think, therefore I am.The dialogue goes on and on like that. Bomb 20 agrees that its experience of the outer world depends on possibly wrong information. It says that it'd be nice to keep on discussing the matter with Doolittle, but that it has no time, because it will go off in 49 seconds. Meanwhile, Boiler tries to shoot the bomb. In the fight with Pinback, he almost shoots him.Doolittle tells Bomb 20 to consider what his purpose in life is. ""To explode, of course"", says Bomb 20. As it can only explode once, it wouldn't like to explode at the wrong time, would it? ""Of course not"", says Bomb 20, but as it had admitted before that it had no proof that the outer world does exist. ""Nine seconds"", says Bomb 20, and ""my memory is very good"". It has no proof that the orders are either wrong or correct. Bomb 20 goes back inside Dark Space to think further about the matter.Doolittle tries to rescue Talby, who was shot out of Dark Space. Now, Bomb 20 thinks that no order coming from the outer world can be reliable, so it explodes itself happily although Pinback tries to reason with it. Both Pinback and Boiler are killed by the explosion, while Talby and Doolittle are left stranded floating in space. Powell goes flying away wrapped in a bath of ice.Talby gets trapped in a traveling concussion of lights, so that he'll be traveling through the universe forever as part of the Phoenix asteroid. Doolittle uses a piece of debris to surf down to the red planet as a shooting star where he presumably burns up to his death.---written by KrystelClaire"

A multi-layered satire of race relations in America.

Meanwhile, Randy and another cellmate an older man named Pappy (Scatman Crothers) manage to escape from inside the prison and wait for Sampson and the Preacherman to help them get out. While waiting for them, Randy unwillingly listens to Pappy tell a story about three guys that resemble and Randy and his friends. Pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox are forced to pack up and leave their Southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. The trio moves to Harlem, New York City ""home to every black man"". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the ""cousin"" of ""Black Jesus"", and that he gives his followers ""the strength to kill whites"". In a flashy stage performance in his ""church"", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for ""donations"". When Rabbit attempts to turn the crowd, Savior tries to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrase of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit that if he can't kill his opponents, then they'll kill him instead.Rabbit first goes up against Madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and bagman for the Mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they're not worth it).

In the peaceful, lush, green countryside gruesome murders are committed by the dead who have been brought to life by ultra-sonic radiation. Two travelers from the city who meet accidentally are harassed and implicated by the cops for the murders.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com A cop chases two young people visiting the English countryside, suspecting them of a local murder. Unbeknownst to him, the real culprits are the living dead, brought to life with a thirst for human flesh by radiation being used by area farmers as a pesticide alternative.—Jojo Mac Brought about by the use of a new, radiation emitting device intended to destroy insect's nervous systems, the dead are brought back to life due to the jump start the radiation provides to their nervous systems. After the murder of a woman's estranged husband, police suspect the woman, her sister and a relative stranger (who was only along because the sister had run into his motorcycle only hours prior) of involvement in the murder, and as the bodies begin to accumulate the police chief becomes more and more convinced of their involvement.—Patrick George (Ray Lovelock) leaves his antique shop in Manchester and goes to the countryside to spend time with friends, but at a gas station his motorcycle is accidentally damaged by fellow motorist Edna (Cristina Galbo). George commandeers Edna's car and demands that she take him to his destination. When they become lost, George leaves Edna alone in the car and asks for directions from a neighbor, a local farmer who is using a strange looking machine; he tells George it is a newly invented form of pest control, which creates a radiation that attacks the nervous systems of insects and causes them to cannibalize one another until the population is eliminated. The environmentally-conscious George is suspicious of the machine, but the men operating it insist it is perfectly safe and has no effect on human beings. Back at the car, a sinister waterlogged man (Fernando Hilbreck) attacks Edna, but when she returns with George and the farmer, the man is gone.Meanwhile, Edna's sister Katie (Jeannine Mestre) lives nearby with her husband, Martin (Jose Lifante). Katie is a recovering drug addict who has secretly relapsed; when she sneaks out to their shed to do heroin, the weird man who attacked Edna is there and comes after her. The man murders Martin and chases Katie, but he is warded off by the arrival of George and Edna, who discover Martin's corpse. When the authorities arrive, the cynical inspector (Arthur Kennedy) is suspicious of George, Edna and especially Katie, who he claims murdered Martin due to her drug addiction. Katie suffers a breakdown and is hospitalized. When Edna and George go to the hospital, they discover the staff in a panic because several newborn infants have attacked staff members, bloodying them. The doctor has no explanation, but when George tells him about the machine he saw the farmer and his crew using, he asks George to take him there, where he questions them about it. The doctor theorizes that the machine, designed to attack the nervous systems of lower forms of life, may also affect babies.Later, a local druggist hears Edna describe the man who attacked her and identifies him as Guthrie, a vagrant who recently drowned. Theorizing that the man may still be alive, they seek out his last known whereabouts, the local cemetery where he was being prepared for burial. When George and Edna go searching there, they find the place deserted, but while searching for the caretaker they are attacked in a workshop by Guthrie, who they now recognize is a zombie that has been reanimated by the farm machine. Their exit is blocked, but they are able to fend Guthrie off, so he reanimates two other corpses by putting some of his blood on their eyes. With three zombies now, the situation becomes more dire. George and Edna escape through a grate, but are chased back inside by the zombies, along with a police officer sent by the Inspector to check up on George and Edna. The zombies kill and eat the policeman, but George and Edna escape after they set the zombies on fire. George tells Edna to drive her car back to the cottage where he will meet her after taking the policeman's car to go destroy the radiation machine, but as she drives off, he realizes the keys are missing and he is forced to get there on foot. The machine operators tell George that they've increased the influence of the radiation up to a five mile range, which infuriates George even further. They flee after George violently disables the contraption, forcing him to set out again on foot. The Inspector arrives at the cemetery and discovers the carnage, blaming the entire thing on George and Edna and vows to apprehend them.At the cottage, Edna discovers the remains of a policeman killed by Martin's now-roving corpse, and Martin attacks her as well, but she gets away and is rescued by George. They take the car to a local gas station, where George leaves Edna and returns to burn Martin's corpse before it can reanimate any more ghouls, but the police are waiting for him instead and arrest him. They inform him that Martin's corpse, now dormant due to George disabling the machine, has been taken to the hospital in Manchester, where George fears it could reanimate others.When the machine is repaired by the operators, the corpses at the hospital come back to life and go on a violent rampage, murdering and cannibalizing several hospital employees. George escapes from the police station and races off to the gas station to reclaim Edna, but the proprietor informs him that Edna's been taken to the hospital as well. Now realizing Edna is in danger, George drives off to rescue her and Katie, who is also there after her own breakdown.
Katie is attacked and transformed by the zombies, and she goes into Edna's room to murder her, too. The other zombies arrive and surround Edna, while George appears and sets them on fire. Pulling Edna from the room, he is horrified to realize she's dead and has been reanimated, too. Hurling her back into the burning room, she reaches out to him, seeming to recognize him as she burns. George is suddenly shot dead by the Inspector, who has arrived with police backup. With all the zombies burned, the Inspector is still able to deny George's wild story, but when he arrives back at his hotel, he is confronted by George's reanimated corpse, which strangles him to death."

She runs away from home, is raped, becomes a single mother, criminal and glamorous model before her inevitable rendezvous with the electric chair...—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> Dave Davenport is an overweight, angry teenager who loathes school along with her 2 friends. It's nearly Christmas and all she wants is cha-cha heels. When she doesn't get them for Christmas, she abandons her conventional suburban house and makes love with a greasy guy named Earl. She later gives birth to a daughter she names Taffy who she doesn't show her any respect. All Dawn does is commit crimes and gets her hair done at a saloon run by a married couple name the Dashers who believe in crime and beauty. They have Dawn become a crime model while Taffy and next door neighbor Ida Nelson try to stop her.—Josh R.S. Lech Dawn Davenport (Divine) is a rebellious bad-girl teenager who smokes cigarettes, uses hairspray, and doesn't care about school. Dawn and her two best friends, Chicklette (Susan Walsh) and Concetta (Cookie Mueller), discuss the upcoming Christmas holiday. All three of them intend on using Christmas simply for financial gain, but Dawn has something particular in mind; she has requested ""cha cha heels"", and she assures her two friends that there will be trouble if her parents let her down.Christmas morning, Dawn's very square parents wake her up to open presents, and Dawn makes a beeline for a certain package the size of a shoebox; it does contain shoes, but not cha-cha heels. ""Nice girls don't wear cha-cha heels!"" exclaims Dawn's father, but Dawn is furious. She stomps on the rest of the Christmas presents, hurls her mother into the Christmas tree, and curses her parents, running away from home.Outside in her nightgown, coat and slippers on Christmas morning, she is picked up by a sleazy-looking man named Earl Peterson (also played by Divine). Earl takes her to a dump and has sex with her on a dirty mattress, and Dawn steals his wallet. Nine months later, Dawn is living in a cheap hotel and very pregnant. She phones Earl at work and demands money, but he hangs up on her. Dawn stumbles back into the hotel and immediately gives birth to a baby girl she names Taffy, cutting the umbilical cord with her own teeth.Years later, Taffy is an obnoxious preteen girl, and Dawn is working in a number of jobs, including a waitress, a stripper, and a prostitute. She also is a petty thief, working together with Chicklette and Concetta. After Taffy erupts with some particularly annoying behavior, the frustrated Dawn gets Chicklette and Concetta to help chain the child to her bed in the attic. Dawn is despondent about the pressures of being a mother, and Chicklette and Concetta encourage her to pamper herself by getting her hair done at The Lipstick Beauty Salon, where patrons must audition for an appointment.Dawn is immediately favored by the snobbish owners of The Lipstick, Donald and Donna Dasher (David Lochary and Mary Vivian Pearce). She also gets her hair done by Gator Nelson (Michael Potter), who proposes marriage the same day. Gator just happens to be Dawn's next-door neighbor, where he lives with his Aunt Ida (Edith Massey), an obese, elderly woman who dresses outrageously and encourages her nephew to be gay. Aunt Ida is heartbroken when Dawn and Gator get married, and she clashes with Dawn repeatedly thereafter.Dawn and Gator are married for five years before things start to fall apart. Gator cheats on her with various women, while Ida harasses her by doing things like dumping garbage in her back yard. Taffy grows into a strange teenager who likes to play ""car accident"", where she re-enacts fatal car crashes using props. One day, after a bad fight with Gator (he places a carrot in Dawn's mouth during sexual climax), Dawn goes to get her hair done and is called into the private quarters of the Dashers, who inform her that they want her to be a model for them. The Dashers are obsessed with crime and feel that it is connected to beauty, and they ask that Dawn be their ""crime model"". In return, she gets special treatment and they immediately honor her request to fire Gator.Gator becomes enraged and decides to leave Baltimore for Detroit, so that he can become part of the auto industry. Aunt Ida, who is still trying to fix Gator up with other men, becomes insane with sadness. Before Gator leaves, he punches Dawn in the face and gives her a black eye. The Dashers join her at her home for dinner that evening and are thrilled by her black eye, photographing it. Taffy embarasses Dawn by starting an argument, and Dawn smashes a chair over her back, rendering her unconscious. The Dashers are thrilled, photographing the fight, but they are even more excited when Aunt Ida forces her way into the house and hurls acid in Dawn's face, scarring her for life.After Dawn recovers from her wounds, her face is horribly mutilated, but the Dashers convince her that her wounds are 'beauty marks', and she refuses plastic surgery. They also redecorate her home and buy her new clothes. Dawn's final treat is Ida herself, kidnapped and imprisoned in a bird cage for Dawn's amusement.Taffy enrages Dawn by insisting that Dawn tell her the whereabouts of her father, Earl, but when Taffy finds him, he makes drunken sexual advances towards her. As a result, Taffy stabs him to death and runs from the scene.The Dashers escalate their experiment with Dawn, injecting her with liquid eyeliner and telling her it is like drugs. Dawn is so influenced by them that she no longer knows what is real and what isn't. They design a stage show for her, and on opening night she is visited backstage by Taffy, who has converted to a hare krishna. Dawn strangles her to death in front of the Dashers and her friends, who cheer her on. On stage, Dawn fires a gun into the crowd, killing an audience member. A riot breaks out, with several more audience members killed in the melee. The Dashers are arrested, but Dawn escapse and hides out in the woods. She isn't a fugitive for long; she is found and brought back to Baltimore for trial.Dawn feels no remorse for her crime, considering the trial the highest reward for her 'career', but she is outraged when the Dashers turn tail and try to deny their involvement in everything. For their testimony they are granted immunity, and Dawn gets the death sentence. Her stint in jail leads her to believe she is a superstar, and her criminal celebrity will endure after she is dead. As they strap Dawn into the electric chair, she launches into a speech where she thanks everybody for this crowning moment, and they throw the switch, killing her."
Phase IV,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070531/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,Desert ants suddenly form a collective intelligence and begin to wage war on the inhabitants. It is up to two scientists and a stray girl they rescue from the ants to destroy them.
The Arena,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069729/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When the Romans force a group of sex slaves to become gladiatrices, two such fighters - a Nubian dancer and a Gaulish priestess - form an alliance to lead the others in rebellion. Two thousand years ago, the people of Rome are so blasée, so used to violence, that entertaining them becomes a political problem. Someone suggests, after a hectic girl fight in a kitchen between a Nubian and a Viking slave, as a joke, that they should fight in the arena, instead of male gladiators. The idea is approved, though - and a female ""Spartacus"" theme follows.—Artemis-9 Female gladiators fight to the death. Inspired by the story of Spartacus, follow the adventures of a bevy of slave girls who, upon finding themselves thrust into the gladiator ring, mount a vicious rebellion to fight their way to freedom.—Concorde - New Horizons (with permission). Time marks in brackets are from the MGM/UA Home Video (1993) as 'Naked Warriors' - MGM; when different, New Horizons Home Video (1999) - NHHV is indicated.Bodicia (MARGARET MARKOV), priestess of the Great Goddess, wearing a white dress and the hew crown of the tree worshipers, has a slender, well defined body, pale skin, and silver blond hair down to her waist, and her beautiful face brightens with light blue eyes. She is in her homeland, Brittany, performing the initiation ceremony of a young boy, with streaks of red dye across his forehead, cheeks and chin. They are surrounded by his family and tribe, in the middle of a serene wood of large trees. (02:00 - end of title credits)The peaceful rite is disrupted by an attack of Roman soldiers, who quickly and mercilessly, slay men and women who are not quick enough in escaping. Bodicia runs away, leading the boy, trying to protect him, but as he falls, she stays behind for him, and his cornered by four soldiers. Unarmed, she attempts to fight back with a wood pole and her bare hands, is beaten to the ground, and about to die speared through by a soldier, when an officer says, ""She's a nice piece. Save her for the market."" The soldiers handcuff her. She's enslaved, , but not her spirit. (04:10)Mamawi (PAM GRIER) is a beautiful, big breasted young princess, with an Afro-hairstyle and sculptural body she moves in a rhythmic dance to attract her lover, to the music of two drums and one flute, under the palm trees of her free Nubia. Instead of being taken by the man swirling with her to the music, she is taken by the Roman invaders. The soldiers kill her man and two musicians with certain arrow shots, and her big brown eyes open wide in shock, as she sees the last of her faithful men die in agony, his stomach open by a Roman gladius, while two men hold his arms apart. Her thoughts of peace ended then, but the soldiers are too many, they overpower her on the ground. She looks up in defiance at the officer who presses her down, with his sandal on her breast. (06:40; NHHV 05:40)The soldiers take the prisoners to the town of Brundisium, and Bodicia, Mamawi and two other girls, stand on a wood platform at the main street. The slave merchant is shouting to the crowd: ""Four women, each a man's delight!... Young, and not so young... strong, and not so strong... Some have talents on their head (touches Bodicia's tresses with his whip), some have talents here (touches Mamawi's crotch inserting the whip under her short panther fur skirt) Time for bids on the Nubian."" The crowd seems to be interested, but a mannered blond man gets out of a travelling chair, and offers forty Egyptian cesterces of gold for the whole lot. The slave merchant sees the crowd is discouraged by such a high price, and declares, ""They're yours! Handle them with care!"" The effeminate Priscium (SID LAWRENCE) comments, ""I won't handle them at all."" He bought the girls for his master, Timarchus (DANIEL VARGAS), proprietor of the town's gladiatorial arena. The women are forced to march on foot to Timarchus's household. There, the women are instructed that their jobs will be to serve and entertain both the spectators and participants of Timarchus' gladiator extravaganzas. (07:00)""Cornelia! Take care of these creatures,"" says Priscium on arrival. Haughty black haired Cornelia (SARA BAY alias ROSALBA NERY) is Timarchus housekeeper, who is not happy to have those new girls at her charge. ""We have enough kitchen help!"" She asks the girls' names, and tries to suppress the girls' defiance, namely Bodicia's, and she slaps her hard. The Winekeeper (SALVATORE BACCARO) is a plump man, with a big, black hairdo and beard; he is doing kitchen work and does not participate in the reception of the newcomers. .The women introduce themselves...Deidre of the North (LUCRETIA LOVE), a frail looking, curly reddish brunette; Livia daughter of Scipion (MARIE LOUISE), a very beautiful and haughty blonde, who's reminded that ""No one cares who your father was, or you wouldn't be here!"" Then, Bodicia of Brittany, and Mamawi (who will later declare she's from Nubia).Cornelia asks the women ""to get out of those filthy rags, strip!"", to which again Bodicia rebels, ""I'll not!"" Marcus (VASSILI KARAMENSIS aka VIC KARIS aka VIC CARIUS aka MARCOS VICCARIO?), a virile gladiator with black curly hair, in a red loincloth, laughs at Cornelia: ""Hi, Cornelia! Can't you control your silly geese?"" The matron turns to him, and his blonde companion, Wulfstan (IVAN GASPER), in a green loincloth, and demands: ""Would you like to pluck them for me?"" ""Can we expect them for dinner tonight?"" asks Wulfstan, assuming the custom of gladiators being entitled to sleep with girls the night before an arena fight. ""Ah, we haven't cleaned them yet,"" answers Cornelia. The two young men come forward, and rip the women's clothes. The more reluctant ones are Bodicia, whom Marcus must wrestle to the ground, profiting to rub his body against her nude breasts; and Deidre, who suffers the same fate under Wulfstan. The male gladiators were about to rape the girls if Cornelia didn't stop them, sending them away, and leaving the girls to be brutally washed by two kitchen helpers. (10:20)The next morning. The women are receiving new instructions on the patio adjacent to the arena, while the sounds of fighting, and the crowd, are heard over the walls. (Both video editions lack the arena duel between Marcus and Wulfstan, a fight to which the crowd remains aloof, even when Marcus runs Wulfstan through with the sword. Since these were inserted between the women's dialogue, so did the dialogue disappear, but for the last sentence.) ""Our patrons expect good service!"" Two kitchen maids are plucking a chicken, and washing the blood into a bucket full of hot water. (Missing in both versions: the quick transition to the arena, where Wulfstan falls onto his back, groaning, with Marcus' sword sticking up from his belly.)Timarchus' gladiator spectacles are not as popular as they used to be. It appears that the people of Brundisium have grown bored with the redundancy of two men fighting to the death. Timarchus is leaving the arena with his friends Lucilius (PAUL MÜLLER), Lucan (ANTHONY VERNON), and Rufinius (DICK PALMER). Rufinius says it was a miserable act again, and the lanista laments the difficulty to find good gladiators those days. ""What can I do - find another Spartacus?"" wails Timarchus. The question is rhetoric, and Lucilius reacts promptly: ""Gods forbid! I lost a small fortune in that revolt."" Rufinius insists the crowd is fed up with the games as they are. Timarchus agrees: ""I need something new, something... really exciting!""The four new girl servants enter the arena to clean the arena's mess, and Bodicia sees Wulfstan, one of the men she had seen the day before, who's dying a slow death from Marcus' sword. She caresses his head as he expires, and Marcus approaches her, pulls his sword free: ""One of us had to die. It is the rule!"" Bodicia shouts at him, ""Who's rule?"" Marcus retorts, ""The rule of the arena. We are gladiators!"" Bodicia stands up, and shouts back at him, ""Slaves!... That's what you are!..."" Meanwhile, others are pulling Wulfstan's corpse out of the arena. (12:20; NHHV 12:50)That evening, Timarchus is offering an orgy to his friends. Food and drink are aplenty, the women and the men lay on comfortable seats and cushions, fondling each others, and eating. Aemilius (CHRISTOPHER OAKES), an effeminate young man, keeps close to Priscium. (A man fondles a standing nude female servant. - NHHV only.) A couple of black musicians are playing, and now he presents his surprise for the evening: a big bird cage made of gold is carried into the large room by four male slaves. (The cage enters from the right side; in NHHV the scene is filmed from different angles.) Mamawi comes out, in a blue silk bra and her crotch and back ornate with feathers of tropical birds, followed by Bodicia, in a simple white tunic. Mamawi's luscious body can't resist the rhythm of the drums, even touching her crotch lightly as her hips roll all by themselves. Bodicia watches disapprovingly, employed as wine servant. A burly man, already drunk, fondles Bodicia, and she slaps him. Lucilius can't stand the sight of Bodicia, and throws himself at her. ""I'll teach the bitch!"" There's a confused struggle, while he dominates and strips her, and strips his clothes. Soon, his hairy chest is upon her, as he rapes her right there in front of everybody, despite her continuous and useless attempt to fight him back. Mamawi watches disapprovingly, her dance forgotten... (15:30; NHHV 16:20)The slave girls are watching the morning training of the gladiators. Septimus (PETER CESTER), a bald, strong, and experienced gladiator, is the trainer, and he corrects the positions of a square shouldered, Tall Gladiator (PIETRO TORRISI), and Quintus (JHO JENKINS), a black man. The Winekeeper doubles as gong man, using a sword on a bronze shield... (16:30; NHHV 17:10)The games master announces a special gladiatorial game, devised to liven things up in the small-town arena: a duel of two versus one, and Septimus is chosen to take on Quintus, and Marcus, the winner of the previous gladiatorial fight. Lucinia (MARY COUNT), a curly blonde, hears the announcement when she was busy on the stalls, her 5 year old child by her side; she looks worried for the sake of her man, Septimus, the father of her child. The women know the three men have the right to chose a slave girl for their special night, and Mamawi taunts Bodicia about it: ""Which one do you wish to warm your bed tonight?"" The blonde does not answer, but her eyes are riveted on Marcus, who in turn stares at her. Livia's reaction: ""Oh Gods! Do you mean we have to satisfy their animal heat?""Priscium, followed by the always silent Aemilius, visits the women in the evening, saying that the gladiators want ""fresh blood"", and announces their choice: Deidre, Bodicia, and Mamawi - to be paired respectively with Septimus (despite his long relationship with Lucinia), Marcus, and Quintus. (18:40; NHHV 19:20)Bodicia visits Marcus in his cell, and finds him in grief for having killed his companion, and now he expects to die soon. He sends the blonde away, but she calms him down, gives him courage: ""You might well win, I'll pray for you."" They end up making love.Mamawi goes to the room of Quintus, a fellow Nubian, and immediately upon her entrance, he attacks her. He forces her onto her back on the wood table, but she grabs a ragged piece of clay dish, puts it to the husky black man's throat, and thus subdues him. She shouts at him, ""Quintus, the Romans have taught you to live like an animal, have they also taught you to forget your past?"" She slaps him, he looks remorseful for about a minute, then she proceeds to teach him how to make sweet love. Their love scene in the nude is filmed in parallel with Bodicia's. (Septimus session with Deidre is omitted from all film versions.) (23:00; NWHP 24:00)Mamawi, Bodicia and Lucinia watch the special fight, while serving drinks to the spectators on the stalls. Deidre drinks as much as she serves... Marcus fights as a Thracian, with small round shield and a short sword, and Quintus as a retiarius, with the classic trident and a fishermen's net. Septimus is also armed as a Thracian, no extra protective armor, but he is quick and strong enough to sustain a double attack, as he shows more than once. Septimus throws Marcus away with a brutal shove, and turns round swiftly, going inside Quintus' defense. With the shield, he deviates the net to his far left, and quickly thrusts his sword arm low under Quintus' shield. The black man gapes in awe, and Mamawi suspends her action in disbelief. The powerful black gladiator falls to his knees, and rolls aside, his belly open, dying. Septimus sword is already clanking on the small bronze shield Marcus presents to defend himself. It is a quick thrust and parry game, but the young man has not enough strength to keep the big man away for long. Step by step, Marcus finds himself pressed back against the wood wall of the arena, his sword engaged with Septimus' in an ultimate test of strength. Septimus is taller, too, and his sword presses down on Marcus' sword, between their bodies, until he can simply deflect his movement - forward instead of downward. Septimus impales his blade deep through the curly haired man's stomach (off camera), and pulls it off quickly. Marcus remains a moment up against the wall, holding his vitals with his hands, than his knees buckle, and then he falls flat on his face on the sand, dead. Lucinia is relieved, Deidre tipsy, and Bodicia in shock. (24:20; NWHP 25:40)In the sauna, the Roman nobles are considering other possibilities to enliven the shows, possibly nude gladiators, or fights with strange animals, such as snakes, and elephants... In Timarchus' kitchen, the slave girls are talking about the show. Cornelia is all praise for the great show. Bodicia says in a rage, ""Blood thirst animals!"" The matron advises her: ""The gladiators wouldn't like to hear that."" Bodicia's retort brings laughs among the other girl slaves: ""I meant the spectators!"" Livia, always proud of her ancestry (though her father had certainly sold her to pay his debts) intervenes: ""Those are Roman citizens, they own the world!"" The black panther retorts: ""Romans are pigs!"" and she throws each word into Livia's face. Livia steps back, and answers with composure, ""I admit it was a bit undignified... After all, the first one Septimus killed was only a... black."" The racist hint is the last drop in Mamawi's cup. For the sake of Quintus lovemaking, and his dignified combat, the Nubian jumps at the blonde's throat. Bodicia tries to stop her, holding the furious woman by her shoulders: ""Leave her, she's only one of us!""Mamawi, in a short blue tunic, vents her repressed rage on Bodicia, in a long white tunic. They fight hand to hand in the middle of the kitchen, clamp on strong headlocks, and grind away at each other, while the other girl slaves and kitchen maids throw flour pots and other kitchen implements at each other. Cornelia, in a dark blue dress, tries to intervene, but Deidre trips her, and the beautiful matron sprawls on the dirty ground, smearing her face. Deidre is showered by chicken dung while hidden under the table. Chairs, tables and food are strewn everywhere as the women ruthlessly brawl. As Bodicia answers Mamawi tit for tat, at a point dueling with big wood spoons and pan covers as shields, the violence communicates itself to the older maids and the other women slaves. [The fight is mostly off camera, in the middle of a great confusion that completely wrecks the kitchen. TV format reduces the spectator's ability to follow the simultaneous action in the large kitchen, possible in the theatrical version.] Maid #1 fights Tall Brunette (ANNA MELITA), in a fight as long and fierce as the black vs blonde fight; Maid #2 fights Tall Blonde, and Maid #3 fights Curly Blonde. Livia, in light pink dress, lovingly wipes Cornelia's face, both hidden under the table now. Lucinia and Deidre keep out of the brawl too, and Deidre finds some wine to drink.The house master calls for Aemilius (mispronouncing the last syllables, as in ""lie/yous"" instead of ""lee/yous"") who appears with Priscium and Rufinius, but neither of them are men enough to dare go into the middle of ten brawling women. Septimus appears from his holiday, with flowers for Lucinia. Timarchus tells him that for all he knows, she may be dead in the kitchen brawl, and Septimus goes in, grabs Mamawi and Bodicia by the neck, and pulls them apart. Their fierce mutual headlock had depleted both girls of the last of their energy, and they slump to the ground at the same time, knocked-out.Rufinius puts forward an idea: seeing the way the raging she-cats fought, why not presenting them as female gladiators? It would be, he says, ""the return of the Amazons, barbarian women pitted against each other in the ultimate test of the arena."" Timarchus accepts the suggestion, admitting it could have some degree of success with the jaded crowd. (29:30; NHHV 30:50)Next day, the girls find themselves in the arena to be trained in armed combat by Septimus, side by side with their male companions. Bodicia and the Tall Brunette, the Tall Blonde vs Curly Blonde (too briefly in video, then the camera pans to) a longer engagement between Livia in white tunic vs Mamawi in red tunic. (NHHV is a different version, filmed with different clothes, but the same script.) With dexterity, Livia disarms Mamawi, and trips her. Mamawi looks up at her, still unable to understand how it happened so fast, and Livia puts her sandal on the black's bosom, looking around the arena for the applause of her 'victory'. Mamawi was not playing to gladiators' rules, she twists under Livia's leg, and bites her, then pulls her quickly down on top of her, and tangles with her in an all-in fight, pulling hair, punching and kicking, until they are separated by Septimus. ""Mamawi! What sort of conduct is this?"" demands the trainer. Mamawi recalls the Romans treacherous attack on her peaceful tribe, and answers, head high, chest shivering with emotion: ""Roman!"" (31:10; NHHV 32:40)The Tall Gladiator, fighting as a Thracian, dispatches his Murmillo opponent in a short fight, and the spectators are booing, voting death to the defeated, despite his courageous performance. (scene missing from both video versions) The corpse of the myrmillo is dragged out of the arena, still with his closed helmet on, with holes for the eyes only.The first pair of gladiatrixes is called: Bodicia and Deidre, with long swords. An ill omen... Bodicia is reluctant to attack, as she sees that Deidre is drunk, but after some feints and a few twinkles of the swords, Deidre trips and falls, loses her sword, and Bodicia waits for her to pick it up, and return to the (mocked) fight. Deidre plunges forward, saying, ""Common Britty, fight!"" and as Bodicia simply steps aside, she falls flat on her face. Bodicia had vowed she would refuse to execute a death sentence, preferring to die by the soldiers' arrows. But she puts up a happy smile, puts her sandal on Deidre's rump, and lifts up her sword. Crowds are unpredictable, and because they had seen a fun show, gladiatrixes in short tunics and half-bare chests, they were rolling in laughter and asks for clemency. Timarchus, nonchalantly, and to Bodicia and Deidre's relief, gives them the thumbs up signal. (34:30; NHHV 36:10)Bodicia refuses to be acclaimed as female gladiator champion by her comrades, saying graciously that ""Deidre fell victim to Bacchus, not to me."" Cornelia announces, with obvious relish, that next week, ""The special attractions will be Mamawi, and... Livia!"" The night before the event, Lucinia wakes up with a nightmare (topless in bed), and tells Septimus that she is afraid she will die in the arena, in the coming fight. He dismisses her fear, for she has not been chosen to fight. (38:00; NHHV 39:50)The opening male combat is a classic Thracian vs Myrmillo fight. The men fight longer than usual, both sustain several wounds, and keep on fighting, bravely. They are too tired, and losing so much blood from their wounds, and neither is able to finish the other. They teeter on their legs, sway apart, and fall onto the sand, groaning and dying slowly of their wounds, but without a clear decision of the fight. Too bad for the betting, and for the crowd's state of mind, when Mamawi and Livia, each a perfect epitome of beauty, walk to the balcony overlooking the arena, to salute the noble Romans. Mamawi has her breasts encased in a thin white bandage firmly crossed around her chest, a leather cinch belt, and the left arm protected by chain mail, a red loincloth, a trident and a small round shield. Livia is in a white loincloth and similarly bandaged breasts, holding her bright silver myrmillo helmet by her left side, the gladius on her right. (38:40; NHHV 40:40)Rufinius stands up, already drunk, and shouts at the women: ""Name yourselves!"" Mamawi intones clearly, in her slightly deep voice, ""Mamawi of Nubia!"" Her big brown eyes are serene. Livia claims, in her high tone voice: ""Livia, child of Scipion...and a daughter of Rome!"" Her big blue eyes travel around the arena, taking in the complicity of her white co-citizens. After a heated, shouted debate, the majority asks Timarchus, ""Get another!""A quick substitute is to be provided. Priscium is at a loss, all the other gladiatrixes are occupied, distributing wine in the spectators' stalls, too difficult to bring them down in a hurry... Then he thinks of Lucinia, she is a bit older than the other girls, but she is no less attractive, and strong. Lucinia goes through a quick process in her dark slave chamber, to dress her up as a gladiatrix, in front of her five-year-old girl. Stripped (seen from the waist up), dressed in fighting white bandages to form a top, and a loincloth, leather belts, arm and shin protectors, and a helmet with gay bird feathers that will prevent anyone from recognizing her - except for Septimus, who is familiar with her body, and watches in despair from behind an iron grid, as Lucinia enters the arena.Mamawi has excelled as a retiarius, and she fights Lucinia, who is armed with a short gladius and a small, round shield. They put up a good fight, but the crowd is still riled with the poor result of the men's duel and wants to see blood. When Lucinia is disarmed, and beaten down with the pole section of the trident, she falls sideways, and lays supine. Mamawi presses the three-pronged fork to her opponent's heaving breasts, and looks up - hoping for the games' master favor again. Lucinia plays for the crowd the last of a defeated gladiator's crowd, she takes her helmet off, exposing her anguished, beautiful face for all to see, and have mercy. Mamawi understands that almost no one paid attention to her game of death - most spectators, in the stalls and in the stand, are drunk, betting, petting, and the few that were paying attention want to see blood. As much as Timarchus may wish to spare a gladiator's life, and he enjoyed her performance and her looks, he dares not oppose the verdict of the crowd - thumbs down. Mamawi refuses, thus enraging the crowd, and Timarchus, who repeats the order, and then orders the archers to enforce it. The first arrow wounds Mamawi in the upper arm, and a second arrow will not miss her chest. More intent to live then to abet by ideals of friendship, she pushes the trident down with her full might, finishing her comrade as quickly as she could. Then Mamawi walks out, her eyes lowered, struggling not to cry out loud her physical and emotional pain. (43:30; NHHV 45:50)In the women's quarters, Livia accuses Mamawi of murdering Lucinia, to which Mamawi replies, tearful: ""I didn't murder her, she was armed and she tried to kill me!"" Livia, cynically: ""She wasn't armed when you killed her..."" Mamawi begs the forgiveness of her comrades, recalling how she did it only to save herself, after the soldiers started shooting arrows at her. Priscium enters then, and announces a new special, the winners of the first two combats, Bodicia and Mamawi.Bodicia surprises everyone when she demands her right to chose a man for her last night, like a male gladiator would. ""Who's going to be the lucky man... or woman?"" Priscium asks her. ""Septimus,"" the girl answers, surprising the others even more. Deidre objects that it makes three fights in the same week, more than the usual, and Cornelia tells her they should thank their Roman patrons who asked to see more of them fighting. Then, Cornelia takes off her leather belt, and whiplashes Deidre severely, as the other women get out for their chambers. (NHHV filmed differently)Septimus is crazy with grief, and Bodicia sympathizes with him, ""She gave you a child..."" then leads him further in that mind track with her conservative speech: ""That men should fight and die seems only natural. But women?..."" She finds no difficulty to enlist his help in organizing a break-out of the female slaves through the underground tunnels between the wine cellars and the distant shore, where they would get a boat to leave Brundisium. Her last words are: ""Do it for Lucinia!""Next night, Mamawi surprises Livia in her bed: ""One sound and you're a dead Roman."" Mamawi puts the blonde in a strong head and arm lock, and forces her to go with the escaping girls to the entrance of the wine cellar, and explains, ""She's less dangerous if she is with us."" They set in the darkness, waiting for Septimus. However, instead of just taking some weapons and meet the girls as arranged, Septimus tries to murder Timarchus, breaking into his bedroom. (Cornelia discovers his intention, and prepares an ambush for him with the centurion (JANN FOX) - a scene omitted in both video editions.) Septimus is arrested. (53:30)Cornelia is happy when she announces to Bodicia and Mamawi, while they are stripped, about to put on their armor, that the master escaped a death attempt the night before, and will consider giving freedom to the winner of the women's fight, if - and she underlines it briskly - ""if it is a good fight!"" First, Deidre tries to make a joke of it, claiming with her gladius raised: ""Those who are about to die, salute you!"" Then, suddenly somber, and very much in control, she says: ""Only the loser will be free."" Mamawi has the last word, ""I'll be free, my way!..."" Meanwhile, the Centurion escorts Septimus with a handful of soldiers to the main road, and a new post is erected to crucify him. He pleads with the captain of the guard, ""A man should die as he lived!"" and the loyal soldier gives his gladius to the courageous man, who falls upon the sword, taking his own life in honorable fashion. (55:50; NHHV 58:20)The initial duel between men ends, another lifeless body is carried out of the arena, and the two beautiful gladiatrixes are still discussing what they should do in case of victory, without Bodicia being able to convince Mamawi that it was wrong to kill. ""What do you suggest then, that we kill each other?"" Mamawi ripostes, ""It may come that it will be you to decide who shall die!..."" Bodicia, counters coldly, ""Alright, we'll do it your way."" Another match is called, matching very distinct weapons, gladiatrix vs retiarius, idealist vs materialist, blonde vs black - wearing distinct loincloths - green for Bodicia, red for Mamawi - but ultimately beauty versus beauty, slave against slave. They salute the Emperor in the person of Timarchus, and he signals the beginning of their end by letting his delicate white handkerchief fall. (56:40; NHHV 59:30)They stare at each other, circling slowly, then they engage, and both fight hard, and well. Their blades meet, echoing three, four, five times as they attack and parry their mortal thrusts. Then, Mamawi takes the offensive, and six times the trident hits the small leather shield, with a dull sound. Bodicia knows she can not hold much longer the impact of the powerful Negress's strikes, and she counter-attacks, three thrusts that Mamawi takes again on her small bronze disk. The short gladius forced the blonde to come close to the retiarius, and quickly danced aside to prevent being trapped by the long reaching net. Bodicia elected to go in on the left side, exposing herself to the trident, rather than the net, and Mamawi had assumed the contrary, usual escape. Therefore she threw her net to the right, too far, and lost it. She promptly beats the shield away from Bodicia's left wrist, with a strong downward stroke of the trident. The women face each other without protective weapons either than their sandals, leather belts, and Mamawi's left arm chain mail. The blonde attacks in despair, and the Nubian is forced to her knees. The peaceful priestess, in the heat of the battle, disengages her gladius and strikes to the black woman's chest, but Mamawi strikes low with the pole hand of the trident and the blonde stumbles back, hurt. The black panther is swiftly up and goes after the blonde, who trips and defends three successive attacks with her gladius, until her hurt wrist can't hold her bronze blade any longer, and she loses her weapon. She ramps back on her rump, looking up at the savage Nubian, until she has her back against the wall - like Marcus in his last fight. There is no pleading in her eyes, only resignation. There is no scorn in the black woman's eyes, only rage and frustration, as she presses the tridents' deadly fork to her opponent's chest.The thumbs down comes, and Mamawi relives in a second the moment of her first kill. Now, she decides she can not massacre such a loyal girl as the blonde. She shouts, ""Freedom!"" Timarchus tells Rufinius to give the order to the soldiers, and he does. But the archers have been overpowered by the wine-servant girls, and now they shoot Rufinus, instead. (A few guards had been drugged with wine provided by the tricky Deidre, and their positions had been taken by slave girls in disguise. - Not shown in the video editions.) Deidre plays her last trick, shoving Timarchus off the platform, making him break his head on the sandy arena. (60:00)All hell breaks lose, in the arena, and on the stand. The spectators became an enraged mob, eager to see blood, incensed by too much alcohol, and demand that the master fights. Bodicia offers Timarchus her sword, so he can defend himself against Mamawi, and he abjectly refuses, sobbing like a child, on his knees. Mamawi impales the man through the chest with all her might. Timarchus collapses on his face, when Mamawi pulls her weapon off him, and Cornelia screams at the loss of her man (their sexual bond had been established earlier, in the conversation about the escape attempt, missing in both video versions). (62:20)A riot starts in the slaves quarters, and some enter the arena. Several soldiers come into the arena to get the two gladiatrixes, and four are taken down by the certain arrows of the Tall Brunette and the Tall Blonde, and two other women in soldier's uniform, except for their helmets and red togas. These women now descend to the arena, to give a hand to the male gladiators. In the arena, a number of individual duels are taking place and, as in a battle, each victor soon finds him or herself facing another opponent.Bodicia guts two soldiers in quick succession. (One only in NHHV.) Deidre is not faring badly, tripping one soldier, then seating astride him, and strangling him with the aid of a trident across his throat. Cornelia, in a purple dress, descends to the arena, and cries over her husband's body. A number of excited citizens jump from the stalls into the noble's stand, and grab Priscium and Livia, who were trying to escape. Bodicia engages and kills another soldier with the gladius. Lucan, in a yellow toga, jumps to the arena, and tries to make himself scarce - but Mamawi stops his escape with the trident. He offers her a purse with money, and she crushes his testicles with a swift hit of the trident's shaft. Priscium is thrown down to the arena (not to be seen again in any version of the movie). Aemilius escapes to ask for reinforcements from the army detachment that had gone out of the town to crucify Septimus. (65:00; NHHV 68:00)The Tall Brunette gladiatrix and the Tall Gladiator are doing particularly well. Mamawi spits her trident through a soldier's throat. Cornelia kisses her dead husband on the lips. (These three scenes are missing in both video editions.),Cornelia arms herself with a gladius lost by her dead man, stands up, her eyes dry, her stance determined for revenge. The Tall Blonde in soldier's uniform dispatches one soldier and turns around, just as Cornelia slashes downwards at her chest. The blonde staggers, dead on her feet, and collapses. Cornelia walks to Deidre, to take her from the back as she is engaged in a sword duel with a soldier. Mamawi kills Cornelia, impaling her through the back with her trident.Deidre never knew how she had escaped, as she makes her first arena kill, besting the soldier she was fighting... Mamawi kills another soldier. Bodicia and Mamawi kill the last two soldiers - but there are not many slave survivors of the arena carnage. On the balcony, Livia screams, while one Roman rapes her (only in NWHP, although shortened and without the soft-core close-ups of the theatrical showing), while three other men hold her head and arms. (67:00; NHHV 70:00)The survivor slaves escape from the arena to a patio where the wine-cellars are. The are hunted by a few Roman knights, and prepare a ambush for them with three gladiator nets. The first three horsemen are thus trapped. The Tall Gladiator jumps onto one, and strangles him (NHHV only). Bodicia and Mamawi kill their men with their respective weapons, the sword, and the trident, and take command of their horses. The Tall Gladiator kills two more knights in quick sword play (missing in NHHV). A Roman archer kills the Curly Blonde gladiatrix with an arrow between her breasts. (69:00; NHHV 72:00)Bodicia impales two other soldiers, and Deidre kills another man, than stops for a drink. Mamawi guts one soldier, and the Tall Gladiator slashes a soldier across the chest. (Deidre kills her second man in the patio. - not shown in NHHV) The Tall Gladiator goes down with a spear impaled through his back. The Tall Brunette guts a soldier, too. She is the last survivor to enter the wine-cellars, after Mamawi, Bodicia, and Deidre. The Winekeeper stood behind at the entrance to the cellars, and one soldier dispatches him with a sword thrust to his stomach, despite he was unarmed. The girls barricade the door from inside, then go down into the deep catacombs. (70:10; NHHV 73:10)Lucilius, the Centurion and a handful of soldiers, arrive. ""Bring the hounds!"" orders Lucilius, who knows the catacombs are too dark and tricky for a man to find his way in or out. Underground, Deidre is suddenly afraid of the darkness: ""There are dead in there!"" Bodicia calms her down: ""The dead don't harm you."" When the first four soldiers catch the fugitives, these were hiding under white blankets, but Deidre was shaking so much in panic that she gave them away. They fight with swords, Deidre manages to kill her opponent, Bodicia and Mamawi each takes one man down, but the Tall Brunette is gutted by her opponent, whom she just wounds (scene cut from both video editions). Her killer doesn't live long though, as Mamawi dispatches him next. Lucilius is getting impatient: ""Are you coming?"" The Centurion explains, ""My forces are expected in Rome."" He shows the written marching orders to Rome, so it is up to Lucilius to quench the revolt until next dawn, if he wants to have the soldiers with him. (72:40; NHHV 76:10)The three fugitives make their way through the darkness. Bodicia leads the way, and almost falls in a deep crevice from wall to wall. She is held up by Mamawi and Deidre, then they have to jump across, as the sounds of Lucilius, soldiers, and their dogs, are heard. Deidre is afraid to jump, and when she does, she misses, and hangs on from Mamawi's hands. The soldiers are finally behind her, and they throw spears and arrows. Deidre is wounded by an arrow, then dies impaled with a spear in her back. Bodicia, wounded in a leg, can't stand, but she grabs some rocks and throws them at the soldiers, ineffectually. The black warrior picks up a lost spear, and sends it across the crevice, taking the archer full in the chest. (The spectators are not shown what happens on Lucilius' side of the tunnel, but apparently the soldiers, the dogs and himself are gone, for the sounds die away.) (74:20; NHHV 77:50)The two women survivors run away, tired, wounded and barely able to carry their gladius - but they think they are left alone at last. There is even light at the end of the tunnel... Lucilius the rapist, left alone by his soldiers, catches up with them and, in a surprise attack, almost severs Mamawi's right arm with a swiping sword thrust. Mamawi engages the hated Roman alone, in her last duel. He is too good for her tired arm... Soon he disarms her, she falls, he grins, and slashes hard at her, so hard, and so high, that his sword breaks against the wall. He roars, picks a big rock, and stands above Mamawi, ready to bash her head with it. Bodicia is too hurt to stand up, but she manages to stand just to waist level, against the wall, crawls behind him, and sticks his broken sword through his ribs. The rock rolls on the ground, and he crumples forward, dead.The two women fell into each other's arms in a moment of tenderness. Mamawi applies make-shift bandages to Bodicia's right upper arm (and not on video, left leg), then they walk to the end of the tunnel, out into the wood overlooking a beach, empty but for a rowing boat with two fishermen. Helping each other to keep upright, they march forward. On reaching the sand, Bodicia asks Mamawi, signaling the fishermen: ""Think you can handle them?"" Mamawi smiles back at her former rival, and together they march slowly to the boat, against the sunset. (The End, end credits roll.) (78:00; NHHV 82:00)"

Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071141/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A lonely widow meets a much younger Moroccan worker in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. The wildly prolific German filmmakerRainer Werner Fassbinderpaid homage to his cinematic heroDouglas Sirkwith this update of that filmmaker'sAll That Heaven Allows (1955). A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Moroccan worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise-and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. In Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, Fassbinder expertly wields the emotional power of classic Hollywood melodrama to expose the racial tensions underlying contemporary German culture. Emmi, a German woman in her mid-sixties, falls in love with Ali, a Moroccan immigrant worker around twenty-five years younger. When they abruptly decide to marry, everyone around them seems appalled. When the folks calm down a bit, Emmi and Ali's relationship grows uncertain.—Oliver Heidelbach An older German woman named Emmi (Brigitte Mira) enters an Arabic bar in Germany. The patrons all stare at her as she sits at the nearest table. The bartender (Barbara Valentin) walks over and Emmi explains how she needed to get out of the rain, and asks about the foreign music playing. The bartender tells her that it is Arabic music. Emmi notices that the patrons are mostly Arabic, and proceeds to order a cola. A brunette woman picks a song on the jukebox and suggests that Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) dances with Emmi. As they dance Emmi finds out that Ali is from Morocco and works as a mechanic. He says that he spends most of his time in that bar since Germans do not seem to treat Arabs very well. The whole bar watches as they talk and dance together. At the end of the song Ali and Emmi sit down at her table. Ali pays for Emmis drink and introduces himself. He tells her that everyone calls him Ali. Then Emmi needs to leave Ali offers to walk her home. The whole bar watches as the couple leaves.They arrive at Emmis apartment building and talk for awhile in the lobby. Ali asks her what she does for work, and she reluctantly tells him that she is a cleaning woman. He does not judge her and listens as she talks about her work. She realizes how nice it is to talk to someone, since she is alone most of the time. Emmi invites Ali up to her apartment to have coffee until the rain stops. As they walk up the stairs Emmi is stopped by her neighbor Mrs. Karges (Elma Karlowa) to pay her some money she owes her. As they continue up the stairs Mrs. Karges runs to tell another neighbor that Emmi has gone upstairs with a foreigner. They are disgusted by the idea of such a match.The next scene begins with Ali having a coffee with Emmi in her kitchen. As she gets the brandy she tells him that her husband was a polish worker who stayed in Germany after the war. Her family did not approve since he was a foreigner. She asks about Alis family and he tells her that his parents are dead and that he has five sisters. He tells Emmi he needs to leave but she asks him to stay for another drink. Ali needs to leave or he will miss the last tram of the night. He lives far away and shares a room with five other men. Emmi says that is inhuman, but Ali says that Arabs are not humans in Germany. Emmi decides to invite him over for the night.Ali cannot sleep and asks Emmi if he can talk with her for awhile in her room. He tells how lonely he is, and that maybe he isnt human at all. Emmi comforts him and tells him that that simply isnt true.The next morning Emmi wakes up to find Ali in her bed. At first she cannot believe what has happened and hurriedly leaves the room. She looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, and Ali finds her with tears running down her face. All she sees is her old age, but Ali does not see it. They look at each other and embrace each other. Next Emmi and Ali have breakfast together before they set off for work. She calls herself an old woman, but Ali does not see her as one. He sees her as a good person with a big heart. Emmi is so happy but she starts to cry out of fear. Ali tells her that fear isnt good, that it eats the soul. The two go downstairs together and part ways while Mrs. Karges watches from upstairs.Later that day Emmi is on her lunch break at work. As she eats with her co-workers they get on the topic of foreigners and how they all they care about is money and sex. Emmi tries to defend foreigners but it is obvious that these women will not change their minds about them. They think that a woman should die of shame if she were to ever become involved with such a man.Next Emmi goes to visit her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and her husband Eugen (Rainer Werner Fassbinder). Eugen is home from work on sick leave, and he and Krista keep bickering in front of Emmi. She changes the subject by asking about foreign workers at Eugens job. This upsets him greatly and he barks at his wife to get his cigarettes. Emmi then proclaims she has fallen in love with a Moroccan who is at least 20 years younger than her. Krista and Eugen think she is joking and laugh. She tells them it is no joke and leaves the apartment, but they still do not take her seriously. The whole idea is too unbelievable to be true.That evening Emmi returns to the bar where she met Ali the night before. She sits at the same table and orders a cola. The bartender brings her the drink and states that it isnt raining. She makes it abundantly clear that it was her bar and that Emmi was not welcome in it. Emmi sits there in hopes of running into Ali. She quickly leaves the bar and walks home, where she finds Ali waiting for her outside. They greet each other and go upstairs together.Next we see Emmi and Ali eating together in Emmis kitchen. As Emmi clears the table and gets them coffee Ali tells her that he has money to give her. He wants to pay her back for all the food and drinks she has provided. Emmi thinks that money will spoil their friendship and says she will put the money in a drawer for him when he needs it. Ali wants Emmi to take the money but she utterly refuses. They are then interrupted by Mr. Gruber (Marquard Bohm), the landlords son. Gruber comes by to tell her that she is not allowed to sublet to others and that Ali must move out. Emmi panics and tells him that Ali is not renting from her but they are actually getting married. Since that is the case the matter is resolved, or so Gruber thinks. Once he leaves Emmi tells Ali what she has done, and he thinks it is a good idea. He agrees to marry her and they have a drink before telling the news to his Arab buddies.Emmi and Ali go to the bar and celebrate their engagement with his friends. The brunette that was at the bar in the beginning of the film appears again and she is disgusted by the news. She calls Emmi is a filthy old whore, which then the bartender points out her jealousy. Emmi puts on a song on the jukebox and she and Ali dance to it. The other woman says that it will never work out because it is so unnatural.The next scene begins with Emmi and Ali leaving the courthouse where they have just gotten married. It is only the two of them and they are both dressed in grey suits, and Emmi has a bouquet of red flowers. As they walk together Emmi points out how long her new name is. She is now Emanuela ben Salem MBarek Mohammed Mustapha. She thinks it sounds terrific. They stop at a phone booth where Emmi calls her daughter Krista. She invites her and her two sons over to her house next Saturday. When Krista asks her why Emmi tells her theres no special reason. Emmi sees a taxi and tells Ali to stop it.The taxi then takes them to a restaurant called Osteria Italiana. It is where Hitler used to eat and Emmi had always wanted to eat there. The entire restaurant is empty except for the two of them and the waiter who is staring at them from the doorway. Emmi suggests they order the most expensive things on the menu, since it is such a special day. Ali says he will eat whatever she eats. She calls the waiter over and orders their food. The waiter asks her how she would like the Chateaubriand prepared. She is confused about the question, so the waiter asks if she wants it rare or medium. She tells him rare sounds good. Then she changes her mind once the waiter explains that rare means almost raw. The waiter then asks if they would like an aperitif to start with. Emmi is not sure which one to ask for, so the waiter recommends the house aperitif. After the waiter walks away Emmi says how he really had her on the rack there and it can be difficult if you are not used to things like that. The couple stares at each other and then they both stare forward. The scene ends with them looking ahead through the doorway.Emmis children have come over to her house at her request. Albert, Bruno, Krista and her husband are all sitting in the living room waiting for Emmis announcement. They are all curious as to why she has asked them there, and one of her sons asks if she is ill. Emmi tells them she is not ill but has gotten married. They are all shocked. They ask who she has married, so she calls Ali into the room. She introduces him to the children, who all stare at them with blank expressions on their faces. The room is silent until Bruno walks over to the television and kicks in the glass. He storms out of the apartment and Krista goes after him. Albert stands and tells Emmi that their marriage is a disgrace. She can forget that she has any children, and that he will have nothing to do with a whore. Krista comes back and tells her husband that they are living this pigsty. Once they leave Emmi breaks down into tears.Next Ali is at the local store trying to buy some Libelle margarine. The store owner (Walter Sedlmayr) keeps giving him lemonade even though Ali repeatedly tells him like butter, not lemonade. The owner barks at him to learn German and that he cannot help him. Adele (Doris Mattes) comes out and asks him what Ali wants. He tells her that he wants Libelle, which she says is the new margarine. The owner does in fact know what Ali wanted, but he just refuses to help him. Ali leaves the store.Ali comes home and tells Emmi what has happened. She knows that the owner understood Ali and just didnt want to serve him. She has been a customer at that store for twenty years and is furious. Ali says not to fight, that fighting isnt good. Emmi leaves the apartment to have a word with the shopkeeper.Emmi arrives at the store and Mr. Angermeyer why he wont serve her husband. He says that he couldnt understand what Ali was saying. She tells him that Ali asked for Libelle margarine. He pretends that he didnt know thats what Ali wanted. Emmi knew he understood him perfectly but he just didnt want to help a foreigner. Angermeyer does not appreciate Emmi accusing him of discrimination and that he cannot serve someone who cant speak German. Emmi angrily tells him that is nonsense and that Ali speaks better German than him. This upsets Angermeyer and he bans Emmi from the store.Emmi walks home from the store to find some of the neighbors standing in the stairwell. They stop her and tell her that everyone in the building has agreed that she has to clean the stairwell twice a month instead of their usual system. The three women say that there has been a lot more dirt than usual and that she should clean it since she brought a foreigner home. Emmi tells Mrs. Karges to mind her own business, since she does not meddle in her affairs. Mrs. Karges says that they have nothing to be ashamed of like she does. Emmi accuses her of jealousy and continues up the stairs. Mrs. Karges is shocked by the notion and wonders whatever Emmi could mean by that.Ali comes home to find Emmi sitting in the kitchen. She looks at his paystub and sees that he worked five hours overtime. She jokingly says that she thought he was off boozing somewhere. Ali doesnt understand what she means. Emmi explains herself and he says that he doesnt drink without her. She adds together their earnings and says that they will be rich, and that they will buy a little piece of heaven. He asks her why heaven? and she says it is just a fancy of hers. Ali gets up to take a shower and she offers to make him coffee.Emmi walks into the bathroom and sees Ali in the shower. She looks at him and tells him that he is very beautiful and that his coffee is ready. Ali continues to wash himself.Ali steps out into the kitchen and Emmi hands him his coffee. The doorbell rings and Emmi goes to answer it. Her coworker Paula (Gusti Kreissl) came over to see if Emmi could work her shift for her so she could attend her sisters funeral. She invites her into the living room where she introduces her to Ali. Paula is shocked to find out that they have been married for three months. She quickly excuses herself and says she will ask someone else to cover her shift. Ali says that that woman is no good, but Emmi just writes it off as just shock. He knows that she was disgusted by him and says that she had death in her eye. Emmi tells him he is imagining things and to get dressed. Ali suggests they go out to see his Arab buddies since Germans are not good. Emmi doesnt feel like going out but tells him to invite his friends over to their apartment.Ali goes to the bar to invite his friends over. No one is there yet except for the bartender. As she pours him a beer she asks him if he is happy, to which Ali says he doesnt know. She tells him to come over to her place sometime and she will make him couscous. He tells her that he doesnt know if he will, so she asks him if he is scared of his wife. This upsets him and he says he is not. She again tells him to come over, and he says maybe. One of Alis buddies and the brunette woman walk into the bar. They greet each other and Ali invites them over to his house. The woman says she will not go to that old whores place. Ali grabs her by her dress and tells her that Emmi is not an old whore. He lets her go and the two men walk to the door. They run into two other men on the way out and they all leave for Emmis. The bartender and the woman are left alone watching them leave.Later Mrs. Karges and another neighbor are in the stairwell talking to two police officers. They complain to them that the party going on in Emmis apartment is too loud. They also tell the officers that she has four Arabs in her apartment and that it isnt safe. The officers tell them not to exaggerate and that they will speak with Emmi. They walk up the stairs and the two women stay where they are, commenting on the policemens long hair.Ali and three of his buddies sit in the living room and play a game while Emmi watches. The door bell rings and Emmi goes to answer it. The policemen inform her that the neighbors are complaining about the noise and ask her if she could turn the music down. She agrees and says goodnight to the officers. Emmi walks back into the living room and asks Ali to turn down the music. She tells him that the neighbors have sent the police on them. They look out the window and watch the policemen drive away.Emmi is on her lunch break at work and eats with her coworkers in the stairwell. She asks them to pass her a knife, but all three women ignore her. They talk amongst themselves as if she doesnt exist. She tells them to stop acting so strange and asks them again to pass her a knife. They pretend they dont hear her and carry on their conversation. Emmi stands up and gets the knife herself. As she sits down the women decide to move further down the stairs. They continue talking and leave Emmi all by herself.Emmi and Ali leave their apartment building and walk past Mr. Gruber, Mrs. Karges, and the other neighbor woman. As they walk away Mrs. Karges asks Gruber if there is anything that can be done about them. He does not see a problem with Emmi and Ali as tenants. He says they seem happy together. The second woman does not see their happiness, just how indecent their union is. Gruber does not see anything indecent about the couple, though he says he has tried. He says goodbye to the ladies and departs. Mrs. Karges asks the other woman if she can understand such a situation. She says she does not and goes inside.The couple is sitting across from each other at an outdoor café. They are surrounded by dozens of empty yellow tables. Ali looks behind him and sees a group of people staring at them from the doorway. Emmi tells him to ignore them and that they are just envious. Ali doesnt understand so Emmi explains what envious means. She begins to cry. Emmi is so happy to be with the man she loves, but she cant take peoples judgments anymore. She pretends that peoples hatred doesnt bother her but it really does. She screams at the other people to stop staring at them. Ali comforts her as she becomes hysterical. Emmi suggests they go on a trip together to get away from everyone. Then when they get back everything will be different.The shopkeeper sees Emmi and Ali return from their trip. Adele points out how nice Emmi always was. She figures that the marriage wont last and that he should let Emmi shop there again. The shop needs the business and Emmi was always such a good customer. He decides that he will greet her the next time she walks by the store.Emmi and Ali take their things from the car and start walking upstairs. Two neighbors greet Emmi and wish to speak to her about her cellar. Mrs. Ellis son has been sent to Norway for a year and she needs a place to store his things. Emmi offers her space and promises that Ali will help her move. The woman thanks her and Emmi continues upstairs. As they separate the other two ladies comment on how nice and helpful Emmi is.Back at the apartment Emmi gives Ali the cellar keys and tells him to help Mrs. Ellis. If they are nice to her then she will be nice to them. She says she is going shopping and tells Ali to change his clothes.Adele and Mr. Angermeyer see Emmi walking towards their store. Adele tells him to go outside and talk to her. He greets her and invites her inside the store to tell them all about her trip.Emmis son Bruno walks up Emmis stairwell and is greeted by Mrs. Karges. She tells him that Emmi has returned from her trip and has gone out shopping. He thanks her and she proceeds to tell him about Ali helping Mrs. Ellis and about her son going to Norway. Emmi arrives and Bruno walks with her upstairs to her apartment.As Emmi puts things away, Bruno apologizes for breaking the television set. The children have gotten used to the marriage except for Albert. Emmi forgives him and he then asks her for a favor. His wife is going to start working again and they need Emmi to watch their child for a few hours a day. Ali arrives and Bruno shakes his hand. Ali goes to take a shower. Emmi agrees to Brunos favor and he leaves the apartment. Ali asks Emmi if she is going to make couscous. She tells them that she cannot make couscous and that he should get used to the way things are in Germany. Germans dont eat couscous and she herself doesnt like it. Ali leaves to go meet his Arab buddies and to eat couscous. He does not want Emmi to go with him. After he leaves Emmi is left standing alone in her kitchen, staring at the floor.Ali walks to his usual bar but it is closed. He goes to upstairs to the bartenders apartment. At first he hesitates, but then he rings the doorbell. She asks him if he wants anything to eat or drink, so he says he wants couscous. She tells him to help himself to some fig brandy. Later she finds him in the living room staring out the window. He takes off his jacket and she takes off his shirt from behind. They face each other and hug.Ali returns home drunk. He walks around calling Emmis name and tries to find the bedroom. He finds it locked and passes out on the floor. Emmi opens the door and sees him. She leaves him on the floor and closes the door.The next day they eat together in silence. They look at each other but do not say a word. Ali leaves the apartment while Emmi just stares at the table.At work Emmis coworkers greet her at lunch as if nothing has happened. They tell her that Frieda has been fired for stealing. In her place they have hired a foreign woman named Yolanda from Herzegovina. As they are talking one of the women decide that they should talk further down the stairs away from Yolanda. Then they tell Emmi that they are not getting their raise and that Yolanda makes less money than them. Emmi invites them over to her house to discuss how to get their raise. They decide not to invite Yolanda since she is on a different pay scale than them. Yolanda continues to eat her lunch alone.Later that evening the women show up to Emmis place and they meet Ali. They talk about him to Emmi as if he isnt there. They touch and examine him like some prize animal. He leaves the room and they dont know what is wrong with him. Emmi says its simply his foreign mood swings. She leaves the room to get coffee for the women and sees Ali leave the apartment. Again, they stare at each other and do not say a word. She turns back around and smiles at her friends, even though it is quite obvious that she is not in a smiling mood.Ali arrives at the bartenders apartment. She is just on her way out but she invites him to stay and eat leftover couscous. After she leaves he sits on the couch and looks down at the floor.Emmi thinks she hears Ali walking up the stairs. She opens the door and yells for him but it is just Mr. Gruber. She apologizes and begins to cry. Mr. Gruber says goodnight and leaves Emmi crying in her doorway.Ali wakes up on the bartenders couch just as she arrives home. She asks him to stay over for the night. Ali undresses as she cleans up in the bathroom. She walks back into the room naked and turns off the light before walking over to him. They embrace and lie down on the couch together.Ali is at work and one of his coworkers is telling jokes. His boss walks in with Emmi. She confronts Ali and asks him where he has been all night. She tells him how much she misses him and asks him to come back. He stares at her and says nothing. One of the men asks if that his grandmother from Morocco, and all the men laugh. Emmi and Ali stare at each other and she leaves. After she walks out the men continue to laugh at the joke, except for Ali.Later Ali gambles with is buddies at the bar. After he loses a game he sends one of the men to his house to get more money. The bartender scolds him for gambling away his wages. Ali snaps at her and goes into the bathroom.After using the urinal Ali walks over to the mirror. He stares at himself and slaps himself in the face over and over again.Ali comes out of the bathroom just as his friend returns with his money. He plays another hand and Emmi comes into the bar. She sits at a table and orders a cola. Ali loses again. The bartender brings Emmi her drink and she asks her to play The Black Gypsy on the jukebox. When the music starts to play Ali walks over to Emmis table. He asks her to dance with her. She stands and they walk to the dance floor. As they dance Ali confesses that he slept with another woman. She doesnt care but she says that she cannot stop him from doing that. However, she does want them to get along when they are together. Otherwise life isnt worth living. Ali says he doesnt want anyone else and that he only loves her. Emmi says that she loves him too and that together they are strong. Right then Ali collapses to the floor and groans in pain. Emmi tries to comfort him as the bartender calls an ambulanceAt the hospital the doctor explains to Emmi that Ali has a perforated stomach ulcer. It is very common among foreign workers due to the stress. They can only operate and he will probably have another one in six months. He will recover but the doctor guesses he will be back again. Emmi goes to Alis bedside and holds his hand as she cries."

The Yakuza,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073918/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"American private-eye Harry Kilmer returns to Japan to rescue a friend's kidnapped daughter from the clutches of the Yakuza. Harry Kilmer returns to Japan after several years in order to rescue his friend George's kidnapped daughter - and ends up on the wrong side of the Yakuza, the notorious Japanese mafia...—Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk> The presently private investigator and real-estate agent Harry Kilmer is bonded to Japan culture. In the end of World War II, he was assigned to stay in Tokyo, and meanwhile he felt in love with the Japanese woman Eiko Tanaka. In 1949, her Yakuza brother Ken Tanaka, who was missing in action in Philippines, returns to Japan. Harry proposes to marry Eiko, who is also in love with him, but she does not accept his proposal. With a broken heart, Harry decides to return to United States of America. He borrows some money from his close friend George Tanner, buys a small restaurant for Eiko and her baby daughter, and returns to his home country. After several years, his friend George asks Harry to return to Japan with his bodyguard Dusty to rescue his daughter, who was kidnapped by a Yakuza family, due to a weapon business. While in Tokyo and Kyoto, many revelations are disclosed to Harry about his close friends.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Harry Kilmer (along with friend George Tanner) were in Japan after the war in the Pacific ended. During this time Kilmer met and fell in love with a beautiful Japanese woman named Eiko Tanaka. But for some reason Kilmer cannot fathom and which Eiko will not tell him, she will not marry him. Finally he leaves Japan and returns home to the USA where he does some police and detective work to earn a living.Tanner continues a business relationship with some very shady underworld figures in Japan (the Yakuza) and in particular with the local boss Tono. In fact he is selling guns to this mafia like organization, but on one transaction he fails to deliver. As a consequence the Yakuza kidnap Tanner's daughter and Tanner turns to Kilmer to help him try to recover his daughter safely.So Kilmer returns to Japan to do what he can for his then friend. He visits Eiko of which their mutual love is quite apparent but who will still not marry him. We also meet her brother, Ken Tanaka who once was a Yakuza himself but resigned and became a respectable swordsman instructor in the ancient tradition of Japanese warfare by the sword. Ken is a master swordsman.Ken is a strange man (""he who never smiles""), and only reluctantly helps Kilmer to rescue Tanner's daughter. He does so because of the totally Japanese concept of obligation or rather burden called ""giri"", a social tradition of the old world of Japan.It is by this tradition, in fact, that Ken is bound to assist Kilmer since Kilmer did in fact, save Eikos life during those terrible days after the war. It is then that Ken takes up the sword once again to actually fight (rather than teach), and joins Kilmer in the rescue.The result is a bloody battle to (successfully) rescue Tanners daughter. Unfortunately two of the Yakuza men guarding the captive are killed in the fight, so now the Yakuza, and in particular the boss Tono put a price on heads of both Kilmer and Ken. And while Kilmer can just get on a plane and fly home where the Yakuza will not bother him, Ken is a different story and will definitely die at Tonos bidding.Kilmer decides he cannot do this after what Ken has done for him. He seems to feel the ""giri"" himself and, in fact, feels he is obligated to Ken. They talk it over and decide there is no choice but to try to kill Tono. It is either Ken or Tono, they figure.Kilmer and Ken then undertake the most dangerous venture, to break into and attack the secure Yakuza compound where Tono hangs out along his henchmen. This could be a form of suicide especially since Japanese (and Yakuza) tradition require that Tono die by the sword and not by a gunshot (Kilmer has two or three guns but Ken only his sword). As a Yakuza Ken can only use a sword.They break in and hold the mob at bay briefly. Ken says I come (only) for Tono, but this makes little difference to the mob and a battle ensues where between Ken's master swordsmanship and Kilmer's threatening (and sometimes deadly) gunfire they succeed in wiping out this mob. (Note that the Yakuza gangsters have only swords, no guns.)At some point earlier in the movie we learn of another strange Yakuza custom concerning the custom of ""giri"". If the person who is obligated cannot repay his burden he may make a symbolic offering by severing the one of his small fingers (his pinkie) at the joint and giving it to the person to whom he is indebted. If the person accepts the token of forgiveness of burden then the matter is resolved. We see this ritual twice as Ken offers this ""giri"" to his older brother (who is actually only a brother in the Yakuza sense), but who is socially a prominent businessman and one of enough influence to have covered up the massacres.(NOTE: The following is a serious spoiler-do not read it if you plan to see the movie): Ken (much against) his Yakuza brothers will, performs this ritual and is unhappily forgiven his burden by this brother. Kilmer on the other hand learns something from the brother he could never have imagined. It turns out that the reason Eiko could never marry Kilmer is that she is married to Ken. Ken is actually her husband, not her brother. He had hid in a cave after the war and only several years later found his wife, now comfortably set up with a small tea house business bought for her by Kilmer. Thus when Ken returns this totally torn man must honor Kilmer for saving and then helping his wife because of his ""giri"" and so tells Kilmer that he is her brother.In the end Kilmer takes a taxi to the airport but is himself torn by his ""giri"" to Ken. He tells the cab driver to turn around and goes back to see Ken. Kilmer tells him he came back because there is something important he must talk to him about. This is true, but while Ken goes for tea Kilmer himself performs the ritual of severing his pinky and in the tradition, putting it in a handkerchief, offers it to a shocked, but an emotionless Ken when he returns. Kilmer asks Ken to accept his token of apology for what HE HAS DONE (to Kens life however unwittingly), and asks him to please forgive Eiko as well. Ken, of course accepts, and says the words which seem to be the traditional response ""no man has a greater friend.""Finally the two men with bandaged pinkies go to the airport for a final goodbye and Kilmer leaves, very emotionally, for home."

He tells them and his surprised wife that they are all to stay over a weekend and that all of them will be kept on the estate during that weekend. For each guest, dead bodies have followed in their wake and the way that the dead have been murdered means that one of the guests is a werewolf and Tom has summoned his guests here to discover who it is and to hunt it down.

The entire house is under surveillance by CCTV cameras as well as motion sensors in the grounds around the mansion set up and overseen by Tom's associate Pavel (Anton Diffring), who doesn't believe in werewolves.The only way to determine the identity of the werewolf is submitting the one to the three nights of the full moon while the wolfsbane is mixed in the air. Tom makes them grab silver objects to provoke allergic reactions, but this proves unsuccessful.One night, while Tom makes a patrol around the mansion that picks up something moving, Pavel is killed by the werewolf, which makes Tom more and more obsessive in finding the werewolf, driving his wife crazy.

Dracula thinks about it, then agrees...and possesses Kah's body to do it.Chung King, 1904: Professor Lawrence Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] is lecturing at Chung King University about legends of ancient China. In particular, he mentions Pang Kwei, a village that becomes cursed by seven vampires each year during the seventh full Moon. He relates the story of Hsi Phen An (spelling?), a farmer who attempted to fight against the vampires but was killed in the process. Before he died, however, Hsi Phen An placed one of the golden medallions worn by each of the vampires on a wayside shrine. When the vampire tried to retrieve it, he was destroyed. After listening to Van Helsing's stories, all the students laugh and walk out...except for one. Hsi Ching [David Chiang] is the grandson of Hsi Phen An and proves it by showing Van Helsing the golden medallion. Ching and his family have pledged to rid Pang Kwei of the vampires' curse, but they need Van Helsing's help, so Van Helsing and Ching put together a group of vampire hunters composed of both of them, Van Helsing's son, Leyland [Robin Stewart], Vanessa Buren [Julie Ege] (a rich Scandinavian widow who agrees to finance the trip on one condition: that she is allowed to go with them), Ching's six brothers (the twins Sung [Fong Kah Ann] and San [Chen Tien Loong], Ta [James Ma], Kwei [Liu Chia Yung], Jin How [Liu Hoy Ling] and Bao Kwei [?]) and his one sister Mai Kwei [Szu Shih], each of them skilled in various martial arts.On the road to Pang Kwei, romance blossoms between Leyland and Mai Kwei and also between Ching and Vanessa. Meanwhile, the six remaining vampires attack the village and carry off some of its young girls (true Chinese take-out?). As the group of vampire hunters near the village, it becomes apparent that the vampires know that they are coming. One cold night, the troop takes shelter in some caves, although Van Helsing pronounces the caves to be ""malignant"". Sure enough, while the vampire hunters sleep, they are attacked by bats who turn into the vampires, aided by dozens of their zombie Renfields. Kwei manages to destroy one of the vampires with a bow through its heart. One of the twin brothers destroys another vampire with his sword and Van Helsing sets another vampire on fire and destroys it, leaving three vampires left out of the seven.When the vampire hunters reach Pang Kwei, they devise a security system of wooden stakes and trenches filled with oil. That night, when the three remaining vampires and their zombie Renfields attack, the village is ready for them. They light the oil and pick up their stakes. One of the vampires is destroyed in the burning trenches. Unfortunately, he also kills one of the brothers. Another brother is stabbed to death. The twin brothers die together. Vanessa is bitten by another one of the vampires, then she, in turn, bites Ching. Ching destroys Vanessa by impaling her on a stake and then he impales himself on the stake as well at the same time, then the villagers stake the vampire. Mai Kwei is captured by the seventh and last remaining vampire and taken to the temple where Dracula awaits. Leyland follows it there and tries to rescue her. Just as the vampire seems to be getting the best of Leyland, Van Helsing arrives and thrusts a stake into its heart.But there is still Dracula to be dealt with. After Leyland and Mai Kwei leave the temple together, Van Helsing stays behind and convinces Dracula to leave Kah's body and return to his actual form. A short and anticlimactic fight ensues in which at the end of it Dracula leaps at Van Helsing, who holds up a stake just in time for Dracula to fall onto it, piercing him through the chest and back, then a long and anticlimactic scene follows this one in which Dracula slowly disintegrates into dust, after which Van Helsing leaves the temple as well.

But during the getaway, the thieves car is riddled with bullets from the company's security guards which kill the getaway driver, and damage the car so that it's leaking fuel. The clean-cut, cunning leader of the group, known only as Doc (Maurice Poli), and his two vicious and scruffy cohorts, the knife-wielding Blade (Aldo Caponi) and the hulking seven-foot tall Thirty-Two (Luigi Montefiori) are overjoyed at the stolen cash they now have. But when their car stalls in a downtown part of Rome, they are forced to flee on foot into an underground car park, persuaded by the police. The criminals grab two women as hostages, and when Blade accidentally kills one, the police, seeing the other female hostage Maria (Lea Lander) in danger, back away, allowing the criminals to steal her car and make an escape from the car park.Back on the street, Doc knows that its only a matter of time before a description of their new getaway car will reach the authorities, which will make it impossible for them to get out of the city. But the situation is resolved when they stop at a red traffic light, they hijack the car in front of them. The middle-aged driver of the other car, Riccardo (Riccardo Cucciolla) protests that he has to get his young child, a small, deathly-pail little boy wrapped up in a blanket, to the hospital. But the criminals, plus their female hostage Maria, force Riccardo to drive them out of the city.Once outside the city, Doc forces Riccardo to drive onto a local tollway to Naples which will lead them to their hideout outside that city. But aware that the police will be surveying the toll road for them, Doc forces Riccardo to turn around and exit the toll road, in which they decide to take a few secondary, but slower, roads to get to their hideout.During most the long road journey, Maria cannot stop herself from shaking and quaking with fear, which annoys Blade and Thirty-Two. Riccardo on the other hand, despite being somewhat unnerved and intimidated, takes what's happening to him very calmly. Doc, the most civilized of the criminals, is barely able to keep Blade and Thirty-Two in line who are both frequently fondling Maria who continues to tremble constantly. At a traffic construction site, Doc forces the group to roll their windows up, which attracts some attention for in the middle of a hot summer day, makes some of the motorists in front and behind them to question. But Doc has them roll their windows back down when it makes is look they might be made, and the group continues on.A little later, Maria ask Doc to pull the car over so she can relive herself. But she takes the opportunity to try to escape. She is perused by Blade and Thirty-Two, who chase to a farmhouse, which is unoccupied. Once Maria is re-captured, Blade and Thirty-Two torture the woman, both physically and mentally. Since she used the fact that she has to relive herself as a excuse to try to escape, they force her to urinate in front of them for punishment.Back on a main highway, Riccardo asks Doc if can pull into a rest stop for food and supplies, with Thirty-Two accompanying him, Riccardo buys some sandwiches, soda pop, while Thirty-Two buys a bottle of scotch. When a random woman at the rest area recognizes Riccardo, he manages to shake her off by saying that he's going on a picnic in the countryside with some friends.Back on the road, Thirty-Two becomes very intoxicated from the bottle of liquor he bought, and his actions begin to draw attention to the car from the other motorists. Doc and Blade try to control him, but he gets more and more out of control, and he attempts to rape Maria. Rather than risk attracting the attention of the highway police, Doc suddenly shoots Thirty-Two in the neck. Blade is completely shaken by this, but understands that Doc had no other choice. Thirty-Two does not die, but is completely helpless and immobile. Blade tries to help his friend by banding the bullet wound, but Doc knows that Thirty-Two is as good as dead.Soon after this incident, Riccardo tells them that they need to stop to get gas. However, when they finally reach a rural Esso filling station, the elderly attendant (Francesco Ferrini) tells them that he's on his hour break and won't help them for at least another 20 minutes. Doc, in a hurry to complete their journey, attempts to threaten the old man, who instead pulls a gun on Doc telling them that he was robbed the previous year and cannot be intimidated. Thinking quickly, Blade forces Maria to smooth things over by pleading with the attendant to come out and fill their car so they can get the comatose little boy to a hospital. The old man quickly relents and comes out to fill the car. But soon, another complication arises with the arrival of an overly cheerful young woman (Eriak Dario) who shows up at the station claiming that her car has broken down a kilometer away and needs assistance. Seeing the group, she pressures Doc to give her a ride to the next town where she is heading. When the woman opens the side door to the car, Thirty-Two's hand, covered with his own blood, slumps into view, the woman fails to see this, but the attendant does. Rather than risk a scene, Doc allows the woman to come along with them, and they drive off, with none of them knowing that the attendant saw the near-death Thirty-Two. The old man returns to his office with a shrug.The presence of this female hitchhiker is clearly annoying to Doc and everybody else since she cannot stop talking or ranting about how hot the day is and of the countryside. Ironically enough, the woman is also named Maria. But Maria the hitchhiker is a little too vivacious and outgoing, and her manner clearly has a grating effect on both the criminals and hostages. Maria the hitchhiker is completely oblivious to her situation and when she inadvertently removes the blanket covering Thirty-Two's neck, she notices the bullet wound. Blade kills the annoying hitchhiker by stabbing her in the neck with his signature knife. Doc forces Riccardo to pull over so they can dispose of the body. As the hitchhiker's body is thrown unceremoniously off a cliff, Riccardo helps Blade carry the still breathing Thirty-Two down the bottom of the cliff where Blade shoots his mortally wounded friend in the head to put him out of his misery.The group finally reaches their destination: a ruined villa just south of Naples where Doc has stashed a back-up car, carrying the appropriate papers that will enable him and Blade to leave the country. Riccardo and Maria are elated, but Doc reveals that he has no intention of letting them go for the hostages must be killed to secure their escape. Riccardo persuades Doc to let the little boy, who has been in a sedative-induced sleep for the whole duration, live. But Doc refuses and orders Riccardo to remove the little boy from the car. However, as Riccardo does so, he pulls out a gun hidden all this time in the child's blanket and shoots and kills both Doc and Blade, who fires off his machine gun fatally injuring Maria before expiring. With the tires of the car flat from the bullet hits, Riccardo moves the child to Doc's getaway car, and promptly steals the stolen money still clutched in Blade's fingers, and drives off.At a nearby rest stop, Riccardo, now alone, pulls over to make a telephone call. When a woman on the other end picks up, the film's big twist is when Riccardo says: ""It's me again. I have something important to tell you. Yes, it's about your son. Yes, he's right here with me. Now, if you ever want to see him again... alive... it will cost you 30 million lire."" Riccardo tells the sobbing boy's mother that he will call back to give her further instructions, and then hangs up. Riccardo casualty strolls back to his car, cheerily greeting a passing stranger on along the way. Upon opening the truck, the kidnapped child is shown, lying completely immobile as he has throughout the film. Riccardo gives the boy another shot of drugs to keep him sedated, closes the car truck, and drives away."

One dark evening, George dies after crashing the car and caravan while driving off a winding rural road outside the small town of Paris, while Arthur is relatively unharmed. Arthur feels guilty as he feels George would still be alive if he was driving. Although he was asleep right before the accident, Arthur remembers seeing a blinding bright light just before George drove off the road, the light which he is uncertain if real or his imagination.

Young Lucrezia,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071783/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the early-16th century, the mighty Borgia family, Cesare Borgia and his pitiless sister Lucrezia rule all Italy. Cesare, incestuously in love with his sister, commits a crime and starts a war campaign in Romagna. Lucrezia, meanwhile, gets pregnant. Cesare returns victorious from the war, and the Pope is then forced to separate his two children. In the late 15th century, Italy is boiling over with political intrigue amongst the many city states that comprise the region. The corrupt Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia is ensconced in Rome as Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503). While a cardinal, he fathered four children with Giovanna dei Cattanei, known as Vanozza: Juan; Cesare; Lucrezia; and Gioffre.Daughter Lucrezia has been married to Giovanni Sforza, Duke of Pesaro, for a year -- but he allegedly has not consummated the marriage. Her family wants the marriage annulled, on the grounds of Giovanni's impotence -- a political move designed to weaken House Sforza of Milan. Ludovigo 'il Moro' Sforza is furious, and gives his nephew a chance to demonstrate his virility in front of the Milanese court, where he predictably fails. He's obliged to sign the annulment for Cardinal Sisto Borgia, the Pope's brother, which frees up Lucrezia to be conveniently married off to the House of Aragon.Although Lucrezia is a willing player in family politics -- due in large part to her incestuous relationship with her father -- she's also coveted by her brothers Juan (the Duke of Candia) and the insanely jealous Cesare. Cesare discovers his brother's relationship with their sister, beats him to death in his private chambers, and blames his disappearance on House Sforza. His fathers spies, however, discover what really happened.Lucrezia is betrothed to the youthful Alfonso, Prince of Aragon, just as Cesare secretly prepares to attack Caterina Sforza in Romagna (central Italy), hoping to divert attention away from his recent fratricide. Before he leaves, Cesare hopes to bed his sister, and sends his trusted lieutenant, Pierotto, to carry his passionate letters to Lucrezia. She's amenable to her brother's offer, but she's more amenable to his messenger, who proves to be more virile than her unlucky husband, Giovanni. So virile, in fact, that she soon finds herself pregnant.As her marriage to Alfonso is about to take place, the hugely pregnant Lucrezia is presented to a shocked Papal Court. Lucrezia casually reveals that Pierotto is the father -- resulting in his immediate execution at the hands of an enraged Cesare.Despite her condition, the marriage to Alfonso proceeds as planned, and the besotted Alfonso can't get enough of Lucrezia's fecund charms. However, Cesare's jealousy will not be deterred by marriage -- neither his, nor hers. When she and her beloved Alfonso return from Spoleto to Rome, Cesare's hired thugs attack Alfonso, but fail to kill him -- so he finishes the job himself.Lucrezia finally resigns herself to her fate, and accepts her brother as her lover. In the director's final nod to historical accuracy, her father separates the siblings [marrying Lucrezia off to Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara; and Cesare to Princess Charlotte d'Albret in France]."

Freebie and the Bean,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071521/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"San Francisco police detectives Freebie and Bean are determined to bust local crime boss Red Meyers at any cost, even if this means destroying the whole city in the process. Freebie and Bean, two San Francisco police detectives, have one goal in life: to bring down Red Meyers, a local hijacking boss. After many fruitless months they finally collect an important piece of evidence. However, before they can get an arrest warrant, they hear the news of the hitman being hired to kill Meyers.—Dragan Antulov <dragan.antulov@altbbs.fido.hr> Freebie and Bean are somewhat bumbling odd couple partnered SFPD detectives with the Intelligence Squad. Despite their different natures, they have each other's back, especially when it comes to their so far fourteen month investigation against racketeer Red Meyers, who is well-connected in all the right places. They finally have the first shred of physical evidence against Meyers to corroborate the insider account of a lowlife named Harry Motley, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Despite the flimsy evidence and no Motley, they believe they have no choice but to bring in Meyers on any charge when they learn there is a contract hit out on Meyers, the hit man named Michigan Phil. Based on this information and recent knowledge that Motley is returning to town on Monday, the D.A., concerned primarily with maintaining his high successful prosecution rate and getting the highers-up off his back, recommends they release Meyers, but make sure he stays alive until Monday when they can bring both Meyers and Motley in. Their inconspicuous shadowing of Meyers in protecting him against Michigan Phil and any other potential attempts on his life is made all the more difficult as it is Super Bowl weekend, the game being held in San Francisco, and as especially Bean's thoughts steer toward the growing evidence that Bean's Latina wife is having an affair.—Huggo In nighttime San Francisco, California, two police detectives, Freebie (James Caan) and Bean (Alan Arkin), pick through the contents of Red Meyers' trash and find an incriminating receipt. When Freebie suggests they arrest Red Meyers, Bean says they must locate their witness, Motley, first. The detectives decide to seek out Whitey (Paul Koslo), who is rumored to be involved in a criminal venture with Motley.The next morning, on their way to a construction site where Whitey works, Freebie tells Bean they need to join the vice squad so they can make a lot of money and retire early, but Bean wants to become a lieutenant. Freebie accuses his partner of having low aspirations, blaming his heritage as a Mexican immigrant.At the construction site, Whitey denies any criminal activity but informs the detectives that Motley is out of town and will return Monday for a poker game.On the highway, Freebie and Bean answer a call over the police radio. Freebie drives recklessly as he exits the highway, and Bean puts on a helmet to protect himself. They join several police cars in a chase that ends when a stolen truck flips over, dumping a large supply of whiskey onto the street. Freebie and Bean notice the truck is affiliated with the construction company where Whitey works, and assume the driver is in cahoots with him and Motley. They later visit Whitey at his home, beat him, and threaten his girlfriend until he finally speaks up, saying they are wasting their time going after Meyers because a contract killer has been hired out of Detroit, Michigan, to murder him by Monday.Soon after, Freebie and Bean follow Meyers (Jack Kruschen) while he walks his dog and discuss their plan to apprehend him. Without Motley, they cannot detain Meyers for his actual crimes, so the detectives place him under arrest for ""indecent exposure,"" saying he unzipped his fly at the park. Meyers tries to pay them off, but Freebie and Bean take him into custody.At police headquarters, the District Attorney (Alex Rocco) reprimands the detectives for apprehending Meyers, a well-connected, albeit corrupt businessman, on such a ridiculous charge. Freebie and Bean explain that they have an ""airtight case"" against Meyers and urgently needed to arrest him. They hand over the ledger found in Meyers' garbage, but the District Attorney insists they produce a witness to corroborate their evidence. Freebie and Bean respond that their witness, Motley, will be available Monday. They also explain that an assassin has been hired to kill Meyers by Monday. The District Attorney instructs them to release Meyers and guard him against any hired killers until Motley returns.After Meyers' release, Freebie and Bean follow his car. At a clothing shop, they argue over the worth of pricey dress shirts while Meyers shops. Later, while staking out a barbershop where Meyers receives a haircut, the detectives spot a car with Michigan plates. Guessing the contract killer from Detroit is inside, Freebie calls for police backup. On the sidewalk, they approach the suspect and beat him up, only to discover the man is an unarmed Cadillac salesman.Back in the car, Freebie spots a suspicious driver and follows him while Bean reports the license plate number. They discover the license plate is stolen and continue to chase the car through the streets of San Francisco, running into a Super Bowl parade, which temporarily slows them down. Speeding along a highway ramp, Freebie loses control of the steering wheel and drives off the ramp. Miraculously, the car flies through the window of a nearby building and lands inside an apartment.That evening, Freebie and his girlfriend Barbara (Linda Marsh) enjoy a romantic dinner, but he changes the conversation when she suggests he move in.Later that night, the detectives stake out Meyers' home. When Bean falls asleep, Freebie steals his gun and wakes him up, pretending that assassins are outside. Bean rushes out but returns to the car when he cannot find his gun. Realizing that his partner pranked him, Bean chases Freebie into a nearby park. After a playful scuffle, he tells Freebie that he suspects his wife of cheating on him with a neighbor whose dogs dig holes in their front yard. Freebie offers to take Bean home, promising that nothing will happen to Meyers at his house, which is heavily guarded.At home, Bean lies on the couch while his wife Consuelo (Valerie Harper) reprimands him for creating a mess. Although it's 10:30 pm, she leaves, allegedly going to a parents' night at school.Later, Freebie and Bean go to a bowling alley in search of Michigan Phil (Robert Harris), a contract killer from Detroit. They spot Phil, and, as he goes to the bathroom, load their guns and follow him inside. The detectives shoot multiple bullets through Phil's stall door, killing him.Afterward, Freebie and Bean go to Motley's apartment where they find his former roommate taking a bath and claiming Motley is not there.Driving away, Freebie sees Bean's wife's car at a motel parking lot. The detectives pull in, put a 'no parking' sign in front of her spot, and call a tow truck to take the car.The following day, Freebie and Bean drive past a crime in progress as a Texas brawler beats people in the lobby of a hotel. Freebie and Bean arrest him, and, on the way to a nearby precinct, the man heckles them. Bean insists Freebie stop the car. Outside, he undoes the man's handcuffs and, pretending to fistfight him, uses a nightstick to beat him.Later, at a doctor's office, Freebie and Bean wait while Meyers undergoes dental work. Broder (Whitey Hughes), another patient, asks to see the dentist urgently and the receptionist allows him inside. Suspecting the man an assassin, Freebie follows him and fires shots. Broder reveals he is armed and crashes through the window onto a balcony. In the meantime, Freebie shoots another assassin, disguised as a dental hygienist. Freebie and Bean rush to a set of glass elevators and, boarding the elevator directly across from Broder's, shoot at him through the glass. Outside, Broder rides away in a van, and Freebie and Bean drive after him. After Broder's van collides with the detectives' car multiple times, rendering it useless, Freebie commandeers a motorcycle, driving it over cars stopped in traffic. Broder's van eventually flies off a bridge and crashes onto the street below. Freebie abandons the motorcycle atop the bridge and shoots at Broder from above, as Bean and other policemen arrive at the scene. Bean chases Broder's cohort into the kitchen of a restaurant and shoots him. Freebie appears, telling Bean that Broder got away.Bean returns home and interrogates his wife about her supposed affair, but she provides him with believable excuses for each bit of evidence brought against her.Later that day, a female blackmailer holds Meyers at gunpoint inside his car and demands $200,000. Freebie and Bean follow Meyers and the blackmailer to his office, believing the woman is Meyers' mistress. After she gets the money, the blackmailer requests to be dropped off by the football stadium where the Super Bowl is in progress. Meanwhile, Freebie and Bean get word that their witness, Motley, has been apprehended at the airport and they are free to arrest Meyers. The detectives stop Meyers' car, but the blackmailer panics as Bean approaches and shoots him. Freebie tends to Bean as he sinks to the ground, and the blackmailer runs away. Freebie gives chase, following her into a ladies' room inside the football stadium. There, he realizes the blackmailer is a transvestite, Motley's ex-roommate, whom he met earlier. The transvestite takes a child hostage and shoots Freebie in the arm. After the child breaks free, the men fight, and Freebie shoots and kills the transvestite.The District Attorney and Freebie's supervisor, Lieutenant Rosen, arrive at the stadium. They inform Freebie that Motley was killed on his way into town; therefore, the warrant for Meyers' arrest was canceled. Rosen convinces the District Attorney to let Freebie arrest Meyers without Motley. However, on his way to apprehend him, Freebie sees Meyers on a gurney, having died from a heart attack. The detective rides an elevator with the medic and Meyers' grieving wife, Mildred.At the ambulance, Mildred accosts Lieutenant Rosen, blaming him for her husband's death. Freebie looks on as it becomes apparent that Rosen was having an affair with Mildred. He confronts Rosen, who admits he coerced Mildred into throwing incriminating evidence into the trash, hoping Meyers would go to jail so he would be free to marry Mildred. Before the ambulance drives away, Freebie sees Bean on a gurney and assumes him dead. Upset, he rides in the back of the ambulance alongside his friend's body. Bean mutters from under a blanket that he wants a taco. Realizing Bean is still alive, Freebie yells at him, angry that he pranked him. The men tussle, causing the ambulance to crash."

A small town in the south-west of France, summer of 1944. Having failed to join the resistance, the 18 year old Lucien Lacombe, whose father is a prisoner in Germany and whose mother dates her employer, works for the German police. He then meets France Horn, the daughter of a rich jewish tailor.—Vincent Merlaud <merlaud@studi.mathematik.hu-berlin.de> 1944 in Nazi occupied France. Living in the largely rural southwest of the country, Lucien Lacombe is a restless young man who is easily distracted. He comes from a peasant farming family, his father who is currently a POW, while his mother, with the help of laborers, operates the farm. On his latest visit home, Lucien, who has no political or nationalistic inclinations, makes attempts to join the Resistance as he does not want to return to his nursing home job in the small nearby town. He is turned down largely because of his age. As such, he is easily co-opted to join the Gestapo instead when the opportunity arises by chance, even after he sees the brutality often exacted by his new colleagues, that brutality by which he is largely unaffected emotionally, even if it is against people he knows. He seems to be motivated by money to help his mother, and the other favors he can provide through the Nazis' position of power. His association with the Nazis is despite warnings from some that the end of the war is near, the Americans who will ultimately liberate France from the Germans. Lucien's life, and that of the others involved, becomes more complicated when he falls for France Horn, the daughter of local tailor, Albert Horn. The issue is that the Horns are Jewish. Lucien may have to make a decision between his allegiance to the Nazis versus his feelings for France. Conversely, the Horns have to decide how to deal with Lucien, whose association with the Nazis they naturally abhor, and who they may not be able to refuse or deny as he is the one wielding the gun, regardless of what they feel for him as an individual. France's actions may also be driven by her feelings of being Jewish, a peoples who seemingly are repressed on all sides.—Huggo"

They go on the hunt for a motorcycle riding killer. After an anonymous phone call, a teenage girl is found hanged in the attic of an old building in Lombardia and the police assume she committed suicide. The efficient Insp. Silvestri and the newcomer Asst. DA Vittoria Stori take on the case, and while checking the location, Insp. Silvestri sees a middle-aged man, Bruno Paglia, taking pictures of the place from a nearby building. The man is arrested and soon Insp. Silvestri learns that the 14-year-old victim, Silvia Polvesi, was part of a teenage prostitution ring which includes Insp. Valentini's beloved daughter. His further investigation with the Asst. DA Stori discover a tape where sexual encounters with important names in Italian society are recorded. Meanwhile, a black-clad motorcycle rider uses a cleaver to get rid of suspects and witnesses.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A group of police officers burst into a room where a nude female body is hanging from the ceiling. District Attorney Vittoria Stori arrives where she observes the scene to be that of a suicide, with the door bolted from the inside. The following day, Inspector Valentini gives Vittoria the autopsy report, saying that the girl, Sylvia, was 15 and had sexual relations before her death. Valentini talks to Sylvia's maid (her parents are in Africa), who says that Sylvia was being frightened by daily phone calls in which the caller was not responding. Vittoria watches footage of a demonstration and sees Sylvia walk into a building around the time of her death. Sylvia was found in another building, so Vittoria surmises that was murdered.Homicide Inspector Silvestri takes over the case. While visiting the crime scene, a man is spotted photographing from the room of a nearby building. The man, Mr. Paglia, is questioned; he has many pictures of Sylva having sex with a man, taken over a three week period. Silvestri talks to Marcello, the man from the photographs, and he has an alibi (he was been spelunking for days). Marcello tells the inspector that he was not Sylvia's first or only lover. Sylvia's parents return from their African trip and ID the body.The apartment where Sylvia was murdered is discovered; inside, there are photographs and a tape recorder, and the bathroom walls are covered in blood. Mr. Paglia is set free (the cops have nothing to charge him with). Silvestri tells reporters that they do not know if the blood in the bathroom is human.Sylvia's mother tells Vittoria that six months ago she found birth control pills in her daughter's coat pocket, and when she confronted Sylvia about it, her daughter was indifferent. The mother threatened to tell the father, and Sylvia threatened to cut her own throat with a straight razor. Sylvia's mother hired a detective, but he later dropped the case. Silvestri goes to see Sylvia's doctor, who says she was like any other girl her age. The detective's wife does not know where her husband is, and suggests asking his secretary Rosa (his ""latest lay""), in the clinic for a car accident. When the police find the detective's car, he is in the truck in many plastic wrapped pieces.Rosa, upset about her lover's demise, refuses to answer Silvestri's question (where the detective got the money to pay for her three operations); the inspector suggests blackmail. That night a cleaver-wielding person wearing black leather and a motorcycle helmet is outside the clinic. Rosa calls Silvestri and says she now wants to help. The person enters Rosa's room and tells her to say where her lover hid everything. Rosa screams, and the person runs out, followed by Silvestri and a fellow cop. The cop gets his hand chopped off when going for a light switch. Silvestri jumps into a car with Georgina. They chase the killer (on a motorbike), but the killer drives into an old train tunnel and gets away.Back at the clinic, Rosa shows the police the package in the vent, containing tapes. The recordings are of young men and sexual encounters with young schoolgirls, one may mentioning payment and in one instance a girl being raped. Vittoria plays some of the tapes for Sylva's mother and the maid, and they agree that it is the voice of Sylvia. The DA says there are six or seven different voices on the recording. Georgina looks for motorcycles with matching bike tracks, and learns of a butcher (who might have selected a butcher's cleaver as a weapon of choice), purchasing a bike six weeks ago. Later, the cop tells Silvestri and he talked to the butcher's father, and he said that the boy left three months ago and provided Georgina with a photograph.The next day, Silvestri passes by Valentin and his daughter Patricia; he stops when Patricia says ""good morning"" (recognizing her voice from the recordings). The inspector asks Valentine to his office, and Valentine is furious that his daughter is involved with the schoolgirl prostitution ring. Vittoria tries to show Silvestri a threatening note she received the previous night, but he tells her he gets those all the time. She rips up the note. When the DA is dropped off in a parking garage, she is attacked by the killer. She runs and hides behind cars until her driver returns for something she has forgotten. The driver is killed, and Vittoria runs to the elevator. The elevator stops on the third floor and the killer crashes through the door, but runs when someone calls out. The building superintendent clams Vittoria as the killer speeds away on his motorbike.The cops are looking for a butcher named Roberto whom is a suspect in the killings. Valentini has Patricia talk to Silvestri, but she can tell them only that a fellow student, named Julianna, told her about the prostitution. Julianna is picked up, and Silvestri asks her who Bruno is (she had said the name on the tape). She says she has only talked to him over the phone. The police learns that Bruno is the photographer, Mr. Paglia, but the killer has already paid him a visit and stabbed him in the stomach. Bruno dies in the ambulance.The following day, Silvestrai mis-informs reporters that he survived the attack and has told the police everything. Vittoria is angry about the inspector's fabrication, but he tells her that he is trying to weed out the killer and/or people responsible for the prostitution ring.After the story of Bruno's reputed incriminating confession, Sylvia's doctor is found dead in the bathtub from an apparent suicide. Vittoria talks to the quiet girl who attended the doctor's funeral, and she girl tells her of how, for her appointments, the doctor would drug her and do certain things to her. She says that once there was another girl there screaming, and another time a man did things to her. Silvestri returns with many files from the doctor's office, incriminating a number of men involved in the ring (the doctor was ""recruiting"" the girls). Two young girls telephone the police and says they saw the ""fellow on TV"" ride into a garage. The police surround the area. When the black-leather clad biker attempts to shoot his way out, he is gunned down and killed.Silvestri stops a superior and shows him all the files of people trying to bring down; the superior tells him that it would take too much time, and with the killer dead and his promotion, he should not care about the prostitution ring. Silvestri is upset, but Vittoria is there with him, and Valentini tears up his resignation."

Both trifles and structure are tossed out the door by director Ken Russell in this film. Here, historical content matters less than metaphors, feelings, emotions, and interpretations.

Included are his turbulent and dysfunctional family life as a child, his discovery of solace in the ""natural"" world, his brother's suicide, his (unwanted) conversion from Judaism to Catholicism, his rocky marriage, and the death of their young child.

Borsalino and Co.,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071241/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Marseille. Heaps of flowers and funeral wreaths... ""A man who no longer defends his colors is no longer a man."" It's the early 1930s. Working their way up the ladder largely on chutzpah, Roch Sifreddi and François Capella, who became best friends in their unlikely partnership, have risen to the top of the organized crime world in Marseilles. Shortly after reaching the top, Capella is murdered. Sifreddi eventually learns that the murder was orchestrated by international businessman Giovanni Volpone, new to Marseilles from Italy, whose ultimate goal is to take control of the city in all aspects--legal and illegal. While Sifreddi sees Volpone's action as the start of a gangland war, Volpone has other thoughts in sending a longer-lasting message to Sifreddi and others who may want to fill his shoes. Volpone has specific reasons for wanting Marseilles--a war he will want to wage in most of the western world to reach his end goal. Standing by Sifreddi in this war is Lola, a former prostitute friend to both Sifreddi and Capella, who was Capella's girlfriend at the time of his death, and Sifreddi and Capella's loyal and long-serving head henchman, Fernand. In this battle, Sifreddi can no longer rely on the hands-off approach by the police, former Commissioner Fanti, who would only intervene if the tit-for-tat killings got out of hand. Fanti has now been replaced by Commissioner Cazenave, who is a little out of his element in dealing with such matters. Under the circumstances, the police may have their own ideas of what they would like to happen with Sifreddi and Volpone's war, especially as Volpone views the law as only applying to poor people.—Huggo In Marseille, after the funeral of his best friend and partner François Capella, Roch Siffredi and his gangsters capture an Italian gangster that tells that the hit was ordered by the mobster Giovanni Volpone. They also learn that his brother is coming to Marseille by train. Siffredi and his men intercept the train and throw Volpone's brother on the rails. Soon Volpone kills Siffredi's men, destroys his businesses, throws his right-hand Fernand with a big stone into the sea and captures Siffredi that goes missing. He also uses his influence to replace Inspector Fanti by the corrupt Inspector Cazenave. Fernand survives and looks for Siffredi, who is interned in a hospice. Siffredi flees from the asylum with the support of Fernand and they escape to Italy by boat. Years go by until a truck of Borsalino and Co. travels to Marseille with Siffredi, Fernand and their new gang. Retribution is coming.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"

Introducing herself as Barbara (Suzy Kendall) and not really explaining how she got there, she quickly disappears as Christian is distracted. Despite seemingly being involved with the girl he's there with, Christian can't seem to get Barbara out of his mind. He finds a flask with the word, ""Tucania"" on it. Christian tracks it to a boat with the same name, harbored in a local marina. He and his girlfriend join a party aboard the boat, where they encounter Barbara and her current lover, Alex (Mario Erpichini).Christian abandons his girlfriend and leaves the party with Barbara, upsetting Alex. They drive through a wooded area, where they see lingerie-clad mannequins hanging. The couple winds up back at Barbara's motel.

After some flirtation, Barbara makes an odd request: Christian must shave his beard before the two have sex. He complies. As Christian shaves in the bathroom, he hears a noise outside. He pokes his head out the open window and is assaulted by a man with a gun. The man, Tatum (Adolfo Lastretti), enters the bathroom and threatens Christian.

Attempting to make it look like an accident, Tatum has him drive to the edge of the cliff and exits the car. Quickly turning the tables on Tatum, Christian reverses the car, smacking Tatum with the open door and running him over twice. Realizing that there is a conspiracy against him, he switches clothes with Tatum, puts his necklace around Tatum's neck, shoves the dead body in the car and pushes it off the cliff.Barbara and Luca (Franco Silva) arrive to make sure that ""Christian"" is dead. As they leave, Christian follows them back to his family's factory, currently being run by his brother Fritz.

He chokes Barbara to death and runs away.Fritz meanwhile has investigated the car crash and figures out that it's not Christian's body in the wreckage. Retreating to his mansion, he decides to indulge in some old family movies. As he's watching them, its revealed that Christian had mental problems as a child, and that his father's lunacy is hereditary. As he hears that, he begins to have flashbacks. It is revealed that Clorinda was the nurse at the psychiatric hospital and that Malcolm was the doctor. Additionally, its shown that he has killed Clorinda after the potential rape and dumped her in the well, that he killed the ex-girlfriend, the random woman in the car and Barbara.

The lady who's travelling with Charles, his wife Mikki Hughes (Mary Woronov) is the one who tells him to calm down and tells him to leave.Edmund is a writer who can't think of an ending to the story who's writing. He goes to the shore of the river and draws the dark drawing of a female face. A girl is swimming and the dog starts barking. Jason Blackstone (Timothy Ousey) goes after Aziz (Himself) the dog into the woods. Charles tries to chat up and touch Betsy (Lucy Bingham), the maid of the inn. Mikki tells Charlie to let Betsy be, as she's not his type. The girl goes inside after having rejected him and tells Nicole that she's going out with some friends of hers that very same afternoon, and Nicole, in spite of being stressed out, has to agree.Jason tells Dad that Aziz is alone on the woods. He tells him that Aziz will be back by itself, but Edmund tells his son to stay inside while he looks around. Charles will play catch with Jason, as though the boy were a dog himself.Nicole has dozed off in a bed while Edmund is out on the woods. She dreams of being tied up and of a mysterious masked woman with a torch threatening her. There are some knocks on the door, but nobody is there. Suddenly, an arm grabs her -- but it's only Jason with a mask. Meanwhile, Edmund is confused looking around the ominous forest. Suddenly, he notices that Aziz is hanging from a noose, dead. Mikki has a lover, and she talks to him while she is preparing himself for bed. He says he's got a surprise for her. That lover is Mark Frost. He says to Charlie that he's a disgusting person, but Charlie feels that he's got money, and that will be more than enough for Mikki. Mark tells him not to be a bad loser.At dinner, Charlie is behaving like a bully. Outside the window, Edmund sees the face of a man which scares him. Nicole gets worried - Jason is so worried for the loss of Isis, that he's got to be put into bed by his father.It's dark, already night. Betsy is going out, on foot, by herself. She hears like the growling of a wolf, and a man who appears out of the blue scaring her. She runs away, but the strong man, nicknamed Jackal (Henry Judd Baker) , dressed like an Indian or something like that, runs after her and catches her. Betsy says she'll do anything and the strong man touches her.Jason has noticed that his dad is afraid of something, and Edmund says that he's scared of something inside him. Nicole is tidying it all up for the night when she notices an open door. Peering outside, she can't see anybody and closes the door. She notices a shadow of somebody moving upstairs, but Charles appears to distract her from that. She checks on Jason, who's not on his bed. He's hugging himself on a corner of the room because he's afraid of his dad. Edmund is talking to Serge Kahn (Roger De Koven) as if he were on a psychologist's office. He tells of his dreams, running around the woods in panic, about his finding of the hanging Aziz, the face outside the window, the sketches he feels a compulsion to write. Serge listens - he's a wise old man who needs a walking stick to walk.Eunice Kahn (Anne Meacham) is looking at herself in the mirror, feeling old and sad. An incorporeal male voice tells her not to look back, and creates within her the illusion of being at a ball dancing with a handsome man. When the male voice tells her to look back, she sees a bearded man with a bone necklace and a shrill voice: he's The Spider (Hervé Villechaize). He plays a kind of ritual on her, kind of making her young again.Nicole has finally put Jason to sleep. Mark and Charles are playing chess. They hear something strange, and Charles sees Spider as well at the other side of a window. At that moment, the Queen (Martine Beswick) is attacking Mark and she strangles him. Spider breaks the window and enters holding a knife. Charles confront him as there is nobody else to do it: nor Nicole nor Mikki will do something about it. Spider is more athletic than him and he wins. Edmund kills Mark but can't kill Spider when he realises he's one of the people in his dreams. The strongman wins over Serge.The Queen will tell the rules and only one of them will be alive by the end of the night. Spider says that he, Queen and Jackal know all their secrets. They will have to run in a circle in a race: the last one will be executed. Gerald (Richard Cox), Nicole, Edmund, Serge and Eunice will run in that race. Serge gives a short speech about civilization: he realises he's the oldest and the weakest among them - in fact, he needs a walking stick.Spider shows Eunice her old scarred face. She is traumatized and keeps on dreaming about herself being beautiful and dancing. She kills herself by jumping from the window. Meanwhile, the race goes on, and Charles looks like he's about to have a heart attack. At the beginning, Mikki helps him, but then she goes on on her own.Edmund reaches their car and she pushes Nicole inside. The car won't start, so they are stuck there until Jackal appears to attack them. So they have no other option than to leave running.Meanwhile, at the home, Jason leaves his hiding place, He sees his parents arriving from the race. Charles was the last one: Jackal puts him at the Queen's foot as if he were a sack of potatoes. Charles tries to buy his life, but the three organizers will not have it. Charles defeats Spider, but Jackal finishes him off. The Queen tells Spider off, as he was defeated. Mikki smiles when Charles is killed, but then she tries to run away in her underwear - her long nightgown is clumsy to run. A car passes her by, honks at her but won't stop. Mikki arrives to a garage, but Spider is there.Edmund and Serge talk while they wait. The latter thinks that dreams are stereotypes, but that they do exist. Spider had read Edmund's letter. Spider takes Edmund to talk to the Queen. Jackal returns with Mikki. The Queen puts Edmund and Mikki to fight to death with knives. Edmund wins but doesn't want to kill her. The Queen is the one who finally does so. Spider walks around her dead body and says ""dead, at last"".Edmund asks the Queen about his wife. She kisses him, but he rejects her. She says that few men or women have ever rejected her, and that she'll give him two hours to be with his wife. He goes to the penthouse while she is rocking herself on a chair. Nicole hugs her son and tells him to run from the three dangerous characters in the morning. They hide him in a wooden casket and leave him there. Nicole says that their marriage is over: there was always some darkness inside Edmund. She realises that everything was in Edmund's dreams before, and he invited some friends to finish them off. Nicole has given up, but he tells Edmund to protect Jason no matter what. While they are hugging, there's an image of Jackal raping Betsy.When the dream finishes, two hours have gone by. Nicole is not with him: in the bathroom, she has cut her veins and written in the mirror I LOVED YOU. Edmund goes downstairs a broken man. Serge Kahn is still alive. Jackal is already dressed as an executioner. Serge tells Edmund not to feel any pity for him, as he's a bit tired and fed up with himself. He tears a cheque to pieces. Serge goes willingly under Jackal's axe.The Queen tells that there are only two people alive, Edmund and a child, but there can only be one survivor. Edmund denies that there's a child, but the Queen knows because he's told her before. If he tells where Jason is, he'll perfectly happy alive. She shows Edmund how she will kill Jason - but burning him to death in the fireplace. If Edmund betrays Jason - who's telepathically aware of what's being said - he'll begin his career and his life again. Edmund thinks that the Queen can't kill the innocent, so he tells where Jason is. He takes the three invaders to the attic, betraying Jason, but the child is not there. He thinks that Nicole used her hug to tell Jason to hide him somewhere else.Edmund runs away and falls downstairs. He kills Jackal with an axe. The Queen finds a hidden passage and there it's Jason. Spider goes after Edmund.A white specter appears: it's Nicole, who tells the Queen to take Edmund, but not her child. The specter tells Jason to go to his room. Annoyed, the Queen says that things being so, Edmund has to be her, to which the white specter only says: ""Take him!""Dawn is close. Spider catches up with Edmund and is about to kill him. At this moment, Edmund wakes up, all sweaty and distraught; he tells Nicole that he's had the same dream again - Nicole is supposed to be that bulk under the covers by his side.Edmund gets up and walks around his room. The sun is slowly rising. He thinks that it's over and that it was only a dream.He goes to shave, and suddenly he finds in the mirror the I LOVED YOU written by Nicole.

Sun Ra plays the piano, wearing glasses. The Overseer (Raymond Johnson), a black man in a white suit and hat, walks in with two women. The Overseer calls the manager over, telling him that the piano player ""sounds like sh*t,"" and to ""get him out of there, start the show.""The manager steps onto the stage, whispers something to Sun Ra and says, ""Let's hear it for the piano man, Sunny Ray!""

Sun Ra steps to the controls of the ship. The ship's monitor shows that they are approaching Earth. Then, the monitor shows the Overseer driving a red convertible car with a girl beside him.It's 1972.

He greets the youths, who stop what they are doing. The youths question Sun Ra, making jokes about his clothing.

He says that black people are myths, and he came from a dream the black man dreamt long ago. Sun Ra says he'll be here until he chooses which of them to take with him to outer space.

The Overseer tells the nurse to get a friend because they're going to party tonight.The Overseer tells Jimmy to get on the phone with Sun Ra. In his spaceship, Sun Ra picks up the phone. Jimmy asks him if they can meet in the ship. While Sun Ra talks, two agents monitor the call. Tania and a black nurse, Candy (Barbara Deloney), arrive in Jimmy's room, then take off most of their clothes. Jimmy says he's aroused by the nurses, and the Overseer makes him leave the room, getting into bed with them.At the outer space employment agency, a man walks into the door. Sun Ra sits inside the place. The man explains his credentials to Sun Ra, and says that he's afraid of his family getting forced onto the street or onto welfare. Sun Ra gives him a speech about work on outer planes. The man thanks him and leaves.A black guy steps into the agency and has a conversation with Sun Ra. The black guy says he needs a job. Sun Ra asks him, ""What have you been doing lately?"" The guy replies, ""Nothing, really, nothing."" Sun Ra asks, ""How long have you been doing nothing?"" The guy answers, ""Quite some time.""

Sun Ra explains his philosophies about black men's place in society and music, as well as the ""alter-destiny."" The two youths from earlier listen to them on the radio, and debate whether Sun Ra has ""sold out"" or not.The contentious game in the desert goes on. The Overseer's card shows two black guys playing pool in a hall and talking. A very fat guy sits behind them, watching them.The Overseer pulls his car to a stop with Jimmy Fey and two women in it. They all get out, entering a brothel. The establishment's madam, Bertha (La Shaa Stallings), greets them at the door. The Overseer says he has ""two big men coming."" The group goes to an upstairs bedroom, where the women start to strip. The Overseer says to Jimmy, ""Wait for me outside."" A frustrated Jimmy leaves, then curses and protests beside a group of hookers.Two white men step to the brothel's door and are greeted by Bertha. She tells the women who came in with Jimmy and the Overseer that the men are aerospace technicians from NASA, and to have sex with them. The prostitutes start to party with the NASA technicians, but as it turns out, the men cannot perform sexually. One prostitute refers to the men as ""punks."" The Overseer and Jimmy barge in, spurring the NASA men to leave.The NASA men reenter the room where there are now three prostitutes and no Overseer or Jimmy; one of the men slaps two of the women around. Bertha steps in. The NASA men say their goodbyes to her, calling her a ""n*gger,"" and they leave.The name Sun Ra is displayed outside a concert hall. Two agents look at the display, taking pictures of it. Inside the hall, Sun Ra works on some music. One guy says to another that Sun Ra has been working for four days and nights straight, asking when he'll take a break. Sun Ra says, ""forces have been set in motion, forces that none of us can control.""Back in the brothel, the Overseer, Jimmy and Bertha tend to the bloodied women.In the desert, the card game continues.In the hall, Sun Ra's buddy tells him to go home and get some rest, and that he'll pick him up in time for the concert. Sun Ra leaves. The two black youths from earlier see as Sun Ra is captured and loaded into a van that is driven away. They hotwire a car, then get into it, eager to rescue Sun Ra. To their surprise, the fat guy from the pool hall appears in the back of the car.These three guys drive to the rescue, as people sit in the hall waiting for the concert. The agents interrogate a tied-up Sun Ra about his powers, such as ""transmolecularization."" Sun Ra doesn't talk, so they put headphones on his ears playing corny music. The agents leave him there while they go get something to eat.The three youths find the agents' van and open a garage door next to it. They race up some stairs, kick down a door and find Sun Ra. They untie him. The eating agents see the three guys drive off with Sun Ra and run back to their van, pursuing them in it.The Overseer and Jimmy Fey talk backstage at the hall. The Overseer remarks that there's no Sun Ra, and tells Fey to send the audience home. The hall is crowded. Fey attempts to entertain the crowd at a microphone and the discontent audience chants, ""We want Ra!"" repeatedly. Fey introduces Sun Ra, who has made it to the place. Sun Ra takes a seat onstage behind some keyboards. The Overseer stands back, waiting for what he calls Sun Ra's ""concession."" Sun Ra and the Arkestra perform some electronic music, with him and June Tyson doing some chanting together.The two agents from earlier step backstage, one of them holding a handgun. He points it at Sun Ra. The two youths who rescued Sun Ra see this. They run across the stage, and one of them leaps between the agent and Sun Ra. The agent fires his gun, accidentally shooting the youth. The surprised Overseer walks away. The fat guy grabs the shooter and pulls him to the floor. The other agent points his gun at Sun Ra, who makes the wounded youth and his friend disappear, only to show up in Sun Ra's spaceship. The youth who was shot is somehow unhurt and blows bubblegum. Sun Ra magically transports the fat guy to the ship, then he disappears himself.The Overseer returns to the brothel, saying, ""There's no way he can beat me this time."" He greets two seated prostitutes, one of them bandaged due to her beating from the NASA man. She vanishes, then the other one does too, both of them appearing in Sun Ra's ship.At the pool hall, the two guys from an earlier scene see the door mysteriously open. They stop playing pool, then one of them drops his dope-shooting tools onto a table and steps outside through a crowd gathered around Sun Ra's ship. This guy tells Sun Ra that he did drugs because he felt he didn't fit in anywhere. Sun Ra lets him onto the ship. Jimmy is also allowed onto the ship, but Sun Ra says that he will take Jimmy's ""black part"" with him, allowing Fey to go without it. In the brothel, the Overseer calls for Jimmy, who appears in front of him, his speech sounding more stereotypically ""white."" Another bandaged hooker sits beside the Overseer. Jimmy escorts her out of the brothel. The Overseer yells, ""RA, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" and storms outside.Sun Ra, surrounded by his entourage, says farewell to Earth, gets onto his spaceship, and it takes off. On the ship's monitor, we see the Overseer's car pull up to where the ship was. The Overseer angrily throws his hat down. Scenes of apocalypse can be seen on the ship's monitor.As the ship gets away from the Earth, the planet explodes."

A million miles away from 'Camelot' or 'Excalibur', this film ruthlessly strips the Arthurian legend down to its barest essentials.

He tells the others to keep their armor on, stay in training, perfect themselves.Some knights discuss this and say they despise Mordred. The queen's window is lit in the night. Lancelot meets Guinever again in the barn. Still she will not release him from his vow. She thinks she is his strength. Then she looks up at him, back down. Then he looks up at her, back down. Then she looks up at him, back down. Then he looks up at her, back down.The knights are getting restless, you can tell because they are all standing facing right, having a chat together.

He tries to hide himself, but his friends find him and insist he carries on helping them. The political prisoner Fulvio Imbriani is released ill from prison and the authorities expect to find his rebel friends though him.

The soldiers kill a great number of revolutionaries but Fulvio escapes with Charlotte that was shot on the back. She dies and Fulvio travels with his comrades but without enthusiasm. Sooner he betrays the group, trying to flee to United States with the money of the revolutionaries and his new lover Francesca.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Against the backdrop of the Bourbon Restoration, Lombard aristocrat Fulvio Imbriani, a former political extremist who once served under Napoleon, is finally released from an Austrian jail, after a lengthy sentence for his part in the secret Sublime Brotherhood. He strives to resume normal family life, but his Hungarian lover, Charlotte, together with his ex-comrades, succeeds in convincing him to take part in a revolutionary cause in the south. In fact, Fulvio considers the effort futile and fails to stop his sister Esther from reporting the conspirators. But the trap fails to catch the intended prey and, evading arrest, the comrades meet and bury Charlotte, who was killed in an exchange of fire with the gendarmerie. Fulvio is still with them, despite repeated attempts to get out of what he was sure would be a fiasco. On arriving south, Fulvio goes ahead to scout the land where he betrays his red shirted comrades to a priest who tells the authorities. However Fulvio is tricked by the sole survivor of the party that the revolt has succeeded. He puts on his discarded red shirt to be killed alongside his comrades, massacred by the soldiers and peasants. The year is 1816. Napoléon Bonaparte has fallen, and as the last pockets of revolutionaries and fervent members of the secret sect of the Sublime Brotherhood struggle to resist a horrible fate, the Bourbon Restoration begins. However, one of them who was fiercely persecuted by the police for his beliefs--the noble Lombard aristocrat, Fulvio Imbriani--will eventually find refuge in the ancestral mansion, after twenty long years of dedication to the cause. Now, as Fulvio timidly rediscovers the joys of freedom, he dares to dream of starting a family and a new life away from bloodshed; but, does his homecoming mark the end of a political commitment that nearly obliterated all his personal aspirations?—Nick Riganas"

There, they learn that a nuclear holocaust is taking place and that they've been ""chosen"" by computer to survive in the shelter in order to continue the human race. The shelter is designed to allow the people to exist underground comfortably for years, but they are faced with a threat nobody could have predicted: a colony of thousands of bloodthirsty vampire bats finds a way into the shelter and launches a series of vicious attacks where they claim the humans one by one.—acidxian A helicopter transports a group of ten people to a
remote desert location. Dazed and seemingly drugged,
they are forced through an intimidating line of
soldiers and crowded into an elevator, which takes
them over a mile into the ground. They find
themselves inside a futuristic facility with walls of
stainless steel, surrounded by computers and large
screen monitors. The monitors come to life and they
are addressed by a pre-recorded video clip of a woman.The woman identifies herself as Mary Louise Borden
(Kelly Lange). She informs them that the world is now
engaged in a nuclear holocaust; war has broken out and
bombs are destroying the Earth as they know it. They
have been selected by computer to be transported to
the facility, which has been specially designed by the
government to house a small group of human beings for
five years. The monitors display what appears to be
images of the world being destroyed by seismic
catastrophes. Rivers of molten lava flow in an area
that the display identifies as San Francisco. The
entire Northern hemisphere appears to be on fire. Before signing off, Borden tells them that there are
other groups of people in similar shelters throughout
the United States and the world. These people will
join them once the Earth is safe for habitation again,
and they will begin civilization again together.The group is in shock over what has happened, and they
immediately start establishing their personalities. Steven Mayes (Alex Cord) is a philosophical author and
artist, and tries to see the possibilities in
recreating the human race. Raymond Couzins (Jackie
Cooper) is a wealthy businessman who is used to
getting his way; he is suspicious of the reasons for
their arrival at the shelter, and does not accept that
the world has been destroyed. He also mistrusts Major
Gordon Ellis (Richard Jaeckel), who the group discovers also living in the shelter. Ellis is a soldier who was part of a team assigned as custodians to the facility, and it was just blind luck that the emergency happened on his watch.Mishaps begin right away, including a power failure
that plunges the facility into darkness, then blue
emergency lighting. The next day, the group finds the
occupants of a large bird cage entirely wiped out,
each bird lying in a bloody pool. During another
power outage, one of the women in the facility is
terrified when something brushes past her in the dark.
When the lights come back on, they see what it was: a
bat, clinging to a wall. They capture the bat and
apparently kill it, studying the dead animal. They
identify it as a vampire bat, and deduce that bats
must have been responsible for wiping out the bird
cage.That night, as they sleep, the power goes out again,
and bats enter the private room of Kristen (Christina Moreno). She
suddenly awakens, surrounded by bats climbing over her
sheets and fluttering around her in the air. Her
screams attract the others, and they ward off the
animals, pulling her to safety. Now established that the bats will attack human beings, the group guesses that the nuclear destruction on the surface has decimated the natural food source of the bats, driving them into the shelter to search for food.Christina is in shock from the attack, compounded with the shock of the nuclear holocaust, and she begins to unravel mentally. Peter Macomber (Bradford Dillman) takes notes on the group, documenting their behavior, and Couzins becomes more paranoid about why he is recording the information. Couzins clashes with Ellis and accuses him of being responsible for the group's forced incarceration in the shelter, but Ellis strongly denies it. Ellis sets up an alarm system to signal the group if the lights should fail again.Couzins gets drunk and rages at everybody in the facility, alienating himself from the rest of the group. While they think he is sleeping off his binge, he sneaks into the computer control room and starts flipping switches, causing another power failure. The darkness brings the bats and results in the death of Luis (Pedro Armendáriz Jr.), who gets cornered in one of the hallways. The bats swarm over him and slash his flesh, mutilating him.After Luis's death, the group converges in the main chamber and Macomber makes a startling annoucement. He says he will have them all out of the shelter within 45 minutes; the entire setup has been a hoax. While they really are in a bomb shelter over a mile below the surface of the Earth, there is no nuclear holocaust, it has simply been an experiment conducted by the government to see if such a scenario would actually work. Everybody is outraged, especially since Macomber allowed the experiment to continue even after the threat of the bats was realized. Macomber claims that he wasn't sure if the bats were part of the experiment or not, until Luis was killed.Macomber sends a signal to the surface, but the damage that Couzins did in the control room prevents contact with the outside world. They are truly cut off, and unable to summon the elevator that would take them to the surface. Macomber informs them that with no contact, it will be five more days before the military checks on them. Kristen is so despondent over the circumstances that she attempts suicide, swallowing a bottle of barbituates. The others find her and rescue her by pumping her stomach, and she remains in the infirmary.The group tries to ward off any further bat attacks and wait out the five days, but Couzins is restless. He approaches Woody Russo (Lincoln Kilpatrick), an olympic athlete, to climb the elevator shaft and manually activate the elevator. Couzins promises Russo $100,000 to make the dangerous climb, but Macomber proposes another solution: electrocute the bats.The group rigs a series of metal screens, which are then coated with blood drawn from each person in the complex. The screens are electrified and they put out the lights, luring the bats in. The plan seems to work, with hundreds of bats electrocuted. However, once the lights come back on, they discover that the infirmary has been invaded by bats as well, and Kristen is now dead. They now understand that there are more bats than they could ever hope to kill, and Couzins repeats his offer to Woody, who agrees to climb the elevator shaft.Woody's dangerous climb goes well until he nears the top of the shaft; a small crack in the elevator wall reveals the cave of the bats, who are agitated by the light on Woody's helmet. They begin to swarm and seek out the entrance to the shaft. Woody stuffs his jacket into the crack to hold them off, racing to reach the top of the shaft and escape, but the bats push their way through. Woody manages to open the doorway of the elevator shaft, letting in light from the outside, but bats on his face cause him to lose his balance and he falls back down the mile-long shaft, his body landing on the roof of the elevator. The light at the top of the tunnel drives the bats back down into the complex, where they swarm through the opening and attack the rest of the human beings.Couzins, Mayes, Ellis, and a few others manage to take cover, but the others are overcome in one of the main chambers. Macomber goes back to help them and he, too, is killed. Outside, a helicopter arrives, summoned by Woody's signal, and the elevator is activated. Soldiers remove the survivors from the shelter and they return to the surface, dazed from their harrowing experience."

Caucasian teacher Pat Conroy was born and raised in Beaufort, South Carolina. In March 1969 under the Beaufort School District, he starts a job teaching at a small poor school located on Daufuskie Island, an island in a South Carolina river delta, the island accessible only by boat. The island is inhabited exclusively by blacks. He quickly learns that his students, who have never left the island, lack not only a basic understanding of academic items such as the alphabet and simple arithmetic, but also of other basic necessities of life such as personal hygiene. They can't even pronounce his name, they who call him Conrack. The teachers before him, including the school principal Mrs. Scott, have always treated the students as being slow and basically unteachable of academics. Conrack, a free thinking man, decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects, but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy, and some of the fun things in life like classical music, art, baseball, movies, swimming (despite living on an island, the islanders live in fear of the river because they don't know how to swim), and Halloween. He does so with compassion and without being patronizing. His teaching methods come under question by both Mrs. Scott and the Beaufort School District administration led by its superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. These differences in viewpoint may place Conrack's tenure at the school in jeopardy.—John Trumbull A young, Caucasian teacher is assigned to an isolated island off the coast of South Carolina populated mostly by poor black families.

Thomasine & Bushrod,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072278/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The exploits of 1910s bounty hunter Thomasine and bandit Bushrod who, after rekindling their old romance, take to robbing banks to survive, stealing from rich whites and sharing their loot with the poor on the harsh frontier. Blaxploitation's answer toBonnie and Clyde (1967)follows the exploits of early-20th-century bounty hunter Thomasine (Vonetta McGee) and bandit Bushrod (Max Julien) who, after they rekindle their old romance, take to robbing banks in order to survive, stealing from rich whites and sharing their loot with the poor living on the harsh frontier. Combining rollicking action with a subversive anticapitalist punch, this Black western is a prime showcase for McGee's formidable talents. Set in New Mexico during the years 1912-1915, a fictional black ""Bonnie and Clyde""-type race through the Southwest in their ancient jalopies, shooting lawmen and sharing the riches with poor blacks, whites, and Native Americans alike. One avenging sheriff, determined to bring the pair in, pursues them relentlessly. Thomasine and Bushrod are bank robbers who operate in the American South between 1911 and 1915. In 1911, Thomasine is thrown in jail after she knocks out and robs a man who attempted to force himself on her sexually without paying her for prostitution. After the sheriff lets her go, she notices a wanted poster of her former boyfriend Bushrod and tracks him down under the guise of being a bounty hunter, only to reunite with him and resume their relationship. After he kills a notorious bank robber nicknamed ""Adolph the Butcher"", Bushrod is convinced by Thomasine to rob banks under her leadership. While Bushrod gives stolen money to African Americans, Mexicans, Native Americans and poor whites, Thomasine just wants to survive.—Anonymous In 1911 Texas, Thomasine, an African-American woman, takes a break from working at a small-town laundry store and tells one of the washerwomen that she was orphaned as a newborn baby. A man named Dodson appears and molests Thomasine as if she is a prostitute. After leading Dodson into a nearby barn, Thomasine holds him at gunpoint. Revealing herself as a bounty hunter, Thomasine turns the man in to Bogardie, the town marshal. In Bogardie's office, Thomasine notices a wanted poster for H. P. Bushrod, an African American fugitive. The marshal says he personally wants Bushrod, dead or alive, and the reward is $1,000. At a ranch, Bushrod breaks a horse, then strikes a white handler for mistreating the animal. Afterward, an elderly man named Nathaniel approaches Bushrod and treats him like a celebrity, saying he has heard stories about Bushrod ever since the fugitive was a child running with the circus. Bushrod asks Nathaniel if he knows where to find Adolph ""The Butcher"" Smith. Meanwhile, holding up a bank with his gang, Adolph Smith kills two men with a sharp spear. Outside a place called The Last Town, Bushrod sees two African-American children hanged to death beside a sign that reads, ""If you look like these two - go around The Last Town."" Bushrod angrily rips the sign down and cuts down the boys' corpses. That night, Thomasine waits outside a boarding house and saloon in The Last Town where Bushrod is playing cards. After a spat with a card player who makes racist comments, Bushrod retreats to his room upstairs. There, Thomasine surprises him with her gun drawn, but the two greet each other like old friends. Thomasine confesses that a boyfriend of hers will arrive on a stagecoach the next day and warns Bushrod that Bogardie is looking for him. Bushrod admits to publicly humiliating Bogardie, suggesting that the man has a personal vendetta against him. Thomasine shows Bushrod a bunch of wanted posters that she has stolen, and they kiss. In the morning, Adolph and his henchmen appear outside the saloon; however, before they walk into a bank, Bushrod stops them. Adolph and Bushrod fight, and as Bushrod shoots him multiple times, Adolph says nothing will bring back Bushrod's sister and he is glad he killed her. As Adolph dies, several police arrive. The sheriff tells Bushrod to drop his gun, but Bushrod says Adolph is a wanted man. Bogardie appears and tells the sheriff that Bushrod is also a wanted man, although Bushrod claims he is no longer a fugitive. A shot fired from a distance causes everyone to scatter, and Thomasine shows up on horseback, helping Bushrod escape. Later, Bushrod tells Thomasine that he can make two or three dollars per day by breaking horses, but Thomasine says she wants enough money for a house and land. Bushrod agrees to do whatever it takes to make her happy. In another small town, Thomasine spots a wanted poster for Bushrod that states he was last seen with an ""unidentified colored girl."" Annoyed, she crumples up the poster and suggests to Bushrod that they take a photograph together. Inside a photography studio, Thomasine insists she stand on the left side. While waiting for the photograph to develop, Thomasine ogles an automobile parked outside. The owner, Mr. Tyler, introduces himself, saying he owns the whole town. Bushrod expresses interest in establishing a bank account, so Tyler leads the two on a tour of the bank, which they immediately rob. Forcing Tyler to accompany them, Bushrod and Thomasine steal his automobile and flee. That afternoon, Tyler attacks Thomasine from the backseat, and Bushrod fights back. Thomasine shoots Tyler dead. Remorseful, she cries and argues with Bushrod, who says the only reason he puts up with her bossiness is because he knows how hard it must have been for her to survive on her own. Thomasine becomes irate when Bushrod accuses her of acting like a man, but they soon kiss and make up. Back at the photography studio, Bogardie studies the photograph of Thomasine and Bushrod, and the photographer guesses that Thomasine wanted to be on the left side so that her name would appear first on the wanted poster. Thomasine and Bushrod gain notoriety as they rob several more banks, often wearing fancy new clothes. They make frequent visits to a small village, delivering money and supplies to poor Mexican and African American farmers. One morning, Thomasine reads to Bushrod from a newspaper article that identifies them as folk heroes. They laugh at the article's inaccuracies, but later argue as they camp in a forest and Thomasine struggles to cook a rabbit. She reprimands Bushrod for giving away all their money, reiterating her desire to own a home. Going into the village alone, Thomasine is caught by bounty hunters. Bushrod gets word that she is being held at the church, and helps her escape by disguising himself as a nun. Bogardie catches up to the fugitives on the road, but misses them when he fires several shots, allowing the couple to escape once again. Traveling at night, Bushrod and Thomasine happen upon Pecolia, a blind Native American woman. Pecolia and her companion, Seldon, inform Bushrod that his mother was a Comanche, and Pecolia cryptically warns Bushrod that he does not have much time. The next day, a general store clerk realizes Thomasine and Bushrod are bank robbers and strikes Bushrod. However, as the clerk draws his rifle, a Jamaican man named Jomo appears and shoots him. Bushrod embraces Jomo, an old friend, and leads him back to the abandoned house where he and Thomasine are hiding out. Bogardie questions the clerk Jomo shot, learning that Jomo has joined the couple. Jomo drives Thomasine and Bushrod's stolen car into town, angering Bushrod, who fears that someone might follow him.

When Molly leads Ikey, a farmhand, inside to vote, Gid teases Johnny and suggests that he date Sarah Peters. After Johnny leaves, Gid takes a walk with Molly, kisses her, and asks whose girl she is. Molly thinks she is too silly for Gid, commenting that Johnny is silly but only Eddie White (Conard Fowkes), another boyfriend, is as silly as she. After Gid compliments her beauty, she suggests that maybe she is Gid's girl and they embrace. Ikey rides past on his mule and Gid suspects Johnny paid the farmhand to spy. Gid complains that he and Molly must keep their relationship secret.One day, Johnny and Gid work on a farm together, and Gid presents Johnny with a new saddle. Gid's father, Mr. Frye (Ed Binns), forces Gid to plow a field despite his protests. He tells his father he wants to go to the Texas Panhandle with Johnny to find work.Sometime later, Gid visits Molly at her house and asks her to go fishing. Molly says she received a postcard from Johnny, but Gid doesn't care to see it. Kissing Molly in a field, Gid suggests they get married. Resisting the idea, Molly tells Gid she will do anything but marry him. Molly undresses and runs into a pond, but Gid stays behind and she accuses him of being too careful.One evening, Gid visits Sarah Peters (Susan Sarandon), who tends to several illegitimate children inside her home before joining him for a walk. They kiss, and Sarah mentions marriage, but Gid does not respond. At her home, Molly shows Gid her black eye, explaining that her father, Mr. Taylor (Claude Traverse), hit her, but only because she provoked him. Gid apologizes for not swimming with Molly and says he loves her. As she undresses him, he walks away to latch the front door. Upset that he left the room, Molly yells at Gid not to leave her again. Waking up in her bed the next morning, Gid asks Molly why there is no blood on the sheets, and she casually confesses she was not a virgin.Heading to a livestock market, Gid and Johnny ride a train. Gid wants to know if Johnny plans to propose to Molly, conceding that, because Johnny made love to her first, he should have the first chance to marry her. Johnny says he thought Molly lost her virginity to Gid, and the men realize that Eddie must have slept with her first. Gid claims he will marry Molly despite being her third lover.Back in town, Gid asks Molly to accompany him to a dance but she has promised to go with Eddie. At the dance, Johnny fights Eddie, and the sheriff intervenes. Johnny and Gid work on a ranch outside town, but Gid becomes homesick and returns, finding his father ill but unwilling to go to the doctor.One night at Molly's house, Eddie crosses paths with Gid upon his arrival and informs him that Mr. Taylor accidentally drank lye and died. After Eddie leaves, Molly rushes outside to vomit. That night, Gid lies in bed with Molly and comforts her. Johnny sends word to Gid from the ranch, promising to visit Molly soon.

Mr. Frye consoles his son, asserting that a woman's affections are random and he shouldn't sulk. Gid later finds a suicide note from his father and realizes he has gone to shoot himself.At Mr. Frye's funeral, Molly asks Gid to visit her soon. Sarah approaches after Molly leaves, and Gid takes her hand. Sometime later, he and Sarah marry.

When he comments that their son may be tougher after the war, she cries, aware that Matt hates her for being an adulterer. Molly recalls that her alcoholic father instructed her to marry Eddie because, though he didn't have any money, he drank and would treat her like a wife should be treated. After she was married, everyone in town became aware of her affair with Gid. In town, Molly receives a telegram that Matt has died. Gid drives by, offers her a ride, and takes her home where they mourn in silence.That night, Gid announces to Molly that he cannot see her romantically anymore, though hes still madly in love with her. Molly wants to continue to sleep with him, believing he and Sarah no longer have sex. She asks if Gid is ashamed of her, like Matt was. Gid responds that he is ashamed of them both. Molly wonders why she does not feel shame and says she believes that love justifies adultery. Gid demands to know why she wouldn't marry him years ago. Molly admits she thought Eddie needed her more, but she was wrong. Gid agrees to come by when he can risk it, but Molly angrily sends him away. Molly reads the letter she received from Matt before his death, in which Matt reacts to the news of his brothers death and says he hopes he is killed as well. He writes that he will never forgive her for sleeping with Gid out of wedlock, and promises she will not hear from him again. Molly burns the letter, saying she knew it would break Gid's heart and cause him to stick by her.Sometime later, Molly asks Johnny if he disapproves of her. Johnny says he is not the type of person to be ashamed and assures her they raised a good son. Molly wishes that Gid felt the same way. One day, Gid delivers a puppy to Molly. Afterward, she says she badly wanted to touch him, seeing that he needed it, but did not want to tempt him.In 1964, the voice-over narrative shifts again, this time to Johnny's point of view, as he visits a terminally sick Gid in the hospital and presents him with a prank toy that shoots a fake snake out of a can. Teasing his friend, Gid pretends to have a heart attack. Johnny helps him break out of the hospital early, and Gid asks to go to Molly's house. Two days later, Gid leaves to go back to the hospital despite Molly's attempts to make him stay. While working on a windmill, Gid tells Johnny he might leave Sarah to live with Molly for the remainder of his life, believing it will give him peace. Johnny agrees that it would be good for both of them. Moments later, Gid falls off a ladder on the side of the windmill. As Johnny drives him to the hospital, Gid dies from his wounds.Later, Johnny consoles Molly at her house. When she sees that he is sexually aroused, she tells Johnny not to feel ashamed and they make love. The next day, Johnny asks Molly how she would feel about getting married. She turns him down but says he is welcome in her home every night. Johnny recalls that, in his will, Gid left Johnny one thousand acres and a pickup truck; however, he only left Sarah a pocket watch. Johnny remembers the day when he and Molly kissed outside the schoolhouse and confesses that he sent Ikey to spy on her and Gid."

Things only get worse when Saroj moves in to live with Surya - compelling him to make a final decision about a visibly pregnant Laxmi.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Surya, the son of a wealthy landowner, returns home from the city after graduating from school and is expected by his father to get married and take over a piece of land. He settles in not without conflict with the other people from the village, whose traditions he does not share. He uses his position to begin a love affair with Laxmi, who is unhappily married to a deaf-mute drunk. When Laxmi is left by her husband, Surya invites her to live at his house, much to the disdain of everybody else, who see this as a breach of the caste system. Their love affair ends abruptly when Surya's wife arrives. Rather than keeping to his promises, Surya drives Laxmi out of the house; when it turns out that she is pregnant, she suddenly becomes a threat that must be disposed of. The final scene of this movie raised many eyebrows upon its release in 1973, as it was seen as a disquieting symbol of rebellion against the country's social structures. Shabana Azmi's compelling performance as Laxmi laid the foundation for her becoming one of the great actresses of the independent Indian cinema of the 1970s and 80s.—H. Prillinger"

Prell gives them a presenation on the Yeti, displaying slides with representations of what the unknown beast might look like based on descriptions of supposed eyewitnesses. Prell is planning an expedition with the four graduate students to Boot Island, where his associate Dr. Karl Werner (Tawm Ellis) lives. Werner has told Prell that he suspects a yeti lurks in the woods around his estate, and Prell intends to capture evidence proving the creature's existence. Prell seems particularly interested in Keith, and takes him to dinner at an exclusive restaurant, where he orders a meal for them that isn't on the menu, a special dish called ""gin sung"".The other students go to a party where they meet a former student of Prell's, Spencer Ste. Clair (Tom Grail). Spencer starts drinking, much to the objection of his wife (Luci Brandt), and when he overhears the students talking about the expedition with Prell, Spencer causes a scene at the party. He becomes hysterical, recounting his own experience on one of Prell's expeditions 8 years prior. Spencer and Prell were the only ones to survive, the others presumably killed by the yeti, which Spencer says attacked him and left him for dead. The people at the party don't take Spencer's story seriously, and he and his wife leave. When they return to their apartment, Spencer's wife breaks his bottle of liquor, causing Spencer to attack her with an electric carving knife. He cuts her throat and then gets into the bathtub, fully clothed, drinking beer. Before she dies, Spencer's wife drags herself into the bathroom with a toaster, which she plugs in and tosses into the bathtub, electrocuting Spencer.Prell and the four students travel by van to Werner's estate, a six hour journey. When they arrive, they meet Werner and his servant, Laughing Crow (Ivan Agar). Werner claims to have had a near encounter with the beast, which he says he hears howling in the woods around the house. He says he smelled a foul odor and heard a very loud heartbeat when the yeti was near. Laughing Crow frightens Karen when she discovers him chopping wood for a fire, and Karen seems particularly sensitive to the potential danger they may encounter. After Prell shows them a map of the island, they plan a route and retire for the evening. That night, Karen hears a strange snarling sound off in the distance.The next day they set out for their destination, some caves where Prell hypothesizes that the yeti may be using for a lair. Before they reach it, they stop to rest and Tom goes off on his own with a rifle, claiming to have seen deer nearby. Prell tells the others he will go ahead to the caves to see if he can see any sign of the yeti. Tom finds a dilapidated barn, where the yeti suddenly appears, leaping onto him and slashing him to death with its claws. When Tom does not return, the others search for him but return to the house at dark.The next morning, the search party resumes but Lynn oversleeps and the others leave without her. During the search, Karen finds Tom's bloody severed leg. Just as they are returning to the house, Lynn decides to explore the greenhouse, but when she goes inside she screams and goes running back out, dashing off into the woods where the yeti follows and kills her. The others find her body and bring it back, storing it in the greenhouse.Prell devises a plan to use Tom's severed leg as bait for the Yeti. Karen is horrified, but Keith still trusts Prell and they go ahead as planned. Prell claims to have been attacked by the Yeti before he could obtain any photos or evidence of it, and they decide to use Lynn's body as bait this time. Karen refuses and keeps telling Keith she wants to leave, but Keith is furious that she does not want to follow Prell's plan. Later she goes into the greenhouse and attempts to move Lynn's body so they can't use her as bait, but instead she finds Tom's body in there. She passes out.When she comes to, she's in bed and the others tell her she simply dreamed finding Tom's body. Eventually she relents and agrees to help get photos of the Yeti using Lynn as bait, but she insists if it doesn't work they all must leave. Prell agrees. The plan almost works, but the Yeti rushes them and nearly grabs Karen. While she is taken back to the house, Keith and Prell rush into the woods after the Yeti. Keith is mystified when he discovers audio speakers wired into the trees, broadcasting the ominous heartbeat of the Yeti. Back at the house, Laughing Crow is playing the heartbeat into the loudspeaker system. Someone knocks Keith unconscious. When he comes to, he goes into the house with a shotgun and confronts Prell and Werner, but Laughing Crow knocks him unconscious again using a large bone. While Werner is distracted making a phone call, Keith comes to again and steals the van, knocking Prell unconscious in the driveway. He drives to the bridge, detouring to hide the van when he notices an oncoming procession of vehicles, apparently headed to Werner's estate.Karen is recovering from the shock of the Yeti attack in her room when she hears the sound it makes outside. When she looks out the window, she sees it running across the grounds toward her window, and it starts to climb right into the room. Panicked, Karen runs through the house with the Yeti after her, growing more and more terrified. Finally she hides in a bathroom and locks the door, but she can't escape. She discovers Laughing Crow inside one of the cabinets, wearing strange face paint and clothing. He emerges with a knife and approaches her threateningly, until Karen lies down on the floor and suffers a heart attack. The Yeti carries her body downstairs and removes its own costume, revealing Werner inside. Prell and Werner congratulate each other on the job they did obtaining their latest ""sacrifice"".Keith returns to the house with a policeman he managed to flag down, but the cop turns on him and reveals himself to be an ally of Prell and Werner. A diverse group of people have gathered at the estate for this event, which Prell encourages Keith to be a part of. They are a cult of cannibals who come from all walks of life, each of them hosting this festival year after year. The last time Prell hosted was the incident with Spencer Ste. Clair; Prell hoped to induct him into the group, but he ""didn't work out"", and they left him alive to carry the legend of the Yeti back with him, which allows the cannibals the means to collect victims unnoticed. Prell has the same hopes for Keith, who has already tasted and enjoyed the special ""gin sung"" dish made of human flesh. At first Keith is resistant, but he is faced with the difficult choice of either being killed by the group or eating Karen's body, and the last shot of the film is Keith drooling over the idea."

The Castle of Sand,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202604/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Detectives investigate the murder of an old man found in a Tokyo rail yard. Two concurrent stories that eventually do intersect are told. The primary story concerns a murder investigation of a bludgeoned John Doe, estimated to be in his early- to mid-sixties, the body discovered at the Kamata Rail Yard in Tokyo and moved there post-mortem to make it look like he died by being hit by a train. The investigative team includes experienced Inspector Eitaro Imanishi and novice Detective Hiroshi Yoshimura. The slim leads they have in even discovering the identity of the John Doe, let alone the murderer, stem from an overheard conversation at a local bar between the victim and the perpetrator, the men unknown to anyone in the bar, the keys to the conversation being one speaking in an accent specific to the Tohoku region, and both men often mentioning the proper name ""Kameda"". In the ebbs and flows of the investigation, and Yoshimura being taken off the case in a lull to focus on other more active cases, both investigators nonetheless end up with a dogged determination which takes mostly Imanishi to various places throughout Japan in following leads, some on his own dime in being unofficial. The investigation only becomes more confusing in discovering the identity of the victim, what the investigators are told by those that knew him being his general benevolence in all aspects of his life, and that he had no business in Tokyo. The secondary story concerns renowned up and coming composer/conductor Eiryo Waga, his fame which means that he is often surrounded by an entourage. His general sullenness may be attributed to a childhood denied, that denial of which he is the only person who knows, or so he believes.—Huggo"
Policewomen,1974,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072006/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A lady cop infiltrates an all-female criminal gang. Lacy Bond (Sondra Currie) is escorting B.J. Anderson into prison. The Police Sergeant (Loretta Swit) at the reception desk, admonishes her for not having signed the form triplicate, and Lacy looks bored. Lacy and Anderson follow a guard to a cell, Lacy opens the handcuffs of Anderson and the guard opens the door. Suddenly, they are shoved aside by the inmates, who run away through the corridor. Anderson and the guard are knocked out when they hit their heads on the wall and the floor, respectively. Lacy is shaken but not out, and she runs after the fugitives. The one she cache sup with, she grabs her hair from behind, and kicks her rump, sending her head first onto the wall. In quick succession, she stakes on those who were running behind her: the second with a clothes-line with her left arm; the third with a knee to the groin; the fourth with a kick to the stomach; the fifth with a karate chop; the sixth with another low kick.The first three fugitives manage to pass a door, and black Pam (Jeannie Bell- first black Playboy centerfold) produces a small pistol to menace a prison guard, demanding she opens another door. and she takes it with her two companions. Meanwhile, the Warden and a few cops, guns in hand, stay behind the closed door.Lacy Bond is knocking out the rest of the fugitives: the seventh with a high kick to the face, the eighth with a chop, the ninth with a punch. The tenth runaway, a redhead with a ponytail, opts to run back into the cell, closing the door behind her.The three fugitives tie up and gag the prison guard, strip their uniforms and change clothes - that had been hidden in a laundry car, together with a long rope, grenades and explosives - and do not pay attention to the Warden's demands to surrender. Pam imposes herself to her companion Janette (Laurie Rose), a shoulder length brunette - because she is the one with the gun - and then they throw grenades and teargas into the corridor, forcing the Warden and cops to run away, or fall on their rumps, coughing. The three fugitives, now in black leotards, boots, and breathing masks, reach easily the door to the roof, explode the last barred window with a piece of dynamite, and descend to the street via the long piece of rope.Although delayed by the smoke in the corridor, Lacy also gets to the roof, just in time to catch the last of the three fugitives, a blonde, whom she knocks out in a brief karate fight.(Film credits)The morning after, Lacy Bond reports to Inspector Martell (Chuck Daniel), a black man, who has reviewed her CV and found that she may be a troublemaker, having placed - and been denied - 26 requests to be transferred from prison guard to field officer. She does not see that is a problem, simply wishing to experience what ""gutsy"" men experience on the street - she says it pointedly, as the deputy inspector with Martell had been addressing her with macho superiority, and could lose some weight. He introduces her to lieutenant Frank Mitchell (Tony Young) who tells her that there is a dangerous mission that only a woman may perform, and to sergeant Pete Petersen (Richard Schuyler).The inspector decides to give her that mission, but first she will have to go through the entrance course, ""to show what she is capable of"". Lacy Bond fires an automatic rifle, placing all shots at the head of the target; at the driving area, she drives a police car back and forth at speed, much impressing the Driving Instructor (Marland Proctor), and then, in a karate outfit, she is taken to the gymnasium, where Bill McClarsky, the black belt Karate Instructor (William Smith), who has an advantage of 1 foot in height and 80 lbs in weight on her, promises her to go easy on her, and then does the opposite. The sergeant is happy at last, Lacy is not, and tells it to the instructor. When they face up again, the little woman's bare foot impacts firmly into his groin. He staggers aside but turns round, and attacks again. The blonde then flips, tosses, chops, and lays to rest the haughty Goliath in less than 30 seconds, the last time with a kick to the face that cuts his lip and breaks one of his front teeth. Lacy apologizes several time, with a smile that betrays her words. (The karate scene is cut from some copies.) She is taken to the police lab, where a technician shows her micro transmitters hidden in a lady's mirror and a cigarette lighter. In between tests, she had been told that there is a crime wave, involving prostitution, bank robberies, gold smuggling - and the inspector suspects they are all planned by a well organized female Mafia.A car parks in front of a closed gate to a large mansion, driven by Frank Mitchell, with Lacy and Petersen inside. Petersen goes to have a word with another team of cops, in a red car in front of them, and then he calls out Mitchell to join him. Lacy is about to object, them being talking in front of the house like that - but then a Woman in Black Sedan (Angela Carnon) arrives; she is about to park close to the gate, but seeing the two men talking to the red car's driver, and Lacy on the other car, she speeds away instead. Lacy takes the wheel, and gives chase, leaving her superiors planked on the road. The woman is forced to slow down because the road is narrow, and a slow driver is in front of her, and then she loses the control of the car when she was trying to surpass but a van comes in the opposite direction after a bend. The black sedan falls into a ravine, a fire starts, and the driver dies in the subsequent explosion.The fire brigade is ending their work on the burned out sedan, which had been carrying a lot of heroin in the trunk, and inspector Martell is not pleased, but sergeant Petersen takes the opportunity to blame Lacy of blowing their cover. Lacy starts an argument, and says they shouldn't have been talking with the other cops, so distracted that they hadn't seen the black sedan. Frank Mitchell confesses that they had been discussing lunch, inspector Martell ends up accepting Lacy's view of the matter, and she makes peace with sergeant Pete, the old fashioned cop.While they are at this, a blue sedan enters the mansion's gate. It's a large property, with an asphalt road lined up with trees and shrubs, several cars parked close to the house and a lawn and playing field. The Womn in the Blue Sedan opens the trunk of her car, and from it come the two prison fugitives: Pam and Janette. The brunette goes to Maud Anderson (Elizabeth Stuart), who is busy with an automatic calculator and a stash of bank notes on a camping table.Maud is happy to see Janette again, and they talk about the escape, then the 70+ old lady asks rudely, ""Who's the black?""
""She's Pam Grier [sic], she had a gun - came in handy!"" answers Janette.
Maud says she doesn't like guns, and wants to know how the girl had gotten it. Pam extracts the gun from her waist, and throws it on the table. ""It's fake, I made it!"" Then she tells she was in for prostitution. Maud is not satisfied with all she has to say.Kim (Eileen Saki), in white sweater and baggy trousers, detaches herself from the other girls who're playing on the lawn, and interrupts the meeting, with racist obscenities and saying that ""we don't want black bitches around here"". Without losing her composure, Pam, still in black sweater and dark blue figure hugging trousers, tells Kim ""But Honey, I doesn't understand your attitude, I always say nice things about gooks..."" hinting at the obvious Asian ancestry of the other girl. On the background, Doc (Phil Hoover) is lifting weights, wearing only white shorts that emphasize the bulge in his crotch. Kim rams headfirst onto Pam, who falls overturning a light chair. Kim kicks Pam before she is able to stand, and a circle of cheering girls surrounds them quickly, including Maude and her lover Doc. Pam makes Kim fall, but on the ground she is then victim of a back-breaker and arm lock combination. Kim then jumps upon the supine Pam, but Pam throws her aside.Pam tries to stand, but Kim is fast, and karate kicks her three times in a row, making the black girl fall on her back every time. At last, Pam manages to escape another attack, and receives a diving Kim with a double kick to the chest. They keep karate kicking each other for a little while, until Pam knocks Kim out. Then, Pam hurls Kim up three times, and three times she knees her to the jaw and face, achieving her completely. She drags the bloody faced, unconscious girl to the table, picks up a large water bottle, and is about to smash it on her head, when Maud shouts, ""That's enough!""Maud is pleased with Pam, and offers her money and what she may want if she obeys her commands. Pam looks at Doc, again lifting weights and sporting an erection. Maud says angrily that Doc is her husband, and all girls know they can not approach him. Pam says she did not want a piece of him.Then she shows Janette and Pam where they will live, and they're interrupted by Doc who brings bad news, that Susan is dead, and it seems the police had already been surveying the house before she delivered the drugs. Doc is unhappy about Maud trusting so much the stupid girls, she calls him a moron, and gives orders to pack their things and prepare to abandon the house.Indeed, the police has set a video camera on the front of the house, and are keeping watch. Over lunch, inspector Martell decides to send Frank and Lacy to Catalina Island, to look for clues there of Maud's operation. Meanwhile, Maud is telling Doc that losing three boats with gold is not a problem to her, because 62 boats got through the authorities' net. She tells Doc to stop his weight lifting exercise, as the weights are making metallic noises that distract her from her accounting. Reluctantly, he does, and approaches her suggesting that he will be taking a shower - his grin suggesting sex. She says, ""Not today, Doc. I've got a headache and a sire throat."" He goes to the showers, followed shortly after by Laura (Susie Ewing), a long haired brunette in a blue bikini. She strips nude, and enters the shower cabin, suggesting she could soap him, and Doc could soap her. The girl makes up to him, but he is too worried with Maud to accept, and leaves. She calls him ""Fag!""Janette is trimming Pam's large Afro hairdo, leaving her with a totally different look.On Catalina Island, Inspector Mitchell and Lacy Bond have got a yacht in location from the Hobie Cat club, they rent a buggy to go to Las Casitas, they bicycle through the scenic spot, drive a motorboat, walk around the port and buy shrimps and chips from a street stall, ride horses in the wood, smooch each other at a restaurant, walk some more eating hamburgers, sail in a light catamaran, and refresh themselves at the hotel's swimming pool (he inside, she out), before taking their shorts and bikini off, and dressing for a romantic dinner at the restaurant. Frank is wearing a tie, and Lucy a a low cut decollete golden dress. Over a cup of wine, their conversation goes from gender relations to sex, and she promises to be gentle with him, and not repeat what he described as ""dangeous moves"", evoking her test at the police gym. Follows sweet sex in bed, and finally he asks why she had learned karate - she had started at 10, and was a black belt at 17 - and why she wanted so bad to do field work - she had wanted to be a policewoman and her first assignment was as prison guard, a job where she felt imprisoned.Next morning, they are early sunbathing aboard the yacht, at the dock.Frank Mitchell and Lacy Bond are spying the gang's movement from a yacht at the docks. Frank suddenly exclaims, ""Caroline Field"", and Lacy doesn't understand, because she is face down, wishing him to put more suntan oil on her back. Frank's eyes are open wide, as he just identified the blonde in the white bikini going aboard a large yacht, the Westerly, close to theirs. Lacy is suddenly alert. He tells her that that girl had been a high class call-girl, with a gangster boyfriend. Frank decides to follow Westerly that is just leaving the port. The Westerly was about to get in contact with the smugglers, but Caroline and her girls noticed the presence of the small yacht, got suspicious, and decided to return to the port. When passing close, Caroline recognizes Frank as a cop she had known. Caroline decides to take the wheel, and crash the small boat. With Lacy at the wheel, the small yacht manages to evade the attack of the big yacht. When the two boats are very close again, Frank manages to jump aboard the Westerly, and he punches a couple of girls, but he is outnumbered and ultimately knocked out and beaten by the other three with a paddle and a metal chain. He is bloodied, and knocked out.Lacy, dressed in gray trousers and an open jacket over a top that leaves her midriff bare, manages to jump onto the large yacht, after stopping her own. She high kicks Laura in pink bikini and yielding the metal chain, who falls onto her back KO'ed, either from the kick, or hurting her breasts on the yacht's handrail.A Hit-girl in a striped skirt and matching bra is next, yielding a club; she attacks and goes down with a knee to the chest and a karate chop to the head.Kennedy, a brunette in a red bikini, was still beating up on the fallen man, so she turns around to aim it at Lacy. But the policewoman deviates the hit, and floors the attacker with a right punch to the head.Caroline Field (Dorrie Thomson), the blonde in a white bikini, was also hitting at Frank with a paddle, and comes at Lacy next. This is a longer fight, until the blonde loses her weapon, and is KO'ed by Lacy's powerful high kicks.Using the micro radio she had been given by Inspector Martell, she requires police support and reports five arrests - the four girls she has knocked down, and a Hit-girl brunette in a pink sweater and shorts, that had been knocked out by Frank when he first boarded the big boat.After delivering the hit-girls to the police, and against Frank Mitchell's opinion, Inspector Martell decides Lacy should continue her infiltration mission, assuming that Maud's people in Catalina Island do not know her. Frank goes to hospital, physically hurt - and with his male ego also hurt, despite Lacy going sweet on him.Raymond Willis (Wes Bishop), waiting in vain for Maud's girls, decides to call her about the situation. She is mad at him, and says he is responsible if that shipment is lost - he should take care of the problem, or else. Maud decides to leave the house immediately, and her orders are followed. On Pete Peterson's watch, all of them leave the mansion in fourteen cars and vans of different descriptions, that Pete reports - uselessly, and missing just the last car - to the cops that only have one car available to follow the suspects, who are driving in two opposite directions. Maud is in a blue Volkswagen driven by her husband, with Janette and Pam on the back sit.""You just learned one lesson, girls. No one gives a shit about a Volkswagen.""Soon, the four of them are flying a hydroplane, to have a meeting with Raymond, at the Catalina Attendant's home. Maud is worried of losing this large cargo of gold.Meanwhile, the Westerly comes to port, driven by Lacy, who reports to the Catalina Attendant (Lee Frost) that she had found it without crew on board. He tells her that it belongs to Richard Willis.Lacy goes to Richard's villa, situated in a viewpoint over the ocean, and when she says she has brought his yacht back, he welcomes her in - only to subject her to some hard slapping by Doc's hands, in order to know where the female crew is. She keeps saying she doesn't know and takes a severe beating. When both Maud and Doc think she is unconscious, they talk about the gold cargo, and Maud's plan to leave the island. Janette and Pam are returning from a stroll outside, and Janette recognizes Lacy, from somewhere. Pam intervenes, saying she also remembers her - from being in prison with her, in Chicago, and presents herself as Pam Harris. Lacy does recognizes both as fugitives from the Bakersfield prison, but jeeps her mouth shut, and goes along with Pam's story, who tells Maud that ""This girl is OK. She's one of us""Maud goes to the boat ""to see if he finds something"", but returns home empty handed, and bored by the presence of some dozen cackling, beautiful girls that now surround Maud.Pam takes Lacy and Janette out to a restaurant, where Janette - who's wearing a blonde wig. Janette keeps talking about past love affairs, but slowly she brings in the subject of imprisonment, policewomen, and of a particular police woman who had broken her nose. She ends saying pointedly that she hates policewomen. Then she tells Pam that Lacy is a cop. Lacy tries to say that she's confusing her with someone else, but Janette insists that ""She is the woman who put my fingers on that paper!"" Then, seeing how Pam keeps silent, she takes the conclusion that, since Pam said Lacy was a con, she must be in collusion with the cop. ""So, that's it! You're both cops!""Janette stands up and leaves the restaurant in a hurry, and so do Pam and Lacy. Pam says to Lacy, ""We must get her."" Lacy is delayed by the restaurant manager, who wants her to pay the bill.Pam overcomes Janette on the run on a plateau overlooking a cliff. She tackles her, is punched to the face, but grabs her leg, stopping her to continue to Richard's house. They fight, Janette finds a handy piece of wood with what she clubs at Pam's breasts. Pam stands up and they fight again with kicks and a throw - that sends Janette off the border of the cliff. Pam tries to give her a hand to pull her up, but the girl is either too heavy or to scared to help, and then the brunette opens her hand and with a piercing scream, she falls into the ravine to her death.Lacey arrives out of breath, and asks Pam what happened. ""I couldn't save her.""
""You're cop, aren't you?""
""Secret Service.""
Pam concocts a story for Janette's disappearance, that she had had to kill the dark blonde as she found out that she had been informing the police about the gang's deliveries. Both women trade information about the case.Aboard the Westerly, Pam and Lacy watch how Maud receives the gold - via an inflatable boat that pops up (from somewhere) at a certain latitude-longitude point. After tying the boat to the yacht, Maud maneuvers the yacht to the main coast, instead of Catalina Island, which surprises the policewomen that had been told they would be back to the island, and where both Police and Secret Service personnel was waiting for Lacy and Pam' signal to act.Doc plunges into the sea and single-handed, pulls the inflatable boat to the coast, to where Maud has already carried her dozen girls with no visible paddling boat on sight.Each girl carries two bars of gold, and the large container on top of the inflatable boat is thus emptied. The girls carry the gold to three army trucks stationed at the beach along with a military police car. Maud tells them that there are military uniforms for the girls to wear. ""And no one ever stops an army convoy!"" she says. The girls do as ordered, and Lacy activates her ""lighter"", sending a signal to her colleagues. However, the signal interferes with the walkie-talkie Doc is using to communicate with another girl elsewhere, and that leads him to discover the culprit object in Lacey's uniform pocket. ""What's this, girl? I've not scene you smoking before!""Lacey runs away, followed by Doc, who's followed by Pam. The other girls stay put, not understanding what's going on. He knocks out both women with a punch each. Maud shoots a warning shot and tells him to stop. Her priority is getting the convoy on the road quick, and ""we'll drop these two on the way"".Both policewomen are put inside a truck, with Doc and Maud - with her gun - guarding them.
""You two girls, did a really bad mistake... No cop ever screwed around with me and got away with it!"" says Maud.
""She's no cop,"" interposes Lacy, pointing at Pam with her jaw - though their hands are not tied.
Maud is not impressed, and tells Doc they are to be thrown off the top of the cliff as soon as the trucks are there. When she gives the signal, Doc asks who will be the first, and Lacey volunteers.
She and Doc stand up - and Lacey starts a fight with him, while Pam KO's Maud with a punch, and takes her revolver, watching Lacey fight the big bodybuilder alone. He goes down, his face bloodied and his groin hurt with a knee blow, much like that Karate Instructor early on.
Pam tells her colleague, ""She's had it,"" referring to Maud.
Then they lift the tarpaulin between the cargo area and the cabin of the truck, and Lacey knocks out the woman driver with a precise karate chop to the neck. Pam takes the wheel and, with an acrobatic move, both girls get into the cabin before the truck goes off the road.Then, Lacey manages to jump onto the next truck - without being seen by the driver or her assistant. This time, she performs the karate chop with both left and right hands, with such precision that both the women driver and her assistant are KO'ed at once. And alone, she wriggles into the cabin to take the driving wheel, and go on driving despite the cumbersome sleeping women in the cabin.
After signaling Pam that all is OK, Lacey speeds up and overtakes the first truck in the convoy, who is driven by Kim.
The woman driver of the police car does not understand what's up, but she doesn't allow Lacey to overtake her, and engages in a ""test of strength"" which has the expected result of her car being driven off the road, into the ravine. Lacey stops and goes to border of the ravine to see that no survivors are left.Pam keeps watch with Maud's gun, over three girls in uniform, but Kim was quick in understanding something went wrong, and ran away - followed by Lacey.
""Ran scared, honey?"" teases the redhead policewoman.
Kim turns around smiling, then attacks with a loud shout. Again a karate fight takes place, this time with no one to see Kim biting the dust, and fall onto her back, KO'ed by a kick to the plexus.Inspector Martell and Frank Mitchell are there to arrest the survivor's of the gang, and take the cache of gold. Frank invites Lacey to go an another dangerous assignment with him, which she promptly accepts. He is in such a hurry to be alone with her that he ""abducts"" her in a police car.
Doc and Maud are in custody of the police, in a police car, and she's making plans for a diamonds' heist, already."

The Runners are apparently successful in wiping out crime and lawlessness - using all manner of traps and tricks to round the criminals up. However, their main target is the notorious Richard ""Big Dick"" Turpin (Sid James), a highwayman who has evaded capture and succeeded in even robbing Sir Roger and his prim wife (Margaret Nolan) of their money and clothing.
After this humiliation, Turpin becomes the Bow Street Runners' most wanted man, and thus Captain Fancey is assigned to go undercover and catch the famous Dick Turpin and bring him to justice.The Bow Street Runners nearly succeed in apprehending Turpin and his two partners in crime, Harriet (Barbara Windsor) and Tom (Peter Butterworth), one evening as they hold up a coach carrying faux-French show woman Madame Desiree (Joan Sims), and her unladylike daughters, ""The Birds of Paradise.""

Helen comes out, sees Paul's body, and screams. Seeing the car keys gone, she runs into the woods until she stumbles upon Odis Pickett, a hillbilly carrying a rifle. Helen tells him she needs to call the police. Insinuating more than hospitality, Odis suggests that she follow him back to his house and rest while he calls the sheriff. Inside the Pickett farm house, he introduces Helen to Emmy Pickett, his young, pregnant wife, and Sarah Pickett, his daughter by his first wife. The two women tell Helen they do not have a telephone. Moments later, Odis' simple-minded son, Bo Pickett, arrives. When Helen gets angry at Odis for luring her to his cabin, he tells her she needs a good night's sleep and then he will walk her to the sheriff's office in the morning. Helen decides to leave, instead, but as she stands on the porch looking into the dark woods that surround the house, Odis warns her that her husband's killer might be out there waiting for her. Also, the only neighbors are Tom Watkins and his boys a few miles away, and they are generally ""liquored up"" after dark and have no women around. Helen decides to wait until morning.

When Odis knocks Sarah down, she warns him she will castrate him if he touches Helen. Emmy tells Bo to go to the Watkins place and call the sheriff, and despite his fear of the woods at night, he succumbs to Emmy's urging. On the trail, the mysterious figure murders Bo on a spike fence. Discovering that Bo is gone, Odis becomes enraged and gets another jar of liquor.

When Odis tells Sarah to clean the body for tomorrow's burial in the back yard, Sarah says that Helen should clean him up, because she brought trouble by coming to the house. Sarah tells Odis that Helen is a witch who will get them all killed unless they kill her first. Inebriated, Odis goes to rape Helen, and Emmy fends him off by offering herself, even though she's very pregnant, but Odis threatens to kick her in the belly if she gets in his way. He chases his wife out of the room, turns out the light, and rapes Helen. In the morning, when Helen wakes up, she slips on her clothes and starts to sneak away, but Odis grabs her. When Sarah reminds Odis that Helen killed Bo, Emmy distracts him by saying they need to get the preacher before they can bury him. Odis sends Sarah to the Watkins house to call the preacher. On the trail through the woods, Sarah hears someone behind her and calls out that she is on his side and can help him get Helen. A figure approaches, and Sarah seductively invites him to consummate their new relationship, but he strangles her with barbed wire. Later, Emmy worries that Sarah has been gone a long time and suggests that Odis look for her. Odis tells her that if Helen is gone when he gets back, he will whip her with a branch. Still, after Odis leaves, Emmy tells Helen how to get to the lake. Helen wants Emmy to go with her, but Emmy says Odis needs her now more than ever. Meanwhile, Odis finds Sarah, barely alive, but when he loads his shotgun, a figure grabs it from behind and kills him. The figure goes to the house, knocks, and walks in.

As such, in the night of November 26-27, 1940, the Death Teams executed forty political prisoners in the Jilava prison (in the movie, named ""Viraga""), and next day, other two Teams arrested and shot the former minister Virgil Madgearu and the world famous historian Nicolae Iorga (in the movie: Costin Märgeanu and Nicolae Jugu). To squash down the political outcry, the Police Prefect Stefan Zävoianu (Visan Nävodeanu) conveniently assigns the cases to a commissioner from the ""Morals Division"" (prostitution, thieves), Tudor Moldovan, hoping that he will fail to get to the bottom of the case. However, Moldovan has communist sympathies, so he quickly comes under the influence of the Bolshevik Pîrvu, who had escaped during the Viraga massacre, only to be later apprehended again by the police. Pîrvu being an old friend and work mate of Moldovan's father, he feeds to the commissioner all the well-known soviet propaganda, during the interrogatories. Thus gained on the left side, Moldovan turns against the Iron Guards, in a short time gathering enough evidence to close the case. Hearing about this, the Iron Guard Senator Naumescu (Nae Ionescu) tries to bribe Moldovan - but the commissioner only accepts the money (one briefcase containing half a million lei, worth his salary for ten years) to use it for financing the communist party. He then delivers the file to the ""Universul"" newspaper, but the Legionnaire commissioner Paraipan, his arch enemy, retrieves it before going into print. Learning this, Naumescu orders Moldovan's dispatching. After a long and noisy series of shootouts and street action, Moldovan gradually shoots eight out of the new members of Paraipan's team, sparing only Tänäsescu, who had been assigned as his assistant during the investigation. Loyal to the cause, Tänäsescu informs Naumescu about Moldovan's whereabouts - so the Senator lays a trap for the commissioner, using Tänäsescu as bait. At the height of an unequal confrontation, in the heart of the Plumbuita slum, Moldovan is ridden with bullets by a few dozens of Legionnaires.—Mihnea Columbeanu"

A voiceover narrator warns the viewer that the film we are about to watch contains scenes of stomach-churning gore. The visual reveals an average looking man going into a theater and sitting down. Corresponding with the narration, he pulls out a handkerchief and gags into it. The narrator explains that this shot, along with a buzzing warning sound, will be inserted into the film before all the gore scenes, and that it is intended to allow the viewer to look away in time if they have a weak stomach. The film then begins after the credits, which are superimposed over images of a graveyard.In a funeral home called The Happy Halo, we see Bill, a mortician, at work preparing a freshly delivered corpse for viewing. The funeral director asks Bill is he will stay late to work on an ""emergency"" case that's being delivered that evening, the deceased victim of what seems to be a bear attack. Bill agrees. The funeral director, who is more than a little bit creepy, stumbles through the graveyard, gets into his hearse, and drives around for a long time, speaking to himself in a voiceover narrative. Intercut with this are scenes of Bill slicing into the corpse he's working on. For some reason, the funeral director returns and helps Bill put the finishing touch on the corpse: cotton balls to make the cheeks seem more full.From here, we see two young couples taking a day trip in a power boat. After boating to an island, where they swim and make out on blankets, they decide what to do next. Having grown tired of the local rock concert scene, Richie and his girlfriend Julie want to spend the night in a graveyard. Alan agrees, but his girlfriend Lisa, Richie's sister, isn't into the idea.

All around the vault, corpses begin to rise out of the graves, and they descend on the group. Pushing their way into the vault, the zombies kill Julie and seriously injure Richie. Alan and Lisa manage to escape with the wounded Richie, while the ghouls devour Julie. Lisa and Alan take Richie to a hospital, where doctors perform surgery on him, but they are unable to save his life. A doctor tells them that Richie is dead, and Lisa passes out in shock. They put Lisa to bed in an empty room and give her a sedative to help her sleep, while the doctor questions Alan about what happened to them.It is here that we realize that the corpse Bill was preparing for, the ""bear attack"" victim, was Richie. He is delivered to the funeral home, while Lisa has a disturbing dream in the hospital. She dreams that she is standing over Richie's coffin in the funeral parlor, where he awakens and kisses her on the mouth, leaving a great amount of blood behind. Lisa screams and imagines that she wakes up in the hospital room, where she bites open Alan's throat and stabs a nurse to death. Alas, this is only a nightmare, and Lisa awakens for real.Meanwhile, at the funeral home, the director gets drunk in his office and falls asleep at his desk. Later, he is awakened by an anonymous phone call. For some reason this prompts him to investigate the funeral parlor, where he finds zombies feeding on the corpses.

This is not something that even Yeung's daughter Ah Jen accepts and she thinks Ku Ding's action (or lack of action) was foolish and it doesn't help with his money problems.

Amarjeet, the family friend of Anands, is the producer, so he could get the dates of Dev Saab and Zeenat Aman. In 1974, if you had already signed Dev Anand and Zeenat Aman , the financiers bee-lined to back the project.With the funds available in abundance, Amarjeet could hire Bindu, Anand Baxi, and Laxmi Kant Pyare Lal. It was quite common in late sixties and early seventies to sign highly sale-able stars and begin the shooting- and develop the plot as you go along. BR Ishara was chosen as the director. In my opinion, BR Ishara was a very good director but in the early seventies , his name was associated mainly with the adult movies. I could not see his films like Jaroorat, and Chetna because I was a minor then. So I only saw these movies when they came to the theaters for the second time. While Jaroorat is run of the mill stuff, Chetna is an excellent film with hardly any nudity in it. Ishara's Ek Nazar(Amitabh and Jaya) was also a good movie but not many viewers remember it.The main point is all Dev fans were surprised at BR Ishara directing a Dev Anand film.
For the sake of the convenience , I am only giving the names of the actors which should be taken to mean the characters played by them in the film
Dev Saab plays a famous novelist and the college girls are crazy to meet him. One such girl, Zeenat Aman, gets intimate with him; and they want to get married. The rest of the plot is how seemingly difficult or even impossible it is for the two lovers to unite in matrimony. First, Dev Saab is shown to be already married to Bindu-though it is a failed marriage because Bindu had lied to Dev Saab that she was carrying his child.Then, Bindu introduces Zeenat Aman to Dev Anand as her sister whom she had kept away for several years.Then, Zeenat tells Dev Saab that she is not Bindu's sister but she is her daughter. How can the hero marry the daughter of his wife from a previous marriage? When the hero braces up to take this extreme step, Bindu gives him another shock- that the Hero's brother Abhi Bhatacharya is Zeenat's father.So, how can the hero marry his niece?. But Hero and Heroine don't give up- they go to Abhi Bhatacharya to find out if Bindu was telling the truth. Abhi Bhatacharya says he is not Zeenat's father- her father is possibly one of the three gentlemen with whom the vamp slept before she was crowned Miss India in 1951.Bindu's true story is revealed- she had pleased three gentlemen-IS Johar, Rehman, and Shekhar- to win the Miss India contest. She marries Rehman who is the real father of her daughter. But as she wants freedom , she leaves Rehman and takes her daughter with her whom she leaves in the care of Sajjan in a hill station . After some time Bindu realizes that freedom to a woman can only be available within marriage, she compels Dev Anand to marry her. As she doesn't like the idea of Dev Anand divorcing her and marrying her daughter Zeenat , she sues him on the grounds that Dev Anand has abducted her minor daughter. Dev Saab pleads his own case and is able to prove in the court room that his marriage to Bindu is null and void because she never divorced her husband.And the biggest surprise of them all is that Zeenat is not Bindu's real daughter. Her real daughter is Anju Mahendru.
Dev Anand was fifty one but he didn't look a day older than twenty five.He had a great chemistry with the gorgeous heroine Zeenat, and he was outstanding in the court room scenes. Bindu was the top vamp at that time after her portrayal of Shabnam in Kati Patang, and Mona Darling in Zanjeer; but Ishara saab couldn't use her well. Among the character actors, Asit Sen is impressive in his role as the editor cum literary agent of the hero, and David shines in a cameo .Anju Mahendru is in a very small role but she looks super gorgeous which makes us wonder why Kaka left such a beauty. Laxmikant Pyarelal's music is very good- the best of course is ' Doston Mere Kisse' which has almost become an anthem for the alcohol lovers. The other songs like ' Mujhe Pyar Kar, and ' Pyar Hamara Manjoor Ho Gaya' are also very good.
Dev and Zeenat fans can watch this movie again."
