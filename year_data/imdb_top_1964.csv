My Fair Lady,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058385/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1910s London, snobbish phonetics professor Henry Higgins agrees to a wager that he can make crude flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, presentable in high society. Pompous phonetics Professor Henry Higgins (Sir Rex Harrison) is so sure of his abilities that he takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney working-class girl into someone who can pass for a cultured member of high society. His subject turns out to be the lovely Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), who agrees to speech lessons to improve her job prospects. Higgins and Eliza clash, then form an unlikely bond, one that is threatened by aristocratic suitor Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett).—Jwelch5742 Gloriously witty adaptation of the Broadway musical about Professor Henry Higgins (Sir Rex Harrison), who takes a bet from Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilford Hyde-White) that he can transform unrefined, dirty Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady, and fool everyone into thinking she really is one, too. He does, and thus young aristocrat Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jeremy Brett) falls madly in love with her. But when Higgins takes all of the credit and forgets to acknowledge her efforts, Eliza angrily leaves him for Freddy, and suddenly Higgins realizes he's grown accustomed to her face and can't really live without it.—Tommy Peter A chance meeting between two noted British linguists, Professor Henry Higgins (Sir Rex Harrison) and Colonel Hugh Pickering (Wilford Hyde-White), leads to a wager that will test Higgins' skills. After they hear a cockney flower girl caterwaul in the street, Higgins proposes to transform the girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), into a refined Victorian lady with an aristocratic accent. After some hesitation, Eliza agrees to become their test case.—alfiehitchie Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), an arrogant, irascible professor of phonetics, boasts to a new acquaintance, Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), that he can teach any woman to speak so ""properly"" that he could pass her off as a duchess. The person whom he is shown thus teaching is one Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), a young woman with a horrendous Cockney accent who is selling flowers on the street. After overhearing this, Eliza finds her way to the professor's house and offers to pay for speech lessons, so that she can work in a flower shop. Pickering is intrigued and wagers that Higgins cannot back up his claim; Higgins takes Eliza on free of charge as a challenge to his skills.Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle (Stanley Holloway), a dustman, arrives three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's genuineness, natural gift for language and especially his brazen lack of morals (Doolittle explains, ""Can't afford 'em!"").Eliza goes through many forms of speech training, such as speaking with marbles in her mouth and trying to recite the sentence ""In Hertford, Hereford, Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen"" without dropping the 'h', and to say ""The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain"" rather than ""The rine in spine sties minely in the pline"". At first, she makes no progress (due to Higgins's harsh approach to teaching), but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are exhausted and about to give up, Higgins softens his attitude and gives an eloquent speech about the beauty and history behind the English language. Eliza tries one more time and finally ""gets it""; she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent.Higgins takes her on her first public appearance to Ascot Racecourse, where she makes a good impression with her stilted, but genteel manners, only to shock everyone by a sudden and vulgar lapse into Cockney; ""C'mon Dover, move your bloomin' arse!"". Higgins, who dislikes the pretentiousness of the upper class, partly conceals a grin behind his hand, as if to say ""I wish I had said that!""The bet is won when Eliza successfully poses as a mysterious lady of patently noble rank at an embassy ball, despite the unexpected presence of a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins. Higgins's callous treatment of Eliza afterwards, especially his indifference to her future prospects, leads her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude. When she is gone however, he comes to the horrified realization that he has ""grown accustomed to her face."" Putting aside his resentment about the intrusion on his life and toward women in general, Higgins finds Eliza the next day and attempts to talk her into coming back to him. During a testy exchange, Higgins's ego gets the better of him, and his former student rejects him.Higgins makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that Eliza will be ruined without him and come crawling back. However, his bravado collapses and he is reduced to playing old phonograph recordings of her voice lessons. To Higgins' great delight, Eliza chooses that moment to return to him."
Goldfinger,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While investigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve. British secret agent James Bond is tasked by the Bank of England and Mi6 to investigate gold magnate Auric Goldfinger, who they suspect is building up a vast inventory of gold bars. At first, nothing seems all too special about the gold obsessed tycoon, but after Bond gains knowledge of a secret scheme involving Goldfinger which is about to be initiated; codename ""Operation Grand Slam"", he realizes that the fate of the entire western economy may be at stake if the bullion dealer is not stopped.—goddangwatir Obsessed with gold, seemingly reputable bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger catches the attention of the British Secret Service. As dauntless MI6 agent James Bond closely examines Auric's nefarious activities and underworld connections, the death of an innocent paired with unexpected findings bring to light an elaborate, well-concealed world of greed and sin. Indeed, it seems that ingenious Auric has been planning something big for quite some time now, and no one can stand in the way of the calculating businessman's megalomaniac ambitions. Now, Bond finds himself playing with fire, targeted by the blue-eyed magnate's entire army of henchmen. Can indestructible Bond survive the cold, deadly touch of Goldfinger?—Nick Riganas The Bank of England has discovered that someone is stockpiling vast quantities of gold and suspects international bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger of being involved. The Bank requests that British Agent James Bond be sent to investigate. Bond soon uncovers an audacious plan to commit ""the crime of the century"" and bring economic chaos to the West.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> Beginning innocently enough with a murder, James Bond finds himself investigating Auric Goldfinger, a gold dealer who the Bank of England suspects is stockpiling huge amounts of gold bullion. However, he soon uncovers a far more sinister plot called ""Operation Grand Slam"", and has a fair bit of bowler-hat-dodging to do from Goldfinger's manservant, Oddjob.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> The pre-title teaser sequence shows Bond emerging from the water in a Latin American country. His mission is to destroy the operations of a drug lord, who deals heroin to finance revolutions. Bond infiltrates the man's secret lab and lays out a large quantity of C4 explosive with a timer. Shortly after he meets his contact in a nearby bar, the bomb explodes, destroying much of the drug lord's base of operations. Bond's contact tells him his flight to Miami is confirmed and Bond follows an exotic dancer (his lover on the mission) to her dressing room. Bond takes off his shoulder holster and pistol and kisses the woman. A man emerges from behind an armoire and attacks Bond, who holds the woman up as a shield. He struggles briefly with the henchman and throws him into the bathtub. The man seizes Bond's gun, prompting Bond to throw an electric heater in the water-filled tub, electrocuting the man. Bond leaves, plainly disgusted with the woman who betrayed him.Bond's CIA contact, Felix Leiter, finds the agent in Miami Beach on respite. He informs Bond that M had charged him with a new mission; the observation of a man named Auric Goldfinger (Goldfinger), an international jeweler who is suspected of smuggling. Bond charms his way into Goldfinger's hotel room and finds Jill Masterson, Goldfinger's mistress, watching him play cards through a set of binoculars. From her vantage point, Jill can see Goldfinger's opponent's hand and can relay instructions to Goldfinger, allowing him to cheat and win. Bond disrupts Jill's spying, telling Goldfinger that the Miami Beach police department would arrest him if they found out his scheme. He also orders Goldfinger to begin losing gradually to his opponent.Bond invites Jill back to his own hotel room where they spend the afternoon and evening together. While Bond retrieves another bottle of champagne, he is hit from behind and falls unconscious. (A shadow on the wall shows a bulky figure wearing a brimmed hat.) When Bond awakes, he finds that Jill has been murdered; her entire body has been covered in gold paint and she has died of skin suffocation. Bond calls Leiter immediately to report the incident.Bond reports back to London, meeting with M, who is largely disappointed at the turn of events. He threatens to replace Bond on the mission with 008, however, Bond reassures his boss that he can complete the mission himself. M orders Bond to attend a dinner meeting with a representative from the British Office of Finance to learn more about Goldfinger. As it turns out, the tycoon is a legitimate jeweler and thereby permitted to trade and refine gold legally around the world, yet his means of transporting his gold internationally remains unknown and Bond's mission is to prove if Goldfinger is smuggling his gold illegally. Bond suggests that he and his adversary meet socially and that he'll need some sort of bait to entice Goldfinger. The representative suggests a gold bar smelted by the Nazis during World War II.Bond makes a brief visit to the lab of his weapons specialist, Q, who provides him with two tracking devices and a new car, a 1964 Aston Martin DB5. The car comes equipped with a tracking screen for the bugs that were given to Bond as well as a formidable weapons system (machine guns, oil slick, smokescreen, passenger ejector seat, & tire slashers) as well as bulletproof glass and revolving license plates.Bond meets Goldfinger at a country club and joins him in a game. The two play to the 17th hole and, when Goldfinger suggests that Bond did not merely want to meet to play golf. Bond offers the Nazi gold bar to Goldfinger as a prize for winning the game. While playing the next hole, Bond discovers that, like cards, Goldfinger cheats at golf as well, finding a loose ball in the rough, planted there by Goldfinger's caddy, Oddjob, a large Korean man in a suit and bowler hat. On the next green, Bond switches Goldfinger's ball for the one he found. They play to the last green and Goldfinger seemingly wins the match until Bond points out that he played the wrong ball. As a result, Goldfinger loses the match and any chance of obtaining the gold bar Bond had offered. While his car is being packed up by Oddjob, Bond plants the larger tracker in the car and settles up with Goldfinger for his winnings. Goldfinger warns Bond to stay out of his affairs and orders Oddjob to demonstrate his favorite weapon, his blade-rimmed bowler hat, which he uses to decapitate a nearby marble statue. Goldfinger leaves for the airport, having his car loaded into a cargo plane and boarding it himself for Geneva, Switzerland.Bond follows Goldfinger to Geneva, and while observing him from a mountain switchback above, is nearly hit by a shot from a nearby assassin. Bond pursues the assassin, forcing her off the road with the tire slashers mounted on his car. Not realizing that Bond caused the damage to her car, the driver asks Bond to drive her to the nearest auto garage. Bond notices that she's carrying a wooden case with the initials TM. She tells him they are a set of ice skates. Bond leaves her at the garage and continues his tracking of Goldfinger. He arrives at an industrial plant owned by Goldfinger. Hiding in the forested hills above the plant, he infiltrates the facility at night and overhears an conversation between Goldfinger and a Chinese associate where Goldfinger explains his gold smuggling operation: specific parts of his Roll Royce are solid 18 karat gold, which are smelted at the plant. Bond also hears Goldfinger mention something called ""Operation Grand Slam."" As he leaves the grounds, he sees someone nearby wielding a rifle. He wrestles with the person, discovering it is the woman who seemingly attempted to assassinate Bond earlier. It turns out she is Jill Masterson's sister, Tilly, who wants to kill Goldfinger and had tried unsuccessfully earlier on the mountain road, the same shot that nearly hit Bond. During their struggle, Tilly sets off a tripwire, summoning Goldfinger's security guards to their location. Bond is able to dispatch several guards with his cars weapons system, however, he is captured and Tilly is killed by Oddjob.Bond awakes in Goldfinger's laboratory, strapped to a table. Goldfinger has his operatives activate a giant laser which threatens to cut Bond in half from his crotch upwards. Bond tries to inform Goldfinger that he has full details of his plans and that he'll be replaced by another 00 agent if he dies. Goldfinger, however, does not plan to torture Bond for information, just to kill him. Bond plays his last card, saying that he knows of Operation Grand Slam, as does 008. Goldfinger realizes that he should keep Bond alive so word of his plan doesn't leak.Bond is flown from Geneva to Goldfinger's stud farm near Fort Knox, Kentucky. On the plane, he meets Goldfinger's personal pilot, Pussy Galore, whom makes a point of informing Bond that she is a lesbian and ""immune"" to his charms. When they land, a small squadron of planes lands; they are all female pilots trained by Galore herself. At Goldfinger's ranch, Goldfinger meets with several organized crime associates, telling them of his plan; he will rob the gold depositories at Fort Knox. The gangsters, who had helped Goldfinger smuggle the equipment and personnel needed for the operation into the United States, scoff at his plan, saying the area is too heavily fortified by the United States military. Goldfinger explains to them that his plan will involve using a nerve gas, Delta 9, to pacify the troops stationed nearby. The remainder of Ft. Knox' defenses will then be systematically defeated. Bond, escaping from his holding cell, writes a note describing the operation, while standing underneath one of the models used by Goldfinger in his presentation. He is discovered by Pussy Galore, who takes him to Goldfinger. As they leave the area underneath the model, one of Goldfinger's men releases Delta 9 into the room with the gangsters, killing them all.Outside, one of the gangsters, Mr Solo, is preparing to leave with his fee, $1 million in pure gold, deeming Goldfinger's plan too audacious. As he leaves, Bond slips the note and his smaller tracking device into Solo's pocket. Solo is driven to the airport by Oddjob. On the way, Oddjob deliberately passes the airport exit and turns off on a side road. He kills Solo and drives the car to a nearby auto wrecking yard where it is compacted with Solo's body. Oddjob returns to Goldfinger's ranch with the compacted car where Goldfinger comments, to Bond's dismay, that he needs to retrieve his gold from it.Bond meets again with Goldfinger and begins to discuss Grand Slam, citing the fact that removing $15 billion in bullion from Fort Knox would be logistically impossible, taking several days. The plan would fail quickly considering that the United States armed forces would realize what happened and move in to stop the robbery in a few hours. Goldfinger counters by saying he has no plans to actually steal the gold from the depository; he will detonate a small nuclear bomb inside the vault area. Bond surmises that the entire gold supply of the United States will become radioactive for decades and therefore useless. Bond also predicts that the resulting financial meltdown of the United States economy will force other nations to buy gold from Goldfinger himself, substantially increasing the worth of the tycoon's own gold in his possession by at least ten fold. Furthermore, Goldfinger threatens to detonate the bomb in some random city in retaliation should his plan be thwarted. Pussy Galore meets Bond and takes him on an impromptu tour of the ranch. In a nearby barn, the two match judo moves on each other until Bond is able to gain the upper hand and seduce Pussy.The next morning, Galore's flight squadron sprays the Delta 9 gas over the area surrounding Ft. Knox, pacifying all the troops and population of the area. Goldfinger's ground force, including Bond and Oddjob, move in and easily penetrate the immediate defenses of the fort and move into the vault area. The bomb arrives on a helicopter and is moved into the vault, where Bond is handcuffed to it. However, the gas sprayed by Galore's pilots was a ruse; during their tryst, Bond had somehow been able to convince Pussy to switch the canisters for something harmless. The armed forces of the area, satisfied that they can now prevent the enemy from escaping with their nuclear bomb, move in and surround Goldfinger and his crew, starting a furious battle. Goldfinger closes the vault door, trapping Bond, Oddjob and one of his henchmen inside. Bond manages to retrieve the key for his cuffs from the man after Oddjob kills him and battles with Oddjob directly. Bond is little match for Oddjob himself, but is able to retrieve Oddjob's deadly hat. Throwing it at Oddjob, he misses and it becomes embedded in a nearby set of bars. As Oddjob grabs it to take it out, Bond touches the bars with a severed electrical cable, electrocuting Oddjob, who falls dead. Outside, Goldfinger escapes by killing several guards in the guise of a US Army Colonel and flies off in Galore's helicopter.Bond races to the bomb, trying desperately to disarm it. The US army enters the vault, lead by Leiter. One of the men with Leiter shuts the bomb off easily; the timer on the bomb clearly reads 007. Bond is scheduled to fly to the White House for a personal meeting with the President. While on the private jet to Washington, Goldfinger emerges, pointing a (golden) pistol at Bond. He tells Bond that he intends to kill the agent and fly the plane to Cuba. Bond asks where Pussy is, distracting Goldfinger, and attacking him to seize the gun. As they struggle, the gun goes off, blowing out a window, causing the plane to depressurize. Goldfinger is sucked outside and the plane plummets. Watching on a radar screen, Felix and the Air Force see a blip coming off the plane's radar signature. A search party is sent out, one that fails to notice a parachute nearby. Pussy begins waving to the helicopter but Bond grabs her, covering them with the parachute, cheekily saying they don't need to be rescued at that moment."
The Carpetbaggers,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057917/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jonas Cord is a disagreeable young tycoon who's building planes, directing films, and catting around on the corporate make in 1930s Hollywood. Upon the death of his father in 1928, Jonas Cord Jr., who has thus far led a wild life, assumes control of the Cord business empire centered on a Nevada chemical company, that control despite the animosity that existed between father and son about business issues. With the exception of a few trusted people including his best friend, aging cowboy Nevada Smith, business manager ""Mac"" McAllister, and longtime butler Jedidiah, Jonas in turn trusts no one in his effort to take complete control of the business and his life, buying out other ""friends"", business associates and adversaries in his ""I know best"" attitude. In the process, he begins to diversify his business interests into areas which he either has an interest and/or believes will be industries of the immediate future, including aviation and the movie industry. The poor way he treats people extends to his personal life, including the many women closest to him, such as his stepmother, Rina Marlowe, who was his girlfriend before she married his father, and who would become his wife, Monica Winthrop, the daughter of a business associate. The question becomes if this life is sustainable for him, especially as people try to usurp him, and those he trusts may no longer be able to tolerate his behavior, which he may not be able to let go of in much of it stemming from issues ingrained into him when he was a child.—Huggo George Peppard plays a hard-driven industrialist more than a little reminiscent of Howard Hughes. While he builds airplanes, directs movies, and breaks hearts, his friends and lovers try to reach his human side--and find that it's an uphill battle. The film's title is a metaphor for self-promoting tycoons who perform quick financial takeovers, impose dictatorial controls for short-term profits, then move on to greener pastures.—Jeanne Baker <jbaker@erim.org>"
A Fistful of Dollars,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058461/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A wandering gunfighter plays two rival families against each other in a town torn apart by greed, pride, and revenge. Drifter gunman Joe (Clint Eastwood) arrives in the Mexican village of San Miguel at the border of the United States of America, and befriends the owner of the local bar, Silvanito. Joe discovers that the town is dominated by two gangster lords: John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy) and the cruel Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè). When Joe kills four men of Baxter's gang, he is hired by Ramón's brother Esteban Rojo (Sieghardt Rupp) to join their gang. However, Joe decides to work for both sides, playing one side against the other.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Flat broke, a taciturn, amoral sharp-shooter rides into the dusty, sun-bleached border town of San Miguel, where everyone is either rich or dead. Torn apart by two feuding families--the corrupt Baxters and the murderous Rojos--who fight for control, the sleepy town provides the perfect opportunity for profit. Before long, the nameless stranger embarks on a dangerous mission to play each gang off against the other in a deadly battle of wits. Of course, all eyes are set on the grand prize. How far is a man willing to go for a fistful of dollars?—Nick Riganas A Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) arrives at a little Mexican border town named San Miguel. He is quickly introduced to the feud between two families vying to gain control of the town: the Rojo brothers, consisting of Don Miguel (Antonio Prieto) (the eldest and nominally in charge), Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) (the most headstrong) and Ramón (the most capable and intelligent, played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would reappear in For a Few Dollars More as the psychopathic El Indio), and the family of so-called ""town sheriff"", John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy).The Stranger quickly spies an opportunity to make a ""fistful of dollars"" and decides to play both families against each other. His opportunity comes when a detachment of Mexican soldiers escorting a shipment of gold passes through the town. The gold is ostensibly being delivered to a troop of American soldiers at the border river in exchange for a shipment of modern American weapons, but after following the Mexican troops, the Stranger watches from hiding as they are massacred by members of the Rojo gang, disguised in American uniforms and led by Ramon Rojo.The Stranger takes two of the bodies to a nearby cemetery and sells information to both sides that two soldiers survived the attack. Both sides race to the cemetery, the Baxters to get the ""survivors"" to testify against the Rojos, and the Rojos to silence them. The factions engage in a fierce gunfight, but Ramon manages to kill (as he believes) the ""survivors"" and Esteban captures John Baxter's son, Antonio. While the Rojos and the Baxters are busy, the Stranger takes the opportunity to search the Rojo hacienda, but accidentally knocks out Ramón's beautiful prisoner and unwilling mistress, Marisol (Marianne Koch), when she surprises him. He takes her to the Baxters, who arrange for a prisoner swap with the Rojos.The day of the exchange, the Stranger learns Marisol's history from Silvanito (José Calvo), the innkeeper: ""... a happy little family until trouble comes along. And trouble is the name of Ramon, claiming the husband cheated at cards, which wasn't true. He gets the wife to live with him as hostage."" That night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger rides out and frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house to make it look like it was attacked by a large band. The Stranger tells Marisol, her husband and their son to leave town, and gives them some money to live on. Marisol then asks the Stranger, ""Why do you do this for us?"" And for the first and only time, the Stranger provides some insight for his actions when he replies to Marisol, ""Why? Because I knew someone like you once. There was no one there to help. Now get moving.""The Rojos capture and beat the Stranger up after this betrayal, but he escapes, killing Chico (Mario Brega) in the process, with the help of the coffin maker, Piripero (Joseph Egger, who would also resurface in For a Few Dollars More). Believing the Stranger to be protected by the Baxters, the Rojos set fire to the Baxter home and massacre all the residents when they are forced to flee the flames, including John Baxter, his son and his wife Consuelo (Margarita Lozano). The Rojos become the only gang left in San Miguel.The Man with No Name returns to town to engage the Rojos in a dramatic duel. He first rescues Silvanito, who was tortured to reveal the Stranger's whereabouts. The Man with No Name has a steel chest plate hidden under his clothing and taunts Ramon to ""aim for the heart"" as Ramon's rifle shots bounce off. The Man with No Name then challenges Ramon to reload his rifle faster than he can reload his pistol. He shoots and kills Ramon after killing the remaining Rojos, except Esteban (who is shot by Silvanito), and rides away."
A Hard Day's Night,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058182/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Over two ""typical"" days in the life ofThe Beatles, the boys struggle to keep themselves and SirPaul McCartney's mischievous grandfather in check while preparing for a live TV performance. A day and a half in the life of the Fab Four leading up to a televised concert gig. The boys seem to be constantly on the run, from their crazed fans and from their manager, who is constantly trying to rein them in. Sir Ringo Starr however is arrested and still isn't in the studio half an hour before air time. With Sir Paul McCartney's grandfather available for additional comical relief, the group performs a dozen or so songs.—garykmcd John, Paul, George and Ringo - collectively known asThe Beatles- leave their Liverpool home base to head to London where they are to perform on television. There, they have a few official engagements beforehand, such as rehearsals at the studio and a press conference, otherwise they are stuck at the hotel. In addition, they want some free time out just to be lads, which may be difficult seeing as to throngs of adoring and screaming primarily young female fans following them wherever they are known to be. They also encounter a few people who would rather not associate with them because of different sensibilities, a few people who, when seeing only one at a time, wonder if they are who they look to be, and a few people who mistake them for someone else. Sheltered Ringo, in particular, takes advantage of what little freedom they have, which may cause problems for them all in the end. Helping them navigate through all these issues but also ensuring they do their work as celebrities are two of their managers, Norm and Shake, who are accompanying them on this trip and who are having a disagreement about height. Also along for the ride is Paul's paternal grandfather, John McCartney, who Paul's mum believes needs an outing to nurse a broken heart. Despite his outwardly innocent appearance, McCartney Sr. ends up being a mischievous soul, whose misadventures they all have to get him out of time and time again. But at least McCartney Sr. is clean, ""very clean""...—Huggo Capturing John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in their electrifying element, this cult classic is a wildly irreverent journey through this pastiche of a day in the life of The Beatles during 1964. The band have to use all their guile and wit to avoid the pursuing fans and press to reach their scheduled television performance, in spite of Paul's troublemaking grandfather and Ringo's arrest. The plot is a study of a day in the life of the Fab Four beginning with them running from their adoring fans to catch a train. Every plot point circles around the band getting to a television show in order to perform a live concert, and within this stream of action is a series of slapstick, zany, and otherwise wacky bits of funniness. One obstacle in the works is Paul McCartney's babysitting of his grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a first class mixer always getting into mischief. It becomes one of the running jokes in the film that Brambell is a ""clean old man,"" at least physically (this contrasts with Brambell's most famous role as Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son where he was a ""dirty old man"" both physically and psychologically). Ringo Starr gets a sense of liberation and goes off on his own to find happiness only to land in jail for loitering. John Lennon fires playful barbs at TV director (Victor Spinetti), whose biggest worry is that if for some reason the Beatles stand him up his next job will be doing ""news in Welsh."" One great story line is with George Harrison, in which he is mistaken for an actor auditioning for some trendy TV show for some trend setter hostess. The earnest demeanor of the casting head and his associates is undercut by George's declaration that she is a well-known drag. Norman Rossington and John Junkin as The Beatles' managers are stalwart English character actors who fill out the cast and support the general lunacy of the film with a more traditional presence, but still sustain an on-going battle about one being taller than the other. Anna Quayle has a great bit with John Lennon about his being someone he's not. The whole thing ends with an ear-shattering concert and the band yet again running from the adoring fans."

Father Goose,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058092/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During World War II, a man persuaded to live on an isolated island and spot aircraft finds himself responsible for a teacher and several students, all female. During World War II, South Sea beachcomber Walter Eckland is coerced into spying on planes passing over an island. He gets more than he bargained for as schoolteacher Catherine Frenau arrives on the run from the Japanese with her pupils in tow.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> On an island in the South Seas, Walter Eckland lives a quiet life. That changes when he's forced to serve as a lookout for the Allies, watching for enemy ships. Eckland, whose main interest is drinking, proves bad at his job and is sent to fetch a replacement from another island. Instead he finds a stranded teacher, Catherine, and her pupils. After Eckland brings the group to his island, romantic sparks fly between the prim schoolmistress and the slovenly loner.—Jwelch5742 It's 1942, and the war in the Pacific is not going well for the Allies. At the moment, the Australians are evacuating the island of Salamaua, taking what they can and destroying the rest. In all the confusion, scruffy beachcomber Walter Eckland (Cary Grant) arrives, ties his launch to the pier and begins helping himself to cans of His Majesty's Royal Navy petrol.A young officer, Stebbings (Jack Good), spots him and indignantly asks what he's doing. Walter pauses long enough to look at Stebbings, and say, incredulously, ""Do you know who I am?"" Taken aback, Stebbings admits, ""Well, no, I don't."" ""Well...we'll let it go this time,"" says Walter, magnanimously, and resumes stacking cans by his boat.In the harbormaster's office, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard) is talking on the radio to the admiral, reassuring him that everything will go as planned. Stebbings bursts in, and tries to ask Frank if he knows the cheeky Yank at the far end of the pier. Frank motions him to hush, then tells the admiral that yes, all the coast watcher positions have been assigned...all except for Matalava. But at that moment, Frank catches sight of Walter and his face brightens. He tells the admiral he has found his man for Matalava. As they walk down the pier, Frank tells Stebbings that Walter is a hard-drinking drop-out from civilization, but he knows the islands like the back of his hand and is as sharp as they come.Frank and Walter greet each other in a way that suggests they share a certain amount of history. Frank explains the coast watching service to Walter, and asks him to go Matalava, just for a while...until they can find someone permanent. Walter cheerfully refuses. Frank immediately turns to Stebbings and orders him to confiscate all the small boats on the pier (although Walter's is obviously the only one). At first Walter protests, but he soon realizes Frank will indeed follow through on the order, so he cheerfully agrees to go to Matalava. Frank is not fooled. In the next scene, Walter arrives at Matalava...escorted by a Class B RAN motor launch, with Frank and Stebbings overseeing Walter's progress from the bridge. As sailors transport Walter's supplies to the island, Stebbings asks Frank what's to prevent Walter from sailing out again the moment they leave. Frank chides Stebbings for having so little faith in his fellow man...and orders him to get underway by turning hard a-port. Stebbings starts to obey, then stops, uncertain...he asks Frank to confirm the order, then he nods happily, and orders the coxswain to turn hard a-port. As the launch turns, it tears a big, ragged hole in Walter's hull just above the waterline.Using his dinghy (which is equipped with a small outboard motor), Walter tows the launch to a tiny, sheltered lagoon, and makes his way to a little grass hut just off the beach. The supplies have been left here; there's a cot, table and chairs, radio, and charts of Japanese planes and ships on the walls. Frank calls up on the radio to give Walter further instruction on his duties, and on the use of code names when talking on the radio. Frank is Big Bad Wolf, Stebbings is Little Bo Peep...and Walter is to be Mother Goose. Frank hastily switches off the radio on Walter's angry, profane response.""I don't see we've accomplished anything,"" says Stebbings. ""After all you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."" ""Oh, if he gets thirsty enough, Stebbings, he'll drink,"" replies Frank, dryly. And sure enough, a moment later Walter calls to ask about the case of whiskey that was delivered with the supplies. Frank tells Walter his men have hidden the bottles in spots he will never find on his own. Whenever Walter calls to report any Japanese planes or ships he's seen, he'll be given directions on where to find one bottle. Walter immediately tells Frank that he's seen a couple of Japanese planes, and starts giving him a detailed description. ""CONFIRMED sightings, Walter,"" says Frank, interrupting Walter's attempted ruse.Walter resigns himself to an indefinite stay on Matalava...at least until he can repair his boat. He works on it whenever possible...and diligently reports any Japanese plane and ship movements...and loses no time applying for the promised bottle afterward.Stebbings informs Frank that another of the coast watchers, Perry on Bundy Island, is ringed in by the Japanese and requesting to be withdrawn. A quick look at their map shows that Walter is the only one near enough to help. Frank calls Walter and offers him a bargain: if he'll go to Bundy, and pick up Perry, Perry will help him fix his boat and stay on at Matalava in his place. Walter refuses at first, shrewdly guessing Frank hasn't told him everything. Then he calls Frank back and makes a counter offer: after all, a man in a seven-foot dinghy traveling over all those miles of open sea would need a little comfort...after a failed attempt at bartering, Frank agrees to provide directions to all the remaining bottles of whiskey.Walter lands at the south jetty on Bundy after dark, as instructed...but Perry isn't waiting there for him, as promised. He cautiously makes his way to Perry's shack...and stumbles just outside over what looks like a grave, marked with a rough cross. He goes inside and sees that the hut has been strafed from the air...everything has been shot to pieces.He hears a faint noise, turns, and sees a shadow behind the window blind. He creeps over, pulls it up suddenly, and finds himself pointing his gun at a lovely, young Frenchwoman (Leslie Caron)--who is pointing a gun right back at him. He asks her about Perry, and she answers if that's the man who lived here, she found him dead and buried him. A Japanese patrol boat passes...they duck...the light sweeps over them, but they are not seen. Walter tells her they should get out of there, and she motions to someone out of sight, and whispers, ""Come on, we're leaving."" Walter watches dumbfounded as seven little schoolgirls, each in a neat uniform and hat, and carrying a suitcase, file past the window and follow the woman down to the jetty. Walter protests that his little dinghy won't hold all of them. ""All right,"" says the woman, ""Tell me which of them you want to leave behind?"" Realizing he's beaten, he helps them all into the dinghy. But he throws away all their luggage, growling ""This isn't the Queen Mary,"" when they protest.The trip back is harrowing...the dinghy rides very low in the water. At one point, two Japanese destroyers pass on either side of them in the dark, and the little craft is almost swamped in their wake: all must bail to keep it afloat. When they arrive at Matalava, Walter angrily jumps off the boat and storms up to the hut, leaving the girls to make their own way. He calls Frank on the radio and accuses him of tricking him into picking up the girls. But Frank is as puzzled by their presence as Walter, and the woman takes the radio mike to explain. She is Catherine Freneau, daughter of the French Consul at Rabaul...the girls are the daughters of other diplomats. They were being evacuated to Australia when their pilot got a distress call from a downed bomber. He dropped them off at Bundy, promising to return for them...but then the Japanese landed on the island.Frank asks them to stand by while they figure something out. Walter opens a bottle of whiskey, and drinks...opens a can of food, and begins to eat out of the can as the girls look on. Catherine points out that they could all do with some food. He tosses a can to her, and goes on eating. She sighs, and begins to order the girls to straighten up the hut, clean off the table, open some tins...she asks Walter where he keeps his tea things. ""Tea things,"" he mutters, derisively. He watches warily, but only intervenes when one of the girls starts to move his hard-won whiskey.Frank comes back on the radio to inform them that he can't take the girls off Matalava...they may have to stay there for several weeks. He will arrange a parachute drop in a couple of days, to deliver additional supplies. Walter is outraged. He wants them off his island, immediately...especially Catherine, whom he calls ""Miss Goody Two-Shoes."" For her part, Catherine tells Frank that Walter is ""a rude, foul-mouthed, filthy beast."" But there's nothing to be done, they're all stuck with each other.Catherine sends the girls outside, and tries to convince Walter that they must work together, and their main concern must be the children: He must let them have the hut, and help her keep them safe and secure; above all, he must stop swearing and drinking in front of them...after all, he is the ""Father"" figure. Walter retorts that he has no intention of being a ""Father"" figure...all he intends to be is a ""Total Stranger"" figure. He tells her to get out and let him get some sleep. He defiantly takes off his pants in front of her, and lies down on the cot. She leaves...but a few moments later her little guerrilla fighters attack the hut with sticks and coconuts. Walter comes outside with a blanket wrapped around his waist, pants over his arm, and a bottle in his hand...""Lady,"" he says to her threateningly, ""you're making a powerful enemy."" But it's an empty threat, and they all know it. He retreats to his boat, where he will stay for the duration.Later, one of the girls comes down to the boat to fetch him: Frank is on the radio, again. Walter hurries off to the shack...not noticing the girl stays behind, and beckons to the others, who have hidden in the trees nearby. Walter finds Catherine alone in the shack, mending a piece of clothing. He looks around nonchalantly for the whiskey...""I asked you to stop drinking in front of the girls,"" she says, primly, ""but you wouldn't."" She has hidden it all away again, to Walter's supreme frustration!Frank is no longer on the radio, but he left a message, and after some suspicious fumbling and stalling, Catherine finally produces it. Frank has been unable to arrange a parachute drop...they'll have to make do with what they have. Catherine asks Walter if he would consider sharing some of his personal belongings with her and the girls. He tells her he'd trade for his whiskey. She declines, and he leaves.As he starts back down to the boat, the girls run past him one by one, each concealing a bundle of clothing, tools, blankets, which they've taken from his boat. As the last little girl runs by, Walter finally gets wise...he tries to stop her, and she hits him on the toe with the hammer she's stealing. By the time he recovers, all the girls are inside the hut with Catherine standing guard. Out-maneuvered again, he retreats to his empty, empty boat.He keeps a watch on the hut, and on Catherine and the girls, now wearing bits, pieces and weirdly-altered versions of his clothes. There's Elizabeth (Stephanie Berrington), 15, pretty, but shy and bespectacled; Anne (Pip Sparke), 13, sullen and aloof, whose unfailing answer to every question is, ""I want to go home!""; Harriet (Jennifer Berrington), 11, a cheerful tomboy who prefers to be called Harry; the French sisters, Angelique, ten, and Dominique, nine (Laurelle and Nicole Felsette), who speak only French; Christine (Verina Greenlaw), about eight, a no-nonsense little Brit, and her invisible friend, Gretchen (age indeterminate!); Jenny (Sharyl Locke), also British, around six or seven, very quiet and sad. He waits for his chance: he'll give up the hut, and they can have the clothes...but he wants that whiskey!One day he spots a Japanese destroyer in the bay, and an inflatable raft with four armed Japanese sailors coming ashore. He runs up to the shack and finds only Catherine and Christine there. The rest are on the beach gathering coconuts. He and Catherine run down quickly to find them. They find four of them coming back from the beach, their arms full of coconuts, and send them back to the shack to hide. They continue to the beach, where they find Anne perched precariously, but more or less hidden, high up in a palm near where the sailors are landing. Jenny is nowhere to be seen. Walter motions to Anne to stay still, and he and Catherine crouch down behind a couple of fallen logs. The sailors set off down the beach, away from them...just as Jenny appears, oblivious to what's going on, to add two more coconuts to the pile under the palm. Walter whispers to Catherine that if Jenny makes a sound they're done...Catherine murmurs that Jenny hasn't spoken since she left her parents. ""She can still scream, can't she?"" says Walter grimly, and runs swiftly to Jenny while the sailors' backs are turned. He puts his hand over her mouth to silence any outcry (managing not to cry out himself, when Jenny gives him a good, hard bite), and hides her until the sailors are out of sight. Then he brings her back, frightened and whimpering, to Catherine, who comforts and quiets her.It turns out that Catherine understands Japanese, and she tells Walter that they are trying to find turtles for soup. Unable to find any, the Japanese return to the dinghy, and shove off. They don't leave a moment too soon: Anne is slipping from her perch. Walter manages to get under her, and, quietly but painfully, break her fall. When the sailors are back on board, and the ship is out of sight, they all leave the beach. No one notices that the bright red bandanna Anne was wearing (one of Walter's) has snagged in the fronds of the palm.Walter is working on his boat when Jenny suddenly appears, staring silently over the railing at him. He looks back at her for a moment, surprised...then tells her to beat it. She produces a bottle of whiskey, and sets it on the railing near him. Dumbfounded, he looks at it, then at her...and says, ""Thank you"", in a slightly hoarse voice. He removes the cap, takes a healthy swig, and thanks her again. He asks her name--she doesn't answer. He produces a small, silver whistle on a chain, and asks if she'd like to have it. She nods. ""All you have to do is repeat three words after me."" She nods again. ""Elephant,"" he says. After a pause, she repeats, ""Elephant."" ""Rhinoceros,"" says Walter. ""Rhinoceros,"" she repeats. ""Wrong!"" says Walter. ""Why?"" she demands, indignantly. ""No, not 'Why'..,"" says Walter, "" 'Wrong!' That was the third word--you lose."" He puts the whistle back in his pocket...and Jenny snatches back the whiskey. Muttering about poor losers, Walter hands her the whistle, and she returns the whiskey. He takes another swig, and when he looks again, Harry is standing next to Jenny, smiling happily. They offer to help him fix his boat, and he tells them they can swab down the deck. Soon all the girls are there, working on the boat in one capacity or another.Catherine arrives, looking for the girls, and she's astonished to find them here. She orders them back to the shack for lessons, but Jenny protests that they'd rather stay and help Mr. Eckland. Catherine stares at Jenny in surprise, and Elizabeth brightly explains that Mr. Eckland got her to talk. ""Better do as she says,"" Walter tells the girls, and reluctantly they head back to the shack. A little jealous, Catherine says tartly that next time she needs the girls to do anything, she'll just call on him. ""It's not my fault that boats are more fun than lessons,"" he replies, mildly. As he's talking, he wades out into the lagoon a little way. He crouches, and after a moment plunges his hands into the water and skillfully flips a fish onto the shore. ""Why don't you teach them something useful, like that?"" he says. Catherine tries it, but fails miserably. Walter approaches to show her how it's done...but standing so close to her, he suddenly realizes that he's very...attracted to her. Startled, he backs away. Confused, Catherine asks, ""Mr. Eckland, are you or aren't you going to teach me to fish?"" After a moment's consideration, he replies, ""I aren't"". He wades deeper into the lagoon, and begins to swim away, while she watches, mystified.Catherine and Anne are foraging for berries, near a little pond. Catherine slips off a log, into the water. ""Oh... Something bit me"", she exclaims, and looks at two little holes near her left ankle. ""A snake, a snake!"" cries Anne, pointing to a long, dark shape in the water nearby. Catherine jumps out of the water, and they flee to the hut. After a moment, the dark shape emerges fully from the water: it's only a branch, with thorns and a couple of wilted leaves.Catherine is on the cot surrounded by the girls when Walter comes in, summoned by one of the French sisters. Catherine briefly explains what happened; he sends the girls out, and examines the tiny wound gravely. With his knife (sterilized over the stove's flame) he makes a small cut across the marks, and attempts to suck out the venom. Then he calls Frank on the radio: ""What kind of snakes have they got around here?"" he asks. ""Uh, is that a rhetorical question, I hope?"" asks Frank, warily. ""Miss Freneau went and found one,"" replies Walter, evenly. Frank sends Stebbings for a doctor, and tells Walter to stand by. ""And Walter,"" he adds, ""until we know what we're dealing with, don't try to be a movie hero and suck out the venom, ok?"" Walter and Catherine look at each other a little sheepishly.Frank returns shortly, and asks Walter to put on the headphones. The doctor tells him there are three varieties of snakes indigenous to the islands, all extremely poisonous. Nothing can be done for Catherine...the end will come very soon: She'll experience a general feeling of numbness, then dizziness, and then death. The doctor tells Walter to make her comfortable, and recommends the liberal use of any strong, analgesic sedative he may have on hand to do so. ""I don't have anything like that,"" protests Walter, and Frank replies, ""Nonsense, Walter, you've been using one for years.""Walter persuades Catherine to tell him where he can find a bottle of whiskey...best medicine for snakebite, after all. She drains her first coconut cupful quickly...and as he pours another, she tells him she doesn't disapprove of drinking, only excessive drinking. As she's working on her third cupful, she says that after the death of her mother, she served as hostess at all consulate functions. ""We had martinis before dinner, white wine with the fish,"" she says, running through the checklist, ""red wine with the main course, champagne with dessert, cognac with coffee, and port after dinner."" Walter takes a swig of the whiskey and comments enviously, ""Sounds GREAT!""After her fifth drink, Catherine observes that it's getting very hot in the shack...and seems unable to keep from waving her very limber legs in the air and giggling. She asks Walter what her blood tasted like. After some discussion as to whether or not it was too salty, Walter decides the girls don't need to watch all of this, and closes the blinds and draws the curtain over the door. They can still listen, though, and while they're doing so, Anne suddenly shouts she's going to kill that rotten snake, and runs off toward the pond.Catherine admits she's obsessively disciplined. ""I'm a picture-straightener,"" she laments. ""Whenever I see a picture hanging crookedly, I straighten it. And I brush my teeth every morning and every night, no matter what."" She tells him that she's lived in 11 countries and speaks seven languages...that she once had a fiance named Cesare...he worked for the Italian Consulate, and whenever he kissed her, he would first ask ""Permesso"", and afterward he would say ""Grazie."" She giggles wildly, and tells Walter that Cesare would never have done to her leg what he did. She tells him earnestly that she liked what he did to her leg.Then she asks Walter what ""she"" was like. ""What 'who' was like?"" asks Walter. ""The woman who drove you to this,"" she says, gesturing all around her, to the shack, the island...to his solitary life. ""It was no woman,"" he replies, ""it was a necktie."" Believing that she will not live to pass the story on, he tells her that eight years ago, he'd been a professor of history at an American university. One morning, in a rush, he'd gone to class without his necktie...and they'd refused to let him in. He'd thought they'd care more about the content of his brain than what he wore around his neck, but he'd looked at them, then, and realized they all wore neckties. They all looked the same, talked the same, and thought the same, and they weren't learning anything...at least nothing he had to teach...and they were perpetuating the same old problems. So he'd packed up and departed for the South Seas the next day.Catherine listens with interest...then giggles to think that he was once a school teacher...then remarks that she's beginning to feel numb. Recognizing this symptom of approaching death, he helps her lie back on the cot. ""Oh, I'm dizzy,"" she murmurs, ""I'm so dizzy!"" She suddenly sits up and exclaims, ""Oh, dear!"" in a surprised little voice...and passes out cold.Walter assumes she is dead. Slowly, gently, he takes the cup of whiskey from her hand, crosses her hands on her breast and pulls the blanket up over her face. Then he drinks the whiskey left in her cup (waste not, want not!)Meanwhile, Anne has returned, carrying the snake-resembling branch in her hand. ""What's that?"" asks Elizabeth. ""It's the snake,"" replies Anne. ""That's not a snake,"" says Jenny. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. ""You ninny!"" declares Christine. ""Oh, la!"" sighs one of the little French girls.Walter calls Frank: ""It's over,"" he says, ""Miss Freneau is...gone."" ""I'm sorry, Walter,"" says Frank. ""Have the girls been told?"" ""No,"" replies Walter, ""Stick around, why don't you...I may need you later.""Walter comes out and sits down on the porch, and the girls gather around him. He tells them gently that Miss Freneau is gone. They tell him earnestly that she's not. Anne produces the stick, and he asks, ""What's that?"" ""It's the snake,"" says Anne. ""Well, that's not a snake,"" he replies. ""It LOOKED like a snake,"" says Anne. She hands it to him, he looks at it, and after a moment, agrees, ""That looks like a snake."" He goes back inside, and pulls the cover back from Catherine's face. Her eyes open, and she looks at him, quizzically....""Is it morning already?"" she asks, and he covers her up again. He goes back to the radio, and calls Frank. Frank has summoned the chaplain to say a few words of comfort. ""Never mind,"" says Walter. ""Miss Freneau's alive. It's the snake that's dead."" Leaving Frank sputtering on the radio, he takes what's left of the bottle of whiskey, and heads back to his boat.He's tinkering with the patch he's rigged for the hull when Catherine, walking gingerly due to a monstrous hangover, comes in to talk to him. She asks him if she said or did anything for which she'd need to apologize. He tells her no...except when she put the flower between her teeth and danced naked around the room. ""I couldn't' have done that!"" she protests, then asks doubtfully, ""Did I?"" He asks her what she does remember. She replies nothing, really, and he relaxes. Or at least, she adds, nothing after his story about the necktie. He explodes. He shouts at her that he never wants to hear about that again. She doesn't see why it should bother him so much, she'd thought he was running away from something much worse. He shouts that he wasn't running away, he was escaping...from hypocrites like her who have to get drunk to let themselves go. ""If you'd start letting men wear their own pants, maybe they'd feel they could touch you without asking 'Permesso',"" he shouts. Catherine slaps his face, crisply. He thinks about it...and slaps her back, not hard, but with sincerity. She isn't hurt, physically, but her face crumples into tears, and she runs off the boat. Walter watches her go with the beginnings of shame on his face.Later, as the girls are sitting down to dinner, Walter arrives at the front door. ""Look,"" says Jenny, in wonder, ""he's combed his hair."" ""And he's actually wearing socks,"" says Christine, awed. He apologizes for interrupting, and says he thought that if they had any extra food, he might... Catherine jumps up to prepare a plate for him. She is wearing the suit jacket and skirt she wore when they first met. They look at each other shyly, knowingly, and she sits down and passes the plate she has fixed for him down the table.""I'm tired of tinned beef,"" says Anne. ""Why can't we ever have fish?"" ""Professor Eckland was giving me fishing lessons,"" says Catherine, demurely...""but he never finishes what he starts!"" Walter chokes on the bite of food he's just swallowed...the nearest girls all begin to pound on his back, while the others shout advice. In the midst of the confusion, practical little Jenny brings him a bottle of whiskey. He takes off the cap and prepares to have a swig...but Catherine says, ""Uh-uh-uh, Mr. Eckland,"" and he reluctantly, but respectfully, puts the bottle aside. Shuddering a little, he has a sip of coconut milk instead.Suddenly, they hear a plane...very loud and close. A Japanese pilot has spotted the red bandanna in the coconut tree, and is flying by it repeatedly, trying to figure it out. Walter runs out of the shack, and watches the plane from behind a palm tree, as it circles around. When it's gone, he immediately calls Frank. But Frank is unimpressed, convinced this is another ruse on Walter's part to get off the island. Angry, Walter stalks out of the shack, knowing that at some point the plane will come back.Later, Catherine comes down to his boat, to talk to him about the girls. She notices that the hole has been patched and he's working on the engine now. The talk turns to their own situation, and raised voices follow as they try to deny they have feelings for each other. Finally, after Catherine calls Walter a drunken escapist, and he calls her a frustrated spinster, Catherine slaps Walter's face again...and Walter slaps her right back. But instead of running away this time, Catherine gets a very determined look on her face, and slaps him again. Walter pauses, considering what to do next.Stebbings calls to Frank, and tells him that Walter is requesting a chaplain. ""Good heavens,"" Frank exclaims, ""he's finally killed her!"" ""No,"" declares Stebbings, ""they want to get married!"" ""Married?!?"" says Frank, astounded, ""Goody Two Shoes and The Filthy Beast?!?""A chaplain is summoned, and a sailor with an accordion. Catherine has put her hair up, and all the girls have dressed in their neat school uniforms. Walter has dressed up again, and even fastened his collar button. Harry removes her necktie and offers it to Walter. ""Oh, no thank you, Harry,"" says Catherine, ""neckties don't suit Mr. Eckland,"" signifying that she's ready to accept him ""as is"".Frank says he needs to fill out a little paper work on their behalf...they each tell their full name for the record, and each smiles a little at hearing the other's for the first time. Frank asks the name of the maid of honor, Catherine supplies Elizabeth's name, and Elizabeth looks pleased. Frank asks the name of the best man...Walter looks around at the girls, and finally announces, ""Harry MacGregor."" Harry smiles radiantly.The sailor begins to play ""Oh, Promise Me"" on his accordion, and the chaplain begins to read the text. Just as he asks if there are any objections to the marriage, the angry sound of an airplane engine interrupts them. Walter runs to the door, and looks up...the Japanese fighter plane has returned, and is lining up for a strafing run on the shack. They dive for cover just in time, as bullets rip through the shack. The plane turns around for a second run, and they scurry out to hide in the trees. Walter darts back inside, while the plane turns around for a third run...he interrupts the chaplain who is droning on about Walter taking this woman, and asks for Frank. He tells Frank the plane has returned. Frank is still doubtful, but Walter leaves the mike open so Frank can hear the bullets from the plane's last run, and Frank hurries off to make arrangements to get them all off the island.Catherine runs into the shack to make sure Walter's all right, and the chaplain asks if there's anything he can do. The plane has gone, so Walter tells the chaplain to finish the ceremony. Lying under the table in the ruined shack, and using a band-aid for a ring, Walter and Catherine are pronounced man and wife. Frank breaks in at this point, and tells Walter that an American sub is running submerged a few miles away. When they surface at nightfall, he'll get a radio message to them, and they should be able to make Matalava by dawn. He advises them to stay away from the hut, to sleep on the beach and be ready to signal the sub when it arrives.That night, as Walter and Catherine keep watch over the sleeping girls, she whispers to him, ""You'll not be coming with us, will you?"" ""I can't leave the boat,"" he replies. ""It must be a good one,"" she says, wistfully. ""Good or bad, it's all the dowry you're going to get,"" he responds. ""I'm thinking of starting a charter service, after the war...somewhere around the Solomons or maybe the New Hebrides. There'll be good money for anybody with a boat who knows the islands."" Walter, it seems, has plans to rejoin the human race for Catherine's sake.At dawn, they hear the sound of a heavy engine approaching. But as the ship comes into view, they see it's not the promised American submarine, it's a Japanese patrol boat. Walter hurries the girls off the beach, telling Catherine to hide with them at his launch. Trying to distract and delay them, Walter runs up to the shack, and sets it on fire. Two rubber rafts have landed, with a dozen or so armed Japanese sailors. He ducks them as they run toward the shack, and runs down to their rafts on the beach, slashing them with his knife to deflate them.Catherine and the girls are hiding, but come out when he returns to the launch. Catherine points to the transom, where Walter has neatly painted ""Catherine"", with ""Matalava"" underneath, and asks when he did that. ""Last night while you slept,"" he says...and adds in a meaningful tone, ""There wasn't much else to do."" He tells them to get into the dinghy, but to stay hidden in the lagoon. The sub will not surface while the patrol boat is there, but they will be watching, and he will decoy the patrol boat out past the reef where the sub can sink it. As he jumps into the launch, Catherine calls after him to be careful...""I look simply awful in black,"" she says.On the submarine, just outside the bay, the captain and the mate are taking turns watching the hut burn through the periscope. They see Walter's launch dart out of the lagoon, and watch as the patrol boat comes about to pursue it. The patrol boat is firing on and lobbing shells at the launch...some of the shots come perilously close. The captain watches tensely as both boats approach the reef, and as the launch crosses over it, he orders the torpedoes readied. Just as the patrol boat clears the reef, one of the Japanese boat's shells hits its mark... and the launch is blown to smithereens. The captain orders the torpedoes to be fired, and the patrol boat is itself destroyed. The captain orders the mate to surface and look for survivors...without much hope.Catherine and the girls have piloted the dinghy out into the bay, and they are desperately looking through the wreckage of the launch for Walter. The motor has stalled, and Catherine is frantically trying to get it started again. One of the girls notices Walter's hat floating by, and Catherine sorrowfully reaches out to retrieve it. Suddenly Walter himself swims up to the boat, and they greet him joyously. At the last second, he'd been able to tie off the wheel and jump overboard. ""I'm sorry about our boat,"" Catherine says. ""Well, in a war, everybody loses something,"" he says, philosophically...""I'm just glad it was THAT Catherine."" She leans down to kiss him, and he tells her to wait just a moment, and let him get in the dinghy. He puts a leg up over the side, and the boat rocks ominously. The girls squeal, and Catherine protests that he's going to tip them in. ""No, no, no,"" he says, ""this will work...all of you get over to that side. Look, will you just do it MY way for once?""In the next scene, the little boat is upside down in the water. Walter, Catherine, and all the girls are sitting on top of it, soaking wet. They all look at Walter accusingly. ""Shut up,"" he says, morosely. The sub commander has been watching, and smiles. ""Looks like we're going to be taking on passengers after all,"" he tells the mate. As the sub approaches, Walter muses, ""I wonder if they serve coconut milk on submarines."""
A Shot in the Dark,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058586/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A clumsy, inept detective is hired to investigate the murder of a chauffeur at a country home.

Affairs: Monsieur Ballon and Maria, Maria and Miguel, Henri and Dudo, Madame Ballon and Henri, Pierre and Simone. Who killed who: Madame Ballon accidentally shot Miguel because she suspected her husband of having an affair with Maria and wanted to kill him. Madame LaFarge killed Georges because he threatened to break up with her. Simone killed Dudo to eliminate her because she was in the way of her affair with Pierre. Monsieur Ballon killed Henri because he was having an affair with his wife. Blackmailers: Georges blackmailing Monsieur Ballon (Seen leaving Maria's room). Maurice blackmailing Madame Ballon. (Seen leaving Maria's room).—Bert Weissensee Due to an error by Paris police captain Charles Dreyfus's deputy, disaster-magnet detective inspector Jacques Clouseau is assigned to the murder in politically influential industrial tycoon Benjamin Ballon's grand home on Sir's Spanish private limo drive Miguelr. Although foxy maid Maria Gambrelli is found in the room holding the murder weapon, Clouseau insists to search for another culprit and Ballon has political authorities revert Dreyfus's order to pull Clouseau from the case. While his investigation stumbles nowhere, but Maria works her siren charms on Clouseau into an affair, more Ballon-related murders occur, there and in a nudist club, with her repeatedly as obvious suspect. Later the body count speeds up around the by now couple, while Dreyfuss's frustration drives him into accidents, therapy and psychopathic hatred for Clouseau, who still discovers countless affairs at Ballon's involving staff and family.—KGF Vissers When rich M. Ballon's spanish driver is found shot dead, Inspector Jacques Clouseau is the first official on the scene. All evidence suggests Maria Gambrelli, the maid, to be the murderer. But Clouseau, being attracted to the beautiful girl, is convinced that she is hiding something. So, he has her released from jail and tries to follow her secretly. Things do not work out the way the inspector wanted and people keep being murdered, and each time innocent Maria seems to be the killer. But with someone important wanting Clouseau and nobody else to cover this case, his tolerance-challenged boss Charles Dreyfuss is close to losing his mind when casualties keep turning up. And Clouseau keeps on causing trouble without knowing it...—Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com> The famous French detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau, investigates the murder of a man at a country house. The owner of the house always seems to know more than he should, and although the evidence continually suggests that the maid Maria committed the crime, Clouseau always does the opposite expected of him, much to the disgruntlement of his superior, Dreyfus.—Graeme Roy <gsr@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk> Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is called to the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon (George Sanders) to investigate the murder of his chauffeur, Miguel Ostos. The chauffeur was having an affair with one of the maids, Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), and attacked her in her bedroom after she broke off with him. Miguel was shot and killed in her bedroom and Maria was found with the smoking gun in her hand, but claims no knowledge of how it got there as she maintains she was knocked unconscious. All evidence points to Maria as the killer, but Clouseau is convinced of her innocence because he has developed an immediate attraction to her. Realizing Clouseau has been inadvertently assigned to a high profile case, Commissioner Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) has him removed and personally takes charge of the investigation.Dejected, Clouseau returns home. He is awakened in the early hours of the morning by an apparent attempt on his life by a Chinese assassin. When the phone rings, the life or death struggle ceases and it becomes apparent that his assailant is his valet, Kato (Burt Kwouk), to whom Clouseau has given instructions to attack him when he least expects it to keep his senses sharp. The Inspector is reinstated to the Ballon case and immediately orders Maria Gambrelli's release from prison, as he is convinced she is shielding the real killer, who Clouseau suspects is Ballon himself.A series of additional murders of the Ballon staff follows. Each time the evidence points to Maria, who is continually arrested, only to have Clouseau release her again despite the growing number of murder charges laid at her feet. One of which involves, both Clouseau and Maria being arrested after fleeing from a nudist colony... without their clothes.Clouseau's actions embarrass the Sûreté in the press, but Commissioner Dreyfus is unable to remove him from the case because Ballon has exerted political influence to keep the unorthodox and seemingly incompetent detective assigned to the investigation. As Clouseau continues to bungle the case, Commissioner Dreyfus becomes increasingly unhinged and suffers a nervous breakdown that reduces him to a delusional psychotic. He stalks Clouseau in order to assassinate him, but accidentally kills a series of innocent bystanders instead and adds further notoriety to the case.When Clouseau confronts the Ballon household to unmask the murderer, it is revealed that Ballon, his wife (Tracy Reed), and three members of the staff are all guilty, as each of them has killed at least one earlier victim due to crimes of passion or subsequent blackmail attempts. Only Maria is innocent of any crime. As a massive row breaks out between employers and staff, the lights are cut (an arrangement Clouseau had made with his assistant), and the guilty take the opportunity to pile into Clouseau's car and escape. They are all killed when the car is destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by Commissioner Dreyfus. Having witnessed the explosion, and realizing that he has failed again to kill Clouseau, Dreyfus is reduced to an animalistic fury and is taken away. Clouseau and Maria celebrate the clearing of her name with a long and passionate kisswhich is swiftly interrupted by another sneak attack by Kato."

In Prohibition-era Chicago, the murder of mob boss Big Jim Stevens leaves a vacuum at the top. As the murder was orchestrated by Gisborne - one of Big Jim's underlings - with the assistance of Sheriff Glick and Deputy Sheriff Potts, who were also in Big Jim's back pocket, Gisborne plans to take over. However, Big Jim would have wanted Robbo, who he treated like a son, to take over. As such, a gangland war ensues, with Robbo having among his men an Indiana pool hustler named Little John, and Will, a sharp shooter. What happens between the two gangs is affected by Marian Stevens, Big Jim's beautiful and sophisticated daughter, who inherited her father's ambition and has more criminal smarts than her father.

The Night of the Iguana,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058404/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An ostracized Episcopal clergyman leads a busload of middle-aged Baptist women on a tour of the Mexican coast and comes to terms with the failure haunting his life. The Rev. T. Lawrence Shannon has been living in Mexico for two years, working as a tourist guide for a cut-rate travel agency. Shannon lost his church and was defrocked after taking liberties with one of his parishioners. He's now accompanying a group of middle-aged ladies from Texas whose leader, Judith Fellowes, is keeping a close eye on her teenage ward, Charlotte Goodall, who definitely has an interest in the former priest. After Charlotte and Shannon spend the night together, Fellowes is out to have him fired and to keep her from communicating with his employer, Shannon strands them at a remote hotel run by his good friend Maxine Faulk. It's the arrival of Hannah Jelkes and her elderly grandfather that has the greatest impact however. Her approach to life and love forces Shannon to deal with his demons and re-evaluate his life.—garykmcd When American minister Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon is expelled from his Virginia church, he travels to Mexico in search of his destiny and sanity. There he becomes a tour guide for a bus load of spinsters and a teenage nymphet named Charlotte Goodall, who is being chaperoned by the group's leader, the inflexible Judith Fellowes. Miss Fellowes, who is quite jealous of Charlotte's attentions to Shannon, discovers the young woman in his room and vows to have him fired. To thwart her plot, Shannon takes control of the bus from Hank, the bus driver, and speeds the tour group on a wild ride through the Mexican jungle to the crumbling, secluded hotel of an old friend, the recently widowed Maxine Falk. Eventually Shannon becomes enamored with another guest at the hotel, the rather genteel Hanna Jelkes, an itinerant quick sketch artist and her poet grandfather Nonno. As the wise Hanna partially restores Shannon's fractured world, Shannon struggles to get back the rest of his sanity and his self-respect.—alfiehitchie The defrocked Rev. Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon (Richard Burton) is to be the tour guide and historian for a church ladies' bus tour of Mexican religious historical sights. Even before boarding the old fashioned school bus, Shannon develops a contentious relationship with the lesbian leader of the women's group, Judith Fellowes (Grayson Hall) who is protective - read jealous - of the delinquent Charlottes (Lyon) interest in the reverend as her potential rescuer from being placed with the aged travelers. Driven to distraction by the attentions of the delinquent Lolita, Reverend Shannon has a alcoholic breakdown - as does the bus, right on cue - as they arrive nearby the Puerta Vallarta version of Bed & Breakfast establishment of the wildly over-the-top Maxine Faulk played by Gardner. Shortly after their arrival, the tour begins to heat up as the Reverend takes the bus's distributor thereby preventing the ladies' escape or the continuation of their tour. Shortly after the tour bus arrives, come an aging poet and his niece (Kerr). The heterosexual mirror to the appropriately named Fellowes, Hannah Jelkes proves to be less conservative than her spinster-like appearance indicates. Gardner's character has two native ""beach boys"" who chase down and chain up the titular Iguana so that it might be ""fattened up"" to be eaten up for dinner. All to the excitement and shock of the touring women. All the while Lyon is pursuing Shannon while as Jelkes and Faul pursue him as well and he pursues the bottle. Fellowes is either protecting Lyon's honor or hoping to convert her to lesbianism. An impromptu party develops and builds to a crescendo of death - Kerr's character's elderly poet uncle; jealous fighting - the beach boys and the bus driver, Lyon's character's other protector; and (verbally) Shannon and almost everyone else but the senile Miss Peebles - the author's tour ladies' personification. After sharing her secret sin with Shannon and the timely and sweet death of Miss Jelkes's poet just after finishing his last and lengthy poem, all the players find a weird peace. This acceptance that world must continue in its flawed manner and all must forgive, accept redemption and move on, arrives towards the end of the Night of the Iguana."
Sex and the Single Girl,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058580/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A womanizing reporter for a sleazy tabloid magazine impersonates his hen-pecked neighbor in order to get an expose on renowned psychologist Helen Gurley Brown. Using Helen Gurley Brown's book as a jump off point, we follow the adventures of a supermarket tabloid editor as he tries to parlay an interview with the author of the book into headlines and sales. Of course, a romantic entanglement ensues.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> Bob Weston is the top reporter for a sleazy, but highly profitable, tabloid magazine that owes its success to stories highlighting sex. Helen Gurley Brown is a bright and beautiful 23 year old psychologist who has authored the best-selling book ""Sex and the Single Girl."" Weston realizes that Brown won't grant him an interview because she has already been the subject of one of his exploitative articles, so he masquerades as his friend and neighbor Frank Broderick, a hosiery manufacturer henpecked by a jealous wife. After several counseling sessions as a patient with the attractive Dr. Brown complications arise when the womanizing writer starts to fall in love with the psychologist.—duke1029@aol.com Those at Stop Magazine pride themselves in how depraved their minds and thus their associated articles are. The more depraved the articles, the higher the readership. The head depravee is its managing editor, Bob Weston. Bob is most proud of a recent cover story they ran on ""Sex and the Single Girl"" author, twenty-three year old Dr.Helen Gurley Brown, the story questioning her own sexual experience or lack thereof. Helen prides herself on being both a noted academic and a doctor who gives practical, sage and useful advice for the single woman, and as such detests the story for what it's done to her reputation - and that of the institute for which she works - and her now dwindling patient base. Bob wants to do a follow-up article with information straight from her mouth, but knows that Dr. Brown obviously won't agree to the story or grant an interview. So Bob poses as a patient, specifically using his always bickering but in love neighbor Frank Broderick, a hosiery manufacturer, as a cover. The nature of Frank's arguments with his wife Sylvia Broderick stem from Sylvia's jealousy since Frank is always looking at other women's legs, which Frank counters is only a professional interest. As Helen's sessions progress with Bob posing as Frank, Helen starts to fall in love with him, and Bob starts to fall in love with her. As such, Bob may have second thoughts about doing the story, which may put him at odds with the Chief, his editor and publisher. Complications ensue when Helen wants to speak with Sylvia, who has no idea what Bob is doing. As Helen does manage to contact Sylvia, Bob tries to conjure up a fake Sylvia of his own. Throw in a couple of cabbies who are working on their own agendas and a highway patrolman who just can't seem to pick up any speed and the misunderstandings between Bob, Helen, Frank and Sylvia start to pile up, as do the traffic incidents.—Huggo"

Seven Days in May,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058576/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"United States military leaders plot to overthrow the President because he supports a nuclear disarmament treaty and they fear a Soviet sneak attack. An unpopular U.S. President manages to get a nuclear disarmament treaty through the Senate, but finds that the nation is turning against him. Jiggs Casey, a Marine Colonel, finds evidence that General Scott, the wildly popular head of the Joint Chiefs and certain Presidential Candidate in 2 years is not planning to wait. Casey goes to the president with the information and a web of intrigue begins with each side unsure of who can be trusted.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> At the height of the cold war, a weakened President and a popular four-star general face off in a battle for control of the US government. President Jordan Lyman has successfully negotiated an arms reduction treaty with the Soviet Union, but his measure is unpopular and does not sit well with General James Mattoon Scott, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has been quite vocal in his opposition. Marine Corps Col. Jiggs Casey, who works for Scott, comes to the conclusion that senior military officers are plotting a coup to overthrow the government. Working with a small circle of reliable and loyal officials, President Lyman tries to get the evidence of Scott's treachery and stop him.—garykmcd US President Jordan Lyman is a polarizing figure, with more opposing his actions than supporting them. The reason?: he signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. His detractors believe the Soviets will not live up to their end of the treaty and thus leave the US unprotected. They don't believe true peace can be an outcome of the Cold War. One of those detractors is Air Force General James Mattoon Scott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Scott is slowly ingratiating himself as a political figure - the face of US security - to raise the fervor of the peace naysayers. Marine Colonel Martin Casey - Jiggs to his friends - Director of the Joint Chiefs who works directly under Scott and who is loyal to him and his anti-treaty views, comes into a quick succession of seemingly innocent and not so innocent information - build up of a new military base in Texas dealing with Ecomcon which he previously knew nothing of, Scott secretly organizing $10 bets from other US military leaders on a horse race at the Preakness, anti-treaty Senator Frederick Prentice stating to him in private that they must all stay alert on Sunday, and Scott lying about his previous night's activities - which in combination makes him believe that Scott is leading a military coup against the president. Ecomcon seems to be shorthand for ""Emergency Communication Control"" and the taking of those $10 bets signifies support for the coup to happen in seven days on that upcoming Sunday during a covert military training exercise in the form of an all out alert about which Prentice should have known nothing. Jiggs brings his concerns to the President, who in turn cautiously takes the information with seriousness. With Jiggs, his chief aide Paul Girard, and his dearest friend, senior Senator Raymond Clark (who is better known as a dipsomaniac than an effective politician) among others, Lyman tries to amass evidence of the conspiracy, that evidence which includes dirt on Scott's private life from his former mistress, Ellie Holbrook, to be used only if all other avenues fail. They do learn that the conspiracy is true, but that it is so widespread - its scope including at least one in the media, political commentator Harold McPherson - that obtaining evidence is difficult. Without it, Lyman, as an unpopular president, will lose total effectiveness as a leader if he requests Scott's resignation. The race to Sunday begins as both sides try to protect their ideal of what's best for the country.—Huggo (Monday, 12 May) The United States is in a state very close to turmoil. Strikes threaten to shut down the entire coal industry--and on Pennsylvania Avenue (still open in front of the White House in the film setting), two opposing forces of demonstrators meet, first in stony silence, then with taunts shouted back and forth. One side carries signs offering thanks to President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) for signing a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. (""Peace On Earth Or No Earth At All"" says a double-wide banner.) The other carries bellicose signs denouncing Lyman and the treaty, and promoting the possible Presidential candidacy of a four-star Air Force general: James Mattoon Scott (Burt Lancaster), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Then a Scott fan swings his sign to cut the double-wide banner. Result: mélée, to which the Capitol Police respond at once with cruisers, motorcycles, and paddy wagons.Inside the White House, the President's physician (Malcolm Atterbury) notes that Lyman's blood pressure climbs by three millimeters of mercury for every letter he dictates. Aide Paul Girard (Martin Balsam) reluctantly shares with Lyman a Gallup Poll result showing that only 29 percent of the American people approve of the treaty. To the desperate pleas of the physician that he take two weeks off, Lyman says that he will take a swim in the White House swimming pool.Lyman asks Senator Raymond Clark, D-Ga. (Edmund O'Brien) to join him. Lyman has two things to tell Clark. One is his rationale for the treaty: that absent that treaty, the hair-trigger status quo would only get worse, and inevitably some hatred-crazed officer, on either side, might initiate a full nuclear strike, maybe with authorization, possibly without, and the resulting war would end in Pyrrhic victory. The other is some advice to Clark: lay off the sauce. Ray Clark is, quite simply, an alcoholic.Clark takes his leave of the President and returns to Capitol Hill and a meeting of the Senate Committee on the Armed Services. (Today such a meeting would take place in the Russell Senate Office Building.) General Scott is the key witness. He insists that the treaty is ""at best, an act of naïveté, and at worst an unsupportable negligence."" Senator Frederick Prentice, R-Calif. (Whit Bissell), the chairman, is inclined to sympathize and to throw softball questions at Scott. Clark ridicules the proceedings (""a bad Gilbert and Sullivan"") and frequently spars with his chairman and with Scott. Very clearly, Scott cannot persuade anyone who does not already agree with him.Scott does enjoy the almost unquestioning devotion of his senior administrative assistant, Colonel Martin ""Jiggs"" Casey, USMC (Kirk Douglas). As the two men make their way out of the Russell Building to Constitution Avenue for a drive back to the Pentagon, Scott instructs Casey that no one on Capitol Hill, or in the press, is to know about an alert planned for the upcoming Sunday (18 May). ""This one must be deep and dark,"" he says.Back at the Pentagon, Casey checks into the E-ring and goes to the office complex of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There he chats with a young officer in All-service Radio, Lt. (jg) Dorsey Grayson USN (Jack Mullaney). Grayson gives Casey some gossip: that General Scott has sent a message to ""nothing but the cream"", asking them to place their bets for the upcoming Preakness race. The recipients are: the commander of Vandenberg AFB; commander, SAC (Omaha, NE); ComSixthFleet (Gibraltar); Commander-in-chief, Pacific Theater; and commander, First Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC. The only man to send in a no-bet message: Vice-Admiral Farley C. Barnswell USN (John Houseman), ComSixthFleet.Casey goes on to his office, where he next meets Colonel William ""Mutt"" Henderson USA (Andrew Duggan), a member of the Army's Signal Corps. Henderson tells Casey that he is exec of EComCon, a secret unit based at a ""Site Y"" near El Paso, TX. Casey has never heard of EComCon, but draws Henderson out. Henderson reveals that his commanding officer is Colonel John Broderick USA (John Larkin), an officer that Casey has always regarded with suspicion of harboring neo-Nazi attitudes, particularly toward what an army ought to be. Henderson also reveals that EComCon has 100 officers and 3600 enlistees--and has been training more often for seizure than for prevention, as if the assets that EComCon is tasked to guard are already in enemy hands, and EComCon has to repossess them.General Scott's aide-de-camp, Colonel Murdock (Richard Anderson), interrupts the two by sending Henderson to another office. He then tells Casey that he should not discuss the alert with Henderson. Casey then, on a wild hunch, starts trying to draw out Murdock on Scott's Preakness pool. To his surprise, Murdock becomes terrifically angry and lets Casey know, in no uncertain terms, that he ought not to stick his nose into ""the General's personal business!"" As soon as Murdock leaves, Casey calls the Pentagon operator and asks whether she has a listing for EComCon. The answer: negative.That night, Casey goes to a party at the home of Stewart Dillard (Charles Watts). There he has a run-in with Girard, who protests Scott's belligerent appearance before SASC earlier that day. Senator Prentice butts in, taunts Girard over the treaty, then tries to goad Casey into talking out-of-school about what the military thinks of the treaty. This Casey will not do. Before things get seriously out-of-control, Dillard shows up and escorts Girard to meet ""the wife of the Indian Ambassador.""To Casey's immense relief, the next guest to speak to him has more pleasant things to say. This is Eleanor Holbrook (Ava Gardner), who until recently has been General Scott's squeeze. Now he has apparently dumped her, and she is trying to drown her sorrows in booze, a thing that Casey tries to put a stop to. Casey then agrees to see Ellie on a social basis.But before Casey can keep the nightcap date, Prentice, clearly not through, button-holes Casey and shoots his mouth off: ""We all have to stay on the alert, especially on Sunday."" Casey cannot let that rest. He apologizes profusely to Ellie, then sets out for Fort Myer, General Scott's headquarters. What to his wondering eyes should appear but Senator Prentice' automobile, parked outside of General Scott's official residence, and Senator Prentice getting out of his car and letting an orderly escort him into the residence--at 2345 hours.(Tuesday 13 May) The next morning, Casey reports to work, to review some footage from the last all-service alert, run in January. Scott is clearly not satisfied, saying that the military's response is way too slow. He then asks Casey to ""stay close"" and be available after the JCS meeting. Casey notices that Scott is tired, and asks Scott whether he got to bed late. Scott answers that he ""went to bed too early, slept from eight to eight, too much sleep. I may never wake up."" Clearly, that's a lie.After the meeting, Casey notes that the Chief of Staff of the Navy was not present at the meeting. He idly picks up a crumpled piece of paper from the desk of General Hardesty (Tyler McVey), Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The note reads: ""Airlift EComCon 40 K212s to Site Y before 0700 Sunday. Chi, New York, LA, Utah."" (The K-212 is a fictitious troop transport; no such aircraft exists on the military aircraft catalogue.) Scott tells Casey to keep secret the Preakness pool and Admiral Barnswell's refusal to participate. He then asks Casey to watch the broadcast from tonight's convention of the American Veterans' Order, which Scott will address.Grayson flags Casey on his way out, saying that he has just received a transfer to Pearl Harbor. He also reveals that Admiral Barnswell was indeed the only man to ""poop out on the General's racing form.""Casey does watch the AVO convention. Commentator Harold McPherson (Hugh Marlowe) introduces Scott, who addresses the meeting after the fashion of a politician, not a military officer. Casey has now seen enough. He calls the operator and asks for a connection to the White House.Casey goes to the White House and lays out everything before the President: EComCon (which, if it is a formal military abbreviation, could stand for Emergency Communications Control), its size, its ostensible mission, its probable mission (""training for seizure""), the Hardesty Note, the Preakness pool (and shipping Lt.-jg Grayson off to Hawaii when he revealed too much), Senator Prentice shooting his mouth off, Scott receiving Prentice late at night and then lying about how soon he went to bed that night, and finally that Congress is in recess, the Vice-President is on a goodwill tour of Italy, and the President has been asked to participate in the alert without the press. The upshot: General Scott is orchestrating a plot to take over the government. D-Day: Sunday, 18 May.Girard is not inclined to believe Casey. Girard also telephones Bill Condon at the Bureau of the Budget (after Casey leaves), and from him learns that no authority has ever appropriated funds for anything like EComCon. But the President will not discount the story. Hastily he assembles a task force, consisting of Girard, Supervisor Art Corwin (Bart Burns) of the Secret Service, Secretary of the Treasury Chris Todd (George Macready), Senator Raymond Clark, and Col. Jiggs Casey.(Wednesday 14 May) Chris Todd flatly does not believe in the plot, citing the absence of evidence for EComCon. Girard is inclined to agree with him. But the President cites the Navy being left out of the JCS meeting, the Hardesty Note, and what 3600 troops, aboard 40 K212 transports, could do. Art furthermore reveals Col. Broderick's Nazi-like attitudes, and Clark especially fears Scott's politician's manner.Finally, the President calls a halt to any further discussion. He lays out specific assignments. Chris Todd will coordinate at the White House. Art will recruit as many Secret Service agents as he needs to run tails on Generals Scott; Hardesty; Riley (William Challee), commandant of Marines; and Diefenbach (Robert Brubaker), chief of staff of the Army. Paul Girard will take a letter from the President to Gibraltar, confront Admiral Barnswell with it, and get his written reply. Ray Clark will go to El Paso, take a telephone number that Casey got from Col. Henderson, and ""find that base."" Casey will stay close to Scott and try to gather more information from him.Scott catches Casey looking up El Paso on the map. Whether Scott suspects Casey of compromising him, the film does not make clear--but Scott peremptorily gives Casey a seventy-two-hour leave.At Dulles Airport, Casey sees Clark off, but not before Clark instructs Casey to go see Ellie Holbrook, who might know more about Scott than anyone. As Casey prepares to leave with Art Corwin, they spot Harold MacPherson getting into a staff car belonging to Scott. The two men trail this car to a back alley, where apparently McPherson has met with Senator Prentice.(Thursday 15 May) President Lyman cancels all his appointments for the day. He also telephones Scott to tell him that he won't participate in the alert after all, but will go to his private island retreat on Blue Lake, Maine. (This is not the official Presidential retreat at Camp David; this is Jordan Lyman's private property.) Scott tells his secretary to hold his calls, while he calls Colonel Broderick at Site Y.Ray Clark makes it to El Paso an strikes up a conversation with a girl (Colette Jackson), who wonders why no soldiers have patronized the bar, though a base must be located nearby, as she and the bar owner see and hear planes flying in and out of a remote area at all hours. Clark gets into his automobile and drives down a desert road, and takes a turn-off. Then a helicopter drops out of the sky, and out steps a stone-faced guard, gun drawn, to arrest Clark.Paul Girard has made it to Gibraltar, and meets with Barnswell aboard his flagship (USS Kitty Hawk, CVAN 63). Barnswell breaks into a sweat, then agrees to write a detailed confession.Jiggs Casey goes to see Ellie Holbrook at her home. From her he gets a detailed and lurid story of her affair with Scott--in which Scott was so supremely sure of himself that he would write letters to her describing all the details of their relationship, none of which are safe for work. Casey then stuns and hurts Ellie by taking possession of the letters. Because he cannot tell her why he needs the letters, she assumes, incorrectly, that he came to collect them to spare Scott any embarrassment.(Friday 16 May) President Lyman screens some very damning footage shot from Blue Lake. Shown is a runabout reconnoitering the private island. In that runabout: Colonels Murdock and Broderick. That alone convinces Lyman, and Todd, that Scott and the others are indeed guilty.Todd heaps fulsome praise on Casey for securing Scott's lurid love letters. Casey makes no effort to hide his monumental distaste, and lets Todd know that he does not appreciate the inference. Lyman stops the nasty argument and assures Casey that, thanks to Paul Girard securing a written confession from Barnswell, he, Lyman, won't have to use the letters. But then Presidential secretary Esther Townsend (Helen Kleeb) brings in a dire message: Paul Girard is dead, killed in a crash of the airliner he was on. (The airline's name is ""Trans-Ocean Airlines,"" but is probably TWA, given the era of the film's release.)Ray Clark, now detained at Site Y, bellows into a telephone to Senator Prentice that he will demand several explanations from him the next time he sees him. Colonel Broderick, now back from his errand to Blue Lake, tells Clark that he's not going anywhere for awhile, and leaves him a bottle of booze. Clark pours this down a sink drain after reading a newspaper account of Girard's death.Henry Whitney (Fredd Wayne), an attaché at the US Embassy in Madrid, visits the crash site looking for the personal effects of Girard and the one other listed American passenger.Back on Site Y, late at night, Colonel Henderson visits Clark in his locked room. Clark then tells Henderson that when he, Henderson, first told Jiggs Casey about EComCon, Jiggs had never heard of it. Jiggs then looked up EComCon and found no reference to it in JCS orders. Henderson sits down to listen as Clark tells him ""the d____dest story you ever heard."" Whereupon Henderson decides to take Clark off the base. He tries to go non-violently, but when a sergeant detains him near the base flight line, and the alarm sounds, Henderson decks the sergeant, drives over the barrier berm, and escapes with Clark.(Saturday 17 May) Henderson and Clark arrive at Dulles Airport. But when Clark calls the White House to report in, someone takes Henderson away as if Henderson never existed. The President later confirms that someone has seen Henderson driven into Fort Myer and confined to the stockade--incommunicado.The President calls Barnswell to try to trick him into an incriminating statement. The savvy Barnswell denies ever signing anything or handing anything to Girard.Chris Todd urges the President to arrest Scott, Hardesty, Riley, and Diefenbach right now. Lyman will not do this without evidence. Ray Clark urges Lyman to use the Scott Letters, but Lyman won't make up his mind to do that, either.Then Scott's plan begins to unravel. Scott is rehearsing the communications cutouts at Mount Thunder, when an aide tells him that General Barney Rutkowski (Ferris Webster) has gotten his wind up after ten of the K212 transports crossed his radar and then flew under it. The aid is afraid that the by-the-book Rutkowski will go straight to the President with what he knows.That is exactly what Rutkowski does. ""Someone has a secret base near El Paso, and I should have been notified!"" says the angry Rutkowski. He then says that thirty more transports were due to fly in the same general direction by 0700 Sunday--only now they're due by 2300 that night. The President orders Rutkowski to ground any aircraft going anywhere near El Paso, or flying out of it.Now Lyman summons Scott to the White House. At a late-night meeting, with no witnesses, Lyman confronts Scott with everything he knows: EComCon, the detention of Senator Clark, the collusion between Senator Prentice and Colonel Broderick, the very selection of Broderick (considering his attitudes), Broderick's reconnaissance of Lyman's Blue Lake island, the arrest-without-charge of Colonel Henderson, and the Preakness code. Then the two men debate one another's moral position. Scott insists that he could be elected by acclimation whenever he asked. Lyman stands on the Constitution, elections, and the very real possibility that the Soviets would attack at once upon sensing that the United States was falling to a military dictator. In the end, Lyman demands Scott's resignation, and those of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach, and says that he will announce that demand in a press conference the following afternoon.Scott passes Casey on his way out and leaves without a word. Lyman then comes out of the Oval Office, hands the Scott Letters to Casey, and tells them to give them back to Ellie.(Sunday 18 May) Scott's plans have gone more than a trifle awry. Obviously, the EComCon Airlift did *not* take place as planned. So Scott plans to tape a delayed broadcast ""to take his case to the people."" Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach are highly dubious by this time, but Scott presses on.President Lyman begins his press conference, pre-empting the Preakness Race to do it. Then he delays it for half an hour, when Henry Whitney shows up--with the Barnswell statement, which Whitney did manage to recover from the wreckage of Paul Girard's doomed flight. (Girard had hidden it in a cigarette case that Lyman had given him as a special gift.) After ordering Whitney to keep the paper secret, Lyman has it copied out.Casey goes to the E-Ring to hand-deliver a copy of the Barnswell statement to Scott, together with Lyman's written demand for Scott's resignation. Scott accuses Casey of betraying him, and Casey accuses Scott of betraying his country and ""disgrac[ing] the four stars on his uniform.""Scott goes to a TV station to record his belligerent message. But before he can begin, a panicked Prentice and McPherson inform him that the President has a signed statement giving names and dates and implicating them all. Scott contemptuously dismisses the two men and returns to the E-Ring--where he overhears Lyman accepting the resignations of Hardesty, Riley and Diefenbach. Now utterly defeated, he gets back into his staff car and orders his driver to take him ""home.""Casey goes to see Ellie, who knows perfectly well why Casey took the Scott Letters. As he hands them back to her, she accepts Casey's word that the letters ""might have been"" ""the bullets"" to ""[shoot down]"" Scott, but weren't. The two agree to see each other again, after the excitement has died down.Lastly, Lyman declares that it is ""slander"" to suggest that the United States cannot be strong without directly waging war. He insists that world peace, and freedom, will come peaceably. With that, and a display of the Constitution, the film ends."
"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte",1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058213/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An aging, reclusive Southern belle plagued by a horrifying family secret descends into madness after the arrival of a lost relative. Aged, wealthy Charlotte Hollis has lived as a recluse in the crumbling family plantation mansion in Hollisport, Louisiana since her father Sam Hollis' death thirty-six years ago. The only people who regularly see her are her hard-as-nails but seemingly loyal housekeeper, Velma Crowther, and her longtime friend and physician, Dr. Drew Bayliss. She has lived there most of her life except for a short stint in London thirty-seven years ago following the vicious murder of her lover, John Mayhew, at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. She and John had planned to run off together that night, but instead he was bludgeoned to death. Nobody was ever convicted for his murder, but most people believe Charlotte did it. They also believe that Charlotte, whom they haven't seen in years, is a crazy old woman. Conversely, Charlotte has hidden away fearing that people would always be glaring at her. Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin Miriam Deering has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion. While Charlotte wanted Miriam to help her overturn the expropriation with the state government in Baton Rouge. By this time, Charlotte's mental state seemingly hits a sharp decline, perhaps because she would be leaving her family home, but could it be issues surrounding John's murder?—Huggo Charlotte Hollis is a semi-recluse, and widely believed to be insane. 37 years earlier her boyfriend, John, was brutally murdered. She was charged with his murder but her wealthy, influential father managed to have the case dismissed. She is still haunted by John, thinking she sees or hears him at times. With the state government about to demolish her house to build a road, and her resisting their attempts to get her to leave, her cousin Miriam visits for a few days. The idea is to help her but soon sinister, threatening events start occurring.—grantss Holed up in her eerily vacant ancestral mansion in hot and humid Louisiana, the embittered and reclusive Southern belle, Charlotte Hollis, is still living with the pale ghosts of the past, thirty-seven long years after the brutal murder of her clandestine beau, John. Now, balancing between guilt and innocence, sanity and insanity, Charlotte finds herself with the back to the wall when the Louisiana Highway Commission gives her an outrageous and equally uncompromising ultimatum: she is to leave her property to make way for the construction of a bridge or face the music. Perhaps, under those grave circumstances, the estranged Cousin Miriam can lend a helping hand. However, what good is having an enviable residence when one is steadily losing his grip on reality?—Nick Riganas Wealthy southern spinster Charlotte Hollis is shunned by her community for the grisly murder of her intended, John Mayhew, thirty-seven years previously. Although her guilt was never proven, the townspeople liken her to Lizzie Borden; the children even taunt her with cruel rhymes. This is why she lives secluded from society, her needs cared for by her faithful servant Velma. Now, progress in the guise of new highway construction threatens the Hollis plantation, Charlotte's family's domicile since Civil War times. She refuses to leave when the Sheriff issues her an eviction notice, even taking potshots at the highwaymen when they encroach upon her property line. Charlotte summons Cousin Miriam to fight the public battle to save her home.—<mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>"
The Train,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059825/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1944, a German colonel loads a train with French art treasures to send to Germany. The Resistance must stop it without damaging the cargo. As the Allied forces approach Paris in August 1944, German Colonel Von Waldheim is desperate to take all of France's greatest paintings to Germany. He manages to secure a train to transport the valuable art works even as the chaos of retreat descends upon them. The French resistance however wants to stop them from stealing their national treasures but have received orders from London that they are not to be destroyed. The station master, Labiche, is tasked with scheduling the train and making it all happen smoothly but he is also part of a dwindling group of resistance fighters tasked with preventing the theft. He and others stage an elaborate ruse to keep the train from ever leaving French territory.—garykmcd During WWII, the Nazis have stolen many works of art. In August, '44, days before French liberation, German Colonel Waldheim decides to bring back to Germany many works of art. He plans to transport the art via rail. Mlle. Villard, the curator of the gallery, asks the Resistance to stop von Waldheim, and soon, Labiche of the resistance, agrees to help, His elaborate plan has many obstacles to overcome in order to succeed, including von Waldheim.—Huggo Oberst von Waldheim wants to bring modern paintings, the ones the Nazis called ""degenerate"", out of Paris before the Allied Forces liberate Paris. He is able to persuade his bosses to give him the train. Labiche, a French railway official is asked by the management of the museum to stop this train, but he is not willing to risk the life of his people for art. But when his old friend Boule is shot by the Germans accusing him for sabotage on the engine he starts to work against the Germans, and tries to delay the departure of the train until the Allies are arriving.—Stephan Eichenberg <eichenbe@fak-cbg.tu-muenchen.de> Nazi Colonel Franz von Waldheim (Paul Scofield) and museum curator Mlle.Villard (Suzanne Flon) are admiring Impressionist and Modernist paintings in the Jeu de Paume, in Paris. She thanks him for protecting the art, but he announces that many of them are now going to be taken to Germany.Col. von Waldheim goes to the headquarters of General von Lubitz (Richard Munch), which is bustling with staff packing or destroying records and organizing the withdrawal from Paris. Von Lubitz considers the cargo ""degenerate art,"" but Col. von Waldheim succeeds in getting authorization for a train to transport the art by pointing out that the paintings are ""as negotiable as gold, and more valuable.""Railway Superintendent Paul Labiche (Burt Lancaster) meets in a river barge with Spinet (Paul Bonifas) to receive the latest instructions from London for the railwaymen working for the Resistance. His last two remaining compatriots are also there: Didont (Albert Rémy) and Pesquet (Charles Millot). Spinet tells them they are asked to delay departure of an armament train by ten minutes so that it will be caught in the saturation bombing of the yard at Vaires at 10:00 o'clock.Then he introduces another request. Mlle Villard wants the art train stopped. Labiche refuses to ""waste lives"" on such a project. Mlle Villard shocks even herself when she blurts out: ""But they wouldn't be wasted."" Didont is sorry they can't help her. He asks hopefully: ""Don't you have copies of them?""Short of locomotive engineers, Labiche reluctantly decides to assign his aged mentor Papa Boule (Michel Simon) to drive the train taking the art to Germany. In a café, Boule is disappointed not to be given something ""important."" When told what his cargo is, the art doesn't mean much to him, but he remembers fondly a girl he knew who was a model for Renoir. He muses about ""the glory of France,"" and asks for his change in franc pieces.The art train is waiting for darkness before departing, when Gen. von Lubitz calls Col. von Waldheim to rescind authorization. Von Waldheim tells him the train has already left, then orders the train under way immediately.In the yard at Vaires, Pesquet is driving the armoured locomotive for the armament train, and Labiche is supervising in the switch tower. They both create delays. Major Herren (Wolfgang Preiss), overseeing the operations, calls the switch tower in a fury. The camera zooms in on his wristwatch, which reads 10:00 o'clock, and the air raid siren starts.The railway yard is heavily bombed, and the armament train is destroyed. Labiche sees Papa Boule driving the art train through the conflagration. He signals him to stop, but Boule is determined to barrel on through in heroic fashion.The train stops at Rive-Reine. Boule has blocked an oil cup with a franc piece, and a main rod bearing has failed, so the engine must return to Vaires. There Maj. Herren finds the oily franc piece in Boule's pocket. Despite Labiche's promise to repair and deliver the engine himself, von Waldheim has Boule executed.Returning the locomotive to the train in daylight, Pesquet and Didont tell Labiche they want to stop the art train, because ""Papa Boule wanted it that way."" They are fired on by a lone Spitfire, and narrowly escape by racing into a tunnel. Shaken, Pesquet says this has to be his ""last job.""At Rive-Reine, von Waldheim commandeers Labiche to drive the art train, and sends him to the hotel to rest up until nightfall. Pesquet sets fire to a truck so Labiche can get to the station to make arrangements for sabotage at stations up the line. Since he has to kill a German sentry, he ties up Jacques the Stationmaster (Jacques Marin) so he can claim innocence. Still, Jacques is beaten until he gives a fake description of the supposed saboteur. Labiche gets back to the hotel just as the Germans arrive to look for him, but the hotel owner, a widow named Christine (Jeanne Moreau), convinces them he has been eating in her kitchen.That night, Labiche (with Didont as fireman) drives the train towards Germany. Each time they pass a station, officers riding in a coach at the tail end cross off the name on a map. At Metz there is apparent bomb damage, and the train is diverted south. At every succeeding station a fake sign is displayed. The train stops at Commercy, where the Germans telephone von Waldheim to reassure him that they have reached St. Avold, the last station before they cross into Germany. In fact, they have gone back west on another line, and are almost back at Rive-Reine.Jacques and an engineer create a derailment at Rive-Reine. Just outside the town, the art train passes a train waiting on a siding, which then begins following, driven by Pesquet. Labiche and Didont throw their German guard from the engine, uncouple from the train, open the throttle wide, and jump. Labiche is wounded in the leg. The locomotive speeds into the engine already derailed, creating a tangled mess. The rolling train crashes into the engines. Pesquet jumps from his engine, but he is shot running away. His train slams into the rear of the art train. Labiche takes refuge in Christine's cellar. Jacques (and others) are executed. Christine bemoans ""the cost.""Maj. Herren supervises the clean-up of the wreck. He and von Waldheim hear artillery in the distance: the Germans firing on the advancing Allies.Labiche and Didont meet with Spinet that night. Labiche is tired of waiting for the Allies, and is ready to ""blow it up,"" but Didont says they must save the train because of those who have already died for it. Spinet tells them that London wants the train to be marked so it won't be hit by bombers. They are to paint the roofs of the first three cars white. Jacques' nephew Robert (Christian Fuin) says he can organize it.Robert sets off the air raid siren at the station, and work lights are extinguished. Men scramble onto the train and spread paint. Robert is discovered and the lights turned on. Von Waldheim shoots him. The paint is discovered, and Didont is killed.In the morning, workers scraping the white paint are interrupted by an air raid. When the bombers pass harmlessly over the train, von Waldheim realizes the significance of the paint, and says, ""Leave it! Its my ticket to Germany."" He knows he can safely run the train in daylight.Up the line, Labiche plants an explosive charge under one rail. As the train approaches, he sees that von Waldheim has placed hostages on the locomotive. He is forced to blow the track well before the engine reaches it, giving the driver time to stop before only the first pilot wheel comes off the rail. Maj. Herren organizes the re-railing, and tells von Waldheim to send soldiers ahead to keep Labiche away from the tracks for the next few miles.Labiche struggles to get well ahead of the soldiers, and has just enough time to remove rail anchors and wedges along one rail length. Maj. Herren, riding the front of the engine, does not see the damage soon enough to stop the engine from coming off the rails. He tells von Waldheim it will now be impossible to continue.An army convoy passes by on the highway adjacent to the tracks. Von Waldheim steps into the road to stop the traffic, and orders the retreating soldiers to begin loading the paintings onto the trucks. The Major in charge of the convoy countermands von Waldheim's order, for the sake of his men. Maj. Herren convinces von Waldheim that they have lost. He and the others will join the convoy, but just before they leave, the sergeant signals a machine gunner to execute the hostages.Von Waldheim remains, alone. When the convoy has passed by, Labiche comes out of the bullrushes and finishes shutting down the engine. Then he sees the bodies of the hostages. He climbs off the engine, and is startled by von Waldheim, who claims such great art will always belong to people who can appreciate it. Labiche looks to the dead hostages and guns him down. As he walks away, the abandoned crates of art lie askew, juxtaposed with the crumpled bodies of the numerous dead."

Marnie,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058329/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Mark marries Marnie although she is a habitual thief and has serious psychological problems, and tries to help her confront and resolve them. Marnie Edgar is a habitual liar and a thief who gets jobs as a secretary and after a few months robs the firms in question, usually of several thousand dollars. When she gets a job at Rutland's, she also catches the eye of the handsome owner, Mark Rutland. He prevents her from stealing and running off, as is her usual pattern, but also forces her to marry him. Their honeymoon is a disaster and she cannot stand to have a man touch her, and on their return home, Mark has a private detective look into her past. When he has the details of what happened in her childhood to make her what she is, he arranges a confrontation with her mother realizing that reliving the terrible events that occurred in her childhood and bringing out those repressed memories is the only way to save her.—garykmcd In her own words, the beautiful Marnie Edgar is a cheat, a liar and a thief. Her M.O.: using one of a number of aliases each with a distinct social security number and a different look (generally entailing a different hair color and style), she gets an accounting type job at an office which will allow her access to the office safe, steals the money in the safe, then disappears without a trace. Much of that money goes to her Baltimore port area residing mother, Bernice Edgar, who doesn't ask from where the money comes and who seems to have an uneasy relationship with her daughter. The latest scam on which Marnie embarks, using the alias Mary Taylor, a widow, is at Philadelphia based Rutland and Co. What Marnie is unaware of is that company president Mark Rutland, a recent widower, who saw Marnie when she came in for her interview, suggested that she be hired despite she not being the most qualified candidate, solely because he recognized her as the beautiful Marion Holland, the former clerk at Strutt and Co. - a client of Rutland - who was hired there solely for her good looks, and who reportedly stole $10,000 from its office safe. Marnie does not recognize Mark. Mark wants to find out her story. He begins to do so after she manages to steal money out of the Rutland office safe. Mark did some research on her and she, who is between a rock and a hard place concerning this most recent theft, eventually fills in the rest of the details concerning her criminal activities. However, Mark doesn't send her to prison, but rather has a proposition for her which she can't refuse. This agreement with Mark ends up being her own kind of prison, from which she tries to escape. While Mark tries to understand why Marnie is the way that she is, which includes seemingly morbid fears of thunderstorms, saturated instances of the color red, and being touched by men, Mark's sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring, who seems to have aspirations to be the next Mrs. Mark Rutland, tries to find out what Marnie and Mark are hiding. If Lil is successful, Marnie's past could catch up with her and Mark and their arrangement.—Huggo Marnie Edgar is an ice-cold habitual thief. She uses her looks to gain the confidence of her employers, robs them, and changes her identity. Her only loves are her horse and her mother, although she has problems with the latter relationship. Marnie applies for a job at Mark Rutland's Philadelphia publishing company. Mark recognizes her since he is a client of her last employer, but instead of turning her in, he decides to watch her.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> The beautiful Marnie Edgar is a first-class bookkeeper and the apple of her employers' eyes. She also happens to be a compulsive thief who has taken her last employer, Sidney Strutt, to the cleaners before disappearing. With Mark Rutland, however, she attempts robbery once too often. He forces her to marry him, and out of love for her, uncovers the mysteries of her past that contribute to her penchant for taking other people's money.—filmfactsman The story opens as a woman with dark hair, seen only from behind, carries a suitcase along a train platform. The yellow purse tucked under her arm is presented at such an angle that it is suggestive of female genitalia.In the next scene, outraged business owner Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel) rants to a pair of detectives that he was ""cleaned out"" by a female employee named Marion Holland whom he obviously hired for her looks despite her lack of professional references. A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as ""the brunette with the legs.""The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost $10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that ""decent"" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland. Despite her now chestnut hair, he recognizes Marnie as the woman who stole from Strutt, but, excited by the thrill of chasing and capturing the attractive criminal, he hires her. Marnie robs Rutland, too, but he anticipated this outcome and manages to track Marnie down. Instead of handing her over to the police, he blackmails her into marrying him.On their honeymoon, which takes place aboard a cruise ship, Mark finds out about Marnie's frigidity. At first, he respects her wishes, but soon obsessed with controlling and dominating Marnie, he rapes her. The next morning, she tries to commit suicide by drowning herself in a pool aboard the ship, but Mark finds her in time to resuscitate her.In addition to Marnie's aversion to sex and generally troubled behavior, Mark's marriage faces a challenge from Lil (Diane Baker), the sister of his deceased first wife who clearly had designs on him and views Marnie as a rival she can overthrow. Upon learning that Mark has bought Strutt's silence by paying off the money Marnie stole, Lil invites Strutt to a party at the house. Strutt recognizes Marnie, the former ""Marion Holland"" who outfoxed and humiliated him, but grudgingly keeps quiet about her crime when Rutland threatens to take his business elsewhere and convince other clients to do the same.Meanwhile Marnie takes Forio out on their first fox hunt. As the hounds descend upon the fox in a snarling pack, Marnie sees the bright red jacket of one of the hunters; the combination of the violent scene and the color triggers Marnie's own fight-or-flight response. She charges away into the woods at a mad gallop. She loses control of Forio and can't rein him in when he heads for a high stone wall. The horse breaks both of his front legs against the wall and crashes to the other side in agony. Marnie is forced to shoot Forio to put the animal out of his misery, an act that ruptures her already fragile state of mind. Still armed with the gun she used to kill her horse, she heads for the Rutland safe. She's driven to repeat her usual modus operandi-- steal from Mark and run away, but by putting Marnie in a position where she already owns anything she might ordinarily be tempted to steal, Mark has frustrated her compulsive desires. Marnie breaks down in a welter of neurotic conflict.Mark attempts to discover the root of Marnie's compulsions, nightmares and odd phobias: of thunderstorms, of men and of the color red. He takes Marnie to her mother's house in Baltimore where he demands an explanation of the ""bad accident"" Bernice suffered. He knows from reading reports of the incident that Bernice made her living as a prostitute whose main clientele were the sailors that frequented Baltimore's shipyards. Marnie relives the night when she was six years old and one of her mother's clients (Bruce Dern) approached Marnie as she cowered on the sofa, frightened by a thunderstorm. Bernice reacted to the sight of the drunken sailor caressing her daughter by attacking him frantically. Seeing her mother struggling with the man, Marnie struck him on the head with a fireplace poker, killing him. The blood spouting from his head wound to drench his white uniform led to her fear of the color red.Bernice explains that she became pregnant with Marnie as a teen after she'd been lured into having sex by the promise of her date's basketball sweater, and tells her daughter that she claimed responsibility for the sailor's death and fought to keep the authorities from placing Marnie in a foster home because Marnie's the only thing she ever really loved.Relieved of the repressed traumatic memories that poisoned her subconscious, Marnie believes that she is capable of renouncing crime and sustaining an intimate relationship. She and Mark ride back to his family estate."

Intent on securing peace and prosperity throughout the mighty Roman Empire, the wise diplomat, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, calls together the local governors from all over the Empire, after conquering the Germanic tribes. With this in mind, Marcus has decided to turn over his crown and the much-coveted imperial throne to General Livius, instead of choosing his corrupt son and logical successor, Commodus. As a result, high treason and blind ambition lead to the death of Aurelius by poisoning, paving the way for a new era of oppression, endless machinations, and rapid decline.

Three disparate travelers, a disillusioned preacher, an unsuccessful prospector, and a larcenous, cynical con man, meet at a decrepit railroad station in the 1870s Southwest. The prospector and the preacher were witnesses at the singularly memorable rape and murder trial of the notorious Mexican outlaw Carasco. The bandit duped an aristocratic Southerner into believing he knew the location of a lost Aztec treasure. The greedy ""gentleman"" allows himself to be tied up while Carasco rapes his wife. These events lead to the stabbing of the husband and are related by the three eyewitnesses to the atrocity: the infamous bandit, the newlywed wife, and the dead man through an Indian shaman.

While the preacher and the con man wait for the train which does not usually stop here, the preacher and the prospector tell the con man the story of the murder trial with which they were just involved, a notorious womanizing Mexican bandit named Juan Carrasco who was charged with the murder of Colonel Wakefield of Tennessee as he and his wife were traveling through the area. The prospector and the preacher were subpoenaed to testify as the person who found Wakefield's stabbed dead body in the woods and the person who saw the happy couple on the road earlier in the day, respectively. What came out in the trial was the reason the preacher is leaving town for good, that testimony which he could not reconcile with his moral beliefs. Beyond the preacher and the prospector's testimony, the court heard the conflicting accounts of the three people who should know what happened as the three people on the scene at the time: the accused Juan Carrasco, Mrs. Wakefield, and through spiritual means Colonel Wakefield himself. Although there are similarities in their three stories including Carrasco gagging and tying the Colonel up to a tree in the process of robbing him, and Carrasco sexually violating Mrs. Wakefield, there are marked differences in the rest of the stories including who actually killed the Colonel.

British musicologist Frances Ferris (Joan Greenwood) and her late teen niece Nikky Ferris (Hayley Mills) are travelling through Crete recording Greek folk songs for the BBC. In the usually quiet coastal town of Aghios Georgios, they manage to get a room at an inn called ""The Moon-Spinners"", despite the people at the inn being busy preparing for a wedding, and no one there, except Alexis (Michael Davis), the young teen son of the proprietress Sophia (Irene Papas), he who is fond of spouting current popular Americanisms in his slightly broken English, seeming to want them there. Frances and Nikky learn from Alexis that the unwelcoming feeling is all because of his maternal Uncle Stratos (Eli Wallach), who has become a man suspicious of anyone ever since his recent return from London after being away for fifteen years. Beyond those there for the wedding, the only other guest at the inn is a young Englishman named Mark Camford (Peter McEnery), who they befriend. Nikky is too preoccupied with her own suspicions and mistrust of Stratos truly to see that there is something more sinister in the feelings between Stratos and Mark. Although they don't say anything to each other directly on the matter, Stratos knows why Mark is in Aghios Georgios and is always skin diving in the nearby Bay of Dolphins, and Mark knows that Stratos, and by association his other nephew Lambis (Paul Stassino), will be after him if he gets too close to what they have hidden in the bay before their intended method of disposal. By getting close to Mark, Nikky may unwittingly get caught up in what is the very dangerous and potentially life threatening game of cat-and-mouse between Stratos and Mark.—Huggo Start with a fortune in stolen jewels. Add a dash of danger. A pinch of romance. Season with Hitchcock-like intrigue and comic flair. What do you have? A mystery thriller for the whole family.

Young English girl Nikky Ferris (Hayley Mills) and her Aunt Frances (Joan Greenwood) arrive at ""The Moon-Spinners"", a hotel on Crete, to a less than enthusiastic welcome. The coolness of the owner is only out-done by the surliness of her brother Stratos (Eli Wallach), recently back from London. But then there is nice English lad Mark Camford (Peter McEnery) with whom to make friends, at least until Stratos and his pal take a shot at him one night. When Nikky helps him hide, she finds the Greeks are after her too.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Nicky Ferris and her aunt Frances are traveling on a bus to Crete. When they arrive at their hotel, the Moon Spinners, a village wedding is in progress. The proprietress, Sophia, did not receive the telegram Nicky sent to reserve a room.

But her brother Stratos is furious. Since his return from England he has been acting strangely. He does not want guests staying at the hotel but promises Sophia that soon they will have all the money they want. Sophia is very suspicious of his dealings with what she calls a strange Englishman.Nicky notices a young man in the crowd and learns he is also a guest. His name is Mark Camford and he is on holiday from England. He notices Stratos leaving and asks if he is going snorkeling in the Bay of Dolphins. This makes Stratos angry. Mark tells Nicky that he also likes to snorkel in the bay. They dance and enjoy the wedding festivities. Before saying goodnight, Mark asks Nicky to meet him the following day for a picnic.Instead of going to bed, Mark returns to the Bay of Dolphins to spy on Stratos, who is in a boat. He does not notice that he has been followed. A fight ensues and Mark is shot. He dives into the water and disappears. Stratos and the other man assume he has drowned. Later, Stratos goes to Mark's hotel room and takes all his belongings.The next morning, Nicky is puzzled when Mark doesn't show up for their picnic. Stratos tells her he checked out very early that morning. Not believing him, Nicky goes on a search. She finds Mark's shoe on the beach and traces him to a nearby church. He was shot in the arm but refuses to explain what is going on. Seeing that he needs medical treatment, Nicky covers him with her sweater and races back to the hotel, stopping first in Mark's room to bring him fresh clothing. But there is nothing there. She takes her aunt's traveling blanket and first aid kit, plus a bottle of brandy from the bar. Frances is listening to a group of native women singing and doesn't notice Nicky sneaking in and out.Once Mark is attended to, he orders Nicky to leave but he still won't explain why Stratos is after him. Back at the hotel, Frances reports the loss of her blanket and first aid kit. Stratos realizes that Nicky must have taken them for Mark, which means the young man is not dead after all. He encounters Nicky in the village and she tries to steer him away from the church. But he goes there, forcibly taking her with him, and finds her blood-stained sweater.As the day passes, Frances becomes worried when Nicky doesn't return.

Just then Mark turns up and they rescue her. But Stratos is not far behind and the pair set off for the next village to summon the police. On the way Mark tells Nicky his story. In London he worked at a bank but was fired after a client's jewels disappeared. He suspected Stratos, who fled the country soon after. Determined to clear his name, Mark followed him to Crete and the Bay of Dolphins. He is positive that the missing jewels are somewhere underwater.Sophia suspects that her brother is involved in Nicky's disappearance. Once again he threatens her and hints that something might happen to Alexis if she doesn't keep her mouth shut. Frances is frantic and Stratos makes a point of organizing a search party for Nicky.Stratos's friend catches up with Nicky and Mark. He is overpowered and knocked out, and now the pair have his shotgun. They decide to spend the night in some ruins. Stratos shows up but is spooked by the feral cats occupying the ruins. After a cursory search, he leaves.The next morning, Nicky and Mark are awakened by an elderly man who turns out to be John Gamble, the British counsel. His explanation for being there, to observe the ruins at daybreak, sounds rather fishy. But Mark's injury needs medical treatment, so they agree to accompany him to his home. His wife Cynthia is a nurse and will be able to help Mark. Gamble persuades them to leave the shotgun behind. By the time they reach the consulate, Nicky has told Gamble all about Stratos. Gamble assures them they will be safe there. He will send a car for Frances and arrange for them to be flown to a hospital in Athens.Cynthia takes them upstairs. Gamble goes into a room where Stratos is waiting. He is very angry at Stratos for bungling the operation and asks how he thought two British subjects could disappear without anyone noticing. Stratos mumbles a weak excuse but Gamble is through with him. He orders Stratos to return to the village and wait for further instructions.After a bath and some food, Nicky is feeling much better. Cynthia brings her a dress to wear until her aunt arrives with their luggage. But she fears Mark's injury will become infected. She gave him some medicine and he is sleeping. Nicky goes downstairs and by using Gamble's telescope, observes a yacht on the water. Gamble turns her attention to something else, obviously trying to distract her. When Nicky finally sees Mark, he is very suspicious of the Gambles. He tells Nicky that the jewels cannot be sold on the open market, so Stratos will try to find a private buyer. Madam Habib is a wealthy eccentric who travels on a luxurious yacht. She collects jewels and Stratos will likely approach her. Nicky thinks the yacht she saw might belong to Madam Habib, which turns out to be true.Mark believes that Cynthia has deliberately drugged him. He tries to get dressed but collapses. Frances arrives and Gamble sends them to the airport in a hearse, the only vehicle available because a street festival is going on. Frances is up front with the driver while Nicky and Mark are in the back. He is wearing street clothes under his pajamas and tells Nicky he is returning to the Bay of Dolphins. She follows him but can't keep up. He boards a bus and is gone.Nicky steals a boat and goes out to the yacht. She is taken on board and tells her story to Madam Habib, who is very suspicious of her. Meanwhile, Stratos and his accomplice retrieve the jewels from an underwater container in the Bay of Dolphins. They escape in their boat just as the police, accompanied by Mark, arrive.Madam Habib admits that she is expecting Stratos and forces Nicky to hide in a closet. Stratos arrives with the jewels, giving Madam Habib only a brief glance at them before demanding immediate payment. When she leaves to get the money, Nicky sneezes inside the closet. Stratos finds her and they struggle. Just then the police burst in and arrest Stratos. The jewels will be returned to their rightful owner and Mark's name is cleared."
Behold a Pale Horse,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057879/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Famous Spanish bandit Artiguez returns to his native Spanish village after 20 years in French exile, but Spanish cop Vinolas sets a trap for him. By 1964, it was possible for a major studio to make a film touching upon the Spanish Civil War without having to answer to some senate investigating committee or other. Based on Emeric Pressburger's novel A Mouse on Sunday, Behold a Pale Horse stars Gregory Peck as a Republican war veteran Manuel Artiguez who continues waging a one-man offensive 20 years after hostilities have officially ceased. Pressburger's novel was loosely based on the last raid of real-life anarchist guerrilla Antonio Sabate who was killed in an ambush in 1959.When the young son of an old comrade in arms comes to the French border village where Artiguez is exiled, he asks the old warrior to avenge the death of his father at the hands of vengeful Nationalist police captain Vinolas played by Anthony Quinn. At first Manuel refuses, but when Manuel learns that his aged mother Pilar (Mildred Dunnock) is dying he's determined to return to Spain to bid farewell to her. Pilar dies before Manuel can embark on his journey, but with the aid of traitorous smuggler Carlos (Raymond Pelligrin) Captain Vinolas keeps up the pretence that she still lives so that he can lure Manuel back to Spain and ambush him. Although a sympathetic priest (Omar Sharif) advises Manuel that he's being tricked, Manuel determines to return at all costs. Aware of the trap that's been set for him, Manuel engages the police in a fire fight, wounding Vinolas, killing Carlos and dying himself in the process.In 1966, Behold a Pale Horse was scheduled to be telecast on a major American network, but was cancelled at the last minute, reportedly at the behest of the Spanish government."

Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Premier and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that ""such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious"". Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world ?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com> U.S. President Merkin Muffley is on the hot line to Moscow with some rather embarrassing news for the Soviet premier: ""Hello, Dimitri....I'm fine....Now then, you know how we've always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the bomb....The bomb, Dimitri. The hydrogen bomb....Well, now, what happened is that, uh, one of our base commanders...he went a little funny in the head....and he went and did a silly thing....He ordered his planes to attack your country."" A comedy about an accidental nuclear attack? One that ends with total annihilation, thermonuclear apocalypse? Preposterous! Stanley Kubrick thought otherwise. In the end his thinking prevailed. The mad saga revolves around a psychotic Strategic Air Command officer, Gen. Jack D. Ripper, who lets loose his B-52 bomber squadron on the Soviet Union. Ripper takes this unilateral action because of his paranoid belief that Communists are sapping and contaminating ""all our precious bodily fluids"" as part of their plan to take over the world. Unbeknownst to Ripper, his attack will trigger the Russian's ultimate weapon, the Doomsday Machine, a diabolical retaliatory device set to blow up the planet.—alfiehitchie At the Burpelson U.S. Air Force Base somewhere in the continental USA, the eccentric Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders the 34 nuclear-armed B-52's of the 843rd Bomb Wing past their failsafe points where they normally hold awaiting possible orders to proceed and into Soviet airspace. He also tells the personnel on the base that the US and the USSR have entered into a ""shooting war"".In the ""War Room"" at The Pentagon, Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) about the attack that General Ripper ordered. Although a nuclear attack should require Presidential authority to be initiated, Ripper used ""Plan R"", an emergency war plan enabling a senior officer to launch a retaliation strike against the Soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command, including the President, has been killed during a sneak attack. Plan R was intended to discourage the Soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the President in Washington to disrupt U.S. command and control and stop an American nuclear counterattack. Turgidson tries to convince Muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Soviets as a threat by launching a full-scale attack. Turgidson believes that the United States is in a superior strategic position, and a first strike against the Soviet Union would destroy 90% of their missiles before they could retaliate, resulting in a victory for the U.S. with ""acceptable"" American casualties of ""no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops... depending on the breaks"". He is rebuked when Muffley instead admits the Soviet Ambassador (Peter Bull) to the War Room, contacts Soviet Premier Dmitri Kissoff on the hotline, and insists on giving the Soviets all the information necessary to shoot down the American planes before they can carry out their strikes.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (also played by Peter Sellers), an RAF exchange officer serving as General Ripper's executive officer, realizes that there has been no attack on the U.S. when he turns on a radio and hears pop music instead of Civil Defense alerts. When Mandrake reveals this to Ripper, and Ripper refuses to recall the wing, Mandrake announces that he will issue the recall on his own authority, but only Ripper knows the three-letter code necessary for recalling the bombers and locks the two of them in his office. Mandrake tries to convince Ripper to give up the three letter code. The psychotic Ripper refuses and rambles on that the Communists have a plan to ""sap and impurify"" the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people with fluoridated water, a theory that occurred to him during sexual intercourse, and which he believed to be the cause of his post-coital fatigue.Over the phone, an unseen and drunken Kissoff reveals to the Soviet Ambassador that their country has installed an active ""Doomsday Device"" which will automatically destroy all human and animal life on Earth if a nuclear attack were to hit the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Device is operated by a network of computers and has been conceived as the ultimate deterrent: as a safeguard, it cannot be deactivated, or it will set itself off, because its hardware and programs have been configured in such a way that an attempt at its deactivation would be recognized as sabotage. The doomsday weapon is described as based on ""cobalt-thorium-G"" [this was inspired by the real idea of a cobalt bomb, conceived by nuclear pioneer Leo Szilard, founder of Council for a Livable World]. According to the Soviet ambassador, life on Earth's surface will be extinct in ten months and was made as a low cost alternative to the bomb-race.The President now calls upon Dr. Strangelove (a.k.a. Merkwürdigeliebe), a former Nazi and strategy expert (Sellers in his third role). The wheelchair-bound Strangelove is a type of ""mad scientist"", whose eccentricities include a severe case of alien hand syndrome, so that his right hand, clad in an ominous black leather glove, occasionally attempts to strangle Strangelove or make the Nazi salute (no one in the room acts if this is unsusual). Strangelove also slips in addressing the President, as either ""Mein President"" or even ""Mein Führer"".Strangelove explains the principles behind the Doomsday Device, which he says is ""simple to understand... credible and convincing"". He also points out that a Doomsday Device kept secret has no value as a deterrent; the Soviet Ambassador admits that his government had installed it a few days before they were going to announce it publicly to the world, because Kissoff ""loves surprises"".U.S. Army paratroopers sent by the President arrive at Burpelson to arrest General Ripper. Because Ripper has warned his men that the enemy might attack disguised as American soldiers, the base's security forces, and Ripper himself with a .50 caliber M1919 Browning machine gun kept in his golf bag, open fire on them. After a fierce firefight the Army forces win the battle and gain access to the base, and Ripper, fearing torture to extract the recall code commits suicide. Colonel ""Bat"" Guano (Keenan Wynn) shoots his way into Ripper's office, but suspects that Mandrake, whose uniform he does not recognize, is leading a mutiny of ""deviated preverts"" and proceeds to arrest him. Mandrake convinces Guano that he has to call the President to tell him the recall code, which he has deduced from Ripper's desk blotter doodles to be based on the initials for the phrases peace on earth and purity of essence. Since office phone connections had been knocked out by the fighting at the base, Mandrake is forced to use a pay phone to try to contact the President. Not having the correct change to place a long-distance call to the Pentagon, Mandrake persuades Guano to shoot a Coca-Cola vending machine to get the change out of it, and eventually is able to forward the likely code combinations to Strategic Air Command.The correct recall code, ""OPE"", is issued to the planes, and those that have not been shot down return to base except for one. Its radio and fuel tanks were damaged by a Soviet anti-aircraft missile, with the result that the plane is neither able to receive the recall code nor to reach its primary or secondary target where, at the urging of the U.S. President, the Soviets have concentrated all available defenses. On the crew's own initiative, and losing fuel, the plane proceeds to fly at low level under radar to a closer target of opportunity.As they start their bomb run, the damaged B-52's bomb bay doors will not open, and aircraft commander Major T. J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) goes down to the bomb bay to open them himself. He succeeds just as the plane reaches its target, and one of the nuclear bombs falls, with Kong still sitting on it. He straddles the bomb and rides it to the ground like a rodeo cowboy, whooping and hollering and waving his cowboy hat. The bomb explodes, triggering the Doomsday Machine.Back in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends to the President that a select group of about 200,000 or more people be relocated into a deep mine shaft, where the nuclear fallout cannot reach them, so that the U.S. can be repopulated afterwards. Because of space limitations, Strangelove suggests a gender ratio of ""ten females to each male"", with the women selected for their sexual characteristics, and the men selected on the basis of their physical strength, intellectual capabilities, and importance in business and government. General Turgidson rants that the Soviets will likely create an even better bunker than the U.S., and argues that America ""must not allow a mine shaft gap"". Meanwhile, the Soviet Ambassador retreats to a corner of the War Room and starts taking pictures with a spy camera disguised as a pocket watch.A visibly excited Dr. Strangelove bolts out of his wheelchair, shouting ""Mein Führer, I can walk!"". Abruptly, the film ends with a barrage of nuclear explosions, accompanied by Vera Lynn's famous World War II song ""We'll Meet Again""."
Charulata,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057935/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The lonely wife of a newspaper editor falls in love with her visiting cousin-in-law, who shares her love for literature. Charu lives a lonely and idle life in 1870s India. Although her husband Bhupati devotes more time to his newspaper than to their marriage, he sees her loneliness and asks his brother-in-law,Umapada to keep her company. At the same time Bhupati's own cousin, Amal, a would-be writer comes home finishing his college education. However, after several months, Charu and Amal's feelings for each other move beyond literary friendship.—Erik Gregersen <erik@astro.asutexas.edu> Set in British India in the 19th century, the film revolves around Charulata, the beautiful wife of a learned Calcutta intellectual. She sits at home alone while her wealthy husband Bhupati runs his English language newspaper. Upon recognizing her profound loneliness, Bhupati invites his brother-in-law Umapada and wife Mandakini as house guests. Amal, his handsome younger cousin also comes for a visit following his graduation from college. Charu and Amal spend hours reminiscing over literature, poetry and the arts while Bhupati works on his paper. For a short time everyone is content. Then, a tragedy occurs. Umapada absconds with Bhupati's savings, leaving the entrepreneur in terrible debt. But the betrayed man soon realizes that something much more precious than his money is lost.—alfiehitchie and Arun K Barua In 1870s Calcutta, lonely Charulata, a bored, sad-eyed aesthete and frustrated wife of Bhupati, the wealthy newspaper editor of the weekly political newspaper, The Sentinel, feels trapped in a golden cage. Struggling with conflicting feelings, while trying to balance marital duties with literary aspirations, Charulata's world turns upside down when Bhupati's charming wastrel cousin, the would-be poet and author, Amal, comes to visit. Now, as both take an interest in each other's literary ambitions, a delicate but equally dangerous undercurrent of silent passion puts everything in jeopardy. Is there an escape from the pure magnetism of all-consuming desire?—Nick Riganas Charulata is an adaption to film of Tagore's novella ""Nastanirh"" (The Broken Nest).Calcutta, Bengal 1879.Starved for company, Charu embroiders a B for her husband Bhupati. Charu's days are spent by herself reading novels in their large house. She also watches passers-by through opera glasses from the upstairs windows. Bhupati on the other hand is a newspaper editor/owner, if not for that diversion he would be one of the idle rich. The newspaper is struggling financially, which keeps him continually busy, and neglectful of Charu.At a meal Bhupati informs Charu that her brother Umapada, an under-employed lawyer, has written to Bhupati about finding Umapada work in Calcutta. Bhupati has written back offering Umapada work at the newspaper to ease the load on Bhupati.That night, Bhupati is up late working, when Charu presents Bhupati with the embroidered handkerchief. Bhupati realises from the effort put into this gift that Charu has little to occupy herself and is lonely.Charu looks for another book to read: she finds ""Swarnalata"". Bhupati is amused at this choice. Calling Charu ""Charulata"" he tells her he will ask Umapada to bring Umapada's wife Mandakini to Calcutta as well, as a companion for Charu.(Mandakini seems to arrive first, Umapada only later, or this is a flaw in the scripting.)Mandakini and Charu play the card game snap, which bores Charu - who would rather be reading Swarnalata. After the card game finishes, Mandakini goes looking for tea. Charu is reading when a storm strikes Calcutta, just as Umapada arrives. The wind rushes through the house disturbing curtains, paperwork and the caged parrot.Bhupati takes the work-averse Umapada on a tour of the printing works in another part of the house. He shows Umapada the next issue of the paper The Sentinel, whose motto is ""Truth Survives"". He explains Umapada is to work as the new manager of The Sentinel, although whether the paper itself will survive as a business is unsure.The paper has a political focus. At the time (& like now), Britain was engaged in a war in Afghanistan, and Bhupati's editorial thrust is to be critical of the government policy. Indians have no say in the government policy as they have no political representation.Discussing the paper's future, or lack thereof, a divide open betweens Bhupati and Umapada over whether the paper should constrain itself to truth and integrity or liven things up for a wider market by introducing humour and scandal. Umapada favours making money at the expense of virtue. Bhupati attempts to reform Umapada's lack of enthusiasm for the ethos of The Sentinel by giving Umapada additional responsibility by way of the keys to the safe and control of the financial side of the business. Bhupati confides to Umapada that The Sentinel rivals Charu as the two most important things in his life.Next Bhupati's younger brother Amal, a 23 year old university student and fledgling author, arrives. While helping him to unpack, Charu suggests at his age Amal should get married. Mandakini brings a plateful of confections for Amal. Amal can tell Mandakini is interested and that Charu did not make the confections from the number of them on the plate. If they had been made by Charu, Mandakini would have brought fewer.
Amal begins to help Bhupati with the grammatical correction of newspaper articles. Amal and Bhupati discuss literature versus politics, their respective strengths. Then they arm wrestle against a piano lid. Bhupati, the older brother, wins. While he was away from Calcutta once, Charu was necessarily writing letters to Bhupati. From these letters Bhupati has recognised that Charu has a literary ability . He asks Amal to spend time with Charu so as to foster and guide whatever talent can be drawn out from Charu.Mandakini, Amal and Charu talk together about poetry, embroidery of slippers, snap, and women who lie on beds looking at themselves in the mirror. While Charu and Amal get into the merits of various Bengali authors and their female character creations, Mandakini falls asleep on the bed and starts snoring.Charu tells Amal to collect a mat with a peacock image on it, and with it they go out into the garden. The garden is untended and overgrown. There is a swing rigged from the branch of a tree. Charu gets Amal to push her, and he unwillingly does so. Charu starts singing about nature, youth, and cuckoos. With Amal by now flat on his back on the peacock mat, Charu starts asking him what he is thinking. Amal is thinking about writing.
Charu decides herself to make Amal a notebook for writing (with her own hands, Amal has previously bought a notebook from a store). She later gives this handmade decorated notebook to Amal on the condition that nothing he writes in the notebook can ever be published.There follows a montage of Amal writing various stories in the notebook. During one of these compositions, Charu is watching him from the swing through the opera glasses. But her view moves away to a window where a woman is holding a child in her arms. This sets Charu thinking.Charu gets Amal to read her out loud his latest composition. Mandakini is watching this from the house. Amal requests Charu's opinion on his work. Amal suggests Charu try writing something herself out of her own experience.Amal asks Mandakini her choice of which magazine he should try to get his essay published in. Mandakini is at a loss to answer, and while Amal goes to get ice cream for Mandakini, Charu walks past and scolds Mandakini for failing to bring in the washing.That night Bhupati lets Charu know that a very good proposal of marriage with Amal has been received from a family in Burdwan. This piques Charu who makes a barbed remark. Amal is resistant to the idea of this arranged marriage. But Bhupati reveals that whoever marries this daughter will be sent to England by the new father-in-law. Charu waits by the window as Amal and Bhupati discuss the attractions and opportunities of England.Eventually Amal decides to reject the offer. Charu laughs and claims she knows Amal will agree, given a few days to think about it.At night in bed, Umapada suborns Mandakini to prove her love of him by lying for him in regards to something he is planning.Another day, Amal is playing the piano while singing when Charu arrives with snacks for Amal, which Amal does not eat, but rather continues singing a love song, possibly mocking Charu. Charu's attention is caught by a pair of slippers on the floor, while a letter arrives for Amal. The letter brings news that Amal's essay has been accepted for publication. Charu is upset at this and locks herself in a room to quietly weep. Amal goes off for ice cream. She is still locked in when Bhupati arrives on the scene and he is in a quandary as to why the door is locked. Bhupati has come to see Charu because he is excited about the prospect of a change of government in England: Tories (Gladstone) versus Liberals (Disraeli). Amal returns with the ice cream and is also told the news by Bhupati. Charu now does not want the ice cream, nor does Mandakini, and Amal gives it to a cat. Amal argues with Charu that he was right to get his essay published. Charu verbally defers but inwardly rejects this contention.Charu is spurred by this to try to write a story of her own. She has trouble starting, until she comes up with a line beginning ""The cry of the cuckoo"", but changes ""cry"" to ""lament"". Thinks some more, then destroys the page. Numerous destroyed pages follow a trail across the ground in the garden. Sitting on the swing, Charu imagines boats on the river and dancing figures.A story results, which is published in Bishwabandhu. After Charu shows her name in print in the magazine to Amal, Charu throws out the pan prepared for Amal by Mandakini, and instead assumes for herself (from Mandakini) the task of making pan in future.Charu brings Amal pan she has prepared, along with a pair of embroidered slippers she has made, but Amal ignores the slippers and instead praises Charu's writing abilities. All this is however an emotional wrench for Charu. Charu tearfully blurts out she will never write anything again.When the liberals win the election and form a new government in England, Bhupati consequently wins a bet he placed on the outcome, and a party is held with the winnings. During this Bhupati gives a speech honouring Rammohan Roy. A musical soiree ensues. Musicians begin playing and singing. While the audience's attention is taken, Umapada leaves the room and makes his way to the office safe which he unlocks and then steals cash from inside it.Charu and Amal are in another room discussing whether he will go to England. And if so, then his eventual return to Bengal, and to Charu ?Umapada and Mandakini come to let Charu and Amal know they will be leaving the next day because they have received a telegram that Mandakini's father is sick. Umapada comes up with some money to repay that he had previously borrowed from Charu and gives it to her. Mandakini maintains fixed eye contact with Amal while she insists that Amal send her a copy of his magazine essay. Charu determines that Amal must now stay to manage The Sentinel in Umapada's stead, so long as The Sentinel survives.Back at the soiree it winds up with a complaint-come-celebration that the ignorant Bhupati has not been telling the other guests how his wife has become a published author on page 23 of the May issue of Bishwabondhu. He is carried around the room on the shoulders of stronger guests.At a paper supplier it emerges that 2700 rupees is owing (about 300 pounds at that time, 1879), money that Umapada allegedly paid to the merchant 3 months ago (but in fact did not pay). Bhupati discovers the embezzlement.That night something appears to be wrong as Bhupati has not come home. Charu and Amal are waiting for Bhupati, and Charu wants Amal to promise he will never leave, no matter what happens, or has happened. Amal will not make that promise.Amal locates Bhupati and learns The Sentinel is ruined. Bhupati expresses his difficulty at living with people when someone so close as his brother and friend Umapada can both betray him and show no appreciation.Bhupati finds Charu and remonstrates with her that he was so embarassed at the soiree because she had not told him about her story, and he only learnt about it from Nishikanta (another businessman). Charu explains she did not tell him because he was always busy. Bhupati informs Charu that he is getting rid of her rival (meaning the Sentinel) and he will not be busy any more.Meanwhile, in the changed circumstances, Amal also packs up to leave the house, but does not take the embroidered slippers with him.During an idle day at the beach, Bhupati wants to get Charu to write another story, as, unlike other stories, Charu's story in Bishwabondhu was the only one Bhupati could understand. Charu makes the counter-suggestion that if Bhupati starts another newspaper she will write for that. They reach an agreement that part of the paper will be politics in English, and part of the paper will be other things in Bengali. They form a plan to bring in Nishikanta as a third partner.A letter arrives letting Bhupati know friends have seen Amal in Madras. Bhupati gives Charu the letter with the news and exits the house. Outside the wind begins to howl. Charu collapses crying on a bed. Bhupati returns and discovers Charu in this condition. Bhupati only now comprehends what he has not been seeing. He leaves the house again, sitting by himself in a closed horse-drawn carriage as it drives around a darkening Calcutta.The film ends when Bhupati returns home to Charu that night."

Her kind mother, who runs an umbrella shop, won't hear of her marrying, particularly as Guy has yet to complete his compulsory military service. Genevieve is heartbroken when he leaves for his army service in colonial Algeria and is upset to have received only one letter from him in two months. Her mother's solution to this situation is kind diamond-merchant Roland Cassard, who has helped them in the past.—garykmcd Cherbourg, Normandy, 1957. In the pastel-coloured, rain-soaked coastal town, demure sixteen-year-old Geneviève, the daughter of the once-thriving umbrella boutique proprietress Madame Emery, finds herself at love's command. In other words, luminous Geneviève has eyes only for Guy, a handsome twenty-year-old auto mechanic. However, fate has other plans in store for the young couple. As Guy does his part for mother France in the Algerian War, sad-eyed Geneviève has to endure two long years of emotional hardship before she reunites with the love of her life. But some dreams never come true--sometimes, absence makes the heart grow cold. And then, Roland, a kind and sophisticated Parisian jeweller, walks into Madame Emery's shop, offering support and undying, unconditional love. Is this the prelude to a silent farewell between the star-crossed lovers?—Nick Riganas 16-year-old Geneviève lives with her widowed mother, who owns an umbrella shop in Cherbourg. She and Guy, a 20-year-old auto mechanic, are secretly in love and want to marry, but when she tells her mother, the woman objects: Geneviève is too young and Guy is not mature or well-established enough, particularly since he has not yet done his required military service. Shortly after this, Guy is drafted to serve in the war in Algeria. While Guy is away they drift apart, and Geneviève, strongly encouraged by her mother, accepts a marriage proposal from a well-to-do gem dealer named Roland Cassard, who has fallen in love with her.—M. Paul Shore Madame Emery and her daughter Geneviève (Deneuve) sell umbrellas at their little boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg in Normandy, France. Geneviève is in love with Guy (Castelnuovo), a handsome young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother Elise along with her quiet, dedicated, care-giver, Madeleine (Ellen Farner), a young woman who clearly loves Guy. Subsequently, though, Guy is drafted, and must leave to fight in the Algerian War.The night before he leaves, he and Geneviève make love. She becomes pregnant, and feels abandoned, as he does not write often. At her mother's insistence, she marries thirtyish Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), a quietly handsome Parisian jeweler who falls in love with Geneviève and is willing to wed her, even though she is carrying another man's child (Cassard had previously wooed the title character in Lola, only to be rejected once the father of her child returned; he relates an edited version of this story to Madame Emery with ill-concealed bitterness). The society wedding in a great cathedral shows Geneviève's upward social and economic movement, but she does not seem at all happy with her situation, and clearly feels trapped.When Guy returns with a leg injury, he learns that Geneviève has married and left Cherbourg, and that the umbrella store is gone. He attempts to ease back into his old life, but becomes rebellious due both to the war and to the loss of Geneviève. One day, Guy quits his job after an argument with his boss, and spends a night and a day drinking excessively in seedy port bars. He winds up sleeping with a prostitute named Jenny, whose real name turns out to be also Geneviève.When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him tearfully that his godmother has died. He sees that Madeleine loves him, and cleans up his life with her encouragement. With an inheritance from his aunt, he is able to finance to own a new ""American-style"" Esso gas station. He asks Madeleine to marry him, and she accepts, though she wonders if he is asking her from despair at Geneviève's actions.The coda is set in December 1963, approximately five years after the earliest events. Guy is now managing the couple's Esso station. He's with his now upbeat and loving wife Madeleine and their little son François. It is Christmas Eve. Madeleine and François go for a short walk, leaving Guy briefly, after which a new Mercedes pulls in to the station. The mink-clad driver turns out to be a sophisticated, visibly wealthy Geneviève, accompanied by her (and Guy's) daughter Françoise, who remains in the car.At first shocked to see each other, they go inside the station to talk, and Geneviève explains this is the first time she has returned to Cherbourg since her marriage. Her fairly young mother is now dead. Her rich husband and child are the only family she has left. She has evidently had no children by Cassard, and she makes no mention of him. The two converse while Geneviève's car is being filled with gas, and Geneviève asks Guy if he wants to meet their daughter. Without comment, and little reflection, he answers ""no"", and this leads to their exchanging their final goodbyes. As the film ends, Guy greets his wife with a kiss and plays with his son."

She smiles as she serves him food on a paper plate. He smiles back. She went to college; he's working on a train gang, working on railroad tracks. She asks if he's going back into the church service. 'No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. How 'bout you?' 'My father's the preacher.' He asks if she'd come out with him sometime. 'Maybe.' Back in the church, the pastor and the congregation are filled with 'the spirit.' Josie seems singularly detached. Duff observes silently from the doorway, then turns and walks into the night.Duff borrows a car from Riddick (Mel Stewart), a co-worker on the train gang. Against her family's wishes, Josie goes to a dance hall with Duff. After dancing, Duff and Josie return to their table. Duff is surprised that Josie has come dancing with him. 'You don't think very much of yourself,' Josie replies. Frankie and Jocko enter and asks to sit at their table. 'We were just leaving, fellas,' Duff replies, and leaves with Josie.Josie and Duff are sitting in Riddick's convertible, talking. It must be difficult working on the train gang, 'you're kinda cut off.' He says its fine with him. 'I don't get along so well most places.' He says she's got a lovely face. She allows him to kiss her.A young white man appears on Josie's side of the car. Another one whom we don't see asks if they are doing anything. The first one says no. The second one appears, also on Josie's side. They both appear to be barely out of their teens. Duff tells them quietly, 'Get out of here.' Josie tells him, 'Don't.' 'Don't start no trouble, boy,' one boy replies. One shines a flashlight in their faces, then traces the beam from Josie's face to her breasts. He notices Josie is the preacher's daughter, and realizes there'll be trouble. They leave. Duff pockets a knife.Duff drives Josie home. He asks her why she stays in this town. The kids need a good teacher. She says things used to be worse .Eight years ago, white men tied a black man to a car and dragged him to death. Her father knew who did it, but didn't say anything. 'Scared, huh?' They arrive at Josie's house. She would like to see him again. He asks why. She isn't going to 'hit the hay', and he isn't going to get married. She tells him that when they met the other night, she felt he was different from other men... she would like to see him again.Duff meets Josie after class, and they talk side by side on a swing in the schoolyard. When he takes her home, there is a white man with her father, Reverend Dawson (Stanley Greene), in the living room. Mr. Johnson (Eugene Wood), the superintendent of schools, is just leaving. He greets Duff cordially, and then turns to the Reverend. 'I'm counting on you, Reverend... Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.' 'I know,' the Reverend replies. After Johnson leaves, the Reverend invites Duff to sit down. They'll be getting a new school. Duff asks, why can't all of the kids go to the same school? We've got to go easy, the Reverend replies. We haven't had any trouble in this town for the past eight years, and we aren't going to have any now. He asks Duff if he is a churchman. Duff replies that he isn't. But, it 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.' The reverend replies that it seems like there isn't much they have to say to each other. He gets to his feet. 'My wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.'Duff leaves. Josie catches up with him on the porch. She apologies for her father, and says she's free tomorrow. He's going to Birmingham tomorrow to see his kid, he replies. 'I didn't know you had one...are you married?' 'No, I ain't married,' he says, and leaves.Duff boards the bus to Birmingham. He makes his way to the back, and Josie is waiting for him, an empty seat next to her. She smiles at him. 'I'm just going to do my shopping.' She slides over so he can sit next to her.Duff is in a Black section of Birmingham, AL. He finds his address. The door opens and Effie Sims (Helen Lounck) is holding an infant. When Duff introduces himself, she replies: 'Bout time you showed...James Lee, come and meet your Daddy.' His son's mother, Wilma, has gone to Detroit, she says. She's got herself a husband now. Regarding James Lee she says, 'They don' want him 'round. And I tell you...I got no use for him neither.' Duff says he's been sending Wilma money; Effie hasn't received any, and Duff had better find a place for the boy real quick. She leads him to another room. James Lee, about four years old, is with two other infants, and doesn't acknowledge his father. Duff gives him a toy and returns to the outer room. He hands Effie some cash. He'll be sending her the money from now on.Still in Birmingham, Duff visits his father, Will (Julius Harris), who is lounging in a bed. Duff has to introduce himself. Will offers him a drink. He's waiting on some insurance money, then he's got plans. His partner, Lee (Gloria Foster), enters. I wouldn't have made it without Lee, Will says. The three go to a bar for a celebration. Will asks Duff if he's got a woman, advises him not to get married. They'll take all your dough. Duff and Lee dance. Lee tells him of Will's problems. After the dance Will asks Duff what did he 'come bother me for?' Lee replies, He's your son. Will tells Duff to beat it. 'I get the point,' says Duff. He drops some cash on the bar counter and leaves.Later that night Duff and Josie meet in the bus depot. Duff's been thinking. About getting married. He presses her. She warns him not to 'push' her. But then says yes. Later, back in the bunk car, he tells the guys in the train gang the news. Frankie and Jocko think he's out of his mind. He'll have to quit his job on the railroad, and settle for $20 a week, if he's lucky, compared to the $80 he's making on the railroad.Josie and Duff check out an abandoned house. 'It'll be okay when were done with it,' Josie says. Across the yard are their neighbors, Barney and Bessie (Alfred Puryear, Jary Banks) with their children. Barney works at the mill, Josie says.At Duff's and Josie's wedding, Josie's father is officiating. Only Duff and Josie are smiling.Duff gets a job at the mill. The white foreman notices Duff working. 'Hey, Jack!...Hey, boy!...I'm talkin' to you.' 'The name's Duff.' The foreman compliments him on his work, notices that Duff doesn't say much.A white mill hand is having lunch with the black men. Josie's the best looking colored girl in town, he says. He helps himself to a piece of Barney's pie. Barney's wife can cook too. Barney's doing his best work at home. No wonder he's dragging his tail on the job. No one laughs. The white mill hand addresses Duff. 'What's the matter, boy? Never smile?' 'I smile when it's funny.' The mill hand says he thought it was funny. Asks the black workers if they thought it was funny. They all agree it was. He turns to Duff. You ain't got a sense of humor. You ought to smile more. He leaves. The black mill hands warn him. 'Yeah, you want to get along, act the nigger.' Like hell, Duff says.' if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.' Joe (Charles McRea), who's been silent until now, gets to his feet. 'Man, you sound like a trouble man.'Duff's friends from the train gang are invited to dinner with Duff and Josie. Duff shares his experience at the mill, and how frightened his fellow black mill-workers are for speaking up, or talking back. They've all got families to support, says Jocko. Josie changes the subject and asks the men if they'll continue working on the railroad. Frankie says, no, they'll be shipped all 'over the map.'The men leave. Josie and Duff are getting ready for bed. Josie tells him she's pregnant.In the locker room at the mill, a white supervisor pulls Duff aside. 'I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!' Duff says he doesn't know what he's talking about. 'That's no way to talk, boy.' He asks Duff if he's a union man. Duff replies that he was, when he worked on the railroad. The supervisor asks 'Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?' Duff looks at his fellow mill-workers, who avoid his eyes. The supervisor adds: 'All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.' Duff says nothing. 'Want to keep your job, boy?' Duff looks at the supervisor in silence, then turns and opens his locker. 'Boy, you're actin' like a nigger with no sense. All right, go down' to the office and get your pay. Tell them you're through.'Duff tells Josie he's been fired. She tells him he'll find another job. He applies at another mill yard. 'Yeah, we can use you,' says the hiring boss, a white man. He checks Duff's application. He asks where he's worked before and what his name is. Duff tells him. The hiring boss checks a file folder, 'Sorry, boy, there ain't nothin' here.'Duff is sitting at a lunch counter at a restaurant. Joe, one of the mill hand co-workers sits down beside him. He says, there was just one guy who talked; they should have acted different...they've never seen anyone stand up before, took them by surprise.Duff looks for another job, but he refuses the jobs that are available, picking cotton at three dollars a day, being a bellhop at ten dollars a week plus tips and lunch. Not for him, says Duff. At a grocery store, the manager says, he's already 'got a boy, thanks.' Duff has to borrow money from Josie to fix his car. Desperate, Duff boards a truck to pick cotton. They'll get $2:50 a day, not the usual $3, cause there won't be much of a crop this year. Duff turns and leaves.One night Josie is sewing on the porch. Duff is a few feet away, fixing a chair. Josie says they have enough money, and she can work, even after the baby comes. 'What the hell could you do?' 'Day work.' 'You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.' He jumps up and smashes the chair. She's clearly upset. 'I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it,' she says. Stop being so damn understanding, Duff says.Josie's father is in Duff's and Josie's living room. He knows how Duff feels, he assures him. But you're going about it the wrong way. Make 'em think you're going along and get what you want. 'It ain't in me,' Duff replies. 'How do you intend to support your family,' the Reverend asks. He feels sorry for Josie. He knew it wouldn't work out. 'Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger,' Duff says, and moves inches to the Rev's face. 'You've been stoopin' so long Rev, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You're just half a man.' In the kitchen, Josie overhears the conversation and accidentally cuts her hand on a piece of glass. She cries silently. Rev. Dawson says he'll ask a friend at a gas station if there's any work available there. He leaves.In their bedroom, Duff asks Josie why doesn't she hate the white folks? She's not afraid of them, she says. They can't touch me on the inside. 'The hell they can't. They can reach right in and turn you on and off.' 'Not if you see them for what they are.'Duff gets a job at the gas station. One night, he is called out to tow a vehicle that hit a tree on a deserted back road. As he's jacking the car up, it slips. The white motorist yells at Duff, harangues him relentlessly: Don't do her no good to get banged like that. Duff replies, don't do her no good to go into a tree. 'What'd you say, boy?' 'I said she was in great shape.'Duff is at work back at the filling station. A car speeds up and screeches to a halt. There are four white men in it. The motorist who was stranded is in the back seat. They specifically ask for Duff, and they want exactly thirty-eight cents worth of gas. Better not make it thirty-nine. And we got business with you. You going to apologize to our friend here. They goad him into apologizing. 'That'll be thirty-eight cents,' Duff says. They fantasize about having their way with Josie. Duff tells them to get out of there. The driver threatens Duff--there'll be some dying around here. Duff threatens them right back. The gas station owner suddenly appears. The driver tells him to get rid of Duff, or this place won't be around-and he ain't kiddin'. Duff is fired.Back at home, a pregnant Josie says she called the gas station. She was worried. She loves him. He shoves her violently clear across the room. 'I never should have married you in the first place.' He leaves Josie on the floor, crying. Later, Josie is in bed. Duff is packing. 'You'll be better off without me. I'm not fit to live with no more.' He picks up his suitcase, promises to write, and leaves.Duff visits his father in Birmingham. Will is sweating, drunk, disoriented. Hel touches the back of his head, 'Got a thick feeling' here.' Duff and Lee take him downstairs and bundle him into the back of Duff's car, to take him to the hospital. Will is in the back seat, his face in Lee's lap. On the way, Lee says calmly. 'Duff, he's stopped breathing.'At the funeral parlor, the undertaker prepares for the funeral. He asks Duff basic questions about his father. Where was he born? His profession? Duff doesn't know. How old was he? Forty-eight, I guess.On the way back from the cemetery, Lee invites Duff to stay with her, until he can get back on his feet. He declines. What're you gonna do, she asks. He's going to back to the town, make more trouble. As Duff leaves, Lee defends Will: 'Don't be too hard on him.' 'Hell, I'm just like him.'Duff gets his son, James Lee, and puts him in the front seat of his car. He drives him back home, lays him down on the couch. Josie smiles at James Lee and says 'Hi.' She goes to Duff, falls into his arms, and places her head on his chest. Crying, she holds him tight, and he embraces her just as tightly. 'It ain't gonna be easy, baby,' he says, 'but it's gonna be alright...Baby I feel so free inside.'"
36 Hours,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057809/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Germans kidnap an American Major and try to convince him that World War II is over so they can get details about the Allied invasion of Europe out of him. In this psychological war-drama an Army Major is captured by the Germans during World War II. They attempt to brainwash him into believing that the war is over and that he is safe in an Allied hospital, so that he will divulge Allied invasion plans.—Patrick Dominick <p-dominick@adfa.oz.au> Just days prior to the launch of D-Day in June 1944, the Nazis kidnap Maj. Jefferson Pike in Lisbon and transport him to Germany. They have established an elaborate ruse to convince him that it is 1950 and that the war is long over. They have built a replica of an American hospital, staffed it with English-speaking personnel and tell Pike he has been suffering from periodic loss of memory since the war's end. They really want to learn where the Allies will launch their assault on Fortress Europe: the Pas de Calais or Normandy? He is initially taken in and gives away the plans for the Normandy invasion. Once he realizes what is happening, he not only has to convince them he was lying the first time around but find a way to escape.—garykmcd On April 15, 1944, Allied powers met to discuss plans to invade the European continent. On June 1st, 1944, London-based U.S. intelligence officer Major Jeff Pike, who was at that April meeting, is tasked with contacting his regular sources in Lisbon to discover if the Nazis are aware of the plan to land at Normandy, or if they are still expecting what would be the more logical route to land at Calais, the imminent actual invasion planned for the 5th dependent on what Jeff is able to discover. The Nazis have their own plan for Major Pike when he lands in Portugal. Led by Major Dr. Walter Gerber who has conducted 17 similar and all successful intelligence operations albeit on lesser ranking military personnel with less pertinent information, the Nazis, in an elaborate ruse, are going to abduct Pike in Lisbon and have him willingly provide information on the invasion by tricking him in believing that he is recuperating from war sustained injuries, including amnesia, at a U.S. military hospital in Germany--in 1950, the Allied-won war long over. Beyond Gerber as Jeff's doctor, one other key person in the ruse is Anna Hedler, who is to act as his primary nurse as well as his love interest in the hopes that he will open up to her. Not all is copacetic within the Nazi ranks as Gerber discovers just before Pike is to awaken in 1950 from his drug-induced slumber, that he only has thirty-six hours to gather whatever information he can before the SS, skeptical of Gerber's methods, takes over to employ their more traditional interrogation methods on Pike, the SS, and Gerber, who may thus be working at cross purposes from each other. What may be a factor into what happens is Hedler, who has her own motivations the result of her heavily-scarred war history.—Huggo An introductory WWII newsreel sets the stage. D-Day is fast approaching, but the exact date and designated invasion beaches are closely-held secrets. The British Isles are bulging with troops, ships and equipment.The story begins in London on May 31, 1944. An American army major, Jefferson Pike (James Garner), enters Allied Forces HQ to discuss the ongoing invasion preparations. The top brass aren't convinced that Allied deception efforts have fooled the Germans. While poring over a wall map of German troop dispositions in France, Pike inadvertently slides his finger along the edge of the map, incurring a nasty paper cut.To hedge their bets, the High Command sends Pike to Lisbon to meet with a German double agent and see what he knows. Pike expresses concerns that if captured and tortured, he might reveal exact invasion details. His superiors feel that the risk is justified. As Pike flies out of London in civilian garb, a German spy sees him boarding the plane and reports it to her handlers. Another German spy enters his vacant hotel room and gathers personal items, including photos, letters and hair samples from his brush.In Lisbon, Pike goes to a nightclub to meet his contact but quickly realizes that his drink has been drugged shortly before he passes out. He is soon in German hands, placed in a coffin as a deceased German embassy clerk, and flown to Germany. An American-born German army major, Walter Gerber (Rod Taylor), is a military psychiatrist in charge of an elaborate deception scheme designed to coax the invasion secrets from Major Pike. An entire ""American"" military convalescent center has been set up deep in a German forest to fool Pike. Major Gerber is given 36 hours to extract the invasion plans from Pike. After that, Pike will be handed over to the SS to gain the information through their usual means. Gerber also understands that the consequences of failure will be catastrophic for his own future.When a groggy, disoriented Pike finally awakens, he is relieved to find himself in Allied hands. Looking in a mirror for the first time, he is shocked to find his dark hair streaked with gray, his skin aged, and his vision blurry. His every move is observed through a two-way mirror. Piece by piece, Pike is sold the idea that it is now May 1950, the war is long over, and he is convalescing at an American military hospital in occupied Germany. Both Major Gerber and pretty nurse Anna Hedler (Eva Marie Saint) are leading actors in the ruse. Pike's room contains familiar photos and Anna is able to provide accurate details about his parents. Rigorous measures are taken to ensure that Pike is surrounded by dozens of role players who are fluent in American speech dialects and customs. No one is allowed to speak German, even out of Pike's hearing. Pike is told that he is suffering from severe amnesia, a side effect from the severe ""beating"" he supposedly absorbed after the Lisbon incident six years earlier. According to the cover story, Pike was found wandering alone in Lisbon and sent back to the US to recuperate, but continual regressions over the years dictated that he be sent to Major Gerber in Germany for experimental psychological therapy.His nurse tells him that she and Pike have been married for two months, but due to another regression he doesn't remember her. In an unguarded moment with Anna, Pike asks about the war's closing months and mentions something about the invasion sites having been in Normandy. She tries to conceal her shock and reports the sensational disclosure to Major Gerber, who then manages to skillfully extract the most important invasion details from the trusting Pike. The race is on. The date is now June 2.After the session with Gerber, Pike is absent-mindedly rubbing his fingers together when he suddenly irritates the painful paper cut incurred in London two days earlier. Gradually recalling the injury, confusion registers on his face. With his suspicions aroused, Pike takes steps to confirm his worst fears and then violently confronts Anna, who admits to the elaborate plot. She explains that she went along with the ruse in order to buy her way out of a concentration camp. Out of hatred for her captors, she agrees to help Pike. He tells her to run out of his room screaming that he has escaped and that he has known about the plot from the outset. Pike slips out the back way, knowing that he will be caught. Now the Germans must determine whether Pike was telling the truth about Normandy or trying to deceive them.A disappointed Major Gerber asks how and when Pike figured out the scheme and Pike tells him about the paper cut. Gerber explains that Pike was carefully examined for injuries when he arrived, but the cut was obviously concealed in a skin crease. Gerber still thinks Normandy was a truthful answer, but he knows no one will believe him. The SS indeed discounts Pike's accurate story and allows the bulk of the German forces to remain idled near Calais. Gerber explains regretfully that Pike will now be handed over to the tender mercies of the SS.Hating the SS and realizing that he will probably be executed for his costly failure, Major Gerber settles on a daring plan to have his pioneering research on psychological combat trauma live on. He gives his research papers to Pike and Anna, advises them how to get across the border, and helps them escape from their locked room.The race for freedom is now on, with a zealous SS officer trying to capture the pair before they can escape over the Swiss border."
The Masque of the Red Death,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058333/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A European prince terrorizes the local peasantry while using his castle as a refuge against the ""Red Death"" plague that stalks the land. The evil Prince Prospero is riding through the Catania village when he sees that the peasants are dying of Red Death plague. Prospero asks to burn down the village and he is offended by the villagers Gino and his father-in-law Ludovico. He decides to kill them, but Gino's wife, the young and beautiful Francesca, begs for the lives of her husband and her father and Prospero brings them alive to his castle expecting to corrupt Francesca. Propero worships Satan and invites his noble friends to stay in his castle that is a shelter of depravity against the plague. When Prospero invites his guests to attend a masked ball, he sees a red hooded stranger and he believes that Satan himself has attended his party. But soon he learns who his mysterious guest is.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil While a plague - the Red Death - ravages the countryside, Prince Prospero offers refuge in his castle to the local nobility. He's also taken into his castle a young woman, Francesca, from the local village where the plague began. While the aristocracy play their silly games, Propero introduces Francesca to his world - which includes Satan worship. At the masked ball he hosts for his guests, Prospero sees someone dressed all in red even though he had forbidden anyone to wear that color. Prospero will soon face his greatest fears.—garykmcd Satan-worshiper Prince Prospero invites several dozen of the local nobility to his castle for protection against an oncoming plague, the Red Death. Prospero orders his guests to attend a masked ball and, amidst a general atmosphere of debauchery and depravity, notices the entry of a mysterious hooded stranger dressed all in red. Believing the figure to be his master, Satan, Prospero is horrified at the revelation of his true identity.—Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net> THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATHGrandmother (Sarah Brackett) is gathering kindling. The Man in Red (John Westbrook) calls to her, sitting under a tree. Causing a white rose to turn red, he gives it to her, telling her to take it to her village with the message that the day of their deliverance is at hand. She takes it and bows in honor.A royal carriage enters the village of Catania. Prince Prospero (Vincent Price) is making a personal appearance to invite the villagers to a feast. Gino (David Weston) pulls a baby out of the way just in time to keep it from being run over by the horses and carriage. Prospero gets out and begins inviting people to his feast. Gino sarcastically mouths that they will only receive scraps from his table like dogs. Gino tells Prospero that a holy man told an old woman that they would be delivered from his reign of terror. His father-in-law Ludovico (Nigel Green) comes up beside him. Prospero suggests that they should be on their knees thanking him. With a signal to his guards, the two men are lowered to their knees and strong-armed. Francesca (Jane Asher) runs up and begs for mercy. Prospero questions her and tells her that she must decide whether her father or her husband will die. Alfredo (Patrick Magee) comes up, remarking what entertainment this is for him and how innocent the girl is. Prospero promises that soon he will corrupt her and calls for Francesca to make a decision.A scream is heard and a guard sent to see about it. When the scream continues, Prospero goes himself. In a hut the guard is stunned. Prospero asks what it is, and the guard can only point and tell him to look. The old Grandmother has broken out with the Red Death (red spots on her face).Returning to the others, Prospero questions whether the three had any contact with the woman. When he determines they did not, he tells the guards to take the two men to the castle and he will take the girl. They are loaded up and Prospero tells the guards to burn the village. Gino questions why and Prospero tells him it is his deliverance.At the palace Prospero orders invitations to those whom he wants to attend his feast. Francesca is stripped by maidens and thrown into a hot bath. Prospero enters with Juliana (Hazel Court) and orders the maidens out. Francesca covers herself in modesty. Prospero questions why and asks whether the cross she wears is ornamental or symbolic of her faith. She attests to being a true believer and he orders her to remove it and never wear it again in the castle. He tells Juliana that after her bath to clothe Francesca in her finest gowns. Francesca asks about her father and Gino and is told they are being quartered. Prospero leaves and Juliana assures Francesca that she has not made a good impression on him. Francesca asks if Juliana will do as Prospero has told her. She replies that she will do as he says, as they all must.At the feast, Alfredo tells a woman he will tell her about terror. Prospero, overhearing, asks what he knows of terror. He calls him away into another room. Everyone follows. He questions whether terror is hearing the sounds of time ticking away as he walks past an antiquated clock. He suggests terror may be the sound of a heartbeat in fear or the sound of footsteps approaching.He introduces dancers Esmeralda (Verina Greenlaw) and Hop Toad (Skip Martin) who will entertain. Musicians enter playing and a dwarf, a young girl and a long-haired dog. As Esmeralda dances, Alfredo approaches Prospero, asking about her. Suddenly the girl knocks over a wine drink. Alfredo slaps her and she falls. Hop Toad begins to draw his knife, but upon seeing the anger of Prospero and Alfredo, he instead comes to raise up Esmeralda. Prospero leads Alfredo away, claiming the first act has disappointed but then throws wine in the face of Alfredo, who threatens him. Prospero then tells everyone they are lucky to be in the palace and safe from the Red Death which will spread the countryside.He invites everyone to a masquerade ball the following day at midnight, offering costumes to everyones use. He advises them not to wear red.Francesca enters in a white gown and is introduced to everyone by Prospero. First she is introduced to Señor Veronese (Julian Burton), who is told to act like a pig. He gets on the floor and rolls around as everyone laughs at him. Next Prospero calls for Señor Lampredi (Brian Hewlitt) to become a worm on the floor. He crawls around to everyones amusement. Prospero calls for Señora Escobar (Gaye Brown) to play a braying jackass. Señor Rivoli (Harvey Hall) is told to ride the jackass. Prospero tells everyone else to act like animals. Francesca is horrified.As Francesca is led away by Prospero into private quarters, Alfredo looks on with desire. In a yellow room Prospero tells her that his father once imprisoned a man there for three years. When the man was freed, he no longer could look at the sun or a daffodil. Prospero tells her that it was a test to control a mans mind.In a purple room he tells her that he doesnt believe in God; if God existed He must have died long ago. He believes someone or something exists in His place. Francesca believes in love and the goodness of God.Before they go into another room Prospero tells her she is not ready to enter that room. He tells her to rest from her long day. He promises her that the next day she will see Gino and her father.Prospero, roaming the castle later, is confronted by Juliana, who tells him she is ready to enter the deeper ceremonies which he believes in. He laughingly suggests that she is only ready because she wants to secure her position.In her room Francesca is awakened by the sound of wind. She goes over to a sconce that has gone out. As she turns back, she sees blood on a book and screams. Next she hears Prospero chanting in Latin. Putting on her robe, she goes out to investigate. She goes downstairs, following the sound of his voice. Entering the yellow room, she goes through the purple room and finds the door open to the next room. She goes through it into a black room where she sees Juliana and a raven cawing. Seeing Prospero lying in a coffin looking dead, she goes to touch his face. At that moment he opens his eyes and she screams and runs away. She is startled by Alfredo who is wearing a mask.The next day Prospero shows Francesca a falcon which kills another bird. He tells her it is trained by blinding its eyes until it becomes a slave to its master. He says that God blinded people with the cross and that he serves a different master. She begins to say that he forced her to remove her cross because it offended him. He interrupts her, saying that it offends no one following his master. He felt that it was discourteous to wear the symbol of a dead God. He confesses his master is Satan, Lord of Flies, the Fallen Angel and the Devil.Hearing a horn blowing, he tells her to come. Going to the battlement, he looks down as a carriage arrives. Scarlatti (Paul Whitsun-Jones) demands entrance to the castle as an invited guest. Prospero tells him he is no longer welcome due to the Red Death. He begs for sanctuary and offers up his wife to the Prince. Prospero informs him he has already had that doubtful pleasure. Begging for Prospero to spare him from the Red Death in the name of friendship, Scarlatti receives an arrow below the throat. Prospero throws down a dagger for the wife to kill herself with.In the dungeon, a sword is thrown down before Gino, who is told to learn to fight. He refuses to fight his friend. A swordfight ensues. Prospero and Francesca enter and witness the fight. When Gino wins, he tells Prospero that he will not fight his friend. Prospero promises torture, but Gino tells him that that would be considered losing. Intrigued, Prospero promises that after some thinking he will match the two together in a death fight.Walking through the dungeon, Prospero tells Francesca that sometimes life is cruel. She winces at the sound of a man in pain. She asks if Satan requires torture in his worship. He tells her of a Christian monk many years ago who tortured men, women and children in order to save their souls. He blames this on God. He promises to lead her into the ways of Satan. She refuses.Juliana prays and offers herself to Satan, branding her chest with an upside-down cross and asks to be made into a demon.Alfredo has a conversation with Hop Toad, who desires to serve someone other than Prospero. He promises his talents if Alfredo will take him in. Hop Toad persuades him to come to the ball in the costume of an ape which he will provide. Alfredo is pleased.Francesca hears someone trying to get into her bedroom door. She rises and stands aside as the door opens. Juliana comes in and Francesca sees the brand on her chest, asking if Prospero did it. Juliana admits she did it herself, marking her as a handmaiden of Satan. She tells Francesca that there is one more ceremony where she gives her soul to the devil to be immortal. She is hoping to be bound to Prospero and that Francesca would be out of the way. When Francesca tells her she would love to escape, Juliana gives her a key to the cell and urges her to free Gino and her father and escape.Francesca wanders through the dungeon, passing several men in the throes of torture. Finding the cell with Gino and her father, she frees them. As they pass the guard room, one of the guards sees someone go by and goes to check. A fight ensues with Gino, Ludovico and two guards. Coming out onto the battlement, Gino calls to a guard who turns to face him. It is Prospero, who calls out his guards. Francesca tells him that Juliana betrayed them.

Dancers and musicians perform. Prospero stands and calls for their attention. He announces that at midnight the masks will go on. He states that some among them still harbor good thoughts. He calls for the next entertainment to come in. Gino and Ludovico come in and stand before him. He throws down five daggers, one of which he says contains a poison that kills in five seconds. He tells them to each cut themselves with one of the daggers. Ludovico goes first, followed by Gino, then Ludovico again and Gino. The final dagger is taken by Ludovico, who tries to stab Prospero across the table with it. Ludovico is stabbed by a sword and falls dead. Prospero calls for them both to be killed since the game was not done correctly. Francesca begs for Ginos life. Prospero announces that he will not kill Gino, but release him so that he can die of the Red Death. Taunting Gino about his God, Prospero asks where his God is now. Gino says he will meet Him in paradise. The command is given to release him and Gino swears he will somehow return for Francesca.Francesca tells Prospero to allow her to go with Gino, which he refuses. Then she says bring him back and she will submit herself to whatever he wishes. At this point Juliana calls from across the room, telling the Prince that she is ready for the final ceremony.Gino is cast out of the castle and runs through the forest. The sounds of Prosperos fiendish laughter and the screams of Francesca are heard on the wind. As he stumbles on, he sees the Man in Red sitting under a tree, playing Tarot cards. Asking how it is going, Gino confesses that he has killed and that he is afraid for Francesca and afraid of Prosperos castle. The Man in Red gives Gino one of his cards as a sign. Gino takes it and returns to the castle.Meanwhile Alfredo is trying on the ape costume. Hop Toad directs him as how to walk slumped over and swinging his arms. He tells Alfredo that he can remove the costume once the unmasking is done.Gino finds a group of villagers heading for the castle to ask forgiveness and receive sanctuary. One woman is carried on a stretcher with the Red Death. Gino tries to stop them but is pushed aside.Juliana begins her ceremony, chanting at the altar. She drinks ceremonial wine drugged with hallucinogens. In the dreams she runs through hazy corridors and then finds herself on an altar. She is horrified to see five different men who wield weapons over her.When she comes to, she hears the laughter of Prospero and calls out to him. Searching from room to room, she tells him that she is now betrothed to the devil. He says there are more horrors to come. In the main room, she approaches the swinging pendulum and hears the voice of Prospero telling her that her fears have just begun. At this point she is attacked by one or more ravens that leave her dead and bloodied on the floor.One woman finds her and cries out. Prospero approaches with the other guests and tells the woman not to grieve for Juliana, for she has wed the devil. He calls for the masquerade to begin.Outside, the villagers arrive and call for mercy. They are told to return to Catania. One guard is sent to fetch Prospero.

When they refuse, he commands his archers to slay them.Inside, Prospero throws jewels down to the people, who scramble to gather them. He tells Francesca that all of these rich people suffer from greed and are desperate for more riches. Then he tells them to rejoice because the remaining villagers are now dead. He has promised all inside his castle will be safe from the Red Death. He tells Francesca that soon she will be initiated into understanding. Prospero and Francesca are seen dancing with the others.Gino climbs the castle walls with a makeshift rope he has made from vines. At the battlement he sees the Man in Red, who tells him to wait until one oclock at which time Francesca will be sent out to him. Gino is anxious to rescue her but is told to be wise. When he is shown a dead guard, he looks back and the Man in Red has vanished.Hop Toad enters the room of Esmeralda and tells her to be ready to leave the castle later when he comes for her. She tells him that she trusts him.At the party, Hop Toad and the ape make their appearance. Hop Toad cracks his whip, telling everyone that he controls the ape. As the ape seizes a woman and falls to the floor with her, Hop Toad unties a rope holding up a light fixture of candles and lowers it just above them. Citing that the ape is out of control, Hop Toad ties him to the candle fixture and lifts him up in the air. Alfredo complains and demands to be released but Hop Toad tells him he has insulted Esmeralda too much and deserves to pay. Dousing the ape with brandy, Hop Toad sets him on fire. As the party goers look on, their laughter changes to screams as the ape burns. The fixture collapses and Prospero calls for the guards to remove it. Hop Toad leaves the room and Prospero calls for a reward to be given to him.Across the crowded dance floor, Prospero sees the Man in Red. Telling Francesca that he commanded that no one should wear red, he follows through the different rooms. In the black room, he is confronted by the Man in Red (whose face is covered). Prospero tries to guess who it is, saying the voice is familiar. Suspecting that it is the devil himself, he makes Francesca bow down. Prospero calls for the man to show his face but is told that he will only see it upon his own death. He tells Prospero that the unmasking will reveal everyones faces soon.Leaving the room, the Man in Red calls for a new dance to begin. Prospero follows. With each wave of his hands, the Man in Red spreads the Red Death to those at the party. Prospero is pleased and remarks that he led all these friends to Satan and corrupted them for him. He asks that Francesca be spared and the Man in Red tells her to go to the battlements. Prospero tells her that he will join her when this is over.Prospero addresses the Man in Red, who denies being the devil. He says that he is death. Prospero insists that his own pact with Satan will save him. The Man in Red says that it will not. Prospero removes the mask to see his face. He is horrified to see his own face, made red from the Red Death. Prospero is then taken by all the guests who jostle him around the room. As the people begin to collapse from the Red Death, Prospero is the only one left standing. He retreats to the black room, hoping to escape from a horrible death. In that room he finds the red-cloaked figure, who strikes him with the Red Death.The Man in Red is seen playing cards with the young girl from the village. Several other men arrive and give reports of the deaths of many. The Man in Red tells them that only six survived: one man and woman, a dwarf and small lady and the girl from the village."

In 1879 Zululand, South Africa, the British are fighting the Zulus, and one of their columns has just been wiped out at Isandlwana. The Zulus next fix their sights on the small British outpost at Rorke's Drift. At the outpost are 150 British troops under the command of Lieutenants Bromhead and Chard. In the next few days, these 150 troops will fight about 4,000 Zulus in one of the most courageous battles in history.—grantss Two Lieutenants, Chard of Engineers and Bromhead, find that their 150-man contingent in Natal has been isolated by the destruction of the main British Army column, and that 4,000 Zulu warriors will descend on them in a few hours. Each has a different military background in tactics, and they are immediately in conflict on how to prepare for the attack. Nearly a third of the men are in the infirmary, as the Welsh company tries to somehow survive with no help in sight. Based on a true story.—John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> On January 22, 1879, the British Army suffered one of its worst defeats when Zulu forces massacred one thousand five hundred of its troops at Isandlhwana. A short time after the main battle, a Zulu force numbering nearly 4,000 warriors advanced on a British hospital and supply dump guarded by 150 Welsh infantrymen. This movie concentrates on this bloody 12-hour battle during which the British force, under their commander from the Royal Engineers, who happened to be in the area building a bridge, and happened to be senior to the infantry officer, received 11 Victoria Crosses. While taking some liberties with history, this movie followed reality fairly closely, including matching exactly the identities of the V.C. recipients.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> In January 1879, a communiqué to the government in London, (narrated by Richard Burton), details the crushing defeat of a British force at the hands of the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana on January 22, 1879.At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by Boer missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his daughter (Ulla Jacobsson), Zulu King Cetewayo (Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi) is also informed of the great victory earlier in the day. Witt and his daughter flee from the Zulu village to warn the British soldiers at their mission at Rorke's Drift about an impending Zulu attack.A company of the British Army's 24th Regiment of Foot, a Welsh regiment, is using the missionary station of Rorke's Drift in Natal as a supply depot and hospital for their invasion force across the border in Zululand. Upon receiving news of Isandhlwana from the Witts and that a large enemy force is advancing their way, Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers assumes command of the small 135-man British detachment, being senior by virtue of his commission date to Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine), who, as an infantry officer, is rather put out to find himself subordinate to an engineer.From a Boer frontier police officer, Chard and Bromhead are told of the Zulu's standard tactical doctrine, the simple but deadly effective Bull formation that enables a twinned pincer maneuver while a front force keeps the enemy occupied. Realising that they cannot outrun the Zulu army, especially with wounded soldiers and a counter-offensive against Zulu tactics would be suicide in any case, Chard decides to fortify the station and make a stand, using wagons, sacks of mealie, and crates of ship's biscuit. When Witt becomes drunk and starts demoralising the men with his dire predictions, causing the soldiers of the Natal Native Contingent to desert, Chard orders him and his daughter to leave. A group of Zulu warriors, on the hills around the fort, see them but recognizing them as missionaries, allow Witt and his daughter to pass by them.As the Zulu impis approach, a contingent of Boer horsemen arrives. They advise Chard that defending the station is hopeless before they flee, despite Chard's desperate pleas for them to stay. Minutes later, a low rumbling is heard which are thousands of Zulu warriors banging their spears against their cow-hide sheilds which according to Bromhead ""it sounds like a train"". The 4,000-strong Zulu impis appears on a ridge overlooking Rorke's Drift and advances to attack.After an inital assault, hundreds of Zulu riflemen open fire on the station from a neighbouring hill. Over the next few hours, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled. The Zulus do succeed in setting fire to the hospital, leading to intense hand-to-hand fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Malingering Private Henry Hook (James Booth) surprises everyone by taking charge in the successful breakout. Attacks continue into the night.The next morning, at dawn, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing ""Men of Harlech"". In the last assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a tiny redoubt that Chard had earlier ordered constructed out of mealie bags. With a reserve of soldiers hidden within the redoubt, they form into three ranks, and pour volley after volley into the stunned natives, who withdraw after sustaining heavy casualties. Later, the Zulus sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders and leave.The film ends with a narration by Richard Burton, listing the defenders who received the Victoria Cross, including Private Hook. Eleven were awarded for the actual fighting at Rorke's Drift."

Inspector Silvestri (Thomas Reiner), an arrogant police detective, arrives to take charge of the murder investigation. Silvestri soon discovers that the fashion house is a hotbed to drugs, corruption, and blackmail. The suspects include Massimo, the wealthy Ricardo Morellin (Frnaco Ressel), who was having an affair with Isabella, the dress designer Cesar Lazzarini (Louis Pigot), and Isabella's boyfriend Frank (Dante Di Paolo) an antique shop owner who sold cocaine to some of the models on a daily basis, as well as the handyman Marco (Massimo Righi).The following evening during a fashion show, when it is discovered that Isabella kept a diary which detailed most of the indiscretions, everyone is thrown into a quandary.

Fail Safe,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058083/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A technical malfunction sends American planes to Moscow to deliver a nuclear attack. Can all-out war be averted? A series of human and computer errors sends a squadron of American 'Vindicator' bombers to nuke Moscow. The President, in order to convince the Soviets that this is a mistake, orders the Strategic Air Command to help the Soviets stop them.—KC Hunt <khunt@eng.morgan.edu> When the United States Air Force's elaborate fail-safe systems fail, a squadron of nuclear-armed bombers crosses the Bering Strait into the USSR to attack. No one is quite sure why it happened but it's left to the President of the United States to try and find a solution with his Soviet counterpart. For some, like political scientist Professor Groetschele, the situation presents opportunities. He argues that they should not dwell on the morality of the attack and simply accept that it has happened. On that basis, he argues in favor of an all-out nuclear attack against the Soviet Union as the only sure way to ensure the survival of American culture and beliefs. The President sees it differently and works with the Soviets to stop the American bombers before they reach their target. When that fails, the President sees only one possible way to prevent global thermo-nuclear war.—garykmcd In the Cold War, there is a malfunction in the electronic system in Omaha and an American bomber wrongly receives the order to attack Moscow. The base commander and the President of the United States unsuccessfully try to call off the instruction, but the Soviet defense jams the airplane radio. The bombers commander Colonel Jack Grady heads with five other airplanes to accomplish the suicide mission in Moscow. The American President orders to shoot the bombers down but the other airplanes do not succeed. He contacts the Soviet Chairman explaining that the attack is a mistake and offers an unthinkable sacrifice to avoid the Soviet counterattacking. Will the Soviet accept?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A technical malfunction in the Pentagon's strategic control system causes an erroneous order to be sent to a B-52 squadron on a routine training mission instructing the bombers to fly beyond their fail safe distance. At this point the flight crew are trained to cease communications and prepare to fulfill their objective by bombing Moscow. As the planes near their target, the crisis deepens and together the Americans and Soviets decide on a final, desperate solution.—Dave Jenkins <david.jenkins@smallworld.co.uk> Warren Black lives in New York City and suffers a recurring nightmare about attending a bullfight that ends in a piercing shrieking noise. The nightmare fills him with doubts about his job as a Brigadier General in the US Air Force who is assigned to nuclear weapons.Walter Groteschele is a professor with some audacious ideas about nuclear warfare - namely that the common conception that any exchange of nuclear weapons will inevitably and imminently lead to an all-out exchange and the annihilation of the world is wrong. He is a civilian advisor to the Defense Department and Defense Secretary Swenson.Frank Bogan is commanding general of Strategic Air Command, the nuclear weapons arm of the Air Force, and he possesses faith in the vast array of high-tech equipment at his disposal, enough that he leads a short-notice tour of a visiting Congressman, Hubert Raskob, of SAC headquarters - though he must roust his executive officer, Colonel Warren Cascio, from an unplanned visit with his elderly father, a drunken hillbilly who lives in a basement apartment and whose alcoholism periodically leads to violence.Jack Grady, a Colonel in the Air Force, leads Group Six, a squadron of Vindicator nuclear bombers, supersonic jet aircraft derived from the B-58 Hustler bombers of the latter 1950s and based near Anchorage, AL. Grady and his wingman Billy Flynn debate the utility of their fellow pilots, young men who seem more like machines than the pilots they flew with in the Second World War.All of these men are soon caught up when a computer malfunction at SAC headquarters results in replacement of a faulty control piece. The replacement is routine but momentarily freezes up SAC's mainframe as the array of computers reboots. It appears of no concern - except the glitch activates the Fail-Safe box aboard Group Six; at the same time all radios aboard Group Six are jammed by Soviet Russia, and when the fail-safe signal aboard the planes is verified, it leaves Grady and his men thinking that nuclear war has broken out and they must execute their final order - penetrate Soviet Russia from the North Pole and launch multi-megaton explosives onto Moscow.The President Of The United States now must become involved as he and his translator, Peter Buck, travel deep underground to the White House command bunker, where a ""Hot Line"" direct voice communicator with the Soviet Premier awaits, with Buck hearing the Russian's voice and translating his words to the President. The President, the Secretary of Defense, and General Bogan work to try and stop Group Six, but the power of the planes and the crews' unshakable working orders - orders that include disregard of all outside voice communication on the suspicion of enemy disinformation - means that the six bombers penetrate Soviet Russia and overcome the Soviet Empire's vast antiaircraft grid.Making matters worse, when The President innocently asks the Soviet Premier about jamming of Group Six's radios, the Russian initially lies about it, and when he finally tells the truth the President still cannot convince Group Six to disengage. A direct communication link to Soviet air defense headquarters is opened and General Bogan is forced to dragoon one of his technical sergeants into telling the Russians how to detonate nuclear-armed air-to-air missiles, thus blowing up their own planes.With all indications being that the bombers will reach Moscow, the President makes a deal with the Soviets - a deal so stunning as to shake even the Soviet Premier into realizing that the President's pleas that the attack is an accident are manifestly the truth, but with the sickening realization that the President's proposal is the only way to avoid omnicide."

They plan to swim across the Nile to Cleopatra's palace, steal a galley and sail to Britain.Once at Cleopatra's palace, an Egyptian soothsayer (Jon Pertwee) warns Caesar of the plot to kill him, but Mark Anthony convinces Caesar from fleeing. Instead, Caesar convinces Hengist to change places with him, since Cleopatra and Caesar have never met.
On meeting, Cleopatra lures Hengist alone into her bed chambers, who accidentally exposes both Cleopatra and Mark Antony as would-be assassins. Hengist jumps into bed with Cleopatra and collapses and this exposes Antony who was hiding under Cleopatra's bed. Hengist and Caesar then ally with Horsa (who had climbed the palace walls into Cleopatra's bed chambers where he finds Gloria and rescues her), and after defeating Cleopatra's bodyguard Sosages (Tom Clegg) in combat, Hengist and the party flee Egypt.
Caesar is returned to Rome, only to be assassinated on the Ides of March. Horsa and Hengist return to Britain, and Mark Antony is left in Egypt to live ""one long Saturday night"" with Cleopatra."

The centennial the town is celebrating is its own destruction at the hands by a group of Union soldiers during the Civil War and their goal is revenge. One by one, they kill their guests of honor until only two remain. They flee but can't quite convince the police to help them.—garykmcd Over the opening credits, six Yankee tourists who make up two married couples, John and Bea Miller, David and Beverly Wells, driving a white Cadillac convertible, plus an unmarried couple of Tom White and Terry Adams, driving a red convertible, are lured via detour signs placed in the road into the fictional small Southern town of Pleasant Valley by ""redneck"" citizens, to be the ""guests of honor"" for the April 1965 centennial celebration of the two days where Union troops destroyed the town at the end of the Civil War. The three couples meet the town mayor, Joseph Buckman, and his two right-hand men, Rufus and Lester (the men who placed the phony detour signs), as well as shop owner Harper and his girlfriend Betsy. The tourists are initially treated with hospitality and given rooms to stay in the local Hunter Arms hotel.However that afternoon, after an argument with her husband, Bea goes off with Harper to a wooded area for alone time where he shows off his pocket knife, but then slices off her right thumb. Harper takes Bea to Mayor Buckman's office where she is accosted by Rufus and Lester who hold her down on a table and dismember her alive with an axe.Meanwhile, Tom tries to explain to Terry about something strange going on with the town and attempts to contact for help on the outside, but cannot get through. He tries using a local payphone where he tells a friend where he is staying. But unknown to Tom, the person on the other line is Mayor Buckman.That evening, Bea's dismembered limbs are roasted over a barbecue with the townspeople in attendance. Wandering away from the gathering, Tom and Terry discover a park plaque describing the ""blood centennial"" celebration in which they will be killed. While David and Beverly are taken back to the hotel, the drunken John is apprehended by the townspeople and made to participate in a ""horse race"", which entails his body being ripped apart limb by limb by four different horses who are roped to his extremities.The next day, the remaining tourists are forced to participate in various cruel games which lead to their gory deaths. David is lured by Betsy to a nearby hill where he is forcibly placed in a barrel embedded with nails and rolled downhill. Beverly is lured to the town square where she is tied up and is crushed by a boulder held aloft in a contraption resembling a carnival-style dunk tank.

They run to a nearby swamp area where Harper falls into a quicksand pit and drowns.With a little help from a little boy named Billy, who Tom and Terry take with them as a hostage/guide, they manage to locate Terry's car and drive out of town while being chased by Rufus, Lester, and a horde of townsmen. After releasing Billy, Terry and Tom make it to the nearby main road and drive away. Later, Tom and Terry arrive at a local police station where they tell the disbelieving sheriff about their ordeal. Back in Pleasant Valley, Mayor Buckman orders his people to take down the centennial banner and declares the celebration over.Tom and Terry return with the local policeman to Pleasant Valley, only discover that the town has disappeared. The policeman is skeptic to their story about the murderous townspeople, but comes to think there may be some truth in it as he tells Tom and Terry the story that 100 years ago as the Civil War was drawing to an end, a group of renegade Union troops attacked the small town of Pleasant Valley and, over two days, massacred the entire population of 2,000 people and burned the town to the ground. But there are local legends that the town's ghosts haunt the clearing and wooded areas where the town once stood. After leaving the area, Tom and Terry finally realize that the all of the townspeople of Pleasant Valley that they interacted with were ghosts who come back from the dead once every 100 years into their contemporary time to kill Northern people as a blood vengeance for their deaths.The film ends with Tom and Terry driving away, while the vengeful spirits of Rufus and Lester watch them depart, along with Harper who emerges from the quicksand pit where he drowned. Rufus and Lester talk about looking forward to the next centennial in 2065, when Pleasant Valley will rise again to resume its vendetta against the Yankees and what technology they expect will be in store for them and the town itself when they emerge from their limbo state. Harper, Rufus, and Lester walk into a nearby fog and disappear."

The Pawnbroker,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059575/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Jewish pawnbroker, victim of Nazi persecution, loses all faith in his fellow man until he realizes too late the tragedy of his actions. In a poor neighborhood of New York, the bitter and lonely Jewish pawnbroker Sol Nazerman is a survivor from Auschwitz that has no emotions or feelings. Sol lost his dearest family and friends in the war and his faith in God and belief in mankind. Now he only cares for money and is haunted by daydreams, actually flashbacks from the period of the concentration camp. Sol's assistant is the ambitious Latino Jesus Ortiz, who wants to learn with Sol how to run a business of his own. When Sol realizes that the obscure laundry business he has with the powerful gangster Rodriguez comes also from brothels, Sol recalls the fate of his beloved wife in the concentration camp and has a nervous breakdown. His attitude leads Jesus Ortiz to tragedy and Sol finds a way to cry.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Sol Nazerman manages a pawnshop in Harlem, which provides him enough money to support comfortably his sister-in-law's family on Long Island and the widow of an old colleague. He is an emotionless and direct man, which makes him effective, from an economic perspective, in negotiating with his largely desperate customers as he has no feeling about their plight. Most of his pawnshop acquaintances are unaware that his abrupt and detached demeanor is a result of what he witnessed as a Jewish concentration camp inhabitant during WWII, those incidents witnessed including the rape of his wife and the murder of his family by their Nazi captors. What happens on the streets of Harlem often reminds him of incidents at the concentration camp, he shutting off his feelings from what he now sees to survive emotionally. Before the war, he was a professor, a term which he now views with disdain. He has just hired a young man named Jesus Ortiz to work in the shop. Jesus, who has led a life of petty crime up until now, sees this job and his association with Sol, who he sees not only as a boss but a friend and mentor, as his first step in turning over a new leaf. One person who suspects what Sol has gone through is the new welfare worker in the neighborhood, Marilyn Birchfield, who has her own reasons for trying to break through his defenses. His life takes a turn when he discovers the true nature of the pawnshop owner, Rodriguez, which, although a negative in the issue itself, at least allows him to feel again for the first time since the war. The question becomes what he is going to do about it, especially in relation to Miss Birchfield and Jesus.—Huggo Sol Nazerman is a pawnbroker in a run down part of New York City near 126th St. The locals for the most part get loans of a dollar or two for small items and Sol makes most of his money laundering cash for a local gangster, Rodriguez. As an important anniversary approaches, Sol begins to have flashbacks to the time he and his family were arrested by the Nazis and put in a concentration camp. Life in the neighborhood is rough with small-time hoods stealing goods and then pawning them. When they learn of the cash payments Sol receives from Rodriguez, they decide to rob him. As his flashbacks bring him ever more grief, Sol rebels.—garykmcd This was one of the first films to deal with the effects of Nazi Germany's concentration camps on their survivors. Sol Nazerman, operator of a pawn shop, and a concentration camp survivor faces a horrid internal conflict. Being engulfed in a New York ghetto Environment, Sol suffers flashbacks. The flashbacks juxtapose concentration camp treatment with ghetto neighborhood treatment. Although, the flashbacks suffer several historical inaccuracies, the point is well made. His internal conflicts between submitting to the same injustices he and his family suffered or resisting the injustice a peak at the end of the film—Alexander Nicolas <anicolas@umich.edu>"

The Killers,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058262/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Surprised that their contract victim didn't try to run away from them, two professional hit men try to find out who hired them and why. A remake ofThe Killers (1946)which itself was inspired by the Ernest Hemingway short story. Told instead from the hitmen's point of view, the killers decide to find out why their latest victim (a race car driver) ""just stood there and took it"" when they came to shoot him. They also figure on collecting more money. Ronald Reagan plays a rich, double-crossing financier. Lovely Angie Dickinson plays the femme fatale.—Mark Logan <marklo@west.sun.com> Two professional killers fulfill a contract hit on an auto mechanics teacher in a school for the blind but are surprised that he does not try to flee and appears to welcome his fate. Charlie Strom, the older of the two hit-men, wonders why they have been overpaid for the assignment, and when he finds out that the victim, Johnny North, a former Formula One race car driver, had been involved in a million dollar robbery, they decide to pursue the matter. They become convinced that discovering the identity of the man who hired them is the key to finding the stolen money as they search out North's past with brutal efficiency.—G. Taverney (duke1029@aol.com) When the target has been located after successfully hiding out for four years by the unknown person hiring them, hitmen Charlie and his partner Lee are paid approximately three times the going rate in a contract to eliminate a once somewhat famous race car driver, Johnny North. Beyond the unknown identity of whoever hired them, Charlie is struck by the fact that Johnny seemed to know they were coming for him and yet did not run but willingly took the bullet instead. Examining the facts, Charlie believes the hit had something to do with the rumor that Johnny was involved in a $1 million heist and that whoever hired them was willing to pay as much as he/she did because he/she is in possession of that $1 million, with a trivial few thousand for the contract being pocket change. As such, Charlie, with Lee by his side, is after whoever hired them for whatever is left of the $1 million. In following the story of Johnny leading up to whatever the nature of that heist, Charlie and Lee discover that the story always comes back to a proverbial ""dame"" that entered his life shortly before his last legitimate race, someone by the name of Sheila Farr who may be the one holding the cash or may be just caught innocently in the cross-hairs of what went on with Johnny.—Huggo Two professional hit men, the middle-aged Charlie (Lee Marvin) and the younger Lee (Clu Gulager), enter a school for the blind and terrorize the principal until she reveals the whereabouts of a teacher, 'Jerry Nichols' (John Cassavetes). As the hit men walk toward North's upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a phone call from the blind principal's aide, warning him of their arrival. However, a saddened Johnny responds, ""It's okay. I know them."" He calmly waits at his desk as Charlie and Lee enter the classroom and shoot him to death in a fusillade of bullets.As they depart town by train, Charlie admits that he is bothered that their target refused to flee, aware that he was warned prior to their arrival. Lee notes that he recognized their target and that his name was actually 'Johnny North' a former race car driver. Lee also notes that from the look on Johnny's face when they entered the classroom is that he wanted them to kill him. It is revealed here that both Charlie and Lee were anonymously sub-contracted and paid $25,000 a piece by an unseen party to kill Johnny North. It is apparent that the hit men's business is not to make any direct contact with their paying clients, or know their names, just the name of their hit. Charlie and Lee run through a file they were given of what they knew about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash. A few years before his death, he was involved in a one million dollar mail truck robbery. Tempted by the thought of a $1 million payday, Charlie and Lee travel to Miami in order to interview Johnny's former mechanic, Earl Sylvester (Claude Atkins).Earl, who considers himself Johnny's only friend, is devastated to learn of his death. In between sobs and gulps of whiskey, he tells the story to Charlie and Lee as he remembers it:Four years earlier in California, Johnny North was at the top of his profession when he met the beautiful Sheila Farr (Angie Dickinson) who asked him out to dinner. Despite Earl's suspicions, Johnny fell deeply in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny's late night days with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. As a result, his racing career ended with a fiery crash.At the hospital, Earl told Johnny the truth about Sheila, who was in reality the mistress of mob boss Jack Browning (Ronald Reagan). Known for her extravagant taste for ""adrenellen junkies"", Sheila had already cheated on Browning with several other sports figures, a bullfighter in Mexico and a boxer in New York City..... all of whom met bad ends (usually violent deaths or ""accidents""). Enraged and heartbroken, Johnny rebuffed Sheila's attempts to explain and he cut his ties to her.Flashing forward back to the present, the intrigued Charlie and Lee travel to New Orleans and approach a former member of Browning's crew, named Mickey (Norman Fell), at a health spa whom they restrain in a steam machine and under the threat of violence, Mickey also reveals his memories:One year after the crash, Sheila found Johnny working as a pit mechanic during another race. Although Johnny bitterly attempted to drive her away for ruining his life, Sheila insisted on telling him that a much better job might soon be his for the taking.Meanwhile, Browning was in the process of planning the robbery of a U.S. postal truck. On Sheila's recommendation, he agreed to take Johnny on as his getaway driver.After Johnny refused to return her phone calls, Sheila called up in person at his dilapidated apartment. Although Johnny still felt used and betrayed, Sheila said that she had always regretted losing him and could not live without him. Deeply moved, Johnny agreed to forgive her. He also helped Browning by souping up the getaway car.However, Browning was deeply enraged when he learned that Sheila had returned to Johnny in which his goons forced Johnny to come to his office. In a deliberate provocation, Browning brutally slapped Sheila in front of Johnny. Enraged, Johnny instantly punched Browning in the face and threatened to kill him if he ever hurt Sheila again. However, they both agreed to ""settle this,"" after the job, and went back to planning the robbery.Ultimately, the mail truck was forced onto an isolated mountain road by a detour sign planted by Browning and Johnny. When the truck later stopped at an apparent accident, Browning, Johnny, Mickey and the other conspirators robbed the truck at gunpoint, stole more than $1 million, and loaded it into the getaway car. However, Johnny punched Browning, threw him out of the moving car, and drove off with the money for himself.Flashing back to the present, after listening to this story, Charlie and Lee decide to pay a visit to Jack Browning, who is now a real estate developer in Los Angeles. After arriving in L.A., Charlie and Lee pay a visit to Browning at his office who denies knowing who they are, as well as when they ask about the mail truck robbery or if he knew Johnny North. Browning, however, insists that he is now an honest businessman and has no idea what happened to the money. He does, however, reveal that Sheila is staying at a downtown hotel and agrees to arrange a meeting with her.Determined not to give Browning time to plan an ambush, Charlie and Lee arrive at Sheila's hotel room several hours earlier than agreed. At first Sheila denies knowing Johnny or anything about the money. However, Charlie and Lee brutally beat her and dangle her by the ankles out of her seventh story window. Terrified, she agrees to tell them the truth:Flashing back to the night before the robbery, Sheila entered Johnny's room and told him that his life was in danger. Browning, she said, was planning to kill him and pocket his share of the robbery. Enraged, Johnny wanted to leave and kill Browning on the spot. Sheila, however, insisted that she had a much better idea. On her advice, Johnny threw Browning out of the car and drove off with the money. Later that night, he met with Sheila.As the two lovers departed with the money to a nearby hotel room, they were confronted by Browning. Sheila ordered Browning to, ""do it quickly,"" and the gangster shot Johnny in the stomach. Although severely wounded, Johnny fled into the night with Browning and Sheila in hot pursuit. Unable to find him, Sheila expressed fear that Johnny would cause as much trouble as his predecessors whom she duped into helping them with their plans. Therefore, it was indeed Browning who anonymously hired Charlie and Lee to murder Johnny.As Sheila comes to the end of her story, Charlie realizes at last why Johnny refused to flee when they went to kill him. The only man who refuses to run is a man who considers himself to be already dead. Sheila's betrayal had already emotionally killed Johnny long before the bullets ever touched him. Johnny wanted to die (though it is unclear if he knew that Browning was behind the hit). Deciding that Browning deserves to be punished, Charlie and Lee decide to hold Sheila, his wife, for ransom.However, as the three depart the hotel, Browning opens fire on them with a sniper rifle. Lee is killed instantly, while a wounded Charlie flees back into the hotel.Meanwhile, at their suburban mansion, Browning and Sheila frantically prepare to escape with the money which they have hidden in their safe. Then, a dying Charlie storms through their front door.At last revealing her sociopath nature, Sheila frantically denies any role in Johnny's death, insisting that her husband alone was responsible. Browning maintains that it was not him who hired Charlie and Lee to kill Johnny, but it was Sheila. Charlie calmly shoots Browning dead and turns his revolver toward Sheila. When she again pleads for her life, Charlie snarls, ""Lady, I don't have the time!"" He kills Sheila with a single bullet and hobbles out the door. He falls dead on the lawn while still gripping the money."

The Gospel According to St. Matthew,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058715/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The life of Jesus Christ according to the Gospel of Matthew. Pasolini shows Christ as a Marxist avant-la-lettre and therefore uses half of the text of Matthew. Along a rocky, barren coastline, Jesus begins teaching, primarily using parables. He attracts disciples; he's stern, brusque, and demanding. He comes to bring a sword, not peace, he says. He's in a hurry, moving from place to place near the Sea of Galilee, sometimes attracting a multitude, sometimes being driven away. His parables often take on the powers that be, so he and his teachings come to the attention of the Pharisees, the chief priests, and elders. They conspire to have him arrested, beaten, tried, and crucified, just as he prophesied to his followers. After he dies, he appears to his disciples and gives them final instructions.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

During his stay, he bears witness to the castle's gruesome past coming to life before him, and falls in love with a beautiful female ghost. A writer accepts a bet that he cannot spend the night alone in a haunted castle on All Soul's Eve.

In the US version they were given American-sounding names. Below they are referred to in their real Italian names.**On a cold dark night a man is seen outside the Four Devils Tavern in London, looking around. Entering, he goes downstairs where Edgar Allan Poe (Silvano Tranquilli) is reciting lines from one of his stories to Lord Thomas Blackwood (Umberto Raho) and the bartender. He listens for a moment, then introduces himself as Alan Foster (Georges Rivière), a reporter who has been trying to get an interview with Poe. Remembering him as having pursued him without response, he invites Foster to sit down. They discuss death and whether there is an afterlife. At one point, Sir Blackwood invites Foster to spend a night in his castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea at Providence. He must remain there from midnight to dawn, upon which he will receive 100 pounds sterling. Refusing the bet at first, Foster offers to try it for 10 pounds. He is told by both Blackwood and Poe that all those who tried before ended up dead. The most recent deaths were a newlywed couple who never returned but are buried in the castle cemetery. Foster agrees and Poe agrees to accompany them to the castle (which is a two-hour ride by carriage) during which he will interview Poe at length.As they arrive at the castle in the middle of the night, Poe asks Foster if he has any second thoughts before he is left alone. Having none, they bid him goodnight saying they will return in the morning. He waves as they leave. Going inside the gates, he wanders through the narrow cemetery. He sees only a black kitten hanging around. As he ascends the steps he finds a woman's garment which he picks up and carries inside with him.Inside he finds an old dusty castle, very dark and dank. Lighting a candelabra, he begins looking round. He hears a noise and goes to an open window. Looking out, he sees nothing and closes it. He taps his cane on an ancient dining table, covered in dust. He sets the candelabra down, removes his cape and hat and places them on the table. Picking up the candelabra, he explores more until he hears a large clock striking eleven. He looks at the grandfather clock, which shows 11:30. The pendulum appears still. As he turns away, he hears the clock strike once more. He looks and sees the pendulum swinging. As he approaches, it stops. He compares the time to that of his pocket watch and sees they are the same.As he looks into another room, he is startled by the image of a man. He goes to investigate and finds a full-length mirror. Tapping on it, he tells himself not to be afraid of his own reflection. He goes on and sees a portrait of Julia Alert (Margrete Robsahm). As he looks again, the portrait seems to be rippling. He tells himself its only a portrait and returns to the table, setting down the candelabra and pulling out note paper and pencil. He tells the portrait that he will make some notes and begins writing.All at once he hears music playing and gets up to see. In another room, he sees a couple dancing but as he approaches the door, it slams shut. Forcing the door open, he finds a dark music room with a harpsichord and harp. He lights a candelabra on the harpsichord, and noticing sheet music there, he sits and begins playing it. Suddenly we see a hand reaching out to touch his shoulder from behind. He is startled and turns to see Elisabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele) who asks if her brother sent him. Rising, he tells her Lord Blackwood made a bet, but he didn't know anyone else would be in the castle or he wouldn't have accepted the bet. She tells him she fell out with her brother because she was in love with the gardener Herbert (Giovanni Cianfriglia) and Lord Blackwood didn't approve. He tells her he will leave rather than cause her misery, but she insists he stay and win the bet. She says that his room has been prepared. He is surprised and asks how she knew he was coming. She replies that her brother makes the same wager every year on this night and someone comes. As they continue walking, the candles go out just as Elisabeth laughs. He asks who blew them out and she answers only the wind. As they pass by the portrait of Julia, it seems to be rippling again. Elisabeth doesn't see the rippling, but asks about it. Again he tells her he will leave and gather his belongings. She sees the garment he brought in and picks it up, smelling it. He tells her he found it outside.They go upstairs to a bedroom where he sets the candelabra on a desk. Elisabeth sits on the bed and calls him to sit beside her. He comes close and she asks about the world outside. He tells her nothing has changed, but that it is a shame that the world cant share her beauty. She asks him if he finds her attractive and he admits he does. She asks about him and he tells her there is not much to tell. He is single, lonely and works in London as a writer.Suddenly Julia enters the room and says that they have not been introduced. Elisabeth warns Julia not to interfere, telling her that Foster was sent to her by her brother. Julia challenges that, asking Foster if it is true. He says only that he is there because of a wager. Elisabeth tries to get Julia to leave and not to cause any trouble. When she refuses, Elisabeth says that she will leave and does. Julia tells him it is late and that she will also retire. He asks if he will see her in the morning and she tells him no. When he asks if she is leaving, she tells him, no, I only said you wont see me in the daylight. She leaves and he ponders all that was said.Outside in the hall, the two women talk. Elisabeth tells Julia that he belongs to her, that she is in love with him, and they will be happy together. Julia tells her she will not be happy and that he will soon learn the secret of this place. Julia threatens to tell him. Elisabeth is upset and runs off.In his room, Foster removes his coat and looks at a small stack of books on the desk. He picks one up and opens it. The title page reads: CARMUS: ELEMENTS OF METAPHYSICS MEDICINE. He goes to the bed to begin reading, but is distracted by a noise coming from the door. He notices the door handle slowly opening. He rises and gets his derringer and stands by the door. When he pulls the door open, he sees Elisabeth, who says that he is still awake. He invites her in and she goes to the bed, where she sees the book. She says that she will leave, so he can read it. He persuades her to remain, telling her how much he likes her and is attracted to her. She answers that she is pleased to hear this and that she wants his body warmth. She asks him to kiss her and embrace her. They embrace and she begs for his kisses and for him to warm her.Meanwhile Julia is listening outside the door. She remarks to herself that she tried to warn Elisabeth but was unsuccessful. She turns to go and runs into William (Benito Stefanelli) who asks about Elisabeth. Julia tells him she will inform Herbert.Alan and Elisabeth are seen in bed, where he expresses his joy of meeting her. She tells him she cant be part of his world because he is in the present, while hers is in the past. He tells her that he doesn't believe that, resting his head on her chest. As he caresses her arm, he suddenly notices that she has no heartbeat. He looks at her and calls her name. She answers and he tells her that he was afraid her heart had stopped beating. She tells him that her heart has not beaten for ten years since she died.Suddenly Herbert bursts into the room with a knife and stabs Elisabeth. He runs from the room with Alan following. Alan shoots him and he falls. As he watches, the body vanishes. Alan returns to the bedroom to find it empty. He begins calling for Elisabeth, going room to room. All at once he encounters Dr. Carmus (Arturo Dominici), who tells him that he will be unable to find Elisabeth. They go into his study where he offers Alan a drink of whiskey. He explains about the three parts of life. The first part (the weakest) is the human body. Second is the spirit within, and third are the senses, which he explains live on after death in some bodies. Alan scoffs at this and Carmus tells him he will prove it. Removing a small case from a cabinet, he produces a small venomous snake which he puts on a table. Cutting off the head, he tells Alan to note how the body continues moving without the head and the head, though severed from the body is still dangerous enough to bite. Alan says that may be true for reptiles, but he doesn't believe its the same for humans. Carmus takes him to the window, where he points out below the graves of Elisabeth and the others. He tells Alan that tonight they each will live out the last five minutes of their lives until they died.They ascend a staircase and Alan begs for more details about Elisabeth. Suddenly the clock chimes and Carmus tells him that the time is at hand and that words mean nothing. He is told to watch below. The room plays back the evening of a festive party where Elisabeth was dancing with her husband William, who stops and goes to get her a drink. As she waits by a window, Herbert knocks from outside. She opens it and he insists on seeing her. She tells him she will try to see him later and closes the window. Julia sees her talking to Herbert but says nothing. William brings the drink to his wife. Sir Blackwood and his wife approach and inform their hosts they must leave. Escorting them outside, Elisabeth then turns aside to talk to Herbert. He takes her aside into the stable and demands her loyalty, saying that she promised herself to him while her husband was away. Suddenly the dream fades and Carmus tells Alan that their deaths will be replayed tonight, as every year at this time.He takes Alan into the bedroom where William and Elisabeth are in bed together. Herbert comes in and strangles William. He then turns on Elisabeth to kill her, but he is knocked out by Julia with a candlestick. He falls with half his face indented from the blow. Julia turns to comfort Elisabeth, telling her she is now safe. Elisabeth reaches for a knife and stabs Julia. Getting out of bed, Elisabeth views the three dead bodies and screams. Alan says he doesn't want to see anymore, and that it must be a trick. Carmus tells Alan that there is more for him to see.Alan sees that the bedroom is now empty. No bodies are present. He begins searching again, calling for Carmus and Elisabeth. When he reaches the study of Carmus, the door opens and he goes in. Next he sees Carmus, who takes a drink of whiskey. Hearing a banging noise, Carmus takes a candelabra and goes from door to door and window to window until he finds the door that keeps banging open and shut. Opening it, he goes downstairs into the crypt room. He passes by an ornate coffin showing a man and a dog to a stone bier. He slides the cover off to see a decomposed woman inside. As he watches, she begins to breathe, then converts into a mist. Going back to his study, he sits down and begins to write. Suddenly Herbert enters and kills him, then bites to suck blood from his neck. At this point Carmus comes back into the room, telling Alan that he has seen how Carmus met his end. When Alan looks at the desk again, no one is there. He picks up the paper Carmus wrote on and reads: Blood is the fountain of life; only blood brings back the dead to life; we will drink from this fountain!!Alan hears ghostly laughter and pulls out his derringer. Realizing the gun will do no good, he drops in on the desk and exits the study. Soon he hears more laughter from outside. As the front door opens, he hides to watch. The bride (Sylvia Sorrente) and groom enter to spend their wedding night.
As they go upstairs, Alan calls out to them to warn them they are going to their deaths, but realizes they cant hear him and there is nothing he can do but watch. He notices the door standing open and goes to it. It closes and he tries to open it, but the handle breaks off. He realizes he is trapped. He begins calling out loud, hoping Carmus can set him free while he is still alive.Upstairs, the amorous couple is kissing but hears a noise. He goes to investigate and she begins to undress by the fire. As she gazes at her reflection in the mirror, we see Herbert approach from behind. Seeing him, she screams as he attacks. Her husband rushes in to find Elsi dead, and is killed by Herbert. The scene vanishes and Alan sees the couple approaching him. They tell him it is now his turn. He runs downstairs and sees Carmus, who tells him that he is next. He tries to run, but each of them are closing in on him. All at once he sees Elisabeth, who tells him which way to run. She says they need his blood to be able to live again next year for a few minutes.
Alan runs down a hall and is trapped as the others approach. At the last second, Elisabeth opens a door and leads him through. Again she tells him they need his blood but if he can escape they will die. He tells her to come with him, grabbing her arm. She cries no, that she cannot enter his world. He insists, pulling her along through corridors. She continues to tell him that she cant come with him because she is dead. Finally they go outside where she collapses, telling him goodbye. Her body deteriorates completely away until she is only dust. He stumbles through the graveyard, hearing the voices of the others calling him. As he comes under the tree with the low branches, he sees the bodies of the others hanging from high limbs. They all tell him there is no escape and they will live by his blood. He makes it to the gate and steps outside, thinking he is safe. Suddenly the gate closes and a metal rod pierces him through, killing him and holding his body upright.The next morning Poe and Blackwood arrive in their carriage and Poe remarks how he is standing there. But when they approach they see he is dead. Blackwood takes money from Alans wallet, telling Poe he must collect on the debt. Blackwood says he will arrange for burial in the cemetery. Poe says he can now write the story, but no one will believe it.The voices of Elisabeth and Alan are heard talking to each other. She says you stayed with me, Alan. He replies: yes, Elisabeth."
Strait-Jacket,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058620/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a twenty-year stay at an asylum for a double murder, a mother returns to her estranged daughter where suspicions arise about her behavior.

After twenty years in an asylum, Lucy is released by her Dr. Anderson and her brother Bill Cutler brings her back to her farm where he lives with his wife and Carol. Lucy meets her estranged daughter and she learns that she is going steady with the wealthy Michael Fields. Soon Lucy has nightmares and hears children singing a pejorative song about her. When Dr. Anderson unexpectedly visits her at home, she shows that she is unbalanced and the doctor decides to take her back to the asylum. However he is axed in the barn. Is Lucy killing again?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Lucy Harbin has been imprisoned in an insane asylum for twenty years for murdering her husband Frank Harbin and his paramour that night, Stella Fulton, Lucy who decapitated their heads with an ax before indiscriminately wielding it to other parts of their bodies. The murders were witnessed by Lucy and Frank's then adolescent daughter, Carol Harbin, who was eventually adopted by Lucy's brother and his wife, Bill and Emily Cutler. With only a brusque hand named Leo Krause helping, the Cutlers now live on a farm in California, far away from the Harbins' house in Ohio where the murders were committed so that Carol could get away from the public scrutiny of her mother's murderous act. The Board at the asylum, believing she now reformed and well enough on new medications, is releasing Lucy into Bill and Emily's custody, the decision against the advice of Lucy's physician, Dr. Anderson. Carol, an up and coming sculptress, is nervously excited about seeing her mother after twenty years. Carol wants to be as open as possible about her mother's situation to others, however she tells only one person not in the know about Lucy, namely her boyfriend, Michael Fields, the son of wealthy dairy owners, Raymond and Alison Fields. As Carol and Michael are planning on getting married, Carol wants no secrets of this nature from Michael. Seeing how scared and depressed her mother looks, Carol wants to brighten her life by transforming her into the young, vivacious woman Carol remembers as her mother. However, that transformation as well as other issues in general life evoke the murders and the incarceration for Lucy, who still seems to be suffering from mental illness exacerbated by these emotional triggers. Eventually, some people within this situation go missing, the collective, with the exception of the perpetrator, not knowing that the missing have been killed by someone wielding an ax. Has Lucy reverted back into her ax murdering ways?—Huggo Various flashbacks and images introduce Lucy Harbin [Joan Crawford], a young woman who comes home unexpectedly to find her husband in bed with another woman. Carol, their very young daughter, is in bed right in the next room, but she is awake. Heartbroken, Lucy suffers a moment of fury and confusion that leads her to spontaneously pick up a nearby axe and decapitate her husband and his lover while they sleep. Carol watches in terror and shock as Lucy hacks the two bodies to pieces. Lucy is declared insane and sent to an asylum, where she endures traumatic shock treatments for her mental breakdown.The narrator of the flashback is revealed to be Carol, now a young woman. It is twenty years later, and Carol is opening up about her past to her boyfriend, Michael Fields. After Lucy's incarceration, Carol was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Bill and Emily, and the family lives on a farm in a rural location. Carol is revealing the family history to Michael because Lucy is being released from the asylum, and is coming to live with the family. When Lucy arrives, she is skittish. She cautiously acclimates to the farm, exploring the area with Carol and meeting the gritty-looking farm hand, Krause. But she is clearly thrilled to see Carol again, and is touched by the lovely young woman Carol has become. Carol is a sculptress and has a spacious studio filled with her work, and she thrills Lucy by giving her a bust of herself just as she was in her youth.Things quickly start to get strange. Carol shocks Lucy by presenting her with two bracelets she used to wear when she was a young woman, large dangling charm bracelets that jangle when she walks. Carol seems intent on recreating Lucy as a young woman, taking her clothes shopping and buying her a wig that mimics the hairstyle she wore the last time Carol saw her. Lucy is uncomfortable with this, but agrees to dress this way to please her daughter, whom she desperately wants to make amends with. While they are in the wig shop, Lucy hears strange voices, as if children are singing a morbid nursery rhyme about her crimes. She dismisses it as nerves. Later, she suffers a terrible nightmare and wakes up to discover two bloody heads in bed with her, with a bloody axe lying nearby. When she wakes the others, the items are gone from her room. Lucy starts to think she is relapsing.Things get worse when Carol attempts to introduce Michael to her mother. When Michael stops by for drinks, Lucy seems to try and seduce him, all with Carol right there in the room. The embarassing scene is interrupted by Lucy's former psychiatrist, Dr. Anderson, who makes an unexpected visit. When he sees how unstable Lucy seems, Dr. Anderson makes comments to the family that suggest he would like to take Lucy back to the hospital. When the doctor gets Lucy alone, his comments upset her and she runs off. As Dr. Anderson searches for her around the farm, he enters the darkened barn and a shadowy figure corners him--it appears to be Lucy, the silhouette revealing her hairstyle and figure, right down to the jangling bracelets she wears. The figure is holding an axe, and quickly decapitates Dr. Anderson.Carol returns to the farmhouse to find her mother alone in the darkened living room. The doctor's car is still outside, and Carol quickly comes to the conclusion that her mother has killed him. In a panic, Carol drives the doctor's car into a barn and locks it in, but she is spotted by Krause, who is lurking the shadows. The next day, Carol sees Krause painting the car a different color and angrily confronts him, but he smugly suggests that he knows what happened to the doctor, and that he'll turn Lucy in to the authorities if Carol fires him. Lucy overhears the conversation from the window. Later that evening, Krause is stalked and murdered with the axe.Lucy prepares for an evening that she dreads, a dinner party intended to introduce her to Michael's parents. If Michael and Carol are to be married, these will be their in-laws, and Michael's family is very wealthy, his father being the proprietor of a very successful dairy farm. Lucy has a panic attack in the powder room while at the Fields'--after spilling coffee on her dress, she retreats to the washroom and suffers a flashback because of the wallpaper, which resembles the bars of a prison cell. Carol calms her down and takes her back to the party. Mr. & Mrs. Fields are cordial until they plot to get Lucy alone so they can have a private conversation with her: Mrs. Fields is suspicious of Lucy, and poor Lucy makes a terrible misstep by revealing to Mr. & Mrs. Fields that her daughter and Michael are planning to be married. The Fields had not been informed of this yet, and they react disapprovingly. Mrs. Fields in particular gets very haughty with Lucy, making suggestions about her past, and Lucy suddenly snaps at her, revealing that she was in an asylum for twenty years. She says that under no circumstances will she allow the Fields' to interfere with her daughter's happiness, and she storms out of the house.Michael drives Emily and Carol back to their house while he and Bill go out looking for Lucy, who has disappeared. Emily sends Carol to bed, but Carol is restless and cannot sleep. With Michael gone from the Fields' house, Mr. and Mrs. Fields are alone in their house and they hear sounds to suggest someone is prowling around. Mr. Fields is oblivious, but when he goes into his closet to get undressed for the evening, he is attacked by the figure of Lucy, brandishing an axe. Mrs. Fields becomes suspicious and goes looking for her husband, eventually finding his body in the dressing room. Horrified, she retreats, only to be confronted by the figure of Lucy in the bedroom. Before the axe can fall, the bedroom door opens and the real Lucy comes in; after scuffling with the other figure, Lucy tears off a mask to reveal her daughter's face underneath. Carol has been committing the murders while dressing as her mother; scarred by witnessing the double homicide committed by her mother, Carol's mind was unstable ever since. Certain that Mr. and Mrs. Fields would never allow Michael to marry her without a great deal of trouble, she plotted to make it appear as if Lucy murdered them in a rage, which would send Lucy back to the asylum and allow her to marry Michael. Her mind shattered, Carol clutches the mask of her mother and screams at it ""I hate you! I hate you! Oh I'm sorry, I love you! I hate you! I love you!"" Outside on the porch, Lucy hears her daughter's insane ravings and weeps, perhaps remembering her own moment of insanity.An epilogue reveals Lucy discussing her plans with Bill. With Carol now committed to an asylum just as she once was, Lucy intends to stand by her daughter and be whatever kind of support that she needs."

I Am Cuba,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058604/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Four vignettes about the lives of the Cuban people set during the pre-revolutionary era. This study of Cuba--partially written by renowned poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko--captures the island just before it made the transition to a post-revolutionary society. Moving from city to country and back again, I AM CUBA examines the various problems caused by political oppression as well as by great discrepancies in wealth and power. Beginning in Havana in the pre-Castro era, we see how foreigners contributed to the city's prostitution and poverty; this sequence features dreamy, hallucinogenic camera work that creates a feeling of unease and dislocation. Then, in glorious images of palm tress and fertile land, the film looks at the sugar cane fields in the countryside, and the difficulties faced by peasants working the land. Finally, back in the city again, leftist students battle the police and a corrupt government--and pay a high price for their rebellion.—Mr Bongo Four vignettes in Batista's Cuba dramatize the need for revolution; long, mobile shots tell almost wordless stories. In Havana, Maria faces shame when a man who fancies her discovers how she earns her living. Pedro, an aging peasant, is summarily told that the land he farms has been sold to United Fruit. A university student faces down a crowd of swaggering U.S. sailors and then watches friends shot by police when they try to distribute a pro-Castro leaflet. The war arrives on the doorstep of peasants Mariano, Amelia, and their four children when Batista's forces bomb the hills. Mariano wants peace, so he seeks out the guerrillas to join the fight.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

Walter recruits the team, which includes alarms expert Cedric Page (Robert Morley), strong man Hans Fisher (Jess Hahn), and circus acrobat Giulio ""the Human Fly"" (Gilles Ségal). Since the museum's floor is completely pressure-alarmed, it will be necessary to lower Giulio by rope from a rooftop window and raise the the heavy glass cover enclosing the mannequin on which the dagger is displayed. Giulio will then replace the dagger with a copy and leave the scene intact in the hope that the theft will not be discovered until the thieves leave the country. This method will require two strong men, Hans and Walter, holding ropes - one to raise the glass cover and the other to hold Giulio.The plan calls for shooting out a searchlight and exploding smoke grenades to distract the guards when the team leaves the museum. Walter hides a rifle and some smoke grenades inside the door jamb of a convertible limousine. In Greece, he hires a small-time hustler named Arthur Simpson (Peter Ustinov) to drive the car to Istanbul.

One evening, the drunken and obnoxious cook Gerven (Akim Tamiroff) annoys Hans to the point that a melee breaks out. In the confusion, Hans manages to break his hands when a window is slammed shut. With Hans out of commission, the plan cannot go forward without a second rope holder, and Cedric demurs that he is not strong enough.Walter and Elizabeth put Simpson through a test of strength, which he passes, barely. They decide to offer Simpson $10,000 to participate in the robbery. Simpson agrees, but then lets slip that he is working for Turkish security. Walter decides to go through with the robbery anyway, but to move it forward to that same evening.Though the group is being tailed by police, they manage to slip away one by one at a crowded wrestling match. Since they can no longer shoot out lights or use smoke grenades, Elizabeth, with Cedric's help, will distract the guards using her feminine wiles. Walter, Guilo and Simpson enter the museum just before closing time, hide, and eventually make their way to the roof, where Simpson announces that he has a fear of heights. They manage to get across the roof anyway, and as soon as darkness falls Guilio is slipped in through a high window. The plan almost fails when Simpson lets the rope slip, but he recovers just in time. As planned, Guilio switches the daggers and the three depart the museum.The dagger is brought to the courier who will take it out of the country. It looks like everything has gone according to plan, but of course there is an unexpected twist at the end."

With mistaken identities and shipwrecks awash, it's a surprise any of them live to tell the tale!—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> There are four misfits aboard the HMS Venus, a frigate which is in service to fight the Spanish Armada. One is Albert Poop-Decker, newly minted as a midshipman by the Admiralty, who, in their desperation for men for service, passed him despite he being woefully unqualified in his naivety. While this service was to be his first as midshipman, he is mistakenly on board as a laborer due to two, Sally, a barmaid, who, in her own desperation to find a way to get to Spain to locate her love, Roger, has thus far successfully masqueraded as ""Midshipman Albert Poop-Decker"". Three is clueless cesspit cleaner Walter Sweetly, on board as a ""volunteer"" like the real Albert. And four is the captain himself, Fearless, who is less than so in finding any excuse not to enter into battle due to his delicate nature. Fearless' behavior doesn't sit well with two of his other officers, Lt. Jonathan Howett and Mr. Angel, the boatswain, who plot to relieve Fearless of his duties without it being considered an official mutiny. In Albert, Sally, Walter and Fearess' collective bumbling, and Albert and Sally falling in love with each other, they inadvertently change the nature of the situation and the status of the war with Spain.—Huggo On his way to Venus, his first ship, Albert Poop-Decker finds his Midshipman's uniform stolen by Sally in a Plymouth house of ill-repute. He then finds himself press-ganged onto Venus anyway, where Sally is indeed posing as the Midshipman. Silly Sally. Silly Navy.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Carry On Jack starts with the death of Admiral Horatio Nelson (Jimmy Thompson) whose last words are that Britain needs a bigger navy with more men, followed by his famous request for a kiss to Hardy (Anton Rodgers), upon which he meets his demise.

He is to join the frigate Venus at Plymouth. Arriving to find the crew all celebrating as they are sailing tomorrow, he takes a sedan chair with no bottom (so he must run), carried by a young man and his father (Jim Dale and Ian Wilson, respectively) to Dirty Dick's Tavern.Mobbed by women in the tavern as he is holding a sovereign aloft (as advised by Dale), he is rescued by serving maid, Sally (Juliet Mills). She wants to go to sea to find her shanghaied boyfriend Roger, but landlord Ned (George Woodbridge) has let her down. She finds that Poop-Decker has not reported to the ship yet and is unknown to them, so in a room upstairs she knocks him out and takes his midshipman's uniform.Poop-Decker wakes and dons a dress to cover his long johns, and downstairs, along with excreta pit cleaner named Walter Sweetly (Charles Hawtrey), is shanghaied by a press gang run by the Venus' First Officer Lieutenant Jonathan Howett (Donald Houston) and his officer in charge of the crew, Mr Angel (Percy Herbert).
They come to when at sea on the ship named Venus and are introduced to Captain Fearless (Kenneth Williams). Poop-Decker makes himself known but there is already a Midshipman Poop-Decker aboard - Sally, in disguise.

Sally reveals her identity to Poop-Decker after he has been punished, and he decides to let things continue as they are. Eventually, Poop-Decker and Sally fall in love with each other.After three months at sea and no action, the crew are very restless, and when they finally see a Spanish ship, the captain has them sail away from it. Howett in particular protests as he believes that the captain is running away from a fight.Howett and Angel hatch a plot, making it look like the ship has been boarded by the enemy during a night raid and using Poop-Decker as an expendable dupe to get the captain leave the ship on his own volition. Poop-Decker, Sweetly and Sally thus help the captain into a boat, and they leave the ship, but while leaving his cabin, the captain gets a splinter in his foot, which later goes gangrenous. When they reach dry land, Captain Fearless reckons that they are in France and they need only to walk a short distance to reach Calais, while they are standing on Spanish soil. Sally and Poop-Decker spot a party of civilians and steal their clothes while they are bathing.Now in charge of the ship, Howett and Angel sail for Cadiz and plan on taking it from Don Luis (Patrick Cargill), the Spanish Governor. They are successful, but their plot is ruined by Poop-Decker's group, who stumble into Cadiz (believing it to be Le Havre) and recapture the Venus. Sailing back to England, they encounter a pirate ship, whose crew seizes the Venus. The captain Patch (Peter Gilmore) turns out to be Sally's lost love Roger, but upon seeing him as a rough, brutal rogue, she no longer wants to have anything to do with him. In order to force her compliance, Patch and Hook (Ed Devereaux) try to make Poop-Decker and Fearless walk the plank, but Poop-Decker manages to escape and cut down a sail which covers the pirates, capturing them.In Cadiz, the former crew of the Venus are taken to be shot but escape with five empty Spanish Men of War to England for prize money and glory. They are within sight of England when they encounter the Venus. While Poop-Decker, Sally and Walter are working below decks on cutting off Fearless's badly infected leg, a fire gets out of control on deck and burns a sail which sets off the Venus' primed cannons, hitting all five Spanish ships and thus once again thwarting Howett's shot at fame and glory. Poop-Decker and his companions end up at the Admiralty as heroes. Fearless is promoted to Admiral and given a desk job. Poop-Decker and Sweetly are given the rank of honorary Captains, with pensions, but Poop-Decker reveals that he is going to leave the service to marry Sally."

Sakai is skeptical of the idea and is hesitant to ask the people of Infant Island for help since they failed to return the egg to Mothra and her people. Realizing they have no other option, Sakai, Junko, and Miura decide to head off to Infant Island to make a plea of their own.As they arrive on the island, they are captured by natives and brought to the tribe's chief.

The first attempt has air and ground forces lead Godzilla towards the lightning generators. But the monster manages to destroy the generators as the JSDF regroups. Back at the egg, the Shobijin sing a prayer as Sakai, Junko, and Miura wait for it to hatch. The JSDF make a final attempt to stop Godzilla by covering the beast in conductive nets and attempting to electrocute the monster to death. They almost succeed before a generator fails and Godzilla manages to free himself.Mothra's egg finally hatches, revealing two twin larvae. Godzilla makes his way towards Iwa Island, where a school teacher and her students have become trapped. Learning of this, Sakai and the others head on a boat to rescue the children as the Mothra larvae make their way to the island. Unable to defeat Godzilla with strength, the Mothra larvae use their wits and proceed to wrap Godzilla up in silk. With Godzilla distracted, Sakai, Junko, Miura, and Nakamura find and rescue the teacher and her students. The larvae manage to fully cocoon Godzilla as he plunges into the ocean.

Bey kneels before the mummy and offers himself as a sacrifice. The mummy breaks out of the net and crushes Bey's head with its foot before leaving without attacking anyone else, followed by the police. This proves to the Inspector and Bray that only those present at the opening of the sarcophagus are in danger, which still means Bray and Annette.At his house Beauchamp shows Annette his collection of Egyptian relics. Annette questions how he has his knowledge and Beauchamp reveals that he is Rameses's other son, cursed by Rameses to everlasting life, who can only die by the hand of his brother Ra who was killed by the assassins he sent. But now he has the chance for peace since he can die as Ra has returned to life. He places the medallion around Annette's neck and makes her repeat the words to awaken Ra's mummy. Before he can die he instructs Ra to kill Annette, the last of the tomb pillagers. Bray and the police burst in so Ra and Beauchamp take Annette into the underground tunnels. As they struggle with their pursuers to close the door behind them, Beauchamp's hand is trapped and severed as the door closes. However, Ra won't kill Annette because of her beauty. As Beauchamp takes out a knife to stab her himself, Ra stops him and forces him underwater, drowning him. The mummy leaves with the medallion and pulls down the roof of the tunnel on top of him, burying himself under a pile of stones and rocks, leaving Annette safe to be rescued by the police."

Lady Eloise Frinton, the Marchioness of Frinton (Jeanne Moreau) finds her own use for the vehicle, one which prompts her husband to sell the car in disgust. **Gangster Paolo Maltese's (George C.

When Paolo is called away to the U.S. to finish some ""business"", a bored Mae takes the Rolls-Royce on a spin through the country, enjoying both the sights and handsome Italian photographer Stefano (Alain Delon), who crosses her path. **By the outbreak of World War II, the car has come into the possession of socialite Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman). While on her way to visit Yugoslavian royalty, Gerda and the Rolls-Royce become (at first) unwitting and then (eventually) most willing participants in the Yugoslavian fight.—A.L.Beneteau <albl@inforamp.net> Three stories of love-hurt linked only by a yellow Rolls-Royce. Lord Charles Frinton, The Marquess of Frinton (Sir Rex Harrison), an aristocrat and diplomatic official of the British Foreign and Colonial Office in the days of the British Empire, buys a brand-new yellow Phantom model as a belated anniversary gift for his wife Lady Eloise Frinton, the Marchioness of Frinton (Jeanne Moreau). They attend the ultrafashionable Ascot horse races, a socialite event never missed by the royal family, where the Marquess has a horse competing; it wins a cup, but his pride tastes bitter when he finds Eloise committing infidelity in the Rolls-Royce with an assistant of his, without either knowing if there is actual love between them. For appearances' sake, they agree as a modus vivendi to pretend nothing has changed. The cuckolded diplomat can no longer bear to look at the Rolls-Royce, so it's sold and shipped to the Italian Riviera where, allegedly after a maharajah who lost it again in Monte Carlo casino, American mafioso Paolo Maltese (George C. Scott) buys it, eager to show his ancestral country to his spoiled, slutty fiancée Mae Jenkins (Shirley MacLaine), who appreciates nothing Italian and only starts having fun after they meet young Stefano (Alain Delon), an attractive young guide-photographer, who proves himself as an entertaining flirt. When Paolo must return for a few days to Miami for business, he leaves Mae to continue the tour, for which she couldn't care less, nor the old Lieutenant Joey Friedlander (Art Carney) left to chaperon her, so they are both bored, take a spin to the Amalfi coast, and in Soriano bump into Stefano again, who this time gets to entertain and seduce Mae, and during a swim takes her diving to a mythological nymph's grotto, where Stefano finally learns who his dangerous rival is, yet they finally kiss--silently noted by Joey--but she dreads Paolo's return and just in time decides to dump her lover rather than risk a bloodbath.

As Lord Charles focuses on the activities around the race and his diplomatic duties, he's not aware of Lady Eloise's own activities. which might make the anniverary and the gift memorable in the wrong way. Over 2,000 miles (over 3,200 kilometers) later, world-renowned American gangster Paolo Maltese (George C. Scott) buys the Rolls-Royce for his fiancée Mae Jenkins (Shirley MacLaine), in which to travel around Italy. On their travels they meet street photographer Stefano (Alain Delon), who flirts with Mae--harmlessly enough, Paolo believes. Mae calls Stefano amoral for flirting with her, an engaged woman, but she falls for him and he falls in love with her. Paolo is called back to the U.S. to deal with business, Mae and Stefano are able to spend time together, and she wonders if she loves him enough to leave him, since Paolo would never let her go, and his right-hand man Joey Friedlander (Art Carney), who saw what happened between Mae and Stefano, must decide if he will rat them out to Paolo for his own self-preservation. The car, having seen better days, in 1941 comes under the ownership of middle-aged American socialite Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman), an overbearing, headstrong woman who always gets her way--or else--and is oblivious to world activities outside of her general sphere. In Trieste she plans to travel to Yugoslavia to meet with the new Prince, Peter, and Yugoslavian national Davich (Omar Sharif) persuades her to give him a ride to his homeland; only when they approach the border does she learn that he is a Yugoslavian revolutionary who, despite her earlier concern, isn't about to kill Prince Peter, but to work to defeat what he and his colleagues know will be the imminent Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia. Beyond the issue of getting Davich over the border without being detected by border control, Mrs. Millett might see first-hand what he's fighting for if they do get across.—Huggo"

Worried that their children have become obsessed with television shows from Earth which extol the virtues of Santa Claus, Martians begin an expedition to Earth to kidnap the one and only Santa Claus. While on Earth, they kidnap two lively children that lead the group of Martians to the North Pole and Santa Claus. The Martians then take Santa Claus and the two children back to Mars with them. Voldar, a particularly grumpy Martian, attempts to do away with the children and Santa Claus before they get to Mars, but their leader Lord Kimar stops him. When they arrive on Mars, Santa Claus, with the help of the two Earth children and a rather simple-minded Martian lackey, overcomes the Martians by bringing fun, happiness and Christmas cheer to the children of Mars.—<srm12@ksu.ksu.edu> After finding that the children of the planet Mars are lethargic from watching Earth based television programming, lately secular Christmas news items specifically around Santa Claus (it being the approach to the Christmas season on Earth) and after consulting with one of their elders about what to do, Martians decide to kidnap Santa Claus, knowing nothing about him, and bring him back to Mars to do whatever Santa Claus does. Needing to sift through the plethora of Salvation Army and shopping mall Santa Clauses on Earth, they ultimately are able to kidnap the real Santa Claus. Santa Claus' disappearance may threaten Christmas on Earth. The first problem the Martians encounter back on Mars is that, out of circumstance, they also have to kidnap two innocent adolescent Earthlings, brother and sister Billy and Betty Foster. The Martians, led by Lord Kimar and ultimately his wife Lady Momar, don't want any harm to Santa Claus or the Foster children, but only want the Martian children to be happy, which may mean keeping the three Earthlings on Mars forever. However, there is an opposing Martian faction led by Voldar, who don't want Santa Claus on Mars and will do anything needed to get rid of Santa Claus. What happens between these two opposing factions may be affected by yet another Martian, Dropo, who is a large child is a large Martian's body. If Santa Claus, and Billy and Betty are able to survive this situation, is there anything they can do to convince the Martians to send them back to Earth so that Earth children can have a Merry Christmas?—Huggo On the planet Mars, the Martian supreme leader Lord Kimar notices a listlessness that seems to be taking ahold of the children of Mars. This is clearly evident when he finds his own children (Bomar and Girmar) spending much time watching Earth based programs on the videoscope. Kimar's wife, Lady Momar, suggests that he seek advice from Chochem, the Ancient One.Lord Kimar gathers a number of other Martians and goes to see the 800-year-old sage Chochem. Though it is the middle of Septober on Mars, Chochem explains that on Earth, it is drawing closer to Christmas, and this could explain why the children of Mars are behaving so strangely. Chochem then goes on to decry how Mars tends immediately work on educating their young, giving no time for play or fun. Chochem finally decrees that the children must have fun, and says that Mars needs a Santa Claus, just as Earth has.Lord Kimar soon takes Chochem's words to heart, and assembles a crew to go to Earth to capture Santa Claus. Of the crew, almost everyone is in agreement except for Voldar, who reluctantly comes along, even though he feels this is a mistake. Observing the Earth, the men are shocked to find that there seem to be hundreds of Santas, many of whom are standing on corners ringing bells. Kimar believes that once they capture the real Santa, they then won't have any trouble with hundreds of Santas running around.Setting down near a small lake, the Martians meet two children named Billy and Betty. After explaining what they saw, Billy informs the Martians that the ones they saw were Santa's helpers, and that the real Santa lives at the North Pole. The Martians then take the two children with them, to prevent them from informing the authorities. On the Martian spaceship, Billy and Betty are supervised by a clumsy Martian named Dropo. After sneaking them onto the ship's bridge, Dropo quickly hides the two in the radar box before Voldar enters onto the bridge.As the ship lands at the North Pole, the two children overhear the Martians planning to kidnap Santa Claus, and also take the two of them to Mars. After the Martians leave the ship, Billy and Betty escape, planning to get to Santa first to warn him. However, before they can get far, they encounter a polar bear, and then a robot named Torg, who captures them. The children are returned to the ship shortly thereafter.Torg and the Martians then head to Santa's workshop. Upon finding others there, Voldar and another Martian use a freeze-ray weapon, that stops several elves and Mrs. Claus in their tracks. Kimar assures Santa the effect will wear off in a few hours, before taking Santa with them. Sometime afterward, Mrs. Claus unfreezes, and alerts the media. The United Nations and the Space Program then immediately decide to send a rescue ship to attempt and capture the Martians, but it's too late as the ship is too far away.On the Martians' spaceship, Santa's jolly spirit infects many of the crew, but Voldar finds the entire cheeriness ridiculous, and attempts to shoot Santa and the children out of the ship's airlock. Voldar is then captured and locked in a cell. Though right after the ship lands, several other Martians instead find Dropo in the cell, and find Voldar has escaped the ship entirely. Kimar orders Santa and the Earth children to have a constant guard, certain that Voldar will attempt something else.Santa, Billy and Betty are then brought to meet Bomar and Gimar. Upon meeting Santa, he incites the children into laughter...something that Kimar and Momar have never heard before. After his greeting, Santa requests that a toy factory be built immediately, as he then plans to head back to Earth. It is then that Kimar explains that Santa will not be returning to Earth, and that he now belongs to Mars.Meanwhile, Voldar has taken into hiding in some caves along Mars' Transverse Canal. He is assisted by a nervous Martian named Stobo, and another named Shim. Shim works as a double-agent, investigating Santa's toy factory. Voldar's original plan to shoot Santa is dismissed in favor of an attempt to find a way to discredit him.Meanwhile, Bomar, Gimar, Billy and Betty assist Santa on working in the toy factory. Momar even makes Santa an extra suit (and fake beard to go with it). Dropo asks to wear it, which is meant with a jovial laugh by Santa, who claims the Martian would need to fatten up first. Back at Kimar's home, Bomar and Gimar have grown much happier, but Billy and Betty have begun to seem sullen, much the way that Bomar and Gimar once were. Momar explains to Kimar that the two should be returned to Earth, but he refuses.Meanwhile, Dropo has gotten ahold of Santa's extra suit and beard, and after using a pillow, happily decides to go down to the workshop. Unknown to him, Voldar, Stobo and Shim have arrived there, and attempt to sabotage the machine. As they complete their work, they see Dropo enter, and mistake him for Santa (even though his face and hands are green). Dropo is taken back to Voldar's lair, but every question he is asked, is answered with Santa's famous 'ho ho ho'.When Santa and the children return to the factory to make more toys, they discovered that someone has tampered with the machines. Voldar and Stobo return to the factory to make a deal with Kimar, but when they see the real Santa Claus, they realize that their plan has been foiled. Held hostage in the cave, Dropo tricks his guard Shim and escapes. Kimar then arrests Voldar, Stobo and Shim. Santa notices that Dropo behaves like him, and says that Dropo would make a good Santa Claus on Mars. Kimar agrees and sends Santa and the children back to Earth."

The 7th Dawn,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057813/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Political and personal intrigues surround a group of characters in Malaya, after the close of the Second World War. The end of WWII finds Major Ferris fighting alongside guerrilla groups in the jungles of Malaysia. Major Ferris is an American who was attached to the Australian 8th Army and stayed behind to co-ordinate native guerrilla groups. When the Japanese unconditionally surrender, everyone is rejoicing, but a British officer pertinently comments that although the Malaysian people aided the British to defeat the Japanese their allegiance will shift and they might not be so friendly towards the British in the near future. Malaysia is a British colony and like many other colonies it struggles to gain its independence from the European powers. Major Ferris' closest friend and comrade during the war, Malaysian colonel Ng, is asked by Ferris to join him into a business venture. Ferris has purchased a few acres of land rich in rubber trees and tin mines. He offers Ng an equal partnership in the venture but colonel Ng refuses. He explains that he has to go to Moscow to study at a school for political cadre. The two friends part ways. Eight years later, the British already have major problems in Malaysia. Many guerrilla groups openly attack the British army convoys, kill British officers, raid local plantations and businesses, rob the payroll of local companies, kidnap the European colonists and destroy British colonial property in the region. The British government is negotiating a peaceful withdrawal of British colonial forces from Malaysia promising total independence to the country. But the guerrilla leaders do not trust the word of the British, so they continue the guerrilla war against the colonial authorities. Many European colonists, plantation and business owners, sell their companies and assets and leave Malaysia. The only one not concerned by the violent events surrounding him is Major Ferris. His plantations and tin mines are not attacked by the rebels. When he drives in his convertible on local roads, the guerrilla groups laying in ambush do not harm him. One day, the English-language local newspapers, quoting a Soviet propaganda newspaper, indicate that former Malaysian guerrilla leader, colonel Ng, has returned from Moscow to co-ordinate all guerrilla groups in Malaysia. The chief of police and the British Army commander in the region arrive at Major Ferris' house to confirm the fact that during the war, Ferris worked closely with Ng against the Japanese forces. When Ferris confirms the fact, the two British officials ask him to go into the jungle and contact Ng with a message from the British. They want to convey to the guerrilla leader that the British have sincere intentions of withdrawing from Malaysia and allowing the country to become fully independent. They also want the guerrillas to cease their attacks on the British military and the colonists in order to allow them time to organize their departure from Malaysia. The officials hope that Major Ferris can persuade Ng and the rebel guerrillas to co-operate. A few days later, Ferris sneaks into the jungle, alone, in search of his old war buddy, colonel Ng.—nufs68 A World War II veteran stays behind in Malaya to fight off Communist insurgents."

Having failed to spot any UFOs, they accuse Naoko of being a non believer and the reason why they haven't spotted anything. As Naoko inquires further, the head of the club comments on how many strange phenomena have been occurring across the globe and is concerned something terrible might happen to the Earth. They are interrupted by a meteor shower as Naoko's brother, Detective Shindo, also witnesses the phenomena. Shindo is then given an assignment by his chief of police. He is to act as a bodyguard for the princess of the small kingdom of Selgina, Maas Doulina Salno. Salno is en route to Japan to escape political opposition that seeks to assassinate her. However as her plane flies to Japan, Salno becomes possessed by a mysterious voice and jumps out of the plane, which is subsequently blown up by a bomb. The night ends with a large meteor landing in Kurobe Valley.The following day, Professor Murai and his team arrive near Kurobe Dam and set out to investigate the meteor that crashed the night before. As the group hikes through the mountains, they notice that all their compasses have started to malfunction. When they reach the meteor, they are surprised to observe it emitting a powerful magnetic force.Shindo inquires with his chief about Salno, only to be told that she was assassinated before she could arrive in Japan. Elsewhere, Naoko is alerted about a mysterious prophetess who is making an ominous prediction of Earth's destruction. Naoko arrives on the scene and attempts to ask the prophetess where she is from. She claims to be from Venus and warns that the Earth's end will begin with a strange event on Mount Aso. Despite her warnings, most people scoff at her claims. Later that night, Shindo arrives at his mother's house and notices Naoko being dropped off by Professor Murai. Inside, Naoko, Shindo, and their mother, tune into the ""Where Are They Now"" TV show. On the program the Shobijin, Mothra's fairies, introduce themselves to the audience. Lamenting the death of one of the twin larvae, the fairies sing a melody as Shindo turns to a newspaper.

Salno's assassin, Malmess, is sent to Japan to finish the job, or he himself will be killed.Back in Japan, Naoko is instructed to follow Salno while Shindo asks his chief to let him pursue the case.

As Murai discusses his findings with the two, they see a news report that shows the prophetess speaking at Mt. Aso. Salno warns the crowds that volcanic gases will resurrect Rodan. As her warnings fall on deaf ears, Rodan emerges from the crater and takes flight as the crowds flea. The assassins arrive in Japan while Professor Murai is back in Kurobe and notices that the meteor appears to be growing.Salno reappears at a port where the Shobijin prepare to board a ship back to Infant Island. As Salno warns that the ship must not sail, she is approached by Naoko and is invited to join her at a hotel. Malmess and the other assassins follow the two women. As Naoko discusses with Salno, they discover that the Shobjin have heeded Salno's warnings and did not board the ship. It is soon revealed that Godzilla has reemerged and destroyed the ship.Back at the hotel, Naoko gives Salno a change of clothes and steps out of the room to meet her brother in the lobby. Malmess and his men take the opportunity to enter the room and verify that the prophetess is the princess. As Malmess pulls out a knife and is about to kill Salno, the Shobijin cut the lights and warn Shindo and Naoko. Shindo opens fire on the assassins and chases them off. The two make sure that Salno is safe when they hear a large explosion coming from the harbor. Godzilla has entered Yokohama and spots Rodan in the sky. Infuriated, Godzilla proceeds to chase Rodan across Japan.The next day, Shindo brings Salno to the laboratory of Dr. Tsukamoto, a brilliant psychiatrist who attempts to diagnose the princess. The treatments however seem to be ineffective as Salno still claims to be from Venus and makes one final prediction. The Earth will meet its end with the arrival of King Ghidorah, a powerful space monster who completely annihilated the civilization on Venus. Salno claims Venusian heritage and explains how a few of them survived and assimilated amongst humanity while still retaining some of their abilities.Godzilla has followed Rodan to Mount Fuji, where the two monsters continue to bicker with each other. Back in Kurobe, Murai and his team notice strange activity from the meteor. Suddenly, the meteor splits open and an explosion of flames bursts into the sky. The flames materialize into the golden three-headed dragon, King Ghidorah.With Godzilla, Rodan, and King Ghidorah loose in Japan, the government assembles an emergency meeting at the National Diet Building. Naoko and Murai arrive with the Shobijin and propose a plan to ask Mothra to help defend the world from King Ghidorah. While the Shobijin wish to help, they fear that the Mothra larva will be unable to defeat King Ghidorah. Their only hope is to have Mothra persuade Godzilla and Rodan to set aside their differences and join forces to help save the world from the space monster. Just then, Ghidorah flies over Tokyo and causes great damage with his gravity beams. The assembly beg for the Shobijin's help. They oblige and pray on Mothra to arrive from Infant Island.Back at Dr. Tsukamoto's laboratory, the doctor prepares to administer Salno electroshock therapy. Tsukamoto instructs Shindo to set the voltage to 500 volts. However, Malmess and the other assassins sneak in to the lab an set the voltage level to a lethal three thousand volts. Just before the electrical shock can be administered, Rodan lifts Godzilla into the air and drops him onto a power pylon, knocking out the power and unintentionally saving Salno. Malmess and his men burst into the lab and get into a shoot out with Shindo. Naoko and Murai arrive to the sound of gunfire as Shindo chases off the assassins. As Godzilla and Rodan continue to squabble with one another, Naoko and Murai join up with Shindo, Dr. Tsukamoto, and Salno. The group drives off as Mothra arrives to the base of Mount Fuji. They exit their car and climb up a hill where they witness Mothra break up the fight and attempt to talk to Godzilla and Rodan. The fairies translate as Mothra attempts to persuade the monsters to join forces and save the Earth from King Ghidorah. However, Godzilla and Rodan refuse, saying that it's none of their concern. Godzilla says they have no reason to help humanity as humans have always bullied then. To which Rodan agrees.The assassins make their way through the mountain roads when they are caught in a landslide caused by Ghidorah. Their car is crushed with all the assassins, except for Malmess, killed. As Mothra continues her conversation, Shindo and the rest decide to head to safety and move to higher ground. Mothra pleads with the monsters, arguing that the Earth doesn't just belong to humanity, it is theirs too and they should defend it. However, Godzilla and Rodan fail to agree and Mothra is forced to head out and confront Ghidorah all by herself.Ghidorah quickly overpowers Mothra, and is repeatedly blasted by the space monster's gravity beams. Inspired by the larva's courage, Godzilla and Rodan finally decide to join Mothra in the battle against King Ghidorah. As the monsters of Earth struggle against Ghidorah, Shindo notices that Salno has disappeared. The group splits up to search for her when Malmess discovers her praying in a gorge. Malmess proceeds to open fire on the princess when Shindo arrives to save her. Salno collapses further into the gorge as Shindo descends to reach her. As Malmess reloads, Salno comes to her senses and recognizes him as a traitor. Shindo pulls Salno aside to defend her, but he shot and disarmed by Malmess. Just as the assassin is about to kill them, a blast from King Ghidorah's beams strikes the mountain and causes a landslide that sends Malmess plummeting to his death. Tsukamoto and the others soon arrive to help take the injured Shindo and princess to safety.The Earth's monsters continue to battle Ghidorah and use their distinct abilities in a collective effort to take the upper hand against the space dragon. Godzilla takes the brunt of Ghidorah's attacks as Rodan lifts Mothra in the air to cocoon the dragon in silk. Battered, King Ghidorah proceeds to take flight and flee as Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra emerge victorious.With the Earth safe, Shindo, Naoko, Murai, and Tsukamoto, arrive at an airport to bid Princess Salno farewell. Salno asks Tsukamoto how she regained her memory, to which he replies it must have been the shock of being grazed by a bullet that caused her to regain consciousness. She then wonders if her abilities will ever return, with Tsukamoto responding that such matters are beyond our understanding. Salno approaches Shindo and thanks him for saving her life three times. Shindo asks how she can remember, with Salno responding she is only able to recall the moments he saved her life. Salno expresses her gratitude and assures Shindo that she will never forget him, with Shindo wishing her a prosperous life and bidding her farewell. As Salno's plane returns to her kingdom, Godzilla and Rodan watch from afar as Mothra and the Shobijin head back to Infant Island."

Although the evidence appears to be overwhelming in the strangulation murder of a blackmailer, Miss Jane Marple's (Dame Margaret Rutherford's) sole ""not guilty"" vote hangs the jury 11-1. She becomes convinced that the real murderer is a member of a local theatrical troupe, so she joins them in order to gather information. The clues lead back many years to a single disastrously unsuccessful 1951 performance of a dreadful play written by the group's hammy director, H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody). Although at that time, several of the current cast members were only children, more murders follow before Miss Marple ultimately exposes the killer.—duke1029 After being the only holdout in a jury that was ready to convict a man of killing his fellow lodger, Mrs. McGuinty, Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) sets out to find the real killer. She finds that the dead woman had a particular interest in a theater company, the Cosgood Players, run by H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody). She no sooner manages to get an unpaid position with the company than one of the actors, George Rowton (Maurice Good), is poisoned and dies minutes before a performance. Miss Marple is certain that it's the same person responsible for both murders and when another member of the company is killed, Miss Marple is convinced that it she who was the intended victim.—garykmcd During the trial of the prime suspect of the murder of Mrs. McGinty, Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) is the only member of the jury that believes that the accused is innocent. The judge schedules another trial and Miss Marple invites her friend Jim Stringer (Stringer Davis) to go to the house of the victim to talk with her sister and snoop around. Miss Marple discovers that Mrs. McGinty was an actress and she joins the theatrical company of H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody) to investigate and find the real killer. But soon people around her dies and Inspector Craddock (Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell) and Mr. Stringer are worried about her safety.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film opens with a droll series of silent bits as a constable at night on his bicycle discovers a man with his hands on a rope with a strangled woman -- Margaret McGinty -- attached. As it happens Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) is on the jury in the succeeding murder trial. She forces a mistrial as the only one to hold out in a seemingly open and shut case because she views the evidence as circumstantial. She then enlists the aid of her friend Mr. Stringer (Stringer Davis, Rutherford's actual husband) to follow the evidence in support of her theory to find the real murderer. She is harassed by Detective Inspector Craddock (Charles ""Bud"" Tingwell) who wants her to get out of the way of the Police. She traces the evidence to a low-rent theatre troupe run by H. Driffold Cosgood (Ron Moody), and manages to infiltrate the acting company with a whirling rendition of The Shooting of Dan McGrew, and intimating that she may be willing to financially subsidize the company.No sooner does she secure a place as an actress, than one of the actors, George, drops dead from poisoning and Detective Inspector Craddock shows up again to try to get her to give up her hunt, but does also work with her to discover the killer. She suggests that Craddock investigate bank accounts of all the actors to see who, if any, recently withdrew 100 pounds -- the amount of cash found surrounding the body of Mrs. McGinty and now believed to be a pay off for black mail. Back at the boarding house where all the actors are staying, Miss Marple continues to ferret out clues and finds a note outside her door telling her to meet someone at 1AM in the kitchen if she wants to find out more. As she is sneaking down the stairs, she sees middle-aged actress Dorothy sneaking down just ahead of her and follows. When she opens the closed kitchen door, Dorothy is dead on the floor and Mrs. Marple, smelling bitter almonds indicating cyanide, throws open the outside door and windows. When the inspector arrives, she explains that the murder was done in a complicated way involving an on/off stove timer, a pot containing candle wax and a cyanide capsule but says this was the murder method of the play that they are opening with the following week (""Out of the Stewpot""), so all the actors would know how to do this. Meanwhile, Mr. Stringer arrives and tells her that the police have learned that one of the actors DID withdraw 100 pounds recently, but it was the recently-murdered George. Inspector Craddock theorizes that George had been blackmailing Margaret McGinty, which is why he withdrew the 100 pounds from his account, and then, in a fit of remorse, killed himself, but Mrs. Marple thinks otherwise.Mrs. Marple visits a theatrical agent who tells her that Margaret McGinty was in a 1951 play, ""Forever September"", written by Mr. Cosgood, along with a Rose Kane, who had a child about eleven. The agent says that Rose Kane was hanged for poisoning her husband, and Margaret McGinty, took the child in for awhile but that eventually it was sent on to an orphanage. He can't remember the sex of the child, but does recall the name, ""Evelyn"" pronounced ""EEvelyn"". This child would now be about the age of the four younger members of the acting troupe, Eva, Bill, Sheila, and Arthur.As the play opens the next week, the police are on hand to protect Mrs. Marple, but Eva comes into her dressing room with a knife and together they go below stage where Mrs. Marple learns that Eva thinks that Mrs. Marple was involved in killing George, who, it turns out, was her lover. Just as Mrs. Marple talks Eva out of her ill-conceived murder plan, the real murderer comes out of the shadows causing Eva to drop her knife and run away in fear. The shadowy figure is revealed to be Bill Hanson. Bill explains that in the play he is in a closet and he has used the stage trap door to come down and will be able to murder Mrs. Marple, and return to his closet before his scene takes place in 3 minutes. Bill, is actually Evelyn Kane, and he murdered Margaret McGinty because she was going to reveal to his soon-to-be father-in-law Bill's mother's sordid past. He picks up Eva's knife (he had intended to strangle Mrs. Marple) but Mrs. Marple draws the revolver that is to be used in the play (she had replaced it with a banana), and points it at Bill explaining she has replaced the blanks with real ammunition. She announces she was a former pistol champion at Bisley but he still advances on her so she shoots in two a prop rope causing a heavy wooden wheel to fall and knock out Bill, but also Inspector Craddock who had rushed downstairs. At the same time, Mr. Cosgood steps into the open stage door and comes crashing down. As she looks around at the three unconscious men, she says ""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear"". The movie ends with her visiting Cosgood and Inspector Craddock in hospital, where he announced he has been promoted to Chief Inspector. Cosgood tries to get her to fund his play, but she says that she is ""no angel"". Mr. Stringer picks her up in a horse-drawn cart and they ride away."

There are gadgets galore, and disguises are compulsory if the heroes are to win the day from The Fat Man, Dr Milchman and Dr Crow!—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> The evil Dr. Crow, head of the subversive organization the Society for the Total Extinction of Non-Conforming Humans or STENCH, has let the British Secret Service know that he was the one who masterminded the theft of the top secret formula for hydroformulin developed for the War Department by Dr. Stark, who was killed in the process. Dr. Crow has also let them know that the formula, stolen by one of his agents named Milchmann (translated as Milkman), will imminently deliver the formula to him. British Secret Service has to retrieve the formula, and the Chief is dismayed to learn the only agent available for the job is bumbling Simkins (code name Red Admiral). As such, Chief assigns a team of trainees, Harold Crump (code name Blue Bottle), Daphne Honeybutt (code name Brown Cow), and Charlie Bind (code name Yellow Peril) not so much to work under Simkins but to ensure he doesn't cause any problems. The real problem ends up being that the four as a collective, largely in their inexperience, are as inept as Simkins, with the one exception of Honeybutt's inherent skill of a photographic memory. That problem is only exacerbated by Crump falling in love with Honeybutt, he doing whatever to protect her over all else. They are dispatched to Vienna upon news from the Service's man there, Carstairs, that Milchmann has just arrived in town. The foursome get into one scrape after another in their ineptitude, much to the chagrin of Carstairs who arguably could have retrieved the formula on his own if it wasn't for the four.—Huggo A top-secret chemical formula has been stolen by STENCH (the Society for the Total Extinction of Non-Conforming Humans).

Meanwhile Dr Crow instructs his henchman, The Fat Man (Eric Pohlmann) to kill Milchmann and to retrieve the formula from him.

All set in the rigid atmosphere of a Jesuit-run school. THIS SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP tells of the tender relationship between a twelve-year-old boy and the upperclass man who is the object of his desire. All set in the rigid atmosphere of a Jesuit-run school.—Jim Stark Les amitiés particulières is a 1964 film adaptation of the Roger Peyrefitte novel Les amitiés particulières directed by Jean Delannoy. It stars Francis Lacombrade as Georges, Didier Haudepin as Alexandre and Michel Bouquet as Père de Trennes. It was released in English as This Special Friendship.—yusufpiskin ""Special friendships"" are youthful relationships with homoerotic overtones, and this film explores them in the setting of a strict French Roman Catholic boys' boarding school in the 1920s. The faculty are ever alert, depriving the students of all privacy. When a vulnerable fifteen-year old boy, motivated variously by jealousy, subservience and fear, or genuine good intentions, co-operates with his teachers' campaigns to repress all suggestion of romance or impropriety in his own and others' friendships, he betrays everyone most important to him. Based on the novel ""Les Amities Particulieres"" by Roger Peyrefitte.—Paul Emmons <pemmons@wcupa.edu> WARNING - contains spoiler (end of film is revealed) The screenplay is based on the novel written in 1943 by Roger Peyrefitte (1907-2000) ""Les Amitiés particulières"" (Particular Friendships -- a term used in seminaries to refer to romantic friendships between affection-starved adolescent boys seen as too close and exclusive, often less happily translated as ""Special Friendships""), which won the coveted prix Renaudot in 1945. Peyrefitte went to Jesuit and Lazarist boarding schools in the 1920s and the plot is understood to be largely autobiographical, with de Sarre being Peyrefitte's alter ego in the book. As in the book, Peyrefitte had a relationship with a younger student at a Catholic boarding school and as in the book, his love interest eventually committed suicide.The plot revolves around Georges, the fourteen-year-old son of the Marquis de Sarre, who is sent to a Catholic boarding school in France between the wars. Getting to know the other boys, he is immediately interested in the amiable Lucien Rouvère, against whom he is warned by the unsympathetic Marc de Blajan, who cryptically informs him that some of the students ""may seem all right, but are in fact not"". Georges is dismayed when he learns that Lucien already has a close friendship with the slightly older André Ferron - they have exchanged blood and so are ""united forever"". He befriends Lucien, but filled with envy, tries to destroy his relationship with André, eventually succeeding in getting André expelled by leaving a poem about remembered kisses (which disturbs him when he reads it), written for Rouvère and signed by Ferron, where the Father Superior would find it. An action Georges almost immediately regrets.When his advances towards Lucien remain fruitless, Georges starts a ""particular friendship"", with a 12½-year-old student, the beautiful Alexandre Motier, who soon becomes the more fervid of the pair. The priests who lead the school disapprove of these relationships, especially between boys of different ages, even though they do not go beyond a few kisses and love poems, with no sexual element, believing that sensibility inevitably leads to sensuality.Despite their air of condemnation of these friendships, some of the priests harbour sexual feelings for the boys. One of them, the Graecophile Father de Trennes, likes to invite boys to join him in his room at night for a few drinks and cigarettes. Georges fears that Father de Trennes suspects his relationship with Alexandre and is about to become his Confessor, so he gets the priest dismissed by causing the Father Superior to investigate the sleeping dormitory, where he finds de Trennes in his room drinking with a pupil. However, Father Lauzon, who is a friend of Alexandre's family and as the boy's Confessor wants to protect him, discovers their relationship when he finds Georges & Alexandre laughing & smoking cigarettes together in a shed in the college grounds. He has separate interviews with the two boys & Georges says that he alone is responsible for their friendship, adding ""My evil thoughts left me as soon as I knew him."" But Alexandre is defiant and tells Lauzon: ""Georges and I are one person. . .We are going to be friends forever."" The priest demands of Georges that he ends the friendship immediately and talks him into giving back the ""love"" letters from Alexandre, which would mean that the relationship was over. Lauzon believes that he is rescuing the younger boy from Satan's clutches, but he then deliberately deceives Alexandre into believing that Georges did not feel the same way about him & regrets their particular friendship, setting in train the ensuing tragedy. He counters Alexandres disbelief by handing him the returned letters in an envelope addressed to him in Georges' hand. Unfortunately, Alexandre cannot see that Georges was forced to do this and that his feelings for him are actually unchanged and he commits suicide before he can receive the letter of explanation which Lucien has urged Georges to write.When Georges is visited at his family home by Lauzon he tells the priest that he does not believe Alexandres' death was an accident. He says he should never have surrendered Alexandres' letters - he did not love him enough. Lauzon gives Georges a photograph of Alexandre blissfully asleep in a chair and Georges in return gives him the letter he had written to Alexandre before he knew of his death. In it he explains the reason for his apparent betrayal and asks Alexandre to have faith in him, declaring that their friendship is love. In a final address he declares ""you are the boy I am; you breathe in me. . . it is for you that I live my whole life."" He has become Alexandre Motier in his soul.The later exploits of Georges de Sarre, when he is a diplomat at the French embassy in Athens (like the author) are narrated in the 1951 novel ""Les Ambassades"" (English translation 1953 as ""Diplomatic Diversions""). In it he recalls the events at St Claude's, setting them between October 1926 and July 1927, although the exact dates are not given in either the first book or the film itself."

A group of friends go to Hawaii in order to practice surfing, their favorite sport. But this is not all they do there - they also find love...—Volker Boehm Many of the best surfers head to Hawaii for the two weeks around Christmas as it is considered the time of the biggest waves on the islands, especially at Waimea Bay. Among those that have descended here this year, which promises to have even bigger waves than usual due to an approaching storm, are Malibu based friends Jody Wallis, Chase Colton and Ralph ""Steamer"" Lane, who know they will be challenged by the Hawaiian surf, let alone those at Waimea Bay. Before the big surf hits Waimea, they meet up with other surfers at nearby beaches. They find that there is competitive mentality among the surfers, not only on who is the best surfer, but who has the greatest overall bravado. The competition is sometimes friendly and sometimes not so friendly. The biggest competition is to become king of Waimea, which requires not only surfing skill but moxie. Although they didn't come in search of it, they also find romance. Steamer, for who surfing is only a casual past-time while he works his way through life, is attracted to Lily Kilua, an islander. They have to hide the fact of him being a surfer from her protective mother, who believes surfers are nothing but trouble, much like Lily's absent father. Wealthy Chase, who always takes the most traditional path, hooks up with Augusta Poole, a mainlander visiting for Christmas. Their relationship is despite their less than friendly initial meeting. Augie's adventurous mentality is the exact opposite of Chase's, the two who will have to find the right balance. And Jody, the best surfer of the three who considers himself a full time surfer in part because he is running away from everything else in life, hooks up with Augie's friend, the staid Brie Matthews. Brie tries to instill a sense of responsibility into Jody's life path.—Huggo"

Meanwhile, Laurel's mother Olivia (Elizabeth Sellars) tries to get her back.—Nasser <NasKU@aol.com> Sixteen-year-old Laurel (Hayley Mills) has been the ward of her wealthy maternal grandmother, Mrs. St. Maugham (Dame Edith Evans), for four years, since Mrs. St. Maugham's estranged daughter, Laurel's mother Olivia (Elizabeth Sellars), re-married. Laurel's father has since passed. Laurel, who has not seen or heard from her mother since, believes her mother deserted her and her father. As such, Laurel has grown into a rebellious and rambunctious teenager, her actions and words, such as her threat to burn down the house, meant to shock and provoke. Because of her behavior, Laurel has had a series of governesses who she has been able to scare off, some upon first meeting. The latest governess that Mrs. St. Maugham hires is Miss Madrigal (Deborah Kerr), despite Miss Madrigal having no references and admitting that she has never done such work before. Conversely, Miss Madrigal feels compelled to this job, Laurel, who Miss Madrigal believes she can help, unable to scare her off upon her job interview.

No one has ever stayed long because Laurel runs them off with her bizarre behavior. Miss Madrigal is hardly the ideal candidate as she lacks references and has never been a governess. But when she reveals that she knows a lot about gardens, Mrs. St. Maugham takes her on.Laurel notices that Miss Madrigal's clothing is all new and some of it still has price tags attached. Her room also lacks pictures of family and friends. Miss Madrigal is determined to get the upper hand, sensing that Laurel's behavior stems from a traumatic past. Maitland, the family butler, befriends Miss Madrigal and warns her to keep her door locked.Every night Laurel lights a bonfire in the garden and runs around it screaming. Mrs. St. Maugham explains that they are curing her of this by making the pile of wood smaller every time. Laurel also regularly threatens to burn down the house. She is determined to find out what Miss Madrigal is hiding, as the governess refuses to reveal anything about her past.Laurel lies about nearly everything and Miss Madrigal must sort out what is truth and what is fiction. It is evident that the girl hates her mother, Olivia, who is Mrs. St. Maugham's estranged daughter. There was a scandal when Olivia ran off with her lover, abandoning her husband and Laurel. Laurel claims that her father was so despondent that he shot himself to death in front of her. Maitland later refutes this. Laurel's father died of a liver ailment caused by too much drinking.Another of Laurel's stories involve a man who supposedly attacked her in Hyde Park shortly before her mother's marriage. Maitland explains that no one really knows what happened. Mrs. St. Maugham wouldn't allow Laurel to be examined by a doctor or questioned by the police. As far as Mrs. St. Maugham is concerned, Olivia abandoned her daughter and is an unfit mother.Slowly Miss Madrigal begins to gain Laurel's trust. They go sketching and play tennis. Miss Madrigal learns to ignore her charge's bizarre stories. Then a telegram comes from Olivia. She intends to pay her mother a visit and wants to see Laurel.It is obvious that Mrs. St. Maugham still loves her daughter, even though she is disgusted that Olivia married her lover and is now pregnant. She does not want to hear anything about her new son-in-law. Laurel knew her mother was coming and has vanished. Miss Madrigal and Maitland scour the grounds looking for her but fail. Olivia warns her mother that she wants Laurel back and if necessary will resort to legal means. After she leaves, Miss Madrigal finds Laurel on the beach, standing next to a bonfire. Laurel breaks down and sobs.Unable to sleep one night, Miss Madrigal goes to the library for a book. There she finds Maitland, who tells her his story. He and his wife owned a small hotel and the St. Maughams used to stay there. Then he, his wife, and their child were in a car crash. They were killed and Maitland had a nervous breakdown. Mrs. St. Maugham stepped in and offered him the post as butler at her country estate. She is only there four months out of the year and the rest of the time he has the place to himself.While looking at framed pictures of Mrs. St. Maugham's admirers, Miss Maitland recognizes Judge McWhirrey. She is obviously upset but won't say why. Maitland reveals that the judge is an old friend of Mrs. St. Maugham's.On a trip into the village, Maitland buys a padlock for Miss Madrigal's bedroom door. While they are gone, Laurel snoops through Miss Madrigal's belongings. She finds nothing of interest but notices a briefcase on top of the wardrobe. It is locked. Just then she hears Maitland and Miss Madrigal returning. She takes the case with her and runs to an outbuilding, where she finds a tool to break the lock. Inside are paints and a palette. The inside of the lid is nearly covered with dabs of paint but part of a monogram shows. Laurel removes the paint with turpentine and sees the initials C.D.W. Obviously not Miss Madrigal's.Laurel leaves the dinner table early to return the case to Miss Madrigal's room but it is newly padlocked. Not to be deterred, she climbs out a window, crosses the roof, and enters the bedroom. She replaces the case but on her way back slips and falls into a tree. Her dress is caught on a branch and she has no choice but to call for help. Her grandmother believes her story about just wanting to climb a tree, but Miss Madrigal saws the branch off the next morning. She knows Laurel was in her room because the case was missing and the wardrobe door was ajar.Mrs. St. Maugham has a talk with Miss Madrigal while the latter is working in the garden. Miss Madrigal says that the soil is full of chalk, which is why nothing will grow. She recommends enriching the soil so the plants will survive. As to answering Mrs. St. Maugham's questions about her past, she gives deliberately vague answers.Concerned that Olivia might actually gain custody of Laurel, Mrs. St. Maugham invites Judge McWhirrey to lunch to discuss the situation. Laurel suddenly asks Miss Madrigal who C.D.W. is. Miss Madrigal says the initials belong to her married sister.When the Judge arrives for lunch, Miss Madrigal is distraught and spills her wine. Laurel, sensing that Miss Madrigal has a criminal past, deliberately asks questions about famous murder trials. The Judge tells about one a number of years earlier, where the defendant was hardly more than a child. She was accused of murdering her stepsister out of jealousy. Her name was Constance Doris Wakeland. Mrs. St. Maugham tries to stop the conversation after Miss Madrigal suddenly leaves the table. Laurel realizes she has gone too far. She goes after Miss Madrigal but is stopped by Maitland. He asks if she is satisfied now that she has unmasked Miss Madrigal's secret. Laurel is very remorseful and promises not to tell anyone.Maitland tries to comfort Miss Madrigal but her concern is for Laurel. She can easily see Laurel becoming like herself if she goes on lying and acting out. Miss Madrigal is ready to leave Mrs. St. Maugham's employment but Maitland persuades her to stay. She is a different person now.Before the Judge leaves, Miss Madrigal speaks to him privately. He recognized her at lunch but could not recall where they had met. Miss Madrigal reveals that he once sentenced her to death but it was commuted due to her youth.Miss Madrigal decides to tell Mrs. St. Maugham the truth, that she came to her directly from prison. Mrs. St. Maugham is horrified that Laurel has been under the care of a felon. Miss Madrigal doesn't mince words when she says that Laurel must go to her mother. It is a good thing that Olivia still wants her. Mrs. St. Maugham says that since Olivia is expecting another child there is no room for Laurel. They do not realize that Laurel is outside the door and has heard everything. When Olivia arrives, Laurel is packed and waiting on the front steps. She tells Miss Madrigal that it is she who made her change her mind and want to go with her mother. Olivia thanks Miss Madrigal for her help. She and Laurel drive away. Mrs. St. Maugham asks Miss Madrigal to stay on, to which she replies that she will stay as long as she is wanted. Together they will work on the garden and make it beautiful. Then Mrs. St. Maugham asks if Miss Madrigal was actually guilty of murdering her stepsister. Miss Madrigal replies that if she did not tell the many learned men at the top of their profession who questioned her all those years ago, she certainly will not tell Mrs. St. Maugham."

At her first board meeting, one of her fellow trustees rises with what he says is important news and after inhaling a pinch of snuff, falls over dead. The snuff seems to have been laced with strychnine and it's a clear cut case of murder. He had recently visited the ship and Miss Marple assumes he discovered something amiss. She decides to visit the ship to see what he may have learned that would cause someone to kill him. She finds a somewhat cold welcome and soon, two of the ships officers are found dead. Clearly Miss Marple's visit has stirred someone's desire to keep secret their activities.—garykmcd Miss Jane Marple (Dame Margaret Rutherford) is summoned to join a meeting of trustees of a fund of rehabilitation of criminals. One of the trustees has just visited the training ship H.M.S. Battledore and wants to report his findings. However, when he inhales snuff, he has a heart attack and dies. Miss Marple notes that the snuff box is empty, but she collects a spilled sample and after a chemical analysis, she finds that the trustee was poisoned. Miss Marple goes to the Battledore to investigate and has a cold reception of Captain Sydney De Courcy Rhumstone (Lionel Jeffries). Soon she discovers that there are many thieves on board and a great embezzlement of the rehabilitation fund, in the middle of a series of murders.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The opening scene is of Miss Marple entering a clothing shop to purchase a naval dress uniform for herself.Next she walks to a meeting of the ""Cape of Good Hope Youth Reclamation Centre"" for a Board of Trustees meeting, where she is the new member, replacing her uncle Rear Admiral Sir Hubert Marple. This Centre attempts to turn around juvenile delinquents by having them spend time on a Napoleonic era sailing ship, the Battledore. One of the members, Cecil Ffolly-Hardwicke is extremely anxious to bring up a matter about something he found out on his recent inspection of the Battledore. Miss Marple accidentally places her hand in his container of snuff. When he is finally allowed to speak, he takes a sniff of snuff and drops dead immediately. The police suspect a heart attack but Miss Marple knows otherwise because while everyone's attention was turned to Ffolly-Hardwicke, his snuff box was emptied by someone coming in from the window. Miss Marple notes that FFolly-Hardwicke scribbled ""33"" over and over again on his meeting notes. She takes home some of the snuff that she had spilled earlier.At her cottage, with her friend Mr. Springer, she does some chemical tests and determines that Hardwicke's snuff was contaminated with strychnine.Miss Marple arranges a visit to the Battledore where, as a trustee, she is treated with great deference. On the ship we meet the Captain Sydney Rhumstone (Lionel Jeffries) who is unhappy about her visit but exults that her stay will be only for the day. He soon learns to his dismay that she plans to stay several days. The crew, besides the captain and the youths, consists of Commander Breeze-Connington, Lieutenant Commander Dimchurch, Lieutenant Compton, Sub Lieutenant Humbert, Matron 1st Class Fanbraid, and Assistant Matron Shirley Boston.It becomes clear that the captain and the matron are having an affair as are Sub Lieutenant Humbert and Assistant Matron Boston. Both of these are against naval regulations and must be kept secret. We also see that Humbert and Compton detest each other because Compton keeps flirting with Boston. Lieutenant Commander Compton acts very suspiciously through every scene.In the mean time, Mr. Stringer has checked into a hotel that gives him a view of the harbored ship.This first night when Mr. Stringer and Miss Marple are supposed to communicate in Morse code, she intercepts a shore message. ""Job must be done tonight, Dusty"". We see that the message was meant for Lieutenant Compton. Later he reports to the captain that shore leave has returned minus one Dusty. Dusty Miller is apparently the worst of the delinquents. This was a ruse to get the captain to send out another group to do whatever the job was.Mr. Stringer receives a message from Miss Marple ""Shore Patrol on way, follow"". He does so and discovers they are burglars. He borrows their boat to row out to the Battledore and report this to Miss Marple. This is all overheard by Compton who takes a belaying pin with the intention of killing Miss Marple. However, he is killed by someone we can't see by being run through with a sword.The next morning Miss Marple and the captain discover Compton's body hung from a yard arm.Chief Inspector Craddock and Sergeant Bacon come on board to conduct an investigation. Unfortunately for him he discovers that all officers on board own a sword. The captain is not happy to learn that he was the last person to see Compton alive at 11PM the previous night. Craddock receives word that the shore patrol is all at the police station reporting the theft of their boat which prevented them from returning to the ship.Craddock is now dismayed to discover Miss Marple on board. She, in the mean time, is searching Compton's room. Some one enters the room so she hides in a closet. When the person leaves, she discovers a bureau drawer left slightly open and in it is a very large envelope addressed to the trustees and with the number ""33"" scribbled on it. Craddock goes ashore to find the dinghy as he believes whoever stole it is also the murderer of Compton. Miss Marple hurries to Mr. Stringer's hotel to warn him to lay low but then changes her mind and sends him to Milchester to find out what kind of information would be contained in the envelope she pulled from the bureau. Craddock has received a tip on the whereabouts of the person who stole the dinghy but when he rushes to the hotel room he finds only Miss Marple. He places her in a jail cell where he takes a statement from her and then releases her at the orders of the Chief Constable. He informs her that he thinks he knows who was Compton's accomplice. Six robberies have taken place in recent weeks and in each case a party had been held and Sub Lieutenant Humbert and his girlfriend Matron Boston had attended the party. Miss Marple tells him he is wrong in his thinking.That night we see Assistant Matron Boston leave her room and go down into the ship's hold where she reaches into a cannon, a snap is heard, and she pulls out her hand bleeding, she then collapses, dead. Meanwhile, Miss Marple is creeping around and sees Lieutenant Commander Dimchurch sneaking into the ship's medical stores. A scream is heard and Miss Maple finds the body of the assistant matron.The next morning Craddock and Bacon are again on board and tell the captain that he must cancel the night's Trafalgar Day Celebration which exasperates the captain. The doctor who investigates Boston's body announces she was killed with a rare poison. The captain wants Miss Marple off the ship. Craddock confers with Miss Marple; he has now transferred his suspicion from Humbert to the assistant matron. Miss Marple suggests that the assistant matron was pretending to love Humbert so she could be invited to the parties (Humbert was a member of a society family) and that she really was in love with her partner Compton. She also speculates that a mousetrap loaded with poison had been hidden in the cannon and that she had decided to hide her share of the loot in the same place that someone else had chosen to hide something also. During this conversation in the captain's cabin, CI Craddock is knocked out by a rock thrown through the window of the ship. On the rock was a note to Miss Marple from Mr. Stringer. The note said that the envelope he had been investigating was used to send quarterly reports of the ship accounts and that the report showed the ship's compliment at 45 when in reality it was only 33. She talks Craddock into allowing the captain to take the crew onshore that night for the Trafalgar Day celebration so that a trap can be set for the murderer. She thinks Compton had stumbled on the swindle and was blackmailing whoever was responsible for the false reports and that whoever that was had killed Ffolly-Hardwicke and Compton (and incidentally Assistant Matron Boston).That evening, every one of the crew go onshore, but Miss Marple stays claiming she wants to cherish her last night on-board ship. She also suggests to all the officers that she is aware of the swindling plot. She hatches a scheme to use herself as bait and have Craddock and Bacon hiding on board. Later, a ship's boat pushes off toward the ship with one person on board. Craddock and Bacon are hiding under a hatch that is propped open with a belaying pin. We hear footsteps and see one of the male officers walking the deck. He accidentally bumps the belaying pin and Craddock and Bacon are locked in.Miss Marple hears footsteps approaching her cabin and it is Lieutenant Commander Dimchurch, who stayed on-board. He seems to be threatening her but then confesses that he wanted to tell her he was resigning because he has incurable seasickness. She says that he needn't resign. He then leaves and is struck unconscious by someone on deck.Miss Marple investigates the hold and finds the booby-trapped cannon. She is carrying a sword to poke around. Just as she finds the hiding place, she is interrupted by Commander Breeze-Connington. He reveals himself to be somewhat insane and thinks he is rightfully an admiral. He has been embezzling to make up the pay difference. She calls for help from Craddock who doesn't appear so she and the commander duel with swords. Although she reveals she was ladies national fencing champion in 1931, she is over-matched by the commander who announces he was fencing champion of the Yangtze Fleet that same year. They fight and he disarms her. Just as he is about to run her through, Mr. Stringer appears from behind and conks the commander on the head.Craddock and Bacon are released from where they have been trapped.The next morning, the captain is found innocent of malfeasance by the board of trustees which has assembled on-board. He confesses his love for the matron and their desire to get married. The trustee allows him to marry and remain as captain.The final scene is the captain and matron saying goodbye to Miss Marple as she is rowed to shore. The captain jokes that he thought all along she was ""an old darling"". They laugh."
Fate Is the Hunter,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058091/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An airline executive refuses to believe that pilot error, by his friend, caused a fatal crash and persists in looking for another reason. An airliner crashes near Los Angeles due to an unusual string of coincidences. A stewardess, who is the sole survivor, joins airline executives in discovering the causes of the crash.—Arthur H. Olsen <102526.2017@compuserve.com> After a Consolidated Airlines flight crashes resulting in the deaths of 57 passengers and crew, those on the ground try to piece it all together. What is known is that the pilot, Jack Savage, reported a fire in their right engine and then the flight loses communications with the airport. One survivor, flight attendant Martha Webster, tells them that the left engine fire alarm also went off after the communications break but a test of the wreckage shows that the engine was in perfect working order. The investigation is looking at attributing the crash to pilot error. Savage had something of a playboy reputation and was reportedly seen out in a couple of bars with a friend just a few hours before flight time. The airline's director of operations, Sam McBane, knew Savage well as they flew together in World War II and refuses to accept the verdict. He decides to do his own research and he sees a completely different side of Savage that dispels the myths around the man. He convinces the airline to allow him to recreate the flight which delivers the solution to the mystery.—garykmcd Sam McBane is an executive at Consolidated Airlines. One of Consolidated's passenger planes crashes shortly after takeoff, killing 53 people on board. There is only one survivor, a flight attendant. The pilot of the plane was Captain Jack Savage, a long-time friend of Sam's. Sam and Jack flew transport planes together in WW2. Jack was a playboy, and the press are painting him as as irresponsible and undisciplined...and the likely cause of the crash. Consolidated's CEO and other executives are quite happy to go along with this view, as it makes Jack Savage the scapegoat for the crash and absolves the airline from blame. However, Sam thinks else-wise and sets out to find the truth, and hopefully clear his friend.—grantss Airline executive Sam McBane goes out on a limb to try and prove that a major crash wasn't the fault of his pilot friend, even though it may jeopodise his chances of promotion to Vice President.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Pilot Jack Savage (Rod Taylor) is suspected of drinking the night before a flight and causing an airliner crash that leaves only a single survivor, one of the flight attendants. Savage is suspected of being the cause because the investigation rules out sabotage and mechanical failure of the second engine.His wartime buddy, airline executive Sam C. McBane (Glenn Ford) is convinced of his friend's innocence and investigates doggedly. His investigation, and his relentless defense of Savage, imperils a possible promotion with the airline. The other airline executive being considered for the promotion is an engineer and is happy to discover the second engine did not fail and that the crash may be a pilot error, the pilot being an old friend of McBane's and working in McBane's area of the airline. The airline executives would like to have the pilot blamed to reduce the airline's liability to the victims' families.Much of the movie is spent recreating McBane's war relationship with Savage and following up on his recent activities to justify his defense of the dead pilot. Pushing his credibility with the airline to the limit, he convinces them to recreate the accident flight in order to prove up his theory that the crash was the result of a combination of unusual events. McBane tracks down Savage's drinking companion, Mickey, and discovers that Savage was a member of AA and was not drinking alcohol while out with his friend.During the flight, the flight attendant brings up a cup of coffee to the flight deck, which she remembers the pilot sitting it on the instrument console. Recreating this, they experience the same radio communications failure and see the second engine failure light caused by an instrument panel shortage from the spilled coffee, thus proving the premise of the accident not being pilot error."

Taggart has not told anyone his story of survival, the mystery deepens when they find the building locked in chains and he picks the locks with ease. Searching the building reveals little other than a small cache of handguns and ammunition.
That night back at the hotel Nolan finds Otis drunk instead of getting ready to stand guard. Since the death of his wife Otis has become increasingly despondent. Nolan explains that since the attack, Otis has become more valuable than he realizes. This seems to improve Otis spirits and he agrees to go out and take his turn standing guard.
Having been relieved by Otis, Mel comes in carrying a box of bank notes he took from the local bank. He talks of the futility of money and how hes changed. Three days ago he would have killed for the amount of money in the box, now it simply doesnt matter. Lorna seems put out and a little frightened by Mels outburst.
With everyone asleep, Lorna becomes restless and goes to the kitchen for a glass of milk. Nolan patrolling outside sees one of the aliens approach the kitchen and observe Lorna. It seems to have no interest in the girl other than to observe and moves away ignoring the rest and Nolan.After the incident, Taggart wakes and begins gathering his clothes and food as though preparing to leave. Unknown to everyone Violet has come alive again in one of the upstairs bedroom and begins moving through the house. Taggart sees her and shoots twice, seeming to kill her. Everyone is puzzled by the event, Violet seemed completely normal except for her eyes which have been replaced two grey protruding blobs.Nolan decides to relocate everyone to the army store, wait till dawn, and then the group will head south and away from the village. Taggart is not happy with the plan and pistol whips Nolan when they are alone. He then finds Peggy and tells her the others are going south, but they will be going north. He forces Peggy at gunpoint to his car and they leave.Mel comes out to take his turn as guard and finds Nolan hurt and gets him back inside.Peggy complains about being cold and Taggart agrees to stop at the hotel to get her some warmer clothes. While he is inside she take the opportunity to escape. Taggart reemerges and sees Peggy gone. He also sees two aliens approaching his car. Taggart makes a snap decision to drive north out of the village leaving Peggy to fend for herself.Back at the army hall, Nolan thinks Taggart has probably gone back to the hotel with Peggy before leaving town. If he is not back in 30 minutes, the remaining members of the group are to leave without himAt the Hotel, Peggy sees one of the aliens enter, she retreats upstairs and becomes horrified to see a number of villages reanimated and searching for her.

Peggy sees an opportunity to escape, however as she leaves the hotel she is cornered by an alien and a number of villages.

He instructs Otis and Mel to go back into town to collect anything that Lorna might need to care for the baby. Eventually Lorna gives birth to a daughter and both appear healthy.Nolan begins organizing to get out of the village. Peggy warns him that Lorna may need some extra recovery time, adding to Nolans problems he finds Otis too drunk to stand up.Running out of options he asks Mel to listen to the radio static and then explains he thinks it is some form of homing beacon used to direct the robots. Mel understands if the transmitter can be destroyed they can disable the robots. Nolan puts together a rudimentary direction finder and heads out to find the transmitter. Nolan takes a series of readings and discovers the robots using an old military repeater station.Back at the army shed, Taggart, now controlled by the robots, arrives and leads the robots inside. Peggy calls Nolan on the radio and tells him whats happening. With a greater sense of urgency Nolan rigs the explosives and blows the transmitter stopping the robots in their tracks.Otis recovers from his drunken stupor long enough to see Taggart is still moving and shoots him
Nolan and Mel arrive back at the shed.They have a new evacuation plan. Nolan will take a plane from the local airport and fly south. Hopefully if there are any other survivors they will see the plane and begin moving to the south of the country.Chapman_glen@yahoo.com"

Unemployed Czech-speaking writer Nicholas Whistler (Dirk Bogarde) thinks he has a job visiting Prague for a bit of industrial espionage. In fact, he is now in the employ of British Intelligence. His pretty driver on arrival behind the Iron Curtain, Comrade Vlasta Simoneva (Sylva Koscina), is a Czech agent. Just as well, she's immediately attracted to 007's unwitting replacement.—Jeremy Perkins {J-26} Officials in some Government department are cataloguing someone's possessions. This leaves a position vacant.Nicholas Whistler is signing on at the unemployment office, and to his dismay, he is given a referral for a job interview. It can't be me, says he, I'm a writer. But he has to go to the interview otherwise he will lose his unemployment benefit. His friends commiserateHe goes for the interview, and it emerges that he speaks the Czech language, having been born in Czechoslovakia, but he is a British citizen. It is employed that the company is a glass manufacturer. The salary is remarkably generous, to his surprise, and he agrees to come back on Monday.A call comes in from the Russian embassy; a British agent has been neutralised in Romania. The man was Carruthers, and he was exposed by his interest in a woman.Whistler returns on Monday and Colonel Cunliffe, who interviewed him last week, and his assistant Allsop, discuss an urgent trip to Prague. He will accompany a company man called Jones, a Sales Manager, although after Whistler has gone the men mention that Jones doesn't exist.
Whistler returns after lunch and is told that Jones is ill. Cunliffe explains that Whistler will be meeting a Mr Galushka, and he will hand over a document that he will insert into a book that Whistler has to carry. There is a password, ""Hot enough for June"". And Whistler wants to know the reply, which is ""And you should have been here last September"". Whistler is hurried out of the building and is in a plane on his way to Prague.On the plane he is sitting next to a man with a newspaper; the front page article is that a businessman got 25 years in jail for spying.
He checks in at the Prague hotel, and evidently has a spacious room. A man called Josef, his floor waiter, comes to the room with a letter; when he opens it it informs him that a driver will come for him at the hotel at 3:30 tomorrow.Tomorrow his car is waiting, and his driver is a beautiful, but rather forbidding woman, Vlasta Simoneva. They arrive at the offices of the glassworks, and Mr Galushka receives him, and asks him what he wishes to see. The interview is awkward, and Whistler tries out the password, without success. In the canteen he finds his inability to discuss the technicalities of glassmaking awkward, and armed guards are on patrol. Again he tries the password on another official, without success.There is a demonstration of unbreakable glass, at which Whistler is invited to throw a missile to break it. Naturally the glass doesn't break, until Whistler and his host turns away, when the glass spontaneously shatters.At the end of the visit, Whistler goes to the washroom, and an attendant engages him in conversation, and seems to be just on the point of mentioning the password, when Galushka bursts in and hustles him out.On the car ride back to his hotel, Whistler asks the female driver Vlasta to have a drink with him. They are in a bar and there is some unlikely conversation with stereotypes of the communist and capitalist systems. They agree to have dinner out that evening.She leaves and makes a phone call, and reports that she will be having dinner with Whistler. She shows some independence which does not go down well with her boss. Meanwhile Whistler phones Cunliffe; he wasn't supposed to know the number; but he asks when Jones will be arriving, but Cunliffe tells him that Jones has died.That evening at the restaurant, Whistler and Vlasta have arrived; she has changed and is wearing an elegant dress. We see that her bosses are observing. In conversation, she is guarded about her Father, knowing that she is being overheard by a badly hidden microphone. Suddenly she says she must go home.The next day she and Whistler are at a lido enjoying themselves; her immediate boss disapproves but his boss is evidently prepared to let matters continue. Whistler and Vlasta arrive at her father's house by bus in a rainstorm; he isn't there but she has to change her wet clothes. She tells Whistler that her Father is away and won't be home that night.The phone rings and Vlasta picks up the receiver, but then replaces it without speaking. They get amorous and we assume intimacy has taken place. Afterwards, she is in a solemn mood; she asks him whether he would tell her if he was doing something bad in Prague. He tells her simply that he will be visiting the factory once more tomorrow, and she says unconvincingly that that is what she will believe.The next day Whistler gets a taxi to his hotel, and Vlasta gets reprimanded for her frivolous attitude to her work. As Whistler goes to the car to take him to the factory, a different female driver is taking him. When they get to the factory, the substitute driver, who had seemed unsympathetic, gives him a note from Vlasta with a smile.In the factory he goes to the lavatory and meets the contact, who is obviously a British agent. He is contemptuous of Whistler's naivety, and puts a document in Whistler's book. Back at his hotel, Whistler dismembers the book and finds a folded paper, which he removes and puts in his pocket.There is a fairground in town, and at a shooting gallery he encounters Vlasta, who tells him to take a rifle as they mustn't be seen talking together. Don't wait for the plane tomorrow, she says: you must leave today; and ""If I don't see you again, please remember, I didn't want this to happen.""Back at the hotel he tells the floor manager to have his bill made up and brought to him; but when he returns Mr Simoneva, Vlasta's father bursts in and wants to question him.In fact he wants him to sign a confession, and threatens him with a fatal ""accident"". In fact for the first time Whistler shows some initiative and manages to escape from Simoneva and his sidekick, and he evades them, and gets into another room in the hotel. He rings room service from there and orders a drink from room service. When the waiter comes, he knocks him out and changes clothes with him. He talks his way out of the hotel.He manages to get to the vicinity of the British Embassy, but just as he is going to go in, a police car arrives and distributes photographs of him to policemen in the vicinity. He steals a bicycle and having hidden somewhere overnight, he goes to Simoneva's house the next morning. Simoneva is just leaving and Whistler goes in and confronts Vlasta about her father being a secret policeman. She tells him that she too is in the secret police.She asks him if he really posted the document; he says that he didn't, and she turns angry because she realises that all he wants is for her to help him get to the British Embassy; but she agrees to try and he burns the document.
Simoneva goes to the British Embassy, because the ambassador has complained about the secret police who are loitering at the entrance to the embassy.Now we see Vlasta and Whistler together in a street café; she tells him to go to the embassy now; she has contrived a change of clothes for him; he is dressed as a plumber. As he approaches the embassy, a dozen or so men dressed as waiters-the clothing presumed to be being worn by Whistler-approach as well, and the police concentrate on them. Whistler manages to sneak in. However as he does so, Simoneva is leaving and recognises him. Whistler manages to run off.There is an agricultural procession taking place, and Whistler manages to escape by riding on a trailer, among the others. He goes to a lido where he gets a token for his clothes; he manages to exchange the token with another man and claims his clothes, which prove to be a conspicuous national costume.Much later he makes his way back to the cafe where he had left Vlasta, as she had said there is a loft where he could hide. She is still there and they embrace. He is going to stay there overnight. The next morning he is near the embassy, and when the milkman approaches with his horse and cart, Whistler overpowers him and puts his clothes on, and goes to the embassy yard. But the gates are locked, and no-one comes when he rings the bell.However eventually he manages to get in, just in the nick of time. He is given a change of clothes, and Cunliffe appears. Whistler is angry with Cunliffe for having deceived him about the espionage. He takes him to the airport, and Simoneva turns up with his daughter; she is going to England on a trade mission. Whistler and Vlasta sit together on the plane, and Cunliffe and Simoneva walk away from the place, arm in arm."

A Yemenite Jewish family that was flown to Israel during ""Operation Magic Carpet"" - a clandestine operation that flew 49,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel the year after the state was formed - is forced to move to a government settlement camp. The patriarch of the family, portrayed by Chaim Topol, tries to make money and get better housing, in a country that can barely provide for its own and is in the midst absorbing hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.—Fiona Kelleghan Peasant Sallah Shabati is a Sephardic Jew from Egpyt. He is more a schemer than a worker, using the former rather than the latter to get what he wants. He would however rather spend his days playing backgammon. For a better life, he and his family - his pregnant wife, their seven children, and his mother - decide to move to Israel into a new housing complex. Upon their arrival in Israel, they find that before they move into their house, they will be temporarily housed in a run down transit camp, that camp which has dirt roads and small huts. They soon learn that the temporary nature of their stay at the camp is less temporary than they had envisioned, as one of their fellow camp members, Mr. Goldstein, has been there for six years. He finds that wherever he goes, Sallah runs into one bureaucratic red tape process after another in his end goal of moving into a nice new house. He eventually learns that he can expedite his move into one of those houses for 1,000 lira, which he does not have and would be difficult to earn as he has no trade, and the government will only issue work they want done. He also tries to deal with those at the neighboring kibbutz, they who have volunteered to orient new immigrants at the camp to Israeli life. Sallah's mentality is contrary to that of the those at the kibbutz, not only the concept of communal ownership of everything and the good of the group as opposed to the individual, but also his traditional Sephardic ways against the kibbutz's modern Israeli ways.—Huggo A Yemenite Jewish family that was flown to Israel during ""Operation Magic Carpet"" - a clandestine operation that flew 49,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel the year after the state was formed - is forced to move to a government settlement camp. The patriarch of the family tries to make money and get better housing, in a country that can barely provide for its own and is in the midst absorbing hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Humor, sensitivity, politics and music highlight this capsule of history.—Danny Yarhi <dyarhi7@aol.com> Sallah Shabati (Hebrew: ) is a 1964 Israeli comedy film about the chaos of Israeli immigration and resettlement. This social satire placed the director Ephraim Kishon and producer Menahem Golan among the first Israeli filmmakers to achieve international success. It also introduced actor Chaim Topol (Fiddler on the Roof) to audiences worldwide.
The film's name, Sallah Shabati is a play on words; ostensibly a Yemenite Jewish name, it is also intended to evoke the phrase , (lit. ""Sorry I came""), equivalent to ""excuse me for living"" in English. In earlier print versions of Kishon's short stories which were revised for the film, the character was known as Saadia Shabtai.
The film begins with Sallah Shabati, a Mizrahi Jewish immigrant, arriving with his family in Israel. Upon arrival he is brought to live in a ma'abara, or transit camp. He is given a broken down, one room shack in which to live in with his family and spends the rest of the movie attempting to make enough money to purchase adequate housing. His money-making schemes are often comical and frequently satirizes the political and social stereotypes in Israel of the time."

Upon arrival, he finds that his Estate Manager Bholaram has made a hotel out of their bungalow and has even rented out some rooms for the season. He confronts the Manager, and both compromise. He meets Champa, who sells flowers for a living, and both in love. They plan to marry, but surprisingly, Champa's dad, Dinu, is opposed to this marriage. To complicate matters even more, Rajivlal finds out that he is not the son of Rani Maa, and he goes about to find his real identity. It is now up to Rani Maa to find out why Dinu is refusing to permit Champa to marry Rajivlal, and who his real parents are.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Wealthy and pampered Rajiv Lal (Shammi Kapoor) is the only son of widowed Rani Maa. At the silver jubilee anniversary of the mill that his father, the late Sanjiv Lal opened, he announces a bonus of 5 lakh rupees to be distributed amongst the workers, annoying his mother. A servant at the house, Karuna (Mridula Rani), suggests marrying him off to stop his immature antics, to which Rani Maa agrees (Although Karuna supports Rajiv saying that his generous heart is a sign of his future stature). Rani Maa's manager, Shyamlal, arranges for her to meet some girls, as she insists that Rajiv will marry a girl of her choice. Rajiv returns home and sees all the girls - he correctly surmises that his mother wants him to marry, and he pretends to be a mute who walks with a limp in order to chase all the prospective suitors off. His plan succeeds, although he is in a dilemma as his mother is furious at him. One of his friends Chander (Anup Kumar) suggests that he should go away to their bungalow in Kashmir - after all, Rani Maa never goes there.Upon arrival in Kashmir, he finds that his estate manager, Bholaram (Dhumal), has made a hotel out of their bungalow and has rented out some rooms for the season. Rajiv tells the tenants that he is Seth Rajiv Lal the owner of the bungalow, although when he meets Bholaram, the latter informs him that Rani Maa had called him, and told him not to let Rajiv stay at the bungalow, should he come. Rajiv manages to convince Bholaram to tell Rani Maa that he is not there. Bholaram tells the tenants in the house that Rajiv is mad, and in his madness, thinks that he is the real owner of the estate. Meanwhile a group of girls have rented rooms via Bholaram and their caretaker is Rama (Tun Tun). when Chander arrives, he tells everyone that Chander is the Rajiv Lal, the real owner of the estate.The next day, Rajiv meets Champa (Sharmila Tagore), a girl who sells flowers for a living. He buys her flowers for 20 rupees when they are priced at 5, and tells her that he is not the owner, but the driver. Soon enough, after a few misadventures (her dad explains to Champa a man paying Rs 20 for rs 5 flowers must have an ulterior motive and orders her to return the money. But Rajiv explains that he truly loves her and she believes him), they fall in love and decide to marry, but there are a few obstacles. First of all, Mohan (Pran), the forest manager, has loaned out some money (Rs 800) to Champa's father, Dinu (Nazir Hussain), and he insists on marrying Champa if Dinu cannot repay the debt. Mohan had seen Champa roaming around with Rajiv and got pissed when she ignored her.
Things become complicated when Mohan tells Dinu that he knows that Dinu is not Champa's real father, and he blackmails Dinu into getting Champa married to him, or else he will let out the secret to Champa, which Dinu is really afraid of. Dinu confides in his friend that Champa is a daughter of a rich household & gives the address of the house from where he abducted Champa as a child (where his sister works) (Dinu is blind and doesn't know that Mohan is overhearing the conversation). Mohan travels to Delhi and meets Karuna and mentions that the girl abducted by Dinu (her brother) may still be alive. He injures Karuna while running away.
Mohan returns to Kashmir to pressure Dinu to marry Champa to her, telling him that now he knows the full truth of the matter.
Champa still continues to meet Rajiv on the sly, but all of that comes to an end when three girls, who are tenants in his house, reveal in her presence that he is not the driver, but the owner of the estate. Feeling betrayed, Champa runs off. Before Rajiv can go after her, he receives a trunk call from his mother, and he is informed that Karuna is seriously ill.After telling Bholaram to explain everything to Champa, he leaves for Bombay, and finds Karuna on her deathbed, with Rani Maa at her side. Karuna tells Rajiv that he is not the real son of Rani Maa and that his biological father is none other than her brother, Dinu. Many years ago, Dinu had sold him off to Karuna for alcohol, and Rani Maa had taken him in. But Dinu ran out of money as he spent everything on booze. Soon after, Rani Maa gave birth to a baby girl and Karuna offered to return Rajiv back to Dinu, but Dinu (who wanted Rajiv to inherit the vast wealth of the house) abducted her, intending to kill her so that Rajiv will be the sole heir to Rani Maa's wealth.
However, on the way, Dinu tripped and fell, and loses his eyesight, so he does not kill the girl. Rajiv is shocked at the revelation, but more so is Rani Maa, who had assumed that her baby girl was still-born. Before Karuna can say who the girl is, she dies. Shyamlal informs the two that the day Karuna fell ill, a man from Kashmir (Mohan) had come to see her and asked about Rani Maa's girl, but Karuna hadn't told him anything. Rajiv and Rani Maa head back to Kashmir to find out who the girl is, and Rajiv, acting on a tip from Bholaram (Mohan had bragged to Bholaram while being drunk, that he knows who the daughter of Rani Ma is), goes to confront Mohan.He beats Mohan unconscious, and Mohan's friend tells Rajiv who the girl is - Champa. He goes to find her and finds out that she will marry Mohan in a few days. Dinu returns home and Champa questions him. He lies to her at first, but when Rajiv drops a hint that he is the son that Dinu had sold all those years ago, the latter hugs him and admits that Champa is not his daughter. Rani Maa comes in and finds Champa, and the two embrace. Mohan arrives with his goons and decides to forcibly marry Champa.
Dinu tries to stop him, but Mohan beats him badly. The goons tie Rajiv up and then take Rani Maa and Champa to the wedding venue forcibly. Back at Rajiv's bungalow, Chander (Anoop Kumar), Rajiv's friend, and Shyamlal decide to go after them and see why they are taking so long. Rajiv manages to escape from his captors, but Dinu is still unconscious. He meets with Chander and Shyamlal on the way and tells them to get the police while he goes after Mohan.
He breaks into Mohan's hideout and stops the wedding ceremony. A fight ensues, and Mohan runs off, Rajiv hot on his tail. The police arrive soon after and arrests all of Mohan's goons. Meanwhile, Rajiv and Mohan get into a fight, and the police come to take the latter away. The film ends with a shot of Rajiv and Champa, happily married, driving away in his car."

The owner of the warehouse has great damage, because he sells wire and does not receive, a situation aggravated by government default that does not pay the bonus he owes. Mario, one of the soldiers, meets Luiza, who lives in the city. In the warehouse, another police officer uses his authority to explain the operation of a weapon. Gaucho, a truck driver, manages to overcome him in the preparation of the weapon. The policeman feels demoralized in front of everyone. Mario says that Gaucho is the friend who saved him during a sad operation to expel squatters while still a soldier. They talk. Gaucho questions the local situation and says he does not understand the government, that instead of sending food, when the population is starving, sends soldiers. While they are waiting for the truck that will carry food, the policemen, stranded, bet to see if they hit a kid who ran away. When firing, the policeman hits a man, the owner of the kid. In order not to create malaise in the population, they say the man was found dead and who killed him was an outsider. Gaucho insinuated to Mario and Ze that they, along with other police officers, had killed the man. Mario goes to the man's wake, because Luiza is there. Sad, she insults him, saying distrust of them, but then kisses him. The truck arrives to take the food from the warehouse. The policemen, scared, watch everything under starving eyes of the population, who watch the food go away. A man arrives at the bar asking for a box to bury his son, who died of hunger. The Gaucho revolts with the passivity and cowardice of the population. Steal the gun from cop Zé and shoot the truck. In the exchange of shots, Gaucho dies. Mario is desolate. He says goodbye to Luiza and leaves with the other policemen. The ox, which until then was holy to the faithful, is slain and the whole population moves forward to take a piece of meat."

Born with an Armour and ear-rings, and bequeathed as a gift from Surya to an unwed Kunthi (M.V. Rajamma), Karna (Shivaji Ganesan) is abandoned so as to prevent embarrassment for her. He is set afloat in the Ganga, rescued and adopted by a horse-carriage driver, who is employed with Raja Dhritarashtra. Instead of adapting to his foster father's profession, he was more interested in obtaining training as a warrior. Upon being refused, he turned to Suryadev, and learned all aspects of warfare - little knowing that soon he will be befriended by Rajkumar Dhuryodhan (S.A. Ashokan), and be compelled to take up arms against the Pandavas - the sons of none other than Kunthi herself.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Embarrassed by the birth of a son, an unwed Kunthi (M.V. Rajamma) instructs her maid to abandon him in the river Ganga. The child is set afloat and is rescued, adopted, and named Karna (Shivaji Ganesan) by Charioteer Adhiratha and his wife, Radha. After maturing he does not want to follow in his foster father's footsteps and wants to be a warrior. Unable to secure the patronage of any Guru due to his parentage, he is assisted by Suryadev and then by Sage Parshuram, and excels in all forms of warfare especially archery. He then befriends Rajkumar Dhuryodhana (Ashokan), will participate in the humiliation of Draupadi - setting the initial grounds of the battle of Kurukshetra - where he will join Dhuryodhana to battle the Pandavas - none other than Kunthi's sons.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Unmarried princess Kunti is blessed by the Sun god with a baby boy, which she abandons in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan, who names him Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken. He does not want to become a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.One day, Indra, the king of Devas (celestial deities), disguised as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshattriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.Karnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot, and they fall in love. Subhangi's parents initially disapprove of their romance, but eventually they accept, and the couple get married. A few years later, Krishna, a supporter of the Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first son whom she abandoned. Karnan gets to know about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjuna during the impending Kurukshetra War, and that he will attack Arjuna with the Nagastra weapon only once. Karnan refuses to join his brothers, the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhana.Before the start of the Kurukshetra war, Duryodhanas ministry assembles to appoint the generals of the army. Bheeshma is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bheeshma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son Vrishasena who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjuna afterwards.The next day, the vengeful Karnan uses the Nagastra to try killing Arjuna, but Krishna saves Arjuna by preventing the arrow from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the Nagastra more than once, he is unable to kill Arjuna. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a big hole, and he steps down to relieve it. At that time, Arjuna, under the direction of Krishna, shoots many arrows at Karnan that severely wound him. Krishna tells Arjuna that the Dharma (noble charity) that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishna disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Out of generosity, Karnan donates all his virtues to the ""Brahmin"". At this juncture, Arjuna shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him. The Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother mourn his death. His mother Kunti also mourns his death, while Subhangi dies due to the shock of her husband's death in the war. Arjuna remorses killing Karnan, until Krishna reveals that the curses by Indra and Parasurama were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father the Sun in the other world."
Sangam,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058547/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Returning home from war after being assumed dead, a pilot weds the woman he has long loved, unaware that she had been planning to marry his best friend. Sunder Khanna is an orphan and lives a poor lifestyle in India. He is friendly with wealthy Gopal Verma, the only child of Judge Verma; and a wealthy girl named Radha, who is the daughter of an army Captain. The trio grow up, and Sunder falls head-over-heels in love with Radha, but she as well as her parents reject him. Sunder decides to prove himself to be worthy of them and enrolls in the Indian Air Force, carries out a risky flight to help army soldiers, disappears, is believed to be dead, but re-surfaces virtually unscathed, and returns to get married to Radha. After the marriage the couple go for a honeymoon in Rome, Paris, London, and Switzerland. Sunder also invites Gopal, who is now a Magistrate. One day before going to attend a party, Sunder finds his life turned upside down when he comes a love letter written to Radha by an unknown male. Torn with suspicion and hatred he grabs his revolver and confronts Radha in order to find out the author of this letter and kill him. Watch what happens when Radha is confronted and the response she provides to Sunder.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) Sundar (Raj Kapoor), Gopal (Rajendra Kumar) and Radha (Vyjayantimala) have been friends since childhood. As they grow into adults, Sundar develops an obsessive romantic attraction to Radha; for him, she is the only woman in the world. Gopal was studying overseas and returns after completing his lawyer studies. Sundar is poor and Gopal is the rich guy, but Gopal is a devoted friend to Sundar (who is considered by everyone to be a loafer and vagabond). Radha prefers Gopal, who is also in love with her, and systematically resists Sundar's advances.
Matching Sundar's great love for Radha is his unswerving devotion to his friendship with Gopal. Sundar accidentally gets a letter that Radha had written for Gopal, but the letter is not addressed to anyone, and Sundar assumes its written to him. Sundar admits his feelings for Radha to Gopal and says that if Gopal had loves Radha he would have gladly sacrificed his love on the altar of friendship. Gopal is in a dilemma, but decides to step back and pay his debt of friendship to Sundar by letting him pursue Radha.Gopal is asked by Sundar to represent him in front of Radha's parents and ask for Radha's hand. Her parents refuse as Sundar has no income. They want to marry Radha to Gopal, but Gopal says he cant betray Sundar. Radha also rebuffs Sundar saying that he is frigging nobody and she can never love him. Sundar is hurt.Eventually, Sundar enlists in the Indian Air Force and is assigned a dangerous mission in Kashmir, delivering items to soldiers fighting there. Before leaving, he extracts a promise from Gopal, whom he trusts implicitly, never to let any man come between Radha and himself while he is away. Sundar subsequently completes his mission, but his aircraft is shot down and he is listed as killed in action and presumed dead. For his bravery, he is awarded the Param Vir Chakra. Till he is away, Gopal fulfills his promise, despite many advances from Radha. Radha refuses to answer Sundar's letters, so Gopal writes letters to Sundar making it look like they came from Radha.
The news saddens Radha and Gopal, but they are nonetheless now free to profess their love for one another. Among other expressions of love, Gopal writes her an unsigned love letter that touches her and which she hides away. Just when they begin taking steps to be married, Sundar returns, safe and sound. The self-effacing Gopal sacrifices himself once more (He tells Radha to keep quite about the letters he had written to Sundar on her behalf), stepping back into the shadows and watching as the reborn Sundar resumes his wooing of Radha. Before Sundar enlisted, Radha's parents did not like him, but after he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, they are happy to give her away in marriage to him (her dad is a retired army officer and hence has respect for servicemen).After the couple returns from an extended European honeymoon, Sundar is deliriously happy, as his life's dream has been realized. Radha is resolved to be faithful to her husband and to put Gopal out of her mind, privately asking him to stay away from her and Sundar because of the torture his presence causes her. Sundar's devotion to Gopal, however, is such that he constantly tries to draw him into their lives, much to Radha's chagrin. The perfection of their marital bliss is, however, shattered when Sundar accidentally discovers the unsigned love letter Gopal had written to Radha. An enraged Sundar pulls a pistol on his wife and demands she divulge the name of her supposed lover, threatening to kill the man, but she refuses.In the days that follow, Sundar becomes consumed with discovering the identity of the letter's author. Radha's life becomes miserable, lived out against the incessant drama of Sundar's jealousy, threats, anger, and fixation with the letter. Eventually unable to bear the wretchedness of her existence with Sundar any further, she flees to Gopal for help. Sundar takes the same route, unaware that Radha has gone to Gopal's house. There, matters come to ahead. The overwrought Gopal admits his authorship of the infamous letter to Radha, an admission that almost destroys his friend. Gopal, perceiving no exit from the impasse at which the three have arrived, kills himself with Sundar's pistol. Radha and Sundar are finally reunited but in mourning."

Night of the Vampires,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058106/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mad scientist and his bevy of vampires terrorize a German village. A detective and a witch set out to stop them. A European village is alarmed by a number of unexplained deaths that the local police are unable to solve. The authorities call in Inspector Doren of Interpol, and the only clue the Chief Constable can give the detective is the fact that, each time a murder was committed, the electric lights in the whole neighborhood went out. The locals believe that the killings of the young girls are linked to the vague shadows in the caves under the local castle and to the mysterious Curse of the Green Eyes. They distrust the inspector and offer no assistance when still another murder takes place at the village inn---in the room next to that occupied by the inspector---and the body disappears. There are many suspects: the chattering innkeeper; the mysterious Professor Adelsberg; his manservant John ; the deaf-and-dumb Tom; and the inscrutable doctor, who has been issuing strange death certificates. Doren moves to the castle, where Professor Adelsberg is carrying out some scientific studies. There he meets the Professor's pretty assistant Karin. She is marked as the next victim.—Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net> While he's supposed to be on vacation, Inspector Frank Dorin [Adrian Hoven] is sent
to investigate the deaths of six women. In all cases, the village doctor [Carl Mohner]
has ruled the deaths as natural (heart failure), and the only thing
suspicious is 1) they were all between the ages of 18 and 22, and 2) each
death was accompanied by a one-hour blackout of all electrical power in
the village. On the inspector's first night in the village, his car goes
dead, his flashlight battery dies, he meets Karin Schumann [Karin Field] who is working
as a secretary to Professor von Adelsberg [Wolfgang Preiss] who is conducting blood research
in the castle on the hill, the Professor's assistant Maria is murdered in the room next to
his at the inn, his infrared viewer is stolen from his car by the village deaf guy,
Thomas [Emmerich Schrenk], and he learns of the local superstition about vampires
living in the nearby grottoes.The next morning, on the advice of the innkeeper, Inspector Dorin
goes to see Old Nanny , the village witch. Nanny tells him that the
vampires were forced by a curse into the grottoes over 200 years ago and
that each night they come forth at midnight for one hour minus one minute
looking for blood. Nanny gives Dorin a cross to protect him from the
vampires and a bag of powdered thorns from mountain roses picked at full
bloom on Walpurgisnacht, which will reverse the curse of vampirism if
sprinkled on a freshly-made wound.After his visit with Old Nanny, Dorin is visited by the Professor's manservant
John [John Kitzmiller], who invites him to come and stay at the castle. Dorin
accepts, but first he investigates the grottoes, with John accompanying
him. Other than some loose stalagtites, their search reveals nothing. Upon
returning from the caves, Dorin gets a message from headquarters
instructing him to get a blood test on Maria. Unfortunately, she has
reawakened as a vampire, and her body has disappearedThat night, Dorin moves over to the castle and is pleased to be
greeted by Karin. Later, as Karin changes into her nightgown and prepares
for bed, she notices for the first time that the professor opens locked
doors and casts no reflection in her mirror. As Dorin sleeps, two
vampiresses enter his room through a secret passage behind a large
picture, but they are thwarted by Nanny's cross around his neck.The next morning, Dorin notices the picture, which opens up to reveal
a passage into the caves. Before he gets a chance to explore it, however,
the police drop by to inform him that Maria's body has been found at the
bottom of a well. This allows the doctor to get his blood sample, which
Nanny pours on a snake. The snake dies, and Nanny acclaims it as proof of
vampire blood. Today is also Karin's last day working for the professor.
When she gives him her resignation, he asks her to do one last thing--run
down to the crypt and bring up an old bible.On her way down...down...down the spider-ridden passage to the crypt,
a gate suddenly swings shut, and Karin is trapped. Fortunately, John
notices that Karin has vanished, tells Dorin, and Dorin goes looking for
her. In making their way out of the crypt, they happen upon a coffin that
looks recently slept in and contains a book of instructions for vampires.
As they read the book, the doctor arrives with the news that Maria's body
has disappeared again and that the power is out to the whole village. They
search for Maria's body but find nothing, so they send Karin back to the
castle while they continue to search.Along the way back to the castle, Karin is attacked by Maria. Her
screams bring Dorin and the doctor running, but it is too late.
Fortunately, Dorin remembers Nanny's antivampire powder, sprinkles it on
Karin's wounds, and she is saved. Nanny then gives Dorin a stake and
hammer and explains how to use them on the Master in order to free the
village of the vampires' curse. The doctor and the villagers search the
village while Dorin, John, and Karin (with her shirt open and black bra
showing) search the grottoes. They find the professor lying in his coffin
and easily stake him. As he bursts into flames, Maria dies again and Dorin
gives Karin his jacket to cover up her bra. As John carries Maria's body
out of the grotto, he turns back to Dorin and says, ""Vampires...I do
believe!""Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl"

Italiani brava gente,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059323/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Chronicle of the unheralded and unsuccessful invasion of the Soviet Union by the Italian army during World War II. During the summer of 1941, Germany and its European allies invade the Soviet Union. Fascist Italy participates at the invasion. The first trains carrying Italian soldiers arrive in the Soviet Union during grain-harvest season. The Soviet Army withdrew during the initial German onslaught that spearheaded the invasion. The newly arrived Italian soldiers wonder at the size of the Soviet countryside that seems to never end. The soldiers also notice the Soviets withdrew so fast that many fields have not been harvested yet. Fields of wheat, sunflower and corn glow golden under the bright summer sun. The Italians attempt to make friends with the Soviet civilians whom they meet at various stopping points along the way. But the civilians are scared of the invaders and rightfully so. The German troops have already passed through, terrorizing the Soviet populace. The Italian soldiers even try to share their bread rations with the civilians and they try to cheer the Russians up by singing a left-wing anthem, the Internationale. The Italian officers tolerate this, but things get out of hand when all the Soviet prisoners, and civilians alike, join in a chorus of defiance by singing the anthem. The German military police intervenes with brutality, causing a rift between the Italian and German soldiers. A German staff car appears and the Italians are given a lesson in how to treat one's enemy by the German commander. The Germans view their Italian allies as soft, undisciplined, militarily inferior and ideologically unreliable. The appearance of the Italian colonel in charge of the newly arrived Italian troops calms the spirits. A few of the Soviet civilians who, during the confrontation between Germans and Italians, escaped in the countryside, are slowly recaptured, one by one. Some are shot by the Germans. The Italian division occupies its established position. Later, they are entrusted with crossing the major Bug River. Despite their heavy losses, the Italians cross the Bug river and push the resisting Soviet troops further east. The Germans attempt to take credit for the forcing of the Bug river but the Italian colonel ensures that his troops get the credit. Grudgingly accepting the outcome, the German commanders congratulate the Italian commanders. The Italians continue their advance, on the flanks or behind the crack German units that spearhead the attack. On the wake of the Germans, the Italian troops find only destruction, death, mayhem and terrorized Soviet civilian survivors. During the fall, fanatical units of the Italian Fascist Militia arrive. They are commanded by a fanatical Fascist officer, Major Ferro Maria Ferri. They reinforce the regular units of the Italian Army. They also treat the Soviets with brutality, just like the Germans. The humanitarian Italian soldiers dislike the Italian Fascists just like they detest the Germans. When the winter arrives, the Italians, just like their German allies, discover that without winter clothing and equipment they face a cruel fate. News of Stalingrad make them uneasy. The Soviets rally a huge number of divisions and they launch several counter-offensives on the entire length of the front. The Italians and the Germans are caught unprepared and are reeling from the powerful Soviet blows. Outnumbered, outgunned and outmaneuvered, the Italians fight-on, with heroism and bravery, to cover the withdrawal of the more important German units. The Germans have sacrificed and abandoned the Italian troops in order to be able to flee. Some Italians try to surrender to the Soviets, encouraged by the Soviet propaganda leaflets dropped by airplanes on their positions urging them to surrender to good treatment at the hands of the Soviet troops. The Italian officers, try to dissuade their men from surrendering to the enemy. It's a matter of pride, more than ideology. Overrun by the Soviet hordes, the remaining Italian soldiers commence their withdrawal. But it's too late.—nufs68 The film tells about the soldiers of the Italian expeditionary forces who fought in World War II with the USSR on the side of Nazi Germany.

After a brief bar fight, Bud, and his new side-kick, Slim, ride out of town seeking shelter in the desert, and reluctantly join forces with the wanted outlaw, Carson, to get hold of the money. But, before long, Bud and Slim find themselves double-crossed, and if it weren't for Sergeant Warwick and his convoy transporting provisions to Fort Alamo, they would be dead. Now, posing as a U.S. Cavalry lieutenant, Bud must lead the unit through hostile territory, as Janet, a fiery redhead, and multitudes of Indians, who prepare for the final ambush, further complicate matters. Is this the end of the road to Alamo?—Nick Riganas The Wild West, 1864. Bud (Ken Clark) is a drifter riding though sparse terrain, only to discover a carriage of murdered Union soldiers. Stopping to survey the damage, he notices that one of the men is still alive. The soldier dies before he can explain what happened, but Bud notices that he is clutching a satchel in his fingers. Upon opening the satchel, Bud finds a requisition form for $150,000. He then rides into a nearby town to report his discovery.Upon his arrival in Wagon City, Bud arrives at the police station where he is told that the sheriff is taking a siesta and cannot be disturbed. While waiting in the nearby saloon, Bud observes a car game being played between a wealthy, well-dressed man named Mr. Silver (Gerard Herter), and a young gunslinger named Slim (Alberto Cevenini). Bud notices that Mr. Silver is cheating, and confronts him. A bar fight ensues between the crooked Mr. Silver and Bud. At this point, the sheriff arrives. But since Bud is a stranger in town who is raising an accusation against a ""well respected citizen"" like Mr. Silver, the pompous and easily fooled sheriff ignores Bud and tries to arrest him. However, Bud manages to escape from the saloon and rides out of town with his new side-kick, Slim.Bud and Slim hide out in the nearby desert, and their friendship strengthens as they reveal more about themselves. Bud explains that he refused to take sides during the war, and when he left his Kentucky ranch for a brief period, he returned to find his family slaughtered and his house burned to the ground by unknown assailants. In compensation for this, the U.S. government gave him a worthless promissory note. Bud now wonders aimlessly, looking for an opportunity to make some money so he can rebuild his ranch. Slim explains that he knows an outlaw named Carson (Michel Lemoine), who might be of some financial help. In a meeting between Bud and Carson, Bud is wisely suspicious of him, but his anxiousness to re-build his ranch causes him to ally himself with the dubious man. Remembering the murdered Union soldiers, Bud tells Carson and his men about his find and together they pilfer the uniforms and pretend to be Union soldiers.Taking the requisition form with them, Bud, Slim, Carson and his men ride into Wagon City where they go to the bank and pressure the teller into handing them the $150,000. The plan nearly works, but Carson's impatience results in him drawing a gun on the teller, and killing him in cold blood, as well as several innocent bystanders at the bank. The men flee back to the cave, which is Carson's hideout, with the stolen money. Now aware that they are all wanted outlaws, Bud suggests that it would be best if they divide the loot and all of them go their separate ways. But instead, the greedy Carson knocks Bud and Slim unconscious, leaving them behind while he and his men ride off with all the ill-gotten cash for themselves.Left for death on a rural country road, But and Slim are discovered by a passing troop of Union soldiers. As they are still dressed in blue Union outfits, they are accepted as soldiers by the autocratic and slow-witted commanding officer Captain Howard (Antonio Gradoli). However, the wily Sergeant Carter (Gustave De Nardo) is not so easily fooled, and immediately senses that Bud and Slim are not who they claim to be. But Howard refuses to let Carter make any background check on the men and keeps him in check. Carters suspicions are confirmed when he slyly forces Bud to admit that he attended military school in Annapolis, Maryland which is actually a Naval academy. But Carter is astute enough to realize that Bud and Slim are decent people, so he treats them with dignity and respect while deciding what to do about them.Bud and Slim plan to escape from their Union companions when they reach Fort Alamo, where their subterfuge will surely be discovered. But, Bud decides to stay for a while when he realizes that the Ozark Indians have targeted the convoy they are in. Bud explains to Slim that innocent women and children are among the Union convoy and he could not live with himself if they were senselessly slaughtered. Slim reluctantly agrees to stay out of loyalty to Bud. A little later, Bud and Slim are joined by Carson, who is the sole survivor of an Indian attack, and who is still in possession of most of the stolen money. Because Carson is still wearing his stolen Union uniform, Bud is able to convince Captain Howard that Carson is a member of his own troop.Soon after, Captain Howard puts the entire convoy in danger when he insists on passing thought an Ozark cemetery. Sergeant Carter does his best to explain that passing though such territory will incite the Indians. But Captain Howard takes offence at being questioned, and blithely kicks aside the religious paraphernalia. True to Carters expectations, the troops soon find themselves in an all-out war with the Indians.Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Bud and Janet (Jany Clair), a young woman who is being transported to jail at Fort Alamo for killing an officer who assaulted her. She tells Bud that her major crime is that she is desirable in a world dominated by brutally amoral males. This is emphasized when she is attacked and nearly raped by Carson, who is put under arrest by Sergeant Carter. Under guard, Carson makes an appeal to Bud to help him escape so they can split the money between them if they abandon the others.

Cinq filles en furie,1964,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182891/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two branches of the same family fight for the love of a handsome Spanish poacher, and to retrieve the location of a treasure hidden by an ancestor during WWII, which secret is guarded by Marthe, their spinster aunt. Five girls spend their holidays in an old mansion in the middle of a farm in southern France, near Soledor. The lady of the house has a secret that the five wild girls will try to discover. They assume it is a hidden treasure somewhere, but it is only a way to hide a dramatic fact that concerns one of the girls.—Artemis-9 [Based on the US video version of the movie. Characters are given with French/English names when first introduced; then, the English names are used, as currently the French language version is not available to the public.]Colomba/Isabel (Maria Tamar), in gray shirt, jeans and leather boots, and an ammunition belt around her waist, is hunting in the raven mountain range of Soledor, in the Hérault, France.Her younger sister Gladys/Jenny (Madeleine Constant), a short hair blonde in beach shorts, white shirt and open sandals, is petting nearby with the gypsy poacher Manuel/Blackie (Marc Bonseignour).
Isabel shoots at a tree branch, right on the mark, and Jenny locates her and goes to meet her. Isabel seems to disapprove that Jenny is hunting for men.With Isabel is her blonde and silent close friend Sylvaine/Sylvia (Marie-France Mignal), in a white dress, either unease in the presence of Jenny, or too timid to take part in the conversation.At the family farmhouse in decay, Marthe/Martha (Colette Régis), an old and alcoholic spinster, is hiding a bottle of red wine in the dog house - just when the three young women were coming back, and Isabel notices the maneuver. She orders Jenny to hold the dog back, and shoots the bottle inside the dog house.
When they go in, Martha is setting the table in the patio, under the sunshine, but she is not happy with the presence of her uninvited guests.Isabel comments to Sylvia that she would like to make the old woman talk, and asks Jenny if she's found anything.
Jenny, who's listening to light music in a battery-operated telephony, says, ""Nothing in a hundred yards!"" (92 meters) Then she adds,""I got tired!... It was pretty rough going...""
Isabel asks Martha about the ""old road"", if her father ever told about it. Aunt Martha's answer is not helpful, either. Isabel turns back to a map she's spread on the table. She complains she can't think with the music distracting her, and tells Jenny to look over the cliff the next day.
Sylvia is afraid of the danger the cliff represents, but Jenny says that she's not afraid of heights, ""I get all excited!""Next morning, with the radio by her side, Jenny is sunbathing topless at the edge of the cliff. She's surprised by the arrival of a jeep, and puts on her bikini - the bra and the swimming trunks over her slip - and goes down to meet the newcomers.Gilles/George (Michel Montfort) , the topographical engineer supervising the construction of a river canal, offers two girls to take them to the farm, but they refuse. He leaves, and Jenny runs to the farm to give advance warning of the new arrivals.The two young women used to play in that region five years before they left: Françoise/Viola (Nicole Mérouze) is a blonde who keeps her short hair in place with a headband, and her sister Agnès/Agnes (Denyse Roland), a blonde with long hair. Though this visit is also unexpected, Martha receives well her ""dear children"" - actually daughters of her late sister Mary. Martha had told them by letter that her other nieces ""had stolen all the money she had"", and they're not happy to see Isabel and Jenny arrive at a quick step, with Sylvia by their side.
The dialogue between Isabel and Viola is harsh, and it's obvious that neither pair of sisters was there for holidays, but with a purpose.
Martha interrupts them, ""My darling nieces! No one of you'll ever touch the treasure! That treasure is accursed! [To Viola, she adds,] It was your mother's wish, and I respect it!""Viola tells her, ""I understand,"" and leads Agnes to the detached house next to the main house, not before giving Sylvia a funny look, ""You're Sylvia, aren't you?"" This gets her no answer, but leaves Isabel - who's sweet on the timid art student from Paris - in rage. Turning to Martha, Isabel reproves that she would not keep her mouth shut about the treasure.
Sylvia stays with Martha, showing compassion, but Martha does not reply to her.Isabel mounts with Jenny to her cousins' bedroom, and asks Viola out for a conversation - while still carrying the hunting shotgun, and before Viola finishes unpacking. Viola follows her, but without her noticing, she hides a large flick-blade under her white sweater.
In the enclosed yard, Martha is curious about the two cousins leaving, but now it's Sylvia who doesn't answer her. Jenny stood alone with Agnes, and is trying some dresses in front of the wardrobe's mirror.Isabel shoots at a tree branch to impress Viola, before arguing with her about the hidden treasure. Viola accuses her and Jenny of squandering Martha's money, instead of thanking them for having raised them after their mother's death.
Isabel shoots her gun in the air, but then recharges the gun - pointing it to Viola, who pulls open her flick-blade. Viola throws the knife's blade right between Isabel's boots, and teases her, ""You'd like to know if I believe that treasure exists, don't you?"" She recuperates her knife, and adds, ""Well, I'll tell you. Like you, I read those papers and letters that Martha sent to my mother."" [Mary, sister of Martha and John.]
""You hadn't heard about it before?"" interrupts Isabel.
""Sure, but no one believed that story about the dropped gold by parachute, it was a war story!""
""So, it was the letters that decided you to come,"" asks Isabel.
""The letters, and you! If you didn't knew about it, you'd not have been here for months.""
""Go on... Do you intend to find it by yourself?""
""No, with my sister.""
When Viola is retrieving her knife, Isabel goes after her close, and shouts, ""My father's money belongs to me!""
Viola takes, the open flick-blade in hand. ""No! Your father's money, as you call it, that they dropped by parachute, was really stolen money. And now, it's lost money. The finders, the keepers... And the money is cursed, don't forget what Martha says.""
The argument goes on, Isabel denying Viola's any rights to the money. ""I'm making you a proposition,"" and Isabel shoots her gun right between Viola's feet.
""And this is my answer!"" Viola replies, throwing the knife into a tree trunk inches away from Isabel's head.At the cousins' bedroom, Agnes suggests to Jenny that they would do better searching for the treasure together, and asks her who Sylvia is.
Jenny says that Isabel never wanted to have a man after she'd lost her child, and Sylvia, an art school student, was her only company in Paris, who she considered like a sister.
Jenny has put a robe on, and asks Agnes out, to show her her sports convertible, that she uses to drive in the evenings to the beach.
""Alone?"" asks Agnes.
""Never alone!..."" answers Jenny giggling. Then she tells her that Blackie, the gypsy, is her man, and suggests she may help Agnes find a boyfriend, too.
""I'm not in hunger... But that guy who drove us here today... that'd be different.""
Jenny inform her cousin that George is after Sylvia, and that she's seen them together several times.
""Sylvia?! I'd never guess it.""
""They just hold hands,"" says Jenny, and both young women start laughing out loud.
Jenny drives fast, and makes a dangerous stop just at the cliff's edge. While enjoying the view, the two cousins talk about the parachuted gold.
Jenny says that when the treasure had been buried, only a few young men in the village knew about it, and all of them had been killed.
Agnes comments that as the gold had been parachuted on the 3rd, and Jenny's father had been arrested on the 6th, he had less 3 days to hide it.
Jenny agrees: ""It must be between here and the valley, about 9 miles..."" (15 km)At home, Isabel is talking with her sister, and studying the map on which she has marked the probable location of the hidden gold.
""With the letters Martha wrote to aunt Mary,"" Isabel says, ""they'll have figured that, too, and with what Martha has told them...""
Sylvia sits by, in silence, and Jenny dances to the radio music, not paying attention. Matha is knitting at the end of the room, pretending not to be listening.
The dog barking outside alerts the women to something. Isabel goes out to calm Luke, the dog, and sees Agnes' prominent breasts pushing forward under her sweater from behind a door jamb outside. Swiftly, Isabel picks up the shotgun inside, and comes out again, to shoot a warning shot at Agnes, as she ran away to the safety of her room in the detached house.""You see?! She'll murder is one day!"" says Agnes to Viola, who kept doing her fingernails on the bed, very calm.
""Don't worry, she's only bluffing.""Isabel hangs her shotgun by the door, and sits again at table. ""Well, we can't go on with the digging now, they'll be watching us every minute.""
Jenny retorts, ""Say... Those letters you mentioned... Why don't we steal them?""
Isabel cautions Jenny, ""Viola knows how to use her knife. She gave me a demonstration this afternoon.""
A klaxon downstairs. Sylvia stands up and picks a light sweater, making for the door.
""Where are you going?"" asks Isabel.
""I need some fresh air,"" Sylvia answers. ""good night.""Isabel is sour. From the other house, with the lights out, the two cousins are spying on Sylvia's departure in the engineer's jeep. Then, already in their twin beds, Agnes tells Viola that she's seen that Isabel has a map. But the conversation turns to Sylvia and George, sex and love; then Agnes finds a rag doll in a chest of drawers.
""It's Bella!... Remember her? How I loved to play with her.""
""Don't come at me crying for your childhood. We didn't come here to cry about the past...""
""What's wrong with the past? To you, only the present counts!""
""And the future. We came here with a purpose, remember? Don't you know?!""
The dog barks again. Agnes in her see-through baby-doll spies from the window. ""Jenny! She's taking her car. She is not with anyone.""
""Follow her!"" decides Viola, jumping out of bed in her pajamas. She hands a long leather coat to Agnes.
""What for?""
""Sylvia and George... and the Engineer. Jenny and Blackie... he was born here, he knows all region by heart...""Jenny comes at a run through the woods, to embrace and kiss with Blackie near the cliff. She complains that she can't stand her cousins spying on her at home. He doesn't know who the cousins are, but she tells him that they were the two girls that used to play with them in the woods. That brings him a memory, and makes both laugh... He picks her in his arms, and menaces to through her out of the cliff - but instead they have sex.
Agnes managed to catch them kissing wildly and rolling together on the grass, and laying on her back, she opens her leather coat, and masturbates in her slip.Meanwhile, Sylvia and George are exchanging words of love side by side, then he attempts to give her a light kiss, and she says it's time to get back home. So he drives her back in the jeep. Isabel is smoking, waiting nervously in her conservative sleeping shirt, and when
Sylvia arrives, she stares at her. Sylvia stares her back in silence, and Isabel slaps her. Sylvia hides her face on the bed pillow, sobbing.Next morning, Agnes wakes up early, and runs from her house to Isabel's room, to find her and Sylvia still asleep. Then she goes to Jenny's room, and wakes her up, demanding, ""Jenny! Where is she?""
""Who?""
""Stop playing games and answer me.""
""How should I know?""
""I hope for your sake that nothing happened to her."" Jenny simply turns round, to get back to sleep.
Meanwhile, Blackie is already hunting, and setting traps for rabbits. He sees Agnes asleep, her nude legs protruding from the leather coat.
He starts chatting with her, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Viola.
They start talking about the past, and Blackie comments that he has a grudge with the engineer, because he did not allow him to stay in the land where he used to live. ""One day I'll get him when he is not looking...""
Then, Viola asks him about the parachute story. Blackie was 10-year-old then, and has no valuable information for her.Jenny visits George at the public works site and shows her appreciation for the big machines at work. He tells her their names: the ""big machine"" is a bulldozer, and the ""big monster over there"" is a trench-digger.Isabel, all made up in a white dress and high heels, pays a visit to George at the site too; after an hesitation when she sees he is talking with the blonde, she asks about his work, and he tells her it will be finished by October, ""The whole region will be under water.""
She hides her worry by turning her head, then puts on a smile and compliments him for ""a real job for a real man,"" and she asks him for a detailed map of the region, which he promptly offers to her. Jenny is not pleased by the way George looks and smiles back at Isabel...
Then they leave, Isabel first, then Jenny, the second after being invited to accompany George to the evening's fiesta in the village.At home, Agnes, wearing trunks and a white shirt with the flaps tied in front, is prodding Martha gently, while she takes care of a bunch of flowers. Martha is not answering most of the questions, but then she says she had to come to take care of John - Agnes' uncle. ""It was then that your mother... oh... let's forget about the past!""
To change the conversation, Agnes tells Martha that ""Viola is going to the village. is there something special she may bring you from the store? A bottle of whiskey for example, hum?""
Martha's eyes smile for the first time, but then she turns her attention to the flowers again: ""Isabel doesn't want me to drink...""
Agnes starts speaking against Isabel, and Martha interrupts her. ""They came back to look for me!""
Agnes replies that the only reason they came was to look for the gold.Viola is coming from the village with the groceries - and a bottle of whiskey - but she stays behind to stop the engineer who is driving from the site.
She chats him up, confessing that she'd waited for him on hearing the motor of his jeep. He lights a cigarette, and offers her a lift, which she declines. ""I forgot that you like to walk,"" he comments.
She talks about the the local wilderness. ""It's beautiful,"" he comments. ""It's exciting,"" she adds, ""But alone, you can't appreciate the beauties of nature.""
George takes the bottle out of her plastic net bag, asking, ""Is this to console you for your loneliness?""
She laughs, ""Hum... Any objections?""
""None at all.""
""Unless you can suggest any other consolation.""
""How about coming to the gypsy Fiesta? There will be lots of young men there. Are you going?""
""Naturally. The whole village will be there...""
As he is about to re-start the motor, she says, ""By the way. I'd like to ask you... Could you possibly get me a detailed map of the area?""
""For you, too?""
""Too?!"" Her surprise is bigger than his.
""Why not, I already provided one for your cousin Isabel.""
He departs slowly, as the< road is taken by a flock of sheep. Viola is speechless.Jenny and Sylvia in dresses say good-bye to Martha, knitting by the fireplace, and Isabel at table with the new map, in the main room. Isabel comments, ""You're dressed like a couple of streetwalkers.""
""Keep the compliments to yourself,"" says Jenny, as Sylvia turns her face away.
After a crisp exchange, Jenny says, ""It won't help you finding that treasure keeping looking at that map.""
Isabel reproves them for thinking of nothing but sex, and Jenny gently takes Sylvia to the door.
Isabel goes after them, and calls for her. Sylvia stops at the end of the staircase.
""You're following her... like a sheep!""
""I see..."" Isabel makes several attempts to dissuade Sylvia to mix herself ""with those gypsies"", and she ends by replying, ""Sometimes I've wished to be one of them.""
In anguish, Isabel is about to slap the girl, but she is determined to go, and her stare stops Isabel's left hand in the air.At a dilapidated palace or church, about two dozen people are gathered to watch a gypsy girl is dancing Flamenco style, with the rhythm set by a guitarist and a man clapping hands.Viola sees that Blackie is looking intensely at Sylvia, and addresses him, ""She's gone out with the Engineer...""
George arrives then, and goes to sit by Sylvia. When George puts his hand on Sylvia's shoulder, Blackie leaves the room.
Jenny goes after Blackie. When the dance ends, George and Sylvia also leave.Jenny and Blackie are petting on the grass, but he is aloof. ""What's the matter?"" ""I'm thinking. You think that with money, you can have anything you want.""
""Most of...""
""But some things can't be bought.""
""Perhaps...""
""What's it exactly? That thing of treasure of yours...""
""Not you, too!..."" Jenny says, annoyed at the prospect her evening is ruined.Under the moonlight, George attempts to kiss Sylvia again, but again she stops him, though she says she loves him.Viola is teasing Blackie again, who's returned to the fiesta. He's drinking wine from a water-skin that he took from another spectator. Then, he takes her by the hand, and starts a round dance around the small stage where the dancer was, joined by several spectators.Meanwhile, Sylvia is trying to persuade George that Isabel is not bad. ""She was not married, and had a baby here. She let Martha take care of him, and she went back to Paris. One day, the baby disappeared, they searched all over, but the baby was never found.""Meanwhile, Blackie keeps drinking from the water-skin, and dancing on the stage with the long haired gypsy girl. When the dance finishes, he descends, and tries to embrace Sylvia, who refuses him, ""You're drunk!""
George pulls him back by the arm, and Jenny interposes herself between the two men. ""Stop it, will you?""
""You the Engineer, I'll catch you one of these days..."" He spits at George's feet, and leaves, accompanied by Jenny.At home, Martha reproaches Isabel's attitude, and she tells her to shut up. Martha is fed up with silence, now, and tries to convince Isabel that she's trying to get the treasure instead of something she knows she can't have, and that she's ruining her life for it. Martha says that Sylvia has the right to live her life.
Isabel reproaches her cousins for letting Martha drink, and becoming whores, and reproaches Martha for wishing to be poor, and confined to that place.
""Isabel... it wasn't my fault! You know how careful I always was.""
""It was my fault. I shouldn't have let him with a drunkard.""
""I wasn't then. I started drinking because of what happened.""
Isabel shouts, ""Shut up, now! I don't want to hear about it! I don't want to hear about it!... I'll find the gold. I'll find the gold and get out of here for good.""
Martha stands up, and caresses Isabel's shoulders, ""My child! My child, my Isabel!...""
Isabel, sobering up: ""Leave me alone. I've got work to do.""
Martha sits in her chair, sobbing in silence, like Isabel does.Next morning, Sylvia asks Martha where Isabel is. ""She left early, slamming the door.""
Viola is applying lipstick with a small round hand-mirror at the window, and listening to the conversation in the yard.
""And the others?""
""I don't know,"" says Martha, waving her hand and going into the house.
Sylvia goes out into the wood looking for her cousins, wearing her trademark pleated skirt and a shirt with the flaps knotted in front, revealing her belly.
Blackie sees her, and follows her.
Sylvia sees Blackie looking at her from the top of a low cliff, and is suddenly afraid. She runs away, only to be cornered against a rocky wall, and attacked by him. She fights back to no avail, he rips her shirt, and forcibly kisses her.At the farm, Viola sits with Martha, and drinks with her from the Haig's bottle she brought from the shop.Agnes, wearing black trousers and white shirt, found her way to Blackie's stone hamlet, and waits for him. When he arrives, she asks him about a wild plant with thorns that grows over the hamlet. He says they call it ""crown of Christ"".
""Where does it grow?""
""I don't know, over there, in the grottoes...""
""Exactly where?""
""Why all the questions?""
""Tell me!""
""In the ravine, there..."" Blackie points with his jaw. ""They don't grow any place else.""
""Could you take me there?""
""Yeah, sure... But what for?""
""Wait for me - I'll get Viola!"" and Agnes departs at a run.Jenny, in a white skirt with a belt and white knotted shirt showing her stomach, has found Isabel, who's hunting again with her shotgun. They see Agnes running on the top a cliff, coming from Blackie's place, and they wonder why.Isabel surprises Blackie working by his hamlet with a pick-ax.
""Blackie!"" he turns his head, and sees Isabel pointing the shotgun at him. ""What was Agnes doing around here?"" he starts walking, and she shoots at the ground between his feet.
""She wanted to know where the treasure was.""
""Did you tell her?""
""Yes, I told her, so what?""
""Where is it?""
""You too?... How come you're all so anxious to know? I can show you some other things...""
She shoots again, over his shoulder. Blackie says again, ""It's over there, in the ravine,"" and as Isabel looks away from him, he quickly grabs his shotgun and jumps over a dilapidated wall of loose stones.
Isabel takes cover, too, and they exchange shots, as Jenny moves away from Isabel. In between shots, Blackie taunts Isabel, saying that her whole family is crazy, that Viola told him about the treasure, and that he had raped ""your queer Sylvia"".
That last remark makes Isabel take better aim, and the shot is so close to Blackie's head that splinters of rock hurt him near the left eye.
She stops shooting, Jenny calls her a bitch, and runs to Blackie, to take care of him.Isabel orders Jenny to tie him up with a piece of cord he uses for traps, which she does, but when Isabel has walked away, Jenny places Blackie's flick-blade close to his head on the ground.At home, Martha continues to speak with Viola. Now her voice dragging for having drunk too much, she tells her secret, ""Isabel came to have a child here, went back to Paris, and I raised him here. He was one year old when it happened... When I came back home, he wasn't there... The police came and searched all over, but they never... never found any traces of him.
Isabel never had anything to do with it. It was my fault... I don't feel well.""
Viola helps the woman stand, and takes her up to bed. Martha is groggy, but she picks up the bottle, to take with her.Sylvia returns and goes up - seeing from the door that Martha is asleep on her chair, and Viola is searching the main room's cupboard. Hearing steps, she hides, and sees Agnes running up to Viola's room.
Then, Agnes comes down again, and runs up to the main house - where she surprises Viola, who's finally found Isabel's map.
Agnes reveals what she learned from Blackie, that the plant they're searching is at the ravine.The two sisters come down to the yard just in time to see Sylvia running away - after she took the letters and the switchblade that Viola had left on the table.
Viola hands the map to Agnes, telling her to prepare their suitcases, and then to meet with her at the ravine. Then, Viola arms herself with a long twig, and runs after Sylvia, wearing her light white cotton dress with a white belt.Knowing the surroundings better than the girl from Paris, Viola blocks her path, with the long twig in her hand, demanding, ""Give my letters back, or I'll kill you!""
Sylvia confronts her in silence, and pulls open the flick-blade. Viola smiles mockingly, and attacks, beating the flick-blade out of the girl's hand, leaving a long blood graze on it.
Viola rushes the girl and beats her shoulders as she kneels on the rough ground, but Sylvia grabs at Viola's knees and pulls her close, making her trip and fell on her back.
Sylvia attacks Viola, and they roll around, pulling hair, Sylvia manages to bite Viola's lower leg, but she is soon losing to Viola's strength.
Sylvia disengages and runs away, crying out for help, and eventually she's heard by George who was driving the jeep on the country road nearby.
Viola catches up with Sylvia, who fell before reaching the road, gets astride her and is about to strangle her, when George comes in a hurry, protecting Sylvia.
Viola still demands the map back, but George' stare at her forces her to step back, and go away without it.George takes the girl in his arms, she's sobbing, and tells him, ""I'm so ashamed... Manuel..."" - a reference to having been raped by the poacher.Isabel and Jenny return home and finds Martha asleep, and find that the map is gone. She re-arms herself with more bullets, and is about to leave when George arrives with Sylvia.
George tells Jenny, ""You take care of Sylvia, I've got something to settle."" Sylvia pleads with him not to go, ""He'll kill you!...""
""Wait!"" Isabel says, ""I'll hand him to you.""
But George leaves first, to confront Blackie. He drives his jeep, then arms himself with a revolver, and goes on foot up hill.Meanwhile, Blackie manages to cut off his bonds with the knife Jenny left by him.

I know what you read in that letter, but there never was a war treasure, I made it all up!""
You asked me questions, what was I up to say? So I told you there was a treasure. Your father was arrested two days before the parachute fell here, but I was the only one who knew that. So I told you the place was cursed. [Isabel starts moving] Nobody moves! Please forgive me, forgive me, Isabel. It wasn't my fault, but you wouldn't listen to me [sobbing], but you wouldn't listen to me [walks back from the cliff], but you wouldn't listen to me!...""

Mark and his two friends Dave and Tommy are elementary school students who are having lunch outside of the school building. During lunch, the three boys discuss their plans for Halloween. Mark tells his friends that he plans to explore a nearby old decrepit Victorian House on Elm Street known as ""the old Finch Place,"" and dares his friends to join him on his quest. Obviously, the house is believed to be haunted by many kids in the neighborhood. While they're on their way to the house, the old lady at the Finch place is struggling to get her pet cat Lucifer out of a tree. Mark's two friends get close enough to the house but run away at the last minute. Just then Mark arrives at the house and is caught by the old lady, who coerces him into climbing the tree to retrieve her cat. When he gets close enough, the tree branch breaks causing him to fall to the ground as the cat jumps out of the tree.As he wakes up, the film changes from black and white to color, and he discovers the old lady is a witch after all. Additionally, the house changed from a wooden Victorian structure to a stone cottage, and the old lady explains what happened when he tried to rescue her cat. She also admits to being a witch, and make him realize his fear of witches is groundless. As a reward for helping her retrieve her cat, the witch gives him a ring with an image of Santa Claus, containing the seed for a tree, which grows at an astoundingly abnormal rate and comes to life to grants three wishes. She informs him that getting the tree to work requires three magic words (apparently ""Rembum, Karrynum, Pom."")Within a month, Mark is at the dinner table on Thanksgiving, seeking a piece of turkey with a wishbone (a key ingredient to the spell), but his father Henry refuses to give it to him, until his mother urges him to do so. That night, he talks to his pet turtle Icabod, and refreshes his memory on the steps to getting his magic Christmas tree to work. He goes out to the back yard, plants the seed, says the three words, and with a clap of thunder and lighting, the tree appears instantly as he runs back in the house.The next day, his parents are at the breakfast nook, where Henry is baffled over the lack of newspaper coverage over the thunderstorm from the previous night. Mark's father struggles to start his lawn mower, but once he does, he doesn't seem to have any control of the mower. While his mother is talking on the telephone, she notices he collides with this new tree that seemed to spring up out of nowhere. His mother comes out to investigate and when his father tells her what happened, she jokes that he should use the axe if he wants to chop the tree down. After she returns to the house, he trips over his broken lawn mower as Mark's pet turtle casually eats the grass and weeds in the family's back yard. Later, Henry spends much of his time trying to chop the tree down, but not a single ax or saw has any effect on it. Eventually he gives up and let's it stay in his yard.On Christmas Eve, Mark's parents and older sister are preparing some last minute Christmas shopping. Mark himself decides to stay home claiming he's going to wrap some presents. In reality, he just wants to check on his tree. He inspects the tree and finds out it suddenly starts to talk. The tree urges him to say the magic words, and the tree arrives inside, fully decorated. The first of these wishes involves having an hour of power, which includes transforming vases in the house, turning nighttime into daylight and causing chaos in town. He sees a man picking up potato chip boxes to place in the back of his rental truck, which suddenly takes off. He makes a local police car take off and chase the man and his truck, while the cop chases the car. He makes a pie man and his wife throw pies in each other's faces and chase each other around town. He makes an antique fire truck escape from the local fire department, and though the firemen catch the truck, they have no control over where it goes or what it does. The pie man hits one of the firemen, and the rented stake truck chases the squabbling couple.After he's done with that chaos, he returns home just before his parents arrive and his father discovers the tree is missing. Shortly afterwards, he and the rest of the family discovers it's already indoors and decorated. Mark makes his second wish, to have Santa Claus all to himself. The tree tries to talk him out such a wish, but he refuses to be persuaded. Santa suddenly appears in the living room between Mark and the tree, just as he was about to climb into his sleigh at the North Pole. Mark introduces Santa to the tree, who practically confesses he's an unwilling participant in Mark's selfish activities. The boy demands that he won't let Father Christmas go until he gets everything he wants. Later that night, Mark wanders off and Santa and the tree discuss the error of his ways.Despite the fact that it's nighttime at home, Mark walks through a riverbed in the woods during the day with an apparent shotgun, when in a pre-Beatles example of instant karma, he encounters a hairy giant who tried to claim him as his property. This giant is supposed to represent greed, and exposes the boy's hypocrisy over kidnapping Santa Claus. He urges the giant to let him go if he promises to be less greedy. Not entirely convinced of Mark's promise to let Santa go, he forces him to look into the river, which turns into a movie screen showing all the consequences of him keeping Jolly Ol' St. Nick. His actions cause panic at the United Nations, increased military activity, a drastic decline in the stock market, and of course billions of children never to receive the toys they asked for.Finally, Mark's third wish is to undo the previous wish. He pleads for forgiveness from Santa Claus, who gladly complies. Santa disappears, and the tree tells him their time together is about to end as he returns to ""the land of magic."" Mark flops in the chair and wishes the tree a tearful goodbye. The film returns to black and white, and Mark himself returns to the yard of the Old Finch Place, in it's Victorian origins, with the old lady watching over him as he recuperates from his fall. The old lady shows her appreciation by offering him a serving of milk and cookies. As she goes into the house to get them, he realizes his whole ordeal was a dream, which suddenly zooms back into color to a nearby forest where another pine tree, who also turns out to be a magic Christmas tree (albeit in a different voice), urges him and kids everywhere to believe that there is magic in all Christmas trees."

When they come face to face, there are sparks flying everywhere... Driven, meticulous, accomplished, and above all, successful in her profession at a young age, the beautiful civil engineer, Lila Vassiliou, has everything her male colleagues ever wished for. Impeccable in her crisp and fashionable suits, the brilliant but stern expert is, by all means, immaculate; however, poor Lila is utterly out of touch with her feminine side, and surprisingly bad at recognising her subordinate Alekos' audacious flirtation. Under those circumstances, only the magic touch of Lila's cousin, Athena, can help the respectable manager get back on track, even if she is still sceptical about the wonderfully painless and pampering makeover experience that awaits her. What a pity. Lila would be surprised how far can one go with a little dab of bold blood-red lipstick and a soft, melodious voice.—Nick Riganas Lila Vasileiou (Jenny Karezi) is a young architect who is dedicated to her studies and her work. One of her former Professors (Periklis Hristoforidis) trusts her to run the construction company he manages while he is away on a business trip abroad for a few months. On her first day to work she is escorted to her office by her father Thomas (Dionysis Papagianopoulos). On that very day Alekos Samiotakis (Alekos Alexandrakis) returns to Athens from Northern Greece where he was on business. He is a well-known playboy and when he finds Lila alone in the office he starts hitting on her thinking that she is the secretary of the new manager. Lila is annoyed and sends him to hell. The Professor comes back to his office together with the president of the company (Dimitris Nikolaidis) another member of the board, Mr. Makrakis (Aggelos Antonopoulos) and Alekos to introduce them to his replacement. Alekos realises to his surprise that Lila is his boss and from then on tries to behave appropriately. He even refuses to smoke in front of her due to respect. Lila is upset and confides in her cousin Athina (Lili Papayanni) that everyone in the company sees her as a man. Because of a misunderstandsting her cousin thinks that Lila is talking about the president of the company, who is a lot older than Lila, and persuades him to express his feelings to her. He goes to the office and asks her to go out but Lila is offended and he is at a loss, so he leaves. A weekend is coming up and Lila is planning to go to Nauplio with her father and her cousin. But some business needs to be done and so she decides to ask Alekos to devote his weekend to that business if he is free. Alekos was planning to go to Nafplio too with his girlfriend but lies instead and says that he doesn't have anything else to do. Just then his girlfriend Vicky (Nitsa Marouda) comes into the office and reveals their plans to go to Nafplio. Lila is crushed even more because all this time Alekos was trying to dissuade her from going to Nafplio. She is disapponted and decides not to assign him the extra work. Some time has gone by. Athina is trying to help her cousin, showing her how to improve her outer appearance, dress better etc. Meanwhile Alekos was in Mesologgi on business. He returns that afternoon and a friend of him comes to visit him. Alekos' mother (Eleni Zafiriou) doesn't like her son's girlfriend and asks Stavros (Kostas Karras) to talk to him about her, but he refuses. A short while after that Vicky arrives all dressed up to pick Alekos up and go out with him. He says he is too tired to go out and she leaves irritated. At the same time Lila and Athina are getting ready to go out. Lila was expecting a call from Alekos but he still hasn't returned her call. They talk about him and Athina reveals to her that Vicky is also seeing another man, a doctor. Lila says that they should tell that to Alekos but Athina says that that would be too petty. In his house Alekos talks to Stavros about her and he is full of admiration for her, leading Stavros to believe that he has a crush on her. Alekos says he is tired of women like Vicky and Stavros reveals to him that his mother is of the same opinion. Lila finally decides to call him again, but when she does he hangs up because he thinks that it's Vicky. Her cousin tells her that he spoke to him far too sweetly, which is not like her and he didn't understand who it was. In the end they talk to each other and they arrange to meet that night, the reason for this being (as Athina explains to her) that Lila is dressed up and Alekos will have a chance to see her when she looks so good. Over the phone he asks her if he could come back to Athens and Lila agrees. While they are waiting for him Vicky comes and asks Lila to bring Alekos back to Athens. Vicky leaves and Lila gets angry because she thinks the two of them are plotting in order to be together. Alekos arrives and they start arguing. Lila decides to send him even further, to Soufli, and Alekos ends up handing in his resignation. Lila storms out of the room and Athina tells him that it is childish to ignore his work in order to be in Athens and go out with his girlfriend. Alekos explains that he wants to attend a seminar. Athina realises their mistake. She asks Alekos to go to his house to cool off and then call Lila again. Everything will be arranged. Athina reveals to Lila the true reason why Alekos wants to stay in Athens and the misunderstanding is resolved. Some time later the president of the company Admiral Gelevourdezos holds one of his legendary parties at his house. Lila doesn't want to go but when she finds out that Alekos will be there too, she can't wait to get there. When Lila and Athina arrive the house is full of people having fun. Most of them work at the Admiral's company. The Admiral welcomes the two cousins, there are no hard feelings between him and Lila because of the previous misunderstanding. He prepares them something to drink and Athina confides in Lila that she wants to marry him because he is very rich. Just then Vicky arrives. Lila is upset because she tought that she had broken up with Alekos. The Admiral asks her to dance and she agrees. When Alekos arrives together with Stavros she runs to him. Alekos brushes her off. She says that the doctor was the one who was attending her grandma, but he doesn't believe her and she finally leaves him alone. Athina wants to go to get something from her car and sees the two men. She tells them that she is there together with her cousin and leaves. Alekos is excited because Stavros will finally have the chance to meet this fantastic woman, that he so much admires. In the meantime Lila is a little tipsy and she is dancing, making a complete fool of herself because she doesn't really know how to dance. Alekos is at a loss for words. When Lila sees him, she comes up to him and starts flirting with him in her own awkward way. Alekos doesn't understand the meaning of all this and is about to leave. On his way out he meets Athina again who reveals to him that Lila is in love with him and that all this time she has been trying to help her cousin become more feminine. Alekos returns to the party determined to finish the masquerade once and for all. He takes Lila to the veranda so they can dance there alone. He comes on to her, she slaps him in the face and goes inside again. The whole scene was witnessed by another guest of the party, who makes some degrading comments. The two of them start fighting. Lila is excited because she thinks they are fighting over her. The police arrive and Alekos ends up spending his night in jail. The Admiral and Athina take Lila home and the Admiral goes on to ask Athina to marry him. Next day Lila feels humiliated by the way she behaved at the party and decides to resign while avoiding Alekos at the same time.

In medieval times, Spain is occupied by the conquering Moors of North Africa. Within this context, a peaceful Christian village's existence is shaken by the arrival of a Moorish army unit led by Sheik Abengalbon and his son Halaf. The unit occupies the local fortress. It sends out smaller groups of soldiers to collect taxes, grain and other tribute from the conquered Spanish villages and towns. Despite the servility shown by the Alcalde (mayor) of the village of this story, the locals and the peasants grumble and aren't so welcoming towards the invading Moors. Nevertheless, the Moors collect the grain of several villages and leave. On their way to the nearby Moorish-occupied fortress, the unit is ambushed by local brigands who kill the guards and steal the grain and other war booty from the dead Moors. Outraged by the news, Sheik Abengalbon and his son Halaf lead a punishing expedition. They take Spanish hostages and they later execute them in Arab fashion by using the 'water well torture'. The locals react by starting to organize a secret Spanish army in order to evict the Moors from Spanish soil. The volunteer Spanish force is comprised of local peasants, tradesmen, some nobles and even women and children. Children contribute to the effort by stealing weapons from the Moorish fortress and by smuggling necessities to the secret camp. Spanish priests bless the army and teach the soldiers war strategy from Julius Caesar's old books. The rebels are led by Spanish nobleman Don Gonzalo Herrera y Menéndez and his son Fernando. Also aiding the rebels is beautiful Sancha Ordonez whose father, the village mayor, was executed by the vengeful Moors. Unfortunately, the Moors have many spies among the locals, some of them Spanish men who offer their services to the Moors for payment. Aware of the existence of a rebel Spanish army being formed and trained at a secret camp, the Moorish commander decides to rally his troops and attack first. The outcome of the battle could decide whether the Spanish inhabitants will become free again or remain under the harsh Moorish rule.—nufs68"
