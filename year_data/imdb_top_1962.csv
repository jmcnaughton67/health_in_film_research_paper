Setting off on a journey to the west in the 1830s, the Prescott family run into a man named Linus who helps them fight off a pack of thieves. Linus then marries daughter Eve Prescott (Carroll Baker), and 30 years later goes off with their son to fight in the Civil War, with bloody results. Eve's sister Lily heads farther west and has adventures with a professional gambler, stretching all the way to 1880s San Francisco.—Jwelch5742 Sprawling epic which follows the Prescotts, an emigrant family through four generations, from the Erie Canal in the 1830's to their settled home in the West a half a century later. On the way they encounter river pirates,and escape with the help of fur trapper Linus Rawlings, who subsequently marries one of their daughters, Eve. The parents are drowned on a foundering raft, and the other daughter Lilith becomes a riverboat singer and catches the eye of a genteel adventurer Cleve Van Valen. They cross the plains together in a wagon train and make and lose a fortune in California; meanwhile Linus has turned farmer and during the Civil War joins the Union Army and is killed at the Battle of Shiloh. One of his sons, Zeb, also joins the army and stays after the war as a cavalry officer and is sent to Colorado to help guard the pioneering railroad against the Indians, whose land they are crossing. By this time Lilith is the elderly lady of the family, having survived long enough to see the dream of settlement realized, but not, mercifully, the aerial shots of the Los Angeles freeway traffic with which the film ends.—alfiehitchie The 50 years of American westward expansion between the 1830s and 1880s are viewed through the experiences of the Prescott and Rawlings families as they migrate by the Erie Canal, continue over the prairies from St. Louis during the California gold rush, suffer through the Civil War, and finally help build the railroads on the plains and bring law and justice to the frontier. Along the way they meet mountain men, journey by wagon train, deal with Native Americans, and face outlaws in the southwest.—scgary66 The story of how, over several generations, families opened up the Western U.S. to settlement. Zebulong Prescott, his wife Rebecca, and their daughters Eve and Lilith make the perilous journey down the newly-built Erie Canal. Along the way they meet hunter and trapper Linus Rawlings, a genuine mountain man and catches Eve's eye. They go their separate ways but Linus helps them again when river bandits try to rob them of their earthly possessions. A subsequent tragedy on the river brings Eve and Linus closer together. Her sister Lilith decides to leave as soon as possible, but ends up meeting her man, Cleve Van Velen, and and they make their way to the West Coast where they make their fortune. Eve and Linus' son Zeb fights in the Civil War and stays in the army afterward. He is assigned to protect the railroad, currently under construction. He sees the fear Indians have of the encroachment of white men onto their lands and the destruction of the buffalo. He makes a name for himself as a lawman and eventually agrees to take over his aunt Lilith's ranch, but not before taking on one last fight.—garykmcd"
Lawrence of Arabia,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story ofT.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks. Due to his knowledge of the native Bedouin tribes, British LieutenantT.E. Lawrenceis sent to Arabia to find Prince Faisal and serve as a liaison between the Arabs and the British in their fight against the Turks. With the aid of native Sherif Ali, Lawrence rebels against the orders of his superior officer and strikes out on a daring camel journey across the harsh desert to attack a well-guarded Turkish port.—Jwelch5742 A semi-fictional account of the exploits of British military officerT.E. Lawrenceduring WWI is presented, plus a prologue at his 1935 funeral where his contemporaries remark or don't remark at how they consider him and his military contributions especially to the Great War. Viewed somewhat as an insolent man, he, a lieutenant in intelligence at a desk job in the Cairo bureau, is assigned to go on a reconnaissance mission to the Arabian peninsula to assess Prince Faisal's efforts against the Turks. He is assigned this job in what is considered its low importance in the British still focusing their own efforts directly on the German offensive, and because of his academic knowledge of Arabia. Against the narrow confines of his original orders and advice of ranking officers in the field, Lawrence, befriending many he meets, not only the Prince but most specifically Sherif Ali, bands with the Arabs in being able to coalesce the many disparate tribes which comprise the fighting Bedouins. Things begin to change for Lawrence when the British military as a whole gets more involved in the goings-on in Arabia - they working on the presumed goals of the politicians - and Lawrence himself changes his own outlook as a human being in being caught directly in battle.—Huggo An inordinately complex man who has been labelled everything from hero, to charlatan, to sadist,T.E. Lawrenceblazed his way to glory in the Arabian desert, then sought anonymity as a common soldier under an assumed name. The story opens with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle accident in Dorset at the age of forty-six, then flashbacks to recount his adventures: as a young intelligence officer in Cairo in 1916, he is given leave to investigate the progress of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I. In the desert, he organizes a guerrilla army and, for two years, leads the Arabs in harassing the Turks with desert raids, train-wrecking, and camel attacks. Eventually, he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the Ottoman Empire.—alfiehitchie In 1935, T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. Gasim (I. S. Johar) succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man. Sherif Ali, won over, burns Lawrence's British uniform and gives him Arab robes to wear.Lawrence persuades Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn), the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's plan is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a blood feud. Since Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. Stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, he shoots him anyway. The next morning, the intact alliance overruns the Turkish garrison.Lawrence heads to Cairo to inform Dryden and the new commander, General Allenby (Jack Hawkins), of his victory. During the crossing of the Sinai Desert, Daud dies when he stumbles into quicksand. Lawrence is promoted to major and given arms and money to support the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the British have designs on Arabia. Pressed, the general states they have no such designs.INTERMISSIONLawrence launches a guerrilla war, blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. American war correspondent Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy) publicises his exploits, making him world famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured, Lawrence is forced to shoot him before fleeing.When Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of Daraa with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish Bey (José Ferrer). Lawrence is stripped, ogled and prodded. For striking out at the Bey, he is severely flogged, then thrown out into the street. Lawrence is so traumatised by the experience that he abandons all of his exploits, going from having proclaimed himself a god, to insisting he is merely a man. He attempts to return to the British forces and swear off the desert, but he never fits in there. In Jerusalem, Allenby urges him to support his ""big push"" on Damascus, but Lawrence is a changed, tormented man, unwilling to return. After Allenby insists that Lawrence has a destiny, he finally relents. Lawrence naively believes that the warriors will come for him rather than for money.He recruits an army, mainly killers, mercenaries, and cutthroats motivated by money, rather than the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just slaughtered the people of the village of Tafas. One of Lawrence's men from the village demands, ""No prisoners!"" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's cry, resulting in a massacre in which Lawrence himself participates with relish. Afterward, he realises the horrible consequences of what he has done.His men then take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but they are desert tribesmen, ill-suited for such a task. The various tribes argue among themselves and in spite of Lawrence's insistence, cannot unite against the English, who in the end take the city back under their bureaucracy. Unable to maintain the utilities and bickering constantly with each other, they soon abandon most of the city to the British. Promoted to colonel and immediately ordered home, his usefulness at an end to both Faisal and the British diplomats, a dejected Lawrence is driven away in a staff car."

While dodging tarantulas, ""fire breathing dragons"", and a trio of assassins, known as ""the three blind mice"". Bond meets up with the beautiful Honey Ryder and goes face to face with the evil Dr. No.—simon_hrdng Everyhing starts when the British Agent John Strangways and his secretary go missing in Jamaica. James Bond is assigned by M to investigate what have happened with the agents. 007 teams-up with C.I.A. Agent Felix Leiter and the native Quarrel that works with him, and 007 learns that Strangways was investigating the Crab Key Island that belongs to the mysterious Dr. No, and is very well protected by armed guards. Soon they learn that Dr. No is toppling the rockets launched by N.A.S.A. at Cape Canaveral, and 007 goes to Crab Key with Quarrel to seek evidence against Dr. No. They meet the sexy Honey Ryder collecting seashells in the island. They stay together, but soon they are found by security guards and arrested in Dr. No's facility, and James Bond learns the evil plan of Dr. No and S.P.E.C.T.R.E.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Licenced to kill, James Bond, an effortlessly suave and lethally efficient Secret Service agent, is dispatched to Jamaica to shed light on the unaccountable disappearance of a fellow MI6 agent investigating strange activity in the area. As Bond catches the eye of every assassin in Kingston, he follows a faint trail of clues leading to sandy Crab Key Island: the off-limits, peril-laden property of sophisticated and mysterious recluse Dr No. But no one has ever set foot on the dangerous islet and lived to tell the tale. When world domination enters the equation, what will it take to unearth the truth?—Nick Riganas James Bond 007, seductive British Secret Agent, has been sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of British Agent John Strangway and his secretary.

Not long after he is killed, a group of assassins invade his office, murder his secretary and steal several files, including those marked ""Crab Key"" and ""Dr. No"". When MI6 in London is unable to hail Strangways offices, they report the situation to their superiors.In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming. M calls in MI6's armorer to issue Bond a new sidearm. Bond's current sidearm, a Beretta model M1934, has been unreliable, despite Bond's attempt to defend his use of it for the last ten years. On his last mission, it jammed and prevented him from defending himself, resulting in a lengthy hospital stay. The new pistol is a Walther PP (but erroneously called a ""PPK"" by the armorer), standard issue with the CIA. Bond still tries to pilfer his old pistol when he leaves but M catches him in the act.Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. He is picked up by a chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent after calling his contact and confirming that they did not send a car to the airport. The driver takes off at a high rate of speed, presumably because he spots another car following them. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and holds the man at gunpoint. After a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette.During his investigation Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be un-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognises Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot find the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals that he has been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also tells about the island of Crab Key, owned by the reclusive Dr. No, who operates a bauxite mine which is rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force and low-scan radar.After finding a receipt in Strangways' house about mysterious rocks naming Professor R.J. Dent, Bond meets with Dent who says he had assayed the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. This visit makes Dent wary and he takes a boat to Crab Key where Dr. No expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond and orders him to try again, this time with a large venomous spider. Bond survives and kills the spider.Bond becomes friendly with Dent's secretary, Miss Taro and agrees to meet her at her home in the hills above Kingston. While driving there, Bond is attacked by several men driving a large hearse. He is able to outmaneuver them and the hearse is run off the mountain road and explodes. When Bond shows up at Taro's house, she's surprised to see him, a fact that Bond notes easily. She goes into her bedroom and talks on the phone to her boss, who tells her to keep Bond occupied for a few hours. Bond and Taro spend that time in bed.Bond makes a phone call, ostensibly asking for a taxi but actually talking to the local police, who show up soon after and arrest Taro. Bond then sets a trap for Dent and waits for him to show. Dent steals into the bedroom and fires several silenced shots into the bed, which Bond rigged to look like it was occupied. Bond forces Dent to drop his pistol and begins to interrogate him about Strangways and his radioactive rock samples, which Dent tried to cover up. Dent is able to recover his pistol. Finding it empty, Bond coldly shoots him dead.Having detected radioactive traces in Quarrel's boat, where Strangways' mineral samples had been, Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. Quarrel's apprehension is guided by a local legend that a fire-breathing dragon roams the forests and beaches of the Key. Bond scoffs at the idea and Quarrel agrees to take him there.On the beach there, Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder, dressed only in a white bikini, who is collecting larch conch shells. At first she is suspicious of Bond but soon decides to help him. When Bond asks her if she had her sail up all the way to the beach, she tells him that No's men have tried to catch her in the past but failed. A high-powered boat soon appears. Bond, realizing that Ryder's boat was detected by radar, has the three of them hide near the forest behind the beach. They are shot at, though the men on the boat cannot see them. Ryder leads them all inland to an open swamp,. Though No's men track them with dogs, they are able to hide in a stream using reeds to breathe. When one of the men lingers behind, Bond kills him, much to Ryder's horror. As they continue upstream, they fail to notice a barbed wire fence and a large sign marking a danger zone.While taking a rest, Ryder tells Bond a little about her past: her father was a marine zoologist who went to Crab Key but never returned, presumably caught and murdered by No. The man who owned their house in Kingston had raped her and she took revenge on him, placing a black widow in his bed, leaving him to die slowly and painfully.After nightfall they encounter the legendary ""dragon"" of Crab Key which turns out to be a flame-throwing armoured vehicle. In the resulting gun battle, Quarrel is incinerated by the flame-thrower whilst Bond and Honey are taken prisoner. Bond and Honey are decontaminated after radiation exposure and taken to quarters before being drugged with laced coffee. Later, while Bond is unconscious, someone with strange hands enters his room and watches him while he sleeps.Upon waking they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a half-Chinese man with mechanical hands that replaced his own after a radiation experiment went awry. He reveals that he is a member of SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion) and plans to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam. After dinner Honey is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.Bond is imprisoned in a holding cell but finds a way to escape through a vent. Disguised as a worker, Bond finds his way to the control centre, a multi-level room full of high-tech instrumentation with an atomic reactor set into the floor, overseen by Dr. No from a command console. Bond overloads the nuclear reactor just as the American rocket is about to take off. Hand-to-hand combat ensues between Bond and Dr. No, with the scientist being pushed into the reactor's cooling vat, in which he boils to death, his steel hands making it impossible for him to get a grip to climb out. Bond then finds Honey in a room, bound to the floor with water slowly rising toward her head. The two escape in a boat just as the entire lair explodes. Their boat later runs out of fuel and they drift for a while before being found by Leiter and the Coast Guard. They throw Bond a rope and begin to tow him and Ryder back to shore, but Bond deliberately drops the rope, leaving them drifting again on the tide."
The Music Man,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056262/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Traveling con artist Harold Hill targets the naïve residents of a small town in 1910s Iowa by posing as a boys' band leader to raise money before he can skip town. It's the early 20th-century American Midwest. A con man going by the assumed name Harold Hill has used several different schemes to bilk the unsuspecting, and now travels from town to town pretending to be a professor of music - from the Gary (Indiana) Conservatory of Music, class of '05 - who solves all the respective towns' youth problems by forming boys' marching bands. He takes money from the townsfolk to buy instruments, music, instructional materials, and uniforms for their sons. However, in reality, he has no degree and knows nothing about music, and after all the materials arrive and are distributed, he absconds with all the money, never to be seen again. Many of the traveling salesmen in the territory have been negatively impacted by him, as the townsfolk then become suspicious of any stranger trying to sell them something. For Harold's scheme to work, he must gain the trust of the local music teacher, usually by wooing her, regardless of her appearance. And if the town doesn't believe it has a youth problem needing to be fixed, he will manufacture one for them. That is the case when he arrives in River City, Iowa, population 2,212, where he will have some unexpected help from Marcellus Washburn, a friend and former grifter colleague who now lives in River City and has gone straight, but he still wants to make sure Harold survives his stay in town. River City's music teacher is spinster and town librarian Marian Paroo. He's able to impress all the other River Citizens with his fast-talking sales pitches, but not suspicious Marian, whose hard-as-nails exterior is unlike all the other River Citizens. Her exterior is partly due to her somewhat removed standing in the town, as all the gossipy housewives believe she is a smut peddler - encouraging the teenagers to read authors such as Chaucer and Balzac - and mistakenly believe that she got her position as librarian through less-than-scrupulous means. What Harold does not know is that one way to Marian is through her young adolescent brother, Winthrop Paroo, a sullen boy who has withdrawn from life since their father's death two years before, when he started to lisp. Harold starts to fall for Marian, something that never happened with any of the other music teachers. Further complications may ensue if any of those traveling salesmen who have been following his route through the territory catch up with and expose him.—Huggo When traveling con man Harold Hill arrives in River City, he convinces the locals to start a band by purchasing uniforms and instruments from him. He intends to flee as soon as he receives the money. Librarian Marian Paroo suspects that he's a fraud, but since her moody brother Winthrop is excited about the band, she keeps silent. As Harold develops feelings for Marian, he faces a difficult decision about skipping town.—Jwelch5742 Confidence man Harold Hill arrives at staid River City intending to cheat the community with his standard scam of offering to equip and train a boys' marching band, then skip town with the money since he has neither music knowledge nor skill. Things go awry when he falls for a librarian he tries to divert from exposing him, while he inadvertently enriches the town with a love of music.—Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> Professor Harold Hill likes a challenge, and when the other salesmen on the train west tell him that Iowa is the biggest test of all of sales ability, he gets off at River City. We know it's the 20th century there, only because of a reference in one of the songs to Gary, Indiana.

They are particularly scornful of a certain ""Professor"" Harold Hill (Robert Preston), who goes into a town, sells the kids musical instruments, instruction books, and band uniforms, under the promise that he will form a band for them, and then disappears. Someone mentions that ""He don't know one note from another!"". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that ""Professor Hill""'s current racket is boys' bands. Marcellus says that it will be difficult to make headway on that front, because the town librarian and piano teacher, Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones), is quite smart and will expose him instantly. Harold takes that as a challenge, both professionally and romantically. Harold also mentions that he'll be in town longer than his usual stretch, a week, because not only will he con the town into buying the instruments, but also uniforms, which will take several weeks to arrive. Marcellus still sees the scheme as a very risky one.The mayor's wife, Eulalie Mackechnie Shinn (Hermione Gingold), shows up at the Madison library; she is extremely prudish, ignorant, and outspoken. She complains that the book that Marian recommended for her daughter Zaneeta, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, is smutty: ""People lying out in the woods, eating sandwiches, and drinking out of jugs."" (This is a reference to the famous line ""A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou."")Harold needs some interesting current event or fad to hang his pitch on, and Marcellus says that a new pool table is being installed in the local billiard parlor. Harold goes into action. He starts buttonholing local merchants, telling them that this pool table will have a corrupting influence on the youth of the town, and that they need to keep the kids moral. Many townspeople gather around, and he sings the song ""Ya got trouble / right here in River City / with a capital T and that rhymes with P / and that stands for pool.""Marian stops by to look at the crowd, and Marcellus points her out to Harold with a prearranged signal. Then, as she goes home, he attempts to flirt with her with some trite pickup lines. She is very cold to him. When she arrives home, a little girl from the town, Amaryllis (Monique Vermont), is there for her piano lesson. Marian tells her mother that a man had attempted to follow her. Mrs. Paroo (Pert Kelton) is excited, as she wants Marian to get married and settle down, but Marian is not impressed with the intellectual caliber of the men she meets. The two of them sing an argument, accompanied by Amaryllis playing a piano exercise, about whether Marian's expectations are unrealistic.While Amaryllis is getting a drink from the outdoor water pump, Marian's much younger brother Winthrop (Ron Howard) comes by. Amaryllis invites him to a party she will be giving. Winthrop says no. His mother insists that he say it politely, with her name. He says ""No thank you, Amaryllis."" But he has a serious lisp, and botches the ""s"" in her name. Amaryllis giggles at first, but when Winthrop runs inside crying, she is mortified. She tells Marian that she likes Winthrop very much, and says goodnight to him every night on the evening star, but he hardly ever says a word to her. Marian tells her that the lisp is just part of Winthrop's problem, that he hardly ever says anything even to his own family, and that everyone needs to be very patient and understanding with him. She explains that, if Winthrop isn't the right person to say goodnight to on the evening star, she can say goodnight to an unnamed ""someone"". They sing the song ""Goodnight My Someone"".The town's annual Fourth of July celebration is held in the high school, presided over by Mayor Shinn (Paul Ford) and his wife. Mayor Shinn is pompous, foolish, and verbally inept. A silly patriotic tableau is presented. Tommy Djilas (Timmy Everett), a teenage boy, sets off a firecracker, right behind the Mayor's wife, causing a ruckus. Amidst all the silly goings on, Harold Hill gets up and complains about the pool table. He is joined by others, and egged on by Marcellus. He gets into his band director's uniform, takes the stage, and makes an impassioned plea for the creation of a boys' band, to keep the youth of the town wholesomely occupied. This turns into the musical song and dance number ""Seventy six trombones led the big parade / with a hundred and ten cornets close at hand / they were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos / the cream of every famous band.""Marian is completely unimpressed by the spectacle. She tells Mayor Shinn that he and the four members of the school board are being hoodwinked. In response, Mayor Shinn directs the school board to get Harold's credentials.Tommy Djilas gets apprehended by the constable. Mayor Shinn berates Tommy for endangering his wife with the firecracker, and for hanging around with his oldest daughter Zaneeta. Harold says that he will take responsibility for Tommy, and takes him under his wing. Since Tommy is older than the intended age range for the band, Harold suggests a leadership role instead, and charges him with fashioning a device that will hold music for a marching piccolo player. Tommy runs off to find a piece of wire.At the Fourth of July celebration that evening, Harold is met by the School board, who ask him for references. Showing his con artist skill to the utmost, he points out the amazing discovery that they have extraordinary singing talent. Before long, Harold has them (the school board are played by the famed barbershop quartetThe Buffalo Bills) singing barbershop songs in perfect harmony. Harold then tries to strike up a friendship with Marian, who is again extremely cold to him. He tells her that he is a graduate of ""Gary Indiana Conservatory, gold medal class of '05."" Marian remains utterly unimpressed.Harold begins the process of persuading the River City parents to part with their money, for musical instruments and band uniforms, by telling outlandishly exaggerated stories of their children's natural talent. He is quite a con artist.Harold runs into the fashionable ladies of River City in the livery stable, and, in contrast to Marian, they are ""all agog"" over his talent. He tells them he wants to form a lady's classic dance auxiliary. He flatters Mrs. Shin, in the most preposterous way, over her alleged physical grace. The ladies are enthused over the formation of this group. Then he mentions Marian, hoping that they can help win her over by putting her in the dance group. They are instantly hostile about her. They say that, as librarian, she advocates dirty books--titles by authors such as Chaucer, Rabelais, and Balzac. Furthermore, she made ""brazen overtures"" to ""Old Miser Madison"", the man who had donated huge amounts of money to the town, building many of the town's facilities. He left the Madison Library to the town, but left the books to Marian personally. They also paint her as a spinster of sorts, having seen her frequenting his house many times. They sing the song ""Pick a Little, Talk a Little"" about this. Then the school board people show up, demanding Harold's credentials. He distracts them by singing the line ""Good Night, Ladies"" at the ladies, and the school board breaks into a barbershop rendition of that song, while Harold slips away. The two songs, by the ladies and by the school board, are then sung as an ""ensemble song"", simultaneously and in harmony with each other.That evening, Harold tells Marcellus that his interests in women are not toward the pure and wholesome type, but the worldly and more experienced type, which he now perceives Marian to be. He sings the the song ""The Sadder but Wiser Girl.""The next day he goes to the library and attempts once again to strike up a relationship with Marian. He tells her that he knows about Mr. Madison, and that he forgives her indiscretion in the matter. Marian is incredulous, and once again totally rejects his advances. He sings the song ""Marian the Librarian"" causing organized chaos in the otherwise silent and peaceful library.Harold continues to work the townspeople, at one point almost persuading Mayor Shinn himself to sign up his son for the band, before he realizes that he has no son. He gets to the Paroo home, and persuades Mrs. Paroo that her son Winthrop will be a natural cornet player. Winthrop shows up, and Harold tells him about the band, and the cornet, and the uniform. Winthrop asks ""Will it have a ...."" and draws a line down his outer pant leg; he doesn't want to say the word ""stripe"" because of the ""s"". Harold assures him that it will have a stripe; Winthrop then runs off. Mrs. Paroo explains that Winthrop hardly ever talks. Harold tells Mrs. Paroo about his alma mater--""Gary Conservatory, gold medal class of '05."" He sings the song ""Gary, Indiana.""Marian shows up; Harold hadn't realized until then that she was part of that family. Marian tells Harold that they are not interested in the band. Harold suggests that the boy's father should be asked. Marian tells Harold that he should not meddle in the family's affairs, and that their father died two years previous. She says that this event was so devastating to Winthrop that he has become the withdrawn and unhappy child that he is.After Harold leaves, Mrs. Paroo urges Marian, once again, to settle down and get married, and says that Harold might be her last chance. Marian sings ""Being in Love"", about what she's looking for in a man.At the library, Marian comes upon the Indiana State Educational Journal, and looks in it, finding information that contradicts Harold's claims about the Gary Conservatory.The Wells Fargo wagon comes to town, an event that is always met with great anticipation because of the interesting things that it brings from far-off places. Just before it arrives, Marian tells Mayor Shinn that she has found incriminating information in a book. But Mayor Shinn puts her off for a moment, since this delivery will be very special: the band instruments. The townspeople sing ""The Wells Fargo Wagon."" When the wagon stops, Harold distributes the instruments, including Winthrop's cornet. Winthrop is utterly beside himself with enthusiasm. He goes to Marian and speaks very excitedly and exuberantly: ""SisterSisterIsn'tThisTheMostScrumptiousSolidGoldThingYouEverSaw? INeverThoughtIdEverSeeAnythingSoScrumptiousAsThisSolidGoldThing. OhSister!"" Marian realizes that, con man though he is, Harold is also a miracle worker in the change she has seen in Winthrop. She has a change of heart about Harold, and secretly tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before handing it over to Mayor Shinn.Harold distributes the other instruments, and tells the kids to stay off the streets and to think about Beethoven's Minuet in G. (He has what he calls the ""think system"" of music. Instead of dealing with reading music and memorizing notes, one just needs to think about a melody, and it will come out.)At the high school, the women's dance committee meets, under the leadership of Mrs. Shinn, and engages in some ridiculously foolish dance practice. Elsewhere in the school, Harold is exhorting the students: ""If you want to play the Minuet in G, think the Minuet in G."" The boys ask reasonable questions about such elementary things as how to hold their instruments, and Harold deflects the questions with his usual subterfuges. He then has them just sing the Minuet in G. He tells Tommy Djilas to take over the rehearsal, having them sing for another hour or so.At the ice cream parlor, Harold treats Tommy and Zaneeta Shinn (Susan Luckey) to sundaes--he has been encouraging their romance, even though Mayor Shinn doesn't want his daughter hanging around with Tommy. The Mayor bursts in, and upbraids Tommy. Tommy stands up to him, as does Zaneeta. He throws Tommy out of the place, and takes Zaneeta home. Marian is there too, and protests the Mayor's actions, to no avail. Mayor Shinn also complains to Marian that he was unable to find any incriminating evidence in the book.Marian and Harold discuss his educational methods, and says that Winthrop never actually plays his cornet. Harold tells her about his ""think system"". They are very friendly and cordial.On his way home, Harold is met by the school board. They demand his credentials immediately. He distracts them once again by discussing famed female bassoonist Lida Rose Quackenbush. They sing the barbershop song ""Lida Rose"" while Harold escapes yet again. Meanwhile, Marian, on her front porch, sings the song ""Sweet and Low"". Then the two groups, even though they are separated, turn these into another ensemble song, singing them together.Winthrop comes by while Marian and Mrs. Paroo are on the front porch, and shows them a pocket knife that Harold gave him, describing in detail and with great enthusiasm all its many blades and features. He says that he and Harold spend a lot of time together. Marian asks what they talk about. ""Sometimes we talk business, and sometimes we just talk."" Harold taught Winthrop a song ""with hardly any ""s""'s in it"", which he sings--the ""Gary, Indiana"" song.There will be a big public ""sociable"" at Madison Park that evening. But first, Charlie Cowell (Harry Hickox), an anvil salesman, shows up at the Paroo residence. (He had been one of the salesmen speaking about Hill's nefarious dealings in the train scene at the very start of the movie.) He has extensive written documentation of Harold Hill's fraudulent methods, and he wants to give it to Mayor Shinn. When he sees the sign in Marian's window about giving piano instruction, he discusses it with her; he assumes that she saw right though Harold from day one. Instead, she defends Hill, and says that Charlie is making a big mistake. Charlie is under a tight time constraint because his train is just making a short stop. Marian uses her feminine wiles to delay him so he won't have time to get to Mayor Shinn. She succeeds at making him miss the train. He angrily walks off, after telling her that Harold Hill has a girl in every county of Illinois, and cozies up to all the piano teachers also.Harold comes by, and he and Marian talk. She is upset by what Charlie Cowell said, and confronts him about his many alleged romantic relationships. ""One hears rumors about traveling salesmen."" He says ""One hears rumors about librarians."" She assumes that's a reference to the rumors, by the fashionable ladies of the town, about Mr. Madison. She tells him indignantly that he was ""Uncle Maddy"", her late father's best friend, and that he gave the library's books, and the librarian job, to her personally so that the family would be provided for after her father's death.Harold suggests that she meet him at the footbridge at Madison Park. She is reluctant at first, because meeting at the footbridge has serious romantic connotations in River City folklore, and she's never been to the footbridge with a man before. But he persuades her.The festivities at the party begin with a huge dance number, with Marcellus singing ""Shipoopi"". Harold and Marian are then going to go to the footbridge.While Harold is going to the footbridge, the next organized entertainment occurs: an extremely silly interpretation of Grecian Urns by the ladies dance auxiliary, under the leadership of Mrs. Shin. While this is happening, the constable summons Mayor Shin to go off and speak to Charlie Cowell, who has finally managed to contact someone in authority.Harold and Marian meet at the footbridge. They are finally in love. She says that she knows he will have to move on to other towns, but that she is grateful for what he has brought to the town. They sing ""Till There Was You"". She tells Harold that she knew he was a fraud practically from the start; the Educational Journal said that there couldn't have been a Gary Conservatory gold medal class of '05, because the town hadn't been founded until '06. She gives him the incriminating page that she had torn out of the book. Though he is in love with Marian, Harold knows that he will either have to skip town or be arrested.Back at the party, Mayor Shinn interrupts a barbershop song by introducing Charlie Cowell, who tells the crowd that Hill is a swindler, and that he has a large amount of written proof of it. The townspeople are aghast. Winthrop runs off, crying. The townspeople run in all directions searching all over town for Harold.Not knowing anything about this, Harold and Marian arrive at her house. She goes inside to put on a shawl. Harold stays outside, singing ""Seventy Six Trombones"". Inside, Marian sings ""Goodnight my Someone"". They turn it into another ensemble song.While the massive search goes on, with Marcellus attempting to mislead them, Mrs. Paroo arrives home, and warns Harold and Marian that people are talking about tar and feathers. Harold doesn't know what to say. Marian tells him that he doesn't owe her anything, and he needs to leave.Winthrop arrives home, very upset, and Harold stops him. Harold realizes that he has been harming people whom he cares about, and he needs to drop his con-man persona and be honest with people. He tells Winthrop that he will level with him. Winthrop asks ""Can you lead a band?"" ""No."" ""Are you a big liar?"" ""Yes."" ""Are you a dirty rotten crook?"" ""Yes."" Harold then tells him ""There are two things you're entitled to know. One, you're a wonderful kid. I thought so from the first. That's why I wanted you in the band, so you'd stop moping around and feeling sorry for yourself."" ""What band?"" Harold sadly admits ""I always think there's a band."" ""And what's the other thing I'm entitled to know?"" ""The other thing's none of your business, come to think of it."" He glances up at Marian as he says that; clearly the other thing is that he wants to become Winthrop's brother-in-law. Winthrop says that he wishes Harold had never come to River City. Marian steps in at this point, saying that everything Harold promised actually came true, in the good way everyone in the town behaved all summer, especially Winthrop. Winthrop tells Harold he needs to leave, but he can't tear himself away from Marian. The constable catches up with him and leads him away in handcuffs. The Paroo family are all devastated.People have gathered at the high school. Mayor Shin addresses the angry crowd. When he hears that Harold Hill has been caught, he announces, in his usual artless way, ""The sword of restibution [sic] has cut down Professor Harold Hill."" Hill is brought in. Mayor Shinn suggests that he will be tarred and feathered.Marian gets up and makes an impassioned plea: ""I should think some of you could forget your everlasting Iowa stubbornness long enough to remember what this town was like before Harold Hill came. Do you? Well, do you? And after he came. Suddenly there were things to do, and things to be proud of, and people to go out of your way for. Surely some of you can be grateful for what this man has brought to us. And I should think you'd want to admit it."" Mayor Shinn stops her. He says that anyone who doesn't want Harold Hill tarred and feathered should stand up.After a long pause, people slowly start standing up. Mrs. Paroo, Zaneeta, the school board, the dance committee, even Mrs Shinn, who stands up defiantly again when her husband orders her to sit down. Mayor Shinn reminds them that they were promised a band. ""Where's the band? Where's the band?"" Then Tommy Djilas, out in the corridor, blows a director's whistle, the doors open, and the children file into the room, in uniform, with their instruments. They line up in concert formation at the front of the room. Marian gives Harold a podium and a makeshift baton. Harold gets up in front of the kids, but is frightened. Marian gives him a reassuring look. He mutters desperately ""Think, men, think!"" and starts to conduct. The kids play the Minuet in G, very badly, but recognizably. That's good enough for the parents. They are delighted. ""That's my Barney."" ""That's Eddie.""The final scene is a fantasy in which the children's band is replaced by a large number of real musicians who parade down the street playing ""Seventy Six Trombones""."

The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056700/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, and three of their stories. The fictionalized lives of the story-telling Grimm brothers are brought to life in this all-star fantasy film. In the early nineteenth century, the brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm are commissioned to write a family history for a local Duke. Reenactments of three of their stories including ""The Dancing Princess"", ""The Cobbler and the Elves"" and ""The Singing Bone"".—alfiehitchie A fictionalized account of brothersJacob GrimmandWilhelm Grimmleading to the publishing of the stories for which they are now most famous is presented, that account incorporating the whimsy and fantasy of the stories themselves. It's the early nineteenth century Prussia, and the brothers have been hired by the Duke to write a comprehensive account of his family's history, only touching on those aspects of glory in wanting to impress King Wilhelm III. The Duke, in return, has provided them with housing rent-free as an advance, they only receiving payment upon the completion of the manuscript due in six months following the beginning of the commission. Jacob, in his narrow technical mindset, just wants to complete the job, he, in that mindset, unable to see that Greta Heinrich is interested in him as more than a writer in she having bought one of his technical books on German grammar. Chronically ill Wilhelm, married with two adolescent children, however, is easily distracted from this job as he is more interested in collecting fairy tales, which their telling he believes brings joy to life - especially important in war raging nearby - and which he fears will be lost forever if they are not documented. In the process of collecting those fairy tales, three of them come to life. Wilhelm has to balance his commitments, not only to the vainglorious Duke but also to Jacob and his family, against these dreams of having the fairy tales published, which entails convincing those that matter, including such people as Stossel the bookseller, that there is a market demand for such stories. Arguably, he may have to convince himself the most.—Huggo Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm are writing a historical manuscript for a local duke, but the project is late because Wilhelm spends his time gathering fairy tales. When Wilhelm drops part of the manuscript in a creek, catches pneumonia while retrieving it. Near death, he dreams of various characters that want to be written -- and upon his recovery, a shaken Jacob agrees to work on a book of fairy tales with him, beginning the brothers' illustrious career."
Hatari!,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056059/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of men trap wild animals in Africa and sell them to zoos before the arrival of a female wildlife photographer threatens to change their ways. Sean Mercer (played by John Wayne) runs a business in East Africa. He and his team capture wild animals for zoos. It is dangerous work - one of his men almost dies after being gored by a rhino. He accepts a request from a photographer to join his business and capture their experiences but is very surprised, and bit inconvenienced, when the photographer turns out to be a woman. However, over time he grows fond of her. Meanwhile, plans to capture certain animals lead to all sorts of plans and adventures.—grantss John Wayne and his ensemble cast cavort over the African landscape filling orders from zoos for wild animals. Bruce Cabot plays ""the Indian"", a womanizing sharpshooter who is gored by a rhino in the opening scenes of the film. This becomes a running theme through the movie; their bad luck in catching rhinos, and provides the climactic ending chase. While Bruce is in the hospital, Elsa Martinelli shows up as a woman photographer from a Swiss zoo, and John wants to send her packing. She strongarms the Duke into letting her stay by promising that her zoo will buy most of their animals this season if she's allowed to go along on the hunts and take photos. Hardy Kruger, Gerard Blain, Michelle Girardon and Valentin de Vargas round out the group. They traipse over the African landscape capturing animals; Elsa also has a running gag where she collects baby elephants as the movie goes along. In the end she's acquired three of them.—Marta Dawes <smdawes@home.com> In Tanganyika in the 1950s, the Momella Game Company captures animals for zoos and circuses using off-road vehicles, lassos, and cages. The company consists of Frenchwoman Brandy De La Court (Michèle Girardon), the unofficial ""boss"" (her father also died while trying to capture wild animals out in the open); tough Irish-American Sean Mercer (John Wayne), who heads the catching expeditions; retired German race car driver Kurt Müller (Hardy Krüger); Mexican Bullfighter Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez (Valentin De Vargas); Native American sharpshooter Little Wolf (aka ""The Indian"") (Bruce Cabot); former NYC cab driver ""Pockets"" (Red Buttons), who has zoo-phobia; and several native staff.While pursuing an aggressive rhinoceros, Kurt and The Indian ride in a small herding car, which they use to force the animal toward a larger catching truck. The rhino gores The Indian in the leg, and the crew makes the five hour journey to Arusha hospital. French marksman Charles ""Chips"" Maurey (Gérard Blain) arrives, eager to take the Indian's place in the crew, but Kurt, offended (as Kurt blames his own driving for the injury to the Indian), punches him. Chips later turns out to be the only one present with the blood type required to save the Indian's life; he agrees to undergo a transfusion, and Sean offers him a job (after Chris makes Kurt ask him nicely).Back at their compound, the crew finds Italian photographer Anna-Maria ""Dallas"" D'Alessandro (Elsa Martinelli), who has been corresponding with the Indian. They are surprised to learn that ""A.M. D'Alessandro"" is a woman, but she shows them a letter saying she has been sent by the Basel zoo, which is Momella's biggest client, so Sean reluctantly lets her accompany the crew as they capture a giraffe. Despite many rookie embarrassments (She insists to stand up in the truck bed, when Sean warned her off rough ground. Dallas spends most of the hunt on her back), Dallas enjoys her first day. She later offers to leave if she is not wanted, but all but Sean vote to have her stay.
Pockets has fun with Dallas after he sends their pet leopard into the bathroom where Dallas is taking a bath and then pretends to ""rescue"" her. But he is caught out when Sean and Kurt intervene and take the pet leopard away.
Later Pockets reveals that he is actually very scared of animals. He used to drive a cab in New York and just pretends that he is in rush hour, to be able to do his job. Pockets also explains that Sean almost got married once and the girl broke his heart by running away just before the wedding. He says Sean is afraid of loving a girl again, so if he is mean to Dallas, that means he likes her.Chips arrives at the compound; after a rifle-shooting contest (Chips matches Kurt shot for shot), he and Kurt become friends. The gang visits a local watering hole (a real African hole in the ground from which the Masai tribe extracts its water).. They go on a zebra hunt, a black-buck hunt together.
As time goes on, Dallas and Sean begin to develop feelings for one another, though Sean, having previously been jilted by his fiance, resists.
Brandy is pursued by three suitors-Kurt (he shares kisses with Brandy, who considers him Uncle Kurt), Chips (who bathes animals with her), and Pockets. The Indian, still shaken by his experience, is released from the hospital, and Sean agrees to not pursue any more rhinos until the end of the season.On a multi-day trip, the crew passes through a village where a rogue female elephant has been killed by a game warden. They find her orphaned calf, and Dallas adopts it despite Sean's protests. Sean says the calf hasn't been weaned yet and is going to die out of hunger in 2-3 days anyways, but Dallas is adamant. Chaos ensues when the rest of the crew helps Dallas gather goats to get milk for the calf (The goats run away when the calf nears them), though they eventually succeed. Dallas feeds the calf with her own hands, as that's the only way to get some food into it.
That night, Dallas apologizes to Sean, and finally seduces him into giving her a kiss, though Pockets inadvertently interrupts and ruins the moment.
Over the next few days, the gang captures a leopard and a buffalo. Chips saves Kurt from a crocodile. Kurt is thankful to Chips, but they still both pursue Brandy equally. There are some funny moments when Kurt has to get the ostriches back into their pen. Sean does a minor surgery on a fawn.Later, Dallas finds another orphaned elephant calf. The local Waarusha tribe, impressed by how the elephants follow Dallas, arrange a ceremony for her, adopting her into the tribe and naming her ""Mama Tembo"" (""Mother of Elephants""). Dallas' new title is confirmed when a third elephant calf makes its way to the compound. Dallas teaches Pockets how to dance and helps him get close to Brandy.
The crew capture a zebra, an Oryx, a gazelle, a leopard, and a buffalo without incident, but, while pursuing wildebeests, the herding car blows a tire. In the ensuing accident, Kurt's shoulder is dislocated and Chips' leg is badly sprained. The same day, Pockets falls off of a tall fence. He only bruises himself, but Brandy shows the most concern for him out of the three, indicating which suitor she has chosen.Pockets devises a way to catch a huge Vervet monkey troop all at once by using a rocket to cover a whole tree with a fishing net. To the surprise of everyone, including himself, he succeeds, which makes a rhino the only animal left to catch. The crew finds an angry bull rhino, and, although it manages to get loose once, they finally capture it without anyone getting hurt, much to The Indian's relief.
The season's work done, Dallas begins to fear Sean will always see her as he saw his treacherous fiance, so she writes a goodbye letter and flees. Sean, with the help of the rest of the crew and the three baby elephants, tracks her to Arusha, and they reconcile. Sean and Dallas are married, and prepare to spend their wedding night in Sean's room; however, the three elephants barge in and destroy the bed."

However, he encounters typical horrible weather and is unable to make the transit. He then reverses course (to the east) and goes to Tahiti via the originally intended route. This diversion costs more time and pretty much guarantees he will be late in arriving in Tahiti which will require staying there until the plants are transportable (perhaps 6 months).During all this time, Bligh is abusing his men and officers in various ignoble and demeaning ways. He explains his foul behavior to his exec (Mr. Christian) that fear is the only thing seamen understand and this justifies general cruelty and abuse. The sadistic details are numerous and do not advance the plot except to set the stage for the eventual mutiny. After an idyllic stay in Tahiti (the exec, Mr. Christian, is ordered by Bligh to 'sleep with' the Tahitian chief's daughter to avoid insulting the chief) the ship laden with a thousand plants sets sail for Jamaica. More abuse and cruelty ensues on this leg of the trip - mostly as a result of Bligh restricting water to the crew in order to feed the plants (many would otherwise die, says the onboard gardner).Finally Mr. Christian snaps and takes command of the ship and sets Bligh and a few seamen adrift midocean in a boat with enough provisions to last a while (they do make it back to England where Bligh is acquitted of wrongdoing in a naval trial but is scolded). Christian, now in command of returns to Tahiti, picks up a few of the native guys and gals and wanders the ocean looking for a good hiding place and discovers Pitcairn Island which is uninhabited and in the middle of nowhere and mislocated on the naval charts (Google it).The ship is intentionally destroyed by fire at Pitcairn by three of the crew to prevent Christian from making good on an expressed idea to return to England and vindicate the mutiny. Christian is severely burned in the fire when he rushes on board the ship to try to put the fire out. He dies of his burns while saying goodbye to everyone in his death scene."

Humbert Humbert forces a confrontation with a man, whose name he has just recently learned, in this man's home. The events that led to this standoff began four years earlier. Middle aged Humbert, a European, arrives in the United States where he has secured at job at Beardsley College in Beardsley, Ohio as a Professor of French Literature. Before he begins his post in the fall, he decides to spend the summer in the resort town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire. He is given the name of Charlotte Haze as someone who is renting a room in her home for the summer. He finds that Charlotte, widowed now for seven years, is a woman who puts on airs. Among the demonstration of those airs is throwing around the name of Clare Quilty, a television and stage script writer, who came to speak at her women's club meeting and who she implies is now a friend. Those airs also mask being lonely, especially as she is a sexually aggressive and liberated woman. Humbert considers Charlotte a proverbial ""joke"" but decides to rent the room upon meeting Charlotte's provocative daughter, Dolores Haze - more frequently referred to as Lolita - who he first spots in a bikini tanning in the back yard. He is immediately infatuated with Lolita, with who he becomes obsessed in a sexual manner despite her age, she being just into her teens. He will also learn that Charlotte has the exact same feelings for him. While Charlotte does whatever she can to be alone with Humbert, Humbert does the same with Lolita. As the summer progresses, Humbert, based on the circumstances, decides to enter into a relationship with Charlotte just to be near Lolita. In that new arrangement, Humbert has to figure out how to achieve his goal of being with Lolita with Charlotte out of the way. As things begin to go Humbert's way, he is unaware that Charlotte is not the only thing standing in his way between him and Lolita, that other thing being Lolita's possible interest in other boys, and other members of the male sex, young or old, who may have their own designs on Lolita.—Huggo Having secured a lectureship at Beardsley College, Ohio, Humbert, a grizzled British professor of French literature, rents a room in the house of Charlotte Haze, a lonely widow. But instead of spending a peaceful summer in the resort town of Ramsdale, New Hampshire, the sophisticated academic becomes spellbound by Dolores: Charlotte's adorable, gum-chewing 14-year-old daughter. Now, there's no turning back. More and more, impure thoughts grow into forbidden, all-consuming desire--Humbert is but a slave to passion, a wolf in sheep's clothing on a lustful mission of sweet deception and veiled seduction. However, not even Humbert can keep the strange affair away from prying eyes. Is Humbert willing to listen to reason and end the dangerous budding romance before he loses control?—Nick Riganas Humbert Humbert, a divorced British professor of French literature, travels to small-town America for a teaching position. He allows himself to be swept into a relationship with Charlotte Haze, his widowed and sexually famished landlady, whom he marries in order that he might pursue the woman's 14-year-old flirtatious daughter, Lolita, with whom he has fallen hopelessly in love, but whose affections shall be thwarted by a devious trickster named Clare Quilty.—filmfactsman The film begins in a quarrell between two men at a remote mansion. Humbert Humbert (James Mason) a 40-something British professor of French literature, arrives at the masion which is ramsacked from an apparently wild party the night before and finds the insane and debauched Clare Quilty (Peter Sellers), whom is not only suffering from some kind of severe dementia, but is also clearly drunk, as he babbles on incoherently and does not seem to remember Humbert from a time ago. Quilty goes mad when Humbert points a gun at him. After a mutually exhausting struggle for it, Quilty, now insane with fear, merely responds politely as Humbert repeatedly shoots him. He finally dies with a comical lack of interest, expressing his slight concern in an affected English accent. Humbert is left exhausted and disoriented.The film then turns to events four years earlier and goes forward as Humbert travels to Ramsdale, New Hampshire, a small town where he will spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches across the town for room to let, being tempted by widowed, sexually famished mother, Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her beautiful 14-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze (Sue Lyon), affectionately called Lolita (hence the title). Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-chewing, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert falls hopelessly in love.In order to become close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. Soon, however, Charlotte announces that she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleep-away camp for the summer. On the morning of departure, Humbert receives a love confession note from Charlotte, asking Humbert to leave at once. The note says that if Humbert is still in the house when Charlotte returns from driving Lolita to camp, then he must join Charlotte in marriage. Humbert willingly marries Charlotte days later. After the wedding and honeymoon, Charlotte discovers Humberts diary entries describing his passion for Lolita, and has an emotional outburst. She threatens to leave forever, taking Lolita far away from Humbert. While Humbert hurriedly fixes martinis in the kitchen to smooth over the situation, Charlotte runs outside, gets hit by a speeding car, and dies.Humbert drives to Camp Climax to pick up Lolita, who doesn't yet know her mother is dead. That night at a hotel, a pushy, abrasive stranger (Quilty) insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his ""beautiful little daughter,"" who is asleep upstairs. Humbert escapes the man's advances, and Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert.In the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College in Ohio, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates.One night Humbert returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zemph, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be a psychologist from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of ""the facts of life."" Humbert is frightened and decides to take Lolita on the road again.During the long drive across country, Humbert soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When they get a flat tire, Humbert sees the black car stoping beside the road not far from them. Lolita does not seem to be concerned about Humbert's suspicions that the man in the black car is following them, but when he offers to get out to talk to the driver, Lolita suddenly becomes nervous and tells Humbert not to engage the unseen driver in any conversation. Before he can make a decision at what to do, the black car turns around and drives away.When Lolita becomes sick, Humbert takes her to a hospital in a small Arizona town. However that night, Humbert receives a phone call in his motel room from an unknown man about Lolita. Worried, Humbert returns to the hospital to pick her up, and she is gone. The nurse at the front desk tells him she left earlier with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts.Some years later, Humbert receives a letter from 'Mrs. Richard T. Schiller', Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a nearly-deaf Korean War veteran named Dick, and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home, where Lolita waits. Humbert finds that she is now 17-going-on-18, a roundly pregnant woman wearing eyeglasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, as well as the pushy stranger who kept crossing their path. Lolita claims that she herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamor. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his ""art"" films.Humbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him, but she declines. Humbert gives Lolita $13,000, explaining that it's her share of the money from the sale of her mother's house. Leaving Lolita forever, Humbert surprises Quilty at his mansion where he kills him for abusing Lolita, thus bringing the film full circle. A disclaimer in the final shot reveals that Humbert died in prison of a heart attack while awaiting trial for Quilty's murder."

The Frakes - father Abel Frake, mother Melissa Frake, young adult son Wayne Frake and eighteen year old daughter Margy Frake - are a farming family from Banning, Texas getting ready to go to the multi-day Texas State Fair in Dallas as they do every year. Wayne is too preoccupied with entering his red sportster in the Gold Cup car races against his arch rival Red Hoertert than really notice that his unofficial fiancée Betty Jean isn't going to the fair. And Margy is just preoccupied with the thought of being in a relationship with a real man, instead of the courtship she has with the boorish Harry Ware. At the fair, Melissa is hoping she made the right decision regarding the mincemeat she has entered for judging, she dealing with her temperance view against Abel's assertion that the mincemeat would taste better with some brandy. The competition is even more cutthroat as commercial producers have entered several of the food competitions including mincemeat this year. And Abel may have some problems with his potentially prize winning boar, Blueboy, who is, for reasons unknown to Abel, lethargic. Wayne forgets all about Betty Jean when he meets Emily Porter, a performer and model at the fair. Emily, who travels the fair circuit, admits to Wayne that there have been a long line of men like him, although she admits to herself that none have been ""him"" for who she is also falling. Similarly, Margy forgets all about Harry when she meets Jerry Dundee, an on-camera personality covering various aspects of the fair. Jerry is less forthright with Margy than Emily was with Wayne that he too has had his fair share of women, however none quite as trusting as Margy. Can both the Frake children's romances extend beyond the length of the fair, especially considering their big city versus farm life differences, Emily's which would naturally have her on the next train to the next fair, and Jerry's which may take him to a more lucrative job with some national scope?—Huggo"

Young Helen Keller, blind, deaf, and mute since infancy, is in danger of being sent to an institution. Her inability to communicate has left her frustrated and violent.

Helen is initially resistant, but Annie gradually forms a bond with her and shows Helen ways of reaching others.—Jwelch5742 The true story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan, a gripping battle to overcome impossible obstacles and the struggle to communicate. As a young girl, Helen Keller is stricken with scarlet fever. The illness leaves her blind, mute, and deaf. Sealed off from the world, Helen cannot communicate with anyone, nor anyone with her. Often frustrated and desperate, Helen flies into uncontrollable rages and tantrums that terrify her hopeless family. The gifted teacher Annie Sullivan is summoned by the family to help the girl understand the world from which she is isolated, freeing Helen Keller from her internal prison forever.—alfiehitchie On a night in 1882, at the Alabama home of Captain and Mrs. Keller, a doctor examines a baby in a crib while her parents stand anxiously by. At last he smiles, and tells them the crisis has passed, she will recover from the illness. Her parents respond with joy and relief. Captain Keller (Victor Jory) goes with the doctor to see him out. Mrs. Keller (Inga Swenson) stays with the baby, smiling, talking, gently tucking the covers around her. Something about the baby's face catches her attention. She is at first puzzled, then frightened. She calls out for Captain Keller, who returns at a run. She blurts out her fears to him, he grabs up the lantern, and waves it before the baby's eyes, and screams her name in an attempt to get a reaction...all without effect. As a result of her illness, Baby Helen is now irrevocably blind and deaf.By 1887, Helen (Patty Duke) has grown into a healthy, but extremely difficult, child. The adults in the household--Captain and Mrs. Keller, Great Aunt Ev (Kathleen Comegys), Helen's older half-brother James (Andrew Prine) and the domestic help--have all given up trying to communicate with her or control her. She is allowed to wander wherever she wants, and do as she pleases. But after an incident in which she flings her new baby sister violently out of her cradle so she can use it for her doll, it is clear something must be done about her, and soon. Mrs. Keller can't bear the thought of having her shut up in an asylum, so Captain Keller reluctantly agrees to find a teacher/companion for her. Annie Sullivan (Anne Bancroft), a 20-year-old Irish-American girl, newly graduated from the Perkins Institute for the Blind in South Boston, is recommended for the position. She is still recovering from a series of operations that have only partially restored her own vision, she has a reputation for being stubborn and is haunted by a tragic childhood. But she has a plan, and is greatly determined to make a place for herself in the world, and a better world for her new student.At the Keller's home, her first meeting with Helen is promising. She quickly recognizes Helen's intelligence and curiosity. She has brought a doll for the little girl and Helen is delighted with it. Annie seizes the opportunity to introduce Helen to the finger alphabet for the deaf by spelling the word ""doll"" against Helen's palm. Intrigued, Helen spells it back to her, imitating the letters perfectly. Pleased, Annie tries another word...but Helen is more interested in the doll than the new finger game. Annie makes the mistake of trying to take the doll away from her, and Helen uses the doll to lambaste her in the mouth. While Annie is surveying the damage, Helen quickly locks her in the bedroom, takes the key and runs away.Annie is able to get her employers' attention and alert them to her dilemma. In the uproar that follows, Mrs. Keller searches Helen for the key, but doesn't find it, so Captain Keller decides the best way to effect a rescue is to put a ladder up to the bedroom window, climb it, and carry Annie back down. Despite Annie's protests that she can climb down herself, she makes the descent seated precariously on Captain Keller's shoulder. Crisis averted, Captain Keller orders everyone back inside to sit down to lunch.Annie stays behind for a moment or two to watch Helen, who is sitting quietly by the water pump on the well cover, holding her doll. After a moment, she gets up and furtively feels around for anyone else who might still be present. At last, satisfied that she's alone, she takes the key to Annie's bedroom door out of her mouth, and drops it into the well through a crack in the well cover. Annie observes this with mingled amusement and irritation...and she promises Helen (and herself) that she won't be gotten rid of so easily.Next day at breakfast, Annie watches in disgust as Helen wanders about the table, taking food from each person's plate with her hands, and cramming it into her mouth. The adults pay no attention to her, obviously accustomed to this behavior. When Helen reaches for Annie's plate, Annie quietly fends off her hand. Helen is shocked at first, considers what has happened--and reaches again, all the more determined to take something from this stranger's plate. A scuffle ensues...Captain Keller intercedes, explaining to Annie that they've found this to be the easiest course, and the only way they can have a relatively civilized meal. But Annie decides it's high time to begin her student's education...starting with ordinary table manners. She chases the family out of the house, and the battle is on.It's a long and violent process...Helen is as determined as Annie, and both girls know this is more than just a fight about plates and napkins. After a struggle which lasts into the afternoon and leaves both girls battered and bruised, Annie emerges as the victor...barely. Afterward, Helen runs outside to her mother for comfort, and Mrs. Keller angrily asks Annie what happened. ""She ate from her own plate,"" replies Annie, softly. ""She ate with a spoon. Herself. And she folded her napkin."" Mrs. Keller receives this news in complete wonder, her anger gone in a moment. ""Folded her napkin?"" she repeats. ""The room's a wreck,"" Annie says, wryly, ""but her napkin is folded."" Annie turns wearily back into the house. ""Folded her napkin,"" Mrs. Keller murmurs, ""My Helen folded her napkin,"" as she holds Helen close in her armsCaptain Keller is in a thundering rage. He wants that ""half-blind Yankee schoolgirl"" gone immediately, but Mrs. Keller persuades him to let her stay. Nevertheless, he tells Annie, there are a number of conditions that must be met. He begins to lay down the law, but Annie interrupts him. She tells them that she has no hope of being able to make any progress with Helen under the current circumstances. Mrs. Keller pleads with her not to give up on Helen. She tells her how bright Helen was when she was a baby...able to ask for water (to say wah-wah) at a remarkably early age...and how heartbreaking it has been to feel her slipping farther away with each passing year...and how like the lost lamb in the parable, she loves her all the more. Annie listens, not unsympathetically; nevertheless, she tells her bluntly that she thinks Helen's greatest handicap is not deafness and blindness, but her family's love and pity. ""Why, even a dog you housebreak,"" she scolds. But Annie has no intention of giving up on Helen...""Why, only today I saw how much needs to be done,"" she declares.She has been exploring the grounds, and has found a little cottage that isn't used, except during the hunting season. She asks that they furnish this cottage with a couple of beds, a table and a couple of chairs, and let the cook's young son, Percy (Robert Darden), sleep there to be available for errands. She instructs them to bring Helen there after a long buggy ride, so she won't know where she is, and leave her there, completely in her care. ""She must be dependent on me for everything...for food, for water...even for the very air she breathes,"" she says, because any of these might be an avenue through which she can reach her. Mrs. Keller eagerly agrees, and after a while so does Captain Keller...reluctantly...for two weeks only. After that, whether she has been able to reach her or not, they must both return to the main house.Preparations are made, and Helen arrives at the cottage. She is pleased to find some of her favorite toys and clothes waiting for her, in a basket in the middle of the floor. Then she has a sudden premonition of something amiss, and begins to make the sign that means she wants her mother. Her parents quickly withdraw, and as Helen gropes around the room, she encounters Annie. In rage and horror at being left alone with this hated person, Helen goes wild, trashing the house and its contents. Physically and emotionally exhausted, she finally falls asleep, clutching her doll.Annie hits on a plan to get Helen to tolerate her: She wakes Percy, and brings him in from the other room, and has him stand near Helen. Helen recoils at first, then recognizes him, and is overjoyed to have him there. Annie sits on the other side of Percy, takes his hand, and begins to show him how to spell using the finger signs. When Helen discovers what's going on, she tries at first to keep Percy away from Annie, then curiosity overcomes her and she tries to ""eavesdrop"" on the new signs Annie is teaching...but Annie lightly flicks her hand away. At last, consumed with jealousy, she pushes Percy out of the way, and holds up her own hand defiantly, to be taught the new signs herself. Annie signs the word ""milk"" against her palm, and Helen repeats it back to her. Annie gives her a glass of milk, and helps her into bed. Detente has been reached, and the work can begin.In the days that follow, Helen learns many new things...how to wash and dress herself, how to feed and clean up after herself...how to climb a tree, how to wade in a creek...how to play hide the thimble. She also learns many new words. But she still doesn't understand what she's doing, and in quiet moments it's clear she misses her mother and her old way of life.Mrs. Keller has been missing Helen, too. As previously agreed, she comes to the cottage each day to watch her without her knowledge, and to learn from Annie the alphabet Helen is also learning. She is pleased with Helen's progress and shares Annie's hope that some spark of understanding will eventually ignite in Helen's brain. But the two weeks Annie was given to teach Helen without family interference is drawing to a close, and Mrs. Keller is not willing to persuade Captain Keller to give her an extension. On the last day, when Mrs. Keller comes for her, Annie must hand her over.Annie feels that she has failed. She watches sadly as Helen goes through the house gathering all the keys from all the doors. She takes them to her mother and puts them in her pocket...a gesture that clearly indicates she wants everything to go back to the way it was. Just before dinner, Captain Keller calls Annie into his study, and hands her a check for her first month's wages, with a little speech of congratulations and gratitude. Annie confides her fear to him, that Helen will slip back into her old habits, and asks his help to keep Helen to what she's learned. He readily agrees...and then invites her to a special homecoming dinner for Helen, featuring all her favorite foods.They sit down, and grace is said, and Annie hands Helen her napkin...and watches as she drops it on the floor. It was very subtly done...could have been an accident. Annie picks it up, and puts it back on her lap...Helen removes it, and drops it on the floor again. Annie rises to take Helen from the table, but she flees to her mother for comfort. Mrs. Keller tries to smooth things over, saying that it's only a napkin, nothing breakable. ""And everything I've taught her is?"" retorts Annie. Mrs. Keller hesitates, then relents, handing Helen over to Annie. But Captain Keller intervenes this time, saying there is no need to discipline the child on her first night back. He sits Helen down, and fills a plate for her, hands her a spoon, and goes back to his own place. Helen throws the spoon across the room, grabs a handful of food and tries to stuff it into her mouth. Annie grabs her and drags her away from the table. In the struggle that follows, Helen douses Annie with the contents of the water pitcher, and Annie grabs the pitcher and Helen, and storms majestically out of the room. Captain Keller begins to follow, intent on intervening again, but his way is blocked by his son, James...who finally finds the courage to tell his father he is wrong...that he must back down and allow this Yankee girl to teach Helen the discipline she needs...so that she can go on learning.Outside, Annie drags Helen to the pump, to make her refill the pitcher. Helen is desperately making her sign for her mother, and Annie says coldly, ""She's not here."" She makes Helen hold the pitcher under the pump, while she works the pump handle. As the cold water pours over the pitcher and Helen's hand, Annie automatically spells the word ""water"" against her free hand. ""W-A-T-E-R, water,"" she says aloud, a lesson she has repeated many times. ""It has a name, and the name stands for the thing..."" She stops, noticing that Helen is standing transfixed, a look of profound realization dawning on her face. The pitcher drops from her hands and shatters. Something is coming to her out of the past. The water from the pump is dripping on her hands. ""Wah.....Wah...."" she says, with great difficulty....""Wah....Wah.""The water has stopped flowing. Helen hits the faucett frantically, to indicate she wants it to flow again. Annie pumps, and the water flows over Helen's hands again. ""Wah....Wah..."" she says...and reaches for Annie's hand to spell the word against her palm. Annie puts Helen's hands on her face and nods to confirm that she is correct. Helen grabs the pump handle and pumps wildly herself, then holding Annie's hand under the stream of water, she spells the word against her palm again. With Helen's hands on her face, Annie nods again: this is, indeed, water.She knows! The connection has been made, the spark has ignited, and now Helen knows! And suddenly she realizes that this is only the start...that there is much, much more for her to learn, and she wants to know it all, everything, all at once! In a frenzy, she runs around, dragging Annie after her, touching things and then holding out her hand for Annie to spell their names. Annie follows, spelling to her as fast as she can, and she calls out for Mrs. Keller to come out. The whole family spills out of the house, and when Helen bumps against her mother and father, Annie spells each of their names to her in turn, and cries out to them jubilantly that Helen finally knows!As they embrace her, Annie goes back to sit by the pump on the well cover, overcome with emotion. After a few moments, Helen pulls free from her sobbing parents, and finds her way over to Annie. Shyly, she points toward her...she wants to know her name...this wonderful stranger who has turned the light back on in her mind, and put the world into her hand. Annie spells the word ""Teacher"" against her palm. Helen goes back to her mother, reaches into her pocket for the door keys she cached there earlier. She spells ""Teacher"" against her mother's palm, and brings the keys back to Annie.Later that night, Annie sits alone in a rocker on the upper porch of the house. A door behind her opens, and Helen comes out to her. She kisses Annie and cuddles into her lap. Lost and found...rescuer and rescued...combatants and companions...two turbulent souls, at peace with each other, and themselves, at last."

A group of Hebrews searching for a new home approach Sodom and Gomorrah, twin cities ruled by the ruthless Queen Bera. Bera permits the Hebrews to remain outside the cities and farm the land along the Jordan River, in the hopes that they will serve as a buffer against the fierce, nomadic Helamites, who have enlisted the aid of Bera's vice-ridden brother, Astaroth, in plotting to take control of the two cities.

Though Lot prospers, he gradually sees the corrupting influence of life in the city. Lot kills Astaroth, who has violated both of his daughters, and Bera has him imprisoned. Two angels appear before Lot and instruct him to lead his people away from the wickedness of the cities before sunset, when Jehovah will destroy both Sodom and Gomorrah.

Ildith ignores the Lord's warning that ""he who looks back upon the destruction of this place, does so in regret."" As she turns her head toward her former home, a bolt of lightning cracks across the sky, and she turns into a pillar of salt."

In a tale that almost redefines sibling rivalry, faded actresses Blanche and 'Baby' Jane Hudson live together. Jane was by far the most famous when she performed with their father in vaudeville but as they got older, it was Blanche who became the finer actress, which Jane still resents. Blanche is now confined to a wheelchair and Jane is firmly in control. As time goes by, Jane exercises greater and greater control over her sister, intercepting her letters and ensuring that few if anyone from the outside has any contact with her. As Jane slowly loses her mind, she torments her sister going to ever greater extremes.—garykmcd In 1917, Baby Jane is a famous, but spoiled child star that performs a show with her father under the jealous look of her sister Blanche. In 1935, Blanche Hudson becomes a famous and glamorous actress in Hollywood and the untalented Baby Jane Hudson only acts because Blanche forces the producers to give parts to her. One night, they go to a party and there is a car accident. In 1962, Blanche is a crippled woman that has been left wheelchair-bound after the accident that lives with her alcoholic sister Baby Jane in a decaying Hollywood mansion. Baby Jane does not recall the accident since she was drunk and is in absolute control over Blanche that is completely isolated without any contact with the outside world and dumping her correspondence in the trash. As Baby Jane becomes more insane, she decides to return to the stage and hires the idle Edwin Flagg to play piano. Meanwhile she continues to torment Blanche and her cruelty increases.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Elderly sisters Blanche Hudson and Jane Hudson, who now live together in a house owned by Blanche, have each had their brush with fame. As a child, Jane, better known as Baby Jane, was a spoiled vaudeville star, doted on by their manager father to the exclusion of timid Blanche, who was hidden behind the scenes. As young adults, Blanche became a movie star, and used her fame and power at the studio to get Jane movie roles, much to the studio's chagrin, they who felt Jane more a liability than asset. Blanche's stardom continued until her ""accident"" which has left her wheelchair-bound and now largely dependent upon Jane for the most basic of needs. Blanche is enjoying a resurgence in popularity with her old movies being shown on television, which irks A-type Jane, whose celebrity is largely forgotten. As such, an angry Jane is in the process of trying to reestablish her career by resurrecting her Baby Jane act. To take Blanche down another notch, Jane also uses total control and other forms of psychological torture to torment Blanche, who feels largely helpless as she can't get messages out of the house or receive incoming messages without Jane knowing or approving. Blanche believes Jane is emotionally disturbed and wants to drive her crazy, or worse kill her. The truth behind some long standing Hollywood gossip may be the tipping point in resolving the battle between the sisters, but not before some collateral damage.—Huggo Two aging sisters, Blanche and Jane, share a large house. Jane was once a child star and Blanche was, in adult life, a star of the silver screen. Blanche's career ended when she was left paralysed from the waist down in an accident involving Jane. Now Jane looks after Blanche in the house, though not very well. Filled with bitterness at her own cinematic career never taking off, envious of Blanche's career and money, an alcoholic and a touch deranged, Jane goes out of her way to torment her sister.—grantss In 1917, nine-year-old ""Baby"" Jane Hudson (Julie Allred) is a vaudevillian child star. She performs to adoring crowds and inspires the creation of a rather expensive Baby Jane doll. Jane is shown to have become a spoiled brat whose doting stage-father Ray Hudson (Dave Willock) gives in to her whims and demands while her disapproving mother and jealous, overlooked 11-year-old sister Blanche Hudson (Gina Gillespie) watch from the sidelines.By 1935, the now grown sisters' roles have reversed. Both are movie stars, but Blanche is the successful and glamorous one, while Jane's films have flopped. Unable to establish her talent as an adult actress, Jane has taken to drinking. One night after coming home from a party, their car pulls up the driveway to their mansion and one of the sisters steps out to open the gate. When she reaches the gate, the sister who is driving steps on the accelerator, smashing the car into the gate.In 1962, a wheelchair bound Blanche (Joan Crawford) and a severely aged Jane (Bette Davis) are living together in a creepy mansion in Los Angeles. Blanche lives primarily in her bedroom watching her old movies on television and reliving her former career. Jane is an antagonist who fights with her sister constantly, drinks excessively, and wears caked-on makeup in an effort to appear young again. Blanche is heavily dependent on her bitter, abusive sister, except for her friendly relationship with their cleaning woman, Elvira Stitt (Maidie Norman). Elvira is concerned for Blanches well-being at the hands of ""crazy"" Jane, but Blanche defends her. Elvira tells Blanche that she has discovered her sister has been opening her mail and dumping it in the trash, but Blanche is slow to condemn her and shows concern for her sister's welfare.In her own world, Jane is reliving her childhood success in a dark, disturbing manner. She is lost in her memories when she sees her reflection in the mirror and is horrified. At that moment Blanche calls for her sister with an annoying, repeated use of a bedside buzzer from her room: She wants to know why she cannot call out on the telephone was it left off the hook downstairs? Jane is annoyed when Blanche informs her she may be selling the house. Jane fights with her sister, fearing what will become of her, and rips the telephone cord from the wall, further isolating Blanche in her room. When Jane brings Blanche's lunch afterwards, Blanche finds under the silver serving dish lies her beloved parakeet, dead on a bed of tomato slices.Jane makes herself up to go out and place an advertisement for a piano player so she can restart her performing career. While she is out, Blanche tries to get the attention of her neighbor, Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee), who is tending her flowers below Blanche's window. When Blanche cannot get her attention, she writes a note pleading for help and throws it from her window. Unfortunately, Jane returns at that moment and the distraction of the car coming up the driveway prevents Mrs. Bates from seeing the crumpled paper. Jane finds the note, however, and when she brings Blanche's dinner up, she argues with her sister again, telling her the house is hers and it will never be sold. Jane mocks her sister's kindly concern and drops the folded note in her lap. Jane leaves the room, and when Blanche goes to her serving tray for dinner, she cannot bring herself to touch it.The next morning when Elvira arrives, Jane tells her she can have the day off. Jane's abuse of Blanche continues and they fight again when she brings Blanche her lunch. Blanche has not touched her dinner from the night before and wants to know why her breakfast had not been brought. Jane responds because she had not eaten her dinner and Jane tauntingly eats from the previous night's plate. As she takes the dinner tray away, she tells her sister they have rats in the basement, and when Blanche goes to eat her lunch, she finds a dead rat on the plate. Blanche screams and Jane laughs evilly at her sister's despair.Meanwhile, a talented, down-and-out, overweight young man named Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) sees Jane's newspaper advertisement and phones the Hudson house to make an appointment for that afternoon. Edwin lives with his mother and hopes to use this opportunity to land some cash for himself and his mother.When Edwin shows up at the house, Jane grotesquely performs her signature song from her childhood, ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy,"" with Edwin playing the piano. Edwin tries to conceal his disgust. Jane brags about who she was as a child and shows him a scrapbook of herself. At this time, Blanche uses her buzzer repeatedly to call her sister, wanting to know who the visitor is. Enraged, Jane goes upstairs, confronts Blanche, and rips the buzzer out of the wall and slaps her sister.Back in the living room, Jane and Edwin agree to his salary and they plot their moves. Jane then drives him home. While shes out, Blanche goes into Jane's room looking for food (by now, she hasn't eaten in a couple of days) and discovers that Jane has practiced forging her signature and is writing checks under Blanche's name. She works her way down the stairs to the telephone. Blanche calls Jane's doctor and tells him that she needs help and asks if he could come to the house right away.Jane comes home to find Blanche on the phone, talking to the doctor. Blanche abruptly ends the conversation and tries to make excuses in front of her enraged sister. Jane beats her as she lies on the floor, kicking her in the head and stomach until she is unconscious. Jane then calls the doctor back and, disguising her voice as Blanche, tells him not to come because ""Jane found another doctor"". Then Jane drags her sister to her room, ties her by her arms, gags her, and leaves her there.The next day, Elvira arrives to see Blanche. Jane tells her that her services are no longer needed and dismisses her. Suspicious, Elvira sneaks into the house when Jane leaves for the bank to get money to pay Edwin. She finds Blanche's room locked and is attempting to remove the door from the hinges when Jane comes home and catches her. Upon Elvira's demands, Jane gives her the key, and as the maid enters the darkened room to find Blanche bound and gagged, Jane uses a hammer to kill Elvira. Jane sinks deeper into her delusions, saying, ""If only they had loved me enough."" Edwin rings the doorbell, but Jane does not answer, ""Not now Edwin, not now,"" and when he leaves, she sobs in despair. She drags Elvira's dead body from the house and disposes of it by dropping it some distance away in a garbage bin.One week later, the police phone the Hudson house and tell Jane that a cousin of her maid reported her missing. Jane tells them that she hasn't seen Elvira in a week. A panicked Jane then prepares to leave with her sister, fearing the police will discover what she's done. Suddenly, a drunken Edwin shows up at the house, demanding to receive his first payment. While he is there, a weakened Blanche is able to knock over a bedside table in her room. Edwin hears the noise, goes upstairs to investigate, and finds Blanche tied to her bed. He is shocked at her ""dying"" condition as she begs for his help. Edwin runs from the house and gets away from Jane. Desperate, Jane puts her sister in the car and drives to the beach.The next morning, the search is on for the missing Hudson sisters. Elvira's body was found by the police, and there are bulletins on the radio. Blanche, starved and dehydrated, is lying on the sand with Jane sitting beside her, oblivious to her plight. Aware that she is dying, Blanche tells Jane the truth of what happened years before. It was she, Blanche, who tried to run over her drunken sister. Jane, however, moved out of the way in time and Blanche had slammed into the gate and snapped her spine, but managed to drag herself out of the car and up to the wrecked gate. Because Jane was too drunk to realize what happened, she has long believed that she was responsible for her sisters condition. Jane sadly asks, ""You mean all this time we could have been friends?""However, this revelation comes too little too late for Jane, whose mental health has completely deteriorated by this point. Jane runs to a beach-side concession booth to get ice cream cones for the two of them. Two policemen arrive and intercept Jane as she is returning with the ice cream cones. As a crowd of beach-goers begin surrounding her, Jane realizes that she again has the attention she's long craved, and she dances before the onlookers, joyfully happy at last, in her decayed imagination. The police spot a motionless Blanche lying on the sand and break through the crowd to help her as the deranged Jane continues to dance.THE END"

Atticus Finch is currently defending Tom Robinson, a Black man accused of raping a white woman. Meanwhile, Jem and Scout are intrigued by their neighbors, the Radleys, in particular the mysterious, seldom-seen Boo Radley.—grantss 1930s Maycomb, Alabama. With America struggling to find its feet during the Great Depression, Atticus Finch, a widowed father and fiercely-principled lawyer, takes the knotty case of young Black worker Tom Robinson to defend him in court. But as the news of Mayella Ewell's sexual assault spreads like wildfire, public opinion turns against Finch. As a result, Atticus and his kids find themselves targeted by the locals--a tight-knit community unable to forgive and forget. However, this has nothing to do with racial prejudices. The issue is one of justice, not color. Will impartiality and reason prevail?—Nick Riganas Atticus Finch is an idealistic lawyer in the fictional town of Maycomb, a racially-divided Alabama town, in the early 1930s. Finch agrees to defend a young Black man who is accused of raping a white woman. Many of the townspeople try to get Atticus to pull out of the trial, but he decides to go ahead. As one begins observing the reasons that make his defense far from easy, it becomes evident that nobody in this town seems wiling to believe in the innocence of an accused Negro man. How will the trial turn out? Will it effect any changes in racial attitudes in Maycomb?—Brian Daly <bd64kcmo@aol.com> Through the eyes of ""Scout,"" a feisty grade-school-aged tomboy, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" carries the viewer on an odyssey through the fires of prejudice in early-1930s Maycomb, Alabama. Peopled with a cast of eccentrics, the tired and sleepy town finds itself the venue of the trial of Tom Robinson, a young Black man falsely accused of raping an ignorant white woman. Scout and her older brother Jem's widower father Atticus Finch, a deeply-principled man, is appointed to defend Tom, for whom a guilty verdict from an all-white jury is a foregone conclusion.—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> The titles appear as a young child babbles while picking through childhood mementos found in a cigar box.An adult woman is recalling formative events of her childhood in the small Alabama town of Macomb, that was ""a tired old town even in 1932"" when she ""first knew it."" They had recently been told they ""had nothing to fear but fear itself,"" which refers to FDR's inaugural address of March 1933. She was six years old that summer.Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch (Mary Badham), wearing bib overalls and her hair in bangs, greets Walter Cunningham, a farmer who is dropping off some hickory nuts. She summons her father Atticus (Gregory Peck) to thank him. When Mr. Cunningham leaves, Atticus explains that he is embarrassed to have to pay for ""some legal work"" in this way.Their cook Calpurnia (Estelle Evans) wants Scout's older brother Jem (Phillip Alford) to come in for breakfast, but he is sulking in his treehouse because Atticus says he is ""too old to play football for the Methodists."" Miss Maudie (Rosemary Murphy) across the street assures them that he is respected as a very skilled lawyer.In the collard patch of their neighbor they discover a boy a little older than Scout. He is Dill (John Mosna), staying with his Aunt Stephanie for the summer. They tell him about the neighbor two houses away they have never seen. Jem describes him as a homicidal maniac of frightening appearance. Dill's Aunt Stephanie (Alice Ghostly) adds to the story.At 5:00 o'clock they walk to meet Atticus, returning home, and pass by elderly Mrs. Dubose, who rails at them from her porch. Atticus handles her with his customary grace and sensitivity.That evening, Atticus listens to Scout read aloud. When she asks about Boo Radley, Atticus reminds her that he has told them ""to leave those poor people alone."" They reminisce about her mother, who died when Scout was two and Jem was six. Judge Taylor (Paul Fix) comes to ask Atticus to defend in a problematic case involving a man named Tom Robinson. He is relieved and grateful when Atticus agrees to.The next day, Dill dares Jem to go up to the Radley's porch. Jem can't avoid it when Scout, rolling in a loose tire, ends up at the foot of their steps. Dill suggests they all go to the courthouse to see where Boo Radley had been locked up. They end up looking in to the preliminary hearing concerning Tom Robinson. Tom is a black man who has been accused of raping and beating a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Bob Ewell (James Anderson), the girl's father, confronts Atticus in the hallway. He tells Atticus he is concerned that ""people are saying you believed Tom Robinson's story agin ourn."" He becomes quite hostile, but Atticus remains calm, and cold.At night, Dill prompts Jem to look in a back window of the Radley house. The shadow of a man in a baggy shirt looms over Jem, and the shadow of his hand reaches out to touch Jem. When Jem cowers in fright, the man quietly withdraws. The children flee. Jem's overalls get caught in the chickenwire fence, and he has to leave them. Dill is called home, and he says, ""See you next summer."" When Jem goes back to get his pants, Scout hears a gunshot, but Jem returns safely. They go around to the street to find the neighbors in an uproar because Mr. Radley had fired to frighten ""a prowler."" Atticus calmly says the excitement is over.On her first day of school, Scout feels very awkward wearing a dress. She has a rough first day, and gets in a fight with young Walter Cunningham, Jr. Jem breaks up the fight and invites Walter to have lunch at their house. Jem learns that Walter has his own gun, and hunts rabbits and squirrels with his dad for food. Atticus tells of getting his first gun, when his father told him it was ""sin to shoot a mockingbird,"" because it does no harm, but only sings. Scout is appalled when Walter drowns his plate in syrup, but Calpurnia gives her a lecture on hospitality. That evening, when she complains about school, Atticus teaches her about empathy and compromise.Jem spots a rabid dog wandering down their street, approaching their house. Calpurnia takes the children inside and calls Atticus, who shows up with the local sheriff, Heck Tate (Frank Overton). Tate has a hunting rifle but doesn't believe he can make the shot. He asks Atticus to shoot the dog; Atticus is reluctant but takes up the rifle when Tate insists. After removing his glasses, Atticus shoots the dog dead with one shot, much to the astonishment of Jem. Tate starts to tell Jem and Scout that Atticus is the best shot in the county but Atticus stops him and leaves with the sheriff.Both children ask to go with Atticus when he visits Tom Robinson's wife, Helen. Waiting in the car, Scout falls asleep, but Jem is frightened when drunken Bob Ewell lurches against the window, and calls Atticus ""nigger lover."" Atticus reassures Jem, ""He's all bluff,"" and says that he wished he could keep the ugly things in this world away from them, but knows that is not possible. When he drives Calpurnia home, Jem waits nervously, listening to the spooky night sounds.Scout continues to have fights at school, because people denigrate Atticus for defending a Negro. He explains that he has to defend Tom Robinson, or he could not hold his head up in town. He tells her she must not fight, no matter what people say.In a hole in a tree in front of the Radley's, the children find two carved figures that look just like them. Mr. Radley appears and cements up the hole. That night, Jem shows Scout a cigar box filled with all sorts of little gifts that he had found in the tree. He tells her how the night he went back to get his ""britches"" he had found them ""folded across the fence.""When summer comes, Dill returns, and Tom Robinson's trial is due to start soon. He has spent the year in the Abbotsville jail, because the Sheriff thought he would be safer there. Now he is back at the town jail, and Heck Tate expects trouble. Atticus takes a reading light, and leaves. Jem wants to check on him, and he and Scout and Dill walk downtown. Atticus is reading in a chair on the jail porch. Suddenly, numerous cars arrive, and men with rifles approach. The children push their way forward. Jem refuses when Atticus tells them to go home. There is an impasse, until Scout recognizes Mr. Cunningham, and politely and in and empathetic tone, speaks to him about the legal work Atticus is doing for him. Something in Scout's tone makes Cunningham look ashamed and he gets the mob to leave with him.Next morning, crowds arrive to attend the trial, and the children go down to the courthouse. They are able to find a place with Rev. Sykes (Bill Walker) in the gallery, with all the black people who have turned out for the trial.In the Sheriff's testimony Atticus establishes that Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox) was badly beaten on the right side of her face and had finger marks all around her neck.Bob Ewell testifies that he returned from one of his fields to hear Mayella screaming, and that he saw who did it. Ewell gets up to leave and Atticus has to tell him to remain for his questions. He asks why no doctor was called, and gets Ewell to write his name. The judge points out that this shows he is left handed. Ewell feels tricked.Mayella testifies that she asked Tom to ""bust up"" a chifforobe (a piece of furniture like a wardrobe) in the yard, and that when she went in to get him a nickel he followed her and attacked her. Atticus asks her if her father got riled when he drank, and asks if he had ever beaten her. Mayella is extremely uncomfortable, and her testimony is inconsistent. When Tom (Brock Peters) stands to be identified, Atticus asks him to catch a small drinking glass he tosses to him. Atticus tells Tom to try catching it with his left hand, to which Tom replies he can't; his left arm is crippled because he caught in a cotton gin when he was twelve. When he asks Mayella how Tom could have done what she claims, she breaks down and rails at Atticus and the jury, saying she wants the man guilty of beating her punished. She then refuses to say anymore and is taken back to her father.The prosecutor rests, and Atticus calls Tom Robinson to the stand. Tom is dignified and articulate, but increasingly uncomfortable. He testifies that he busted up a chifforobe for Mayella ""way last spring . . . way over a year ago,"" and refused the nickel she offered. After that he did lots of favors that she asked him to do, until one day she got him in the house and grabbed him and told him to kiss her. Bob Ewell ""cussed at her from the window"" and said he ""was gonna kill her.""In cross examination, the prosecutor (William Windom) gets Tom to admit he is ""strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor."" He scoffs at Tom's helpfulness and says: ""You felt sorry for her? A white woman?""After the prosecutor has spoken his closing argument, Atticus is allowed to give his. Atticus points out the lack of evidence, the fact that no doctor examined Mayella and that Mayella was beaten by someone left handed. He says that he has pity for Mayella, ""a victim of cruel poverty and ignorance,"" but cannot let her put a man's life at stake to cover her guilt at breaking the social code.In the gallery, Jem watches the proceedings, mesmerized. He asks the Reverend how long the jury has been out deciding the verdict. The Reverend tells them it's been nearly two hours when the jury returns, bringing back a verdict of guilty. The judge dismisses them and leaves, slamming his door. Atticus tells Tom that he had told Helen they would ""probably lose this one.""All the white people leave the court. The blacks in the gallery watch Atticus gather his papers. Gradually, they all stand out of respect. Rev. Sykes says, ""Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your fathers passin'.""Back at home, Miss Maudie tells a disconsolate Jem that his father is one of those ""men in this world who are born to do our unpleasant jobs for us."" Sheriff Tate arrives and talks with Atticus, who then reports that Tom has been killed. A deputy had shot at him and had ""missed his aim"" when Tom ""broke loose and ran . . . like a crazy man."" He says that on appeal they would have had ""more than a good chance.""Jem insists on accompanying Atticus to go tell Tom's family. Bob Ewell arrives and spits at Atticus, who calmly wipes his face and leaves.In October, Scout wears a ham costume in a school pageant; she is dressed as a large ham. She wears it walking home with Jem after dark because she couldn't find her overalls after the performance was over. In a small grove they often walk through as a shortcut, they are attacked by an unseen assailant. Jem yells loudly and is thrown to the ground, unconscious. The attacker grabs Scout. Another man in a baggy shirt arrives and there is a struggle with their attacker. Scout cannot see well from inside her costume, but she hears a loud grunt and sees the man in the baggy shirt carrying Jem to their house. Scout wriggles out of her ham costume and gets home finding Jem is unconscious, with a badly broken arm. Atticus runs out of the house yelling for Scout and she runs into his arms sobbing and babbling about what happened.After a doctor has come to take care of Jem, Sheriff Tate investigates the scene where the kids were attacked and reports that Bob Ewell has been killed with ""a kitchen knife."" He asks Scout to tell him what happened. She only has limited detail but says she was saved from Ewell by a man she couldn't see very well. Just then, Scout sees the man who rescued them behind Jem's door, and realizes it is Boo Radley (Robert Duvall). He recoils slightly when Atticus gently pulls the door away from him, allowing Scout to see his face. She takes him by the hand, and invites him to ""say goodnight to Jem."" When he hesitates to touch Jem, she reassures him that he ""can pet him,"" since he is asleep. Boo strokes Jem's head gently.Scout and Boo go out to their front porch, sitting quietly while Atticus discusses the incident with Tate. Atticus, thinking Jem wielded the knife, begins to consider a case of self defense involving Jem, when the sheriff corrects him. He says decisively: ""Bob Ewell fell on his knife."" He implies that Boo must have killed Bob Ewell. He says he feels Boo did a civic duty ""to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed,"" and that to ""drag him into the limelight"" would be ""a sin."" Scout agrees-- that it would be like shooting a mockingbird.Atticus shakes Boo's hand, and says, ""Thank you, Arthur, for my children."" Scout walks Boo back to his front door."
Harakiri,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056058/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When a ronin requesting seppuku at a feudal lord's palace is told of the brutal suicide of another ronin who previously visited, he reveals how their pasts are intertwined - and in doing so challenges the clan's integrity. Peace in 17th-century Japan causes the Shogunate's breakup of warrior clans, throwing thousands of samurai out of work and into poverty. An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.—Kevin Rayburn <kprayb01@homer.louisville.edu> In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan following the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide). Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe, who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master. Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil A samurai, Hanshiro Tsugumo, arrives at the house of the Iyi Clan with an unusual request. Due to his circumstances, he wishes to commit harakiri, ritual suicide, in the courtyard of the house. Turns out this is not such an unusual request: the clan has had such requests before, though the requestor's intentions weren't always honourable. The Clan elder tells Tsugumo the story of the last samurai who made the request and how that ended. Will he still go through with it?—grantss ""Seppuku,"" or ""Harakiri"" has it is known in the West, is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending ones days. In this ritual, the performer opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is no need to be left for hours contemplating ones entrails. Another swordsman acting as a second, called ""kaishakunin,"" is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great ""shogunate"" dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the performer was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan!We are May 13, 1630, in Edo. Following the centralization of power by the Tokugawa Shogunate in the early 17th Century, few feudal clans were allowed to remain, leading to a substantial downsizing (but not off-shoring) in the samurai profession. A scrawny former retainer of the Lord of Geishu arrives at the gates of the official residence of Lord Iyi. This mysterious and somber ""ronin"" (un-retained samurai), Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), unemployed since the abolition of the Geishu Clan in 1619, requests the temporary hospitality of the Clan in order to end his life as a worthy samurai by committing harakiri.Hanshiro is not the first ronin to come knocking at the door of one of the local remaining feudal clans with such a request, including one most recently at Lord Iyis residence itself. In the beginning of this recession, the surviving clans were impressed by the steadfast ""samurai"" and generously turned them away with small alms. Unfortunately, this practice led to abuses on the part of some destitute ronin who faked the desire to commit ""harakiri"" in the hope of employment or of a small financial relief while retaining their lives (one must not be too harsh in judging these poor fellows, remembering that in those days unemployment compensation did not yet exist).The Iyi Clan elder, Kageyu Saito (Rentaro Mikuni) receives Tsugumo, but warns him against making such a request unless he is sincere. Saito tells Tsugomo of a recent tragic incident involving another ronin, Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama), who had come to the clan under the false pretence of committing harakiri with the hope of obtaining some money and being turned away safe and sound. Suspecting Motomes sincerity, the Clan entrapped him by calling his bluff, and forced him to go through his harakiri. The ritual was even crueler, as Motome, being totally destitute, had previously sold the razor-edged blades of his swords and replaced them with bamboo blades. Nevertheless, he was compelled to perform the ritual using these blades. The samurai carried a long sword and a short sword, each named differently depending on the occasion: ""tachi"" or ""katana"" and ""tanto"" or ""wakizashi"", respectively. These are the essential tools of his trade, and under no circumstances should he part with them, lest he become totally dishonored.Tsugomo is undeterred by this gruesome story and reaffirms his determination to commit harakiri. Saito, thinking that this event will serve as a good example for the troupes and will reinforce their morale, agrees to the request. Tsugomo takes his position, sitting on a small platform, in the middle of a sand-covered courtyard, with his wakizashi in front of him. The members of the Clan surround the courtyard and the ritual is presided over by the elder of the Clan.Tsugomo asks to be seconded by the number one swordsman of the Clan, Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsuro Tamba). He happens not to be present that day, and a messenger is sent to his home to summon him back to the Palace. In the meantime, Tsugomo, a superb storyteller, recounts the journey which brought him to this situation. Slowly, with a deep, gravelly voice, in a deliberate rhythm, he recalls his story, which could have been a bard reciting pages of the ""Iliad"" or of the ""Mahabarata."" He recalls how his best friend, Jinna Chijiiwa ((Yoshio Inaba), also a retainer of the Geishu Clan, committed harakiri upon being dismissed at the dissolution of the Clan. He had left a note asking Tsugomo to adopt his young son, Motome. Motome grew up with Tsugomos own daughter and eventually married her. Tsugomos narration melts into flashbacks of his past life.As the messenger returns with the news that Omokada has taken a leave of absence and cannot attend the ceremony, Tsugomo requests another kaishakunin, Hayato Yazaki (Ichirô Nakaya), but it turns out that he also happens not to be in attendance. Finally, Tsugumo names Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshio Aoki) who, surprise, is also absent. Saito, sensing a trap, but is still unable to comprehend the situation. He names a second himself, and orders for the ritual to proceed. Nevertheless, Tsugomo is able to buy enough time to finish his story. The family, although poor, was surviving until his daughter and grandchild became sick. And this is how, out of money, Motome, decided to try his luck and went to the residence of Lord Iyi.Saito, exasperated, orders his men to attack. At that moment, Tsugomo reaches in his kimono and throws on the ground three topknots, bearing the names of their former owners, who are none other than the three suggested seconds. In so doing, Tsugomo exposes the hypocrisy of these samurai, reminding his audience, To lose ones topknot is equivalent to losing ones life, a laxity and dishonor which even death cannot wipe away!Tsugomo ends his narrative with recalling how he met, one by one, in duels with the three now-indisposed samurai, and having won each encountered, proceeded to take their topknots instead of their lives, a supreme humiliation for a samurai. The final duel with the star swordsman of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death.The film ends in a well-choreographed combat. In an ultimate effort, badly wounded, Tsugomo seizes the Clans idol, the emblem and embodiment of the Clans honor, above his head and sends it crashing at his feet. Fittingly, the ""coup de grace"" to Tsogomos seppuku is not dispensed by a gallant swordsman, but by a cowardly platoon of musket-carrying warriors. Even to the end, bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai, is violated by the Clan. The battlefield is cleaned up and the Clans idol is restored and righted. The casualty report lists four dead and eight wounded. Hikukuro Omodaka is the only one who commits harakiri. The two other seconds will be ""harakiri-ed,"" if necessary, by a delegation from the Clan, on Saitos orders. All of these casualties, including Omodaka, will be declared as having died from sickness and so appearances will be preserved, and ""honor"" will be saved."

He finally takes up a gun and faces Valance in a menacing shootout.—Tony Kessen <rhkessen@cs.vu.nl> The film begins in 1910 when a successful aging U.S. senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife of twenty-five years Hallie (Vera Miles) return to the small western town Shinbone, where they met, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) a man known in the town as a good man but undistinguished.When a young local reporter presses Stoddard for an interview about why he has come to the funeral of a nobody like Doniphon, Stoddard begins a story that relates the history of the film in flashback. Stoddard tells us how when he came to the town as young newly-graduated attorney at law he was bullied by a local tough outlaw named Liberty Valence (Lee Marvin), a gunman employed by the local cattle cartel directed to keep the town in line so that the barons could monopolize the local resources to insure their beef industry.He first meets Valance when the stagecoach he is travelling in is ambushed by the outlaw and his companions.Stoddard tries to stop him from robbing a woman but he is knocked out.When Valance discovers he is a law graduate,he whips him several times,before he and his friends wander off into the night.Early the next morning,Doniphon and his friend Pompey (Woody Strode) take the unconscious Stoddard into Shinbone to rest up at Hallie's place where she runs a steakhouse.Bumbling and cowardly marshal,Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) arrives and is horrified to find out that they want him to capture Valance.He tries his best to come up with excuses about how the jurisdiction prevents him from doing anything about it,which is what the residents have come to expect from him.On one boisterous night,newspaper publisher Dutton Peabody leaves his office and runs into Appleyard who is petrified because he knows Valance is in town.Peabody goes to the restaurant for dinner,where Stoddard is helping out in the kitchen as a way of earning his keep.While he's washing the dishes,he's reading up on a law book about the marshal's jurisdiction and how he can get Valance.He finds some useful information and asks Hallie to read the good news,but she feels embarrassed as she can't read.Appleyard sneaks into the kitchen through the back door,nervously trying to keep out of Valance's way.He asks for a steak and sits down with Stoppard who tells him that he has he power to arrest Valance when he sees him,much to his dismay.Hallie asks Stoppard if he would be willing to teach her to read and he's happy to.Doniphon arrives all dressed up, with a cactus rose to see Hallie and isn't too happy to see her getting friendly with Stoddard.Pompy plants the rose for her,while Doniphon goes to sit with Peabody while he waits for his steak order.Valance and his men enter and as soon as Appleyard hears him,he rushes out of the back door.The outlaws remove three men from their table and sit down for dinner.Stoddard comes out from the kitchen with Doniphon's meal and sees them.Valance laughs at him.As Stoddard tries to ignore him and walk passed him,Valance trips him up.Doniphon tells Valance to pick his steak up.To avoid a showdown,Stoddard angrily picks it up and Valance and his men leave.Stoddard realises that Doniphon was right.A gun is the only way to deal with people like Valance.But he's disgusted that Doniphon was going to kill him over a steak and hates the idea that he fought his fight for him.Doniphon tells him Valance will be back for him at some point.He either better get a gun or get out of town.Stoddard says he's staying and he's not going to get a gun.Doniphon tells Hallie he's leaving town for a while to do some horse trading.Stoddard teaches the people in the town how to read,and about history.He explains to them about the upcoming election and how important it is.Doniphon arrives with news about Valance.He's been recruiting gunmen for the big ranchers and has killed some people.They tried to bushwhack Doniphon but he killed one of them and got away.Doniphon reckons they'll arrive in town by the day of the election.He tells Hallie to go home and be safe but she tells him that he doesn't own her.He leaves and Stoddard tells her that Doniphon is only trying to protect her.He goes off on a wagon and Peabody tells her that Stoddard has a gun that he's given him and he's been practicing with it to try and prepare for a showdown with Valance.Hallie tells Doniphon about this and he goes after him.After catching up with him,he takes him to his ranch and tells him that Hallie's his girl,and shows him the extension that he is having done on his home ready to settle down with her.Stoddard says there's nothing going on between them but Doniphon can tell she's starting to develop feelings for him.He also reckons Stoddard's bluffing about going up against Valance but Stoddard's adamant that he fully intends to.However he proves that despite practicing,he still cannot use a gun at all.Doniphon tries to teach him.He tells him to put some paint cans up on a fence and shoots them,the final one covering Stoddard in paint.Stoddard is angry at him humiliating him as Doniphon laughs.But he explains that's the kind of behaviour to expect from Valance.Stoddard punches him in the jaw and goes off.On the day of the elections,Stoddard nominates Doniphon for the first delegate but he refuses.He already has his future planned with Hallie.Doniphon nominates Stoddard.Valance arrives and threatens the townsfolk to nominate him.If they don't,he'll get hold of them when they're alone.But they still refuse to vote for him.The only people that nominate him are his two sidekicks.Stoddard gets a lot of votes but Peabody gets the most.Valance confronts Stoddard.Doniphon tries to intervene but Valance tells him he's been hiding behind his gun long enough.He orders Stoddard to either get out of town or face him in the street.If he stays and hides,he'll go and get him.As he leaves,Doniphon tells Stoddard it would be best to leave.Later that night,Peabody gets drunk in his office whilst writing the newspaper headlines.He goes off to the saloon to get some more alchohol.When he returns to his office and lights up the room,he finds Valance and his men waiting for him.They wreck his office and beat him to near death.As they go off to the saloon after firing gunshots in the street,Stoddard goes over to see Peabody.He tells Appleyard to go and tell Valance he'll be waiting for him in the street,while he goes off to get his gun from Hallie's.He fires and Valance dies. A wounded Stoddard returns to Hallie who confides that she did not want him to leave. Doniphon comes in and sees Hallie and Stoddard together and apologizes to Hallie that he did not arrive in time to help.Doniphon returns drunken to his place where he torches it and would be content to die if Pompy did not rescue him from the burning house.When Stoddard is unanimously elected to a political career so he may clear the land of other outlaws, he defers, but then Doniphon comes forth to tell him that on that fateful night Valence fell due to a shot Doniphon fired from him across the street.When Stoddards ethical issues rise and he moves to tell the world the truth, Doniphon convinces him to keep the truth a secret and take a leading role to change the ways of the old West. Doniphon tells Stoddard that Hallie is Stoddard's girl now and since he taught her how to read and write, he needs to give her something to read and write about. Stoddard goes on to a stellar career making sweeping changes in the way the land is governed and Doniphon fades away.As Stoddard finishes his story, the reporter destroys his notes and insists that the myth of the West is more important to sustain than the sterilized truth, although the truth has freed the demons Stoddard and Hallie have carried with them since their time with Doniphon.Stoddard returns to Doniphon's casket to leave with Hallie and notices a cactus rose on top of the casket.On the train ride back to the east, Stoddard asks Hallie if she would mind returning back to Shinbone to settle down and retire. Hallie says she would love to as her heart has always been there. Stoddard asks Hallie who placed the cactus rose on Doniphon's casket. Hallie says she did."
Diamond Head,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055905/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 1950s Hawaii, a bigoted and ruthless land baron, with political ambitions, bans his sister from marrying a native even though he himself has secretly impregnated a native woman. Rich Hawaiian pineapple grower and US Senatorial candidate Richard Howland tries to control everything and everyone around him, including his headstrong sister, Slone. Howland learns the hard way that money and power cannot buy love and happiness.—Marinelle K. Szenasy Hawaii, 1959. Widowed pineapple plantation owner Richard Howland, often called King for his stature in upper class Hawaiian society, is contemplating the request to run in the newfound state's first election for the US Senate, he almost guaranteed to win if he does run. That request coincides with his younger sister Sloane Howland's return from the mainland, San Francisco, where she was attending college. King and his sister-in-law Laura Beckett, who stayed on at the plantation after her sister's death, have done everything in the goal to pass the plantation on to Sloane when the time comes, especially as King's only offspring, a son, died in the same accident that killed his wife leaving King and Sloane the last in the line of Howlands. Sloane returns with news that she and her childhood friend, Paul Kahana, who was attending the same college, have decided to get married, their relationship which only recently moved from platonic friend status to lovers. King objects to the marriage, not because of Paul being unambitious which he admits, but purely on racial lines as Paul is native Hawaiian, that objection only strengthened in King's political ambition. When she was a teenager, Sloane was on the cusp of embarking on something romantic with Paul's older biracial half-brother, now Dr. Dean Kanaha, they stopping themselves before anything happened. While Paul and Dean's mother, Kapiolani Kahana, also has the same racial objection, she coming from it first hand in her first husband, Dean's father, being white, she does bless the union. Complicating matters is that King is in a secret relationship with Asian Mai Chen, who he could probably admit to himself that he loves but will never marry or consider ""family"" because of her race.—Huggo"
Carnival of Souls,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055830/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a traumatic accident, a woman becomes drawn to a mysterious abandoned carnival. Mary Henry is enjoying the day by riding around in a car with two friends. When challenged to a drag, the women accept, but are forced off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until Mary, quite some time later, amazingly emerges from the river. After recovering, Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist, only to be dogged by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old run-down pavilion. It is here that Mary must confront the personal demons of her spiritual insouciance.—Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org> A street race results in one of the cars careening off a bridge and into the muddy river below. Of the three people in that car, only Mary Henry emerges alive from the river. Mary seems desensitized to life after that incident. She escapes that town and the memory of the accident by accepting a job in another town in Utah as a church organist, despite she not being religiously minded. She vows never to return. However, on her drive to Utah, she begins to see visions of a man - almost as an apparition - who she believes is out to get her. Other strange occurrences are that she at times seems possessed, and at other times seems to be physically invisible to the world. All these occurrences make her at times repulsed by her lecherous rooming house neighbor, John Linden, while other times feeling the need for his companionship. Despite the help of a therapist, Mary believes that specifically the visions of the man have something to do with an abandoned carnival site located at the outskirts of town, the carnival site to which she is nonetheless drawn.—Huggo While driving her car with two girlfriends, the driver is challenge to a drag race and falls off a bridge over a river. When it seems that the girls have drowned and there are no survivors, Mary Henry surprisingly get's out of the water. A couple of days later, she drives to another town to work as organist in a church despite not being religious. While driving, she has visions of weird people. When she arrives, she moves into a room of the house owned by Mrs. Thomas. However Mary is haunted by spirits and is frequently drawn to a nearby abandoned carnival, where she discloses a dark secret.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil While out for a drive, three girlfriends get into a car race with two boys. As the car chase takes them down backroads, they come to a bridge. Trying to get across it, the girls car ends up crashing through the side and the car sinks into the water.Some time afterward, a search party is brought out, but after several hours, there appears to be no sign of the car. However, things take a turn for the surprising, when one of the girls, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), emerges from the water, cold and shaken. Some people ask her questions, but she does not give any answers at that time.Some time afterward, Mary gets a job as an organ player in Utah. Before she leaves, she stops by the organ factory in town, and places on their organ for them. The place she is going to has an organ made from the same factory as well. When the Factory owner requests that Mary come back some time to play for them again, she claims she will not be returning.Mary then takes off on her trip. As she nears Salt Lake City, Utah, her vision is drawn to a dark pavilion lying back a ways towards the horizon. As she glances out the passenger side window, she is shocked to see a man staring in at her! Mary turns away and looks back, but the figure is soon gone. However, Mary is shocked again when the same figure appears on the road in front of her, causing her to drive off the road. Collecting herself, Mary gets back on the road, and heads towards Salt Lake City.Mary rooms at a residence, presided over by a woman named Mrs Thomas (Frances Feist). There is another person rooming at the house, a rather slimy warehouse worker named John Linden (Sidney Berger).After putting her things in her new residence, Mary goes off to the church to meet the Minister (Art Ellison). She practices on the organ, but after some time, stops and sits by a window to contemplate. The Minister asks her if she would like to take a ride with him to an appointment. Mary also makes a request that since the appointment is outside of town, if they could drive by the pavilion she saw on the way in.The Minister agrees, and they drive up to the entrance. The Minister explains that the place is gated off to keep people out. Mary seems curious to go in, but the Minister says he won't, given that there are rules forbidding people to enter.Returning back to the apartment, Mary takes a bath, but is interrupted when John knocks on her door. He offers to buy her dinner, but she refuses. After John has left, Mary walks out and looks over the railing, only to see the man she saw before standing in the 1st floor foyer! As he walks towards the stairs, Mary returns to her room and bolts the door. Sometime afterwards, Mrs Thomas comes up with a sandwich and some coffee. When Mary inquires about the man she saw, Mrs Thomas claims she didn't see anyone on the way upstairs. Mary insists she saw someone, but the landlady claims that Mary's mind must be playing tricks on her.Mary soon after attempts to go to sleep, but her mind finds itself drifting away to the pavilion.Waking up, Mary finds a knock on the door, and John enters offering homemade coffee. As they talk, Mary then explains to John her job as being an organist for a church in town. John thinks that Mary must be a very religious girl, but she explains that she doesn't care either way, and that she plays just so she can get paid. Mary thanks him for the gesture, and then goes out to shop for clothing.Going into a Department Store, she tries on a dress, and then changes back into her own clothes. However, upon exiting the dressing room, Mary is surprised when it seems that the sound of the world has stopped around her, and nobody can hear or see her! Wandering out of the store and into a nearby park, she breathes a sigh of relief when she hears some birds chirping, and the sounds of the world seem to start up again.Going over to a drinking fountain, Mary stops to drink, but upon seeing a black suit in front of her, Mary looks up and panics! Rushing over to a nearby man, she insists that the man by the drinking fountain is the one she's been seeing...but it soon appears she was in error, even though Mary insists it was him.The man she rushed to is a Doctor. Intending to calm her down, he takes her to his office nearby, and listens to everything Mary has to say. The Doctor assumes that the appearance of this apparition to Mary may have something to do with the trauma she experienced after surviving the car crash. When pressing Mary to see if the figure resembles anyone she knows, Mary insists she's never seen the man before. Feeling that the man may have some connection to the abandoned pavilion outside of town, Mary decides to go there, cutting off the Doctor in mid-analysis.Mary soon arrives at the abandoned pavilion, and begins to walk around. Strange things happen here and there, but she soon calms as she walks around.Returning back to the house, she meets up with Joe who again offers to take her out to dinner. Mary claims she already ate, but when Joe offers to pick her up after her organ practice at the church, Mary agrees, claiming she doesn't want to be alone.Mary then goes to the church, but as she plays the organ, something strange comes over her, and she finds herself playing a strange, and eerie melody on the organ. As she plays, a vision comes to her of a group of people inside the pavilion's enormous ballroom area, dancing. Each of them resembles the man with pale skin, and dark areas around their eyes.Suddenly, the Minister's hands press down on Mary's, ending the song. The Minister is shocked at the music that Mary has chosen to play, and orders her to resign from her post. At these words, Mary quietly gathers her things and leaves.Outside, she runs into John, who eagerly takes her to a club. John keeps trying to be sociable to Mary, but she just seems distant and unable to respond, even though she claims she likes being with him.Going back to the house, John attempts to get intimate with Mary, but she does not seem to welcome any of his advances. As she goes over to her dresser with a mirror on it, John walks up behind her, but to Mary, the reflection is that of the eerie man she's seen before! Mary then yells for John to stay away from her, and John leaves, as Mary pleads that she doesn't want to be alone.The next day, the doctor whom Mary had met previously shows up. Inquiring to Mrs Thomas, she explains that Mary was moving furniture in her room around all night, and would not let her in in the morning. The Doctor claims he gave Mary advice, but Mrs Thomas claims to the Doctor that she doesn't want Mary lodging with her any longer. The Doctor then assures the landlady that Mary intends to leave soon.Sometime afterwards, Mary packs her suitcases, and quietly leaves the house, not saying a word to Mrs Thomas when she speaks to her.Mary's car gives her transmission trouble, and she ends up going to a local service station. When the station attendant asks her if she wishes to get out of the car, Mary refuses. She stays in the car as it is lifted into the air on the service station's platform. As a customer pulls in for gas, the attendance leaves Mary alone in the garage.As she waits, she hears the sound of a door open, and heavy footsteps. A hand then turns the release valve for the lift, and the car slowly lowers to the ground. Mary has the doors locked, but as she hears something that makes her back towards the passenger door, it suddenly flies open!Mary runs for her life down the street. As she does so, suddenly she finds that like in the Department Store, she has become invisible to people, as well as the sound of the world cuts off.Rushing into a bus station, she finds tries to buy a ticket, but the attendant will not listen. Suddenly, a loud speaker blares of a bus leaving from gate 9. Mary rushes from the gate and quickly rushes onto the bus...only to be met with the wide-eyes stares of the apparitions she saw dancing in the pavilion's dance hall! They smile and chase her off the bus as Mary runs for her life, calling out and pleading for someone to hear or see her!Mary returns to the park from the day before, and just like the day before, she hears birds chirping and the sounds of the world start back up again. Mary then rushes to the Doctor's office, requesting that he help her,feeling that she is really going crazy. The Doctor's chair has been turned away from her, but as it turns around, she finds the man from before sitting in it! Mary lets out a scream--and wakes from her daydream, still in her car in the garage (though the lift is now down instead of up). Mary quickly throws the car into reverse, and heads out of town, back to the pavilion.Going into the abandoned ball room, she soon finds the same apparitions she has seen in her dream (as well as on the bus). Slowly, they start to dance. Mary watches, and as the music begins to turn eerie and the beat of the organ fills her ears, she cries out and runs off, with the apparitions in pursuit. They chase her all over the pavilion grounds. Mary tries to escape but falls and lies screaming as the dead-eyed figures close around her.Sometime afterward, a search party looking for Mary finds her car at the Pavilion's gates. Searching the grounds, they find her foot prints rushing off into a sandy area, and an imprint on the ground where her body was, but no sign of her.Back in Kansas, the search party has finally recovered the car that fell into the lake. After pulling it out of the water, we see that not only are the other two girls still in the car, but so is Mary's body as well!"
The Manchurian Candidate,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056218/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An American POW in the Korean War is brainwashed as an unwitting assassin for an international Communist conspiracy. Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) is an intelligence officer in the U.S. Army. He served valiantly as a Captain in the Korean war and his Sergeant, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), even received the Medal of Honor. Marco has a major problem however: he has a recurring nightmare, one where two members of his squad were killed by Shaw. He's put on indefinite sick leave and visits Shaw in New York City. Shaw, for his part. has established himself well, despite the misgivings of his domineering mother, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (DameAngela Lansbury). She is a red-baiter, accusing anyone who disagrees with her right-wing reactionary views of being a Communist. Raymond hates her, not only for how she's treated him, but equally because of his stepfather, the ineffectual U.S. Senator John Iselin (James Gregory), who is intent on seeking higher office. When Marco learns that others in his Korean War unit have had nightmares similar to his own, he realizes that something happened to all of them in Korea, and that Raymond Shaw is the focal point.—garykmcd/Robert Sieger Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is only one of seventy-seven U.S. military men who arrive back from the Korean War awarded the Medal of Honor. Raymond's controlling and ambitious mother, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Dame Angela Lansbury), wants to capitalize on Raymond's name in the re-election bid of her husband, Raymond's stepfather, Republican Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory), which does not sit well with Raymond, who despises both of them. Despite John being largely seen as being a buffoon, he has garnered a modicum of political success largely due to his anti-Communist rhetoric. The Medal of Honor was the result of Raymond saving nine members of his army battalion, including his commanding officer Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra), in what was a multi-day battle behind enemy lines. After the war, Raymond leaves the Army to start a job in New York City as the confidential assistant to well-respected political journalist Holborn Gaines (Lloyd Corrigan), who has never written a nice thing about the Iselins. Bennett Marco (now reassigned to a post in Washington, D.C.), who nominated Raymond for the award, suffers from a recurring nightmare, where he, the nine other men, plus two who never made it out of the battle, are attending what is on the surface an innocuous New Jersey women's gardening club meeting, but which he can feel has sinister undertones related to Raymond. What makes the nightmare more disturbing is that, in reality, he is compelled to say only the nicest things about Raymond whenever asked, which he knows he doesn't truly believe. If asked in return, Raymond would corroborate that he did not get along with any of the men, including Bennett, who all disliked him. Raymond would in fact admit that he is an unlovable person, he only having loved and been loved once in his life, to Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), the daughter of Democratic Senator Thomas Jordan (John McGiver). It was a relationship that Eleanor Iselin forced her son to break off, as she could not tolerate Raymond being with the daughter of a man who she considered a Communist. What Bennett is unaware of, is that at least one of the other eight survivors, with whom he has not kept in contact after returning to the States, has a similar version of the same nightmare. Bennett eventually decides that the one person who can best help him figure out the source of the nightmare is Raymond. After witnessing some unusual behavior in Raymond, Bennett Marco knows that something is not right and discovers an unprecedented conspiracy against the United States.—Huggo/Robert Sieger After Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) returns from the Korean War as a decorated hero, the surviving members of his platoon can't really remember the actions with which he is credited, having done in order to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Two of the soldiers start having recurring nightmares, and one of them decides to investigate Raymond's current activities. What dark and sinister secrets are being withheld by or from the Government and the Army?—Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com>/ Robert Sieger <Rms125a@hotmail.com> Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is an insufferable man, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, for saving the lives of the men in his unit while in South Korea. When he returns, he distances himself from his domineering mother, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Dame Angela Lansbury). His Commanding Officer Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has been having nightmares that lead him to believe that the circumstances that led to Raymond getting the medal are not true. While his superiors don't think he knows what he is talking about, they decide to is send him on leave. And when he goes to visit Raymond, he is greeted by Raymond's new valet, who opens the door, and who he instinctively attacks. The valet had served with them, but Marco instinctively believes that he actually was a fifth columnist plant who betrayed the platoon in South Korea. A brutal fight between the two men breaks out, which Marco ultimately wins. Marco is arrested but the brass help get him released as the valet obviously has no intention of pressing charges. Marco goes to see Raymond, who tells him that another man from their unit, Allen Melvin (James Edwards), wrote to him describing the same nightmare Marco has been having. Marco has the man checked out and both of their recollections are so similar that Marco's superiors agree something is wrong and give Marco the resources to investigate on his own.—rcs0411@yahoo.com In 1952 during the Korean War, the Soviets capture an American platoon and take them to Manchuria in Communist China. After the war, the soldiers return to the United States, and Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is credited with saving their lives in combat. Upon the recommendation of the platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra), Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for his supposed actions. In addition, when asked to describe him, Marco and the other soldiers automatically respond, ""Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life."" Deep down, however, they know something is wrong. As Marco puts it: ""It isn't as if Raymond is hard to like. He's impossible to like!""Marco who has since been promoted to Major suffers from a recurring nightmare in which a hypnotized Shaw strangles one of his fellow soldiers, and shoots another, killing both before the assembled military brass of communist nations, during a practical demonstration of a brainwashing technique. (Raymond and his platoon have been hypnotized into believing that the Korean military brass are a bunch of harmless old American ladies from a garden club.)Marco wants to investigate, but receives no support from Army Intelligence as he has no proof. However, Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon, Allen Melvin (James Edwards), has had the same nightmare. When Melvin and Marco separately identify some of the men in the dream as leading figures in communist governments, Army Intelligence decides that this is too much of a coincidence and agrees to help Marco investigate.Shaw's mother, Mrs. Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury), is the driving force behind her husband, Shaw's step-father, Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory), a bombastic demagogue in the style of Joseph McCarthy, who is dismissed by most people as a fool. Shaw hates them both, especially his domineering mother. Senator Iselin's political stature is established when (per his wife's orders) he interrupts a televised press conference given by the Secretary of Defense, accusing him of knowing that some 207 Defense Department employees are ""card carrying"" Communists. This provokes the expected chaos and shock among journalists and an enraged reaction from the Secretary.Unknown to everyone including Raymond, the Iselins (or possibly only Mrs. Iselin) are actually Stalinist agents with a plan intended to take them all the way to the White House. His mother is actually the American ""operative"" for whom Raymond is to effect the operation's final step. Raymond was conditioned in Manchuria to be an unwitting assassin whose actions are triggered by a Queen of Diamonds playing card. When he sees it, he will obey the next suggestion or order given to him by anyone. When given instructions to kill selected targets, he must also kill any witnesses and never remember his actions, making him the perfect assassin as he can never feel fear or guilt. It is revealed that Shaw's heroism was a false memory implanted in the platoon by the Communists in Manchuria, and that they were covertly returned to the American lines only after their conditioning was completed. The actions for which Shaw was awarded his Medal of Honor never took place.Raymond briefly finds happiness when he rekindles a youthful romance with Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), the daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan (John McGiver), one of his stepfather's political rivals. Raymond had previously courted Jocelyn in order to get at his parents in a Romeo and Juliet-style romance, but they then genuinely fell in love, both she and her father being the nearest thing Raymond has ever had to having friends. Mrs. Iselin broke up the relationship for obvious political reasons, but now facilitates the couple's reunion as part of her scheme to garner the support of Senator Jordan for her husband's own sudden vice presidential bid.Jocelyn, wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume outfit, inadvertently hypnotizes Raymond at a costume party thrown by the Iselins at their Long Island home and the couple elopes. Although tolerant of the match, Senator Jordan makes it clear to Mrs. Iselin that he will move for her husband's impeachment if he makes any attempt to seek the vice-presidential nomination. Raymond's conditioning is then triggered by his mother and he is sent to assassinate Jordan. Jocelyn happens upon the scene and is also shot dead as a witness to the event. Raymond has no knowledge of his actions and is genuinely grief-stricken when he learns of the murders.In the course of Marco's investigation, he discovers the role of the Queen of Diamonds card in putting Raymond into the hypnotic state for his assignments. Marco meets Raymond and, using a deck composed entirely of Queen of Diamonds, gets the full story and orders Raymond to break the linkages between himself and the card forever and to disobey any further subsequent orders from his controllers. Unaware of this, Mrs. Iselin primes her son to assassinate their party's presidential candidate at the nomination convention so that Senator Iselin, as the vice-presidential candidate, will become the presidential candidate by default and give an inflammatory anti-Communist speech (actually written by the Communists themselves). This will cause mass hysteria that will get Iselin, the real ""Manchurian candidate"", elected and justify such emergency powers that, in Mrs. Iselin's words, ""will make martial law seem like anarchy"". She condescendingly tells her son that, although he may never fully understand, she did not know it would be her son whom the Communists selected as the assassin, apparently because they believed it would solidify their own hold over her. Furious, she vows that once in power she will ""grind them into the dirt"". She proceeds to give the ostensibly ""hypnotized"" Raymond a decidedly non-maternal kiss.Marco's attempt to free Raymond appears to have failed. Raymond enters the convention hall disguised as a Catholic priest and takes up a position to carry out the assassination as he was instructed, using a rifle with a scope. Marco and his supervisor, Colonel Milt (Douglas Henderson), arrive at the convention to stop him. As the Presidential nominee (Robert Riordan) makes his speech, Raymond instead shoots his stepfather and mother dead. He then commits suicide in front of Marco while wearing his undeserved Medal of Honor."

He is not taken into custody, at this stage he to continue with his day-to-day routine, with his trips to the interrogation commission, which will determine his guilt or innocence, to be the only deviation from his routine. Initially, he believes his company may have something to do with the charge as the three men are accompanied by three of his coworkers. He also initially believes it may have something to do with his rooming house neighbor, exotic nightclub dancer Miss Burstner, as the inspector came through Miss Burstner's room and his three coworkers are rummaging through her room.

Jules is left to deal with the ashes of his friends.IN DEPTH ANALYSIS: By aditya10-828-343654Scene 1: The lines which sum up the movieYou said ''l love you!''and l said ''Stay!''l nearly said ''Take me!''but you said ''Go away!'' (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)The above lines introduce the audience to the movie, immediately followed by the opening credits. The above lines have a very deep meaning, which are manifested as the movie proceeds. Eventually, it can be seen that these have actually summed up the entire film.The credits follow, which show shots of the main male leads Jules, Jim and Catherine. For our knowledge the main leads are played by:
Oskar Werner as Jules
Henri Serre as Jim
Jeanne Moreau as Catherine
Importantly, Michel Subor as the NarratorA first time viewer may not make much sense of the opening dialogs, but, the credits are a treat to watch in itself. There are wide-angled shots of Jules and Jim wiling away their time together, and having fun everywhere. Most scenes here show them having a good time and indulged in activities where they are involved together, like a mock fight or Jules lunging on to Jim.
The lovable face of Jeanne Moreau is shown in one of the shots. The scene also introduces us to the supporting cast like Albert and Sabine who have some role to play in the coming events.A couple of interesting observations can be made here:
1.	The film actually breaks certain unwritten rules and tries to sum up the story with its opening shot.
2.	Like a true path-breaking movie representing the French New Wave era, the credits are filled with images and clips of the actors, involved in interesting activities, something which we have grown to watching at the fag end, in case of other movies. This is a unique way of introducing the characters beyond their screen names.
3.	Also, the entire credit sequence is shot in bright lights, and depicts a very warm and positive mood, in stark contrast to what unfolds in the later scenes.
All in all, the scene succeeds in building the right mood and setting a tone for the rest of the film.Scene 2: Bonding and FlirtingThe story begins from this scene, and as against the traditional way of introducing each character separately, the movie starts with both Jules and Jim together in the first scene. The lack of history about the male leads is compensated by a sound narration in the background. The entire scene is, in fact, narrated and talks about how the duo meet. Jim actually helps Jules in getting an entry to a ballet performance. As they interact, a friendship blooms, and they are now seen spending most of their time together. Of course, they are chasing girls, with Jim being more successful.
The scene towards the end, clearly outlines the chemistry between them. More importantly, it portrays two different characters Jim, as a more convincing and stable guy for relationships as against Jules, who is shy and not the one to create a lasting impression on women.
Another notable point is the common interests of the duo in literature, indifference to money and also in women (they go for a threesome as mentioned).Scene 3: The Hitch-HikerThe scene introduces the first major woman character in the film Teresa (enacted seamlessly by Marie Dubois) Against all accusations of Truffaut showing shades of misogyny, this character actually exudes waves of free living. Teresa is a free radical, and beyond her daylight garb of an anarchist (a somewhat harsh term for a girl who paints the walls of Paris with sarcastic remarks on the incumbent), she actually searches a new shelter (read man) every night. On one such night, she is on a running spree from her accomplice (in painting walls), and meets Jules and Jim. There is an instant chemistry thanks to her cheerful presence. She is happy to meet Jim and Jules, to which Jim corrects with a Jules et Jim. Thus, comes a recall of the movie title in a way the characters would like to put it. The scene also informs of Jim dating Gilberta, making Jules the man to take Teresa to his house.
The scene at the house begins with Jules resetting the hourglass and describing it as better than a clock. The entire dialog by Jules can be interpreted metaphorically as his preference to a quiet life or relationship compared to a constant ticking. The scene reinforces the sweet nature of Jules, and is followed by a spectacular performance by Teresa who smokes the cigarette like a steam engine and hops around the room. The scene is really enlightening and on hindsight one can say, its the story of her life, where although she can move places and call it freedom, but, it is always bound by certain boundaries like the tracks of a steam locomotive.Scene 4: The elusive Lady LuckThe opening shot shapes up the character of Jim as a sorted person. True, he is dating a girl, but, he leaves for the day even after her insistence, because, he firmly believes in letting the relationship thrive over time before going for something like a Live-in with Gilberta.
The next shot is of Jules, Jim and Teresa at an eating table, where Teresa suddenly deserts their company to get in conversation with another man. Her style is the same as Jules experienced the other night and something which disappoints Jules again. Jim does console him, only to watch Jules reminiscing his past girlfriends, and showing their photographs. Jules also chalks out a face on the table of his past love, which Jim attempts to buy from the hotel owner. This goes to show the camaraderie between the two and the way, they attach importance to each others emotions.
A clear contrast can be seen here between Jules and Jim wrt relationships. Jules is sweet, shy and somehow very obvious in his keenness to have partners, whereas, Jim is more thoughtful, patient and never outrightly judgmental for a girl, as in the case of Gilberta.
Notably, Teresa is the first instance of a free spirit, and her tendency to move on from staying at one place, to another every night is not just about finding a new shelter every night, but, is more about referring to the aspiration of moving on from one partner to another, and leading life on terms. Maybe, she doesnt influence the society much as an activist of anarchy, but, she does have elements of anarchy in her own life.Scene 5: Finding the purpose of their livesIts a new day, when the duo meet Jules friend Albert. Albert is showing them a slideshow of pictures of different statues. The reason why they go for this isnt known. The description here by Jules for Albert is very interesting He knows all thosewho'll be famous in years (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)
These lines can double up to also mean that Albert is the person who now knows Jules and Jim well, and these are the characters who are famous even today. Probably, a far-fetched idea, but, these lines exude the directors confidence in the plot, knowing already that these characters will become evergreen in the memories of the viewer in times to come.
Albert takes them through many photographs of statues he had clicked in different places, and suddenly Jules and Jim are struck by the Eureka moment. Jim requests for a particular photo to be seen again.
This was the photo of a not-so-smooth finish sculpture of a woman with a very calm and enlightening smile. The peace this photo exuded, made Jules and Jim get hooked to it, and they pay a visit to the actual sculpture, which was displayed in an open-air museum at an Adriatic island. The scene enters into narration mode, and the soothing voice of Subor, does add intensity to the scene. The scene has our duo dressed alike, which goes to show either their homoerotic feelings for each other, which might sound clichéd, or rather their simple thought process of having fallen for the same smile. Jules and Jim spend the entire day sitting beside the statue and even after returning they seem to have a scarcity of words for what they had witnessed.
They instantly decided that such a smile was rare, and if they ever found a woman with one, they would pursue it. These last lines mean very simply that if such a woman were to be found, both of them would definitely try to love her, which probably forms a backdrop for the rest of the movie, where they end up loving the same woman.Scene 6: Think of the Angel, and you be blessed with onePerhaps, one of the most critical scenes in the movie.
It starts with Jules and Jim practising in a gym, when, Jim narrates excerpts from a book that he is writing. Autobiographical in nature, the novel is about Jim and Jules as Jack and Julian. It descirbes their friendship as queer, which in todays times is considered a derogatory way of addressing homosexuals. Jim actually cites these considering the time the duo spend together, and the concern and love they have for each other. Jules, also likes the work and offers to translate the same in German.
This is the scene where the movie has tried to show Jules and Jim in the light of being a couple, but, in a very subtle manner. So, the viewer can either assume this to be true considering that direct representation of a same sex relationship in those days would have been a taboo.
Else, some critics consider this argument far-fetched and that the relationship is merely platonic.
Any which way, one cannot stop wondering about this, also considering that this movie is based on a novel by Henri-Pierre Roche who was known to have experienced some relationship of this kind.
A better way of explaining this is that Jim is writing an autobiographical novel, which can be a tribute to Roche, and whether or not Truffaut wishes to clarify on the relationship of Jules and Jim, we already now from the life of Roche, that there were homoerotic feelings between him and his friend, which inspired his autobiographical novel.
Anyway, the film so far keep us under the impression of the duo being a couple, in spite of their following the opposite sex.
This is followed by a shower sequence, where Jules talks about 3 girls (French, Belgian and Dutch), invited for dinner.
This is where, we witness the next from the appearance of Catherine (couldnt have been a better choice than Jeanne Moreau).
The entire sequence has a very angelic feel to it, with Catherine shown to be walking down the stairs, almost like an angel, something which is a common feature in modern day Bollywood movies, where the entry sequence of the female protagonist is dramatized to the extent of showing her as the Goddess of beauty and poise.
Jules and Jim witness a near dream Catherine is THE one. The woman they would pursue, because she has that enigmatic smile.
Jules suggests no formalities during the party, and a touching of toes against the customary linking of arms. Probably, abolishing usage of formal addresses for each other is supposed to make the guest be at comfort with the entire party.
The linking of toes is a contrast of sorts. The first impression it gives to the audience is that Jules is shying away, Jim is eager and Catherine is undecided. Further analysis of scenes will tell us if this is how the plot will unfold.Scene 7: The race beginsJules was head on heels after the coveted smile and the Lady herself. Catherine had an aura about herself, and Jules wasted no time in pursuing his dream girl.
For almost a month, Jules was seeing Catherine, and used to meet Jim at the gym.
Just as a logical extension to their friendship, Jim is invited by Jules to meet Catherine, who is eager to meet Jim, having heard a lot from Jules.
Jules wants Jim to meet her, but, stay away from seeing her the other way.
They meet pretty formally, and the plan is of an outing. Truffauts brilliance comes out in this scene as he blasts the stigma against a woman venturing out with two men.
To overcome this situation, Catherine puts up a moustache, lights a cigar and leaves with the duo. His scene holds special importance, considering how a sweet friendship with two men, still needs to be concealed from the society. Truly, one can connect with such a situation around us, when a guy roaming about with two girls is a stud and a girl doing the same in the converse is a slut.
Catherine finds it a lot more fun to see a man referring to her as Sir, and taking help to light his smoke. This scene sends the message that with a certain get-up, a woman can find her way in a patriarchal society. On the other hand, from Catherines perspective it is the sense of freedom from such social stigmas, and that a certain way an attitude of life can actually make men bow before you.
Jules and Jim are really enjoying this outing, wondering if tit is a dream or is it actually raining. More so, each of them is captivated by the lady, and are simply following her.
The very next scene is even more remarkable, where the trio plan to race on a bridge, and Catherine takes a false start before the count ends to win the race. Although she cheated, she makes a point with how just having an advantage initially, males dominated the society, and given an opportunity women can be more than an equal. It also symbolises the essence of the entire film, where pursuing the same woman with that enigmatic smile is the purpose of the lives of Jules and Jim. In fact, this scene beautifully captures all these aspects together, and similar to the opening dialogues of the film, it actually captures the gist of the whole film.
After the race, Jules talks to Jim about Catherines background importantly mentioning that she teaches Shakespeare. Well, this takes us back to the scene with Teresa and the duo, where Jules was talking about Shakespeare. Clearly, love for Jules would mean those enigmatic smiles followed by a Shakaespearean connect.
The scene ends with Jim agreeing to pick up Catherin from her house for the station. This is, as the trio would be travelling some place the next day. It cannot be known, the reason why Catherine asked for Jim to do the honors and not her date Jules.Scene 8: Jimmy meJim arrives at Catherines place, and it unusual pack-up for her, when she does an unusual thing. She starts burning many letters, and tells Jim that she is burning lies. She obviously is heart-broken with some past relationships, and thinks its best to flush them out of her memory lane before leaving for the trip.
Her gown catches fire in the process, and Jim helps her out. The previous frame shows her frock quite away from the fire, but, it catches fire in the very next instant. This goes to show probably, about future possibilities of Cats misdemeanours which will be cleaned up by Jim. Although, a very ridiculous thought, this is how the erstwhile society would have perceived the character of Catherine and the reaction of Jim throughout the movie.
Cat is also seen packing a bottle of sulphuric acid with her. She keeps it to punish men who lie. The aggressive heart burnt side of Cat comes out in the open. Jim persuades her to drain out the same, and, eventually the duo leave for the station.Scene 9: Threes a crowd!The trio rent a house somewhere far way from Paris on a coast. After a good nights sleep, they leave for the beach. They go on a random scavenger hunt and find cigarette butts and bottles, left by past travellers. Just, when Catherine utters I think we are lost, is when Jules discusses with Jim about planning to marry Catherine. I think the connect is signifying the lack of clarity in the relationships the tri share with each other.
Jim, at this point believes that Catherine is not meant to be a doting wife, who would be content leading a life with her husband and children. He describes her as above the earthly laws and an apparition. Clearly, this is a contrast as Catherine, as a woman is definitely one of a kind, who is like a free radical, whereas as Jules and Jim are more like men bound by the patriarchal thinking of the society.
Jules adamant for a frank opinion from Jim, which is what goes to show how enamored Jules is with the lady, but, how at the back of their minds both Jules and Jim know the eccentricity of Catherine is boundless.
All in all, society teaches us to seek stability from a relationship, whereas, Cat believes in the personal freedom and unpredictability that should guide here relationships.
Catherine also talks about the thoughts from a German book, where the lines say what Catherine really believes in -The sky we see...is a bubble no bigger than thisWe walk with our headspointed at the centerWhat's beyond the crust?Who knows? That's not a questionfor gentlemen to answer (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)
These lines clearly outline Catherines thinking of life. The whole idea of these lines is how the society has made us into believing into its established rules, and we keep coming back to it, never daring to think, if something beyond all this is possible too.
A few shots back, Jim had conveyed similar thoughts about Catherine.
The entire scene makes us know a lot more about Catherine, and also wonder as to who understands her better Jules or rather Jim?The scene ends with Jules reminding Cat of his proposition of marriage and requests for an answer by the next day.
Jules and Jim are now shown playing Dominos and are quite engrossed in the game with each other. So much so, that they almost ignore the presence of Catherine. Another instance of her aggressive nature emerges, as she attempts to draw attention to her by narrating tales weird and funny.
First, she recounts her childhood fantasy of meeting Napolean in a lift and getting pregnant with his child. Interestingly, the original book describes this as a dream of Catherine. This tells us something about her nature. She then recites a pretty sad joke, and then laughs about it. She wants someone to scratch her back for her, to which Jules responds with a funny one liner. Cat walks to him and slaps him, to which they all have a hearty laugh. To think about this, it is a moment showing how Catherine would rather live every moment of life in free will, and being spontaneous and how Jules and Jim would play a reactive role here.
Catherine actually admits of never having laughed like this before, and the fluent actress Jeanne Moreau comes up with sad faces to describe herself before meeting the duo.Well, she believes those those are past her, and now she is blissful. It rains the next day, and Cat wishes to go back to Paris. The scene really shows here capriciousness and spontaneity of taking decisions, and also of how Jim and Jules flow suit, without a reaction at all.
It is one thing to be a free bird in a patriarchal society, and a complete elevation to have people like Jim and Jules with you who aid you in leading that ideal life.
The scene ends, and our trio are now back in Paris.Scene 10: The leap of fate'Jim has just signed with his publisher, and as a celebration comes to Jules and Cat with gifts. He presents a beautiful Picasso work to the duo, and gifts a little hand (a stick) to Cat for scratching her back. A small gesture indicative of the previous scene at the island. Jim also has tickets for a Swedish play at night. The scene moves on to the inauguration of a bed for Jules, meant to be for the couple, and communicating the joys of being settled together.
The next frame moves on to the finish of play, and the trio discussing it on the way back. This is actually a quality of the film, where the story moves on very quickly from on frame to another, without bothering for the usual slower shots, and going into details which can at best link the story, but, play no role in talking about the main theme. Truffaut has taken maximum care about managing maximum footage with the protagonists. Anyway, we now find the trio discussing the movie on the way back. The play was about a woman, who is as free-spirited as Cat herself. No wonder, she liked the character a lot. Jim, on the other hand, found the play pretty divergent, and didnt agree for the usage of vice to justify virtue.
Discussing the play, really, brings out the male stigma about importance attached to virginity of a woman, which in fact, is a way to judge her dignity. The plot of the play, was about an impotent man (with a homo brother) all usual social taboos. Hence, Jim and Jules were worried more about the virginity of his wife, rather than her take on life. Jules enters the debate and advocates for the fidelity of a wife. He believes fidelity is secondary for men, and that as written in previous scriptures, thoughts advocated by Baudelaire all point towards the bitchiness of women, and Jules utters many more words against womanhood in general. Catherine, obviously takes offence to these remarks, and more so because wrt her life, she really believes and associates with the protagonist of the play. Jim, probably is sane enough to realise this and doesnt seem to support Jules; ranting against women.
This is perhaps a very dominant feature in Truffauts movies. The message he wants to send with Cats character is resonated through other female characters of the movie too like Teresa and this protagonist of the Swedish play. Catherine is not the one to let it go, and she decides to protest against Jules remarks. She believes in making a statement and walks ahead and suddenly jumps into the Seine river.
About the shot taken, it involved usage of two cameras (to capture her fall realistically and interestingly, as the body double was too high before the scene, Jeanne Moreau herself enacted this shot).
Subors voice over takes over the scene and rightly so, as the act of Catherine is too amazing to be wasted with dialogues.
Jules is shell shocked, Catherine wears the smile of a victorious general, and Jim, on the other hand is filled with admiration for the lady. So far, Jules is the one who has been clear with his love for Catherine, whilst Jim has been a secret admirer. He actually painted the jump of at in his mind, and imagined diving into the river and saving her. Its a way of enacting in the mind, something which cannot be done actually, considering she was Jules.
The trio take a cab back home, and Cat asks Jim for a small meeting the next day. This is supposedly to take his opinion on their marriage. Jim agrees and walks back after what can easily be an eventful day, when they witnessed the lady of their dreams in her fullest form.Scene 11: The mis(s)led rendezvousJim arrives at the café at 7:10 as decided, only about 10 minutes late. The deliberate delay can be described as a mentality of not being present at a meet before the woman. There is a small dialogue of some other customer, whilst Jim is shown immersed in rounds of coffee and smoking. This other customer is the actor Jean-Louis Richard, ex of Jeanne Moreau, speaking like a true heart burnt soul. Audience of that era would have connected with this short sequence more, knowing about the divorced couple.Catherine never does arrive at the café, and one thing can be said about this. Maybe, Jim would always have asked Catherine to stay away from the relationship. He was the one who read her very well, and knew that Jules cannot handle her as a wife. He was sure of Cat being a free spirit, and someone not suited enough for men of a patriarchal society. Maybe, Catherine guessed Jims opinion too, and probably gave the meeting a miss. For some reason, Jim actually missed her.
The next scene is a telephonic conversation between Jules and Jim, where Jules talks about Cats approval and their marriage plans. He says, Cat arrived at the café, but pretty late. Not much is said about this missed rendezvous. The friends talk on phone, not knowing that it will be sometime before they meet again, with the First World War beginning, and France and Germany coming at loggerheads. Interestingly, when Jim makes fun of Jules French and his Austrian accent, Jules recites a few lines, which seem like the words of a general for his forces to eliminate the enemy. Little do they know, that this will be an event in their lives pretty soon.Scene 12: Love proposes, war disposesThe war footage is shown from the archives, and is deliberately a shortened clip, in true Truffaut style of not deviating away from the premise of the film. As usual it shows devastation, depicts hideousness and the difference in war and peace.
Jeanne Moreau has quoted in an interview:
Fiction is as valid as reality, only better.
A true summation of how war is to the affected, and to those who experience it only as news or through virtual games.
The scene also shows Jims longing for a furlough, which never comes. What comes regularly is packages from Gilberta. Gilberta still is the epitome of an ideal woman prescribed by the society. Jim does get a chance to be in Paris for a week and in meeting with Gilberta, they discuss a possible marriage.
Gilberta does understand Jim, and doesnt force for a marriage. They think about growing old together, something, which signifies a live-in relationship, and not the whirlwind. Jim is worried about the chance happening of meeting Jules at the front, something which will be the worst scenario of having to kill your best pal.Scene 13: Jule(s) of thoughtJules keep writing to Catherine. He pens down his thoughts for her, not knowing if these letters could ever be posted. His feelings for Cat are at best sexual, and also about concerns for the soon to be born. His relationship appears more transactional.
Knowing Catherine, it is surprising that Jules still considers her as the socially prescribed woman.
Anyway, Jules is too happy to be posted on the Russian front. Although dangerous, he prefers it any day to killing Jim, had they met on the French front.
Finally, the war clouds subside and Jules and Jim are able to correspond through letters again. Jim expresses his desire to marry too, and Jules invites him to his location (somewhere along the Rhine river), to witness the married life and judge for himself.
Jim takes this as an opportunity, and travels to other places on his way to witness the fall-outs of the war. He witnesses mass graves, and the way war has changed demographics for ever. He also writes articles on these for a Parisian daily.
Jules, on the other hand is leading a married life and they have a daughter Sabine.Scene 14: What lies beneathCatherine has come with Sabine to receive Jim. Her dressing makes Jim think, if she is compensating for the miss at the café. They walk through the pines and meadows and reach their chalet. Jim and Jules finally meet after what seemed like eternity.
They inquire about the others and exchange hugs. They retort of each one not having changed much.
In this scene, the music suddenly changes to a more melancholy one, something which is not present in the rest of the film. It signifies of a possible twist, and something really unprecedented is waiting to happen.
The rest of the scene is about a lunch, some chatting about each others lives and taking Jim around the house.
Jules is currently scripting for a novel on dragon flies. He has taken a liking to insects and plants, and even quit smoking. Not much happens in the scene anyway, and the usual chemistry between Jim and Jules is absent. All in all, the scene is more of a context setting for the rest of Jims stay and we can only guess, as to what will be unearthed later.Scene 15: She loves me, She loves me notJim was supposed to be living at a house close to their chalet. In his conversations with Jules, he figured something wrong in their relationship. At night, he sits with Jim in his room, and tell it all. He describes how Catherine is a good wife and a mother, but, is too prone to getting off with a monotonous life. Jim is surprised, but Jules goes on with her past escapades, and her leaving home for about six months. Then, there is the return of Albert, who is recovering in a nearby village and his love for Catherine. He has fallen for her, wishes to marry her and take care of Sabine.
Jules has slowly begun to accept the fact, that he isnt the one for Catherine and is preparing himself for leaving her. Jim, on the other hand, feels that Jules Buddhist monkish personality will never let Cat leave him completely.
Although, the cat is definitely out of the bag, and Jim probably had figured it this way long back. The scene ends, on a dark night, and the next shot of twilight is also full of dark shades, showing Truffauts way of expressing the mood through nature.Scene 16: Cat(ch) me if you canJim wakes up to a dawn, which he knows will rule the days to come with its foggy darkness. Jim spends time thinking of Jules revelations, and believes that Jules is wrong. He knopws Jules in and out, and also for a fact, that his sweetness isnt enough for Cat. He appreciates Jules frankness and soft stand on the near separation wth Cat.
Really, it is the persistent feeling of Jules, that he is not the right man for Cat, that is causing these troubles. Jules still is a believer of the one-woman man and vice-versa concept, and this is what is stifling his relationship with Cat.
On the other hand, Cat is a woman, who would leap into relationships just like she had jumped into the seine, and its part of her nature to be spontaneous about partners.
On a particular night, Cat wishes to have a conversation with Jim.
In her typical style, she asks him to pursue her, and they go into the woods.
The conversation starts with a tell-all tale from Jim, where the movie so far is recounted. Jim confesses to missing Cat at the café.
He also feels no particular resentment towards Cat, at least not more than Jules himself.
Cat now gives her side of the story. She believes Jules is a sweetheart, but, only so much to it. The traits of Jules which she found attractive like his vulnerability, and hoped to heal them with her love, is what she found out were inseparable from Jules. Catherine as a woman, hates a status quo in a relationship, and couldnt stand the marriage for log. She also describes her escapades, and believes its always important to always settle the scores before starting it afresh. All this goes on, and Jim can only listen to what Catherine as a woman, is always likely to do. She is the real woman and will always have her bit to do in a relationship. She believes, her part with Jules is over, and they can never be together.
The entire conversation lasts till dawn, and the dim light sequence only emphasizes on the phase of life each character is going through.
The scene ends with Jim left thinking, if Catherine was actually hitting on him or was it just what he really wanted.Scene 17: Loves never blind, lovers areAlbert pays a visit to the household. They discuss like old friends on reunion. Truffauts portrayal might baffle many, but its true that there cannot be the expected fireworks between Jules and Albert, now that Jules has accepted his fate.
Hey discuss war, and Jim recounts the story of a soldier, who pursued his individual battle alongside the war. So much so, that he literally ived the process of love, love making and marriage through letters, and did it well.
Just to say, that a one-way communication in a relationship, can always survive, and probably it is the staying together and reacting to each other part that makes an actual relationship, seem like a corpse on the shoulders. This is also true with Jules, who had a great life with Catherine, when they corresponded through letters. Truffaut emphasizes the importance of an epistolic relationship, and how it actually aids in keeping the two sides happy. Jims narration of this story is actually a tribute to Apollinnair.
The scene ends, with Cat and Albert taking leave for practising on a song. I believe, here Jeanne Moreaus views are relevant, when she says:
A triangular relationship is never fusional. It works because each of them is like a pole, absorbed into oneself, and seeking something from each partner. Here, is an example of a love triangle, not for the common love, but, also a lot of love for each other as well.Scene 18: Even apart, we often meet againThis scene is where a beautiful song is played. Sung by Catherine, and strings strummed by albert, it beautifully describes, the initial loves bonding between Cat and Jules, and how it all went haywire. But, that want to be the end, and the couple gather their lives and live them on a new plane. It does seem like, a message from Cat to Jules. The song is meant to be sung by a man, and it appears beautiful, when certain lines arent translated, but, simply recited, adding to the beautiful mood created in the room.
It is obligatory to quote this beautiful song, just for the simple way in which it describes the relationships from a writers point of viewShe had rings on every finger Bracelets on her wristsAnd she sang with a voice
Which bewitched meWe met with a kiss
A hit - then a misslt wasn't all bliss, but we started.
Then we went our own waysWe each went back
into the hustle and bustle of lifel saw her again one night
lt's been such a long time... (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)Scene 19: A magnet for all polesThe first few lines of this scene describe Catherine as a different person for each of Jules, Jim and Albert.
This actually means, that cat is seeking a different level of relationship with each of them. She is unable to find all of friendship, love and sensual needs from one man. So, she goes out to seek each of these desires with a different partner, and is absolutely justified considering that she truly believes in living life on her own terms.
The shot of the entire family with Jim and Albert cycling across the road was a new method then. Truffaut can be credited to have creatively captured the moving image from an approaching cyclists point of view, by the camera itself placed on another cycle.
This is followed by a scene describing the newly formed affinity between Jim and Catherine. They talk about it in a room, and exchange their views on it. Jim is slightly hesitant, although he already knows he loves Cat, whereas, Cat is more about taking the plunge, being an adventurous woman that she is.
I can only describe this as a metaphorical hypothetical question and attempt to answer it too Is the contrast between the film and life between time, something that is painful and wont last?
An instant is powerful, but, it cant last. And love, is caught between the two.
Jules feels that Cat is full of desires and curiosity. The free life of cat is not an enigma, its her way of living, just that it is cruel to others.
Then, comes the scene where the two get close just below the chalet, and Jules witnesses it above.
Noises were generated in many circles, about a husband being a silent observer to his wifes liberties. But, this is about approving to the whims of Cat, and probably the last attempt in having her around, though painfully with his best pal. They discuss the exchange of a book Elected Affinties which sums up the preferences Catherine has and the level of relationship she wishes to have with different men.Scene 20: A new waveIn this scene, Jules calls up Jim for the book, but it is more for convincing him to marry Catherine.
The reason, presumably is that he knows he cant hold on to the sand that is Cat, and yet, he wants her to be preserved in a way or another. He finds it best for Jim to marry her, and start it all afresh.
Now is time for Jim to movie in. Cat shows him the room, and begins a scene of love-making.
Truffaut disliked intimate love scenes and instead focuses more on shadows and the gestures of pulling the hair, to describe the passionate moments.
With the new relationship canvas drawn, Jules also warns Jim of Cat and also from himself.
The entire romantic angles, somehow now seem like vultures hovering over threateningly and seem more destructive.
Then, comes a day when Catherine indulges with Jules, seduces him. The entire seen is like a game that Cat plays and can be viewed as a womans desire to rape a man. Rape is simply not physical, but, also about controlling the opposite during the act, and Cat as it appears is controlling the entire act.
Really, she herself said, You only truly love once, but happens to fall in love again and again. It shouldnt be viewed from the scope of morality, but from the spectacles of following ones desires and the not the rules.
Its better to be imposing yourself, rather than being imposed upon by some obsolete rules of the society.Scene 21: What goes around.comes aroundThe scene is of the trio going for a walk around a misty lake surrounded by a valley. They seem to be in peace, and try skipping stones on the water.
This scene without dialogs is signifying the dark haze gathering around the relationship of Jim and Catherine, especially after her seduction attempt on Jules.
With the darker shades, and a not so happy looking nature, one can clearly guess the turn of events in their lives.Scene 22: Done for goodJim leaves for Paris on a call from his newspaper. He bids a warm goodbye, with promises of coming back and having children with Cat. However, the underlying part of this scene is more to show that trouble maybe just around the corner for the couple. The metaphorical sequence of a train leaving from right to left is always a sign of something opposite to happen in the lives of people.
Jim, back in Paris confesses to Gilberta of his marriage plans, which obviously has her heartbroken.
Following which, he meets several of his acquaintances at the hotel, all of whom certainly inquire about Jim.
In the films context, this is a way of saying that with all that Jim has done at Jules place, he needs to ask this to himself: Hows Jules?
Jim also runs against Teresa, the smoking engine, who has an influencing 2 minute chatter with Jim. In this, she describes all her past flings and experiences, and finally that of settling with one man. This explains why, Teresa can be no match to Catherines eccentricity because she finally settles with one man after all her soul searching. So, it means if a man can restrict a woman with just one desire and satisfy it again and again he can have the girl for ever.
Jim plans to go back, but is stopped by Gilberta. She pleads him to stay back for a week citing that he will have Catherine for a lifetime now.
Jim writes back saying he has certain farewells to accomplish. This sparks some trouble in Cats mind, if he truly loves her.
All in all, Jims trip back to Paris only sparks unrest in the relationship, and further scenes can supposedly be reactionary.Scene 23: Back to square oneThis is a scene where Jules and Jim are together for the first time in the absence of Catherine. They end up discussing her a lot, and with Catherine gone away for a while, like before, Jim decides to return to Paris, away from this entire muddle.
Jim is surprised to find Jules receiving him at the station and not Catherine. On reaching back to the chalet, he finds that Catherine has taken her small sabbatical yet again. Jim and Jules end up discussing her.
For the first time, it seems that he understands her. He calls her the real woman, full of desires and whims. He believes, that is the reason they love her so much, and because of this love, Catherine truly feels like a queen between them. This probably explains the affinity of each of them with the other two, and why they stick around in spite of their misgivings towards each other from time to time. Jim, however, wishes not to go through what Jules faced, and wishes to leave immediately. Jules agrees to play along, when Catherine suddenly bumps in from the window. This shot signifies the free radical nature of Catherine. She left home like a free bird, in an attempt to settle scores when she realised that Jim would stay back to bid farewell to his people. Usually, we find women ranting and getting depressed about all this, instead, Catherine believes in letting herself loose, and finding someone who would suit her state of mind for that time.
Scene 24: Paradise Lost?Jim soon gets to know from Catherine of her recent escapade. It is her way of balancing things. She knew, Jims delay was to stay with Gilberta, and she had her own time to neutralise things. This was Catherines way of living.
Our patriarchal society will never agree to this, and brand her as a slut and what not. But, isnt the logic simple, if you are ready to occupy equal positions in a relationship, rather than dominate it as per the society?
Catherine did to Jim, what he tried to do and hoped to escape. It is justified of Catherine to do so, and free herself of any angst, and at the same time remove an guilt from Jims end.
A way of starting the relationship from scratch rather than living with the thought of having a mate who is shared.
This treatment shatters Jim, but, overnight he gets the message, and being mutually in love, they take the relationship forward.
They remain chaste form some time to ensure that the Cat isnt pregnant from her recent act, and then start trying. Somehow, Cat doesnt conceive and the couple is found visiting doctors to identify the problem.
The entire scene keeps up with the personality of Catherine, and although has startled audiences over generations, it delivers the simple message of gender equality very effectively. On one hand, we have Gilberta as a woman who faces angst and depression on account of losing out to Jim, and is ready to wait forever, even with the fact of sharing him with Catherine. This is nothing but a society sponsored definition of love, and actually a compromise.
Catherine stands against this system, and fights for herself. Remarkably, she fights this way for herself, and not as an activist, signifying how each woman must do this in her life to overcome the bias, and not wait for a feminist movement to remove this social discord.Scene 25: The OR dealJim and Catherine are no longer a happy couple. They still love each, at least Jim does, but two things make Catherine feel sick about everything 1.	She is tired of waiting to have a child, which probably will never come.
2.	Jim is still in touch with Gilberta, and she cannot stand his ambivalent state of mind, something she has gone through.
Clearly, men cannot agree to sharing their woman sexually, whereas, women cannot stand sharing their man on an emotional level.
Their quarrel makes Jim decide for a temporary break-up of 3 months, and they will reunite if they are still in love.
Catherines dialogue at this juncture is important:
Are you in pain?Not me, not anymore.Because we mustn't suffer...not at the same timeOnce you stop suffering, l'll suffer (Jules And Jim Script - Dialogue Transcript)Catherine actually enjoys this situation and believes her time of suffering might come too if she is to really miss Jim in coming days.
She walks into Jules room, and they have a very emotional conversation. Probably, for the first time in the movie, Cat opens her heart out to Jules. Jules supports her really well, smokes a cigarette after a long time, and assures Catherine of Jims honesty and his own love for her.
Wait, we suddenly realise that Jim alone isnt ambivalent. During their heart rending conversation, Jules pledges his love for Cat, to which she responds:
I love you too
This might be considered as a usual retort to I love you in todays times, but is actually used for saying, that apart from Jim, I love you too.
Thus ends the scene with Jim leaving for Paris, and Jules role being to be alongside Cat, something he attaches a lot of importance to.Scene 26: CounterbalanceCat and Jim leave for the station. On this foggy day, train is rescheduled, and they book a hotel for the day. The entire day is spent without a word being exchanged. Jim, in his thoughts thinks about what could /couldnt have happened/happen.
Catherine scrubbing her face is a treat to watch, as if clearing her conscience of what has gone by.
Truffauts brilliance makes this scene memorable. It could have been passed of as a lewd scene with some love-making, but, instead he chooses to show the maturity in their relationship and signs off.
Jim leaves, and the train leaving from right to left is a sign of things going in a downwards spiral.Scene 27: Amores PerrosJim is back in Paris and very ill. Gilberta takes care of him, and he is back in an epistolic relationship with Catherine. They exchange letters, where Cat wants him back as she is pregnant. Jim, is ill and doubts if Cat speaks the truth. Anyway, he finds it disgusting to think of the child, if it really is coming, belonging to Albert.
He sends a stern reply, till he finds an emotionally loaded letter, talking about the soon-to-be born, the emotions of Cat flowing across the letter. The woman he loves, is pregnant and this solves all their past issues. Jim decides to rush to Voges this time.
One thing is clear from the scene, that women although cheated upon everywhere, are less insecure compared to men. They are scary to some extent, and their insecurity of sharing their girl with someone else, transcends all boundaries.
Also, just when Jim decides to come back, he receives a message that the child has died in pre-natal stage. He thinks that Catherines way of trying to redefine the rules of life (read society), have actually killed the seed of life. It is now about staying away, and leading their own lives with Jules and Gilberta respectively.Scene 28: Str(i)angulationJim bumps into Jules by chance in Paris. Jules and Catherine have moved to Paris. They plan to meet at Jules place. Catherine now owns a car. The trio set out for eating out, and bump into Albert at the restaurant. Entire co-incidental scene appears too good to be true. They have food together, and Catherine decides to stay back with Albert for the night.
Jules and Jim discuss about Catherine. She now wields a gun, and has been showing suicidal tendencies of late. Jules now seems to be a better man, with his experience in this relationship. He now shows the maturity, earlier only Jim could have shown. He understands Catherine better than Jim.
Jules acknowledges Jims decision to marry Gilberta, as he has moved on at the right time. Jim asserts its because, once its over with Cat, its truly over.
Something that Jules also had experienced before. The entire shot of the trio together is full of tension and the interactions are formal and solemn. Catsmotto has always been: For a couple, atleast one has to always be faithful, namely the other. These words artistically sum up her character.Scene 29: Not with you, Not without youCatherine literally stalks Jim, at his place with her car, honking the horn and driving around curves in the out. If the car is assumed to represent her, then this driving describes her rendezvous with the different men in her life, and the way she has moved on from one relationship to another.
She then calls upon Jim, and they have a small conversation here. Cat wants him back, but Jim refuses saying he will be marrying Gilberta. The entire argument moves to how Catherine has tried to explore love, but as a pioneer she wasnt humble, but, egocentric instead. This has created a mess in the lives of Jules, Gilberta and many more.
Their discussion throws light on Truffauts attempted message throughout the film. For the first time, he explicitly sends his message through the words of Jim.
Jim agrees to the curiosity that everyone has about love. This is something beyond the boundaries of society. He also appreciates Cats motive of discovering love beyond social stigma, which is hypocrisy at best anyway. Cats principle of love and couple not matching up is also highlighted. But, Jim believes that one always has to move on in life, and that this curiosity of being a rebel has to be curbed when trying to find love with someone.
Clearly, Catherine who can be an inspiration to men and women alike wrt her take on love, messes up here start by not trying to control her curiosity even once. Her line-up of relationships, have to get complicated and probably impossible, if someone from the partners turns up to be like her. Hence, when Jim became ambivalent like her, and literally started two-timing, Catherine couldnt bear the taste of her own medicine. No wonder then that an entire effort in a new direction fell apart. Cat cannot take this reality anymore and attempts to shot at Jim. He somehow escapes, and their equation is all but over.
Truffaut believes in repeating a point thrice in the movie to make it stay with the audience, and hence, the free spirited life of Catherine is demonstrated thrice through Teresa, Catherine herself and the plays and finally though the words of Jim.
Left with no other option, Jim now resigns himself to the institution of marriage. Eventually, everyone finds himself/herself back to following social norms.Scene 30: Alls well, when the ends NOT wellA few months later, the trio happen to cross each other at a hall. Jim is happy to see Jules, and not so excited about seeing Catherine again. Cat insists on going out on a drive, and they all go for it. She drives recklessly, and it gives the feeling of her mood swings to some extent. It definitely must be a surge of blood within, as she sees Jim after about three months.
The trio stop over at a café in a dance hall. The entire footage is shot at a fast pace showcasing the intensity in the minds of the characters. Also, the way of shooting the driving scene is fantastic considering the technology available in the early 60s.
At the café, Jules discusses with Jim about his relationship with Catherine. He recounts how Jim easily got along with her, but, eventually proved to be a bit too much to handle for even Catherine. Simply, Jules here is suggesting how Catherines tendency to discover love with multiple partners, was justified, but, she couldnt take it when Jim loved Gilberta apart from her. She couldnt tolerate sharing her love. Jules, though appears wiser with his own experience, still cannot comprehend Jims love for Catherine.This scene has a metaphorical placement of drinking glasses on the table. There are two glasses on one side of the table, and the third one adrift. The two glasses cannot symbolise Jules and Cat, because Cat doesnt go back to a love she has overcome. Same is the case for Cat and Jim. Without doubt, it is about Jules and Jim, and the camaraderie and homo-eroticism shared between the two in several previous scenes suggests, that this is perhaps the only everlasting relationship of the film. At this time, Catherine asks Jim to join her for a ride, and asks Jules to keep watching.
They ride together, and in a few minutes the car is on a bridge, which is broken at the other end, and the car crosses this end only to plunge into the river. It reminisces of Catherines fall into the Seine, but only that this one is more tragic than imagined. Interestingly, this part has been improvised by Truffaut and the scripter Gruault, and is not from the book.
Jules as usual continues to be dazed by Catherines capriciousness and he really cant get enough of her dead or alive. The scene of the car going down is representative of the downward spiral, the duo went through in the last few months, as also gives the message of how such relationships cannot work out for long. As long as, only one of the two partners was ambivalent and had multiple partners, it seemed fine. But, it all went haywire when Catherine met almost her equal in Jim. Jules, who had always been a spectator to Catherines actions, at best is feeling a sense of Relief.
Subors narration from hereon is soothing as a contrast to the chilling climax. He narrates the entire cremation process.
Jules is left with Sabine, and the rest is all gone into ashes. Jim and Catherine are incinerated considering their Catholic practices. Jules would have their ashes mixed.
Catherine wanted hers to be strewn from a hill-top, but it wasnt permitted.
The urns with the ashes are sealed and kept away.
The entire cremation scene, with a compelling background narration has been shot in a marvellous way. Catherine, the free soul wanted her ashes to become a part of the earth and the air. This was not permitted by laws. It is a brilliant metaphor for how, the idea of freedom a woman is not accepted by the patriarchal society, and all the movements form women equality are in vain, unless something so simple for a woman to equal man in terms of rights is granted.
Jules walks off, and one can interpret it as a walk back to the society, which will permit the usual relationships, and probably outlaw characters like Catherine.
From Jims angle, it was about moving on, and reading Catherine correctly, almost every time, but for the last moments.
From Catherines perspective, it was always about settling scores. It was about ferociously pursuing her love, and be very non-chalant about it at the same time.
She really brought a closure to the story and her relationship, where her intense love for Jim lead to only one message Not with you, Not without you."

For various, vague reasons their servants desert them as the guests arrive, leaving the bourgeois group to a truncated meal, a pretentious piano recital, enigmatic and sometimes absurdest conversation, boorish manners, and indiscreet romantic assignations. At 4 a.m. the Nobiles begin to question why no one has left, and when the dawn arrives, the estate's majordomo is unable to prepare breakfast because the usual delivery of daily provisions has mysteriously not arrived. As the day drones on, they slowly begin to realize that they are gripped by an inexplicable inertia that keeps them confined to the room. They make no conscious attempt to overcome their constraints but accept this self-imposed quarantine because no one else seems to make the effort.

During World War II, 12-year old Ivan works as a spy on the eastern front. The small Ivan can cross the German lines unnoticed to collect information. Three Soviet officers try to take care of this boy-child.—Mattias Thuresson It's the middle of WWII in Russia. Orphaned pre-teen Ivan Bondarev does reconnaissance work for the military. He is able to get through small cracks where adults could not, both because of his small physical size and the fact that no one would suspect a boy of doing such work. Despite his tough exterior, he often dreams about happy situations with his mother, who, along with his sister, was exterminated in a concentration camp. Those dreams usually end violently. After Ivan obtains some information concerning an advancing German troop, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, wants to send him to military school as he believes the offensive is no place for a boy. Ivan vows to run away and join the partisans in their work if he is sent away. After an attempt to run away, Ivan is allowed to stay and continue his reconnaissance work during the offensive. Ivan's stay is not the only one questioned, but also Masha's, a female medical officer who some believe is not mentally or physically strong enough to endure the horrors of the front lines of war, while others romantically yearn for her. Regardless, Ivan's colleagues and superiors, many who view him as a son, openly ponder his life post-war, that is if he and they make it out alive.—Huggo As the German Wehrmacht advances on the hammered Eastern Front during the dark years of World War II, the 12-year-old orphan of war, Ivan Bondarev, insists on performing covert operations and reconnaissance missions for the Soviet Army, after the brutal death of his family by the Nazis. Surrounded by the horrors and the madness of war, young Ivan is cared for almost as a son by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov and Captain Leonid Kholin--who for fear of the boy's safety--attempt to get the cherished scout away from the enemy lines and in the safety of a military school. But the inflexible Ivan thirsts to avenge the death of his parents and begs for another mission behind the front lines. Will Ivan ever find freedom in a dangerous world?—Nick Riganas As the film opens, a 12-year-old boy is running through an open field laughing and strolling in a carefree manner. As he runs around, he encounters his mother and informs her that there is a cuckoo in a tree. The boy, Ivan Bondarev (Nikolay Burlyaev) suddenly wakes up, revealing that the previous scene was a dream. He currently spends his nights in a windmill and leaves the building to explore. The windmill is in the middle of an open field with abandoned farm equipment with smoke swirling around. Next, the boy is wading through marshes and tall grasses as the sun is setting. While he wades through, flares are sent up and he encounters barbed wire. The film cuts to the title screen.A Russian officer wakes up Comrade Senior Lieutenant Galtsev (Yevgeni Zharikov) in the middle of the night because they found a boy crossing the Dnepr River. Ivan, wet and shivering, asks the informer to leave and declares himself Bondarev, asking for Number 51 at headquarters. Galtsev makes the first call and is ridiculed by the man on the phone. When he informs Bondarev that he will need to be locked up, Ivan insists that he calls again and even provides Galtsev with the code address of VCH 49550. When Galtsev gets through Number 51, he is instructed to provide the Ivan with paper and a pen and send him anything that the boy writes down. Galtsev realizes the importance of the boy and follows the orders in addition to providing the boy with food and a bath. Ivan counts pine needs and seeds, displaying a code and seals the envelope for it to be delivered. After, Ivan takes a bath and eats his food before falling asleep.As the sound of water drips in the barrack, Ivan dreams of his mother and himself dropping a feather into a well. During this dream, his mother and he speak of a star that remains in the well. Later, Ivan is in the well reaching for the allusive star as his mother is shot, presumably by German soldiers. Ivan awakes to see that Galtsev is still in the room. Ivan admits to becoming jittery and inquires whether he talks in his sleep. As this conversation ends, Captain Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) enters the room and Ivan and Kholin share a warm, familial embrace. Ivan is informed that Corporal Katasonov is still waiting for him at Hollow Tree but is surrounded by Germans. Ivan informs Kholin that because he is so small, he was able to get away and swim across the river. Kholin is not pleased with this fact, especially because Ivan has lost so much weight; this scene displays how much Kholin cares for Ivan and treats him like a son. At this point, Kholin provides Ivan with clothing.In the next scene, Ivan is informed that he will be sent to military school and disapproves of the decision stating that he must continue to fight the Germans. Because Kholin and Katasonov have taken such a liking to Ivan, the wish to see him succeed and leave the front lines. Due to Ivans disapproval, he runs away to the countryside where he finds an old man (Dmitri Milyutenko). After a few minutes of conversing, a Russian car comes speeding up to retrieve Ivan.

Unfortunately, Ivan had already read all of that material during the last three days. Ivan takes interest in an art book. While showing Ivan the art book, Galtsev overhears Kholin and Katasonov making plans to take Ivan on another mission across the Dnepr River. Galtsev offers to join, but they do not need him. Ivan looks through Galtsevs belongings and finds a knife that once belonged to Galtsevs friend. When Ivan asks for the knife, Galtsev reluctantly gives him the weapon.Later, outside the trenches, Galtsev inquires about what will happen to Ivan once the war is over. Kholin informs him that Katasonov or the Colonel will adopt him. The scene cuts to Ivan who sets up a practice hunt of German soldiers in order to avenge his familys murder. During this, a real German air raid begins. Galtsev returns to the barracks where he checks on Ivan, cleans up the room, and is informed by Ivan that he wants to continue to fight.Kholin returns to Ivan later that day and informs Ivan that Katasonov was sent back to headquarters before he could say goodbye to Ivan. Instead, Ivan will be accompanied by Kholin and Galtsev across the river. The three eat dinner and Ivan falls asleep. During this time, he dreams of the time when he rode atop an apple truck with his sister in the rain as the truck drove onto the beach. As the apples fall out of the truck on the beach, horses eat the fallen apples, and Ivan and his sister enjoy the rain on their skin. During this dream, Kholin wakes Ivan in order to get ready for the night. While getting ready, Ivan expresses his anger that Katasonov did not visit him prior to his departure. The three get dressed and prepare to leave to cross the river. Kholin advises Galtsev to make a diversion while he and Ivan get to the boat. While making the diversion, Galtsev discovers that Katasonov was shot and they are hiding it from Ivan.Kholin, Ivan, and Galtsev row across the Dnepr River, wade through the marshes, and eventually say their goodbyes as Ivan must begin his crossing. Once Ivan left, Kholin and Galtsev row back across the river, meet some artillery fire, but get back safely to the barracks. Once there, they play the gramophone only to be interrupted by Masha as she says goodbye to Galtsev.Later, the scene is in Berlin after Russia has won the war. As troops sift through the paperwork, a scarred and war-torn Galtsev finds Ivans file and discovers that he was captured and executed.

Sanjuro,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056443/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A crafty samurai helps a young man and his fellow clansmen trying to save his uncle, who has been framed and imprisoned by a corrupt superintendent. A wandering samurai, Sanjuro, is drawn into local politics. The Superintendent of a clan is plotting to take over the clan by implicating the Chamberlain in corrupt activities (activities the Superintendent is actually responsible for). Part of the plan involves killing off the Chamberlain's staff and, in protecting them, Sanjuro sides with them. The supporters are massively outnumbered so it will require all of Sanjuro's cunning and swordcraft to ensure the Superintendent does not succeed in his evil plan.—grantss A group of idealistic young men, determined to clean up the corruption in their town, are aided by a scruffy, cynical samurai who does not at all fit their concept of a noble warrior.—Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> In Japan circa Eighteenth Century, nine young men decide to present an accusation of corruption in their clan to the local superintendent. However, the group is betrayed, but the ronin Sanjûrô Tsubaki (Toshirô Mifune) saves them from the superintendent's men. The uncle of the leader of the rebel clansmen, the Chamberlain Mutsuta (Yûnosuke Itô), is kidnapped, and his wife and daughter are detained and made prisoner of the superintendent, and he tries to force Mutsuta to write a fake confession letter declaring being corrupt. Sanjûrô helps the group to rescue the Chamberlain and his family.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The story begins with nine young samurai, who are worried about corruption in the leadership of their clan. Although they know of two elders who are ""bad,"" the youths misjudge who the real mastermind behind these two is, and end up asking that wrong one for help. As the nine meet secretly at a temple and discuss their problem, a ronin (Mifune) suddenly appears from another room. The ronin explains the stupidity and naiveté of their conclusions and decides to help them.The plot then unfolds as he tries to outwit the three evil elders and their minions, with the young samurai constantly ruining his plans. Despite evidence to the contrary, some of them continue to regard the ronin as a problem figure: he has bad manners, behaviour unbecoming of a samurai, weird ways to express his thoughts, and bizarre attitude to violence. He insults his companions directly, and prefers to sleep around rather than accompany them on missions. He obviously has no compunction killing people, often unnecessarily.A key objective is the rescue of Mutsuta, an honest official, and his family. Mutsuta's wife (played by Takao Irie) is rescued early on, but remains strangely oblivious to the danger around her, and maintains a cheery civility in comic contrast to the tension of the young samurai. She asks the ronin's name; looking out the window at tsubaki (camellia) trees, he invents the name Tsubaki Sanjr (from sanj 'thirty', because he always aks for thirty ryo). The lady insists as if advising him on table manners that Mr Tsubaki refrain from unnecessary killing. The lady shows insight when she compares Sanjuro to a ""glittering sword"" and remarks that ""the best sword stays in its scabbard.""The nine young samurai begin as innocent idealistic greenhorns who judge on appearances, are easily duped by a more experienced elder, and are quick to stumble into danger without even knowing what they are doing. They end wiser: they have learned the virtues of patience.The famous final scene of his duel with Hanbei, the henchman of the corrupt superintendent, is poignant. Throughout the story, Sanjuro poses as a bad ronin who is after making a quick score. He is so convincing that Hanbei (Tatsuya Nakadai) swallows his line and becomes the unwitting accomplice of his own demise. He cannot stand being made a fool and challenges Sanjuro to a duel. Sanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei saying that if they do fight, one of them would die and there is nothing to be gained from that.Hanbei insists and the two face each other. And then, in a flash, it's over: a fountain of blood gushes from Hanbei and he slumps to the ground, lifeless. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes extremely agitated and angry at their naive insensitivity . In the most revealing remark, he states that dead adversary was exactly like him, so that at least he now has an understanding of what he really represents. Sanjuro then leaves towards an unspecified direction"

The patient stops breathing and the senior Dr. Cortner (Bruce Brighton) laments, ""I should have known he was a good as dead when they wheeled him in.""

He runs back to Dad's house in the country carrying Jan's head in his arms like a football. When he gets to the palatial estate he calls to his assistant, Kurt, while pounding on the front door. Kurt (Anthony La Penna as Leslie Daniel) answers the door, still wearing his lab coat. His left arm is paralyzed, his left hand is drawn back into a claw, the skin dark and leathery. Bill explains there has been an accident. He is cradling Jan's head in his arms, he is frantic. ""I've got to save her,"" he tells Kurt. Kurt tries to relay his concern about the thing in the closet, but Bill insists, ""For Gods sake Kurt, this is urgent. Do as I tell you before its too late. I can't waste precious time arguing with you."" The two walk downstairs to the lab and hook up equipment. Bill carefully pours a test tube of liquid into a flask. The time is now 10:20 and we see what all the frantic work involved. Jan's bandaged head sits in an enamel pan, attached to various tubes and wires. Kurt is astonished and tells Bill, ""The eyelids, I saw them move. It can't be. My eyes are deceiving me."" Bill replies, ""What you see is real. What's done is done, and what I've done is right. It's the work of science."" Jan starts to revive and mumbles, ""I remember fire. Burning. Let me die. Let me die."" Bill reminds Kurt he's had transplant success, but Kurt asks, ""Transplant her to what?"" Bill considers the question, then replies, ""I've brought her back. She'll live and I'll get her another body. I can make her complete again."" Kurt disagrees and voices his objections. Bill does admit he can only keep her alive for 48-50 hours in the pan. We learn that Kurts arm, withered and deformed, was an earlier unsuccessful experiment using an earlier formula. Kurt reminds Bill about the creature in the closet. Bill approaches the heavy door, padlocked on the outside. Something inside is breathing abnormally. Bill peers inside through an observation door near the top. He is horrified by what he sees. ""Keep it locked,"" he tells his assistant. He then turns his attention back to his fiancée, ""I've got to think about her now. I've got to find her a body."" ""How are you going to go about getting one?"" Kurt asks. Bill assures his assistant that there are ways.It is late evening and Bill decides to go cruising at a local strip club, The Moulin Rouge. Outside the entrance, he sees two cut out display boards of strippers, a blonde and a brunette. He likes what he sees, obviously the discriminating shopper. Inside the blonde stripper (Bonnie Sharie) does her show for the patrons of both sexes. Bill wanders in and takes a stool at the bar. Blondie wanders over and bumps and grinds to get Bill's attention. The brunette stripper (Paula Maurice), a bit masculine looking, is jealous of her co-worker. When the blonde finishes her act, she heads for the dressing room. This gives the brunette a chance to make eyes at Bill. A table becomes available and Bill sits down next to the brunette and chats. Blondie comes back and joins Bill at his table. At the house, Jan is resting in her pan. Blondie goes back to her dressing room, and Bill follows. They chat. Jan begins to mumble again about dying. Bill is getting a little anxious and tells the stripper, ""You may be just what I'm looking for."" Before Bill can close the deal, the brunette enters the dressing room and changes. Bill is concerned that a witness is more than he can handle. When the girls get catty with each other, Bill excuses himself. The brunette tells Bill, ""Come back later, I'll remember you."" ""That's what I'm afraid of,"" he replies. The blonde and brunette strippers get into a fight. We close this charming scene with a camera pan up the wall to a pair of cat paintings and someone meowing. [Note: Yes, we get it, a cat fight!]Jan awakens and looks around the lab. Her brain waves register high on the equipment. She calls out to the creature in the closet, ""What has he done to you?"" It is mute, so she directs it to knock once if it hears her. Kurt is attracted by the noises downstairs. Jan expresses her anger and disappointment at Bill for what he's done to her. She invites the creature to join her in a plot of revenge. Kurt goes down to the lab and Jan pretends to be asleep. Kurt tip-toes over to the closet and listens at the door. It pounds on the door and Kurt jumps. Jan laughs hysterically. Kurt runs over to the lab table and confronts his tormentor. Jan asks Kurt, ""What's locked behind that door?"" ""Horror: no normal mind can imagine. Something even more terrible than you,"" Kurt replies. But Jan corrects him, ""No, my deformed friend. Like all quantities of...horror has its ultimate, and I am that."" Kurt explains that Bill's experimental mistakes are summarized by the creature behind the closet door. Jan realizes what Bill has been doing at the country house and Kurt's part in the grotesque work. Kurt lost his arm in a lab accident, and Bill promised to restore it. Jan realizes that Bill intends to transplant her head onto another woman's body. Jan explains the new serum has given her power Bill never expected. She demonstrates for Kurt. The terrified lab assistant runs when the creature tries to force the closet door off its hinges. Kurt runs into Bill in the living room and asks if he was successful in finding a woman. Bill explains he can't be the last person seen with a woman before she disappears.The next morning Bill goes cruising in his car. He runs into a woman acquaintance, Donna Williams (Lola Mason). Donna suggests a bathing beauty contest, so Bill invites her into the car. He makes an excuse to stop at home first, but they run into another woman. A friend of Donna, Jeannie Reynolds (Audrey Devereal as Devereau), joins them in the car. Now with a witness, Bill's plans for Donna are scuttled and the three go to the beauty contest. They sit down just as the M.C. (Bruce Kerr) starts the show. The first contestant is Helen Appleton (uncredited). She is wearing a one-piece swimsuit. Bill nods his approval. Next up is Betty Brockton (uncredited), a blonde with her hair in a single braid and wearing a modest two-piece swimsuit. Terri Lund (uncredited) is the third contestant. She is wearing a one-piece and the crowd applauds. Peggy Howard (Marilyn Hanold) is the final contestant and Bill leers approvingly. Donna notes, ""She has the second nicest body I've ever seen."" Bill assumes Donna is just trolling for a compliment and asks, ""Second to you?"" But Donna quickly corrects Bill and reminds him of Doris, the girl in school who was disfigured by a jealous boyfriend. Donna mentions that Doris is seldom seen and has few friends. Bill is thinking Doris may be perfect for his needs.Jan continues her one-way chat with the creature in the closet and concludes they must stop Bill. Bill drives over to see Doris Powell (Adele Lamont) at her apartment. He walks in and she is posing on a platform for five photographers. Bill sits on the couch and observes the display. Doris stops and puts on a robe and dismisses the photographers. Art (an uncredited Sammy Petrillo) hangs back and suggests some unprofessional work. Doris makes it clear she is not interested and tells him to leave. She confronts Bill, ""See it all, mister? The show's over. Next time bring a camera and buy a ticket. I'm not running a charity."" Bill reminds her they were class mates, but Doris is bitter and tells him she hates all men. She reminds Bill by showing him the scar on her face. Rather than being repulsed, Bill explains that he is a doctor and that his father is a very good plastic surgeon and they can fix her face. Doris is not convinced and tells Bill, ""I've been doctors. It's no use: the scar tissue is too deep. No one can help me."" But Bill convinces her that new techniques are available. He talks her into a consultation at his home with his father. When Doris asks his motive, Bill tells her his version of the truth, ""I'm gonna make your face beautiful again, cut it off and give your body away."" Doris laughs and explains that she believes him. Doris changes her clothes and they drive to the country house.At Jan's direction, the closet creature has been pounding on the door working the hinges loose. Kurt enters the lab with food for the creature. He is in a sarcastic mood, so Jan taunts him with, ""Your formless, sniveling fear becomes you more."" They bicker and Jan directs Kurt over to the closet door. As she distracts Kurt, she summons her friend behind the closet door to attack Kurt. It reaches out through the observation door and pulls Kurt's arm inside. As Kurt struggles, the creature pulls his good arm off at the shoulder. Kurt wanders around the lab and house, smearing blood all over the walls. In cinema's longest death scene, Kurt wanders back to the lab and collapses and dies of shock and blood loss. All the while Jan giggles and laughs.Bill arrives home with Doris. Bill tells Doris he will mix some drinks and they will wait for his father to return. Bill discovers Kurt's body in the lab and covers it with a sheet. He closes, but forgets to lock the observation door and then he mixes the drinks. He adds a powerful sedative to Doris' drink. Bill walks back upstairs and gives Doris the spiked drink. Doris consumes the drink, and then accuses Bill of putting something in her drink. She collapses and Bill carries her down to the lab in his arms. Bill proudly announces to Jan, ""I told you I'd bring you a body. A beautiful one. Soon it will be yours."" Bill rationalizes his intentions to Jan as he prepares for surgery. Jan tells Bill, ""You must be stopped."" Bill needs quiet, so he places a strip of tape over Jan's mouth. Just as Bill prepares to cut off Doris' head, a pounding sound comes from the closet. Bill walks over to the door. He does not notice the observation door is unsecured. He looks back at Jan. The observation door opens and a large hand and arm reaches out to the doctor. It pulls him back and the door pulls loose from the casing. A grotesque creature (Eddie Carmel) emerges, still holding Bill Cortner through the door. It is a misshapen mess with one bulging eye, folds of scar tissue for a face and a pointed head. It carries the door and its victim across the lab. It manages to knock a flask of flammable liquid on the floor starting a fire. It throws Bill to the floor, discards the closet door, and approaches the doctor. It easily picks Bill up in its arms and chews a sizeable piece of his face off. At Jan's direction, it carries the unconscious Doris off the operating table and out of the burning lab. A stunned and dazed Dr. Cortner is still lying on the floor. Jan tells him, ""I told you to let me die."" We close to a black screen and Jan laughing. [Note: The end title card reads, The Head That Wouldn't Die and a copyright year as 1960.]"

Birdman of Alcatraz,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055798/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A surly convicted murderer held in permanent isolation redeems himself when he becomes a renowned bird expert. In 1912, the notorious and violent prisoner Robert Franklin Stroud is transferred to the Leavenworth Prison convicted for murdering a man. When a guard cancels the visit of his mother, Elizabeth Stroud, due to a violation of the internal rules, he stabs and kills the guard and goes to trial three times. He is sentenced to be executed by the gallows, but his mother appeals to President Woodrow Wilson who commutes his sentence to life imprisonment. However, the warden, Harvey Shoemaker, decides to keep Stroud in solitary for the rest of his life. One day, Stroud finds a sparrow that has fallen from the nest in the yard and he raises the bird until it is strong enough to fly. Stroud finds a motivation for his life raising and caring for birds and becomes an expert in birds. He marries Stella Johnson and together they run a business, providing medicine developed by Stroud. But a few years after, Stroud is transferred to Alcatraz and has to leave his birds behind.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The incarcerated life ofRobert Stroudat Leavenworth and Alcatraz from 1912 to 1959 - the last forty-three of those years in solitary confinement - is presented, that end date which is when he is about to leave Alcatraz for good, the result of the writings of advocateThomas E. Gaddis. Stroud's story starts in year three of his twelve year sentence for manslaughter. In the eyes of the authorities, he is seen as dangerous and unrepentant, not so much of the crime itself but of what they see as his stand against their authority. That attitude leads to him murdering someone else in prison, which ultimately results in a life sentence to be spent in solitary confinement. His life begins to change in 1920 when he finds an abandoned baby sparrow in the prison courtyard. This find begins a self-taught life as an ornithology expert, most specifically in combating bird diseases, many which had no known cure before his findings. Over the course of his imprisonment, his relationships with those people key to what happens to him are shown. They include: his mother, who began as his sole focus in life early in his incarceration, but with who he had a falling out late in her life; Harvey Shoemaker, the prison warden at both Leavenworth and Alcatraz for the better part of his incarceration, and who was in many respects his chief antagonist based on their differing views of the penal system in general; Bull Ransom, who was his primary guard for most of his stay at Leavenworth; and Stella Johnson, whose initial connection to him is through their mutual interest in birds.—Huggo As an inmate at Leavenworth prison, Robert Stroud has a series of confrontations with the guards and with the other convicts. When Stroud kills a guard, he is sentenced to be executed, and only his mother's impassioned intervention gets his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, which he must serve in solitary confinement. As he serves out his sentence in boredom and despair, one day he finds a helpless baby sparrow in the exercise yard. Stroud soon takes a deep interest in caring for birds, which gives him a new purpose in life, but which also brings new conflicts with prison authorities.—Snow Leopard A true-life drama about Robert Stroud who educated himself in the science of birds while spending 53 years in prison. He became a world authority on birds. Convicted of murder twice, the second time for killing a prison guard, Robert Stroud is sentenced to life in solitary confinement.

James, formerly an actor, is a spendthrift despite having money.

Jamie largely blames his father for not spending the money early in their illnesses for Mary and Edmund's health/medical problems. Otherwise, Jamie has largely been aimless in his life. He has followed in James' footsteps in becoming an actor solely because James gave him the opportunity, but places no effort in it as a career.

There might be a third and atomic world war, after which no ordinary man could survive. But now and then children are born who are ""naturally"" radio-active and have cold blood. They might survive in the post-war world and carry on mankind. They are fetched and brought to an underground construction where they are educated by TV. They are told that they are on a space ship moving toward the earth, which they should eventually colonize.

Wells is beaten up and robbed.Later Joan approaches Wells on his small boat. He is prepared to forgive and forget, she implies that he asked for it after trying to pick her up. At that moment they are threatened by King and his gang. Wells sets off on his boat and calls on Joan to join him which she does, defying her over-protective (and rather incestious) brother.After drifting out to sea, Joan decides to go back and confront King, who has previously locked her into a cupboard when she has come close to other men. King and his gang keep a watch-out for them.At night Wells and Joan return to a quiet part of the mainland and make love in a cliff top house surrounded by curious sculptures. Caught up and surrounded by the gang, the couple escape into a nearby military base where guards and dogs are soon in pursuit of them all.The house was rented by sculptress Freya Neilson (Viveca Lindfors) whose lover, Bernard (Alexander Knox), is a scientist who runs the base. He will not discuss his work, warning her that he ""might be condemning her to death"".Wells and Joan make their way down the cliff face. King goes after them. There they discover a network of caves and bunkers occupied by a small group of young boys and girls, aged about 11. Although well-dressed, cared-for and educated, it is clear that they do not know much about the outside world. The children's skin is also cold at the touch.In fact the children are confined to the bunker which is the underground part of the military base. The premises, which double as a schoolroom and living quarters, are filled with surveillance cameras. Access to the children is limited though they are occasionally visited by men in radiation suits. Bernard gives them lessons via a TV monitor, but dismisses some of their more searching questions, saying that they will learn the answers ""when the time comes"".The children do not even know much about where they are. One of them actually believes that they are in a spaceship and are to populate a distant planet.The children have a small hideout in a connecting cave where they keep pictures and mementoes of people they think are their parents. They believe that it is a safe and secret place but Bernard and his associates are well aware of it. Bernard, who is, in his own way, genuinely fond of the children, has allowed them this degree of privacy in spite of objections by the head of security Major Holland (Walter Gotell).Time passes and Wells, Joan and King feel increasingly unwell, but Wells and Joan have promised to help the children escape and pressure King into helping them. The children keep them fed by ably smuggling food pass the surveillance cameras into the hideout.Since security has been unable to find the intruders, Bernard tells the children via the TV monitor that he knows their secret and asks that they give up the grown-ups that they are hiding there.

The children rebel and destroy the cameras.Men in radiation suits then enter the premises but are overpowered and even killed by Wells and King. Using a Geiger counter, Wells discovers that it is in fact the children themselves who are radioactive. Nevertheless he agrees to break them out.

Freya Neilson, the sculptress, witnesses the events.King drives off in a sports car accompanied by Henry (Kit Williams), one of the children. Weakened by the radioactivity, King orders Henry out of the car saying that he is ""poison"". Henry is then grabbed by pursuers and forcibly taken back to the bunker in a helicopter.Chased by another helicopter, King crashes his car into a river. Joan and Wells are allowed to leave on his boat, but the sickness catches up with them and the boat goes round and round in the sea monitored by a military helicopter, which will destroy the boat once its occupants are dead.Bernard's only real regret about the whole affair is that ""his"" children now know for sure that they are ""freaks"" and prisoners and will be more difficult to control. He explains to Neilson that they were radioactive from birth. The plan is to release them ""when the time comes"", i.e. the inevitable nuclear war. Their bodies will resist the nuclear fallout and the human race will continue. Now that Neilson knows his secret, Bernard kills her. (In the 1950s and early 60s, the threat of nuclear war was very real, a matter of ""when"" not ""if"", and culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis.)The film ends with the children desperately and vainly calling for help from their cliff side prison."

H.M.S. Avenger is headed into battle against the French fleet during the Napoleonic Wars, and the dark shadow of two recent mutinies in the English fleet concern Captain Vere (Sir Peter Ustinov). He relies on his cruel and often sadistic Master-at-Arms John Claggert (Robert Ryan) to maintain what he believes to be tenuous order and discipline aboard the ship. When a new seaman, Billy Budd (Terence Stamp), is pressed into service from a passing merchantman, his innocent, happy-go-lucky attitude quickly endears him to his messmates as well as the ship's officers. However, his charismatic naivete seems to bother Claggert, whose perverse depravity makes him resent Billy's good-natured purity, especially after the teenager's promotion to fore-top Captain. The mean-spirited Claggert unfairly plots to put him on report and ultimately perjures himself when he accuses Billy of conspiring to mutiny.—Gabe Taverney (duke1029@aol.com) It's 1797. Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a crew member of the British merchant ship the ""Rights of Man"" sailing off the coast of Spain, when the ship is briefly commandeered by the British Naval Ship, H.M.S. Avenger. The officers of the Avenger decide to impress Budd into their service as is their right under British marine law. The young, somewhat innocent Budd, to whom honesty is the most noble trait, is quick to make friends with his new crewmen, but learns quickly that life aboard a Naval ship, this Naval ship in particular, is different than aboard a merchant ship when he sees one of his fellow crewmen being flogged. The reason for the flogging is unknown, and could be, as the elder Dansker (Melvyn Douglas), a fellow crew member, states, solely because it was his time. The instigator of the flogging and of seemingly other unprovoked brutality is the ship's Master at Arms, John Claggart (Robert Ryan). The ship's Captain, Edwin Fairfax Vere (Sir Peter Ustinov), knows the type of man that Claggart is, and does not condone his actions. Budd, in turn, does not hate Claggart as do most of the other crewmen, but tries to understand him. When Vere is the sole witness in an incident between Claggart and Budd, Vere, with the help of his officers, has to decide what is just, what is the best for the Avenger and what is best for the British Admiralty, especially in this time of war.—Huggo"

Bondi's tamed spirit and conventional outlook force Burns to address the very real mortality of his old-fashioned idealism. Burns makes a break for the border on his beloved horse Whisky, determined to preserve his chosen lifestyle.—Mae Moreno The movie opens with modern day cowboy Jack Burns (Kirk Douglas) stretched out beside a dying campfire at dawn, awakened by the roar of fighter jets above the vast, open scrub-lands of New Mexico. Burns is a cowboy ill at ease with the modern world of the early 1960s. He rolls his own smokes and cuts through fences when they block his path. He carries no ID, not even the requisite draft card. He is on a collision course with the world around him. His only constant companionship comes from Whiskey, his spirited and beloved buckskin mare.Burns rides into Duke City, New Mexico, crossing a busy highway atop his spooked horse and nearly getting killed in the process. He surprises Jerry Bondi (Gena Rowlands), the wife of his best friend, in her kitchen. Her husband Paul (Michael Kane) is in jail, having been sentenced to two years in prison for assisting Mexican immigrants who have crossed into the United States illegally. Burns wants to go see him, but Jerry explains that the next visiting opportunity is several days off. Burns divulges that he has been forced to herd sheep just to earn a living. He says he started for Duke City as soon as he learned of Paul's plight.Meanwhile, a long-distance truck driver (Carroll O'Connor) exits a diner in Joplin, Missouri and climbs into the cab of his vehicle, headed for Duke City.

He finds a Mexican bar and heads for a back table with his beer and a whiskey chaser. On the way to his table, he trips over the intentionally outstretched foot of a one-armed man (Bill Raisch). Burns starts to complain, then notices the man's missing arm and apologizes. Burns sits down, drains a glass of whiskey, and starts nursing his beer, but the one-armed man suddenly throws a whiskey bottle across the room and over Burns' table. Burns calmly tells the man to watch himself and returns to his beer. The man then throws his whiskey glass and hits Burns with it. Burns once again tries to avoid a confrontation, but the man gets up from his table and approaches threateningly. He obviously has a chip on his shoulder and wants Burns to fight him. He kicks the chair out from under Burns, dumping him onto the floor. Amazingly, Burns still tries to avoid a fight, offering the truculent man a drink. The man calls Burns a coward, provoking Burns to slap him. Burns offers to even things up by putting one arm behind his back, and a savage fight ensues. The one-armed man is more than a match for Burns, using his good arm, the stump of his missing arm, a chair, a billiard ball, and a cue stick to attack Burns. A wild melee erupts with a group of patrons before the police arrive. Burns is taken to the police station, only to discover that the cells are overloaded and he is therefore being released.

Burns climbs down the side of the jailhouse with the aid of a blanket for a rope and returns to Jerry's house. Jerry packs him some food before he gathers up spare ammunition and puts a saddle on Whiskey. It is now revealed that Burns and Jerry were once in love before Jack selflessly backed away in favor of Paul. Burns kisses Jerry goodbye and rides off, certain that his pursuers won't be far behind.Sheriff Johnson soon learns that escapee Jack Burns served in the army during the Korean War, earning a Purple Heart and the DSC, along with jail time for striking an officer. Up in the foothills, Burns watches over his shoulder for activity down below and heads for a distant mountain ridge that promises safety. The route gets steeper and more difficult with every switchback. Burns spots several armed deputies in pursuit far below. He is forced to dismount and lead Whiskey up the slippery and treacherous mountain face. Sheriff Johnson is lent the use of a helicopter by a general at the local army base to locate Burns. The skittish horse causes Burns considerable delay, allowing the helicopter crew to spot him. Burns expertly puts a rifle bullet through the tail rotor to cause the helicopter to have to land and it spirals down and crashes without killing the crew.Deputy Gutierrez, involved in the chase, eventually comes across the tethered horse and thinks he has gotten the drop on Burns, but he feels a rifle barrel pressed up against his face. Burns repays his earlier vicious beating with a rifle butt across the face of the sadistic deputy, knocking him out cold. Burns now leads Whiskey up an incredibly steep talus slope where the horse nearly plunges down the mountainside. They are rapidly approaching the summit and freedom, but the deputies are closing in. Just as the deputies are able to get a clean shot at him, Burns reaches the crest and quickly mounts up, spurring his horse into a thick stand of timber on the other side with complete concealment. Burns discovers that a bullet has passed through his boot and into his lower leg. He gingerly slides off the horse and fashions a splint from his rifle stock. Mounted up again, Burns rides down to the edge of an interstate highway at night during a heavy downpour. Across the highway is Manzano Mountain and the freedom of Mexico.Barreling down the rain-slick highway is the tractor-trailer introduced earlier, carrying the load of toilets. Burns desperately tries to maintain control over his nervous horse and coax him across the highway through the heavy traffic. At the critical moment, Whiskey spooks and rears up in the middle of the highway. The truck driver cannot possibly stop in time, slamming into man and horse and hurling them onto the shoulder. As a crowd gathers and surrounds the injured Jack Burns, Whiskey screams in agony. Burns is in obvious shock, but every scream from the horse is registered on his contorted face. Sheriff Johnson and a deputy soon arrive at the accident scene. Johnson sends the deputy to dispatch the badly injured horse, and the resulting gunshot causes Burns to wince noticeably. Sheriff Johnson is asked to identify Burns as the escaped fugitive, but the sheriff declines claiming he's never seen him closeup. Burns is loaded onto an ambulance and driven away as his cowboy hat washes across the rainy highway."

Jigsaw,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056121/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A woman is found murdered in a house along the coast from Brighton. Local detectives Fellows and Wilks lead an investigation methodically following up leads and clues mostly in Brighton and Hove but also further afield. A woman's dismembered body is found in a trunk in the garage of a rented house in Saltdean, a coastal resort about 5 miles from the large seaside town of Brighton, which is in the county of Sussex in England. The discovery is made by police after the lettings agent for the property reports a break-in at his premises and the theft of the lease for it. The tenancy was for one month, taken out by a man called John Campbell, which turns out to be a false name. Identifying the man who took out the lease is therefore one strand of the police inquiry. It eventually leads to a vacuum cleaner salesman who is believed to be posing as John Campbell but this turns out to be a red herring. Identifying the woman is another strand, beginning with the trunk, which bears a label indicating it was sent from Lewes (an inland town in Sussex) to Brighton by rail, with the initials of the owner, J.S., written on it. The inquiries lead to a woman whose initials are J.S. and who lives in Greenwich, London. Her house is adjacent to the mooring of the original Cutty Sark. Her address was discovered through an impression on a notepad in the rented house; the writing became legible by heating iodine in a metal spoon and holding the paper over the vapor. The police believed this J.S. to be the murdered woman but she is very much alive and just happens to have the same initials. What seems at first to be another red herring turns out to have substance; although she at first denies it, when she learns that there has been a murder, she confesses that she did meet the man who rented the holiday home and called himself John Campbell - they got talking on a train to Brighton and she ended up spending the night with him at the house in Saltdean. She tells D I Fellows that one of the rooms was locked - the one where it is believed the dead woman's body was before being transferred to the trunk. The dead woman's identity is eventually established through investigation into dental records. D I Fellows arrives at the identity of the killer through a process of elimination, although he keeps this knowledge to himself; instead, he arranges for key witnesses and the unwitting suspect to be brought together, to prove his theory. Proving that the death was murder rather than the accident the murderer claims it to have been is down to D S Wilks and hinges on the fact that events unfolded over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend."

The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056194/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young thief takes up long-distance running when he is sent to a borstal. A rebellious youth, sentenced to a boy's reformatory for robbing a bakery, rises through the ranks of the institution through his prowess as a long distance runner. During his solitary runs, reveries of his life and times before his incarceration lead him to re-evaluate his privileged status as the Governor's prize runner. Nottinghamian Colin Smith is a sullen young man from a working class family. He, along with his friend Mike, commit petty crimes. Colin does so in an effort to escape his unhappy family life. He has a difficult relationship with his mother, especially in that she seemed to be more interested in the insurance money from his father's death than with his father as a man and husband. That fact is further highlighted by her taking up with another man immediately following Mr. Smith's death. Colin also distrusts authority. He is sent to Ruxton Towers Reformatory after he is caught stealing money from a bakery. His stay there is initially a difficult one until its Governor notices that Colin has a natural ability in long distance running, which Colin states was all in an effort to run away from the Police, who were often chasing him. The Governor believes running may be Colin's salvation to a better life, both at Ruxton Towers, and after his release. The Governor wants to cultivate Colin's running ability so that he will race for the school in the inaugural track meet against a public school, winning which will show the world the Governor being able to turn these boys into functioning members of society. Colin does take up the challenge, as running offers him a sense of freedom. Colin may use his running to demonstrate what he considers his ultimate act of freedom.—Huggo ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by ""The Governor"" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham. Without a job, Colin indulges in petty crimes in the company of his best friend, Mike (James Bolam). Meanwhile, at home, his father's long years of toil in a local factory have resulted in a terminal illness for which his father refuses treatment. Colin is angered by the callousness of his mother (Avis Bunnage), who he knows already has a ""fancy man"", and who Colin finds has neglected to give his father an herbal concoction for pain and, as Colin believes, brings about his father's death..Colin rebels by refusing a job offered to him at his father's factory and watches with disdain as his mother spends the five hundred pounds in insurance money the company pays her on clothes, a television and new furniture. When his mother's lover moves into the house, and after an argument when his mother tells him to leave, Colin and his best friend Mike (James Bolam) take to the streets. Colin uses his portion of the insurance money to treat Mike and two girls they meet to an outing in Skegness, a nearby coastal resort, where Colin falls in love with his date, Audrey (Topsy Jane), and confesses to her that she is the first woman he's ever slept with. She eventually extracts a half-hearted promise from Colin that he might look for work, implying his feelings for her are such that marriage is a possibility.But one night, while prowling the streets of Nottingham with Mike, the two spot an open window at the back of a building. It's a bakery, with nothing much to steal but the cashbox, which contains about seventy pounds. Mike is all for another outing to Skegness with the girls, but Colin is more cautious and hides the money in a drainpipe outside his house. Soon, the police come calling, accusing Colin of the robbery. He tells the surly detective he has no knowledge of the crime. The detective produces a search warrant on a subsequent visit, but can find nothing. Finally, frustrated and angry, he returns to say he'll be watching Colin. As the two stand at Colin's front door in the rain, the torrent of water pouring down the drainpipe dislodges the money, which washes out around Colin's feet.This backstory is interspersed in flashbacks with Colin's present-time experiences at Ruxton Towers, where he must contend with the jealousy of his fellow inmates over the favoritism shown to him by The Governor, especially when The Governor decides not to discipline Colin, as he does the others, over a dining hall riot because of Ruxton's bad food. Colin also witnesses the kind of treatment given to his fellows who are not so fortunate - beatings, bread-and-water diets, demeaning work in the machine shop or the kitchen.Finally, the day of the marathon against Ranley arrives, and Colin quickly sizes up who the school's best runner is (played by a very young James Fox) and who he must beat. With a proud Governor looking on, the starting gun is fired. Colin soon overtakes Ranley's star runner and has a comfortable lead with a sure win; but a series of jarring images run through his mind, jumpcut flashes of his life at home and his mother's neglect, his father's dead body, stern lectures from detectives, police, The Governor, the hopelessness of any future life with Audrey. Just yards from the finish line, he stops running and remains in place, despite the calls, howls, protests from the Ruxton Towers crowd, and especially The Governor. In closeup, we see Colin look directly at The Governor as a rebellious sneer plays on his face. The expression remains there as the Ranley runner passes him and crosses the finish line to victory. The Governor's anger is evident.At the end of the film, Colin is back in the machine shop, punished and now ignored by The Governor. But he seems calm, even content, because in the end, he refused to buckle under to authority and has settled into the loneliness of the title."

Advise & Consent,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055728/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The polarizing search for a new Secretary of State has far-reaching consequences. Robert Leffingwell is the president's nominee for Secretary of State. Prior to his approval, he must go through a Senate investigation to determine if he's qualified. Leading the Senate committee is idealistic Senator Brig Anderson, who soon finds himself unprepared for the opposition and political dirt that's revealed, including Leffingwell's past affiliations with a Communist organization. When Leffingwell testifies about his political leanings, he proves his innocence. Later, however, Anderson learns that he lied under oath and asks the president to withdraw Leffingwell from consideration, especially after the young senator and his wife begins receiving blackmail threats about a skeleton in his own closet.—Daniel Bubbeo <dbubbeo@cmp.com> When the President of the United States nominates Robert A. Leffingwell to the post of Secretary of State, it's left to the U.S. Senate to confirm that appointment. Leffingwell is eminently qualified for the post but is seen by many in both parties, especially Senator Seabright Cooley, as an appeaser and soft on Communism. The Senate Majority Leader, Bob Munson, appoints an up and coming young Senator, Brigham Anderson, to chair the sub-committee reviewing the nomination. The hearings soon becomes a communist witch hunt with Leffingwell denying any communist affiliations or leanings. When Anderson learns that Leffingham did in fact attend several meetings of a communist cell and lied to the committee, he refuses to support the nomination. That's when he and his wife start to receive phone calls threatening to reveal something from his past unless he supports the Leffingham nomination.—garykmcd The hot topic of debate within the United States Senate is the President's controversial appointment of Robert A. Leffingwell as Secretary of State, controversial even within the President's own party. The controversy stems not from Leffingwell's abilities, but rather his overly principled manner which has often gotten in the way of political expediency. As such, Leffingwell has in the past ruffled the feathers of some within the Senate, with some of those ruffled feathers being against the individual as opposed to his or her general ideals. Senior Senator Seab Cooley, a man fond of grandstanding to get his point across, in particular sees Leffingwell as a Communist sympathizer. But Leffingwell also has his staunch supporters, such as Senator Fred Van Ackermann who sees Leffingwell as the type of man needed to maintain peace in this era of the Cold War. Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson sees that getting enough votes to confirm the appointment may be a difficult task. He strikes a senate subcommittee dealing with Leffingwell's appointment and names junior Senator Brig Anderson as Chair, who Munson knows will follow his wishes in this matter. During the subcommittee hearing, serious allegations are leveled against Leffingwell by an outside source, albeit one orchestrated by Cooley and one with some perceived lack of legitimacy seeing as to the source himself. As the pro and anti Leffingwell factions strategize on how to deal with the allegations (some which include blackmailers digging up skeletons in one politician's closet), Leffingwell himself has to decide what to do in light of the truth and what may be best for his professional future and that of others involved.—Huggo A look behind the scenes at the wheeling and dealing that goes on in Washington to get things done. The ailing President nominates a controversial candidate (Robert A. Leffingwell) for Secretary of State. The film follows the public and private dealings as the Senate holds confirmation hearings on the nomination. Blackmail, smear tactics, political trade-offs and more highlight this movie. Senate majority leader Robert Munson of Michigan tries to steer Leffingwell toward confirmation, with his initial roadblock being Senate Pro Tem Seabright ""Seab"" Cooley-SC, a party member. But Munson bypasses overly-ambitious Wyoming senator Fred Van Ackerman to put Utah's Brigham ""Brig"" Anderson in charge of the committee vetting of Leffingwell. Cooley drags out an old acquaintance from the nominee's college days (Herbert Gelman) in an attempt to scuttle the appointment. Meanwhile, Van Ackerman sics a team of blackmailers on Anderson in an attempt to ensure the nomination, even though Anderson, Munson, and the president know Leffingwell has provided perjured testimony about his past. Anderson travels to New York and confronts his old army lover outside a gay bar, returning to the Capitol to slit his own throat in his Senate office. Chastened by Anderson's suicide, Munson and Cooley agree to disagree in a ""nice"" way, and the full Senate vote on Leffingwell's nomination ends on a 47-47 tie since Munson has shamed Van Ackerman into walking out of the chamber before his name is called to vote. Just as the voting ends, the Vice-president Harley Hudson, the Senate's presiding officer, is informed of the President's death. Knowing that Leffingwell has given false testimony under oath, Hudson refuses to honor his mentor's dying wish, and cast the deciding vote. Hudson leaves stating that as president-apparent, he'll nominate his own Secretary of State."

But soon Cinzia sees and hears strange things and feels uncomfortable at home. When Dr. Hichcock gives a glass of milk to Cinzia, she throws it off but keeps a sample in the glass. Then she asks her friend Dr. Kurt Lowe to analyze the milk, and he learns that there is a high quantity of poison. What will Cinzia and Dr. Lowe do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In 1885 London, the famous Professor Bernard Hichcock has created a new method of anaesthesia and has become rightly famous for it. A renowned, brilliant, and humane surgeon, he also happens to be a necrophiliac who enjoys sexual games with his beautiful and very willing wife, Margaretha. The games include slowing his wife's pulse with this anaesthetic so that she seems corpse-like. Sadly, one night, he injects her with too much and she dies in his arms. Devastated and traumatized, he resigns from his position and leaves England, the reason for his wife's death, of course, never publicly revealed. He returns twelve years later, remarried to Cynthia. His housekeeper, Martha, who was loyal to him and Margaretha, and even a devilishly delighted romantic co-conspirator in preparing the funeral-parlor-like room for their sex games, makes it clear that she views his remarriage as a betrayal: she treats Cynthia coldly and Bernard with scornful glances and without the familial devotion she showed before Margaretha's death. Cynthia starts to hear noises and a woman's threatening voice, and while Bernard initially dismisses her worries as paranoia, eventually discovers that Margaretha had not died but rather had been unnaturally aged and driven insane by the overdose and premature burial; apparently, Martha had saved her and has looked after her during Bernard's absence. Even in her ravaged condition, Bernard is still deeply in love with Margaretha, and conspires to murder Cynthia so he can use her blood in medical efforts to restore his wife's health and beauty. Needless to say, Bernard is thwarted, he and Margaretha dying in a conflagration at the end, while Cynthia is saved by Bernard's handsome young assistant. The subject matter of the film was revolutionary for its day and indeed for any period. The viewer is also asked to make some complex emotional and moral decisions: the real, and tragic, love story of the film is that of Bernard and Margaretha, but we must accept that his original error can only be undone at the expense of his dreary second wife's life. It is a brilliant film, certainly among the best Italian horror films and probably among the best horror films of any national origin. Most notably, the famous Barbara Steele is little more than a cardboard stock character as Cynthia. It is probably her least important role."

Freud,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055998/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An examination of Czech-Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud's career when he began to treat patients diagnosed with hysteria, using the radical technique of hypnosis. This pseudo biographical movie depicts five years from 1885 on in the life of the Czech-Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). At this time, most of his colleagues refuse to cure hysteric patients, because they believe they're just simulating to gain attention. But Freud learns to use hypnosis to find out the reasons for the psychosis. His main patient is a young woman who refuses to drink water and is plagued repeatedly by the same nightmare.—Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de> The story compresses the many years it took Sigmund Freud to evolve his psychoanalytic theories into what seems like a few months. Almost every neurotic symptom imaginable conveniently manifests itself in one (composite) patient, Cecily Koertner. She is sexually repressed, hysterical, and fixated on her father. And so Freud goes to work, developing one hypothesis after another. Also shown is Freud's home life with his wife Martha, whom he alternately discusses his theories with and patronizes when she reads one of his papers.—alfiehitchie The early career of Viennese based Dr.Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis, is presented. This phase of his story begins in 1885, when he is a researcher in a hospital under the direction of renowned Dr. Theodore Meynert. It is a time when scientific belief is that all human actions are conscious decisions, and anything that would be deemed abnormal behavior is classified as hysteria, the behavior a means to garner attention to oneself. After witnessing the work of Paris based Dr. Charcot - that work demonstrating that patients with hysteria under hypnosis may no longer display their physical maladies based purely on hypnotic suggestion - Freud, under the vehement objections of Dr. Meynert (despite an eventual admission by Meynert to Freud), begins to test his developing theories of a subconscious causing many of these maladies in patients with hysteria. Freud ends up being mentored by older Dr. Joseph Breuer, who not only allows Freud access to his patients with hysteria, but funds what will be listed as their joint research, but which is largely Freud's as Breuer is more the practitioner. Freud's encounters with two of Breuer's patients - Carl von Schlossen, who has delusions of having killed his military father, and young Cecily Koertner, who has a series of medically unexplainable maladies such as blindness and paralysis in both legs and who eventually falls in love with Dr. Breuer - prove both to be dangerous to their overall health and useful in the evolution of what ends up being Freud's controversial theory of the sexual mind in infancy - what is eventually coined the Oedipus complex - being the basis for many of the physical manifestations of hysteria. Freud's work places a strain on his marriage to his faithful wife, Martha Freud, who feels uncomfortable that the wives of his colleagues know more about his work than she does, and uncomfortable with the discussions he has with Breuer's patients about their sexual thoughts.—Huggo"

He wanted the vacation to be a romantic getaway for two, but Peggy insisted that it be a family vacation to a central California beachside house, given to them for the month by friends. The vacation included all their offspring, and their offsprings' respective families where applicable.

But beyond that, Roger ended up learning the true nature of his relationship to his offspring and to Peggy.

They claim he has used witchcraft, necromancy, seduced maidens, and a number of other items. It is even mentioned that they attempted to torture the Baron for previous acts, but he survived the torment without any repentance, leading to the current trial.After the reading of the charges, the inquisitors are incensed when a man named Marcos Miranda (Ruben Rojo) steps forward to defend the Baron, claiming him to be an honorable man. However, the Inquisitors claim Miranda is lying, and sentence him to be whipped.A few moments later, the men pass judgment, claiming the Baron's lands and possessions will be confiscated by the church, and he is to be burned alive. The baron claims he will comply willingly, but is able to use some sort of magic to remove his shackles, and walk out of the room.The Baron is next seen on a pyre in a field. A number of villagers (and even Marcos) are in attendance, as the pyre is lit. The Baron does not seem to feel the heat of the flames, but merely glances skyward, as a comet can be seen.As the flames climb higher, the Baron calls out each of the Inquisitors by name, claiming that when the comet overhead returns in 300 years, he will destroy the men's descendants.We cut to 300 years later, where Reynaldo Miranda (Ruben Rojo) and his girlfriend Victoria Contretas (Rosa María Gallardo) are meeting with Professor Saturnino Millan (Luis Aragon) to observe a comet through the local observatory. Eventually, the three locate the comet in the night sky, but Reynaldo and Victoria note something strange about it, and go off to investigate.unseen to them, the comet has dropped from the sky, and landed as a large meteorite in a field. A man in a car investigates, but as he watches, the meteorite disappears, and a strange creature emerges. It grabs the man, and it's long forked tongue hits the back of his neck, and the man goes down. After this, it is revealed that this creature is Vitelius d'Estera. After taking the man's clothes, he soon encounters Reynaldo and Miranda. When the conversation turns to the comet, the Baron mentions how astronomy and science are two things he excels at, and the young couple eagerly invite him to call on them and their friend, Professor Millan.After the encounter, the Baron materializes in a restaurant. There, he quietly observes a drunk woman, before turning into his creature form, and using his forked tongue on her.The next day, a coroner shows the body of the man in the forest, and the woman at the bar, to the Chief Detective (David Silva) and his associate (Federico Curiel). They find that both have two holes in the back of their neck, and that their brains have supposedly been sucked out through these openings. This puzzles the Chief Detective, but his only thought is maybe it was some sort of ""maniac.""Later on that day, the Baron finds information on the Inquisitors, and begins to work on tracking down their offspring. He also sucks the brains out of a streetwalker, leading the Chief and his assistance to grow more alarmed.Meanwhile, back at the observatory, Professor Millan is incensed that though he and his young friends observed the comet, a number of his colleagues from around the world have claimed they have not seen it! However, the mood is lightened when he, Reynaldo, and Victoria receive an invitation to a party that Baron Vitelius d'Estera is throwing.The party it turns out, is a cover for the Baron, who has also invited the descendants of the Inquisitors, of which Reynaldo and Victoria are. Up until this point, none of the guests have any knowledge about whom the Baron is, but by the end of the evening, almost everyone is enthralled with his company. During a lull in the conversation, the Baron walks off to ""take his medicine,"" but it actually appears that he has stored the brains of his past victims in a bowl, and is consuming them a little at a time to keep his strength.After the party, the Baron calls upon one of the descendants, Indalecio Pentoja (German Robles) . During their conversation, the Baron is informed about Indalecio's fascination with the Inquisition, and also meets Indalecio's daughter, Maria (Roxana Bellini). As they look over some of the Inquisition texts, Indalecio notes a passage that mentions a name similar to the Baron's, causing the Baron to claim Indalecio's ancestor Sebastian de Pentoja was one of the men responsible for his death. The Baron then turns into his creature self, killing Indalecio and his daughter, sucking their brains out, and then setting their home on fire.Next, the Baron calls upon Luis Meneses (René Cardona), who is the descendant of Baltasar de Meneses. the Baron claims he can help Luis develop new and better alloys to help his company, when suddenly, Luis Meneses freezes in place, due to the Baron's powers. He then attacks Meneses' wife (Ofelia Guilmáin) and sucks her brains out. Next, the Baron uses his powers, to have Luis walk over to one of his live furnaces, and immolate himself.The recent deaths have also brought the Chief Detective and his associate to the Baron's place, given the two recently-deceased couples were seen there last. The Baron claims he has no information to give the two, and they leave.Shortly after the encounter, the Baron is witness to the wedding of Francisco Coria (Carlos Nieto), and Ana Luisa del Vivar (Magda Urvizu). Later on that evening, the Baron shows up at their home, where he murders Francisco in the bathtub, and then kills Ana Luisa, whose Inquisitor ancestor was Álvaro de Contreras (Marco Antonio Arzate).Shortly afterwards, the Inspector and his assistant do some additional investigating...and begin to see links between those that were murdered, and had ancestors associated with the Grand Inquisitors of the past (how the Inspector came to this conclusion, we're never told). They eventually call on Professor Milan, to find out the whereabouts of Reynaldo and Victoria. After the Professor tells the two men that the young couple are at the Baron's for dinner, leading the two to head back to headquarters, before going to the Baron's.Meanwhile, the dinner is over, and the Baron requests Victoria come to his room to select a jewel, as she and Reynaldo are planning to be married soon.As they are taking awhile, Reynaldo begins looking around the Baron's main living area, and finds his dish with the brains in it!Meanwhile, the Baron confesses to Victoria who he is, and that though it pains him to do so, he must kill her since her ancestor Álvaro de Contreras ordered his execution.Victoria bolts for the room into Reynaldo's arms, but the Baron, now transformed into his creature form gives chase. He also lays claim that Reynaldo's ancestor was Marcos Miranda, who defended him against the Inquisitors, and as such, he is willing to let Reynaldo live.It is at this time that the Inspector and his associate show up with flamethrowers, burning the Baron in his creature form, and eventually, killing him. Thus, the reign of terror is over."

Five of his crew have to be replaced and at such short notice before the voyage begins there isn't much to choose from.

The SS Happy Wanderer will never be the same.—Simon N. McIntosh-Smith <Simon.N.Smith@cs.cf.ac.uk> On the latest sailing of the SS Happy Wanderer on its regular round-trip Britain-western Mediterranean itinerary, Captain Wellington Crowther is dismayed to see five new faces among the crew, he having surrounded himself with a crew of men he knows and trusts in his ten year career. A smooth trip is more important for his career on this sailing than usual as the cruise line is making the decision for the person to captain the new ship doing the high prestige Transatlantic sailings, some in authority who will use any excuse not to assign him in he being just a regular bloke. Those five are: First Officer Leonard Marjoribanks, ship's doctor Arthur Binn, ship's head cook Wilfred Haines, head barman Sam Turner, who may be the most problematic in not knowing how to make the Captain's favorite custom cocktail, the Aberdeen Angus, and the Captain's personal steward, Tom Tree. The five know the Captain will be keeping a special eye on them and that he will paint them all in the same brush if one makes a mistake to jeopardize his promotion, on which they would like to accompany him if he gets it. But the harder they try, the more they get him into a scrape. These problems are only exacerbated by issues which they themselves are facing. Haines, never having sailed, gets seasick if he can't see the water, the galley which has no windows. And two passengers traveling together, friends Gladys Trimble and Florence Castle, are on a specific mission to find Flo a husband. While fickle Flo goes through a myriad a men who she deems as that husband material, she overlooks the one who is in love with her, namely Arthur, who is too shy to let her know how he feels.—Huggo Captain Crowther (Sid James) has five of his crew replaced at short notice before a new cruise voyage begins. Not only does he get the five most incompetent crew men, including the first officer Majoribanks (Kenneth Williams), the medical officer Dr Arthur Binn (Kenneth Connor), the head chef Wilfred Haines (Lance Percival), the barman Sam Turner (Jimmy Thompson) & the captain's valet Tom Tree (Cyril Chamberlain), ever to sail the seven seas, but the passengers turn out to be a rather strange bunch too. The ship's crew includes Young Officer (Ed Devereaux) and a cook (Mario Fabrizi).The head chef is forever seasick. The first officer is late for duty on account of oversleeping, the medical officer is not very good. The 5 newcomers decide to try their best to impress the captain, as that would put them in consideration for a job on the new liner. But, even if one newcomer fails, all will be painted with the same brush.
The SS Happy Wanderer is the cruise ship and after this voyage, Crowther hopes to get a job as captain on a transatlantic ship, promising the crew members their jobs will be safe under their new captain. Starting off from England, the Happy Wanderer calls at unnamed ports in Spain, Italy, and North Africa before going home again.

Crowther orders several bottles of liquor in his office as he tries to guess the recipe by trial and error. Binn and Majoribanks think that the captain is drunk on the job and Binn announces to all the officers that Majoribanks must take over the ship. But that's when Crowther walks in fit and fine, and Majoribanks faints.Flo and Bridget get drunk and Gladys has to force Flo away from the bar. Flo runs into Binn on the way back to her cabin and has a dance with him, which the captain watches. He knows that Sam got Flo drunk in the middle of the afternoon and that's why she is dancing with Binn, who has eyes for Flo.Meanwhile Flo, who is looking for a husband, decides to go for the captain & makes strange cooing noises every time he is around. Crowther discusses the situation with his first officer Majoribanks, who convinces him that the captain's rough face has scared Flo. Crowther summons Flo to assure her that he is her friend, but is terrified to learn that Flo is infatuated with him. He wants nothing to do with Flo.Majoribanks turns psychoanalyst for the ship's officers, including the captain. He makes the captain understand that his deep-rooted dislike for the new hands is due to his fear for change & his love for stability. The captain appreciates this insight.
Meanwhile, ship's doctor Dr. Binn (Kenneth Connor) has fallen for Flo, but she wants nothing to do with him, so he serenades her with a song after leaving Italy (Bella Marie, sung by Roberto Carinali), which she does not hear as she is asleep.

It works and the confident Binn finally confesses his feelings to a gobsmacked Flo, who returns his affections.Crowther lets the five newcomers know that they have improved since the cruise began, simply by doing their jobs and not by trying to impress him. Crowther says that he wont taken them with him to the new liner but would recommend them to his successor on the current ship.
They learn that the captain has overseen the Happy Wanderer for ten years and decide to hold a surprise party for him, with the passengers. Haines bakes him a many-flavored cake and the barman cables the former barman for the recipe of the captain's favorite drink, the Aberdeen Angus.The party goes well, and Crowther gets his telegram telling him he has the captaincy of the new ship. He turns it down as he recognizes it does not have the personal touch of a cruise ship and prefers the company of his own crew."

In 1950, 28-year-old outlaw Salvatore Giuliano is found gunned down in a Sicilian courtyard. Little is as it seems. The film moves back and forth between the late 1940s, when Giuliano and other reprobates were recruited by separatist politicians to do their fighting, and the days leading up to and following Giuliano's death. After Sicily's self-rule is declared, will the outlaws be pardoned as promised? And why does Giuliano order his gang to fire on a peaceful May Day rally? Police, Carabinieri, and Mafia have their uses for him. There's a trial after his death: will the truth come out or does the code of silence help protect those in power?—<jhailey@hotmail.com> The body of Salvatore Giuliano is found in a courtyard in Castelvetrano on July 5, 1950. Various figures are in the courtyard as the head doctor shouts out his examination of the body. The carabinieri and press arrive.The action flashes back to 1945, as exposition explains the existence of a Sicilian Separatist movement that gained strength around the time the allies handed Italy back in Feb, 1944. They were known as the ""EVIS"" (The Sicilian Army of Independence). They enlisted anyone to terrorize their enemies, bandits, mafiosi, and Salvatore Giuliano - who treated the Italian police and carabinieri as occupiers. They also fought leftists, communists, etc., who were making inroads with the people. The action continues as the EVIS leadership seeks out Salvatore in one of his hiding places. Another name used for him is Turridu which was what he was known as to distinguish him from his father. They want to offer him the rank of colonel and the battle flag of EVIS. In addition, once independence is attained, his name will be cleared. He killed a carabiniere and went into the mountains when he was 21. Don Pietro di Borgetto tells the EVIS representatives that Turiddu (Giuliano) is expecting them. He gives an impassioned speech about Sicilian separatism with beautiful pans of a Sicilian landscape at twilight. A sequence shows how lithe and adept Giuliano's men are in town, sneaking about. At night, the police come out of a building in town and are shot down. Giuliano's men surround an isolated post and open fire on it. The men inside come out with their hands raised. We see Giulinano just at the edge of the frame for the first time. He is wearing a white shirt. Four policemen drive along the road and are fired upon. The jeep crashes. The survivors shoot back at their attackers.Action resumes in present day - The casket actually contains Salvatore - we are in the present day. A glib army officer gives an account of Giuliano's death, and the press is not placated.Flashback. Giuliano and his men were protected by their positions in the mountains. On the other side of Sicily, the eastern side, the separatists were easily defeated in 1946, although the head of Montelepre is still in charge. Giuliano's men see the arrival of military policemen in the town. They are there to find Giuliano. The townspeople go inside their homes and close their shutters. The carabiniere major goes to see the town's mayor. Two policemen begin patrolling the streets in broad daylight when they are shot down by automatic weapons fire, guerrilla warfare style. One of the policemen eventually dies. A curfew is declared. The soldiers are stunned by this early loss. The drummer goes through the streets announcing the curfew. The communication between the villagers and the bandits works with whistles and closing of shutters etc.,The next morning, we get our first shot of Gaspare Pisciotta, Salvatore's right-hand man in black with Salvatore in white on the top of the hill. Pisciotta is the ""Judas"" of the story, but that has not developed yet. The military police start marching up into the mountains, but are not good with the terrain, despite most of them probably being WWII vets. Giuliano's men open fire on them. The military guys soon retreat. They fire some artillery shells at the outlaws, but they just scurry into the hills.The town crier announces that the people have one hour to get their water and shop for food. Mostly women come out, but some older men too. Soon they are fired upon and they have to scatter - by whom I'm not sure.In May 1946, Sicily was granted its independence, although the independence isn't as great as one might assume. To this day they are an ""autonomous region"" with probably less freedom from Italy than a state in the United States has. It was really done to vent off the anger. The bandits are now in respectable clothes, who go to see a mysterious lawyer. They have a letter of introduction to him from another mysterious character, a prince. They believe that all of their crimes should be pardonable as political crimes, a strategy that will be in use at the upcoming trial. The lawyer says that Giuliano is still staying in the mountains. He says the separatists were never going to keep their promises to Giuliano. The lawyer says Giuliano was an idiot to believe them in the first place. Giuliano will be an outlaw in the streets until the police catch him.The outlaws are now in the business of kidnapping shopkeepers and merchants at the behest of the mafia. They kidnap a man. After the dissolution of EVIS some of the money would go to Giuliano, but quite a bit of the money went to the Mafia for ""protection"".The police continue with their random searches of people. They stop townspeople from taking water and food stuffs up to the mountains to the outlaws by confiscating the goods. They want to starve him out. He was being supplied by the desire for Sicilian independence, and now that that's gone, the police see him as a common criminal. The whistling signal in heard and relayed down to Montelepre. They are signalling the arrival of the troops. A man awakens Donna Maria, Giuliano's mother. She awakens her son. He gets up quickly and goes outside. He escapes with Pisciotta into the hills and they see the trucks rolling in. A little later soldiers go into the house. They also start rounding up a lot of the men in the town. Many of the women cry to see their men taken away. They want to staunch the flow of supplies to the town, and therefore Giuliano.The police gather the men in the piazza. They call out the names of quite a few of the townsmen. These people are going to Palermo. One of the men asks: ""Marshal, how long will we have to pay for the sin of being born in Montelepre?"" The other townsmen shout their approval of this observation.A woman runs down the streets of the town shouting ""murderers!'"" The police are informed that the women are rebelling and they take two squadrons to block of the main street going into the town square.Back forward in time The mother of Salvatore Giuliano moans over the loss of her son. The photographers take photos of her. The mother is allowed to see the body of her son. She cries over the body.Flashback 1947. In the first election for an autonomous Sicilian government, the People's party is victorious, espousing agrarian reform and the occupation of feudal land.Giuliano recruits a goat farmer. And, finally, he sends the shepherd out to fight alongside the others. The men learn that on May the first, May Day, tomorrow, they are going to Portella della Ginestra to shoot communists. Actually, to this day, it is unknown who ordered the massacre.The communists are having a big parade and a speech. All of a sudden gun fire breaks out coming from the mountains. The people start running for their lives. People are killed, including women and children. This incident sent a chilling message that no one was beyond the reach, even politically, of Salvatore.The shepherd is interrogated at police headquarters and issues firm denials that he knows anything, or anybody.Back to the present - after death. July,1950, Salvatore Giuliano's tombstone. His mother is paying respects at the tombstone. Police are seen going to Pisciotti's family home in the center of Montelepre.Flashback 1949 Pisciotti's mother is trying to protect him. The police search the house.Back to the presentThere is a trial held for those accused of killing communists at Portella della Ginestra. A large number of accused outlaws appear in court behind bars. The shepard testifies he knows nothing, and knows nobody. The next witness says that the police beat the confession out of him.The judge says it all started going bad on June 13, 1950 with the arrival of Giuliano's memoir in court in which he claimed that all the picciotti were innocent and their statements made under duress.With other outlaw witnesses, the judge asks them directly who fired the shots at Porto della Ginestra. One of the men says that when the time is right, he will talk. Later in the court case, this same man stands up and says he can name some names. In front of the judge he says he knows the names of three men. He is in violation of the code of omertà, or silence from the authorities. He was in an earlier scene performing a kidnapping. He heard the names from Terranova, who heard it from Giuliano. Terranova is called to the stand. When the cooperating witness gets back to the docket with the other defendants, they suddenly attack him. Meanwhile, Terranova throws himself on the floor and acts like he has gone absolutely bonkers. After considerable struggling, the court is finally brought back to order.Gaspare Pisciotta now decides to talk. He says the Giulilano memoir that the judge has is completely false. Giuliano was forced by the police to write it. He says in the false version of the memoirs, Giuliano omitted the names of the men behind the massacre at Portella della Ginestra, thereby destroying his comrades' lives. He says that's why he killed Giuliano. The real memoir, he claims, has the names of the influential politicians behind the decision to attack the communists.(Gaspare) Pisciotta also says that since 1947 he was a collaborator with the carabiniere. The police gave him a free pass to come and go as he pleased. He claims that all the defendants were loyal servants of the separatists and monarchists. And now the big politicians are all in Rome, while the little guys are all here. He says an unholy trinity was formed between the outlaws, the police and the Mafia. To prove it he asks the judge to subpoena Gen. Luca. On December 23, 1949, General Luca met with Giuliano. The carabiniere also contacted the Mafia and the two sides made an agreement to cooperate with each other. And now it's difficult, if not impossible, to determine what the Mafia was responsible for and what the carabiniere were responsible for.A man testifies that a high ranking police force officer (member of the commendatore) apparently offered to get Giuliano and Pisciotta out of the country. The fact that the memorandum was destroyed hints at a major conspiracy.Flashback. - A quick scene back in Sicily shows that the authorities had to cooperate with the mafia, working through an intermediary.We meet ""Nunzio Mirafiori"" in the screenplay, but probably a representation of Giuliano's treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, a mafioso. He talks with the marshal. He says Giuliano is becoming a problem for him and he will he provide the carabiniere with one of the four men around Giuliano, Franco Mannino. The four need to be gotten rid of before they can get Giuliano. Nunzio says that the carabiniere have to catch Giuliano.Mannino emerges from the mountains and is heading to down to meet some ""friends"" as he was told by the mafioso. The carabiniere officer is seen in the background as if from behind bars. He is grabbed by the outlaws and held. He spits in the face of the retreating Don Nunzio.Nunzio tells the marshal that now they need the other three and Giuliano. The marshal says he just may let Mannino go.Two of the men are lured into a way of hiding by the marshal to lure Giuliano out. They are suspicious, but really have no choice. The police marshal has to lock up the truck with the bandits away in the truck. Now he emerges from his house at night, where Giuliano is now dressed in dark clothing at the left of the frame. Nunzio knows that Giuliano dare not kill him because he is still behest to the mafia.Now a cut to Nunzio, demoralized and isolated in rock quarry, with Pisciotta cocking his rifle and laughing. But the don (Nuzio), turns him around with his eloquence. He convinces Pisciatta that Giuliano basically has his back to the wall, and the carabinieri are stronger than the police - his days are numbered, and he should betray Giuliano.A setup has been arranged so that Pisciatta can see the cabiniere arriving to capture Giuliano. At this point, he has decided to double-cross his leader.Guilano is visiting his attorney, De Maria, in Castelvetrano. He is portrayed as an owlish, intellectual type. He has provided cover for both of them. Pisciatta has decided to kill Giuliano. The carabiniere actually want him alive so they can immobilize him and get to the bottom of who was behind the massacre. Pisciatta calls out for Turiddu - (Giuliano's other name). Giuliano says he's not coming and gives Gaspare a note from an informer. The note says that Gaspare has made a deal with the carabiniere. Gaspare laughs and asks: ""And you believe it?"" - a very nervous and unconvincing laugh. Supposedly, in real life, Giuliano accepted this explanation and fell asleep.Outside the carabiniere have a diversion where they have to tell a man who has come out into the street to fan himself to go back into the house. He lights a cigarette, and three shots go off. The carabiniere rush over to the building. Gaspare comes out and says that Giulilano is up there wounded. De Maria is cowering at the top of the stairs. The carabiniere go in but find that Giuliano is actually dead. Now they wonder what are they going to do. They tell the landlord to get them Giuliano's clothes. They get the clothes and they dress Guliano in them. A military policeman drives Gaspare back, but Gaspare takes control and kicks the policeman out the the car. He proceeds on alone.The military police bring the body to the spot where it will eventually be found. They stage the scene carefully. Then one of the carabiniere fires off an automatic weapon toward the body. This provides an explanation for the opening scene of the movie, where the doctor is announcing the details of the body affirmatively.Present day At the court they ask the landlord of Giuliano if he knows where Giuliano's memoirs are to be found. The landlord says he knows nothing about the whereabouts the memoir. The judge wonders if Gaspare took the memoir from Giuliano.Gaspare speaks up and says that as of July 1950 Giuliano no longer had the memoir. It had been given to the man they called ""the little lawyer"". He also says he introduced the carabiniere to the little lawyer. There are references to ""the little lawyer"" that, to this day, are not explained. The carabiniere have the document now. Gaspare says he can't give the judge the name of the man.The court reaches it's decision on May 3rd, 1952, almost two years after the murder of Giuliano. A number of the defendants such as Gaspare, Terranova (Pisciotta's closest colleague), Mannino, Francesco Pisciotta, Cucinella and several more have been found guilty of the May 1, 1947 massacre and are sentenced to life in prison. Pisciatta gives an explosive speech where he yells about the injustice given to him because he saved the life of the carabiniere colonel.In prison Gaspare is poisoned to death, probably for collaborating with the police. One of the outlaws shouts out the news for everyone to hear that Gaspare is dead and the inmates make a lot of banging sounds to announce their approval.In 1960 Coda - Nunzio (in real life, probably Benedetto Minasola) is murdered at a horse market. A message that treachery will always be punished."

Suddenly before anyone can react Capella is destroyed with all hands by a stray meteor.
The crew of the Sirius are devastated by the news, and reflect on how close they came only to die within sight of their destination. A message received from Earth advises that a replacement for Capella is launching soon and will reach Venus in 4 monthsAlexi ( ) one of the crew from Sirius doesnt want to wait and suggests they modify the robot glider on Vega, so. Venus needs to be seen by human eyes. He explains if anything happens he will not call for help. His life is his, to do with as he desires.Mr Kern (Georgi Tejkh) On board Vega must have the final say on the launch. Rather than use the glider he recommends landing the two ships rather than wait for the spare ship from Earth, but first he has to check the figures for the safety margins. To do this he activates the ships robot JohnThe robot proposes a different plane. Three crew members go down in the glider, three more go down in the Sirius, leaving Vega in orbit manned by Masha (Kyunna Ignatova) Masha feels cheated by the plan but realizes it is the only way the mission can succeed As they plan to land a strange red light is seen through the cloud cover. They decide to try and land close to that position. It is decided the glider will go down first, and try and identify a good landing place. Sirius will followThe glider finds a location but as it drops the beacon to mark the spot for Sirius it is blown off course and heads for a dangerous landing in a swampy region. From orbit Sirius cant re-establish contact. Unsure what may have happened Sirius decides to land at the beacon and try and find the crew of the gliderThe Sirius lands successfully and begins testing the environment to see if they can go outside. Using an external microphone they listen to the sounds of Venus. At one point they hear what sounds like a womans voice singing. Understanding that little can be accomplished from the ship they decide to outside and explore.
As Alexi explores away from the ship he is attacked by some strange tentacle creature. The other crew dont realize the danger and continue to check instruments for signs of the glider. They discover two distinct signals. One they suspect is the glider, and one that is moving should be JohnFinally the others realize Alexis situation and rescuing him from the plant like creature. The creature responds by first releasing Alexi then encloses itself in a protective shellIn the meantime Masha has confirmed the other crew is alive and has pin-pointed their location, approximately 32 kilometers away. The fact John is active proves crew members must have survived because hed been disassembled for the flight downAt the other landing site Kern, working with the partially completed robot search for parts of the robot to complete the job of assembly. One of the other crew is firing ant strange reptilian creatures that keep attacking
Meanwhile the crew of Sirius have gotten their rover working and set off to help the crew of Vega. On the way they see a brontosaurs and stop to take a blood sample from the slow moving creature. While doing this, Masha confirms that the Vegas crew is moving towards the Sirius location.The crew from the Vega begin to feel ill and fevered, they are concerned that the rips in their suit may have allowed them to get sick from Venusians germs. The crews of the Sirius reach the shore of a large body of water and decide to cross it rather than go around. As they prepare to submerge they hear the same strange womans voice. Pausing to investigate, they find nothing and press onBack with the Vega crew they have been caught in a rain storm and John cautions that he may soon malfunction because of the water. Schebra (Yuri Sarantsev) Is clearing struggling to continue and Kern orders John to locate a cave so the humans can rest.John finds a cave and Kern and Schebra collapse delirious.

John then declares himself a free entity and slave to no oneVershinin (Vladimir Yemelyanov) realizes whats happening and instructs John to dispense a series of pills to the diseased crewmenThe crew of the Sirius comes under attack from a flying reptile. Despite hitting it with repeated rounds from their gun, they fail to kill it. In desperation they sink the rover. Masha is mortified. From orbit she thinks the rover has been destroyed, she makes the decision to attempt a rescue by landing the ship single handedly.
Before she can fire the engines to land, Earth contacts her and specifically instructs her to stay in orbit. She becomes confused and imagines a whole series of horrible deaths the combined crews could be suffering
Now on the bottom of the ocean the Sirius carry the rover along the sea floor. Stopping for a rest they become interested in a group of strange regularly shaped boulders. Investigating closer they become convinced that they are in some submerged city. The discovery of a statue seem to decide the answer for themMeanwhile the crew from the Vega have recovered from their fever and again begins moving to Sirius position.
At the same time the crew of Sirius make landfall, while they wait for the rover to become operational again they discuss the discovery of the statue, and the implications of the sort of society that may have created it
As they debate they again hear the voice, and seriously consider who it might belong too. One of the crew thinks that in the past Martians may have come to Venus to escape their dying world. He then thinks if Venus, why not EarthThe Vegas crew is now close to the red spot seen from orbit. They recognize that it nothing technological, but an erupting volcanoes. Finding themselves trapped by a lava flow, they ride from danger on the robot. Part way across the flow the robot becomes stressed and decides it needs to eject the extra weight of the men.
As the two men fight to save themselves the heat becomes too much for the robot and it short circuits. The other crewmen hear what is happening from the rover and rush to the rescue. Picking the two men up they watch from safety as the robot slowly melts from the heat.Later as the united crew take stock of their situation they again discuss possible evidence of aliens visiting Earth. One ponders what the woman with the strange voice must look like, is she beautiful, would she be even humanNow safe the combined crews spend their time exploring the planet and gathering samples. Although the radio has been damaged for some time they can receive messages.. Suddenly they get a message from Masha saying is going to attempt a landing. It is decided two of the crew will launch back into orbit leaving the others behind. An earthquake threatens to undermine the ship creating a sense of urgencyJust before launch they realize Masha has not tried to land and is still in orbit. Setting one last instrument before takeoff, one of the crew uses a rock they picked up previously. The rock shatters revealing a femine face with dark eyes carved into the other half. Alexi realizes he has been vindicated and the girl they keep hearing is just like humans.

The first woman is Sarah Garnell who is in a conventional twelve year marriage where her and her husband Frank Garnell's day-to-day lives overtake any notion of romance, which she still craves. As such, she, unknown to him, has fallen into the arms of another man, her community theater director, Fred Linden. In the process, she may mistake sex for love.

The third woman is Teresa Harnish married to Geoffrey Harnish, the two who like to think that they are the epitome of the textbook excitedly happily married couple.

As he begins to fall for her, Chapman's associate, Paul Radford, who conducted the interview with her and learned of her identity out of circumstance, tries to convince her that her inability to have sex with Boy was a manifestation of other issues in her life.—Huggo"

The vampire women in Mexico have awakened from their sleep, commanded by their master, The Evil One, to find him a bride. They choose as their target the beautiful daughter of a local professor. To rescue his daughter, the professor calls El Santo (Samson in some US versions), a silver-masked wrestler for justice.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> In The Forest of White Pine, a coven of Vampire women living in a castle, has awoken after a sleep of over 200 years.The first one to awaken, is Tandra,the Vampire Priestess, who must prepare to awaken Thorina, the Queen of the Vampire Women. 200 years prior, a woman chosen to be Thorina's successor escaped the clutches of the Vampire Women and their henchmen. That woman's beauty has now been passed down to a current relative named Diane, on the cusp of turning 21. Per a prophecy, Diane is to take Thorina's place as Queen of the Vampire Women, as Thorina descends into the depths of darkness, to be with her husband: Lucifer.Tandra and several male henchmen go to Diane's home and spy on her. The young woman almost falls under Tandra's hypnotic gaze, when her father, Professor Orlof, and husband-to-be, Jorge, console her.Orlof recommends that she lie down, and as Jorge leaves for the evening, Inspector Carlos comes by. Orlof has called Carlos to confirm that he will provide police security for Diane's birthday party in a few days, but despite this request, Orlof will not tell the Inspector just what he and his men are to protect Diane from.It turns out the Professor has known for some time (due to some old parchments), that his daughter is destined to become the successor to Thorina. A mark on her shoulder shaped like a bat, is also a sign of Diane's 'tragic destiny.' However, even with all this knowledge, Orlof has not told his daughter a thing about this prophecy.In the meantime, Tandra and her henchmen have attacked a couple coming out of a nightclub. The girl has been drained of blood, and her male escort has disappeared. Inspector Carlos is brought in to inspect the girl's body, with many perplexed about her bloodless corpse, until a doorman who saw Tandra turn into a bat and fly off, claims that the woman was attacked by a vampire! His declaration causes Carlos to declare the man be placed under arrest, feeling his claim to be ridiculous.Back at the Castle, the henchmen drain the kidnapped man of blood, and use his blood to revive the rest of the coven, along with Thorina.Back at Orlof's house, Santo arrives to speak with the Professor after being summoned. Orlof tells of the prophecy, and how Diane's relation many years before, was saved by a former relation of Santo. Like then, Santo is the only one who can save the woman destined to become Queen of the Vampires. Santo claims he will do what he can to protect Diane, but has to appear at a wrestling match.The day of the party, Inspector Carlos and his officers appear, and Orlof has the servants take extra precautions. However, their security does little, as Tandra and her henchmen manage to infiltrate the party, before Orlof identifies them. The two henchmen almost get away with Diane, before Santo appears, and fights them off.It is in the aftermath of the attack, that Orlof finally tells of the vampire prophecy. Carlos then formulates a plan: hearing that another couple was attacked at the nightclub like the previous one, he suggests taking Diane there with several of his men to see if the vampire women and their cohorts might show up. The inspector hopes the plan will allow them to catch the women, or even lead the officers to their hideout. Orlof wishes to go, but Carlos recommends he stay at home, in case Santo tries to call him.Back at the castle, Thorina is reprimanded by Tandra for failing to bring her Diane. Tandra then explains about Santo, and his possibly foiling the prophecy laid out.The vampires then send one of their male henchman to a wrestling match Santo is taking part in. The henchman takes out an opponent, and putting on his clothing and mask, attempts to take down Santo in the ring. The henchman's karate moves almost stop Santo, but Santo suspects something is amiss and manages to unmask his opponent, showing the henchman to have become a wolf creature! Several officers fire bullets at the man, but he turns into a bat and flies off.Meanwhile, Diane, Carlos, and several other officers are at the club, when Thorina and Tandra appear to take a look at her. Thorina leaves soon after, and Tandra and her henchmen manage to make off with Diane. Santo shows up too late to stop them, but manages to chase down one henchman, who bursts into flame upon running under the shadow of a cross.Carlos returns to Professor Orlof, and demands he quickly finish deciphering the parchments, feeling they have to tell where the coven is. With minutes ticking away, Orlof manages to find the location in The Forest of White Pine. Orlof radios to Santo, and the wrestler takes off for the castle.His attempts to infiltrate the castle end with him being trapped and tortured by the henchmen. However, Tandra does not act quickly in performing the ritual on Diane, and the sun begins to rise, burning the henchmen and Tandra, as well as sending Thorina and the other women to hide in their coffins.Santo manages to get free, rescues Diane, and burns the remaining Vampire Women in their coffins.Carrying Diane outside, she is reunited with her boyfriend and father, before Santo drives off."

A poignant comedy about a mute who befriends Nicole, the little daughter of a prostitute. Gleason shows his considerable talents as an actor without uttering a sound as he plays the bumbling, kind-hearted janitor, Gigot. Gleason wrote the original story and music for this film.—Charlie Watkins <watkinsck@msn.com> We begin with a cat on the streets of Paris who,after hearing the milk truck pass by, heads down to a basement apartment through a pet door and licks the face of the sleeping Gigot (Jackie Gleason), the poor mute janitor who lives there. He gets up, gives the cat some milk and then does his morning ritual of prayers, eating some bread and washing his face from water draining from a pipe.Two investigators from the Department of Complaints visit an old woman who called them. She complains that Madame Brigitte next door has hired a simpleminded janitor who steals her milk and ash can and sweeps leaves in front of her residence. She wants him committed. Gigot steps out and indeed sweeps up some leaves, careful to get each one and deposit them in the trash. He even stops to pluck dead leaves off the tree. The investigators nod and go in to start the paperwork.Gigot goes to Madame Brigitte (Gabrielle Dorziat) for his salary. She complains he hasn't earned it, but set the coins out for him then takes deductions for a broken window, messed up commode and even for replacing his worn-out broom. He leaves with just a few coins. Outside, mischievous men distract him so a kid can attach a tail to his back. The neighborhood laughs until a kind policeman removes it. Gigot goes to a pastry shop admiring the cakes, but just buys some stale, broken cookies. He mostly shares them with friendly dogs who follow him, and even gives some to a cat and a horse.Madame Brigitte tells the investigators that Gigot is as sound-minded as anyone else. She does admit he has a habit of attending other peoples funerals, helping the mourners mourn. Shortly after that, Gigot sees a funeral procession going down the street. He follows them and attends the service, comforting the bereaved and behaving reverently the entire time.That night, the same mischief-makers from before are at a bar. They see Gigot coming and decide to have some fun. They offer to feed him on the house, but first he must have a drink. Then one bets 5 francs he can't down a large glass of pernod without taking a breath. Gigot manages to drink the entire glass down. Then the bettor's friend insists he must have a chance to win back his money. So Gigot is conned into drinking a glass of eau de vie this time. When he finishes, he is drunk and loses interest in eating. Instead he pantomimes some of the people he saw at the funeral, and then stumbles into the next room where he begins to dance with a pretty girl. But the alcohol hits him and causes him to collapse against the wall. He gets up and humbly exits the bar. The patrons all feel bad for a few long seconds, and then go back to drinking and dancing.Gigot wakes up on the street in the rain hours later and begins to walk home. On the way, he spots a little girl Nicole (Diane Gardner) about 5 years old hiding under an archway. She backs away from him to another archway where her mother Colette (Katherine Kath) is also hiding from the rain. He takes them both to his apartment, sets out their wet coats to dry and gives them each a place to sleep.The next morning, the cat-waking cycle repeats itself, only the cat ends up licking Colette's face. She screams and scares the cat away. She tells Nicole they are leaving, but Gigot offers them some bread so they stay for breakfast. Brigitte comes down the stairs and finds them all, asking Gigot when he got married and telling him to get to work to feed his new family. Colette again says they must go, but finds herself still coughing from the effects of last nights rain and weakly crawls back into bed.Gigot is clearly enchanted with little Nicole and tries to amuse her with some sleight of hand tricks. When none of them work, he cuts a small piece of cheese and gives it to her. He then shows her a secret door leading down a corridor to another room. There he acts like a waiter, sets a table, and then has her put the piece of cheese on it. A mouse crawls from a hole next to the table and slowly eats the cheese. Nicole laughs uproariously and kisses Gigot on the cheek. Later he plays some records for her on an old gramophone, and dances to them.That afternoon, he takes her on a ride in a wagon. He is distracted by a passing funeral parade, and when he looks back Nicole is gone. Fortunately, she has just gone into the church next door. He goes in and tries to answer her questions about who the statues represent. Eventually, he is frustrated with his inability to speak to her and starts to hit himself. But she makes him stop and they walk off together.He takes Colette and Nicole to the amusement park. Colette stays on a park bench while they go on ahead. Nicole wants to ride the carousel. Gigot sets her on the horse, but he only has enough for one fare so he is not allowed to hold her as she rides. Instead he runs around the outside of the carousel to keep an eye on her, bumping into people and falling over hurdles as spectators laugh. She finally emerges from the carousel unharmed and asks to ride again.Meanwhile Colette, who is a prostitute, is approached by a customer. She pretends to be there alone and lets him make advances to her. When Gigot returns, he thinks she is being attacked and runs to defend her. He ends up being beaten up by the man and his friend until a policeman arrives to break it up. Colette tells the policeman Gigot is not her husband and she takes Nicole and runs off. When the policeman finds out Gigot is mute, he just sends them all on their way.When Gigot returns home, Nicole and her mother are still there, but preparing to leave. He indicates he is willing to pay them to stay (by pantomiming handing out money.) She gives him one hour to produce some money, or they will leave. He wanders the street and sees that the baker and his wife are distracted watching a painter. He sneaks in the bakery and steals a bag of money from the money box. He also takes some stale cookies, but leaves a couple of coins in payment.He returns to the apartment and shows Colette the money. She is impressed and declares they are going shopping. They buy Nicole some dresses, a new outfit for Colette and even a new hat and coat for Gigot. As they walk down the street in their fancy clothes, people speculate that he has a rich relative or won the lottery. They go to a restaurant and he flashes his money. They are given the best table in the house. Colette orders champagne and Gigot indicates champagne for all. The patrons are delighted. But later as Gigot dances with Nicole, Colette is approached by her former lover. He sneaks her outside and declares he is willing to take both her and Nicole back, despite claiming before that Nicole was a burden. She agrees to meet with him after Gigot falls asleep.Later, Gigot pays the bill and leaves the change as a tip. He takes his two guests home. Late that night, Colettes lover whistles for her. She comes out, planning to sneak back in and get Nicole. But he tells her tonight is just for them; let Nicole stay ""with the dummy"". From a distance, Gigot sadly watches them sneak away.The next morning, we again see the cat going to Gigot's apartment. But this time, no one is there. Outside, the two investigators arrive declaring they are going to have Gigot committed. Suddenly, Colette comes out of the apartment screaming that her child is gone and Gigot must have kidnapped her. The townspeople enter into the apartment and the baker finds his money bag and realizes Gigot is the one who robbed him.Meanwhile, Gigot and Nicole are actually safe in the secret room, where he is playing records on the gramophone and dancing. Suddenly, the ceiling collapses on them. Gigot emerges from the rubble and finds Nicole unconscious with a gash on the side of her head. He clears the rubble away and carries her out the back way unseen by any of the townspeople. He takes her to the church, where the priest sends for a doctor. The doctor treats the gash and says she is just shaken up. She murmurs ""Play the music, Gigot,"" over and over. Gigot rushes back to the room and retrieves the gramophone. Some townspeople see him and give chase. Eventually, he ends up near a coal refinery where he accidentally drops the gramophone onto a conveyor belt. He climbs on the conveyor belt to retrieve it, riding it up and then sliding down a coal chute into the river. Just then, a tugboat sails by right over the spot where he had fallen in. After it passes, only Gigot's hat floats to the surface. A townsman grabs the hat and declares that is all that is left of the man. Unbeknownst to him, Gigot is hiding in the water almost at his feet.The townspeople gather with Colette, Nicole and the priest and learn the whole story behind Gigot's theft and the apparent kidnapping. The priest assures Nicole that Gigot died trying to save her. Everyone feels guilty about how they treated the poor janitor. They decide since he liked funerals so much, they will throw him the biggest funeral the town has ever had.Later, they townspeople all gather for the funeral with lots of flowers, a hearse, and even a small band. Gigot sees the procession and follows at a distance, later hiding in a tree at the cemetery. It is not until the mourners start to speak that Gigot realizes the funeral is for him. Brigitte says he was a treasure who did the work of three men. The townsmen praise his drinking ability and the investigators claim they were always on his side. Everyone throws flowers on his grave, beginning with little Nicole. Then they slowly walk away. He climbs down from the tree and tries to signal them, but of course cannot. Just as he is turning to leave, one of the townspeople sees him and calls out to the others. Instinctively, Gigot flees. The movie ends with the whole town pursuing Gigot, who is unaware that now they all just want to be his friends."

Cute Disney fare.Brief OverviewWealthy sportsman James Haggin (Walter Pidgeon) lives on a Quebec estate called Wintapi. Émile Fornet (Émile Genest), handler of Haggin's hunting dogs, and Émile's wife Therese (Janette Bertrand), Haggin's cook and housekeeper, live in a separate house on the estate. To start a line of top show dogs, Haggin purchases the winner of the Montreal Kennel Club show, an Irish setter named Red. French-Canadian boy René Dumont (Gilles Payant) arrives at Wintapi on foot looking for work. He lived with his uncle in a cabin in the wild country and had no formal schooling. The uncle has died. Haggin hires René to help care for the dogs, especially Red, whom he expects to win the Westminster show in New York the next month. René is quartered inside the kennel.René and Red develop a special bond. The dog is too distracted by the boy to perform correctly for his owner, so Haggin moves Red to the main house until the show, and René is not to see the dog. Mollie, the mate selected for Red, arrives and is placed in Red's kennel. On the eve of the departure for New York, René sneaks to the main house to say goodbye to Red. Determined to follow the boy, Red crashes through a window and is gravely injured. Haggin orders the dog euthanized, but René sneaks Red away to his dead uncle's cabin and nurses him back to health. He returns the dog to Haggin. Red is scarred but still valuable for stud. Haggin wants to hire the boy back, but René finds work at the neighboring dairy farm.Haggin ships Red and the pregnant Mollie by train to Montreal to be sold. On the way, they escape from the baggage car into the wild. When René learns of this, he takes the train to where they were last seen and tracks them down on foot, reuniting with them just as Mollie gives birth to four pups. When Haggin learns that René has not shown up for work at the dairy farm for two weeks, he sets out on horseback to find the boy's cabin and learn what has happened. Man, boy and dogs are reunited in the woods, but not before Haggin encounters a cougar, loses his horse and gets trapped by a boulder. Red and René rescue him from cougar and boulder. Haggin proposes that René live with him at Wintapi and go to school. René accepts the offer, and they all walk back to Wintapi.Detailed SynopsisAt an outdoor dog show of the Montreal Kennel Club, a magnificent Irish setter wins Best in Show. Wealthy hunting-dog owner James Haggin (Walter Pidgeon) instructs his handler, Émile Fornet (Émile Genest), to buy the dog; Émile may go as high as $5,000 with his offer.The dog travels by train to Haggin's Quebec estate, Wintapi. René Dumont (Gilles Payant), a French-Canadian boy, arrives on foot at Wintapi carrying his travel bag with one hand and playing his harmonica with the other. He sees the Irish setter in its kennel run; boy and dog form an instant bond. The dog gets his left paw caught in the kennel fence, and René frees it. He enters through a gate identifying the occupant as Champion Redcoat Reilly of Wintapi, and the dog licks the boy's face in gratitude.Two gunshots are heard, and the dog bolts out through the open kennel gate and across a field where Haggin is hunting pheasant with Émile and two of his hunting dogs. Haggin wonders how Red got out and sends Émile after him. The boy also runs after the dog, slowing to speak in French to Haggin as he passes. Red scares up the pheasant and chases and corners it. René finds the dog first and uses his belt as a leash. He's taking Red back with one hand and holding his pants up with the other when Haggin stops him and asks, ""Just where do you think you're going with that dog?"" Émile catches up and translates the boy's French. René assures Haggin he was not stealing the dog. He was looking for the boss to ask for work. He speaks English, but when events move rapidly he cannot find the right words. Haggin allows that ""events are moving much too rapidly."" Learning that Monsieur is the boss, the boy introduces himself: ""Monsieur, I am René Jean Paul Dumont. I am a strong worker; I do not get tired. I have lived with my uncle who trapped the fox, but now my uncle is dead, so I must work. I am learning to speak English from a book, and I like animals very much."" He explains how the dog got loose after getting his left paw caught in the kennel wire. Émile checks the paw for damage, but there is none. Haggin gives the boy a job, and René thanks him: ""Merci, Monsieur le Boss!"" Haggin takes Red away, and Émile tells René to put on his belt so that his trousers do not descend.That night, studying from his book, René practices his English in his new sleeping quarters inside the kennel as Red and the other dogs watch. Émile comes in and checks on the boy. He describes René's duties and impresses upon him the importance of Red's care in particular. René is amazed that one dog cost $5,000. Émile explains that there will be a dog show in New York City the following month, and if Red wins this show, he'll be the best dog in North America, perhaps in the whole world: ""And that is what Monsieur Haggin wants more than any one thing."" As René prepares for bed, he says to Red: ""Five thousand dollars. It is an honor to sleep in the same room with such a dog.""Next morning, Émile is showing René the proper technique for brushing a dog when Haggin calls for him to bring Red outside. René makes a faux pas when he takes Red out through the swinging dog door between the inside kennel and the outside run. Haggin begins Red's training and says he'll be tough on him, as that Westminster show isn't so far off. Émile says he'll be all the tough judges rolled into one. When René objects to Haggin's harsh tone, suggesting he speak to the dog with gentleness, he gets a little lecture from Monsieur: ""A dog is an animal; he's governed by conditioned reflexes. Dogs ... don't have human reactions, and the only way to handle them is with a firm voice and a tight lead."" After Haggin departs, Émile advises René not to speak out to Monsieur unless he wants to join the ranks of the unemployed. He sends boy and dog off for a run through the fields but warns René not to let the dog off the lead. He adds, ""The next time Monsieur calls, the front door if you please?""Boy and dog run together through field and stream. As they rest, René gets the idea to help Red walk as Monsieur wishes for the show ring, but the dog is quickly distracted by a pheasant. René tells him he has much to learn if he wants to be a hunting dog for Monsieur: ""One does not become a hunting dog overnight."" A rabbit runs into a woodpile, and Red bolts after it. René loses the lead but catches up and tells Red, ""The rabbit, no; the pheasant, yes.""In the kitchen of the separate house where Émile and his wife Therese (Janette Bertrand) reside, René fashions a lure out of feathers while Therese prepares soup. He thanks her for the feathers and praises her soup, which he tastes, but he is too eager to go hunting with the big red dog to take time for a bowl of soup. She will save the soup till he comes back.René runs with Red on a long lead. Then he brings out the lure and places it in a bush. He shows the dog how to smell the air, advance slowly and point. Red does not understand (but jumps over René twice). René says he'll never be a hunting dog and tells him to go walk around in dog shows the rest of his life. But when Red nestles on the boy's leg, René accepts his apology and says they'll try again tomorrow.That evening after supper, René plays his harmonica as Therese washes the dishes and Émile smokes his pipe. Red lies under the table by René's feet. Therese and Émile join the music, singing ""Mon Amour Perdu"" (My Lost Love) in French. Therese says it's a sad song, but it makes her happy sometimes to be sad. Then René and Émile start a harmonica-and-spoons duet with foot stomping, and Émile and Therese dance. The revelry is interrupted when Haggin comes in--he noticed Red was not in his kennel. René explains that he asked to bring Red there because the dog was lonely. He and Émile leave to take Red back to his kennel, and Therese serves coffee to Haggin. She thinks the music was good for Big Red, but he is skeptical: ""Improved his coat, huh?"" She speaks of happiness on the inside showing on the outside; she thinks it's good the boy and the dog have each other. ""One should never be alone,"" she says, ""even when one has great wealth."" Her musings have shifted from the dog to its owner: ""One must forget that which is past; one must go forward."" Haggin responds good-naturedly, ""I should have gotten rid of you five years ago, before you learned to cook.""René loses his boot while running in the field with Red on the long lead. Sitting on a rock by the stream to put his boot back on, he sets the lure down on another rock beside him. The breeze blows it into the water. It drifts downstream past Red's nose as he drinks from the stream, and he follows it. It gets into fast water and he breaks into a run. René once again loses the lead and must run after Red. The stream comes to a man-made pool and waterfall with a flume leading to an empty mill. René enters the mill and sees Red below him through a crack in the floorboards. Descending to the level below, he finds Haggin picking what appears to be coarse, sticky sawdust out of Red's coat.René offers to quit ""le job"" and says he won't ask the full week of pay. But Haggin advises him: ""Never quit 'le job,' son. Just tell 'em you're unhappy and ask for twice the money."" René helps pick the debris off the dog. Haggin explains that Red is not like their other dogs; he's what is called a bench dog: ""His kind aren't used for any practical purposes anymore. ... Once his kind were great hunters, but they're so good to look at that the hunting points were bred out. ... They've lost their most important point--the sense of responsibility."" Red can still be ready for the dog show next month, and if he wins he'll be worth $10,000. Haggin shows René a photo of a female Irish setter: ""She's for him, to start the Wintapi Kennels, when he wins Best in Show at Westminster.""Walking home, Haggin learns from René that his uncle's cabin is 20-25 miles north. Haggin has hunted in that area and knows it to be pretty rough country. René never went to school, but his uncle taught him from books. Haggin stresses the importance of school. René agrees but says, ""For me now, it is necessary to work and make my way in the world."" Haggin says he won't get very far without an education: ""If you want to be a success ... make a lot of money ... that's what you want, isn't it?"" ""Oui, Monsieur,"" replies René, ""but most of all I want to be useful; that I think is the first thing."" Haggin has to agree.Spence Blake of the Montreal Kennel Club arrives at Wintapi to give his expert opinion on Red. (He was the Best in Show judge at the start of the movie.) Haggin explains that Red seems uncontrollable; he doesn't seem to want to perform anymore. Blake is puzzled: ""That's funny--an old trouper like Red."" It becomes apparent to both men that the dog is too distracted by the boy who takes care of him--except when he's on the lead with René. Haggin decides to keep Red in the main house with him until the dog show, and René is not to see Red for any reason. Haggin invites Blake to stay for lunch, and the two depart. René asks Émile, ""Pourquoi?"" Émile explains: ""Because that big foolish dog likes you too much. ... If he does not obey Monsieur he cannot win the show, and if he does not win the show Monsieur will sell him.""Red lies at his master's feet as Haggin sits reading by the fire. Therese comes upstairs to take away Monsieur's dinner dishes, and Red follows her to the landing, where she gives him a morsel from the tray as she descends. Then Red hears the boy's harmonica and goes to the window seat to look out. René lies in bed and plays ""Mon Amour Perdu."" He looks out his window and sees Red across the way, looking down at him sadly from the main house.Champion Ginger's Mollie O'Day arrives at Wintapi and settles into Red's kennel. Émile tells her: ""Mademoiselle, you are now at your own home--chez vous. If you wish for service, you have only to ring."" He tells René, ""With this one for Big Red, the Wintapi Kennel will be the best in the world!"" René is glum: if Big Red loses the showing, Monsieur Haggin will sell him, and then where will the kennel be? Émile: ""Monsieur Haggin is not a man who loses."" René: ""They are not judging Monsieur Haggin."" But Émile is confident Big Red will win. The departure for New York is scheduled for the following day, and René asks if he can see Big Red tonight to say goodbye: ""For ten minutes perhaps?"" Émile refuses: ""For no minutes. Red is now content, and he will remain so.""After dark, Red is again at the upstairs window as René stealthily approaches the main house. René peeks in the downstairs windows, and the dog comes down to look for him. They meet on opposite sides of the French doors, and René gets his chance to say goodbye, even though he cannot come inside. Then he runs from the house, but Red is determined to follow him. Haggin and Therese can't stop the dog, and he leaps through a window, breaking the glass and injuring himself. René runs back to him, and Red collapses. René embraces the dog as Haggin, Therese and Émile look on.Émile checks the dog on an examining table in the kennel. He shakes his head--the prognosis is grim. Haggin instructs Émile, ""Put him to sleep."" René pleads with Haggin not to kill the dog: ""Please, let me take care of him, Monsieur."" But Haggin is adamant: ""You don't want him to suffer, do you? ... Neither do I."" Haggin leaves and Émile goes into the adjoining room to prepare the injection. When he returns, boy and dog are both gone. With his jacket draped over the dog, René carries him into the wilderness.Therese gives Haggin a difficult time: ""Was it so bad--a boy who wanted to say goodbye to a dog? Oh, but I have forgotten--he disobeyed Monsieur, and this is terrible."" Haggin doesn't want to talk about it: ""Therese, it's over and done with, understand?""René nurses Red back to health at the cabin of his dead uncle. One day, Haggin is sitting in his yard preparing ammunition for hunting when an Irish setter comes up and sits by him. He wonders who let Mollie out until he realizes it's not Mollie but Red. René appears and tells where Red has been: ""Now I return him to you."" René has his travel bag, but he doesn't share Haggin's enthusiasm at his return. Haggin says, ""Tell Émile you're back, and I'll tell Therese you're hungry,"" but René says he is not hungry. Haggin praises him for the fine job he did restoring the health of a dog that was practically dead: ""Let Émile see this; he'll never believe it."" Red's as good as new, says Haggin: ""He'll take that New York show next year."" But René says, ""No, Monsieur""--Red has a scar that ruins him for showing. Haggin says he's still valuable for stud and reminds René, ""Never quit le job."" But René thinks it would be better if he found other work. Haggin says, ""I feel I owe you something,"" but René replies, ""You owe me nothing, Monsieur."" Haggin reluctantly concedes the point: ""Okay."" René cements it with his own ""okay"" and starts to leave, but Red follows him and tugs at his hand. He tells the dog in a firm voice to go back. Red does so reluctantly and sits beside his owner. René walks and then runs away.Red and Mollie are housed together; Red is disconsolate. Haggin arranges over the phone to have both dogs sold. He is shipping them that morning to a man named Jim. He tells Jim that Mollie will be having Red's pups in a couple of weeks--Jim can keep one if he likes and sell the rest. Then he adds, ""No, no, I don't think so,"" apparently on the question of Jim's holding back a pup for him. Therese has been dusting noisily, and Haggin hangs up and says, ""No comments, Therese."" She replies: ""What is to comment? ... After all, a dog is only an animal. ... And if the dogs remind one of a certain person, that is unfortunate."" Haggin reiterates, ""The dog is a closed subject,"" and leaves. Therese picks up a framed black-and-white photo of a young man in uniform and says to herself, ""There are many closed subjects in this house; I know that.""Red and Mollie travel by train through the Canadian wilderness. They are together in one crate in the baggage car. The baggageman (Georges Bouvier) puts down a pan of water for them, but they can't reach it through the bars. He removes the lock on the door of the crate, and just then the train makes a sudden stop. He steps off the train to investigate. When he is gone, Red pushes open the door of the crate and goes to the open door of the baggage car, where Mollie joins him. There is a moose on the tracks. The baggageman has a remarkable talent that he has used before, and he is pressed into service again: he does a male moose call that lures the female off the tracks. When the train starts moving, Red and Mollie jump to freedom in the wild. The baggageman runs and jumps aboard the back of the moving train. The moose watches the train recede into the distance; Red and Mollie do the same.René searches on foot for an errant cow. She's a big, gentle Brown Swiss dairy cow, and he finds her just over a broken-down spot in the split-rail fence around Wintapi. He points out to her that she's trespassing on the private property of Monsieur le Boss: ""This is not permitted."" She lets out a loud moo, and he laughs. Haggin happens by just then in a one-horse carriage and asks, ""Your cow, René?"" René replies that she belongs to the farm of Monsieur Mariot, where he is working now. He starts to take her away but comes back and asks: ""How is he, Monsieur? Is he well, Big Red?"" Haggin informs him that Red and Mollie ran away over a week ago. They were being shipped to Montreal for sale and got out of the baggage car. It was up in the Laurentians. He notified the forest rangers, but there's not much chance of finding them: ""Two kennel-bred dogs wouldn't last a week in that wild country. ... I'm as sorry as you are."" René replies, ""I can understand, Monsieur; it is too bad to lose all that money."" Haggin departs without another word.René takes the same train to the spot where it stopped for the moose. He rides in the baggage car, and the same baggageman thinks his search will be impossible. But René's uncle taught him how to track fox and wolf: ""A dog is no difference."" When they reach the place, the baggageman wishes him ""bon chance,"" and he sets off on foot with rifle and backpack.Red and Mollie climb the rocks beside a magnificent waterfall with multiple cascading levels. Red hears René playing ""Mon Amour Perdu"" on his harmonica in the distance. At the top, Mollie finds a cave in which to have her pups, and Red helps her prepare a depression in the floor of the cave. Then he runs down to René's campsite. After a joyful reunion, René gives Red smoked meat from the farm of Monsieur Mariot. As hungry as Red is, he takes the meat to Mollie and leads René to the cave where she is giving birth. They arrive just in time for René to present Red with his firstborn. In the morning René names one of the four pups 'Tit Rouge (Little Red) and tells Mollie that when they are big enough to travel, they will all go home. But that will be a while, and he and Big Red will hunt and bring them good things to eat.Haggin is bringing in his morning newspaper when he finds the same cow again on his property, eating one of his bushes: ""Good morning, madame. How are you? I wish you'd eat your breakfast elsewhere."" It appears she broke through the fence again. Dairy farmer Mariot (Doris Lussier) arrives on horseback and observes, ""This is not a very strong gate, Mr. Haggin."" He worries the bush might poison his cow, ""to say nothing of spoiling her milk."" It's possible he'll have to take steps: ""In our province both the rich and the poor are equal before the law."" Haggin says he thought the young boy René was tending the cow for him, but Mariot says the boy is no longer in his employ because he has not chosen to come to work for two weeks now: ""Perhaps he has gone to that cabin of his uncle to sit all day and play the harmonica. ... And if this cow gets away again, I'll have a good idea where to place the full responsibility, sir.""Early next morning, Therese is packing provisions into saddlebags when Émile comes down and asks what she's doing. It's for Monsieur Haggin, she explains. He is going into the woods to hunt--for one medium-size boy. He's going to the boy's cabin to see what has happened. Émile is surprised--only yesterday Monsieur said he was closing Wintapi to travel to Europe. Émile starts to go get his things, but Therese tells him he is going nowhere: ""This is a journey of the emotions; there is no room for two.""Haggin travels through the woods on horseback. René travels through the woods on foot with Red and Mollie--and the four puppies in his backpack. When Red spots a deer and chases it off, René remarks that Red loves to hunt but never catches anything. Haggin's path crosses that of a cougar, and his horse is spooked. He tumbles off the horse and down a steep slope into a ravine. The horse runs off. Haggin's foot is trapped under a boulder. The boulder won't budge; his rifle is just out of reach; he's at the mercy of the cougar. With his belt he tries to lasso the rifle, but he grabs a rock when the cougar drops from sight and he hears something approaching. Red appears; the cougar reappears. Red holds the cougar at bay until René and Mollie catch up. The cougar lunges from a high rock, but René shoots it in midair and it falls dead. René uses a limb for leverage against the boulder to free Monsieur. Haggin says he was wrong about Red: ""I said he was irresponsible, but he was ready to get himself killed for me.""Then René has something he wishes to say: ""I have made many mistakes, Monsieur, and those mistakes were by my own foolishness. I have caused Monsieur much trouble. ... Would Monsieur want me in his employ again, perhaps?"" But Haggin has a better idea, one he figured out on his ride up there: ""You'll live with me at Wintapi, and then you'll go to school."" René is reluctant to accept such a generous offer, but Haggin explains it's an arrangement where both parties benefit--he cares for the boy: ""I came up here because I was worried about you."" René says: ""There is nothing I would like better in the whole world than to stay with you at Wintapi and go to school. Okay?"" Haggin says, ""Okay!"" He needs help walking with his injured foot: ""You tell me if I lean too heavily."" They walk back to Wintapi with Haggin limping all the way and leaning on René. By the time they get back, the four puppies have grown enough that they run ahead of the others."

Will he be able to keep his promise in the end? Zé-do-Burro has only one worldly possession, his donkey, that he named Nicolas and considers to have a sole like himself, a law abiding Christian just a trifle naive. During a tempest, Nicolas is seriously wounded, and Zé-do-Burro, out of despair, makes a promise: to carry a cross as large as Christ's, to the altar of Saint Barbara - the nearest being in the city of Bahia. He vows to do so in a Candomblé session, dedicated to the goddess Yansan - that in the popular belief corresponds to that Christian saint. Nicolas fully recovers from his illness, and Zé-do-Burro produces a large cross with his own hands and tools, and then carries it on foot to Bahia, accompanied by his wife, Rosa. He has to stay by the church's closed door, and the only person who comes to meet them is Bonitão, the local pimp, who offers to take Rosa to a pension while Zé-do-Burro keeps his promise of staying by the cross. Next morning, the priest is surprised but satisfied with the faith shown by Zé-do-Burro - until the detail that the promise had been done in a Candomblé session comes up in conversation. Then, Olavo the priest berates Zé-do-Burro for his impiety, and forbade him entrance to the church. The local zealots back him up. A crowd is gathering for the procession and feast in honor of Saint Barbara, including Rosa, who is soon attacked by Marly, the local whore, out of jealousy of her having stayed the night in the company of the handsome gigolo.

A scandals' reporter adds to the confusion with his insinuation that Zé-do-Burro may be a communist agitator, or a blessed man. The police is called by the zealots, because Zé-do-Burro tried to force the door to the church using the cross as a battering-ram. The police officers order Zé-do-Burro to go away from the church, but he faces up to them. There's a brawl, a shot is heard, the people escape this way and that, and Zé-do-Burro lies dead by his cross. It's then that the black people take Zé-do-Burro's body, put it on the cross, and carry him inside the church to the altar of his favorite saint - unopposed.—Artemis-9 Zé is a very poor man from the Brazilian countryside.

A Monkey in Winter,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056636/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Albert is an inn owner who vowed never to drink again if he and his wife survived the war. They did, and the reformed alcoholic keeps his vow. But times have changed and soon after the war, Albert comes in contact with Gabriel, a young man prone to heavy bouts with the bottle. Gabriel is conflicted over visiting his young daughter in a nearby school and in a moment of nostalgia, Albert takes off with him on one major binge -- and havoc results.—EuropaCorp 1944 in the small town of Tigreville on the coast of Normandy, in France. A large troop of German soldiers is watching the place. But, on the top of a hill near the beach, two Frenchmen are drinking in a bar with a fake Chinese look. The place is actually a brothel run by Georgina (Hella Petri) who is definitely not Chinese !The two men, in their forties, are Albert Quentin (Jean Gabin) and Lucien Esnault (Paul Frankeur).When Georgina enters the bar, they are already very drunk. She asks them not to mess everything as they apparently did the last time they were drunk. When he is drunk, Albert thinks he is back in China, where he was a sailor in the French Navy. He talks, with a certain nostalgia, about the Yang-Tse-Kiang (or Yangtze River), and his life in China.But they are interrupted by the sirens. Allies planes are flying over Tigreville. All the German officers, who were in the hookers' rooms on the first floor, run down the staircase, with Albert making fun of them.Albert and Lucien walk out of the bar, and hide to avoid the bombs dropped by the planes. When the bombing slows down a bit, they start walking downhill toward the town, to their homes and their wives.The town is in a bad shape : it has been hit by a lot of bombs, and many houses are in ruins. Albert and Lucien cross the town.Later in the night, Albert, still drunk, is hiding in the cellar of the small hotel, the «Stella Hotel», which he owns with his wife Suzanne (Suzanne Flon). He is looking at the German troops running around in the street through the open window, and sings «It's a long way to Tipperary». Suzanne is a bit worried about this provocative attitude, but Albert keeps on drinking and even laughing when a bomb, falling nearby, sends a shower of plaster from the ceiling.But another bomb shuts the light off, and, in the dark, Suzanne starts crying. Albert lights a candle, and promises Suzanne that, if their hotel is not broken down by a bomb, he will never drink anymore.Fifteen years later, the war is long over and the «Hotel Stella» is working again.We are October 28, it is raining and one lonely passenger, Gabriel Fouquet (Jean-Paul Belmondo), comes out of Deauville train station. He takes a taxi to Tigreville and asks the driver about a hotel in the town. The driver tells him that, at this time of the year, the only hotel still open is the «Stella Hotel».When they reach the hotel, all the lights are out, and they have to wake up Albert, who gives room number eight to Gabriel. Gabriel asks him about a drink and Albert answers mineral waters. Gabriel doesn't want them and Albert goes back to his own room, where Suzanne asks him questions about Gabriel. Albert doesn't answer and goes back to bed. But, a minute later, he has to get out of bed, because Gabriel is walking downstairs.Gabriel is evidently looking around for a drink, but finding nothing, walks out of the hotel.He crosses the street to the «Café Normand», a bistro owned by Lucien Esnault. Inside the café, there are still quite a number of customers, mostly men and mostly sailors. He asks Simone, the waitress (Anne-Marie Coffinet), for a «Picon-Bière», an old fashioned mixture of beer and bitters. Then he asks her for a number in Madrid. Lucien, who was eating with his wife, comes to the bar to ask the number to the operator.While they are waiting for the operator to call back, the two men start drinking together, and Gabriel asks Lucien about Albert. Lucien explains that Albert used to be a heavy drinker, and that, all of a sudden, for an unknown reason, he stopped drinking. And more, he also stopped talking to Lucien and to all their other mutual friends. The customers of the bar explain to Gabriel that Albert is a very strange man indeed, who reads books from poet like Appolinaire, and did his military service in China. One of the customer, an old man wearing a beret (Lucien Raimbourg), is even more talkative than the other ones.The telephone rings. Lucien answers it and gives it to Gabriel who listens to his girlfriend Claire talking, but doesn't talk to her, and eventually puts the phone down on its hook.Meanwhile, Albert is watching the «Café Normand» from his window. He tells Suzanne Gabriel went there to find what can't be found in their hotel anymore. And then he says he doesn't mind because he has his candies to replace alcohol, but nevertheless he gives a long nostalgic look at the picture of himself as a sailor in China.Slightly later, in the «Café Normand», Gabriel is very drunk. He keeps on drinking and hardly listens to the jokes around him, among them one from a very old lady, Joséphine (Hélène Dieudonné), who tells the customers how, during the war, she wrote the Kommandantur about all the «bad people» in Tigreville. But, when he hears some men calling Tigreville the Norman California, he stands up and tells them they don't know a thing about what sun really is. He jumps on a table and starts dancing a flamenco.Actually when he is drunk, he thinks he is a Spanish toreador. After his dance, he starts breaking the glasses and Lucien kicks him out of the bistro. He stumbles a few steps in the street, and then falls down and remains lying in the middle of the street. Lucien sends the old man with the beret to help him.The old man helps him to stand up and then brings him to the door of the hotel, which Gabriel thinks to be the Madrid train station. Inside the hotel, he tries to climb the staircase to his room, but falls down and wakes up Albert and Suzanne. Albert walks downstairs to help him up the stairs, and then into his room.Inside his room, Gabriel wants to invite Albert to a last drink, but Albert tells him he doesn't drink. Gabriel tells him about Madrid and Claire, his girlfriend who has left him. Then he takes a tablecloth and mime a toreador fighting a bull. Albert watches him with a strange look on his face, and tells Gabriel he knows all about if. He explains that he used to drink, and when he was drunk, he would be back in China on the Yangtze river. But Gabriel falls asleep and Albert leaves the room.Next morning, on the fishing-harbor of Tigreville, Albert is buying fish for the restaurant of his hotel, when he meets Lucien, who complains about Gabriel breaking twelve glasses in his bistro. Albert answers that Gabriel is not an average drunkard, like the usual customers of Lucien's bistro, but a prince among the drinking people, someone an asshole like Lucien is unable to understand. In a last gesture of anger, Albert buys all the fishes the fisherman is selling, so that there won't be any left for Lucien.Meanwhile, in the hotel, Marie-Jo, waitress and chambermaid (Geneviève Fontanel), is bringing the breakfast tray in Gabriel's bedroom. But Gabriel is not hungry, and asks about Albert's reaction to what happened during the night. Marie-Jo answers Albert has not talked about it.Downstairs, in the dining-room, Suzanne is very surprised by the amount of fish bought by Albert. Gabriel enters the room and wants to apologize for the noise he made during the night, but Albert doesn't want to hear about it. Then Gabriel remembers something Albert said about the Yangtze river. Gabriel walks out of the hotel, but Suzanne, worried about Albert mentioning the Yangtze, follows Gabriel.She catches up with Gabriel and tells him that, talking about the Yangtze is bad for Albert. But Gabriel answers that he doesn't care about China, being only interested by Spain. Then he asks her where he could buy clothes for a child. She tells him to go to «Le Chic Parisien», a shop owned by a man nicknamed Landru, because of his beard and the fact that both his wives are dead.Actually Landru is not only selling clothes in his shop, but many other different things, like beach items, toys, postcards, carnival masks, gardening equipment, etc. Gabriel asks him for a sweater for a ten-year old girl, and Landru shows him what he claims to be a unique sample, designed especially for a very famous dwarf artist, who never came to get it. When Gabriel inquires about the numerous boxes of fireworks piled up in the back of the shop, Landru tells him they were ordered by a American millionaire in love with the dwarf artist.Gabriel, with the sweater wrapped in a parcel, walks to a boarding school for young girls, the «Cours Dillon», where he meets the old man with the beret, who helped him, the night before, to go back to his hotel. He asks the man, who works in the place as a handyman or odd-job man, to give the sweater to a young girl, but the man doesn't want to take it, and Georgette (Marcelle Arnold), who works as a nurse in the school, takes Gabriel with her inside the building.There, he asks her to give the parcel to Marie Fouquet, pretending he is not the girl's father but a remote cousin ! They are interrupted by the arrival of Madame Victoria (Gabrielle Dorziat), the director, on her wheelchair. Even though she is hundred percent French, she talks only in English, because it sounds better for the snobbish parents of the school. She asks Georgette to go and fetch Marie, and wheels out of the room.But when Marie Fouquet (Sylviane Margollé) rushes downstairs with the open parcel in her hands, her father is already gone.In the evening, Albert and Suzanne are in the cellar, checking the stock of wines. Suzanne tells her husband she has the feeling he is not quite the same since Gabriel's arrival. He gets slightly mad at her and then he reassures her : he is still not interested by alcohol, because he has his candies.They walk upstairs, where they found Gabriel on the phone, explaining new projects to his partner. Gabriel is in the advertising business. Then he goes to his table in the dining-room. Actually, he is the only customer, the other table, at the other side of the room, being occupied by Albert and Suzanne. Suzanne asks him to join them at their table. Albert gets a bottle of good wine for him and Suzanne, but does not share it with them.Next morning, Albert and Gabriel are on the beach, collecting shellfishes for the paella Gabriel wants to cook for his hosts. They talk about Gabriel's alcoholism, which is apparently one of the reasons why Claire left him. Then Gabriel tells him about his daughter, and Albert, who never had a child, tells him he should take care of her.As they walk on the beach, the little girls from the Cours Dillon come in to play. Albert, before leaving, tells Gabriel to go and try to talk to his daughter. The girls start playing hide-and-seek, and Gabriel hides in a disused German blockhouse to watch them. His daughter Marie is left alone on the beach, eyes closed, while the other girls are hiding. Two girls hide in the blockhouse, even though it had been forbidden by the teacher in charge of the group. Gabriel, hidden a bit further in the blockhouse, hears the two girls discussing Marie, and saying nothing but naughty things about her.In the evening, Albert, Suzanne and Gabriel are gathered around the dinner-table and have just finished eating Gabriel's paella. Suzanne has drunk too much white wine and wants to show Gabriel Albert's collection of train-timetables. And Gabriel learns that Albert is leaving the following day in the evening to go to his parents' grave. He seems a little sad about it and tells his host he wants to go out for a little walk.Next day is an unusual busy day for the season in Tigreville. There is going to be a celebration and many tourists, English, American and German, are coming into the town. It is lunchtime at the «Hotel Stella» and the dining-room is crowded. Suzanne tells her husband that she hasn't seen Gabriel yet, but Albert doesn't seem to care, until the old man with the beret comes in and tells him there is a serious problem with Gabriel.Actually, Gabriel is completely drunk and he is standing in the middle of the road at the entrance of the town, playing the toreador, with his jacket as a cape, and the cars as bulls to fight. Fortunately, the cars have succeeded so far in avoiding him. A crowd is gathered around him, seeming to enjoy this unusual show. Albert walks in, and takes him away.They both enter the town by the main street, followed by the crowd. When they reach the gendarmerie (a sort of local police station), Maurice (André Dalibert), the brigadier, (or sergeant), who is a long-time friend of Albert, takes Gabriel inside the station, and Albert follows him. Albert explains to Maurice that Gabriel has just drunk a bit too much, and that he, Albert, is going to take him back to his hotel. Maurice agrees to let Gabriel go if Albert promises he won't cause any more trouble.Outside, Gabriel is a little less drunk and starts feeling ashamed of himself. He wants to have a last drink and Albert takes him to the «Chinese» bar where he uses to go fifteen years before. Georgina is still in charge of the bar and she seems very pleased to see Albert after all these years.Hours later, dinner is over in the restaurant of the Stella hotel, and Suzanne is still waiting for Albert to come back. Marie-Jo has been looking everywhere for him but hasn't found him.Actually Albert is still drinking with Gabriel in the «Chinese» bar and they are both very drunk. Albert is drunk enough to be a sailor in the French Navy based in China, and Gabriel is drunk enough to be in the bullring in Madrid. Albert pays for the drinks and they both go out.They start singing and dancing down the hill from the «Chinese bar», and they are still singing and dancing when they reach the street where the Stella hotel is located. Suzanne is in bed but she doesn't sleep and she recognizes her husband's voice.Albert and Gabriel enters Lucien's bistro and walk to the counter to order Calvados (a hard Norman liquor made from apple juice). Albert comes to greet them with open arms, but Gabriel pretends not to know him. When Lucien starts insulting Gabriel, Albert gives Lucien a good punch in the nose. Lucien falls down on the floor, and his wife wants to call the police. Albert and Gabriel walk out of the bistro without paying for their drinks.Outside, Albert wants to bring Gabriel to his parent's grave, but Gabriel answers he has to get his daughter first, because he knows she is not happy at the Cours Dillon. Albert agrees to go with him and they start singing and dancing again in the street, but are interrupted by angry neighbors.When they arrive at the Cours Dillon, Gabriel wants to climb the gate to get in, but the gate is not locked. They walk to the main building and ring the bell to wake everybody up. Georgette opens the door and seems shocked to see that Albert has been drinking again after all those years of abstinence. Albert explains, in military language, that he wants Marie Fouquet with her suitcase within the following five minutes. The director, Madame Victoria, comes in on her wheelchair and tells them that Marie will be brought to them in the morning, when they are in better shape.They leave the building and, in the park, they look at the night sky and wish they had some colors to paint it. Then Gabriel remembers about the fireworks in Landru's shop.Landru agrees to sell them his fireworks, but he wants to come with them to help them using them. They load all the boxes on a cart and pull it toward the beach, where they start setting the fireworks, which wakes up the whole town of Tigreville, who comes running to the beach. The gendarmes are also awaken by the fireworks and they rush to the beach, not to watch, but to stop the three men doing it. When they see the gendarmes coming down on them, the three men sneak off in the dark.Next morning, Albert and Gabriel wake up in a disused German blockhouse. They climb up from the beach, where they meet a celebration with French, English and American officials. An English officer is thanking the mayor of Tigreville for the splendid fireworks the town gave them during the night !In the hotel, Marie is waiting for her daddy, whom she kisses when he enters the hotel. Albert tells Suzanne he is going to take the 3 p.m. train to go to his parent's grave.Suzanne drives her husband, Gabriel and Marie to the Deauville train station, where they board the train to Paris. Albert has to get off at Lisieux to take another train. But, before he leaves, he tells Marie a story, which gave the film its title. Here is the story :«In China, when the winter gets very cold, many young orphan monkeys get trapped in the cities. As the Chinese believe that even monkeys have a soul, they bring the monkeys back to their native forests. So, in wintertime, the trains get crowded with young monkeys going back to the jungle.»The train stops in Lisieux. Albert gets off the train and sits on a bench without looking at Gabriel and Marie, standing at the open window of their train compartment. The train starts leaving the station and Marie asks her father if Albert had already seen monkeys lost in the winter. Gabriel answers that he thinks he has at least seen one"

The three peripherals are: Otsuka and Toyama, rival union chiefs of what are the new pit and the old pit, the rivalry stemming from the differing views in the connection to the mining company itself; and the the deserter's adolescent son, who is traveling with his father and who views all these encounters largely from afar and thus unnoticed, and largely with the wide eyed innocence of a child.

Watch as events unfold and the effect this news has on the townspeople and Renu's mom.—rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) In a panel discussion during Jaipur Dev Festival 2020 , The noted comic actor Rakesh Bedi told us how fast Dev Saab would climb the stairs to his Kheera Nagar Office. The movie Asli Naqli begins with a similar scene when the protagonist Anand (Dev Saab) climbs several flights of stairs to his grandfather's office. The indulgent grandfather gives him twenty-five thousand rupees which Anand spends on frivolous entertainments.
The grandfather ( Nazir Hussain) is a very complex character. He spoils his grandson, but he is unhappy that he has turned out as a good for nothing young man. He says ' Gali Ka Kutta ( stray dog) bhi apne liye roti dhhond leta hai. Tum Ye Bhi Nahi Kar Sakte Ho', and other nasty lines which demolish the hero's self-esteem. The only use the grandfather can think of for his worthless grandson is to get him engaged to a super-rich Rekha( Indira Billi) who can bring in several sugar mills in dowry . If you are not able to place Indira Billi, please recall Firdaus of Mere Hazoor and Raj Kumar's dialogue- Lucknow Me Wo Kaun Si Firdaus Hai Jise Hum Nahi Jante.
The hero runs away and is taken in by Anwar Hussain who lives with his sister Sandhya Roy in a chawl. This is also the point of entry for the heroine Renu (Sadhana) who works as a private secretary in an office and helps the chawl dwellers with adult literacy lessons in the evening. Renu helps Anand get a job in her office,and the protagonists become love birds.
The strength of the movie is that the director Hrishikesh Mukherji has stuck to the basics. Number one, the romance between super handsome Dev Anand and super gorgeous Sadhana which rides on lovely SJ songs like EK But Banaunga Tera, Tujhe Jeevan Ki Dor Se, and Tera Mera Pyar Amar. Then, the director has very skilfully portrayed humour and human values in day to day situations in the lives of ordinary people.The scenes like when Mukri is taking his wife to a movie and is looking for a baby sitter for his son, show that a great director doesn't require extra ordinary situations and extravagant sets to keep the audience engaged. Unlike in Maya, there is no villain in this movie. The chawl dwellers are simple, honest , hard working , people who are full of compassion. They have their eccentricities which add spice to the story.
Dev Anand was at his best both in terms of looks and performance. Sadhana's glamour has been underplayed by the director which suits the part played by her. It was an unusual role for Nazir Hussain as he plays a rich ,arrogant, and selfish grandfather who even attempts villainy in the end. There was no scope for Indira Billi, but Sandhya Roy gave a scintillating performance. Anwar Hussain also deserves praise. Mukri was one of those comic actors who didn't get washed away by Mehmood's tidal wave, and continued to get roles in sixties and seventies. In this movie, he has a longish role which he performed very well. Keshto Mukherji also amuses with his Jee Haan as telephone operator. The review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the cameo of the great Moti Lal who gives life lessons to Dev Anand on Billiards Table."

The other girls begin running, trying to escape further bombs, and they run right into the arms of the Americans.Fearful that the Catholic nun Mary Joseph (Anna Sten) and the girls may reveal their position to the enemy, McGrath orders the women to accompany them. The sister is adamantly against that, but it's made clear to her that she has no choice if she and the girls want to live.The sister and the school girls are all very attractive, which makes it even more difficult for the men to focus on their conflicting objectives, which, depending on the particular men, are to either carry out the mission or try to escape. The women at one point strip down to their undergarments to take a refreshing swim. On another occasion, they are required to cross a deep river gorge on a rope bridge, requiring each of them to be escorted by the men, who embrace them from behind and walk them across. Some of the women don't hide their attraction to certain of the men, and vice versa.As for the prisoners, Dockman (Leo Gordon) is the main instigator for attempting to escape. He sets about approaching each of the others one at a time and recruiting them to the effort. His plan is to at some point cause McGrath to become a ""casualty of war."" He successfully convinces all but a few of them to go along. One of the men he has trouble convincing is Orville Nupert (Robert Easton), a tall southern boy who is extremely naive and is a member of a religious cult that worships snakes. He carries a snake, ""Pawnee,"" with him everywhere he goes, which frightens and disgusts Dockman. When Pawnee slips away from Johnson as the group is walking along a trail, Dockman smashes Pawnee with his rifle butt and then flips it off into the trees. That upsets Johnson a great deal and he can't understand why Dockman would do that.When one of the girls drifts away from the main group, McGrath and the sister backtrack to look for her. They find her just about the time she stumbles and falls into a fast-moving stream. Both McGrath and the sister end up in the stream as they attempt to rescue the girl. McGrath is able to get both women to the bank.While McGrath and the sister are gone looking for the lost girl, Dockman and his collaborators decide to attempt their escape. They disable and tie up Pak, but then, one by one, the other men decide that running away would be dishonorable, plus they've come to respect McGrath, so they choose to stay. Dockman is forced to give up his plan.Meanwhile, some of the girls discover some alcoholic beverages in the ruins of a nearby building and they decide to have a party. The men soon join in, and things threaten to get out of hand, as the participants begin to lose their inhibitions. No one is particularly concerned with how things are going until Dockman begins trying to force himself on one of the girls and she resists. Some of the other men rush in and pull Dockman off the girl.Rivas (Valentin De Vargas), who very much dislikes Dockman, hands the girl a belt and while two other men hold Dockman, she begins whipping Dockman. About that time, McGrath, the sister, and the lost girl all return. During the distraction of their arrival, Dockman escapes from the men holding him and he grabs the girl who was whipping him and puts his arm around her neck. He threatens to break her neck, just as Sister Mary Joseph picks up a rifle and points it at him, intending to shoot, but then she suddenly collapses. The other men then regain control over Dockman and tie him up.The sister was weakened by a leg wound suffered in the bombing of the road earlier. The wound has become infected and she is experiencing blood poisoning. She is also feeling guilty about picking up that rifle and fully intending to shoot Dockman with it. McGrath is asked by one of the girls to speak with the sister about that. McGrath decides to tell the sister that they both abide by the books of their trade. His is the marine corps manual, hers is the Bible. He explains that sometimes it takes a certain event or experience, causing them to question the authority of the book, to convince them just how important the book really is.The group continues on the march to the mission objective, arriving mid-day to see North Korean military vehicles exiting from the tunnel and passing through a security check-point. McGrath decides that they will wait until dark to attack. He learns from the Navy corpsman who was among the prisoners, that Sister Mary Joseph won't survive that long. The girls want McGrath to allow them to take the sister down to the North Korean camp, where a doctor would be stationed. He refuses, because it would compromise the mission.The sister attempts to calm any misgivings that McGrath may have about sacrificing her by telling him that ""death is my wedding day."" She does say she will try to hang on until that night, when McGrath promises to get her to a doctor after the tunnel is blown.The sister of the girl who died in the earlier bombing was among the surviving school girls and she has vowed vengeance against McGrath. This latest issue with McGrath's refusing to get Sister Mary Joseph to a doctor is the last straw for her, and she starts down the hill, calling out to the North Koreans. Dockman, who'd been released from his bonds and given a gun so he could assist in the attack that night, chases after the girl. It appears they are both shot by the North Koreans and they fall and roll down the hill.McGrath is forced to immediately improvise and adjust his plans. He allows the girls to fashion a makeshift stretcher and start carrying Sister Mary Joseph towards the North Korean Camp and a doctor. Meanwhile, he orders his men to take up arms and charge down the hill towards the tunnel and the security check point. Even Quill, the consummate coward, manages to force himself to join in. It's pretty much a suicide mission and several of the men are cut down almost immediately by machine gun fire, but as we observe the girls struggling to carry Sister Mary Joseph away, there's a massive explosion, indicating that the tunnel had been destroyed."

A semi-fictionalized version ofJohn Resko's incarceration is presented. John (Ben Gazzara) is on death row at Sing Sing for murder. In December 1930, he killed a toy store shopkeeper (Arthur Malet) over a teddy bear he wanted to get as a Christmas present for his two-year-old daughter, Cathy, but for which he could not pay. Twenty minutes before John's scheduled execution, he is given a reprieve, his sentence commuted to life, and he transferred to Dannemora. He initially has a difficult time adjusting to life at Dannemora, from the uncaring direction of the prison administration including they not dealing with the issue of bed bugs, to altercations with fellow prisoners who seem to want their two pounds of literal and figurative flesh from John, to news that he receives from the outside about goings-on within his family. However, he does eventually befriend many of his fellow prisoners, especially Nick (Timothy Carey), Iggy (Ray Walston) and Wino (Sammy Davis Jr.). John dreams of escaping from Dannemora, so that he can be at least an economically generating father for Cathy (Susan Silo), even if she may not want to resume a life with him. But one of the principals at the prison may have a way to get prisoners like John out of the system, by giving them creative outlets to show parole boards what is in their innermost thoughts. He wants to nurture what seems to be John's artistic abilities. Although John initially balks at the idea of art as an outlet, he does eventually get a passion for it, which leads to an outcome not expected by either the principal or John.—Huggo After his death sentence is commuted to life in prison, John Resko (Ben Gazzara) is transferred from Sing-Sing to Dannemora Prison where, with the help of a humane prison guard (Stuart Whitman), he becomes a rehabilitated man and a successful painter.

His second in command, David Robinson, questions his allegiance when Redway kills his father and takes his brother prisoner. In order to save his brother and avenge his father's death David must join forces with a band of pirates, led by Captain Bernard, hunt down and kill Redway. Along the way we are treated to sea battles, blood-thirsty cannibals, and wall-to-wall action.—Score_The_Film (vail_j@bellsouth.net) Set in the 1790s somewhere in the South Seas British Naval Officer, Commander Redway, arrives with his men on the island of Freeland to collect the annual tribute (in the form of pearls) to England.
Once ashore, Redway, his second in command, David Robinson, and their men meet with the island's
representative, Errol Robinson. David instantly recognizes Errol as his father and it turns out
David has a brother, Gary, he hasn't seen since he was a baby.Errol explains to Redway that the pearls set aside for the tribute were sold to buy steel nets to
protect them from the sharks in the area where the pearls can be found. Redway forces the
islanders, including David's family, to harvest more pearls without the net to gather enough pearls
for the tribute. Naturally, it's dangerous with the sharks in the area and when Gary protests he is
placed under arrest.Gary is taken aboard Redway's ship and is whipped. David, having enough of this abuse on his
brother, sets him free and holds the soldiers at bay whild Gary jumps ship and swims back to the
island. Now David is arrested and chained to the large rocks on the shore where, when high tides
approaches, he will drown. Luckily a pirate ship, led by Captain Bernard (with a former Bank of
England employee that now serves as the official pirate banker, Hornblut), arrives and fires upon
the British soldiers. Once the pirates land they take David prisoner, recognizing him as an officer
of the ship that had once attacked their ship.Now the pirates are off to their secret island of Quantral. On the island Bernard's daughter,
Jennifer, takes a liking to David and, out of pity, unshackles him so he can eat. He overcomes her
and forces her to take him to her father. David tells Bernard he has a plan to get Redway's ship in
exchange for half the booty. Bernard agrees.David swims to Redway's ship and disables the rudder. Jennifer, not trusting David, swims to the
ship to make sure David did his job and she is captured and taken prisoner by Redway. We discover,
as Redway talks to his native girl love slave, Nike, that he has been sailing on behalf of England
for seven years and has spent all of the money he's collected for England and his only objective is
to collect/steal as much money as possible and retire next year to London.Bernard goes after Redway to save his daughter and to seek revenge. He eventually catches up to
Redway and attacks his ship. Meanwhile, Redway and a few of his men escape with some of the
treasure in a dingy and returns to Freeland.David makes his way back to Freeland to discover his father has been killed and that Redway has
taken Gary prisoner and has managed to make their way to Grantsville, an English military island
base. David follows and allows himself to be captured in exchange for his brother's freedom.After an unsuccessful attempt at torturing David to get the information about the secret pirate
island, Quantral, Redway allows Nike to use her feminine ways to get what he wants. She's having a
difficult time, too, until she drugs David's drink that puts him under enough that he'll answer
anything she asks him. Naturally, he tells her but is unaware. When he awakens she assures him
that he told her nothing. Now she goes to Redway and gives him the location of Quantral. Redway
locks David up to die, goes to Quantral and attacks the island eventually forcing the pirates to
surrender.Redway only wants the pirate treasure and soon discovers that the treasure has been taken to a
nearby island inhabited by the cannibal tribe, Carbi. Redway shoots Bernard and makes his way to
the island. They find the trail of the treasure when they come accross the bodies of the pirates
who came before them. When one of Redway's men is killed by an arrow in the neck, Redway retreats
back to the ship. Nike tells him that she's half Carbi (from her mother) and that she can't go back
because she's been banished by the tribe for shacking up with a white man (by the way, she's very
European in very dark brown makeup) but she knows how Redway can get the treasure. All he needs to
do is arrange to sell some of the pirate prisoners to the Carbi in exchange for the pearls.Redway takes ten prisoners to the island. David, in an adjoining cell, fears for Jennifer's life and strangles a guard through the bars and frees himself. He finds Nike and forces her to tell him
where Jennifer and the rest of the prisoners went. He makes his way to the island. Redway gets his
pearls and the newly sold slaves are tied to a giant bush-like man-eating tree as a human sacrifice.
David sets them free.Back on Quantral the pirates want to hang David for betraying them but David talks them out of it
and into letting him lead the pirates to go after Redway who's on his way back to Grantsville with
the treasure. David, in chains with some other pirate prisoners, is led by a small group of British
soldiers which we soon discover are pirates in disguise. Once inside the British base they attack.Redway just wants to escape to London with the treasure so he kills Nike when she trys to force him
to take her with him. David finds her and in her dying moments tells him where the secret passage
way is where Redway escaped through. David makes chase and confronts Redway and his men. David
kills the soldiers leaving only Redway. The fight it out with giant harpoons. When Redway sees the
opportunity of escape he runs through a giant gateway only to be crushed by the iron gate as David
kicks the mechanism that drops it.A new British Commander has taken over in the dead Redway's place and has declared freedom for the
pirates and they are free to thrive in peace on Quantral. Life is beautiful."

Hapless Second Lieutenant Merle Wye of the US army's intelligence service is dismayed that he has not seen any action - he imagining himself as a suave undercover agent, worming secrets out of exotic female spies - instead being confined to a desk job in Honolulu. For non-military reasons, Merle is assigned a new posting - his first field job - that on the South Pacific island of Rodahan. He eventually learns that both his job on Rodahan and the posting in general are rather innocuous, as the Americans liberated Rodahan from the Japanese eight months ago, there has been no action there ever since, and as such it is a rather quiet, idyllic locale. All the Japanese soldiers on the island surrendered at the time, that is all except one, a man named Kobayashi, who is unarmed and seen as being harmless because of it. Merle's job is to locate and bring in Kobayashi, solely because he has been pilfering luxury goods from the US army commissary and officers' quarters the last little while.

Merle's job is not made any easier by the presence of Navy Commander Jeremiah Hammerslag, also newly posted to the island and a man who is overly officious also to be rather useless, and the help of Merle's underling, Sergeant Roy Tada, who is more interested in the twelve women he is currently courting back home than he is with anything to do with the army, especially if those army tasks get himself killed. Through it all, Merle tries to bolster the nature of this job and its dangers to woo the woman of his dreams, army nurse Lieutenant Molly Blue, who he knew and basically dismissed while in college back in Kansas, but who has blossomed since, and as such can have her pick of any man she wants, most who outrank Merle.—Huggo"

A young policeman, Dave Hollis, comes across a woman, Lisa Shillack, trying to break into a mews flat. It turns out she lives there, and has left her latch key in the house. She persuades him to climb the drainpipe and get the key, and let her in.She talks him into drinking coffee with her, and it emerges that she is German and he spent some time in Germany in the military police. He spends some time in her flat, though nothing amorous takes place.Meanwhile a robbery has taken place at a location on Dave's beat. He is all unaware of the robbery, although his schedule should have had him there at the time. But he waits at the mews, while the girl puts her car in the garage, and a neighbour shouts down from the window complaining about the noise from the car. She threatens to call the police, and our policeman shows himself; the neighbour purses her lips and withdraws. Eventually the policeman leaves.At the police station police Inspector Gorman tells Hollis off, and demands an explanation as to how he was not at the location at the right time. Hollis tells a made-up story about investigating a possible break in at a timber yard. He is typing up his report and confides his story to another policeman, Joe Ross.Hollis realises he has left his torch with Lisa Shillack, and his colleague tells him he should go and fetch it before she brings it in and gives the game away. He is in her flat chatting when her husband comes in unexpectedly. Mr Shillack and his wife argue and it is obvious they are not happy with one another, She is seeing him off in the street when the women who complained about the noise passes, and again she purses her lips.
Lisa and Dave now go to a casino, where he loses on the roulette wheel, but it is obvious a romantic attachment is developing; she assures him he is not breaking up a happy home. As they are leaving the manager intercepts Dave and reminds him that he has a large debt to the casino; the manager insists he pays off his account at the earliest opportunity.Back at the police station, Dave's colleague is approved to transfer to CID work, but Dave is turned down. The inspector tells him that he has been performing poorly lately, and tells him to buck up. Joe Ross commiserates after a tennis game, and advises Dave that he needs to find a rich widow, or else a woman with a rich husband who is often absent.Now he is at Lisa's house: Lisa obviously fits that profile. Lisa's husband is delayed abroad, but she tells Dave obliquely that she is considering murdering her husband. Dave leaves.That evening a car draws up alongside Dave and he is forcibly dragged into the car, and taken to the casino, where the manager threatens him over the debt, and has him beaten up. He goes to Lisa's house and tells her about the debt. Lisa raises the possibility of murdering her husband once more; this would generate the money Dave needs (although he has only got two weeks to pay up). Lisa produces a gun and urges Dave to kill her husband.Lisa's husband is planning a week-long business trip to Germany; is she sure she doesn't want to go with him? No she doesn't; but now he discovers that the gun is missing. He reports the loss but it is Dave who takes the call; he destroys the written notes he took from Lisa's husband's call.Lisa gives Dave an expensive bracelet she wears, so that he can use it to reassure the Casino manager that he will get paid. Dave and Lisa spend the night at the hotel that is connected to the casino, using the bracelet as a deposit. Their presence at the hotel will be Dave's alibi against becoming a suspect when her husband is murdered. Dave manages to sneak out unobserved, so that no-one knows he has left. Dave gets his uniform on and is let in by Lisa's husband, as he assumes he is there to take a statement about the missing gun. Dave produces the gun and shoots Lisa's husband.The complaining neighbour hears the gunshot and calls out to Dave as he leaves, complaining about people ""letting off fireworks"".
Dave returns to the hotel, having changed back into civilian clothes and manages to get into the room to join Lisa. Lisa now goes home and phones the police to report having found her husband dead. The police arrive; ""is there anyone who would wish to kill your husband?""
We don't hear the answer, but there is now an exterior shot; Dave is apparently on guard, and the police inspector, looking grim, tells him to come up into the flat.Lisa has told the police that Dave has threatened that he would kill her husband. In front of Dave, Lisa tells a story of Dave's vengeful intention to kill him. They go to the hotel and the manager says that Dave was not at the hotel; a maid served dinner to Lisa, and she was alone; and Dave's entry in the hotel register is missing. The casino manager says that they had barred Dave. We realise that the manager and Lisa are lovers, and that they have used Dave to get rid of Lisa's husband for them.Dave loudly protests his innocence. Now the woman who shouted down to Dave is brought in; she didn't see Dave very clearly in the dark, but she is certain she would recognise his voice. The Inspector asks Dave a question, intending that the woman would hear him speak, but he refuses to speak.Then a CID man enters with the murder gun; it was found in Dave's lodgings. Things look overwhelmingly bad for Dave, but Dave the grabs the gun and shoots the CID man and escapes.For five days he is on the run and evades capture; we see that he is hiding out in an attic space above the changing rooms at the police tennis club. He hears his former colleagues mentioning that Lisa will be back home tonight. At the police station they appreciate that basic food supplies are going missing from the tennis club. Ross realises that is where Dave is hiding out. They go there but Dave has left. Ross knows where he has gone.Outside Lisa's flat, she arrives and as promised a policeman is guarding the place. In fact we see that it is Dave; she puts her car in the garage and the policeman who was posted as a guard is lying on the ground, dead. Dave comes in and produces the gun and shoots Lisa. Ross and the other policemen arrive and bang on the door of the garage.Next we hear the judge at Dave's trial giving the verdict of a death sentence."

Harold becomes a hero when he thwarts the robbers once more when they attempt to steal a mail-bag containing used bank notes which are being returned for destruction. As his reward, Harold gets promoted back to his home village as Postmaster.—Steve Smith <sp.smith@virgin.net> Harold Petts takes his job as a postman in the village of Upper Tringly seriously, and he does it well and efficiently with his customers in mind, going above and beyond in doing duties which would not be considered regulation. Things are different when he is promoted to work in the central post office in London, his village ways which only don't serve him well professionally, but make him a fish out of water in London life in general.

The true thieves, Rupert and his gang, were unsuccessful in their theft, which was just a routine theft for them.

As such, Rupert wants to muscle in on Maldon's theft of the notes. Things become even more complicated when the police place somewhat hapless PC Woods in the role to monitor the movements of Harold to ensure he isn't truly a thief, Woods who not only believes Harold and Jean are in cahoots with each other in Jean's innocent assistance of Harold in navigating London life, but believe they are part of Maldon's gang.—Huggo"

Little Red Riding-Hood,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056430/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Once upon a time there was a little girl named Rotkaeppchen. She lived with her father and mother at the edge of a village, and often visited her grandmother on the other side of the woods. Her rabbit friend, Haeschen, lives with Grandmother and was sent one day to fetch medicine and milk from Rotaeppchen and her mother. Although her mother was reluctant to allow her to visit Grandmother alone, Rotkaeppchen convinces her that she will be safe with Haeschen. Together they set out through the woods. Unfortunately, there were many distractions in the woods: mushrooms to pick and Rotkaeppchen's other playmate, the bear. There are also the dangerous fox and wolf, who plotted to capture Rotkaeppchen and eat her. Haeschen did his best to keep them safe, but he could not prevent the wolf from eating Grandmother . . . and also Rotkaeppchen! Who will save them? The DEFA version of Rotkaeppchen differs from the Grimms' version in some minor areas: the mother plays a greater role in the film; DEFA has the father save the day, rather than the huntsman; the wolf does not die at the end, though he is carried away by the family; the second encounter with the wolf at the end of the original tale is left out; and a few animal characters are added (Haeschen, Baer, and das Eichhoernchen). All the animals (other than the Eichhoernchen) are played by people in animal costumes, and Jochen Bley as Haeschen was the big hit with critics and viewers alike. Both warmly and critically received by the press upon its release, Rotkaeppchen followed closely on the heels of the very successful Schneewittchen; hence, in some cases, the disappointment. Many reviews cited Goetz Friedrich's background in theater (both in positive and negative interpretations) to explain the spare, two-dimensional feel of the set. Yet nearly all commented positively on the color and interesting characters, and the Progress press materials summed up the morals for the viewers to learn: ""Do what you are told, but act independently when it is necessary; never leave the path, especially the path that your friends have marked with love and experience; be brave, fight against evil, help your friends."" Since its release, Rotkaeppchen has become one of the most popular DEFA fairy tale films.—DEFA Film Library"

Tired of the sexual escapades on earth by his daughter Venus, Jupiter, the god of Lightning, decides he shall marry her soon to one of the candidates: Maciste, a mortal working in Vulcano's cave, and Mars, the god of War. But Mars abducts Venus, allied with Pluto and Eris, and works out a plan involving a bamboo tower high enough for the soldiers of the Thracian King to attack Jupiter in the high Olympus. The gods' contend will be resolved in human fashion on Earth, where even gods are mortal.—Artemis-9 Once again, blue-eyed blonde Venus has fled from the Olympus to Earth - to enjoy the company of a man. Jupiter sends a dart against Adonis, who falls dead at Venus' feet. Mars insinuates that Jupiter is afraid of Venus, ""the most beautiful woman on Earth"". Juno, Jupiter's wife and Mercury insist with Jupiter that Venus herself should be punished. But Jupiter hesitates about to whom Venus should be married.Venus visits the blacksmith Vulcan's workshop, and praises his work, and the big swords he produces, while her eyes dart to his bare-chest, well-built body. ""Are you always alone?""
""None of your business,"" he replies, harshly.
He is attracted to her alright, but he wants to wait for Jupiter's decision about whom she shall marry.Mars is not one to wait - and invites Venus to marry him and elope out of Olympus in his four-horse chariot that very night, which she accepts. Mars visits Vulcan's shop too, and wants to have a beautiful shield he sees there, but it is denied to him; Maciste says it is customer-made for Hercules. Mars is upset that a simple man can have what he wants to possess. After some words, the two gods fight - like men - until Jupiter himself enters the cave, and orders them to stop.Pluto, God of Darkness, had come with Jupiter and, before leaving, he shows his devious character; he robs a little dagger from Vulcan's forge and hides it in his cape.Warned about Venus hasty departure, Vulcan tries to stop Mars from abducting Venus, but is stopped by a Titan armed with a trident, who wounds him. In consequence, Vulcan falls from the Olympus to Earth - but he is so lucky that he lands by a seashore where Etna and six other long black-haired Nymphs wearing mini-dresses, are frolicking on the water. They help him to stand and walk - but then, a few man-lizards come upon them armed with tridents, and capture them all.Meanwhile, Mars and Venus arrived on a war-chariot to the court of Milos, the bald King of the Thracian. Mars plans to build a bamboo tower high enough to reach the Olympus, up which a good number of Thracian warriors will step. When the soldiers arrive at the gates of Olympus, Jupiter will lose his powers, and Mars will be King! And Venus will be his queen. King Minos will have a royal reward.King Minos calls it ""audacious"" and says, ""It's madness! Folly!"" It will take many, many more men than he has, if they want to get this done. Mars tells him to capture some more slaves from Sicily. The king is reluctant to join Mars in his plan to overthrow Jupiter, but then Venus starts her seduction number.Geo, a man who's courage is proportionate to his little size, is charged by the prisoner Nymphs to inform their father Neptune of the situation - which he does, reluctantly.Meanwhile, Vulcan has wrestled with and killed the leader of the lizard-men, and shortly after, he leaves those caves in Etna's company - promising the other Sicilian prisoners, now free, that he shall return.Under the protection of Neptune, Vulcan is enjoying a lascivious dance by Etna when suddenly, Mercury interrupts it. Mercury announces that Mars has rebelled against Jupiter, which leads Vulcan to ask permission to return to Earth in order to do battle and submit Mars. Neptune blesses Vulcan's self-imposed mission.Mercury's hand was already being attracted by Etna's thigh, Neptune pulls his ear like a misbehaving kid.
Vulcan wishes to return alone to do battle with Mars, considering the danger of the mission, but Etna wants to go with him; he rudely shoves her back. Instead, he takes Geo as his companion - against his will... but Etna follows him anyway, unseen, from a distance.
Mars calls for Eris's help, and the brunette goddess of hate is only too ready to be of help.The King and his men have gathered a good number of Sicilian people, and made them slaves again; then they proceed to whiplash them at will, namely their leader, Yulo.Etna is captured by cavemen, but her screams reach Geo's ears, and Vulcan beats the half a dozen cavemen single-handled, or rather with the unnecessary help of Geo, who clubs a pair of cavemen who were already knocked down.An oracle reveals to Mars and King Milos that Vulcan is approaching, and that he comes with a beautiful woman. Indeed, a beautiful Sicilian brunette is about to do something desperate to stop the building of the tower: either escape, or sabotage the tower. Anyway, her moment of rebellion is short lived; she's caught by the soldiers, and led to the King, who orders her to be whipped.Geo seems to be playing with sand, but he's actually foreseeing the right way to the King's camp... (The little man has powers, too.)Vulcan, forced to accept Etna's company, is unable to sleep at night without her company. Next morning, he lives her again, ordering her to wait for his return. She does, only to be captured again; this time, by King Milos' soldiers. He's about to kill her, as she doesn't want to tell where Vulcan is, but Mars interferes, deciding that to keep her alive will bring Vulcan after her, so that he can meet him in deadly combat.In the royal tent, Venus has a sleepless night; the words of the oracle come back to her, and her heart is filled with jealousy for the woman prisoner outside, bound to a post in the cold darkness of the night... She grabs a piece of cloth to protect her almost nude body, and goes out to confront Etna - the woman who has won Vulcan's heart. She does an interrogation of her own about Vulcan's whereabouts, but Etna takes a good look at her, and replies, ""Go away. Vulcan hates you. I hate you, too!"" She is slapped and back slapped for it.Next morning, Vulcan and Geo are infiltrating the King's camp. Yulo, the Sicilian rebel leader, was not dead yet, against what the soldiers had thought, and he is revived by Vulcan. In silence, they cut the metal chains off the slaves' hands. Vulcan leads the attack, and former slaves armed with makeshift weapons battle the well armed soldiers. The Thracian King is killed with a spear to the chest by Yulo and the tide turns against the Thracians.Geo cuts the rope around Etna's wrists, and she gladly frees herself of the other binds. Then, Etna, wearing a sleeveless pink top over a light blue skirt, runs after Venus, whom she has seen running into her tent, wearing a sleeveless black dress and armed with a long whip. Once inside, Etna takes two long whip slashes that send her to the ground. Venus keeps using the long whip on Etna's defenseless body, about six times, until the girl manages to grab the whip, and pull suddenly. Surprised, Venus falls, and let's go of the whip's handle. Now it's her turn to take the medicine she had given to Etna.Outside, the battle rages on, and Vulcan does a couple of deeds of strength and then he comes head to head with Mars. The two bare-chest heroes wrestle, punch and kick each other to the groin. The men's fight comes a halt when Vulcan's bear-hug breaks Mars' strength. Mars falls onto his back, Vulcan kneels astride his waist, and lifts up a sword to plunge it hilt deep into Mars' chest (who's vulnerable when on Earth...).Jupiter's commanding voice is heard over the valley, stopping all combat. While all the standing men - and Etna and Venus (denoting a cut in their fight scene) - look up at the clouded sky from where Jupiter's voice comes, Mars takes Venus' hand, and runs away with her.Jupiter condemns Mars and Venus to some penalty, and determines that Vulcan shall stay on Earth until the father of the gods so wishes, a sentence that pleases both Vulcan and Etna, now hugging and smiling, like Yulo and the Rebel Girl, as the adventure comes to THE END."

The Man from the First Century,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056265/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A workman is accidentally sent into outer space, where he meets an alien that can make himself invisible. They return to Earth in the year 2447. Complications ensue. In the near future in Czechoslovakia (the movie was made in 1961, after all), a space flight is in the final stages of preparation. As the astronauts are being interviewed, Joseph the upholsterer (Milos Kopecký) is gluing the last bits of padding in place. Joseph is lazy and incompetent, and always complaining -- the classic goof-off who tries to shift blame to anywhere but him. While his supervisor berates him for being behind schedule via the communicator screen in the ship, Joseph manages to kick the takeoff switch and the rocket takes off into space with him as the only passenger.Next we see Joseph (with a full beard now, apparently to demonstrate that much time has passed) returning home in the ship with an alien companion from the ""Blue Star"" named Adam (Vít Olmer). The viewer never sees Adam's home world, but we learn that he has accompanied Joseph home to learn more about the ""pattern"" of humans. Adam looks exactly like a human except for a slightly larger, hairless cranium. His clothes are very ""futuristic"", even more so than those the humans are wearing when they reach Earth. After landing, Adam uses a small handheld device of his to become invisible, the better to observe the humans.Joseph discovers to his surprise that 500 years have passed. During an interview with the local government administrators and scientists, Joseph is amused then he administrator asks him, ""When did socialism come to Luxembourg?"", and he responds, ""Socialism? Radio Luxembourg? Oh boy!"" In turn, they laugh at him when he asks ""Is this the East... or the West?"", with the obvious implication that the East prevailed over the years and everything is now a happy worker's Socialist paradise: ""He IS from the First Century."" Everyone he sees is happy and content, with modern conveniences everywhere and no apparent conflicts anywhere. War appears to be a thing of the past.Joseph is given a guide (Josef Hlinomaz), a new apartment and access to a machine that can deliver anything a person wants to select from a catalog. Confronted with the ability to fulfill his every desire, he goes wild with gluttony and begins tearing pages from the catalog and feeding them into the machine. Dozens of boxes of ""stuff"" appear -- including a giraffe, which seems to be the ultimate symbol of consumption for its own sake. This begins to make the locals wonder if there's not something wrong with ""The Man from The First Century"", and they decide he's been infected with ""greedyitis"".Ultimately Joseph is called upon to explain himself, and is interviewed by people from around the world via television. Joseph's self-importance and lack of knowing anything important, even about his own time, disgusts the assembled viewers, and they begin to drop out of the meeting. Desperate for attention, Joseph claims to have discovered a new fuel source he ""invented"" on the Blue Star (which is actually Adam's people's technology), which brings renewed interest in him. Of course, he knows nothing about the subject, and convinces Adam to help him as part of his continued study of humans. Adam agrees, but his studies are beginning to show that Joseph is quite different from the other humans on Earth, and he begins to distrust Joseph.Much of the movie is Joseph making a complete buffoon of himself everywhere he goes -- a museum, a bar, etc. He can't fit in because everyone else is happy and content with their lives (one character says he enjoys cutting up onions because it's his only chance for a good cry), while Joseph is still his old incompetent, greedy and blame-shifting self.A love interest is introduced by the characters Peter (Radovan Lukavský) and Eve (Anita Kajlichova), young scientists who are obviously in love and want to marry, but Peter is depressed because he doesn't have a dowry (?), and can't make the offer. The fuel formula figures prominently in this subplot, and in the denouement is presented by Adam to Peter and Eve as a gift, ""Because you're in love.""Ultimately, Joseph's increasing inability to fit in begins to disgust his hosts and they begin to reject him, and in a fit of near-madness Joseph tells them about Adam and claims that he is studying Earth in order to attack it with advanced weapons. Joseph is finally sent off to the ""sanitarium"" to have his greedyitis cured, and while there sees via the video screen when Adam greets the others and declares his peaceful intentions: ""Why would thinking beings want to make war with one another?""Realizing he's ruined, Joseph sneaks out of the hospital and makes his way back to the rocketship, where he takes off, intending to go back to the Blue Star. Adam is watching with the others on the video screen, and alters the rocket's course to send him back to where he came. The final shot is the administrator breaking the Fourth Wall and speaking directly to us: ""Look out, people. He's coming back to YOU."""

If his death is reported, the contract is useless. Smuggling Paolini's corpse back into his office, Parodi, Manzini and Bellini hope to delay the discovery of his death long enough for the contract to become valid. However, their attempts are compromised by the intervention two buffoonish nightwatchmen at the dead man's office, named Franco and Ciccio. While Parodi, Manzini, and Bellini try to get the dead Paoloni into his chair, the ""masseuses"" distract Franco and Ciccio. When Franco, not to be distracted, goes to check Paolini's office, the conspirators hide the corpse behind a curtain and switch off the lights.

Mefail catches up to him and starts beating him, but he stops when soldiers led by Ramiz(who have obviously followed the courier)open fire. Kadrija joins the soldiers and helps them take over the Balist camp.While checking the prisoners, Ramiz notices that some members of the gang, including Murtezi and Mefail, are not among them. Kadrija realizes that they are planning to rob Hasan-beg of his gold and tells Ramiz about it.Meanwhile, Balists surprise Hasan-beg at his house, kill his other servant and take him and Azira as prisoners in their own house. In order to get Azira to tell him about the other bag of gold, Murtezi reveals that Hasan-beg is responsible for the murder of her first husband-his own older brother.Jealous because his brother was meant to marry Azira and inherit the wealth of their late father, Hasan-beg paid Murtezi and his men to ambush and kill his brother in the hills.

Hearing the gunshot, Mefail enters the room and kills Hasan-beg before seeing 2 peasants carrying out a wounded Azira. Realizing they are surrounded, Murtezi orders Mefail to lead the men into the hills through a back exit. Meanwhile, he secures all the gold he found, planning to escape with it through the main entrance as his men are battling with the soldiers. As he is trying to escape, he is seen by Ramiz, who is waiting down the staircase, and a shootout starts between them.As all this is happening, the rest of the gang tries to escape through the back exit.

Wild Ones on Wheels,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056694/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A gang murders an ex-con and forces his wife to help them find $250,000 he had buried in the desert. This film essentially begins with a man by the name of ""Duke Walker"" (Sydney Mason) about to be released from prison after serving twelve years for a robbery. Since the money (about $250,000) was never found a number of people think that Duke hid it somewhere. To that effect, one particular group led by a man named ""King Tut"" (Edmund Tontini), decide to stakeout a diner where Duke's wife ""Hazel"" (Francine York) works on the assumption that it will be the first place Duke visits once he's release from prison. Hazel, in the meantime, has been having an affair with another young man named ""Bill James"" (Robert Blair) who has also developed an interest in the money as well. Be that as it may, when Duke does show up, both he and Hazel are kidnapped by King Tut who soon demonstrates that he is willing to do whatever it takes to get his hand on the stolen loot. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was an okay ""hot rod film"" in which the director (Rudolph Cusumano) managed to take good advantage of the desert setting to minimize the overall costs of production. Likewise, although the acting wasn't great, it was equally sufficient for the task at hand as well with the best performances probably being turned in by Francine York and Robert Blair. Admittedly, this film is quite dated but for a grade-B film of this nature it wasn't too bad and I have rated it accordingly. Average.—Uriah43"

Anno 79: La distruzione di Ercolano,1962,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055754/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Intrigue at the Roman Emperor's court prior to its destruction by Vesuvius. In 79 AD the Roman city of Herculaneum was destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius. The film spends a lot of time and money, with numerous extras, on the political intrigues at the court of the emperor Titus Flavius, but the actual eruption is underplayed.—Hazel Freeman <hazel@sabrina.demon.co.uk> General Marcus Tiberius, the nephew of Emperor Titus Flavius, returns to Rome in triumph and finds it in turmoil. More and more people are being murdered on the streets and the community of Christians are being blamed. However Tiberius accuses Tercius, the emperor's unscrupulous advisor, of using the Christians as a scapegoat for everything that is going on. Titus Flavius tells Tiberius that the Christians are gathering together for a celebration at Heraculum and orders him to go there and await further orders. Tercius is says that the Christians are ""the enemies of Rome and should all be destroyed."" Tiberius goes to Heraculum and confronts the Christian leader. Lepidus, Tiberius, faithful centurion, recognises him as a man he has followed for 20 years and tells Tiberius that he is a good man. Convinced that the Christians bear no threat to Rome, he lets them all go back to their homes. When he returns to Rome and explains to Titus Flavius what he has done, the emperor strips him of all his titles and sent into exile to the Roman province of Illyia. However Tiberius is determined to investigate the matter himself. Not as a soldier, but as the nephew of Titus Flavius, Emperor of Rome. Amidst all of the love, passion and intrigue going on at the court of Titus Flavius in AD 79, a disaster is looming. In the shadow of the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, the city is about to be destroyed.—bcarruthers-76500 Don't you think you should change the name of this movie to A D 79 The Destruction of Herculaneum aka Anno 79 La Distruzione di Ercolano (1962) so that viewers know it is also available with an English dialogue. If you search for the movie using its English name it comes up ""nothing found,"" which defeats the object.—bcarruthers-76500"

The Prussian Major von Tellheim has become engaged to the Saxon noblewoman Minna von Barnhelm. After the war, the King - in an unwarranted move - deprives the major of his honor.

She and her lady's maid Franziska are questioned and spied on by the nosy innkeeper.
