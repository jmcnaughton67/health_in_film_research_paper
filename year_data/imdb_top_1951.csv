Blanche DuBois, a high school English teacher with an aristocratic background from Auriol, Mississippi, decides to move to live with her sister and brother-in-law, Stella and Stanley Kowalski, in New Orleans after creditors take over the family property, Belle Reve.

Knowing nothing about Stanley or the Kowalskis' lives, Blanche is shocked to find that they live in a cramped and run down ground floor apartment - which she proceeds to beautify by putting shades over the open light bulbs to soften the lighting - and that Stanley is not the gentleman that she is used to in men. As such, Blanche and Stanley have an antagonistic relationship from the start. Blanche finds that Stanley's hyper-masculinity, which often displays itself in physical outbursts, is common, coarse and vulgar, being common which in turn is what attracted Stella to him. Beyond finding Blanche's delicate hoidy-toidy act as putting on airs, Stanley, a plant worker, believes she may really have sold Belle Reve and is withholding Stella's fair share of the proceeds from them. What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley's first child. Soon after her arrival at the Kowalskis, Blanche starts to date Mitch, one of Stanley's friends and coworkers who is a little softer around the edges than most of Stanley's friends. Mitch does not hide the fact that he is looking in general to get married because of a personal issue, he wanting Blanche ultimately to be his wife. Mitch is somewhat unaware that Blanche has somewhat controlled their courtship to put herself in the best possible light, both figuratively and literally. But in Stanley's quest to find out the truth about Belle Reve and Blanche's life in Auriol, the interrelationships between Stanley, Blanche, Stella and Mitch may be irrevocably affected, with any revelation about that life which may further destroy what's left of Blanche's already damaged mental state.—Huggo Troubled former schoolteacher Blanche DuBois as she leaves small-town Mississippi and moves in with her sister, Stella Kowalski and her husband, Stanley, in New Orleans. Blanche's flirtatious Southern-belle presence causes problems for Stella and Stanley, who already have a volatile relationship, leading to even greater conflict in the Kowalski household.—Jwelch5742 Blanche is in real need of a protector at this stage in her life when circumstances lead her into paying a visit to her younger sister Stella in New Orleans. She doesn't understand how Stella, who is expecting her first child, could have picked a husband so lacking in refinement. Stanley Kowalski's buddies come over to the house to play cards and one of them, Mitch, finds Blanche attractive until Stanley tells him about what kind of a woman Blanche really is. What will happen when Stella goes to the hospital to have her baby and just Blanche and her brother-in-law are in the house?—Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> Set in the French Quarter of New Orleans during the restless years following World War Two, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is the story of Blanche DuBois, a fragile and neurotic woman on a desperate prowl for someplace in the world to call her own. After being exiled from her hometown of Laurel, Mississippi, for seducing a seventeen-year-old boy at the school where she taught English, Blanche explains her unexpected appearance on Stanley and Stella's (Blanche's sister) doorstep as nervous exhaustion. This, she claims, is the result of a series of financial calamities which have recently claimed the family plantation, Belle Reve. Suspicious, Stanley points out that ""under Louisiana's Napoleonic code what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband."" Stanley, a sinewy and brutish man, is as territorial as a panther. He tells Blanche he doesn't like to be swindled and demands to see the bill of sale. This encounter defines Stanley and Blanche's relationship. They are opposing camps and Stella is caught in no-man's-land. But Stanley and Stella are deeply in love. Blanche's efforts to impose herself between them only enrages the animal inside Stanley. When Mitch -- a card-playing buddy of Stanley's -- arrives on the scene, Blanche begins to see a way out of her predicament. Mitch, himself alone in the world, reveres Blanche as a beautiful and refined woman. Yet, as rumors of Blanche's past in Auriol begin to catch up to her, her circumstances become unbearable.—Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu> Elia Kazan,who directed the Broadway play on which the black and white film is based, invited Marlon Brando, the male lead, and Kim Hunter and Karl Malden, his supporting cast, to repeat their Broadway triumphs in the film remake.Brando plays Stanley, a poor boy who grew up tainted by ethnic slurs, made financially stable by the fortunes of the second world war. He does well as a blue collar travelling salesman, moves to New Orleans and marries Stella (Hunter), daughter of an Aristocratic MIssissippi family anxious to escape the war;s invitable destruction of her family's land, wealth, property and social status. Stanley has never met his sister-in-law Blanche, the female lead of the play ,Vivien Leigh in the movie remake. Blanche arranges a visit to see her sister in New Orleans and shows up on Stanley's doorstop obviously annoyed that there is neither a guest bedroom for herself nor a master bedroom for her sister and brother-in-law, in their cramped, dingy apartment in a bustling quarter of the city. The tensions of wartime emergency cohabitation of family members somehow forced to move in with each other in tight, cramped quarters because of the fortunes of war are noted when it is obvious that Blanche and Stanley immediately get on each others' nerves, especially when Blanche, who passes herself off as the only Aristocrat in her new neighborhood, is the only one in her new neighborhood who actually resorts to tough bar language and ethnic slurs in passing conversation. This becomes no ordinary domestic quarrel when their tensions escalate beyond a war of words to hurtful, spiteful deeds and then to climatic physical violence. Hollywood icons Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh are given close, tight photography in their lengthy scenes of escalating conflict, played with such deep insight and such technical brilliance that the audience is given pause, from moment to moment. to decide whether one really has a point and the other should really be apprehended by the authorities. Stanley first wants to know why Blanche seems to be planning to stay for life and what happened to his wife's claim on the family fortune, land, property and social status. Blanche wants Stanley to give up his weekly card game and his weekly bowling tournament with his friends including Mitch (Malden), to stay at home always sweating in his dirtied work clothes because he will have no place to wash and change with a lady in his house, sitting silent like a statue, until he decides it is time to just turn his paycheck over to Stella and move out so Blanche can rule the roost.
When Blanche attracts the attention of lonely Mitch who sees the remnants of her Aristocratic upbringing, Stanley investigates, through a friend travelling in Mississippi, why his emotionally disturbed, alcoholic, child molesting sister-in-law was fired from her job and kicked out of her boarding house. A telling interlude has Stanley striking Stella for interfering with his treatment of Blanche. She escapes to the upstairs apartment of her landlady (Peg Hillias), but is so dependent upon Stanley that she returns to him when he goes into the yard and calls for her to come back. Things do not go well for Blanche when Stella goes to the hospital to give birth to her child just after a teenage boy accuses her of making improper advances when he came to her door to collect money for Stanley's periodical subscription and Mitch dumps her. There is surrealistic moment, to be individually sorted out by each viewer, when Blanche insists she is going to cut up Stanley's face with the jagged edges of a broken liquor bottle and then insists he is going to rape her. The play and the movie cuts from the blackout to a scene some time later when Stella is putting her baby to sleep in the front yard, Stanley is having his card game over, and authorities arrive from the local mental institution to put Blanche away for life.The landlady calls Stella to the bathroom, where Blanche is soaking up her cares in another hot water tub and wants the ladies to dress her in her faded, fake finery so a nonexistent gentleman friend can escort her on a nonexistent world cruise. Stella, Mitch and the landlady seem in agreement that Blanche is an innocent flower ravaged by wartime whom Stanley destroyed with his crude bullying."
Strangers on a Train,1951,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044079/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A psychopathic man tries to forcibly persuade a tennis star to agree to his theory that two strangers can get away with murder by submitting to his plan to kill the other's most-hated person. Bruno Antony thinks he has the perfect plot to rid himself of his hated father, and when he meets tennis player Guy Haines on a train he thinks he's found the partner he needs to pull it off. His plan is relatively simple: Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants gone. For example, Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam, freeing him to marry Anne Morton, the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand, but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the ""bargain"" and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks, Bruno makes it clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused to divorce him. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder, forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings.—garykmcd Guy Haines is a well-known amateur tennis player who wants to go into politics in his post-tennis life. He is equally well-known in the society papers as a man who wants to divorce his wife in order to marry Anne Morton, the refined daughter of a state senator. Bruno Antony is a charming, gregarious man who lives off his father's wealth. He's also a sociopath who loves his mentally-childlike mother, but detests his father, who wants to have him restrained. Guy and Bruno meet one day on a train. Their social chit-chat, directed by Bruno, leads to a discussion of what Bruno considers the perfect murders: each of two strangers kill the other's ""problem"" person, as each killer would have no motive or ties to the person murdered. As Guy and Bruno part, Guy believes Bruno's talk was just social chit-chat, but Bruno believes they have a pact and goes ahead with his murder. Guy knows Bruno committed murder but doesn't feel he can go to the police with the fantastical story, which be thinks will implicate himself more. The situation gets worse for Guy as Bruno starts inserting himself in Guy's life to pressure Guy into keeping to his supposed end of the bargain. Guy must figure out what to do to free himself, not kill anyone, and keep those around him safe. Bruno has Guy's personalized cigarette lighter which he is threatening to use to implicate Guy if Guy doesn't comply with his part of the deal.—Huggo Lost in thought, pondering on what stands in the way of happiness, famous tennis star Guy Haines is recognised on a fast train by eccentric Bruno Anthony. As the perfect strangers exchange pleasantries, with Bruno showing a detailed knowledge of Guy's private life, an ingenious, deadly murder scheme gradually takes shape: Bruno is more than willing to help Guy get rid of his adulterous wife Miriam, and in return, Guy would lend Bruno a hand by doing away with his hated father. Indeed, the methodical plan is perfect in its simplicity. After all, by swapping murders, there would be nothing to connect two strangers on a train. However, does Bruno mean business?—Nick Riganas Psychotic mama's-boy Bruno Antony meets famous tennis player Guy Haines on a train. Guy wants to move into a career in politics and has been dating Senator Morton's daughter Anne while awaiting a divorce from his wife.

Guy takes this as amusing but Bruno is serious and takes things into his own hands.—Col Needham <col@imdb.com> Amateur Tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to divorce his vulgar and unfaithful wife Miriam (Laura Elliott), so he can marry the elegant and beautiful Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), daughter of a senator (Leo G. Carroll).

During lunch in Bruno's compartment, Bruno tells Guy about his idea for the perfect ""crisscross"" murders: he will kill Guy's wife Miriam, and in exchange Guy will kill Bruno's domineering father. Since they are unconnected strangers, there is no identifiable motive for the crimes, and therefore no suspicion from the police. Guy hurriedly departs the compartment, but leaves Bruno thinking he has agreed to the deal by agreeing that the theory is OK and that he likes it just so he can get clear of Bruno. Guy accidentally leaves behind his monogrammed cigarette lighter, engraved 'From A to G' and a gift from Anne, that he lent Bruno. Guy meets Miriam at her work in advance of going to meet her lawyer on the divorce. Miriam calls off the divorce, says she is pregnant with another man's child, and wants to go to Washington and play the political wife. Guy threatens Miriam and the encounter becomes physical until it is broken up. An upset Guy then calls Anne and tells her he wants to break Miriam's neck and could strangle her. Bruno calls Guy on the phone and finds out that the divorce is off and that Miriam has double-crossed Guy. In the background, Bruno's father is talking to his wife about restraining Bruno and getting him under control.Bruno arrives in Guy's hometown and follows Miriam and her two beaus to an amusement park, where he creepily follows the threesome around. He follows them on a boat ride to an island and strangles Miriam to death. Guy is wanted by the police for questioning as he has motive and is the prime suspect. Guy's alibi, a college professor who was inebriated when they met on a train, cannot remember Guy or anything else when tracked down by the police. Guy's chances of being implicated increase when Bruno appears repeatedly around Washington to remind Guy that he is now obliged to kill Bruno's father.Bruno sends Guy the keys to his house, a map to his father's room, and a pistol. Soon after, Bruno appears at a party at Senator Morton's house and hobnobs with the guests, much to Guy's apprehension and Anne's increasing suspicion. Using another guest, he demonstrates how to strangle someone while preventing them from screaming; while doing this he sees Anne's younger sister Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock). Her eyeglasses and resemblance to Miriam trigger a flashback, and Bruno goes into a trance and really begins to strangle the guest before he faints. Barbara rushes to her sister and tells her, ""His hands were on her throat ... but he was strangling me."" Anne notices the resemblance between her sister and Miriam and puts together the facts of the crime and confronts Guy, who admits the truth.Guy agrees to Bruno's plan over the telephone and creeps into Bruno's home at night. When he reaches the father's room he tries to warn the older man of Bruno's intentions, but finds Bruno waiting for him instead. Bruno tells Guy that, because he will not complete his end of the bargain, he should take responsibility for the murder which ""belongs"" to him and pay for the crime from which he is benefiting and to that end Bruno will frame Guy for the murder of Miriam.Anne visits Bruno's house and tells his befuddled mother (Marion Lorne) that her son is responsible for murder, but the woman does not believe her and will not admit how dangerous her son is. Bruno overhears the conversation and tells Anne that Guy had asked him to go to the murder site and retrieve Guy's lighter. Anne tells Guy who knows that he has Guy's lighter and that he now plans to plant it at the scene of Miriam's murder. Anne and Guy devise a plan so that Guy can beat Bruno to the scene of the crime by nightfall while not missing his scheduled tennis match at Forest Hills.Guy wins the tennis match but takes longer than expected; likewise, Bruno is delayed at the Metcalf trains station when he is jostled by another passenger and drops Guy's lighter down a storm drain and must force his arm down the drain to recover it. Guy arrives at the amusement park while Bruno is waiting to get on the boat ride to the island. Bruno has been spotted by one of the amusement park workers who remembers him from the night of the murder and alerts the police. Guy chases Bruno and the two men struggle on the carousel. The police who are following see Guy run and fire on him but the shot hits the carousel operator who hits the controls while falling. The ride spins wildly out of control while Guy and Bruno fight. Guy saves a small boy from falling off the ride while a worker crawls under the carousel to reach the controls. The worker tries to stop the ride but the machinery fails and the ride crashes and Bruno is trapped under part of the ride and mortally wounded. The police are speaking with Guy when the amusement park employee who witnessed Bruno on the night of the murder comes up and says that Guy is not the man he saw, it is the other man that Guy was fighting on the ride. Guy claims Bruno has his lighter and was planning to plant it at the murder site. The police and Guy approach Bruno and Guy begs him to tell the truth. Bruno tells the police that Guy committed the murder, but as he dies, his hand opens to reveal the incriminating lighter. The police arrange to meet Guy the next morning and Guy walks away to phone Anne.
Guy and Anne are on a train when Guy bumps feet with a clergyman seated across from them. The man is reading the sporting news and asks Guy if he is Guy Haines. Guy, remembering this is the way Bruno started their conversation, looks at Anne and they both get up and quickly leave the club car, perplexing the clergyman."

When they arrive at the Dunstan apartment, Buckley's parents Herbert and Doris are already there. The Dunstans announce that they are expecting a baby in November. Everyone is thrilled except Stanley. He feels that being a grandfather will mean that he is an old man. Back home, Ellie excitedly telephones her friends.

She doesn't see Stanley, who has slipped in the kitchen door. How can he tell her the baby is gone?There is nothing else Stanley can do but go to the police station. A stern officer hears his story and tells him they will need to verify it with Kay. Stanley begs him not to do that. At last he is taken to a room where the baby is entertaining a group of officers. He is afraid the baby will start crying but the child breaks into a grin and says ""Grandpa!""From then on Stanley and the baby are inseparable. At the christening, Stanley is delighted to hear that the baby is named for him -- Stanley Banks Dunstan. He fears Herbert and Doris will be upset but they aren't."
