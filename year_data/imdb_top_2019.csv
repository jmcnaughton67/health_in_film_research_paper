With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins due to the efforts of the Mad Titan, Thanos. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers must assemble once more in order to undo Thanos's actions and undo the chaos to the universe, no matter what consequences may be in store, and no matter who they face... The grave course of events set in motion by Thanos, that wiped out half the universe and fractured the Avengers ranks, compels the remaining Avengers to take one final stand in Marvel Studios' grand conclusion to twenty-two films - Avengers: Endgame. After half of all life is snapped away by Thanos, the Avengers are left scattered and divided. Now with a way to reverse the damage, the Avengers and their allies must assemble once more and learn to put differences aside in order to work together and set things right. Along the way, the Avengers realize that sacrifices must be made as they prepare for the ultimate final showdown with Thanos, which will result in the heroes fighting the biggest battle they have ever faced.—Blazer346 Catastrophe. Confusion. Loss. The overwhelming devastation caused by the mad Titan Thanos has left what remains of the Avengers reeling. For a while, all hope seems lost...until an opportunity to reverse the damage is presented. Now, the team must assemble once more and do whatever it takes to restore the universe and bring those they lost back. In the opening, Clint Barton is teaching his daughter archery on his secluded farm while his wife prepares a picnic lunch for them. Suddenly, Clint's daughter vanishes and the rest of Clint's family disintegrates, along with half of all life across the universe, the result of Thanos' snapping his fingers after acquiring all six Infinity Stones. Nebula and Tony Stark are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan, but are returned to Earth by Carol Danvers and reunited with Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, and James Rhodes. The team formulates a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had used the stones a second time to destroy them, preventing their further use. He tells the remaining Avengers that he did so to avoid using the Stones for further nefarious purposes. Enraged, Thor beheads Thanos, saying it's what he should have done in Wakanda.Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm to discover that his daughter Cassie is now a teenager and that Hope van Dyne, along with half of the population, has disappeared in the snap. Rogers has been leading grief counseling sessions for survivors still struggling with the effects of the snap, while Romanoff is tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye, Rocket, and Nebula. Lang goes to Romanoff and Rogers, and explains that while five years had passed for them, only five hours had passed for him in the quantum realm and that time stretches much differently there.The three go to Stark, who is now raising a child with Pepper Potts, and explain their theory that the quantum realm can be used to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Stark initially rejects their proposal with concern about risking his family and the peace he has found, but after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker decides to test theoretical models that would work with Lang's quantum tunnel, eventually finding one that works.With Stark now on board the remaining Avengers set out to reassemble their team. Bruce Banner has now embraced the Hulk as a part of him, and has melded his own consciousness and the Hulk's together into one. Romanoff, after hearing reports from Rhodes of an assassin that operates with similar methods to Barton, leaves to find him. Barton, consumed with grief after the loss of his family, has been operating under the mantle ""Ronin"" while brutally massacring criminal cartels and gangs around the world in order to try and improve the world that's still left. Natasha finds him in Japan and after some convincing, he agrees to rejoin the team in order to try and bring his family back.Banner and Rocket go to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie and the last survivors of Asgard have settled. They there find Thor, who has become overwhelmed by guilt over failing to kill Thanos in Wakanda. Thor has become overweight, his hair and beard are overgrown, and he spends his free time eating junk food, getting drunk, and playing Fortnite with his friends Korg and Miek. Thor begrudgingly agrees to return to the Avengers after some convincing from Rocket and Banner.After testing the quantum time machine on Barton, who confirms that it works, The Avengers are reunited with a plan - Banner, Rogers, Lang, and Stark embark to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space stones during the battle of New York in 2012. Banner goes to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where he is informed by the Ancient One that taking the Time Stone from her time line would prevent Stephen Strange's future efforts to stop Kaecilius from destroying the laws of nature. However, when Banner tells her that Strange gave up the Time Stone willingly to Thanos, she allows Banner to have it, implying Strange had intended for a specific sequence of events to occur for Thanos to be defeated. Banner also promises the stones' return to their proper time lines in order to prevent any ill effects. Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Space Stone after the Avengers confiscate it from Loki.Lang gives Stark's past self a mild cardiac arrest by pulling a circuit in his artificial heart, while Stark steals the briefcase housing the Tesseract when nobody is looking. Their plan is thwarted when Stark drops the briefcase after he is accidentally hit by the Hulk. Loki then steals the Space Stone and uses it to escape custody. Rogers succeeds in stealing the Mind Stone from undercover Hydra agents, but stumbles across his past self, who mistakes him for a disguised Loki.After defeating past-Steve, Rogers meets back up with Stark and Lang, who now must figure out another way to get the Space Stone without running out of the limited supply of Pym Particles that allow them to travel through the quantum realm. Lang returns to the present with the Mind Stone while Rogers and Stark devise a plan to steal the Space Stone from a U.S. Army installation in the 1970s, while also stealing further vials of Pym Particles in order to make the journey back home. While there, Rogers sights Peggy Carter and Stark has an meaningful conversation with his father Howard.Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard to retrieve the Reality Stone before Malekith uses it against the Nine Realms. While in Asgard, Thor is reminded that his mother, Frigga, would die soon and has a chance encounter with her while Rocket steals the Aether, the vaporized version of the Reality Stone, from Jane Foster. The two return to Earth after Frigga counsels Thor and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnor, elated to discover that he is still worthy of it.Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag to steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill does. As Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, Nebula malfunctions and remains on Morag. With two consciousnesses operating on Nebula's systems, Thanos and Ebony Maw discover the presence of future Nebula and go to kidnap her. Nebula realizes what has happened and tries to warn the others, but is too late. Thanos scans her memories and discovers the Avengers' plan, and sends the more loyal past Nebula back to the present as a spy.Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, though are conflicted when Red Skull, keeper of the stone, informs them that it can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. The two fight over which will make the sacrifice, with Romanoff ultimately taking the fall, while a distraught Barton returns to Earth with the Soul Stone.After everyone has returned to the present on Earth, Stark, Rocket, and Banner set out to craft a gauntlet to wield the stones, one constructed from the same nanotech of Stark's latest Iron Man suit. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet and bring back everyone that disappeared in Thanos' snap, reasoning that he can withstand both the gamma radiation and the immense pain and injury brought on by using the stones. He succeeds, though they are almost immediately attacked by Thanos, who has been brought to Earth by the impostor Nebula, destroying the quantum portal in the process.Thanos reduces the Avengers headquarters to rubble, splitting the team up and causing the gauntlet to fall into Barton's protection. The past Nebula is killed by her future self as she attempts to take the Infinity Stones from Barton, while Rogers, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, who decides he will instead use the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and create one in his vision. The three fight Thanos one on one, with Rogers confirming Thor's theory that he is worthy of wielding Mjolnor, but are each bested by Thanos.Soon after Thanos' army lands on Earth, T'Challa appears before Rogers, along with all of the Avengers and other allies revived by Banner, before launching an assault on Thanos and his army. After a lengthy battle during which Stark is reunited with Parker and Quill is reunited with past Gamora, Thanos wrestles with numerous Avengers for the Infinity Stones.When he's bound by Wanda Maximoff's energy, Thanos orders Glaive to have his ship fire multiple energy blasts, nearly devastating the Avengers' efforts. Captain Marvel reappears, taking out Thanos' ship while fighting for control of the gauntlet. Using the nanotech from the new gauntlet, Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from Thanos' hand to his own and uses them to turn Thanos and his entire army into ash, triumphantly stating ""I am Iron Man."" Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from exposure to the Stones' radiation.Following the battle, The Avengers hold a funeral for Stark, whose Mark I arc reactor is floated out on the lake next to his house. Barton and Wanda Maximoff take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision, who did not return in the snap, would be proud of their victory over Thanos. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership for the first time in his life. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned.Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the stones and Thor's hammer to their original time-lines, but decides not to return to the present and to instead live the rest of his life in the past with Carter. He reappears before Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes as an old man, and passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson.A brief flashback shows Rogers and Carter in an ordinary-looking house, finally sharing the dance they never got to have in their living room, truly happy at last."
The Lion King,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6105098/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After the murder of his father, a young lion prince flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. In Africa, the lion cub Simba is the pride and joy of his parents King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Mufasa prepares Simba to be the next king of the jungle. However, the naive Simba believes in his envious uncle Scar that wants to kill Mufasa and Simba to become the next king. He lures Simba and his friend Nala to go to a forbidden place and they are attacked by hyenas but they are rescued by Mufasa. Then Scar plots another scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba but the cub escapes alive and leaves the kingdom believing he was responsible for the death of his father. Now Scar becomes the king supported by the evil hyenas while Simba grows in a distant land. Sometime later, Nala meets Simba and tells that the kingdom has become a creepy wasteland. What will Simba do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The sun rises over the Pride Lands. Animals from all corners of the kingdom head over to Pride Rock (""Circle of Life""). The ruling lions King Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (voice of Alfre Woodard) are welcoming the birth of their cub, Simba. The mandrill high priest Rafiki (voice of John Kani) presents Simba before all the animals, and they all bow before the new prince.A little mouse is scurrying around his environment until he comes across the vicious Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor), Mufasa's jealous brother. Before he can devour the mouse, Scar is interrupted by Mufasa's hornbill major-domo Zazu (voice of John Oliver). He warns Scar that Mufasa is on his way to chastise him for missing out on the ceremony for Simba. Sure enough, Mufasa arrives to confront his brother, just as Scar is trying to make lunch out of Zazu. Scar expresses his dismay for not getting his place on the throne after Mufasa now that Simba is born. After Mufasa and Zazu leave, Scar looks on with scorn.Rafiki is by his tree, where he uses several bugs to form a drawing of Simba on the tree.Time passes, and Simba (now voiced by JD McCrary) is an eager and curious little cub. He wakes up his father so that he can explore the Pride Lands. Mufasa explains that everything in the Pride Lands is theirs, but anything beyond the borders is forbidden from venturing into. He also tells his son that they are connected in the great circle of life in regards to his duty as a future king. Zazu then flies in for the morning report before Mufasa teaches Simba how to pounce on the bird. Moments later, Zazu tells Mufasa that he has spotted hyenas. Mufasa orders Simba to go to Sarabi.Simba goes to Scar, who rests alone on his own little rock. As Simba expresses curiosity over what is beyond the borders of the Pride Lands, Scar tells him that it's an elephant graveyard. Simba then goes to find his best friend Nala (voice of Shahadi Wright Joseph), who is in the middle of a bath. Simba gets his own bath from Sarabi before he tells Nala that he wants to go to the watering hole, but Sarabi makes the cubs take Zazu as a chaperon.On their walk, Simba tells Nala where they are really going. Zazu notices them together and notes how cute it is to see two betrothed cubs together. This grosses out Simba and Nala, who insist they are only friends. Zazu says those are the rules, and Simba says he is going to change some of these rules when he becomes king (""I Just Can't Wait To Be King""). The cubs lose Zazu amidst the other animals before they head to the elephant graveyard. While exploring, they are found by a pack of hyenas, led by Shenzi (voice of Florence Kasumba), Kamari (voice of Keegan-Michael Key), and Azizi (voice of Eric Andre). Shenzi is ready to eat them once she realizes who Simba is, even as Zazu flies in to warn her that doing so would start a war with Mufasa. She attacks, but Zazu manages to hold her off long enough for Simba and Nala to run away. The pack then surrounds the cubs. Simba tries to roar at the hyenas but merely musters up simple growls. As they laugh and ask him to do it again, a louder roar is heard. Mufasa runs in and fights off the hyenas before ordering Shenzi to back off or face retribution. The hyenas retreat, but Mufasa is upset at Simba as he takes him and Nala home.Mufasa has Zazu take Nala home while he talks to Simba. He expresses his disappointment in him, but Simba tries to defend himself by saying that he was trying to be brave like Mufasa. He tells his son that he's only brave when he needs to be, and that he was afraid of losing Simba. They then sit to look up at the stars, and Mufasa tells Simba that the great kings of the past are looking down on them.The hyenas return to their hideout, complaining about their lack of food. It is then shown that Scar is leading them, and he deliberately led Simba and Nala to their path. He then tells the hyenas about his plan to kill Mufasa so that he will lead the Pride Lands (""Be Prepared""), and this will also mean more food for the hyenas.The next day, Scar brings Simba by a gorge to practice his roar. After he leaves Simba alone, he gives to hyenas the signal to make their move. Suddenly, Simba looks up at the cliff to notice a WILDEBEEST STAMPEDE. He runs for it and climbs up a tree for safety. Scar finds Mufasa and Zazu, warning his brother about Simba being trapped in the gorge while telling Zazu to alert the lionesses. Mufasa runs through the herd of wildebeest to reach Simba. He brings the cub up to safety but is dragged away by the wildebeest. Mufasa then starts climbing up the hill, only to be caught by Scar, who sinks his claws into Mufasa's paws. With a sinister look in his eyes, Scar tells Mufasa, ""Long live the king"", and he smacks his brother off the cliff to his demise. Simba watches helplessly as his father falls into the stampede. He runs down and discovers Mufasa's body, tearfully pleading with him to wake up. Scar finds Simba and says it's all his fault that his father is dead. Fearing for the consequences, Simba asks Scar what to do, and Scar orders him to run away and never return. After Simba does so, he sends Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi (plus an unnamed hyena) to chase after Simba and kill him. Simba outruns the hyenas to the edge of a cliff where he and the fourth hyena fall over. Shenzi orders the other two to make sure Simba is dead, but they figure to themselves that he could not have survived the fall, and they are not eager to climb down and check. Simba is seen hiding before continuing his exile.Scar announces Mufasa's death to the lionesses, and then says that Simba was also killed. He feigns his grief before walking up to Pride Rock to assume his new duties as king, and then brings the hyenas out. Zazu and Rafiki watch from a distance and mourn Mufasa and Simba.Simba walks alone for miles before ending up in a desert. He collapses in exhaustion before a flock of vultures swoop in to try and eat him. They are interrupted by the meerkat-and-warthog duo Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), who scare off the vultures before finding Simba. The two decide they should keep the cub so that when he grows into an adult lion, he will be on their side. Simba wakes up and is despondent, still blaming himself for his father's death. Timon and Pumbaa take him in and show him how they live their lives, according to their motto, ""Hakuna Matata"" (It means ""no worries!""). Since the other animals are friends, Simba can't eat them and now feasts on bugs. He spends more time with Timon and Pumbaa, now growing into an adult (now played by Donald Glover).Under Scar's reign, the Pride Lands become devoid of sufficient food and resources, since the hyenas are bleeding everything dry. Nala (now voiced by Beyonce Knowles-Carter) expresses concern over how things have turned. Scar even tries to get Sarabi to be his queen, promising that she can dine with him, but she refuses. He then has the hyenas eat the rest of his kill, leaving barely scraps for the lionesses. Later that night, Nala tries to leave Pride Rock, but she is spotted by Zazu, who knows what Scar will do to her if he catches her leaving. Therefore, he creates a diversion to get Scar and the hyenas to chase him, allowing Nala to get away.After spending a day chowing down on grubs, Simba, Timon and Pumbaa lay down to look up at the stars. As Timon and Pumbaa muse over what could be up there, Simba mentions what Mufasa once told him about the kings of the past looking down on them. Timon and Pumbaa laugh it off, which bothers Simba. He goes to be alone, and as he lays down, some fur from his mane flies off. It is blown away and goes through a few animals before it finds its way to Rafiki. He senses that Simba is still alive, and he rejoices.Timon and Pumbaa are walking through their home while singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" before Nala attacks and chases after them. As they flee, Simba jumps out and pounces on Nala, but after she pins him down, he realizes who it is. Simba is excited to see his best friend again while Nala is elated that Simba is alive. The two go off together to catch up, leaving Timon and Pumbaa to realize that the two lions are becoming more than friends (""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?""). However, the happiness is short-lived once Nala tells Simba that he needs to return home due to what Scar and the hyenas have done. Still feeling guilty, he refuses to go back. Nala leaves him when he becomes too stubborn and doesn't listen to her.Simba wanders off alone until he is found by Rafiki. He tells Simba he knows Mufasa, and that he is alive. Simba follows Rafiki and is led to a lake. Rafiki makes Simba see his reflection, which turns into the image of Mufasa. Up in the clouds, Simba sees and hears Mufasa's voice as his face is illuminated by lightning. Mufasa knows that Simba has forgotten who he is, and therefore has forgotten his own father. He tells him to remember that he is the one true king. Now realizing his purpose, Simba runs off to catch up with Nala, and Timon and Pumbaa follow.The four make it to the Pride Lands and meet with Zazu, who is also happy to see Simba again. They see how bad the land looks, and why it is urgent that they stop Scar. Simba has Timon and Pumbaa be ""live bait"" to distract the hyenas and to let them get to Pride Rock. Simba sees Scar hurting Sarabi when she defies him again. Everyone is stunned to see Simba returning, and he goes by his mother's side. Scar tries to turn the tables on him by making Simba admit his guilt in Mufasa's death. Scar advances toward Simba, causing him to slip and hang over the edge of Pride Rock. Lightning strikes a nearby tree, causing a fire down below. Scar then brags to Simba over how he looks, not realizing he is openly admitting his own guilt for the lionesses to hear. He then whispers to Simba that he killed Mufasa, and Simba pounces on his murderous uncle. Scar confesses to his crime, but then sics the hyenas on the lionesses, beginning an all-out war. The lions battle the hyenas, while Timon, Pumbaa, and Rafiki all get a few good licks in.Simba then goes after Scar, who tries to run away. When Simba confronts him, Scar blames the hyenas and says that he was planning to kill them for their supposed crime. Scar begs Simba for mercy, and Simba orders him to do the same thing he ordered him to do as a cub: run away and never return. Scar seems to agree to the terms, but instead flings hot embers in Simba's face. The two then begin to fight, swinging claws at each other until Simba gains the upper hand and knocks Scar off the edge of the cliff. He survives and sees the hyenas coming toward him. Unfortunately for him, the hyenas heard him throw them under the bus, and they proceed to rip Scar to shreds.The rain falls over the Pride Lands to wash away the fire. With the hyenas gone, the lionesses gather around Pride Rock. Zazu and Rafiki allow Simba his chance to ascend. He walks to the edge of Pride Rock and hears Mufasa's voice saying, ""Remember."" With that, he roars before the lionesses to become the new LION KING.The Pride Lands return to their former glory, looking beautiful and prosperous once more. Timon and Pumbaa have moved in to be close to their friend. Simba and Nala are now king and queen, and Rafiki presents their cub Kiara to the rest of the animals, thereby continuing the circle of life."

While working with Finn and Poe Dameron to fulfill a new mission, Rey will not only face Kylo Ren once more, but she will also finally discover the truth about her parents as well as a deadly secret that could determine her future and the fate of the ultimate final showdown that is to come.—Blazer346 The Skywalker Saga ends here! The galaxy hangs in the balance as Emperor Palpatine has resurrected himself from the Sith planet of Exegol and tries seducing Kylo Ren further into the Dark Side of The Force. Meanwhile, Rey and Finn are desperately trying to figure out The Empire's schemes before they take hold of the galaxy again.—Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 The galaxy is at a crossroads in the final installment of the Skywalker saga. The First Order, now under the shadow of the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, is closing in on the Resistance, and the stakes have never been higher. Rey, the last beacon of the Jedi, continues her training and exploration of her mysterious connection to the Force. Her path is intertwined with Kylo Ren, the conflicted leader of the First Order, and their relationship adds layers of complexity to the unfolding drama. Old friends like Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca join forces with new allies as they embark on a quest across the galaxy. They face challenges, uncover secrets, and learn valuable lessons about courage, friendship, and the importance of understanding one's identity. The film delves into themes of redemption, legacy, and the enduring battle between light and dark. It pays homage to the rich history of the Star Wars universe while introducing fresh elements that propel the story forward.—Evan Almindo The opening crawl reveals that a mysterious broadcast has been heard across the galaxy in the voice of the late Emperor Palpatine. General Leia Organa dispatches agents across the galaxy to gather information on this, while Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, searches for Palpatine in an effort to eliminate all potential threats to his power.He steals an ancient Sith device called a ""Wayfinder"" from the planet Mustafar, and uses it to navigate the galaxy's unknown regions. Soon, he finds Exagol, the mythical home world of the Sith. Sure enough, Palpatine awaits him there, having returned from the dead via unnatural means following Darth Vader's betrayal in Return Of The Jedi - though he still needs to be hooked up to machinery operated by a cult-like group of Sith loyalists to stay alive.Palpatine reveals he has been pulling the strings of the First Order this whole time - he created Snoke to act as a puppet leader, and helped tempt Kylo to the Dark Side. Kylo intends to kill Palpatine like he killed Snoke, but the former Emperor reveals that he has spent the last 30 years constructing an entire fleet of Star Destroyers - each with the power of a Death Star. He tells Kylo that he could be the ruler of the new Galactic Empire if he destroys Rey, and ends the Jedi Order. But he also warns Kylo that there is more to Rey's story than he may realize...Meanwhile, Finn, Poe Dameron and Chewbacca meet with an informant for the Resistance who tells them that there is a spy in the First Order leaking information. He gives them a message in the form of a data encoder, but squadrons of TIE-Fighters arrive and attack them. Finn, Poe and Chewie are forced to flee in the Millennium Falcon, which takes some damage during their escape, but ultimately manages to get away and destroy a number of its pursuers.On the jungle world Ajan-Kloss, where the Resistance is currently based, Rey is learning the ways of the Force from Leia. She expresses frustration at her inability to communicate with the ghosts of the Jedi who came before, but Leia patiently encourages her young student. During her training session, Rey is startled when she has a shared vision with Kylo Ren, due to their Force connection - flashes of scenes from the previous two movies are shown during this scene. She becomes distracted by the vision, and accidentally drops a tree on BB8.The Falcon returns from its mission. Rey, appalled by the state it's in, argues with Poe, who is frustrated that she chooses to stay back at the base training when she's the best fighter the Resistance has. Poe then reveals to the rest of the Resistance that their worst fears have been confirmed: Palpatine is back, and in 16 hours, his massive fleet will be unleashed onto the galaxy. This will be what the Sith Lord calls ""the Final Order"".The Resistance will need to get to Exagol and destroy the fleet before it is released, but C3PO explains that there are no maps leading there. Rey remembers something she read in the Jedi texts from Ahch-To - that Luke had gone on a failed search for a Sith wayfinder (the only other one in existence) sometime before his self-imposed exile. All that is known is that the Wayfinder is somewhere on the desert planet Pasaana. Leia agrees to send Rey there and meet with a contact of hers. Finn, Poe, Chewie, 3PO and BB8 insist on coming along. The heroes say their goodbyes - Finn to Rose Tico, 3PO to R2D2, and Rey to Leia - before departing in the Falcon.Having repaired his damaged helmet, Kylo Ren convenes a meeting of the First Order council. He informs his Generals that there is a spy in their midst. Generals Hux and Pryde stare at each other accusingly. One General expresses skepticism about Palpatine's true intentions behind helping them, but Kylo Force-chokes him and levitates his body aggressively to the ceiling. He then prepares to hunt down Rey with his Knights of Ren.The Falcon lands on Pasaana, and the crew arrive at a vibrant festival. Rey is asked her name by one of the natives, and she replies that she's ""just Rey"". Kylo then reaches out to Rey via the Force and figures out where she is by taking the necklace she was given by the natives of Pasaana. Rey warns her friends that the First Order is coming.The group is then met by Leia's contact, who turns out to be none other than Lando Calrissian. He reveals that many years ago, he accompanied Luke on a mission to track down a man named Ochi, who may have had information regarding the location of the second Wayfinder. They found Ochi's ship abandoned in the desert, where it remains to this day. Lando chose to remain on Pasaana. He gives the heroes directions to where Ochi's ship lies.First Order Stormtroopers arrive, forcing the heroes to flee through the desert. The group ends up sinking through Quicksand, and find themselves in an underground cave where they discover Ochi's remains. Next to him is a dagger that 3PO realizes has an inscription written in the ancient language of the Sith. Unfortunately, his programming forbids him from translating it, much to Poe's frustration. They are then attacked by a giant creature which Rey realizes is injured, and heals with the Force. The creature tunnels an escape route for them out of gratitude.Outside, they find Ochi's ship, but Rey senses that Kylo is near, and goes to hold him off so her friends have time to escape. She damages Kylo's TIE-Fighter, but Chewie is captured by the Knights of Ren along with the dagger, and placed on a First Order transport ship. Rey tries to pull the transport towards her with the Force, but Kylo attempts to do the same. Eventually, a burst of Force Lightning unexpectedly shoots from Rey's hand, destroying the transport. Rey is devastated that she has seemingly killed Chewie, but escapes in Ochie's ship with her friends, while Kylo and his troops steal the Falcon.Finn comforts Rey on the ship, as she is still heartbroken over Chewie. 3PO reveals that he committed the dagger's inscription to his memory, and the group figures out that if they could bypass 3PO's programming, he could translate it for them. Poe says he knows a black market Droidsmith on the planet Kijimi who might be able to do just that. Meanwhile, BB8 befriends another little droid called D-O on the ship.The group lands on Kijimi, and encounter a Spice Runner named Zorii Bliss, who is revealed to be an old friend (and possibly ex-lover) of Poe's. Zorii brings them to Babu Frik, the droidsmith Poe mentioned. Frik says he can bypass 3PO's programming, but in doing so, he will have to wipe the droid's memory. Despite this, 3PO insists on going ahead with it anyway, prepared to sacrifice his memory for the good of the Resistance's cause. Frik hacks into 3PO's memory, and he translates the inscription, revealing that the other Wayfinder is on the remains of the second Death Star. 3PO then reboots, having lost all his memories. Zorii gives Poe a First Order captain's medallion to help them get through the First Order's security.The First Order arrives on Kijimi, having tracked the group there. Rey senses that Chewie is alive on their ship, and realizes he must have been on a different transport to the one she destroyed. The heroes agree to use the medallion to get on board the ship and rescue Chewie and the Falcon.On board the ship, the group is separated - Finn and Poe are captured alongside Chewie. Rey comes across the Sith dagger, and touches it, experiencing a vision that reveals Ochi killed her parents. It seems that he had been sent after her, and her parents sold her to keep their daughter safe. Kylo senses that Rey is on board his ship.Finn, Poe and Chewie are about to be executed by the First Order. However, Hux saves them and reveals that he is the spy - he doesn't care whether or not the Resistance wins, but he is sabotaging the First Order's cause out of spite towards Kylo Ren.Kylo arrives to confront Rey, and finally reveals the truth to her: her father was the son of Palpatine, making her the Emperor's granddaughter. He also reveals that they are connected because they are a ""dyad"" in the Force, and once again tries to convince her to join him. Rey refuses, and escapes on the Falcon with Finn, Poe, Chewie, 3PO, BB8 and D-O.General Pryde figures out that Hux was the spy, and kills him. Palpatine then issues an order for Kijimi to be destroyed by one of his Star Destroyers. The First Order is still able to follow the heroes, because they scanned the dagger and translated its inscription before they arrived.The remains of the second Death Star are located on an ocean moon near Endor. There, the group are met by a tribe of ex-Stormtroopers led by a young woman named Jannah. She and Finn bond over having both escaped from the First Order.Rey braves her way through the perilous ocean to make her way to the Death Star. She gets the Wayfinder, then has a vision of herself as a Sith. Kylo then arrives and destroys the Wayfinder, meaning Rey can only reach Exagol if she comes with him. Rey becomes angered, and they begin a lightsaber duel. For a time, it looks like Kylo is winning - but Leia senses the duel back on Ajan-Kloss.Desperate, Leia reaches out to her son through the Force, causing him to hesitate. Rey takes this opportunity to stab Kylo with her lightsaber - but realizes too late that this also affects Leia, since she and Kylo were connected at the time. Rey heals Kylo with the Force, but is unable to save Leia, who dies back at the base. Distraught, and still haunted by the revelation of her true lineage, Rey steals Kylo's TIE-Fighter and leaves.She returns to Ahch-To, intending to exile herself there as Luke once did. But when she tries to burn the Skywalker lightsaber, Luke's Force Ghost appears and stops her. He tells her that she must not make the same mistake he did, and reveals that Leia knew of her Palpatine lineage all along, but still trained her. He then gives her a lightsaber that was intended for Leia before she gave up her Jedi training because of her pregnancy. Rey remembers that Kylo has the other Wayfinder in his TIE-Fighter and removes it. Luke levitates his X-Wing out of the water (mirroring the scene where Yoda does the same thing in The Empire Strikes Back), and Rey sets a course for Exagol.Meanwhile, Kylo is more conflicted than ever, and racked with remorse over his mother's death. He has a vision of his father, Han Solo, encouraging him to renounce the Dark Side and return to the light. Kylo tosses his lightsaber away, reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo.With Kylo presumed dead, Pryde takes command of the Sith fleet on Exagol, and destroys Kijimi. We also learn that Pryde served Palpatine during the days of the Galactic Empire.Finn, Poe and the others (now accompanied by Jannah) return to Ajan-Kloss, and are informed of Kijimi's destruction as well as Leia's death. Chewie breaks down and howls in anguish over Leia's passing, and Poe is informed that he is to succeed her as General.Poe does not feel that he has what it takes to be the leader Leia was. Lando arrives, and Poe asks him how he, Leia, Han and Luke were able to take on a whole Empire when the odds seemed stacked against them. Lando replies that they had each other, and encourages Poe.R2 backs up 3PO's memory, and then starts receiving a signal from Luke's X-Wing. Realizing it's Rey, and that she is leading them all to Exagol, Poe appoints Finn as his co-General, and prepares to lead a Resistance fleet against Palpatine's Star Destroyers. Lando is sent off in the Falcon to gather reinforcements from across the galaxy.Rey arrives on Exagol and confronts Palpatine, who tells her to strike him down, so his spirit may pass into her. He threatens to destroy her friends if she does not. Rey is about to carry out the deed, but senses that Ben has arrived to help her. The two manage to share Leia's lightsaber via their Force connection, and take down the Knights of Ren together. Palpatine realizes they are a dyad in the Force, and draws life force from them, rejuvenating himself. He declares that nothing will stop the return of the Sith, and tosses Ben down a nearby chasm, seemingly killing him.The Resistance engages in battle with the First Order's fleet, but all seems hopeless, as they are outnumbered and overpowered. Just as Poe thinks the battle is lost, Lando arrives with a massive fleet of ships from across the galaxy. Among the reinforcements are Zorii and Babu Frik (who escaped Kijimi before it was destroyed) and Rebellion veteran Wedge Antilles. Now, the Resistance has their own army capable of taking on the First Order.In Palpatine's throne-room, a weakened Rey lies on the floor. Suddenly, she begins to hear the voices of the fallen Jedi reaching out to her - she hears Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, Aayla Secura, Luminara Unduli, Adi Gallia, and finally, Luke Skywalker, all of whom say that they will stand behind her, and she must rise up to destroy the Emperor and restore balance.Rey gets to her feet, and Palpatine attempts to shoot Force Lighting at her, which she deflects with Leia and Luke's lightsabers. Palpatine angrily says that she is powerless to stop him, and declares ""I am ALL THE SITH!"". Rey responds ""and I...am all the Jedi"", and deflects the lighting back at her grandfather, disintegrating his body and destroying the lord of the Sith once and for all.The effort drains all life from Rey, and she begins to die. Ben crawls out of the chasm and transfers his life force to Rey, reviving her. They share a kiss before he dies, redeemed just like his grandfather before him. Meanwhile, the Resistance destroys the First Order's fleet, killing Pryde.The heroes reunite at Ajan-Kloss. Maz Kanata presents Chewie with one of the medals Leia presented Luke and Han with in A New Hope. Lando offers to help Jannah find her long-lost family. Rey, Finn and Poe embrace, celebrating their victory over the First Order.Sometime later, Rey and BB8 take the Falcon to Tatooine, and visit the now-abandoned Lars homestead where Luke Skywalker was raised by his aunt and uncle. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers there, having constructed her own. A local passes by, and remarks that nobody has come by here in a long time. She asks who Rey is. Rey tells her her name. ""Rey who?"" asks the stranger. As the ghosts of Luke and Leia smile over her, Rey responds ""Rey Skywalker"". She and BB8 then watch the twin suns of Tatooine, just as Luke used to do as a young man - but now, they are rising and not setting."

They set out to find the origin of Elsa's powers in order to save their kingdom. Having harnessed her ever-growing power after lifting the dreadful curse of eternal winter inFrozen (2013), Queen Elsa, the grand conjurer of snow and ice, and her sister, Princess Anna, now enjoy a happy life in the peaceful kingdom of Arendelle. However, a melodious, insistent voice only Elsa can hear keeps her awake, inviting the Snow Queen to a fabled mystical forest. As a result, unable to block the thrilling call of the secret siren, Elsa follows the voice into the perpetually misty realm in the woods to find answers. But, more and more, an inexplicable imbalance hurts her kingdom and the neighboring tribe of Northuldra. Is Queen Elsa's legendary magic enough to restore peace and stability?—Nick Riganas A strange voice beckons to Elsa, causing elemental forces to threaten Arandelle. In order to save their home: Elsa and Anna, with their friends, must journey to the enchanted forest, and discover the truth behind their family, kingdom, and the origins of Elsa's magical powers.—pj artsofdarkness Set three years after the events of the first film ""Frozen , from 2013"" , the story follows Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven, who embark on a journey beyond their kingdom of Arendelle in order to discover the origin of Elsa's magical powers and save their kingdom after a mysterious voice calls out to Elsa. The film opens with young Anna (voice of Hadley Gannaway) and Elsa (voice of Mattea Conforti) playing a game with Elsa's snow creations in an enchanted forest of their own creation. King Agnarr (voice of Alfred Molina) and Queen Iduna (voice of Evan Rachel Wood) enter, and Agnarr tells the girls he has seen an enchanted forest in real life. In his youth, he joined his father, King Runeard (voice of Jeremy Sisto), and other Arendellian soldiers to venture into the Enchanted Forest, where they came to know the four spirits of the forest - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Suddenly, the forest's inhabitants, the Northuldra, started attacking the Arendellians, and Agnarr lost his father before losing consciousness. He recalls being saved by a mysterious being. After he finishes his story, Iduna sings a lullaby to the girls (""All Is Found"").In the present day, Elsa (now voiced by Idina Menzel) hears a melodic voice calling out to her, but nobody else can hear the sound. Anna (now voiced by Kristen Bell) joins Olaf (voice of Josh Gad) outside as he contemplates the changes around him. Anna isn't bothered by changes because she has all the people she loves (""Some Things Never Change""). Meanwhile, Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) tells Sven that he is planning on proposing to Anna.Later that night, the gang plays charades together, but Elsa hears the voice calling out to her again. Distressed, she leaves the room. Kristoff tries to find a good time to propose to Anna, but she is more concerned with how Elsa is acting. After assuring her sister she is going to be fine, they go to bed.The voice continues to call Elsa through the night, leading her to leave her room and wonder what it is that is calling her, and how she wants to learn more about it (""Into The Unknown""). The magic around her shows her images of mysterious creatures. Suddenly, Arendelle begins to experience strange occurrences. A strong wind blows into the kingdom, the water from the fountains drain out, the fire from the lanterns go out, and the earth begins to tremble fiercely. Elsa helps lead the citizens to higher ground.The gang meets with Grand Pabbie (voice of Ciaran Hinds) and the other Trolls. He tells the sisters that the spirits of the Enchanted Forest are angered over a wrongdoing that must be corrected, or else Arendelle's future will be in jeopardy. Elsa decides she must set off on her own to fix it, but Anna refuses to let her go alone. Naturally, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf join as well.Everyone travels far from Arendelle until they eventually reach the outside of the Enchanted Forest, which is surrounded by a gigantic mist. They are pulled inside and find themselves unable to get out. The group gets separated from each other, with Olaf wandering by himself and not understanding the weird things happening in the Forest (""When I Am Older""). A tornado created by the Air Spirit then pulls everyone away, but Elsa tries to stop it with her powers. In the midst of everything, she sees what look like images of memories shown through water. She freezes these images, with one that looks like a young Agnarr, and the Northuldra girl that saved him. The Air Spirit appears to have calmed down, gently blowing across the group, and Olaf even names it ""Gale.""The gang is then approached by a tribe of Northuldra led by Yelena (voice of Martha Plimpton), as well as Arendellian soldiers led by Lt. Destin Mattias (voice of Sterling K. Brown), whom Anna recognizes from a portrait in their castle. They become aware of Elsa's powers quickly, and Olaf even takes time to recap their last adventure together to everyone. Soon, they are attacked by the Fire Spirit, which starts to spread bright colored flames across everything. Elsa once again uses her ice magic to contain the flames. She then follows the Fire Spirit until it appears as nothing more than a little salamander named Bruni. When he sees that Elsa means him no harm, he settles his flames and warms up to her (no pun intended). They hear the mysterious calling once again. After Anna gets Elsa, they run back to the ice statues Elsa made and realize that the girl who saved Agnarr was Iduna, meaning their mother was Northuldra, and the spirits rewarded her deed by giving her a daughter with powers. This revelation allows the Arendellians and Northuldra to form a truce.Kristoff meets a Northuldra reindeer tamer named Ryder (voice of Jason Ritter), and the two of them bond over the way they treat their reindeer (specifically the way they give their reindeer voices). He tells Kristoff that because of the mist, most of the people there have only lived in the Forest and have never seen the outside world. Elsa befriends Ryder's sister Honeymaren (voice of Rachel Matthews), who shows Elsa that in addition to the four main spirits, there is a fifth spirit that acts as a bridge between the other spirits. After witnessing Earth Giants roaming across the land, Anna notices Kristoff is gone, not realizing he is with Ryder, who has tried to help Kristoff come up with an elaborate proposal. She takes off with Elsa and Olaf, which leads Kristoff to think she has gone away after learning this from Yelena. He expresses his sorrow but also how strong his love for Anna is (""Lost in the Woods"").Anna, Elsa, and Olaf continue their journey until they come across the ruins of Agnarr and Iduna's ship. Through the water memories, Elsa learns that they set off to find answers about Elsa's powers, even witnessing their final moments where they embraced as the waters consumed them. They search the ship until they find a map, revealing that their parents were headed for the fabled river of Ahtohallan. Elsa knows she has to go there alone, so she sends Anna and Olaf away on an ice boat that she makes. The two express their anger over Elsa ditching them, even if she did it for their own good.Elsa attempts to get to Ahtohallan across the water, but she keeps getting taken down by the Water Spirit, which appears as a Nokk. After taming the spirit, she rides it as she follows the voice, eager to find out where it's coming from (""Show Yourself""). Once she reaches Ahtohallan, she comes across her own memories and learns that the voice is that of Iduna calling out to her. When Elsa tries to find out what went wrong, she learns the truth: Runeard wanted to subjugate the Northuldra by creating a dam to limit their resources due to their reliance on magic, which Runeard hated. When the Northuldra leader tried to reason with him, Runeard murdered him while he was unarmed. Elsa gets too deep into Ahtohallan, which causes her to turn to solid ice, but not before she sends this information to Anna. Before she and Olaf set off to help, Olaf begins to disintegrate, realizing something is wrong with Elsa. Anna holds Olaf, and they reaffirm their love for each other before he is gone. Anna sits alone in despair until she picks herself up and vows to push forward (""The Next Right Thing"").Anna knows that the dam must be destroyed, even if it means sending a flood toward Arendelle. She goes to wake up the Earth Giants and gets them to follow her toward the dam. Mattias sees this and tries to stop Anna, but after she convinces him that Elsa learned the truth about the dam and why it must be destroyed, he relents and lures the Giants there. The Giants hurl boulders to the dam, which breaks it and sends the water flowing toward the kingdom. Elsa is revived, and she rides the Nokk back to Arendelle where she freezes the water and brings it down before it hits Arendelle, thus saving the kingdom and lifting the mist in the Forest, freeing the soldiers and Northuldra.Elsa reunites with Anna and the two sisters hug. Kristoff and Sven run down there too, and Elsa revives Olaf. Anna and Elsa determine that Elsa is the fifth spirit, as she has become the bridge between the other spirits. Kristoff then finally manages to propose to Anna with something simple, and she excitedly accepts. The Giants then appear to show their respect and gratitude toward Anna and Elsa.After returning to Arendelle, Anna becomes the new Queen, as Elsa has decided to stay in the Forest where she is needed. The sisters regularly keep in touch.Elsa later rides the Nokk back to Ahtohallan for a visit."

After crashing an experimental aircraft, Air Force pilot Carol Danvers is discovered by the Kree and trained as a member of the elite Starforce Military under the command of her mentor Yon-Rogg. Six years later, after escaping to Earth while under attack by the Skrulls, Danvers begins to discover there's more to her past. With help from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury, they set out to unravel the truth.—Blazer346 In 1995, on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, warrior and Starforce member Vers suffers from recurring nightmares involving an older woman. Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, warns her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an organic artificial intelligence who acts as the ruler of the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check.While working with official Ronan the Accuser to rescue an undercover spy, Vers is abducted and subjected to a memory probe by a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree Empire is at war. Vers escapes and, after leaving the Skrulls' ship in an escape pod, crash lands on Earth. Her presence attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her memories and Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Fury later meets and agrees to work with Vers while Skrull commander Talos disguises himself as S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Keller.Using Fury's security clearance, Vers learns she was a pilot who is presumed to have died six years earlier while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by scientist Wendy Lawson, who she recognizes as the woman from her nightmares.

A meeting with felllow pilot Maria Rambeau and her young daughter Monica reveals Vers' real name is Carol Danvers.Talos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. Using the black-box recorder of Lawson's crashed plane, Danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down - and she now remembers Yon-Rogg killing Lawson, as well as Lawson's warning that the experimental engine's energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands.

There they find the source of the energy-core's power, the Tesseract - and some Skrull refugees, including Talos' mate and child. Yon-Rogg's Starforce, having tracked them, captures Danvers and places her in VR before the Supreme Intelligence. Enraged at being used, Danvers fights back, and discovers that a Kree implant that purportedly gave her Kree powers was instead limiting them.Accessing her full force, Danvers escapes, gives the Tesseract to Fury for safekeeping, and battles the Starforce to give Rambeau time to fly herself, Fury, and the Skrulls to Earth - along with Goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a Flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the Tesseract is placed.

Our friendly neighborhood Super Hero decides to join his best friends Ned, MJ, and the rest of the gang on a European vacation. However, Peter's plan to leave super heroics behind for a few weeks are quickly scrapped when he begrudgingly agrees to help Nick Fury uncover the mystery of several elemental creature attacks, creating havoc across the continent.—Sony Pictures Entertainment Some time after Thanos was defeated and Tony Stark's sacrifice, Peter Parker returns to high school. Now, Peter is out to see the world with his classmates and is wanting to take a break from being Spider-Man.

To make matters more difficult, Peter finds himself recruited by Nick Fury and an inter dimensional newcomer named Quentin Beck/Mysterio to help fight them and uncover the truth behind the attacks.—Blazer346 Shortly after the cataclysmic events ofAvengers: Endgame (2019), Peter Parker is yearning for normalcy in a post-Blip world. To blow off steam, Parker and his classmates from the Mid-town School of Science and Technology go on a two-week summer field trip to Europe, and this time, he is determined to ask his crush, MJ, out. However, Nick Fury, the no-nonsense founder of the Avengers, has other plans in store for the sixteen-year-old super-hero, as the Elementals, all-powerful, inter-dimensional creatures formed from the primary elements, start to materialise on Earth, wreaking havoc across the world. Surprisingly, only one man has stood up against this new form of threat and managed to tell the tale: Mysterio, a brave new hero. As humankind's latest adversary threatens to wipe Venice off the face of the Earth, Spider-Man joins forces with Mysterio to lend a hand in the battle, only to make a calamitous mistake. In the end, was Tony Stark wrong about Peter?—Nick Riganas The film opens in a Mexican city, where Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) have arrived to investigate the area after a reported cyclone ""with a face"" had torn through the city. Moments later, the two encounter a being known as an Elemental, specifically the one that can manipulate earth. Fury and Maria are met by a man in a super-powered suit named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), and he helps the two fight the Earth Elemental.Cut to Midtown School of Science and Technology where Betty Brant (Angourie Rice) and Jason Ionello (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr) are doing their daily school news report, but they start with an ""In Memoriam"" dedicated to Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Vision. Betty recaps the events of The Snap (or ""The Blip"", as it is called here from 'Avengers: Endgame'), with many students having been dusted away before returning to life and finding that some of their younger classmates have now surpassed them physically.Peter Parker (Tom Holland) discusses with Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) his plans to win over Michelle Jones/MJ (Zendaya), on whom he has developed a crush. They are prepping for a class trip to Europe, and Peter hopes that he can tell her how he feels.Peter later attends a fundraiser as Spider-Man, with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) there to support him (and we learn that she got ""blipped"" too). They are met by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who appears to be flirting with May. He gives Peter a heads-up that Fury is going to call him, which he does almost instantly, but Peter ignores him since he has other things to worry about. He returns outside as Spidey to talk to reporters, but they overwhelm him with questions about becoming the new Iron Man or the next lead Avenger, so he leaves.The class later heads out for the trip, with Peter choosing to leave the Spidey suit behind to enjoy his vacation, but he later finds that May packed it for him anyway. They are chaperoned by Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J.B. Smoove), and are joined by other students, including Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), who is still a big Spidey fan but also still dumps on Peter. On the plane, Peter tries to get Ned to help him switch seats so that he can sit with MJ, but Ned only causes Mr. Harrington to take Peter while MJ is seated next to Brad Davis (Remy Hii), who is one of the kids that didn't get dusted and grew into a handsome athletic superstar. Peter is clearly jealous, while Ned sits next to Betty, and they end up becoming a couple.The class arrives in Venice, Italy for their first stop. They stay in a crummy hotel, but they take time to enjoy the sights, while Peter tries to get closer to MJ. Suddenly, the water levels on the ground start rising. Soon, a massive Water Elemental begins to wreak havoc upon the city, using water to flood the city or destroy buildings. Peter tries to do something about it, but he left his Spidey suit at the hotel. Beck arrives and uses his powers to fight the Water Elemental. He is able to subdue the creature's attacks before ultimately splitting the creature in two. He is seen as a hero by Peter's classmates, and after watching a news report on him, they start to call him ""Mysterio"".Peter and Ned go back to their room, but Ned gets tranquilized by Fury. He has been trying to get Peter's attention, and it hasn't worked until now. They have to leave the room to talk in private since everyone keeps interrupting them. Fury takes Peter to his secret hideout to meet Maria and Beck. Beck explains that he is from an alternate Earth, which is where the Elementals are coming from. This was supposedly caused by The Snap, and Beck claims that the Fire Elemental was the one that destroyed his home world and his family. Fury wants Peter's help in fighting back, but he feels he isn't the Avenger that is qualified to fight beings like these.Fury hijacks the class's vacation by having his employee, Dimitri (Numan Acar), act as a driver to their new and unexpected destination, Prague, as Fury and Beck have learned that's where the Fire Elemental is set to strike. Before heading out, Peter is taken by a tall woman sent by Fury to give him a stealth suit. She orders him to take off his clothes and put it on, but he is found by Brad, who takes a pic of Peter in what looks like a compromising position. Peter runs after him to get rid of the pic, but Brad says he knows that Peter likes MJ too, and he thinks showing her this will make her lean more toward Brad. On their trip, Peter finds Tony's high-tech glasses, EDITH (voice of Dawn Michelle King) (stands for ""Even Dead, I'm The Hero""), which Tony left for his successor. Peter asks EDITH to handle Brad, which is misinterpreted as a request for an attack. Peter has to (somewhat) discreetly stop the incoming drone from killing Brad, as well as the whole class. He just has EDITH hack into Brad's phone and delete the picture.After arriving in Prague, Mr. Harrington tells the students that they were given tickets to the opera, which ruins their plans to go to the carnival, but it was planned by Fury to keep Peter's friends inside to avoid being caught in the path of the Fire Elemental. Peter is forced to stay outside and be on the lookout, which ruins HIS plan to sit next to MJ. She follows him outside, and Ned and Betty follow since they think the other two are headed for the carnival. Outside, the Fire Elemental emerges and begins to rampage. Spidey and Mysterio team up against the beast, trying to avoid letting it touch metal, or else it will get more powerful. Ned and Betty are trapped on the Ferris wheel as Spidey tries to save them, while Mysterio fights the Fire Elemental. Spidey fires a web at the beast, which pulls something out of it and makes it land near a hidden MJ. Mysterio then uses his powers to dive into the Fire Elemental's chest and destroy it. Peter goes down to make sure he is okay. However, he still gets chewed out by Fury for not doing what he told him to.As the gang moves to Berlin, Peter and Beck are called by Fury and Maria to discuss forming a new team. Peter privately meets with Beck, and Peter thinks that Beck is the one that truly deserves EDITH, since he thinks Tony only left it for him to choose who is worthy of succeeding Iron Man. After Peter leaves, Beck takes down what has been a whole illusion in a dilapidated building. Everyone there works for him, and they are all disgruntled former employees of Stark Industries. Beck has been making up the Elementals to get people to see him as the hero, using drones to create the destruction left behind by their appearances. He and everyone there have been pissed at Tony for stealing their work, his Binary Augmented Retro Framing (BARF), and they have all worked together to get people to forget about Iron Man or Spider-Man, and to make way for Mysterio.Peter goes back to the hotel to invite MJ to go out with him without anybody else. As he tries to tell her how he feels, she cuts him off to reveal she knows he's Spider-Man, due to the many ""coincidences"" involving them being in the same places at the same time. She then pulls out what she found at the site of the Fire Elemental fight, a projector that shows Mysterio fighting the as-yet-unseen Air Elemental. The two realize that Beck is behind the Elementals and that he is a fraud. As Beck and his goons prepare for the Air Elemental ""Avengers level"" attack, they find that the missing projector from one of their drones is in Peter's hands.Peter goes to meet with Fury and Maria about Beck's true motives, but it turns out Beck has caught up to Peter first and has created an entire illusion to trap him in. He taunts Peter for not being the hero he wants to be, and even forces him to endure a projection of Tony bursting from his grave and coming out to terrorize him. It appears as though Fury subdues Beck and asks Peter who else he told about Beck, and he admits that he told MJ, Ned, and that Ned probably told Betty. This turns out to be another one of Beck's tricks, and now he knows to kill Peter's friends. He also puts Peter in the path of a train, which appears to strike him, but Peter is merely hurt really bad, and he passes out on the train.Peter wakes up in a jail cell in the Netherlands. After breaking out, he calls Happy to come get him. While Happy tends to his wounds, Peter breaks down and says that he doesn't get why Tony would pick him as a successor when he keeps screwing everything up. Happy reassures him that Tony believed in him for a reason, and that he knew Peter would be the hero he needs to be. Peter picks himself up and goes to create himself a new suit from Tony's computer before they head to London to rescue his friends.The class is taking a tour bus ride around London, but it's driven by one of Beck's goons. They stop on the London Bridge as Mysterio gets the Air Elemental ready to attack. Spidey shows up in a new suit for battle. Happy goes to get Ned, MJ, Betty, and Flash, but his jet gets blown up and they have to hide in a medieval tower as the drones go after them. They hide in a room, but MJ manages to knock down a drone with a mace before having to stay locked in a room. Spidey enters the illusion of the Air Elemental and webs all the drones together to get them to crash and break the illusion. He proceeds to destroy more drones before Mysterio has him cornered and faces a horde of drones directed at him while under an illusion. Using his Spider-Sense, Spidey dodges all the drones, destroys them all, and in the chaos, one of them shoots Mysterio. Peter goes to get EDITH, but Beck attempts one last illusion to kill him, and it fails, leaving Beck to die in disgrace. Peter then disables all the drones. Afterwards, he and MJ run onto the bridge to meet with each other. They acknowledge their mutual feelings, and they kiss. Fury tries to get Peter again, but Happy tells him to leave the kid alone since he's with his new girlfriend.The students return home. Peter sits Happy and May down to discuss their apparently developing relationship, but while Happy thinks they are an item, May thinks they just had a fling. Peter then goes out to meet MJ for a date as Spidey. He takes her for a swing around the city, although the heights freak her out.Mid-Credits: After their ""date"", Spidey drops MJ off in the streets. They then overhear a breaking news broadcast in the middle of the city. Apparently, Beck recorded a video before his death and sent it to the Daily Bugle. It is shown by none other than the ruthless and antagonistic chief editor J. Jonah Jameson (played by none other than J.K. Simmons), and what plays is a doctored video done by Beck to make people think Spider-Man orchestrated the drone attacks on London. Beck then outs Spidey as Peter Parker to the whole city, leaving New Yorkers in disbelief over their hero, and putting Peter in a very troubling position...Post-Credits: Fury and Maria are revealed to have been the Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his wife Soren (Sharon Blynn). They were ordered by Fury to give EDITH to Peter, and Talos gives Fury an update on what had just happened. Fury is then shown to be relaxing on a Skrull ship, which he is apparently commandeering."

As Aladdin determines to win her heart, he comes across a mysterious oil lamp, which holds a powerful genie, who may be the key to making his dreams come true. As the duo becomes close friends, they discover that the lamp is also being sought by wily Jafar, who intends to use the lamp in an evil plot to take over the kingdom and wage war on the neighboring towns.—Blazer346 Aladdin who regularly steals to get by with the aid of his pet monkey, Abu. One day while roaming the streets, Aladdin spots a beautiful girl who gets in trouble after giving away bread to children without paying. Aladdin comes to her rescue, and together they get chased by the Royal Guards. After a while they elude their pursuers, and Aladdin takes the girl to his place for some tea. The girl calls herself Dalia, and is the handmaiden to the Princess of Agrabah. She suddenly has to leave as another suitor for the princess, Prince Anders, arrives. Dalia happens to be Princess Jasmine and Dalia is the name of her handmaid and best friend. Meanwhile, The Sultan's trusted councilor, Jafar, is plotting to overthrown the Sultan by getting his hands on the Magic Lamp. However, it is hidden in a enchanted Cave of Wonders, and only the ""Diamond in the Rough"" may enter, which he is not. So, he spends weeks searching for this Diamond in the Rough.One evening, after turning down Prince Anders' hand in marriage, Jasmine receives a surprise visit from Aladdin, who has come to return her mother's bracelet, which Abu stole. Still thinking she's Delia, he leaves her with a promise to meet her again, but is caught by the royal guards. The next day, Aladdin finds himself in the desert with Jafar, who assumes that he is the Diamond in the Rough. He tells Aladdin that the girl he met was the princess and that he can make him rich enough to impress her if he helps him retrieve the lamp. By evening, they arrive at the cave, and since Aladdin is the Diamond in the Rough he is permitted to enter the cave safely. The Cave of Wonders is filled with wondrous treasures that tempt both Aladdin and Abu. However, they have been warned to only retrieve the lamp and not to be tempted by the treasure otherwise they would be trapped inside the cave forever. Along the way they meet a Magic Carpet and find the lamp. However, Abu becomes tempted by a big shiny ruby and takes it. This angers the spirit of the cave, and starts to cave in. Aladdin and Abu barely make it back with Carpet's help, but end up trapped in the cave after Jafar takes the lamp and betrays him.Trapped inside the cave, Abu reveals that he stole the lamp back from Jafar. Aladdin notices the lamp is a bit dusty and gives it a rub. This causes the lamp to release a powerful Genie who can grant him three wishes, as long as he is holding the lamp. Aladdin wishes to escape from the cave (though he makes a wish without holding the lamp, keeping his three wishes in tact), and both he, Genie, Abu and Carpet find themselves in the middle of the desert. After seeing Genie's potential, Aladdin wishes to become a prince in the hopes that he can be with Princess Jasmine. Genie transforms him into Prince Ali, and parade to The Sultan's Palace, where the Sultan welcomes him.Aladdin starts off a bit awkward being a prince and trying to impress Jasmine, especially when Genie has him dance spectacularly in front of the princess. Instead of being impressed she just leaves. Meanwhile, Jafar becomes suspicious of Prince Ali.Later, Aladdin decides to go and Jasmine in her room, while Genie takes Delia out for a late night stroll. By just being himself, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a magic carpet ride, where the two of them become close. While watching the village people from above, Jasmine figures out that Ali is Aladdin, but he manages to convince her that he is really a prince and that he dresses as a commoner to escape palace life. Then he takes Jasmine back to the palace and they share their first kiss.The next day however, Jafar captures Aladdin, who has figured out who he really is. He threatens to have him thrown into bay unless he tells him where the lamp is. When Aladdin denies everything, Jafar personally pushes him out of his tower and falls into the sea. Abu and Carpet arrive with the lamp, and Aladdin manages to rub it before drowning. Genie rescues Aladdin, and after speaking with Jasmine they confront the Sultan of Jafar's treachery. Jafar tries to hypnotize the sultan into thinking they are lying, but Aladdin destroys his staff, proving to the sultan of Jafar's treachery. He is taken to the dungeon, but escapes after his parrot sidekick, Iago brings him the keys.Meanwhile, the Sultan thanks Aladdin for revealing Jafar's treachery, and would be happy to have him marry his daughter. This makes Aladdin decide not to use his last wish to set Genie free as he promised, as he believes he cannot keep up being a prince without him. Genie is disappointed that Aladdin wants to continue living a lie and retreats to his lamp. Aladdin goes back to his old home in deep thought, and comes to see that Genie is right. He needs to tell Jasmine the truth. Just then, he realizes the lamp is gone and is now in Jafar's possession.Jafar wishes to become sultan, but when the guards refuse to obey him he uses his second wish to become a sorcerer. He banishes Aladdin to the ends of the earth and threatens to kill Dalia and the Sultan unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. However, Genie sends carpet to find Aladdin and Abu.As they proceed with the wedding ceremony, Jasmine notices Aladdin coming on carpet.

However, Aladdin retorts by claiming Jafar is not as powerful as he wishes to believe. The Genie remains the most powerful being in the universe as he gave Jafar his power in the first place and can also take it away. Realizing what Aladdin says is true and that he is still just ""second-best"", Jafar uses his final wish to become an all-powerful genie. Seeing Aladdin's cunning plan, Genie grants his wish, turning Jafar into a monstrously powerful genie. With phenomenal, cosmic power at his command, Jafar declares himself ruler of the universe.

However, Aladdin decides to use last wish to set Genie free. Genie decides to spend his freedom seeing the world with Dalia, who he has fallen in love with, and have children together.The Sultan has decided to pass his crown onto Jasmine, making her the Sultan of Agrabah.

Joker,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"During the 1980s, a failed stand-up comedian is driven insane and turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City while becoming an infamous psychopathic crime figure. A socially inept clown for hire - Arthur Fleck aspires to be a stand up comedian among his small job working dressed as a clown holding a sign for advertising. He takes care of his mother, Penny Fleck, and as he learns more about his mental illness, he learns more about his past. Dealing with all the negativity and bullying from society, he heads downwards on a spiral, in turn showing how his alter ego, ""Joker,"" came to be.—crisspaggos Struggling to make people laugh in grim early-1980s Gotham City, the mentally ill street clown and failed stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, wears his smudgy makeup every day to eke out an existence. Mocked, bullied, and above all, marginalised, Fleck's slippery grip on reality will pave the way for a gradual descent into a dark world of unrestrained violence, as a loaded revolver enters the picture offering the long-awaited liberation. Then, the medications stopped working, and troubled Arthur's fierce hatred seems to be the only way out. Is the world prepared for the gloriously malevolent advent of the grinned super-villain, Joker?—Nick Riganas Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he's part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.—Jwelch5742 In addition to being a clown at work, Arthur Fleck wants to perform stand-up comedy. He struggles with mental health concerns, some of which include fits of uncontrollable laughter. Because of his troubles and line of work, Arthur is having it considerably harder than other people. Over time, these problems weigh heavily on him, influencing his behaviour and finally leading him to assume the identity of the Joker, for whom he is better known. The story takes place in Gotham City, 1981.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown-for-hire for a company called Ha-Ha's. He struggles with severe depression personally but finds some form of optimism in performing for others and trying to make people laugh. He is tasked with advertising a store by dancing and waving a sign around. On one such occasion, the sign gets snatched by a group of punk teens, forcing Arthur to chase them into an alley. They smash the sign against his face and proceed to mercilessly kick him while he's down.In this era, Gotham is struggling with crime, unemployment, and poverty. Arthur visits a social worker for his medication, as well as his ongoing mental health issues. On the bus ride home, a small child looks at Arthur. He makes silly faces that amuse the boy, but his mother tells Arthur to leave him alone. Arthur begins to laugh hysterically and uncontrollably. When the mother questions him, he hands her a card that explains that he has a mental condition that causes him to laugh the way that he does.Arthur returns home to a high-rise apartment project, where he lives with his ailing mother, Penny (Frances Conroy). After dinner, they sit and watch a TV talk show with host Murray Franklin (Robert DeNiro). Arthur imagines himself being on the show and getting Murray's attention. In his fantasy, Arthur charms the audience and Murray by telling them that he takes care of his mother. Murray relates to Arthur and invites him up on stage in front of everyone, where they share a familial embrace. It is revealed that Penny used to work for Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and is obsessed with the millionaire and has been currently writing to him to try and better their living situation.At Ha-Ha's, Arthur is given a gun for protection by his co-worker Randall (Glenn Fleschler) after he hears about the mugging incident. Arthur is both reluctant and relieved to receive such a gift as firearms are outlawed at work but soon finds his confidence growing after receiving the weapon. However, soon after this, he is confronted by his cold and unfeeling boss, who reprimands him for losing the sign and takes the cost of it out of his pay. Arthur responds only by smiling bitterly.Arthur meets and becomes infatuated with one of his neighbors, a single mother named Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz). She speaks to him politely about relating issues that he can relate to. However, while trying to make an impression with her, he appears awkward and weird around her. At one point, he spends his day following her. Later, she comes by his apartment and asks if he was following her, and he admits that he was, but she doesn't seem put off by it. He invites her to a stand-up comedy show that he is performing at. She is hesitant but is won over by his charm and sense of humor. Arthur watches comedians perform to help him gain some insight into the craft, but feels more awkward and out of place as his over-the-top laughter is not genuine.Arthur goes to the comedy club for his performance. His nervousness consumes him and, as a coping mechanism, unintentionally finds himself laughing so hard that he can barely speak. He then begins going off into his routine, which isn't very funny. Sophie appears to be in the audience... the only person who is laughing at Arthur's jokes. This gives him the comfort he needs to continue to joke despite his inner torment and turmoil.Arthur later goes to a children's hospital to entertain them as a clown. He brought his gun with him, and it falls out on the floor. Arthur's boss later chews him out for this. Arthur pleads for a second chance, but his boss refuses and fires him on the spot. To top things off, Randall throws Arthur under the bus by claiming that Arthur got the gun himself. On the subway train ride home from Ha-Ha's in full clown getup, Arthur spots three drunk young Wall Street types working for Wayne Enterprises harassing a woman. Arthur starts laughing unintentionally and draws the attention of the men, while the woman wisely flees from that car. The men approach Arthur and mock him and his laughter before they start to beat him. Arthur fights back in self-defense, but they team up, and relentlessly beat him to the floor. Having had enough, Arthur then pulls out his gun and shoots two of them dead in self-defense before following the last guy out of the train and murdering him on the stairs.In shock over what he just did, Arthur retreats into a nearby public men's room. After a moment of frantic contemplation, he finds a force rising within him, and he begins to dance by himself. At this moment, he sees himself in the dirty mirror as a battered and smeared and yet powerful clown and begins to embrace it. He hides the gun and then returns to the apartment building where he meets and kisses Sophie for the first time.The news of the three murders spreads, with some seeing it as an attack on the wealthy, while others support the act. Thomas Wayne speaks out and condemns it, labeling the lower class as ""clowns,"" which becomes a symbol they readily embrace. The next day, Arthur cleans out his locker at Ha Ha's but not before confronting Randall about betraying him and breaking the time punching machine. He then leaves, feeling high-spirited and free. News reports show clown rioters protesting through the city and wreaking trouble, condemning the higher privileged. Arthur sees that he has inadvertently caused this and begins to see his true potential, which makes him genuinely delighted.Arthur later finds one of Penny's letters to Thomas, which indicates that Arthur is Thomas' son. Arthur goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson). After performing a magic trick for Bruce, he sticks his hands through the gate and forces Bruce to smile, realizing deep within that they may or may not be brothers. However, Alfred (Douglas Hodge) comes to intervene and tell Arthur to leave. Arthur mentions his mother and her involvement with Thomas. Alfred says he remembers Penny, but that she was lying to him. Arthur attacks and nearly strangles Alfred through the bars but then notices that Bruce is watching. Arthur then gets hold of himself and flees the Wayne premises.That evening, Arthur finds Thomas at a public art theater event. Arthur infiltrates the theater by impersonating an usher. He follows Thomas Wayne into a men's room and tries to confront him with the potential of him being his father. Arthur mentions Penny, whom Thomas also remembers. While Thomas also acknowledges that Penny used to work for him as part of his housekeeping staff, he says that she was delusional and that there's no way Arthur could be his son. Thomas also explains that Penny never told Arthur that he was adopted, which Arthur strongly rejects before uncontrollably laughing in Thomas's face. Thomas, unaware of Arthur's condition, becomes defensive and punches Arthur in the face before having him thrown out of the building. Arthur returns home, where he tortures himself by slamming his head on the refrigerator in a fit of depression and longing.The next day, two police detectives, Burke (Shea Wigham) and Garrity (Bill Camp), go to Arthur's apartment to question him on the subway murders due to the word that the suspect was wearing clown make-up, and they know Arthur lost his job earlier that day. Arthur denies any involvement and gets the detectives to leave. Not long after, Penny falls ill and is hospitalized. Sophie sits by Arthur as he tends to his mother. In the hospital, Arthur sees that Murray's TV show is playing a clip from his stand-up routine, but he is hurt to see that Murray only played it to mock Arthur.Arthur later receives a phone call from a rep for Murray's show. He is invited to appear as a guest, which Arthur reluctantly accepts. After studying other interviews on the comedy show, Arthur decides to commit suicide in front of the live audience, thinking it will make them laugh.Seeking hard proof, Arthur goes to Arkham Asylum and speaks to a clerk, named Carl (Brian Tyree Henry), who has a file on Penny. When Carl says he can't give Arthur the info he wants, Arthur snatches the file and runs away to read it. Once away and hidden in a stairwell, Arthur opens the documents and reads them, finding that Thomas was telling the truth... according to the documents. The reality is that Penny adopted Arthur after he was found abandoned as a baby, and she abused him, tying him to a radiator and beating him alongside her abusive boyfriend. One part of the file mentions Arthur having a head injury, which is most likely what caused his laughing condition. Arthur returns to the hospital and tells Penny that he thought his life was a tragedy, but he sees it's a ""fucking comedy."" With that, he smothers Penny to death.Arthur goes back home and breaks into Sophie's apartment. She sees him and is terrified, asking him to leave for the sake of her daughter. Arthur asks her if she has ever had ""a really bad day,"" to which she replies that she doesn't even know him. Through this, it is revealed that every other moment featuring Sophie was just in Arthur's head. A broken and frustrated Arthur apologizes for his intrusion and leaves Sophie alone, storming out of her apartment.Arthur starts to get ready for his appearance on Murray's show and paints his face white. He is visited in his apartment by Randall and another former co-worker, a dwarf named Gary (Leigh Gill). They offer condolences after they hear about Penny's death, but then Randall begins mentioning Burke and Garrity going to their apartments to question them about the subway murders. Arthur realizes that Randall is only seeking a way to use Arthur in order to cover his own butt and then snaps, brutally stabbing Randall twice in the face before smashing his head against the wall. A terrified Gary questions Arthur's deeds and begs to be let go. Arthur agrees to before playfully scaring him as a prank. Gary tries to undo the lock on Arthur's door but is unable to due to his height. He asks Arthur to open the door for him to which Arthur immediately agrees, pausing once to thank Gary for being the only person in his life who was nice to him. Arthur kisses Gary on the forehead and lets him go.Arthur then dyes his hair green, puts on full clown make-up, and dons a burgundy suit. He then dances down the stairways, fully embracing his insanity and carefree life. Burke and Garrity find Arthur dancing in the street and move in to arrest him. Arthur runs, and they chase him into the subway train where dozens of other Gotham citizens are dressed like clowns after being inspired by the murders. Arthur hides his face with a clown mask, which he steals from a protester and inadvertently starts a brawl in the train cars. As the detectives pursue Arthur, one clown gets in the way, and Burke accidentally shoots him dead when they struggle with his gun. The clowns pull the detectives out of the subway and start beating them relentlessly, allowing Arthur to get away, moving smoothly through the police forces which swarm the area.At the TV station, Arthur meets Murray and his agent Gene (Marc Maron). Before he goes on, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as ""Joker,"" since Murray referred to him as such when playing his clip. Murray asks Arthur if his clown make-up has political agendas behind it to which Arthur replies, ""I don't believe in that. I don't believe in anything."" While waiting to be introduced, Arthur sees Murray broadcasting a clip of a struggling Arthur trying to tell a joke. This causes Arthur's mind and plans to change, and then he dances out into the spotlight.Arthur goes out as the show begins. He awkwardly tells Murray a joke, which he finds funny for its dark humor though nobody else does. After being confronted with this, Arthur continues by admitting to the subway murders. Murray and the audience slowly realize that Arthur is serious. Arthur argues that the audience only cares for the victims because Thomas Wayne spoke for them, but anyone else like Arthur would be ignored and walked over. Murray and the audience grow angrier with Arthur, but so does he. Murray scolds Arthur, which escalates into Arthur snapping and telling another joke, grinning giddily. ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?!"" he asks, only for Murray to try shutting him off before calling for the police. An enraged Arthur then screams, ""You get what you fucking' deserve!"" before blowing Murray's brains out in front of everyone. The audience runs away in terror, and the news of the murder immediately hits the airwaves. Arthur then laughs genuinely for the first time in his life.Gotham is now overrun by rioting citizens dressed as clowns after hearing about what Arthur did. The Waynes leave a movie theater to find the chaos in the streets. Thomas takes his wife Martha (Carrie Louise Putrello) and Bruce into an alley, but one clown follows them and tells Thomas he is getting what he deserves using the punchline that Arthur used on the Murray Franklin show. With that, he shoots Thomas and Martha dead in front of Bruce.Meanwhile, Arthur has been arrested and is being taken by the police. Arthur looks out the window and laughs gleefully as he sees the destruction and chaos he has caused. Just then, the clowns in an ambulance run into the car, killing the cops and freeing Arthur, who is injured and unconscious. When he awakes, Arthur finds himself surrounded by a mob of cheering mobsters in clown masks. The rioters then cheer Arthur on as he stands on a car and embraces their admiration, now that he has gotten the recognition he has long desired. He dances to their cheering and then pauses, finding that his nose is bleeding profusely. He then spreads the blood across his upper lip and grins before standing before them, elevated like a god.Sometime later, Arthur is locked up in Arkham Asylum. He laughs after telling this story and visualizes a young Bruce standing over his parents in the alley. Realizing that he has, in a way, turned Bruce into himself, Arthur laughs some more, finding this genuinely hilarious. He meets a new social worker (April Grace) and says he wants to tell her a joke, but she wouldn't get it. A few minutes later, Arthur then steps out of the room, leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind before he is chased around by orderlies."

Further complicating matters, the damaged game has inadvertently sucked in Eddie and Milo too, with them respectively playing the two remaining avatars, Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart) respectively, and Bethany has been left behind.After Fridge loses his first life thanks to being eaten by an anaconda, NPC guide Nigel Billingsley (Rhys Darby) arrives in a plane and gives the players their new mission: evil conqueror Jurgen the Brutal, (Rory McCann) the murderer of Bravestone's parents has stolen a gem known as the Falcon Jewel which guarantees good harvests. The four adventurers must reacquire the jewel and ""show it to the sun"", calling out Jumanji's name to win.After Nigel drops the players in a desert, they are attacked by a herd of ostriches, barely making an escape in an abandoned dune buggy. It quickly becomes apparent that Eddie's stubborn impulsiveness and Milo's penchant for making long-winded explanations is endangering the group, as proven when Milo takes too long to exposit about the ostriches' biology, resulting in Eddie losing his first life when he confronts one of them.Upon arrival at a place called the Oasis, the team runs into Spencer, who is now a female cat burglar named Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina). Eddie inadvertently costs Spencer his first life by capturing him and giving him to Jurgen the Brutal, who executes Spencer by beheading him, though Spencer thankfully respawns nearby. Following the clues given to them, Fridge and Martha obtain a desert fruit called the Jumanji Berry while discovering a pool of green glowing water which allows them to exchange avatars.As Spencer and Milo search for camels for the group to ride, Eddie gets into a brawl with about 45 strangers. The battle draws the attention of Switchblade, a mercenary who is Bravestone's sole weakness. Using a rocket launcher, Switchblade kills all the players with a single shot, costing each one of them a life. Riding the camels to their next destination, the team is slowed down when Eddie and Milo argue about the latter's choice to retire from the restaurant business, a decision which angered the workaholic Eddie. The fight ends when Eddie crushes Milo beneath a rock, costing Milo his second life.Eventually, the group arrives at the next level: a series of moving rope bridges spanning a canyon. It is not long before they encounter a horde of angry mandrills, which hound the players and attempt to hurl them off the bridges. Although Fridge is able to guide the team across using his avatar's geometry skill, they are ultimately surrounded on the other side by the vicious primates, and Martha loses her second life when she's tossed into the canyon by the mandrills at one point. At the last moment, they are rescued by Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks), whom Bethany has recruited. He's playing once again as Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough (Nick Jonas), while Bethany is now playing as a black horse named Cyclone. The two of them have brought along winter gear for the others to wear.Eddie and Milo reconcile, with the latter explaining that he is terminally ill and wishes to make amends with Eddie before he dies. As the group prepares to confront Jurgen at his mountain fortress, Fridge tells everyone that the mismatched avatars have been a major liability up to this point. Spencer's neuroticism isn't really well suited to a thief like Ming, Milo's long-windedness means he takes too long to explaining the threats any wild animal can pose to them, and Eddie is too hotheaded and impulsive to be Bravestone. Shortly after this, Fridge accidentally stumbles upon a river flowing with the mysterious glowing water he and Martha saw at the Oasis. All of the characters take the plunge save for Martha and Alex, resulting in Spencer, Fridge and Bethany being returned to their original avatars, while Eddie is now playing Ming and Milo is now playing Cyclone.Unfortunately, the two old men are captured by Jurgen's men shortly afterwards, leaving the original team of five to rescue them. Infiltrating the mountain fortress, Alex loses two of his lives to the booby traps trying to rescue Milo, while Fridge and Bethany pose as a pair of famous brothers Jurgen is expecting. Meanwhile, Spencer and Martha rekindle their relationship while finding and freeing Eddie.Inside the fortress, Martha battles Jurgen's goons to music while Spencer pursues the fleeing Jurgen. Confronting the conqueror aboard his zeppelin, Spencer deduces that the Jumanji Berry is Jurgen's weakness, using it to subdue and defeat the villain. Below, Cyclone is revealed to be a flying horse, which leads to Milo carrying Eddie to meet Spencer in midair. Spencer tosses the Falcon Jewel to his grandfather, who points the gem at the sun as instructed by Nigel. Their mission accomplished, the whole team cries out ""Jumanji"", ending the game.Nigel arrives to send the players home, but Milo expresses his wish to stay in the game. Eddie bids him farewell, understanding his motivations and thanking him for their friendship. Spencer in turn thanks his friends for coming for him, whereupon Fridge tells him not to do it again. Everyone returns safely to Spencer's basement, and Eddie changes his mind about growing old, saying to Spencer that it is in fact ""a gift"".Spencer and Eddie finally go to Nora's, where it is revealed that the diner's current owner is actually Nora Shepherd, the aunt of Judy and Peter and an old friend of Eddie's. Using the lessons he learned as Bravestone, Eddie begins to flirt with her, smoldering intensely as he does so.In a mid-credits scene, Spencer's mother calls in a repairman to fix the basement heater, who stumbles across the game and its console. Back at Nora's, a herd of ostriches stampedes past the diner, shocking Spencer and his friends."
It Chapter Two,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7349950/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back. Defeated by members of the Losers' Club, the evil clown Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize the town of Derry, Maine, once again. Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise -- now more powerful than ever. Derry, Maine. A small town with a terrible curse. Every 27 years, an ancient being comes up from the sewer depths to feed off of the fear of children. Since it's defeat in 1989, Pennywise has grown hungry, and is now back with a vengeance. If the losers club doesn't defeat him this time, their worst fear will become a reality, with nothing to stop him. The clock is ticking. Who's going to be scared first? After the survivors' irrevocable blood oath inIt (2017)--and nearly three incident-free decades after the blood-soaked encounter with the demonic shape-shifter, Pennywise the Dancing Clown--the estranged members of the Losers' Club find themselves before a dreadful obligation: to return to Derry and honour their promise. Once again, the brutal murder of an innocent awakens the grisly memories of the past, reuniting the old band of companions, as the nightmarish monster has come back from the shadows of oblivion to terrorise the small town, intent on revenge and slaughter. Now, whether they like it or not, the now-successful Losers must probe deep into the fundamental fears of their troubled childhood, and summon up the courage to bring the terrible creature's reign of terror to a close. One last battle awaits Derry's remaining fighters of the supernatural. Will this final confrontation mark the end of the Losers Club, or will it be the end of the dreadful thing they call IT?—Nick Riganas This sequel to the 2017 film opens in 1989. Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell), Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis), Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef), and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016, a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival, the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner, and when he arrives at the scene, he discovers the message ""COME HOME"" written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter, but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman, Myra (Mollie Atkinson), who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect, though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer, married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone, and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call, and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends, but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike's name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn't go is Stanley, as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home, police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry's father and deduced that he murdered him. Today, Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague), who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce, but also note Stanley's absence. They start to split fortune cookies, only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev's fortune reads ""Stanley"", and put together, the fortunes read ""Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It"". The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table, which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant, Bev calls Stanley's wife. Before she can say what happened, Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub, and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying, and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died, and she says she has seen how they all die, as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike's house, where Mike drugs Bill's water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry, he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud, which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers, and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry, we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly, and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful, and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends, as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away, only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There, they find an artifact for Stanley, which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes, as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her, although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh, the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh's chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is ""daddy's little girl,"" as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away, she sees Pennywise in his human form as ""Bob Gray"", who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback, he is seen playing a game with Henry's cousin, and the bully teases Richie for being a ""fairy"". Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise, who claims to know his ""dirty little secret."" He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie, but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill's work, but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street, passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away, he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler), whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie's stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page, in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev's form to ridicule Ben for his weight, as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev, and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form's head took fire as Ben hid in a locker, only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest, albeit non-fatally, and he runs to his friends for help. However, Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting, Bill sees the message ""The fun is just beginning"" written, which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant, itself a line from Richie's stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean, and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors, but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise, who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean, but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy, blocking Bill's view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after, Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there, they make it into Pennywise's lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts, being Bev's poem, Ben's yearbook page, Richie's token, Eddie's inhaler, the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie, and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts, but just when it seems that things worked, out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form, as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face, and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked, and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions, including one of Stanley's severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with ""Scary"", ""Very Scary"", and ""Not Scary At All"" for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom's body, as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile, Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other, and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene, Gretta, Henry, and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking, and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie, as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died, as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn't go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years, and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun, but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise, with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie, however, Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there, and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider, he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it, destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out, but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it's so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend, and the others console him. As they continue to swim, Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home, they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves, including Eddie and Stanley. One last flashback shows the group as kids riding their bikes home.Later on, Bill has gone back to work with writing, and he feels his endings are getting better. He speaks on the phone to Mike, who is thinking about finally seeing the rest of the world. They tell one another that they love each other, and Mike mentions a letter that all the Losers have been getting. Bill finds his letter and sees that it's from Stanley, written before his suicide. We hear his voice reading the letter over a small montage of the other Losers in the present. Ben and Bev are now in a relationship, while Richie goes to a bridge where he carved his and Eddie's initials, revealing that he was in love with him. Stanley's letter states that he knew he could never be brave enough to face Pennywise again, so he removed himself from the equation to give his friends a chance to honor him, which would give them the strength to fight IT. He turned out to be right.The film concludes with Mike driving away and finally leaving Derry."
Us,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6857112/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A family's serene beach vacation turns to chaos when their doppelgängers appear and begin to terrorize them. In order to get away from their busy lives, the Wilson family takes a vacation to Santa Cruz, California with the plan of spending time with their friends, the Tyler family. On a day at the beach, their young son Jason almost wanders off, causing his mother Adelaide to become protective of her family. That night, four mysterious people break into Adelaide's childhood home where they're staying. The family is shocked to find out that the intruders look like them, only with grotesque appearances.—jesusblack-30225 Not far from the sun-kissed Santa Cruz beach where a traumatic experience shaped her, Adelaide, now a mother of two, reluctantly returns to the serene lake house of her childhood to spend the summer vacation with her husband. But after all this time, Adelaide still can't shake off the ominous feeling that the terrifying incident will somehow affect her unsuspecting family. And before the end of the day, the happy holidaymakers' worst fears will come true. Now, an evil quartet bearing an uncanny resemblance to them has set foot in their driveway. Then, their sharp scissors enter the picture. What do ""they"" want from them?—Nick Riganas Santa Cruz, California. 1986A young Adelaide (Madison Curry) goes to the beach on a trip with her parents Rayne and Russell (Anna Diop and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). After Russell wins Adelaide a Michael Jackson 'Thriller' T-shirt at a carnival game and plays Whac-a-Mole, Adelaide wanders off and encounters a homeless man with a Jeremiah 11:11 placard and then walks into a nearby fun-house. Inside, she's terrified by the mirrors and vibe of the place and eventually comes face to face with an exact doppelganger. The incident scares her. Some time later, Adelaide is refusing to talk as her parents worry about her. The therapist tells them to make Adelaide tell her story through the form of anything - reading, writing, or dance.In the present day, an adult Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) goes on a beach trip with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and their two children 12-year-old Zora (Shahidi Wright Joseph) and 10-year-old Jason (Evan Alex). While the family has lunch at their beach house, we find out several things - one is that the beach trip was to help the children cope with the death of their grandmother and the other is that Adelaide appears to still be terrified of the idea of going to the beach because of what happened before and refuses to go. After some persuasion, however, she reluctantly agrees to join her family to go to the beach. On the way, the family sees a man being brought into an ambulance - it is the same homeless man that Adelaide encountered many years ago with the Jeremiah 11:11 placard.At the beach, the Wilson family meets their friend the Tylers, comprising of Kitty (Elizabeth Moss), Josh (Tim Heidecker), and their twin teenage daughters Gwen and Maggie (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). While the kids are all at the beach, Kitty and Adelaide talk about Adelaide's soft-spoken nature and her past as a young ballet dancer. Jason soon wanders off on his own and finds a man with his arms stretched out dripping with blood. Adelaide notices her son missing and panicking, eventually finds Jason and decides that it's time for the family to go back to the house.Later that night, after the family settles down, Adelaide tells Gabe all about her childhood trauma and worries that recent events mean that her doppelganger is coming to get her. Gabe tells her not to worry... and almost instantly, the power goes off. As Gabe is about to run the backup generator, Jason alerts the family that there's a family in their driveway. Adelaide quickly calls 9-1-1 while Gabe attempts to scare the family off. Eventually, the family begins entering the Wilson's house, and one of the figures hits Gabe with a baseball bat while everyone else corners them in the living room.Inside the living room, the Wilsons get a better look at the family... and it is all doppelgangers of themselves... all of them wearing red jumpsuits and wielding a pair of scissors. Adelaide's doppelganger tells them of a story of a princess and her shadow and their relationship, before forcing Adelaide to handcuff herself to the table. She then makes Zora run away from the house with her doppelganger in hot pursuit, makes Jason join his to play, and has Gabe's drag him off to a boat. (Note: for posterity's sake, although their names are never explicitly used, the doppelgangers are referred to by their names in the closing credits - Adelaide's is Red, Gabe's is Abraham, Jason's is Pluto, and Zora's is Umbrae.)From this point on, we encounter the family dealing with their doubles in several ways.After running far away, Zora thinks she's outrun her doppelganger Umbrae... only for her to appear on the top of a car. A neighbor spots the commotion and confronts them... but Umbrae murders him with her scissors while Zora escapes.Abraham drags an unconscious Gabe all the way to the family's boat and then places him inside a bag. Gabe eventually awakens and successfully throws Abraham overboard. Later on, however, the boat engine fails, and Gabe falls in the water. He ultimately makes his way back to the boat... only for Abraham to emerge and grab him. After a fight, Gabe manages to turn on the boat's engine in time, completely eviscerating Abraham.Back at the house, Jason leads Pluto inside a closet and notices that he mirrors his actions almost simultaneously. He takes off his mask and finds that the lower half of Pluto's face is burned off. Jason impresses him with a magic trick, but when Pluto demands that he do the trick again, he successfully traps him in the closet and escapes.Meanwhile, Red holds Adelaide hostage in the living room and begins trying to slam her face against the glass table, but the commotion caused by Jason's escape leads her away. In a panic, Adelaide manages to get the fireplace poker, destroys the leg of the table, and get Jason. They are both reunited with Zora and Gabe, and the Wilsons manage to escape on the boat with Red and Pluto watching them.At the Tylers, Kitty thinks she sees something outside. Josh pretends that he does see it, only to reveal that he's just messing with her. The twins then come out of their rooms and talk, and the second they think that everything is alright...a set of doppelgangers wearing red jumpsuits, similar to the Wilsons, all emerge and kill the whole family. When the Wilsons arrive looking for help, Kitty's double drags Adelaide into the house while Gabe attempts to distract Josh's double. After a fight, the Wilsons manage to kill all of the Tylers' doppelgangers and reunite inside the house.The Wilsons turn on the TV and find out from frantic news reports that the red-clad doubles have been inexplicably appearing and killing people all over the world, and have joined together to hold hands (similar to Hands Across America). Gabe wants to take refuge in the house, but Adelaide says they have to keep moving and escape. The family decides to take the Tylers' car, but when Adelaide looks for the key, a still-living Kitty's doppelganger attacks her. She manages to kill her, but when the family gets to the car, Umbrae appears. After a chase sequence, they manage to kill Umbrae when they speed up and abruptly stop the vehicle, causing her to fly into a tree.It is now morning, and the Wilsons get to the boardwalk. At the boardwalk, they see their original car burning with Pluto standing in front. Adelaide decides to get out and walk to him... and soon realizes that it's a trap. Jason acts fast and makes Pluto walk backwards into the burning car, and just as the family thinks it's over, Red grabs Jason.Adelaide runs after them, while Zora and Gabe see that the beach is now full of red-clad doppelgangers joining hands. Adelaide makes her way back to the fun-house and goes all the way down into an underground tunnel with rabbits roaming free. She finds Red inside one of the many rooms, and Red explains her plan. Red says that all this time, the underground facility (presumably a part of the dimension of Hell) has been filled with everyone's doppelgangers, and now it is their time to be on the surface. She says that she has always been a part of Adelaide, and when she was a ballet dancer as a kid, it led her out of the tunnels and into the fun-house where they met. It took her a long time, but a plan was made with everyone in the tunnel which was now being executed.After a fight, Adelaide manages to overpower Red and kills her by impaling her to the fireplace poker and gets Jason back. The family reunites and drives away. All is good, and everyone looks relieved until a quick flashback shows that when ""Red"" met Adelaide in the fun-house all those years ago, she knocked her out, took her Thriller T-Shirt, and went off into the real world. The ""Adelaide"" we've been watching for the whole movie is actually the doppelganger, and ""Red"" was simply the real Adelaide getting her revenge (this also explains why ""Red"" is the only one of the doubles to have concrete speech while all the other doppelgangers in the film have guttural, animalistic sounds). Jason appears to realize the truth, and puts his mask on uneasily.The film ends with a zoom out showing all the red doppelgangers around the United States joined together, holding hands (similar to Hands Across America), with news and police helicopters surveying them from above."
Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6806448/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Lawman Luke Hobbs and outcast Deckard Shaw form an unlikely alliance when a cyber-genetically enhanced villain threatens the future of humanity. This stand-alone 'Fast and Furious' film opens in London, England where a team of MI6 agents led by Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby) storm a warehouse to retrieve a deadly virus called ""The Snowflake"". They are found by the super-enhanced Brixton Lore (Idris Elba). Because of his cybernetic augmentations, he is able to sense incoming attacks, which allows him to wipe the floor with all of the other agents. Hattie injects her right hand with the Snowflake and escapes from Brixton's sight. He grabs a radio and makes it seem as though Hattie is a traitor who took the virus for herself.Meanwhile, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wake up in their own homes in Los Angeles and London. They go about their daily routines before later going to separate nightclubs to beat the crap out of dozens of goons before they each find one to interrogate. Both Hobbs and Shaw have heard about the super virus that has been going around, and they know it has been manufactured by a terrorist group called Eteon. Their respective goons fail to give them the info they want, so Hobbs tattoos ""I Love Cops"" on his forehead while Shaw leaves his guy dangling out a window.Hobbs has breakfast in a diner with his daughter Sam (Eliana Sua) when he is visited by an old friend/CIA agent Locke (Ryan Reynolds). He informs Hobbs about the Snowflake and just how serious of a threat it is. Although reluctant to help, Hobbs agrees to do so. At the same time, Shaw goes to visit his mother Magdalene, AKA ""Queenie"" (Helen Mirren), in prison. She tells him about Hattie's predicament and that he should reach out to her, but he doesn't think Hattie wants to see him. After leaving the prison, Shaw is approached by Agent Loeb (Rob Delaney) to also go after the Snowflake. This leads Hobbs and Shaw to come face-to-face once again with Locke and Loeb asking them to work together. Their response? ""No FUCKING way!"" After exchanging insults, the two begrudgingly agree to work together. The other agents track Hattie down for the guys to go after her.While Shaw goes to Hattie's booby-trapped home, Hobbs manages to find her on the streets. She fights Hobbs to get away, while Shaw is fought by agents trying to track Hattie. He beats them all across the room, while Hobbs manages to gain the upper hand and bring Hattie in.Hattie is taken back to the CIA headquarters for questioning by Hobbs. Shaw shows up and informs Hobbs that she is his sister. She tells them that she is carrying the virus, just before Brixton shows up and attacks. Shaw recognizes him as an old colleague that he supposedly killed years earlier. Brixton attempts to take Hattie with him by going down the building with a harness, but Hobbs and Shaw pursue. Hobbs slides down the harness to get rid of Brixton's goons before giving Hattie a chance to get away. Hobbs fights Brixton, only to discover he is no match for the superhuman. Shaw drives by to pick up Hobbs and Hattie, and Brixton chases after them on a motorcycle, but the heroes lose him after he crashes through a bus. The three then see that Eteon has manipulated the media into declaring them all fugitives and traitors. Hattie goes off to try and find Professor Andreiko (Eddie Marsan), the creator of the Snowflake and the one who can extract the virus from her. Hobbs shows that he was tracking Andreiko before the attack, and they manage to locate him at a newsstand.Brixton returns to Eteon's headquarters to get more juiced up. He speaks to Eteon's mysterious leader, who knows of both Hobbs and Shaw and wants Brixton to have them join Eteon.The trio talk to Andreiko, who says that he developed Snowflake for Eteon, but he left them after realizing their plan to use it on humanity and then force them to be fixed by Eteon. He tells them that the only way to get it out of Hattie is to kill her or extract it from her through a facility in the Ukraine. Shaw uses some of his own gear to help keep himself, Hattie, and Hobbs from being tracked or recognized. They head to Moscow using fake names, with Hobbs getting ""Mike Oxmaul"" and almost getting detained for it. While on the plane, Shaw tells Hobbs to back off of Hattie since he can tell that he is attracted to her. Hobbs taunts Shaw with the prospect of him hooking up with his sister, but their bickering wakes up the air marshal, Dinkley (Kevin Hart). He figures that the two are on a mission, and he bemoans his lack of action. Dinkley gives them his card for whenever they need something.In Moscow, the trio visit an old flame of Shaw's, Margarita, AKA Madame M (Eiza Gonzalez), who is the leader of an all-female crew of criminals that rob peoples homes. She provides them with weapons and gear that they need to storm the Eteon facility. Margarita then takes them to the facility where she makes it look like she is giving Hattie up to Brixton, who is already there after interrogating Andreiko. Hobbs and Shaw sneak their way around the place after dropping in from a jet. They encounter armed goons and proceed to pummel all of them in separate halls. They then use the unconscious goons to get inside, where they are greeted by dozens of armed Eteon agents. Both of them are captured and strapped to electrical cables for interrogation. Brixton tries to get them to join Eteon, with each additional shock coming closer to killing them. Hattie sneaks up on Brixton and almost kills him, but the gun she's holding requires an identity reader. Hobbs and Shaw get free, fight off more goons, and destroy the facility after retrieving the extraction device. Unfortunately, Brixton snaps Andreiko's neck and gets away again, and the device gets wrecked. Hobbs then figures out somewhere to lay low.The three travel to Samoa, Hobbs's childhood home where his estranged family lives. He returns to his mother Sefina (Lori Pelenisa Tuisano) and brothers Jonah (Cliff Curtis), Mateo (Roman Reigns), Timo (Josh Mauga), and Kal (John Tui), plus his three cousins. Jonah is especially dismayed to see Hobbs after his long absence. However, Sefina knows how urgent it is that the brothers help Hobbs out. They go to arm themselves as they prepare for Brixton and Eteon's goons to arrive, but Sefina has gotten rid of all their weapons. The plan then becomes that the family will fight Eteon with their bare hands and wits. Jonah fixes the device to start getting it out of Hattie.Brixton and Eteon are tracked as they make their way to the island. The Hobbs men stand ready for battle. The Eteon goons try to shoot them, but Hattie has disabled their guns. Fists begin to fly, bodies are thrown, and bones are broken as the agents are demolished by the Samoans. Brixton grabs Hattie and starts to escape on a helicopter. Hobbs and Shaw ride together while Jonah and the others follow. They hook their vehicles together like a train as Hobbs throws a hook onto the helicopter to bring it down. The helicopter crashes down below. Hobbs and Shaw face off against Brixton while Hattie has all of the Snowflake removed from her, and she kills Brixton's goon. Realizing he is just going to intercept their every move, Hobbs and Shaw resolve to fight him by having one of them take a hit while the other delivers a hit. This proves effective, as it causes Brixton's programming to overload. After witnessing his defeat, the Eteon leader deprograms Brixton's enhancements, and he dies before falling over the edge of the cliff. The unseen Eteon leader then speaks to Hobbs and Shaw, implying that they will see the two of them again.Afterwards, Shaw and Hattie go visit their mother in prison and leave her a cake that may contain something that will allow her to escape. Meanwhile, Hobbs decides to bring Sam to meet his family, as he has decided to stick around this time.During the credits, Locke contacts Hobbs again as he is fighting with other Eteon agents over another, possibly even more deadly virus. Locke also managed to stab a guy with a brick. In another scene, Hobbs gets Shaw back for the Moscow fake name by having the police get him and address him as ""Hugh Janus"". Shaw steps out but doesn't look like he's going to go quietly."
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6146586/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"John Wick is on the run after killing a member of the international assassins' guild, and with a $14 million price tag on his head, he is the target of hit men and women everywhere. In this third installment of the adrenaline-fueled action franchise, skilled assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns with a $14 million price tag on his head and an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail. After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin's guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world's most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn. After gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy international assassin's guild -- legendary hit man John Wick finds himself stripped of the organization's protective services. Now stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the world's most ruthless killers.—pratham048 John Wick is on the run for two reasons, as he is being hunted for a global $14 million dollar open contract on his life, and for breaking a central rule: taking a life on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim was a member of the High Table who ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, except the Continental's manager, Winston, has given him a one-hour grace period before he's 'Excommunicado' - membership revoked, banned from all services and cut off from other members. John uses the service industry to stay alive as he fights and kills his way out of New York City.—Santhosh In the aftermath of the blood-spattered events inJohn Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), the legendary virtuoso of death now finds himself heavily outgunned in the dark underbelly of Manhattan's tangled urban battlefield. And with a tempting bounty placed on Wick's head and every ambitious nobody in the business itching to terminate him, the excommunicated cardinal of destruction is with his back to the wall. As a result, John has to confront pitilessly endless waves of the High Table's brutal assassins, and it's all because of a fatal mistake at the neutral Continental Hotel and a long-standing feud over an innocent puppy. Indeed, many have tried to claim John's head. However, dead men can't spend money. Now, the artist of suffering prepares for war. But what were they thinking? Don't they know who the Bogeyman is?—Nick Riganas Less than an hour after the conclusion of the previous film, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is now a marked man and on the run in Manhattan. After the unsanctioned killing of crime lord and new member of the High Table Santino D'Antonio in the New York City Continental, John is declared ""Ex-Communicado"" by his handlers at the High Table and placed under a $14 million bounty. On the run from assassins, John reaches the New York Public Library and recovers a crucifix necklace and a ""marker"" medallion from a secret cache in a book. He fights his way through numerous assassins populating New York City until he reaches the Director (Anjelica Huston), a woman from his past who operates a theater. She accepts the crucifix as a ""ticket"" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco and has Wick branded to signify that he has used up all his favors.Meanwhile, an Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) with the High Table meets with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the New York City Continental, and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a network of vagrant assassins. The Adjudicator admonishes both for helping John Wick kill Santino D'Antonio, and both are given seven days to give up their offices or face serious consequences.
In Casablanca, John meets Sofia (Halle Berry), a former friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. He presents his marker and asks Sofia to honor it by directing him to the Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), a high-ranking member of the High Table (the only person senior to the high table), so that he can ask to have his bounty waived. Sofia takes him to an assassin named Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who tells John that he may find the Elder by wandering through the desert until he cannot walk any longer. In exchange for this information, Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs; when Sofia refuses, he shoots the dog. In retaliation, Sofia shoots Berrada, and the duo fight their way out of the Kasbah and flee into the desert.Having fulfilled her marker, Sofia leaves John in the desert. He roams until he collapses from exhaustion but is found by the Elder's men. John explains his actions, saying he is desperate to live on to ""earn"" the memory of the love he once had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John but only if he assassinates Winston and continues to work for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to the Elder.
Meanwhile, the Adjudicator recruits the assassin Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his students to enforce the will of the High Table. With Zero's help, the Adjudicator accosts the Director and the Bowery King. As penance, both are maimed, the Bowery King almost fatally. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men. Zero nearly kills John before his pursuit is halted as they arrive at the New York City Continental, under threat of being declared Ex-Communicado. Zero reveals himself as a fan of John's, but John disregards his overtures. John meets with Winston, who encourages John not to die as a killer but as a man who loved and was loved by his wife.The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. As a consequence, the Adjudicator ""deconsecrates"" the New York City Continental, revoking its protected neutral ground status. The Adjudicator then notifies Zero and his men and sends two busloads of body-armored High Table enforcers as their support. With the help of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), John defends the Continental from the enforcers. At first, the armored enforcers easily kill most of the Continental's guards, but then John and Charon manage to kill the enforcers with armor-piercing shotgun shells. John is then ambushed by Zero and his students. John defeats and kills all but two of the students, then fatally wounds Zero.The Adjudicator negotiates a parley with Winston, who explains the rebellion as a ""show of strength"" and offers penance to the High Table. John arrives, and when the Adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, Winston shoots John repeatedly, causing John to fall off of the Continental's roof. The New York City Continental returns to operation and is ""reconsecrated"", but the Adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared and that he remains a threat for both of them. Meanwhile, a wounded John Wick is delivered to the heavily-scarred Bowery King, who tells John he is angry with the High Table and will be fighting against them. He asks John if he also feels pissed off, and John responds with ""yeah."""
Knives Out,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A detective investigates the death of the patriarch of an eccentric, combative family. When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's disfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.—Lionsgate Nothing could blemish the lavish birthday party at the palatial estate of acclaimed crime/mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey except for his strange and unaccountable death. Now, the sharp knife in the silver-haired deceased's hand is a dead giveaway that something, or someone, had been bothering Harlan. But cryptic detective Benoit Blanc is not entirely sure. Because, as it turns out, there are more than a few members of the successful author's clingy family who have been economical with the truth so far. And as Blanc struggles to shed light on a tangled mess of half-baked leads and little white lies, all eyes are on the grand prize: Harlan's magnificent legacy. The question is, can Benoit find the answer to this perplexing case before someone else dies?—Nick Riganas The morning after his eighty-fifth birthday party held at his Norfolk County mansion with his dysfunctional family of his mother, his surviving children, their spouses, and their children in attendance, successful novelist and publishing house owner Harlan Thrombey, self-made in his wealth, is discovered in his attic study by Fran, one of the housekeepers, him dead with his throat slashed, knife in hand. Arguably the last person to see him alive was his Brazilian nurse, Marta Cabrera, the daughter of an illegal immigrant, something she has told few within this sphere. She went through her evening ritual of playing a game of Go with him and administering his medication at that time. A week later following the funeral, the local police are questioning the family members at the mansion to see what happened that night that could have led to his death, the questioning in their belief that Harlan committed suicide. The interviewees all confirm the time-line of events supporting that suicide belief. One other person at each of the interviews is famed private detective Benoit Blanc, who the family will learn has been retained as a consultant. What he fails to tell them in return is that he was hired anonymously, cash in advance. Blanc is able to bait many of the interviewees into bad mouthing other family members while being reticent to admit something that Blanc already seems to know about them, each of the family members looking out solely for him/herself. The key interview, one that happens unexpectedly, may be with Marta, who Blanc suspects was Harlan's confidante and who cannot lie in always having the physical reaction of vomiting whenever she does. One person not interviewed in being absent is one of Harlan's grandchildren, overly privileged Ransom Drysdale, who left the party early after having had a private conversation with his grandfather, he not being interviewed somewhat immaterial as Ransom was known to have not been at the mansion at the time of death. The nature of the investigation changes a week later at the reading of the will, where all will discover but some who were already aware that Harlan had rewritten it the week before his death, the specific changes not known until this day. With all these comings and goings, learning the full truth of what happened with Harlan may come down to discovering the unknown of who hired Blanc and why.—Huggo Wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his extended family to his remote mansion on his 85th birthday in order to deliver important, though disappointing, news to a number of family members. The next morning, however, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead in his study.The police, along with experienced private eye Benoit Blanc, are called in to investigate. Throughout a series of interviews with members of the family, secrets are revealed as well as possible motives for murder. Richard, Harlan's son-in-law, was discovered to have cheated on his wife Linda, Harlan's daughter, with Harlan threatening to expose him. Joni, Harlan's daughter-in-law and wife of his deceased son Neil, was exposed by Harlan after she stole $400,000 from him by sourcing duplicate checks meant for her daughter, Megan, to a private bank account. Walter, Harlan's youngest son, was fired from his father's publishing company during the birthday party. Ransom, Linda and Richard's son, had discovered he'd been cut out of the will entirely.It is then revealed that after the party, Harlan's caretaker, Marta Cabrera, took Harlan upstairs to give him his nightly medication. After beginning to play a game of Go, Harlan jokingly knocked the board off of the table before Marta could give him his medication. Marta picked up the bottles and injected him, but realized that she accidentally gave him 100 milligrams of morphine. To protect his friend, Harlan gave her strict instructions on how to escape and avoid suspicion before slitting his own throat, leaving Marta shocked. Marta then drove away, parked her car, and returned to the house through the gate entrance, before climbing up the trellis on the side of the house and wearing Harlan's coat and hat to confuse Walter in his peripheral vision, who had seen Marta leave, ruling her out as a suspect. The police question Marta, as she is a trustworthy source due to her inability to lie without vomiting, but she makes it through her interrogation without fail. Suspecting foul play, Blanc is determined to find the true cause of death.The next day, Blanc, along with Marta and the police, search the house and its surroundings for clues, many of which Marta is able to cover up before the detectives can find them. Since it is the day of Harlan's will reading, the family anxiously awaits the reveal, and are shocked to hear that Harlan left everything to Marta, including his inheritance, the house, and his company. Despite the family's kindness to Marta the night prior, they quickly turn on her but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom and Marta then go to a local restaurant where Ransom coaxes Marta into telling him everything.Meanwhile, the family members realize that if Marta can be proven as the murderer, they will regain their inheritance. They insist that the murder investigation continue, and Blanc confirms his suspicion of foul play, adding that everyone is still a potential suspect. This leads to Marta receiving a ransom note reading ""I know what you did"" along with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report.Marta drives with Ransom to the medical examiner's office, only to find it up in flames and swarming with police. At Ransom's insistence, Marta checks her email, and finds an address and time. Blanc spots the pair before they engage in a car chase, but Marta and Ransom are ultimately unable to evade their pursuers before Ransom is arrested after Wanetta, Harlan's mother and elderly matriarch of the family, falsely identified Marta as him at the house. Marta drives to the address only to find Fran there, drugged. Marta performs CPR on her, and calls the police phone line, ensuring that Fran gets to the hospital safely. On the drive back to the mansion, Marta reveals everything to Blanc, who discourages her from confessing to the family. However, Blanc tells her to stop at the last minute when he spots something in a copy of the full toxicology report that Fran had hidden away.The police bring Ransom to the house and place him in a private room where Blanc and Marta are waiting. Blanc reveals that he deduced the murder and goes on to reveal what he knows. The night of the party, Ransom stormed out after discovering Marta's inheritance from Harlan and decided to frame her for his murder. Ransom swapped the contents of the medication vials and removed the emergency morphine counter agent, ensuring the morphine overdose. Ransom then swapped the vials back while the rest of the family was at Harlan's funeral. Fran saw Ransom in Harlan's study that day and deduced his involvement in Harlan's death, prompting her to send him the ransom letter, which Ransom then sent to Marta after cutting out the address. Ransom then burnt down the medical examiner's office to ensure that Harlan's blood work was destroyed. Ransom confronted Fran and drugged her with morphine, nearly killing her before destroying the original copy of the toxicology report and emailing Marta Fran's location in the hopes of fooling the police into believing Marta had murdered Fran. Blanc then reveals that the toxicology report shows that Harlan wasn't poisoned at all, and that Marta had instinctively given Harlan the correct medication, but, noticing the mislabeling, didn't know.Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive, forcing Ransom to admit his crimes before angrily vowing revenge and legal recourse on Marta. At the last moment, Marta vomits on Ransom, revealing that she had lied and that Fran actually died at the hospital. Enraged that he had been tricked into admitting murder and arson, Ransom attempts to stab Marta but the knife turns out to be one of Harlan's many props. He is then taken into police custody while the rest of the family watches in disgust. As Ransom is taken away, the remaining Thrombey family look up to the mansion's balcony to see Marta sipping from Harlan's signature coffee cup with the label ""My House, My Rules, My Coffee"" written on it."

Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) and Toothless infiltrate it to rescue captured dragons, with Hiccup wearing a suit of dragon scales to walk through fire. They are joined by Astrid (voice of America Ferrera), Snotlout (voice of Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (voice of Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut (voice of Kristen Wiig) and Tuffnut (voice of Justin Rupple), all wearing scale suits and riding in on their dragons to fight the trappers. The heroes free the dragons and escape, unaware that they have left one behind.The Dragon Riders return to Berk, which is now wildly overpopulated with dragons that they have rescued over the last year, with one new dragon knocking over a whole row of dragon towers. Hiccup has been leading the villagers as chief, but he still doesn't feel that he is the chief his father was. Meanwhile, Valka (voice of Cate Blanchett) has been helping train other dragons. Gobber (voice of Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup and Astrid should get married soon, but neither of them feel they are ready in their relationship to take that step.A notorious dragon slayer called Grimmel the Grisly (voice of F. Murray Abraham) arrives to meet with the warlords that have been capturing dragons. When they tell Grimmel about Hiccup and Toothless, he finds himself surprised, as he had believed to have slayed every last Night Fury. The warlords show Grimmel the dragon that was left behind, a white Night Fury (""Light Fury"" as it will later be known). He decides to use her as bait to lure Toothless to him, and he doesn't worry about Hiccup since Grimmel sees him as just a boy in over his head.We see a flashback of a young Hiccup with Stoick (voice of Gerard Butler), who tells his son about the legend of a hidden world of dragons. He had hoped to find it so that he can end the fighting between vikings and dragons.Toothless goes out alone at night and comes across the Light Fury. He becomes enamored by her and starts making an attempt to woo her. Hiccup and Astrid come across them, but they startle her and she fires a blast in their direction before she vanishes into thin air.Toothless falls in love with the Light Fury, which Hiccup can see. He takes Toothless and Tuffnut (who wants to give Hiccup relationship advice) back into the woods to look for her, but Hiccup manages to detect one of Grimmel's traps before it catches Toothless. He brings back a tranquilizer dart they found, which Eret (voice of Kit Harington) recognizes as Grimmel's work. He warns Hiccup that Grimmel most likely wanted them to find that trap as a means to lead him right back to them.That night, Hiccup finds Grimmel has snuck inside his house and seemingly tranquilized Toothless. He orders Hiccup to give Toothless up and expresses how he thinks humans and dragons shouldn't co-exist since he views humans as being superior. When he goes to Toothless, it turns out that he shot Fishlegs, and Hiccup's friends and family come out to ambush Grimmel. However, he summons his acid-spitting Deathgrippers to tear through Hiccup's home. He gathers the Berkians together and realizes that with Grimmel going after them, it is no longer safe to stay in that land. While some of the villagers argue against leaving their homes, Hiccup tells them that they are Berk no matter where they live. However, Grimmel was counting on them to abandon their homes all along, and he plans to keep tracking Toothless with reluctant help from the warlords. all while making more of the venom to tranquilize dragons.The Berkians travel with the dragons to another island to stay temporarily. The Light Fury appears to follow the group, but she vanishes after knocking Hiccup off of Toothless's back after mistaking him for an enemy. She reappears later that night, and Toothless goes after her. Hiccup wakes up and goes to try and help him out. Toothless does goofy dances to court the Light Fury, which does not impress her. He then manages to draw her face in the sand, which she seems to like. Unfortunately, she flies away again when she spots Hiccup, and Toothless is unable to fly after her because of his bad fin. Hiccup later decides to fix up the fin and paint it black so that Toothless can go and find the Light Fury.Valka heads back out on Cloudjumper to make sure the villagers weren't followed. They are spotted by the Deathgrippers, who try to attack and bring them down, but the two manage to escape and head back to warn Hiccup.Toothless flies until he finds the Light Fury.

He sends the Deathgrippers after them, but they manage to evade them and escape. They accidentally leave Ruffnut behind and don't realize it until they return to the island. Hiccup is then pressured into finding another solution to stopping Grimmel. He notices Toothless hasn't returned, and Astrid reminds him that he gave Toothless his freedom to be with the Light Fury.As Grimmel tries to make his next move, Ruffnut starts to annoy the hell out of him with her endless talking, so he frees her. Ruffnut inadvertently blabs about their new location, so he keeps a close eye on her to see where she's headed.Hiccup and Astrid ride Stormfly to find Toothless. They come across the waterfall and are flown down into the hidden dragon world, which is vast and beautiful. They see Hiccup acting as the alpha to all the dragons (you can even see Drago's Bewilderbeest among them), with the Light Fury now officially being his mate. The other dragons spot Hiccup and Astrid and chase after them. Toothless and Stormfly grab them and flee. Hiccup starts to figure that the Berkians couldn't live with the dragons in their world and that maybe that's where the dragons ought to be.Ruffnut returns to the village, and Grimmel has followed her back. He and his men, plus the Deathgrippers, start to attack again, this time ending with Grimmel successfully capturing Toothless and the Light Fury. The other dragons are forced to follow Grimmel since he has their alpha, and he threatens to kill the Light Fury if Hiccup follows. Hiccup feels hopeless and sees himself as a failure as chief. Astrid encourages him as she always has, letting him know she was the first person to believe in him and will always be there to pick him up. Hiccup rounds up his friends with their dragon suits to fly after the ship.Grimmel brings his captured dragons to the warlords, but he tells them that he plans to kill Toothless for himself, denying them the chance to have him for themselves. The heroes then swoop in to free their dragons and take on Grimmel's army. They manage to steer the dragon trapper ships toward each other, causing the trappers to abandon ship as they all sink. Grimmel attempts to kill Hiccup, but he manages to free Toothless. Grimmel takes the Light Fury to the sky, leading Hiccup and Toothless to chase after them. The Deathgrippers fly in and surround Toothless, until he harnesses his lightning power and electrocutes them all before vanishing. He appears before Grimmel, and Hiccup jumps toward him. Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless, sending him falling to the ground. Hiccup tackles the villain and frees the Light Fury, order her to save Toothless as Hiccup and Grimmel fall. The Light Fury catches Toothless and lands with him on a cliff. Grimmel tears Hiccup's suit apart, but the Light Fury flies toward Hiccup. He loosens his prosthetic foot, sending Grimmel to his watery grave as the Light Fury catches Hiccup.The Berkians celebrate their victory until Hiccup realizes it is time to let Toothless go. He bids his best friend farewell, and the two embrace tearfully. The other Berkians must then say goodbye to their beloved dragons. They fly toward the hidden world, with Toothless sharing one last look with Hiccup.A while later, Hiccup and Astrid get married, making them chief and chieftess. We then cut to years later where Hiccup and Astrid now have a son and a daughter. They ride a boat toward the hidden world and come across Toothless and the Light Fury sitting together on a rock with three little dragons of their own. Toothless flies over to the boat and does not seem to immediately recognize Hiccup. He slowly moves his hand toward his snout as he did when they first met, and Toothless pounces on Hiccup for the first time in perhaps a decade. Astrid then brings the kids over so that Hiccup can introduce them to Toothless. They then take flight on Toothless, Stormfly, and the Light Fury together as a family. Hiccup says that although people now believe that the dragons are gone for good, the Berkians know the truth and will continue to protect their secret until the day dragons can come back out in peace."

Blake and Schofield's stories as it pertains to them as soldiers in the bigger picture of the war, as soldiers trying to stay alive, as friends, and as human beings who have their own motivations are told for as long as they are able to survive on this mission.—Huggo It's been already three devastating years into the costly World War I, and the Imperial German Army seems to have retreated from their position in the battle-scarred Western Front--an elaborate scheme designed to lure the Allies into a deadly trap. On April 6, 1917--with the lives of 1,600 fellow soldiers hanging by a thread--the best friends and British Army Lance Corporals, Tom Blake and Will Schofield, undertake a peril-laden mission to hand-deliver an urgent, life-saving message to Colonel MacKenzie's Second Battalion of the Devonshire line infantry regiment. With this in mind, amid the horrors of an uncannily silent no man's land, the young brothers-in-arms must traverse nine long miles of hostile enemy terrain in the French countryside, to reach the 2nd Devons in time and call off the imminent attack. Now, two ordinary troopers walk into certain death. What makes a true hero?—Nick Riganas British trenches somewhere in France. World War One has been going on for the third year, heroic illusions have dissipated; general mood - boredom and fatigue. Stuff the belly, sleep, return home to Christmas Eve. On another quiet day, when nothing happens, two young soldiers, Blake and Schofield, are summoned to the general, who instructs them to send an important message to Colonel MacKenzie in the Second Devonshire Battalion, whose telephone connection was cut off by the enemy.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) On 6 April 1917, aerial reconnaissance has observed that the German army, which has pulled back from a sector of the Western Front in northern France, is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new Hindenburg Line, where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with artillery. In the British trenches, with field telephone lines cut, two young British soldiers, Lance Corporals William Schofield, a veteran of the Somme, and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother Lieutenant Joseph Blake.Schofield and Blake cross no man's land to reach the abandoned German trenches. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where they witness a German plane being shot down. Schofield and Blake drag the burned pilot from the plane. However, the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Schofield is then picked up by a passing British unit.A destroyed canal bridge near Écoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing. Schofield chooses to part with them at the bridge, but before he does, one of the unit's officers Captain Smith, warns Schofield that Colonel Mackenzie is someone who would rather fight than follow orders. He then uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and quickly comes under fire from a German sniper. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked unconscious. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He is discovered by German soldiers, who open fire. Schofield escapes the soldiers by hiding in the basement of an abandoned building, and stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he comforts the infant by reciting a poem, giving the woman his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite her pleas, Schofield leaves soon after, realising that time is not on his side. He encounters more German soldiers, strangling one and pushing past another who is inebriated. Being chased, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank by morning. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.Realising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Mackenzie says that, while the cancellation offers a temporary reprieve, command will likely change its orders in a week. Schofield is told that Joseph was in the first wave, and he searches for him among the wounded, finding him unscathed. Joseph is upset to hear of his brother's death, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield gives Joseph his brother's rings and dog tag, and asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters."

His best friend is Cliff Booth, an aging stuntman who was Dalton's stunt-double in movies and TV. His career is largely over. While Booth ekes out an existence, Dalton still lives a life of relative luxury in Hollywood, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. In fact, his neighbours areRoman PolanskiandSharon Tate.—grantss Set in Los Angeles, 1969. Over the hill TV actor, Rick Dalton, and his best friend and stunt-double, Cliff Booth, strive to reignite their careers as their failure is juxtaposed with the success of Rick's new next door neighbours:Sharon TateTate andRoman PolanskiRick and Cliff become unwittingly entangled with the infamous Manson family in the process.—jmcrighton-892-694446 After a meteoric five-year rise to the top in the cut-throat world of dazzling Hollywood and a long decade of treading water, the once-young-and-popular action star, Rick Dalton, finds it difficult to swallow that the rapacious and always hungry for new blood film industry can do without him. Sensing that his career may be nearing its end, Rick along with his sympathetic confidant and former stunt double, Cliff Booth, face the grim possibility of a mundane new life in an ever-changing 1969 Los Angeles. Now, unlike his glamorous next-door neighbours--the young director fresh off the triumphant success ofRosemary's Baby (1968),Roman Polanski, and the rising star ofThe Wrecking Crew (1968),Sharon Tate--Rick has to make a difficult decision. Of course, none of them is aware that their fates, and their very lives, are on a collision course with a certainCharles Manson, and his army of ferociously zealous believers. Will Hollywood ever be the same after August 9, 1969?—Nick Riganas The film opens with a clip from an old Western TV series, ""Bounty Law."" It features action star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the lead role as Jake Cahill, a renegade bounty hunter. Following the clip is an interview with Rick and his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), both of whom describe Cliff's role as essentially carrying Rick's load.Saturday, February 8th, 1969Rick and Cliff are in a restaurant where Rick is met by producer Marvin Schwarz (Al Pacino). He is a fan of Rick's work, having seen a double feature presentation of his where he plays an action star, including one where he is a GI that incinerates Nazis with a flamethrower (which he kept). Marvin also brings up a cheesy music video Rick was featured in. ""Bounty Law"" has since been canceled because of Rick's ongoing alcoholism (which is also why Cliff is his driver), and now Rick has booked a gig as a villain on the series ""Lancer."" Marvin thinks Rick ought to fly to Rome and shoot Spaghetti Westerns. Rick complains to Cliff about how this means that his career is going downhill, and he is now a has-been.Cliff drives Rick home, where they learn that Rick's new neighbors are director Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and his wife, rising starlet Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Rick's mood turns around since he thinks that a big-time director like Polanski (hot off directing the recent thriller ""Rosemary's Baby"") can help reinvigorate his career. He goes to rehearse his lines for ""Lancer"" for the night. Cliff then drives home to his trailer, where he lives alone with his dog Brandy.Polanski brings Sharon to a party at the Playboy Mansion, where they meet with their friends Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch), Steve McQueen (Damien Lewis), and Michelle Phillips (Rebecca Rittenhouse). Sharon goes dancing, while McQueen talks to Connie Stevens (Dreama Walker). He notes that Sharon is using Polanski to make Jay jealous, and Connie thinks that Sharon has a type - short men that ""look like 12-year-old boys"".Sunday, February 9th, 1969After Polanski leaves, Sharon hangs out with Jay at her house. Visiting them is Charles Manson (Damon Herriman), claiming that he is coming to see his friends, the previous owners of the house that Polanski and Sharon now live in. He apologizes for the error and leaves.Cliff brings Rick to the set of ""Lancer"" for the day's shoot. He goes back to Rick's house after he asks Cliff to fix the antenna on his roof. He happens to spot Manson as he leaves, and he smiles and waves at Cliff. We then see a flashback to Rick talking to an old friend of his, Randy (Kurt Russell), into getting Cliff a gig. Randy shows reluctance since it is rumored that Cliff murdered his wife Billie (Rebecca Gayheart) and got away with it. The alleged incident is shown on a boat where Billie was nagging Cliff endlessly, but it cuts away before we see if Cliff really did shoot Billie with the harpoon gun he was holding. Randy brings Cliff to the set, where he meets Bruce Lee (Mike Moh), talking about wanting to fight boxer Muhammad Ali. When Lee catches Cliff laughing at what he's saying, he challenges him to a fight to see who knocks who on the ground first. Lee gets Cliff down first, and he retaliates by grabbing Lee and slamming him into a car. The two then go hand-to-hand until Janet (Zoe Bell), Randy's wife and fellow stunt coordinator comes in and is pissed to see Cliff and Lee fighting, and the huge dent that Cliff left in there, meaning he's fired.In the present, Sharon drives through Hollywood, where she goes to a local bookstore, and then goes to the local movie theater and sees that a film she is featured in, ""The Wrecking Crew,"" is playing. She goes to the box office and asks for a ticket, but then asks if she gets any privilege for starring in the film. The manager comes out and recognizes Sharon from ""Valley of the Dolls,"" and he invites her in. Throughout the film, Sharon listens to the audience's enthusiastic reactions to her performance, with laughter and cheering at the right moments.Meanwhile, Rick goes through his hair and make-up for ""Lancer."" He then sits down next to his eight-year-old co-star Trudi (Julia Butters), who is a method actor. Rick smokes a cigarette near her as she reads her book. They have a conversation about the books they are reading, and Rick has a small breakdown over his perceived decline in stardom. Shooting begins, and Rick works with the series lead actor, James Stacey (Timothy Olyphant), who plays protagonist Johnny Madrid. During the take, Rick forgets his lines due to being drunk. He goes to his trailer and has a meltdown, but then vows to do better.Elsewhere, Cliff drives home from Rick's place and sees a hitchhiker called Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), whom Cliff has noticed throughout the weekend. He picks her up and agrees to take her to the Spahn Ranch, where Cliff used to shoot films with Rick. When they get there, Cliff sees that the place has become some kind of commune for hippies, mostly consisting of women. Pussycat tells Cliff that he should stick around to meet Manson, but he wants to speak with the ranch's elderly owner, George Spahn (Bruce Dern). The women warn Cliff that Spahn is sleeping, but he goes over to his house anyway. He is met by Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme (Dakota Fanning), who also reiterates that Spahn is asleep because she just had sex with him. Cliff goes to wake Spahn up, but he doesn't recognize Cliff since he is blind. He asks Spahn if the women there are taking advantage of him, but Spahn denies it and tells Cliff to leave. Outside, Cliff sees one of the male hippie's stuck a knife in his front tire. He gets his stuff out and orders the man to fix it, but is given a ""fuck you."" Cliff responds by decking the guy hard in the face three times in front of the other women. One of the Manson girls gets a horse and runs to get Tex Watson (Austin Butler), but Cliff is already driving away by the time he arrives.Back on the ""Lancer"" set, Rick shoots a scene where he has Trudi's character hostage, and Scott Lancer, played by Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry), comes to intervene. Rick improvises his slimy villain character and has a moment where he throws Trudi off of him. After the take, he is praised by both the director and Trudi, who tells Rick that it was the best acting she has ever seen in her life. The comment even moves Rick to tears.Cliff and Rick go back to the latter's house to watch the episode of FBI her appears in. As they are watching, we cross cut to Schwaz, who makes a phone call regarding Ricks' career. The screen fades to black.Six months later.A voice-over from Randy states that Rick and Cliff ended up flying to Rome to shoot the Spaghetti Western films. While there, Rick met and married Italian film actress Francesca Capucci (Lorenza Izzo).August 8th, 1969Rick and Cliff have returned to Los Angeles, but now feel that it is time for them to go their separate ways. They spend one last night having drinks and hang out at Rick's home with Francesca. Meanwhile, Sharon, now very pregnant, is having a small gathering with Jay and their friends Wojciech Frykowski (Costa Ronin) and Abigail Folger (Samantha Robinson).Cliff takes out a cigarette he bought from Pussycat that was dipped in acid, and he proceeds to smoke it to trip out. Outside, Tex drives in front of the houses with fellow ""family"" members Patricia Krenwinkel, AKA Katie (Madisen Beaty), Susan Atkins, AKA Sadie (Mikey Madison), and Linda Kasabian, AKA Flowerchild (Maya Hawke). They arrive intending to kill Sharon and her friends, but a drunk Rick comes out and angrily yells at them because their car's busted muffler is making too much noise. He orders them to leave, even as Katie appears to be reaching for her gun, but Tex drives away. At the bottom of the hill, the four recognize Rick from TV, and Sadie suggests that they kill him and whoever else is in his house. The others agree, but as they start walking there, Flowerchild says she forgot her knife. Tex gives her the car keys to get it, but she ends up ditching them and driving away. The three then proceed to carry out their plan.The Manson trio walks up to Rick's house. Tex and Katie break in through the front door, while Sadie goes in through the side. Cliff sees them, but because he is tripping, he is neither frightened nor absolutely sure of what he is seeing. Even as Tex draws his gun on Cliff, he instead sics Brandy on Tex, who viciously chomps into Tex's arm and groin. Sadie tries to run up to Cliff with her knife, but he chucks a can of dog food at her, which smashes into her face. Cliff stomps Tex's face in until he is dead before grabbing Katie and brutally smashing her face against the hard furniture until she is dead too. Brandy gets a few bites into Sadie as well, but she runs out the back glass door, flailing and shrieking into the pool, where Rick is lounging. He then comes out with his flamethrower and torches Sadie, who burns to death in his pool. In the chaos, Cliff gets stabbed in his right hip by Katie, but non-fatally.Paramedics and police arrive at the scene. Cliff is taken to the hospital for his injuries, while Francesca is freaked out by the ordeal. After Rick says bye to Cliff, he sees Jay calling to him from Sharon's gate. Rick explains what happened, and Jay recognizes Rick from TV. Jay tells Sharon who her neighbor is, and they invite him to come over for a drink. Rick agrees, and he finally meets Sharon and her friends."

The wizard vowed to search for someone who possessed a pure of heart, leading him to search for millennia. He chooses Billy, who has to say the word Shazam. Billy says the word, and transforms into the champion Shazam, and the wizard disappears. Shazam returns to Philadelphia and returns to the foster home and meets with Freddie.

Happy, they walk through a mall where they use the lightning ability to charge people's cell phones, get sodas for free, attempt to purchase a lair from a real estate agent, and going to a strip club. He comes out and says we need more money. They go to an ATM, zapping it and taking some of the money, using it to purchase merchandise.Next day at school - the bullies begin to mess with Freddie and Billy again until Freddie tells them he knows the new hero ""Red Cyclone"" - they don't believe him but he promises and tells them that he'll get him to show up to lunch tomorrow. Freddie and Billy get into a bit of an argument over him just assuming and trying to use Billy for his powers. That night at dinner the father asks the family what they think of the new hero - everyone gives input and Freddie takes a dig at Shazam and then him and Billy get into a bit of an argument leaving the rest of the family confused.At school the next day, Billy decides not to attend school because he wants to find his mother, despite Freddie asking for lunch. Shazam does various things, taking selfies, and showing off lightning for money. He sees and saves Mary from being hit by a car, and talking to her makes him realize she is upset that, because of college, she will have to leave her family. Shazam accidentally reveals he knew her name and housing situation, but leaves. Freddie finds Shazam and tries to talk to him, yet Shazam tries to diffuse it, shooting lighting that hits the tires of a bus across the city, sending it off the side of the bridge. Catching it, Shazam puts it on the concrete, only to be promptly told he's not using his powers right. Hearing the commotion, Dr. Sivana shows up and demands the powers that Shazam possesses. Brushing him off, Shazam is promptly thrown around and lands through a mall, while discovering his ability to fly. Sivana hunts him down, but Shazam transforms back into Billy and runs. Freddie is there and is taken hostage by Sivana, who demands to be taken to Billy.Billy shows up, and they know with Eugene telling him where his mother is; she is only 2 subway stops away. Billy rushes out of his house, with his foster parents in tow. Back at the house, Sivana shows up with Freddie and traps the children. Billy arrives at his mother's apartment complex. His mother informs Billy he was intentionally abandoned on that day, and saw him with the police and that he would be better cared for by others since she was 17. Controlling his emotions in the face of the heartbreaking reality that his stubborn years-long search for his mother was for nothing, Billy quietly reassures his mother that he is fine, but he has to return to his real family. However, Billy gives his mother the key-chain compass she gave him years ago with a comment mixed with regret, resentment and understanding about her, ""You might need it more than me."" Leaving, he receives a call and Sivana tells him to come home. Billy jumps off the apartment building and transforms to Shazam and flies home.Shazam decides to give up the power to save his family and Sivana opens a magical door to the Rock of Eternity. Taking the wizard's staff, Sivana unleashes the 7 deadly sins. The siblings enter the cave and distract Sivana long enough for them to run and exit into a winter carnival.Sivana and the sins attack the Carnival, shooting at a Ferris wheel, almost tipping over. Sivana and Shazam fight all around the carnival. Getting a hold of the wizard's stick, Shazam and his family, yell his name, and transmits his power to his family, transforming them into the Shazam family, each an adult superhero. Each fighting one sin, Shazam engages with Sivana while flying through skyscrapers.As it goes to tip over - Freddie flies in and saves the last two people on it - the bullies. Shazam and Sivana end up on a rooftop and Shazam goads the one deadly sin who remained -- Envy. It rips itself out from Sivana's eye and Shazam yells Shazam, hurting it. Sivana is knocked off the roof, now mortal. Shazam grabs Sivana and drags him to the carnival, ripping the magical eye out. Saving the day, the Shazam family basks in the cheers of the crowd, takes the eye back to the lair, and return the sins for keeping. Shazam and Freddie decide this is their lair. Back at the foster home, everyone returned to their original form and are watching a news cast of the carnival instance, with Santa Claus describing the event. The foster family all talk and laugh and Billy finally feels happy and safe accepting a family.At school, Freddie sits down at lunch and the entire table leaves so all his siblings come and sit next to him. The bullies show up and ask if he's still friends with Red Cyclone - Shazam shows up and tells the school how Freddie showed him everything it means to be a hero and that he also brought another friend - Superman. In the mid-credits scene, Sivana in a prison cell doodling the symbols all over the wall in a futile effort to reopen the portal until he's interrupted by the alien caterpillar, Mister Mind, who tells him of the pillars of evil that will come together.In the post credits scene, Shazam tries to talk to fish a la Aquaman."
Ford v Ferrari,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1950186/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"American car designerCarroll Shelbyand driverKen Milesbattle corporate interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. AsEnzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars dominate the mid-1960s motorsport world, the American car designer,Carroll Shelby, is forced to retire after winning the demanding 1959 '24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race. But, before long, an unexpected proposition by the Vice President ofHenry Ford's motor company,Lee Iacocca, will offer an opportunity to beat the Italians at their own game. Now, under those pressing circumstances, the British sports car driver and racing engineer,Ken Miles, reluctantly agrees to lend a hand and improve the firm's image, as Ford's race team has less than ninety days to rewrite history. As a result, the non-conformist duo comes up with the mighty Ford GT40 Mk I high-performance racing car. Can Shelby and Miles break Ferrari's streak?—Nick Riganas American automotive designerCarroll Shelbyand British race car driverKen Milescompete in a fierce corporate battle as well as nature itself, to build a vehicle for the Ford automobiles. Together, they plan to compete against the race cars ofEnzo Ferrariat the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.—Jwelch5742 Ford Company has a big problem in selling its cars in the 1960s. They decide to take part in 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race to show and advertise their cars. Ferrari's fast racing cars dominate the mid-60s racing world. Ford's advertisement team request Carrol Shelby to build fast cars for the race. Shelby asks British driver and racing engineer, Ken Miles to be the main driver for Ford's company in the race. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is a professional racer who is forced into early retirement due to a heart condition and goes into car sales. Warm and likable, he's a natural salesman and a people person. He is also an incredible vehicle designer and engineer. Meanwhile, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is a racer currently working as a mechanic and running his own shop to support his wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe). He tells it like it is and sometimes gets customers angry, but he doesn't sugarcoat anything. At a race, Ken is told his car does not meet regulations and begins angrily yelling at the race official - Carroll spots this and calms him down, but afterward, the two get into an argument, and Ken throws a wrench at him. Later, the IRS comes and shuts down Ken's garage, and he's forced to give up most of his racing in order to take care of his family.Meanwhile, at Ford Motors, Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is furious that sales are down and that his father's company is in danger. He begins taking pitches from his underlings - Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) pitches him an idea - the sexiest cars are race cars, like Ferraris. He posits that if Ford can win the Le Mans, the 24-hour race, they will be at the top. In order to do that, they fly to Italy in order to offer the struggling Ferrari a deal - they will buy the company and let Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) maintain control of the racing division. Ferrari uses this offer to get Fiat to make a good offer, and they buy Ferrari. Ferrari tells the Ford businessmen to shove it and calls Henry a fat pig. When they get back, Henry makes them relay in detail what Ferrari said, and he becomes more determined than ever to beat Ferrari. He decides they will start their own racing division.Lee approaches Carroll, as the only American to ever win at Le Mans, if he would be the head of their racing team, designing and testing the cars. Carroll agrees - and goes to Ken, the best driver he knows, to take part. When Mollie sees Ken heading out with Carroll, she angrily demands to know the truth. He tells her that he's been offered great pay to race, and she's thrilled - she just doesn't want him to ever lie to her. The team begins getting the car into shape for their first big race, but as it approaches, Ford vice president Leo Bebee (Josh Lucas), approaches Carroll and tells them that Ken's rakish, unpredictable quality is not part of the Ford brand and he can't be trusted to do press and represent Ford well and that he can't be their driver. Carroll fights for Ken, but is eventually forced to tell Ken that he won't be racing - Ken is furious. When Ford loses the race, Carroll is able to convince Henry to allow him to rehire Ken. He goes to Ken's house and apologizes and asks him to come back, and the two end up getting into a physical fight on his front lawn. They finally give up, exhausted, and Mollie brings them some cold sodas.Ken rejoins the team, who are working day and night trying to perfect the car. Lee warns Carroll that Leo is determined to have Ken removed from the team, and intend on doing so on their next visit. Knowing this, when Henry and Leo arrive, Carroll locks Leo in his office and takes Henry out for a ride in the race car, and Henry experiences just how terrifying and exhilarating racing is. When they stop, he breaks down into sobs. Carroll offers him a deal - let Ken race at Daytona - if they win, he races at Le Mans in France. If they lose, Henry gets full control over Carroll's company. At Daytona, they find tough competition in a second Ford team that Ford had commissioned to see who engineered the best vehicle. Ken is able to win the race, securing their team the spot at Le Mans and ensuring Ken will drive there.In France, Le Mans approaches. Ferrari and Henry are both in attendance. When the race starts, Ken's door won't shut, slowing him down on the first lap. The car that they had designed was able to accelerate to really high speeds, but doing so burned out the brakes, so deep into the race, the pit crew changes out the brakes. The Italians at Ferrari are furious, saying this is a violation of the rules, but Carroll points out the rule-book says they are allowed to change parts, and it isn't specified which ones. Eventually, Ferrari's car spins out and crashes, leaving Ken in first place, and Mollie and Peter are able to watch on TV as Ken completes his much-desired ""perfect"" leg. Leo, who had been trying to bypass Carroll and mess with their strategy, goes to Henry and suggests that the best image for Ford would be to have all three of their cars cross the finish together. He agrees, and Leo gives Carroll the order, who refuses. Carroll tells Ken the instruction but tells him it's his race, and he will stand behind him no matter what. At first, Ken speeds to the victory, but he eventually relents and slows down, allowing the other drivers to catch up and cross the finish together. Everyone celebrates Ken's win until a technicality - he started behind another car - puts him into second, not first. Carroll is furious, but Ken accepts it, and the two go off together.Weeks later, while testing a new car design, the J-Car, Ken, who is not wearing safety gear while driving it, crashes and is killed. Carroll goes to his family's home and finds Peter, whom he gives the wrench that Ken threw at him. He gets into his car, and despite his condition, speeds off into the distance. The post-script tells us that Carroll's cars won the Le Mans four years and that Ken was inducted posthumously into the racing hall of fame."

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4777008/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Maleficent and her goddaughter Aurora begin to question the complex family ties that bind them as they are pulled in different directions by impending nuptials, unexpected allies, and dark new forces at play. Five peaceful years have passed since the demise of the duplicitous monarch King Stefan inMaleficent (2014), and now, an unforeseen but joyous event is about to unite the mortal kingdom of Ulstead and the fairy-realm of the enchanted Moors. However, once more, odious treason stands in the way of true young love, as malicious envy, unbounded ambition and ignoble thoughts creep in the hearts of men. Now, two neighboring worlds find themselves divided by fear and prejudice, and, sadly, the impending union paves the way for an all-out confrontation. Suddenly, magnificent winged sprite Maleficent and lovely Princess Aurora are caught in the middle. Does love always end well?—Nick Riganas This sequel to the first Malificent film opens in the Moors. Three men approach a tree where little mushroom fairies are hiding. The man grabs for them, and he manages to get a few. They are stopped and attacked by a creature with large horns. Two of the men are killed by this creature while one escapes with one of the little mushroom fairies. He returns it to the kingdom of Ulstead for an unknown purpose.The narrator states that it has been five years since Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) became guardian to Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) after rescuing her from her father, King Stefan, but the story about Maleficent has been twisted to continue painting her as a villain. In the present day, Aurora is queen of the Moors, presiding over all magical creatures. The fairies Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple), and Flittle (Lesley Manville) come by to tell Aurora something, along with a little porcupine fairy called Pinto. She steals Aurora's crown and leads her to chase after her, only for Aurora to fall in the river. As she walks out, she is met by Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). Aurora realizes what is going on, and Phillip proposes to her. She accepts, to the delight of all the fairies. However, Diaval (Sam Riley) overhears this and flies over to tell Maleficent. Before he can finish his sentence, a very unhappy Maleficent swoops down to go find Aurora.In Ulstead, Phillip rides with General Percival (David Gyasi) back to the kingdom. Like most of the other people in Ulstead, Percival views Maleficent and the Moorfolk as murderous monsters. Phillip goes to his parents, King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) to deliver the news that Aurora has accepted his proposal. They both congratulate him, and they plan on having both Aurora and Maleficent present for a dinner. We then see Ingrith travel to a lower level in the castle where she has several workers forging weapons. She meets a servant of hers, Lickspittle (Warwick Davis), who is in the process of creating something dangerous by using a particular flower. It is also shown that Ingrith is using the cursed spindle as part of her plan.Maleficent flies down to meet with Aurora. She openly voices her approval over the engagement, but Aurora just wants Maleficent and Phillip's family to get along. Maleficent knows that she is not wanted in Ulstead, but for Aurora's sake, she promises to show up and behave. Diaval helps her practice being polite, while Aurora gives her a veil to cover her horns so as to make the people in the kingdom more comfortable.Maleficent travels with Aurora and Diaval into Ulstead to meet John and Ingrith. Things first seem wrong when Ingrith deliberately places iron silverware out, knowing full well how iron hurts fairies. Ingrith starts to pile on by bringing up Maleficent's curse and the disappearance of the men in the moors, suggesting she may have had something to do with it. The final straw comes when Ingrith says that Aurora will now have a real mother once she marries Phillip. Maleficent rages out and spreads her wings to intimidate everyone. When she demands to Aurora that they leave, John suddenly appears to fall ill before fainting. Ingrith makes everyone believe that Maleficent has cursed John, but she denies it to Aurora. When Aurora won't join her, Maleficent flies away. Ingrith has her henchwoman Gerda (Jenn Murray) fire iron at Maleficent, causing her to fall into the ocean. Moments later, a creature resembling her swoops down and rescues her.John is laid in his bedroom. Aurora and Phillip suggest that Ingrith use ""true love's kiss"" on him to wake him up. Since she obviously doesn't love him and is, in fact, the one who cursed him, it doesn't work. Gerda then reports to Ingrith about the other creature that grabbed Maleficent.Maleficent wakes up to find her wound tended to. She wanders and comes across a gathering of other Dark Fairies (or ""Feys""), including Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the one who saved her. Co-leader Borra (Ed Skrein) views the humans as the enemy, blaming them for the disappearance of the fairies. They see Maleficent, and Borra goes over to mock her association with a human. This makes her mad enough to demonstrate her power against Borra, which he actually finds great as he thinks they can use her power against the humans. Conall then takes Maleficent across the land, which is a hidden society of other fairies that possess unique powers. Conall also shows Maleficent that she is descended from a fairy phoenix, but her ancestor used her power for dark purposes and was crystallized. He warns Maleficent about using that kind of power.Pinto sneaks into the castle and finds the mushroom fairy, but she gets captured by Lickspittle and placed along the other stolen fairies. Meanwhile, Aurora is staying in the castle, with Ingrith pretending to be loving toward her, but it becomes clear she is controlling, as she prefers Aurora wear her old wedding dress instead of the one that the three fairies made for her.Lickspittle is then shown to have completed Ingrith's weapon. He shows her how it works - the pieces of the flower are mixed with iron powder to turn it red and make it instantly lethal to fairies. Lickspittle grabs a poor dandelion fairy and causes it to burst into dust with the slightest touch of the powder. Ingrith gets ready to use it and has Gerda invite (or rather, demand) the Moorfolk to attend Aurora and Phillip's wedding.In the midst of a celebration, Maleficent senses something is not right. She flies to the Moors and finds that Ingrith's soldiers have taken the flowers. They have also ambushed her and fire iron bullets at her, but Conall dives in to save her, wounding himself. The other fairies fight off the soldiers and return to lay Conall to rest. Borra proclaims to the other fairies that Ingrith has initiated a war against them, and they will fight together as an army. Maleficent stays by Conall's side as he dies, in which he transfers his essence to her while he becomes part of the earth.The Moorfolk begin to arrive in the kingdom for the ceremony. Aurora then senses something from the spot on her finger where she had been pricked. She comes across Ingrith's secret lair and finds the spindle, which allows her to see that Ingrith stabbed John with a cursed end. She also discovers that Lickspittle is a pixie who was forced to work for Ingrith after she took his wings. Ingrith finds Aurora and has her guards imprison her.Ingrith has all the Moorfolk locked inside the chapel as Gerda begins to release the red powder inside, which kills some of the tree folk. Outside, Maleficent and Borra lead the other fairies to fight back, but they are hit with numerous powder bombs, instantly killing some of them and forcing them to fall back. Aurora tells Phillip what his mother has done, and when he learns the truth from Ingrith, who shows no remorse, Phillip defies her and jumps off the tower, escaping on a balloon. Borra swoops down and almost kills Percival when he attempts to strike another fairy, but Phillip intervenes. He tells Borra he doesn't want his mother's war, and he refuses to have fairy blood on his hands. Maleficent witnesses this and realizes Phillip can be trusted. She still goes after his mother and faces her on the tower. Meanwhile, after one more tree creature sacrifices himself to save the three fairies, Flittle flies into the organ to sacrifice herself, causing her essence to fill the organ with flowers that stop the powder from spreading. Knotgrass and Thistlewit then fly in Gerda's face, causing her to fall off the balcony to her death.Aurora runs up to stop Maleficent from killing Ingrith, saying she knows that she is not as evil as they say she is. Ingrith then fires an arrow at Aurora, but Maleficent takes the hit and disintegrates. As Aurora weeps, Ingrith tells her that she is the one who spread the stories about Maleficent being evil, as she wanted to take control of the Moors by wiping out the creatures there. Aurora's tears then cause Maleficent to regenerate into her powerful phoenix form. She causes the nearby tower to collapse, and Ingrith makes one last cowardly move by throwing Aurora off the tower. Maleficent goes to save her, and they tumble across the ground. As Ingrith tries to escape, she is found by Borra and the other fairies. Outside, Maleficent asks Phillip if he truly loves Aurora, and he says he truly does. Maleficent gives her blessing, and Lickspittle comes to give her the cursed knife that Ingrith used. Maleficent breaks the curse, causing the spindle to disappear and for John to wake up. Ingrith is then dropped out of the castle through vines before Maleficent turns her into a goat for her punishment. Phillip is happy to see his father again, and they both decide they'll wait to let Ingrith turn human again.Aurora and Phillip are officially married, with Maleficent walking her down the aisle, and the humans and fairies are integrated into both kingdoms. Knotgrass and Thistlewit argue over what color Aurora's dress should be until a nearby flower turns it blue, implying that Flittle might still be alive. Maleficent goes to rejoin the other fairies as she bids the new couple farewell, but cheekily promises to be back for their baby's christening.The film ends with Maleficent flying away across the sky with the fairies."
Glass,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6823368/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Security guard David Dunn uses his supernatural abilities to track Kevin Wendell Crumb, a disturbed man who has twenty-four personalities. After pursuing Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities that reside within, David Dunn finds himself locked in a mental hospital alongside his archenemy, Elijah Price. The trio must now contend with a psychiatrist, who is out to prove they do not actually possess superhuman abilities.—vsuperkuns Following the conclusion of ""Split"", ""Glass"" finds David Dunn (Bruce Willis) pursuing Kevin Wendell Crumb's (James McAvoy) superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men. Nearly two long decades after the life-altering events inUnbreakable (2000)and the grotesque emergence of the powerful ""Beast"" persona inSplit (2016), the now-grizzled avenger of the innocent--David Dunn, or ""The Overseer""--still tries to track down the Horde and the elusive kidnapper, Kevin Wendell Crumb. However, a mysterious new adversary in the person of the determined and silver-tongued psychiatrist, Dr Ellie Staple, has made it her mission to convince David, Kevin, and Raven Hill Memorial's wheel-bound brittle-boned inmate, Elijah Price, that the delusional super-humans are, in fact, mere mortals. Now, the stage seems set for the ultimate revelation, against the backdrop of an imminent deadly confrontation. Is there a moment of life beyond what fate has predestined?—Nick Riganas A man with multiple personality disorder and seemingly superhuman abilities is murdering young women. He is tracked down by David Dunn, a man who also appears to have superhuman abilities. Both are committed to a psychiatric institution where they meet a mysterious, wheelchair-ridden man, Mr. Glass.—grantss Nearly 20 years after turning in Elijah Price to the authorities at the end ofUnbreakable (2000), David Dunn has embraced his superhuman vigilante ego dubbed ""The Overseer"" and is aided by his now adult son Joseph. After apprehending two male delinquents who have assaulted a man for views on the internet, Dunn returns to his business of ""Dunn Home Security"". It is revealed that he is hunting after Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde/The Beast after his exploits inSplit (2016), which in this film occurred three weeks ago. Upon returning home, David struggles with the fact that his wife left him, not able to cope with her husband's superhuman exploits and beliefs.Meanwhile, Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde has kidnapped a small group of cheerleaders and holds them hostage, preparing to feed them to the Beast in an abandoned factory. Dunn walks through the streets the next morning, brushing against people who pass him by in the crowds in order to see into their past and deduce who the Beast is. He brushes against the nine-year-old personality of Kevin and sees a flashback of him speaking to corpses of young women his ego the Beast had just killed. That night, while Kevin transforms into the Beast and presumably attacks a group of homeless people, Dunn dons the rain-slicker overcoat of the Overseer and arrives at the factory. After freeing the girls, he is attacked by the Beast who is quicker and more agile than him. But Overseer is stronger than the Beast, and when the Beast attempts to crush him, Overseer leaps out of a nearby window, causing them both to land in the streets below.The two rise up and charge each other once more but are stopped by a group of police led by a mysterious woman who encourages Dunn to give himself up to avoid hurting officers of the law. The Beast is reduced to a confused and scared Kevin by the flashing lights that the police have. The two are then arrested and brought to Raven Hill Memorial Institution. Joseph watches helplessly as his father and Kevin are placed in holding cells. Dunn is placed in a room with water sprinklers which will go off if he attempts to escape. Kevin is held in a room with hypnosis lights meant to flash should he ever show outright forms of violence. Also at Raven Hill is Elijah Price, still serving his time for bombing the Eastrail 177 in order to find David Dunn and discover his powers of physical invincibility. The mysterious woman from earlier reveals herself to be Dr. Ellie Staple, a psychiatrist.Ellie Staple tries to convince the men that they are normal people with compulsions of grandeur but consistently fails. She then tries to appeal to Price's mother, Joseph Dunn, and Casey Cooke, former victim and friend of Kevin, but fails again. Staple gives the men three days to be convinced that they are deluded figures and not superhumans, otherwise they will be brought to trial for their crimes. Staple then calls Dunn and Kevin into a room to test their psyches. However, a seemingly dormant and unresponsive Elijah Price (still wheelchair-bound from the broken spine he received from his fall down a flight of stairs inUnbreakable (2000)) is wheeled in and brought alongside the men, much to David Dunn's disgust in being associated with him. During the meeting, Staple recalls Kevin's past abuse from his mother which spurred the transformation of the Horde, as well as the time David was nearly drowned in a swimming pool which nearly killed him--the first time water was revealed to be his kryptonite. She then tests Price's psyche by recalling a time in which he broke his arm on a ride at a carnival, bringing to mind the extreme fragility of his bones.Later that night, Elijah Price breaks free from his cell and meets with Kevin who is in his ""Patricia"" personality. After an intelligent discussion, Elijah Price reveals that he has not been taking his sedative medication, instead hiding it inside his wheelchair, thus keeping his wits about him and remaining sharp as ever. He encourages Kevin/Patricia to meet with him the next night and show him the ""Beast."" Before Price leaves, Kevin/Patricia asks what his name is. Price turns his head and replies, ""First name Mister...Last name...Glass.""Upon returning to his room, Price is captured by Staple who performs a pre-frontal lobotomy on him knowing that his genius must be quelled before he can put any plan into motion. The seemingly brain-dead Price is brought back to his cell but suddenly comes alive and kills his caretaker by slashing his throat with a shard of broken glass. It is then revealed that Price had planned to be caught by Staple, and had sabotaged the machine earlier should the operation be conducted on him. Price then escapes to Kevin's cell and deactivates the ""hypnotic lights."" He and Kevin make their way to a secret room where Kevin transforms into the Beast and looks over Price, discovering that he has been broken. The Beast immediately takes a liking to Price but not before Price explains his plan to have the Beast and the Overseer battle each other at the top of the just-erected highest skyscraper in the city of Philadelphia. It is there that the whole world will see and discover that superheroes do indeed exist. The Beast agrees and helps Price make his way through the facility.Price then communicates with David in his cell and explains that he had deactivated the water sprinklers. He encourages David to escape but David initially refuses. Price then explains that should David refuse to escape and fight the Beast, Price will blow up a chemical company, killing many people. Having no other choice, David reluctantly breaks down the door, dons his rain slicker, and runs out of the institution.Price and Beast begin by confronting an orderly who had maltreated Price years earlier. The Beast crushes the orderly and forces him to kneel before Price before beating him to death as Price watches, shaking his head at the man's stubbornness. The Beast then wheels Price through the halls, beating down every security force that tries to hinder them. The Beast captures two nurses and forces them into a van where he keeps them hostage. Two police officers show up but the Beast makes short work of them.Price's mother, Joseph, and Casey arrive in time to see the Beast notice the Overseer approaching. Price sits back in his wheelchair and watches in excitement as the Beast charges Overseer and the two engage in a fight. Staple also sees this and calls up security. Casey rushes out, hoping to calm Kevin down but he is too busy fighting Overseer. Price recognizes her as ""the one the Beast let go"" and smiles in fascination at her. Armed police arrive and separate Overseer from the Beast, but are quickly overpowered. Overseer manages to push the forces attacking him into an enclosed compartment before locking them in while the Beast manages to kill and eat some of his attackers. Overseer frees the nurses the Beast held hostage before being attacked by the Beast. Price had informed the Beast that the Overseer's weakness is water and directed him to a water tank the institution uses.Joseph intervenes and explains to Kevin that Kevin's father was on the Eastrail 177 as well which Price had destroyed, thus killing Kevin's father and creating the Beast. Upon hearing this, Price is overcome with delight and amazement upon realizing he created both a superhero and a supervillain, and declares himself a mastermind. The Beast thanks Price for creating him, but then explains that he must protect Kevin at all costs--right before breaking Price's collarbone. Overseer tries to distract Beast from Price, saying that his fight is with him, which Price finds amusing. The Beast then punches Price in the chest, breaking his ribs which in turn pierce his lungs and mortally wound him. Price exclaims with pain and falls out of his wheelchair, dying upon the ground.The Beast flings Overseer/David Dunn into the water tank and fights him in there, easily overpowering him. Dunn manages to break through the wall and the two splash out onto the institution's lawn. The water from the tank pours out as well and fills a nearby pothole. The Beast says to Dunn that they will finish their battle at the top of the skyscraper and begins running off in that direction. Staple convinces Casey to calm the Beast down to avoid any other violence and she agrees. Casey catches up to the Beast and appeals to him, causing him to calm down and revert to the innocent Kevin. Once his defenses are down, a sniper shoots Kevin in the stomach now that the bulletproof skin of the Beast is gone. Kevin bleeds out and begins dying.More police forces show up and Joseph asks them to help his father as he is very weak. One of the security forces grabs David and drags him over to the water-filled pothole, forcibly drowning his face in it. David is too weak to fight back and is easily overcome. Staple arrives and orders the guard to wait as she grabs David's hand. He then sees a flashback to her life in which she is a member of a secret society monitoring the actions and works of superhuman beings, quelling them should they draw too much attention. She tells David that if she convinced him he was human she would have let him live, but Price's and the Beast's machinations prevented that. She then leaves and David realizes his true insignificance as the guard repeatedly bashes David's face into the puddle, ruthlessly drowning him.Kevin dies in Casey's arms, finally finding the light and finding peace in the safety of his friend's arms. Elijah lays dying in the parking lot, a broken and pitiful mess. Staple arrives and tells him that she and members of her following have suppressed superhuman masterminds to retain a safe society preventing overarching divides of ""gods"" among men. After Staple leaves, Elijah Price's mother kneels over her dying son. Price explains painfully that he was not a mistake to which his mother smiles proudly at him saying, ""No. You were spectacular."" Price smiles wryly and dies peacefully.Believing her mission a success, Staple deletes the footage of all the security cameras which recorded the fight between Overseer and Beast. However, upon closer examination she realizes that Price had hacked the computers and livestreamed all the events to a private network. Thus, it was never Price's plan to escape the facility and force the Beast to battle Overseer at the top of the skyscraper, as such a plan would be too elaborate. His plan and everything he had worked for was now a complete success. Staple leaves the security room and screams in anger realizing her failure. Price's mother, Joseph, and Casey receive copies of the footage and upload it, revealing it all to the public in the Philadelphia skyscraper. The film ends with them sitting together as the videos of Overseer and the Beast and their fantastic feats are relayed and spread to everyone's feed and the daily news, revealing the world of superheroes to the public.The main title of ""Glass"" appears on the screen one last time and the end credits are laced with shards of glass through which scenes from the film as well as the previous films ofUnbreakable (2000)andSplit (2016), connecting the whole story together."

Little Women,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jo March reflects back and forth on her life, telling the beloved story of the March sisters - four young women, each determined to live life on her own terms. In nineteenth-century Massachusetts, with their father away serving in the Civil War, the women of the March family--the loving matriarch, Marmee, and her four daughters, Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth--are left all alone to fend for themselves. Faced with genteel poverty, the fledgeling author, Jo March, is struggling to make a name for herself in male-dominated New York City; considerate Meg is now married, and the artistically inclined, Amy, is in Paris with their affluent Aunt March. However, the news of talented Beth's illness will reunite the sisters under the same roof. But, more than anything in the world--much to the disappointment of the handsome next-door neighbour, Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence--the fiercely independent Jo yearns for freedom. Must all stories end with a wedding?—Nick Riganas In 1868, Jo March is a teacher in New York City. She goes to an editor, Mr. Dashwood, who agrees to publish a story she has written. Her sister Amy, in Paris with their Aunt March, sees their childhood friend Laurie and invites him to a party. There, she becomes angry at his drunken behavior, and he mocks her for spending time with wealthy businessman Fred Vaughn. In New York, Jo is hurt when Friedrich Bhaer, a professor infatuated with her, constructively criticizes her writing, and she ends their friendship. After receiving a letter that her younger sister Beth's illness has worsened, Jo returns home.Seven years earlier, Jo and her three sisters live in Concord, Massachusetts. At a party with her older sister Meg, Jo befriends Laurie, the grandson of their neighbor, Mr. Laurence. On Christmas morning, the girls' mother, ""Marmee"", persuades her daughters to give their breakfast to their poor neighbor, Mrs. Hummel, and her starving children. Returning home, the girls find their table full of food from Mr. Laurence, and a letter from their father fighting in the American Civil War. Jo visits their Aunt March, who invites her to Europe. Laurie notices Amy standing outside, having been hit by her teacher for misbehaving in class, and invites her in before her family comes to take her home.When Meg, Jo, Laurie, and John - Laurie's tutor and Meg's eventual husband - go to the theatre, a jealous Amy burns Jo's writings, deeply upsetting Jo. The next morning Amy, wanting to make up with Jo, chases her onto a lake where Jo and Laurie are skating. They save Amy when she falls through the ice. Mr. Laurence invites Beth to play the piano in his house, as she reminds him of his late daughter. In the present, Laurie visits Amy to apologize for his behavior. He urges her not to marry Fred, but to marry him instead. Though in love with Laurie, Amy refuses, upset at always being ""second to Jo"". She later turns down Fred's proposal, only to learn Laurie has left for London.In the past, Marmee learns the girls' father is ill from the war, and leaves to visit him. Mr. Laurence gives the piano to Beth, who contracts scarlet fever from the Hummels. Amy, who has not had the disease before, is sent to stay with Aunt March. Marmee comes home early when Beth gets worse, but she recovers in time for Christmas, and their father returns home. In the present, Beth's condition worsens, and she dies. In the past, on Meg's wedding day, Jo tries to convince her to run away, but Meg says she is happy marrying John. Aunt March announces her trip to Europe, but takes Amy instead of Jo. After the wedding, Laurie admits his feelings for Jo, but she insists she does not feel the same.In the present, Marmee reveals that a devastated Amy is returning from Europe with a sick Aunt March. Jo wonders if she was too quick to turn Laurie down and writes a letter for him. Preparing to leave, Amy tells Laurie she turned down Fred's proposal; they kiss and later marry on the journey home. Laurie and Jo agree just to be friends, and Jo throws away the letter she wrote him. She begins writing a novel based on the lives of her and her sisters, and sends the first chapters to Mr. Dashwood, who is unimpressed. Bhaer turns up at the March house on his way to California.In New York, Mr. Dashwood's daughters demand to know how Jo's book ends. He agrees to publish the book, but finds it unacceptable that the main character is unmarried. Jo amends her ending so that the main character, herself, chases after Bhaer and stops him from going to California. She negotiates copyright and royalties with Mr. Dashwood. Later, Jo has inherited Aunt March's house and opened it as a school, where Meg, Amy, and Bhaer all teach. Jo observes the printing of her book, titled Little Women."
The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513498/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: Lego Duplo invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild. Just moments after Emmet Brickowski (voice of Chris Pratt) and his friends saved their city of Bricksburg, they are visited by aliens from the planet Duplo. This comes just after their real-world builder Finn (voice of Jadon Sand) is told by his father (voice of Will Ferrell) that his little sister is now allowed to play with Legos. After the Duplos threatens to destroy the Lego people, Emmet approaches them with a heart that he builds as a peace offering, only for the Duplo leader to eat it. Lucy, AKA Wyldstyle (voice of Elizabeth Banks) tries to attack, but this just makes the alien scream powerfully enough to shatter windows. The Duplos start to rampage across Bricksburg, causing structures to collapse. Emmet and Lucy get help from Batman (voice of Will Arnett), Unikitty (voice of Alison Brie), Metalbeard (voice of Nick Offerman), and Benny (Charlie Day), but they are outmatched and defeated. Meanwhile, President Business (also Will Ferrell) ditches them to go golfing.Five years later, Bricksburg has become Apocalypseburg, with everyone adjusting to their new city by being dark, brooding, and edgy. Lucy says that the Justice League - Superman (voice of Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman (voice of Cobie Smulders), Aquaman (voice of Jason Momoa), Green Lantern (voice of Jonah Hill), and Cyborg - went off to fight the Duplos, but they never returned. Batman stayed behind to do a standalone adventure and is now living in a large fortress with Alfred (voice of Ralph Fiennes). Emmet is the only one who retains his cheerful disposition. He joins Lucy with some coffee, but she is too busy brooding. Emmet then mentions having a crazy dream in which he saw a dolphin clock with a time of 5:15, and a black hole opening that swallows all of his friends in an event called ""Ourmamageddon"". He then shows Lucy that he built them a house just outside of the city, and he brings her over to check it out. While she thinks it's nice, she worries it will attract unwanted attention, and she also thinks Emmet is too childish. Her fears are confirmed when a ship descends toward the city and spots Emmet, Lucy, and Unikitty (who is now huge and goes by Ultrakitty). The pilot fires a heart bomb at the trio, who run away after building an escape buggy. However, they are followed because Emmet puts his blinker on.They make it to Batman's fortress where they hide from the invader, and Batman attempts to fire at them, but it doesn't work. The invader makes her way in and introduces herself as General Sweet Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz). She seeks out the leader of the group, and Lucy points Emmet out as ""The Special"". Mayhem disagrees and doesn't see anything special about Emmet. She proceeds to kidnap Lucy, Batman, Unikitty, Benny, and Metalbeard and take them with her. Emmet tries to get the other citizens to help him save his friends, but they don't want to join him due to him being immature. Emmet sets off on his own to rescue his friends by converting his house into a ship.Mayhem brings the Master Builders to the Systar System where she lives. She takes them to a planet ruled by the shape-shifting Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi (voice of Tiffany Haddish). Watevra appears like an evil tyrant, but she does her best to persuade the heroes that she is the complete opposite of a villain by singing a song about it. She manages to persuade the others by appealing to their interests (spaceships for Benny, cute stuff for Unikitty, pirate stuff for Metalbeard, and just appealing to Batman's ego). Everyone but Lucy is convinced that she can be trusted. Watevra wants to marry Batman and unite their worlds, which startles him.Emmet is making his way through space, only to come across a glassteroid storm. Just before he collides with one, he is saved by the super cool Rex Dangervest (also Chris Pratt), flying in a ship shaped like a fist. He brings Emmet on-board and introduces himself as a galaxy-defending cowboy/raptor trainer (in other words, Chris Pratt's most famous roles). Rex tells Emmet his backstory of how he was left trapped under the dryer in Finn's home and was forgotten by his friends, but he managed to pull himself out and become who he is now. He has a whole control center with raptors that he trained. Rex then decides to join Emmet in his quest to save his friends.The Master Builders are brought to Planet Sparkles in preparations for the wedding. Lucy is given a wash, revealing that the black in her hair is painted, and her real hair is blue. Watevra's assistants - Ice Cream Cone (voice of Richard Ayoade), Banarnar (voice of Ben Schwartz), and Balthazar (voice of Noel Fielding) - try to get Lucy as pumped up as they are by forcing her to listen to the upbeat ""Catchy Song"". She escapes and finds herself crawling through a vent next to Bruce Willis (voicing himself as a Lego).At the same time, Emmet and Rex appear on the same planet with other Lego Mini-Figures people. Emmet finds everybody to be overly happy and friendly. The Justice League are there, and Superman is now best buds with Green Lantern (whom he couldn't stand before) and even Lex Luthor (voice of Ike Barinholtz). They also go along and sing ""Catchy Song"", which Rex finds painful.Batman and Watevra have a private dinner together. Mayhem scans Batman and detects that he is hiding his insecurities under his ego, which Watevra implies is not unlike her. He admits that he is not looking to get hitched, but Watevra responds that she only said she wanted to marry him to make her real crush jealous. This starts to make Batman walk back on his words, just as Watevra starts to sing a song about why she's not into Gotham City guys. Batman relents and makes an official proposal to her.Numerous citizens gather on top of a giant wedding cake for Batman and Watevra's wedding. Lucy meets up with Emmet and Rex as they both plan to stop the ceremony by smashing the wedding cake. Rex is suspicious of Lucy and thinks she is brainwashed, but Emmet trusts her. As they proceed with their plan, Lucy runs into Mayhem, and in the confrontation, Mayhem is knocked off a ledge. Her helmet falls off, and her deepened tough voice is gone, and she appears genuinely frightened as she holds on for dear life. She slips but Lucy manages to catch her. Mayhem explains that she and Watevra really aren't bad, and that they just wanted to unite their worlds. This leads Lucy to realize that Rex is the true villain, as he is trying to keep everyone apart. Outside, Lucy watches the ceremony and sees Watevra take her true form - the heart that Emmet built all those years earlier for the Duplos. Before Lucy can stop Emmet, he harnesses his ""grown-up"" power and smashes the cake, which causes everything to fall into ruin and tear open a hole.Everything that happens is a result of the real world where Finn's sister Bianca (voice of Brooklynn Prince) has brought Finn's Legos into her room so that they can play together, but Finn is a jerk and he breaks Bianca's creations. Their mother (voice of Maya Rudolph) comes in and scolds them for fighting, and because the Legos hurt her bare feet, she orders the kids to put the pieces away in a storage bin (the black hole). This makes Emmet's nightmare of Ourmamageddon come true, as the kids pick up all the Legos and leave them trapped in the darkness of the storage bin.After Emmet realizes what has happened, Rex tells him the truth - he is Emmet from the future! On his trip to save his friends, Emmet ended up under the dryer and was left alone, just watching Finn play without him. He became bitter and forced himself out of the dryer where he made a new tougher, mature image for himself and shunned all the cute and childish things he once valued. He made himself a time machine using bits from the DeLorean, Bill and Ted's phone booth, the Tardis, an H.G. Wells contraption, and a hot tub, and he used it to go back in time to find Emmet before he got lost. Since Emmet doesn't agree with his plans, Rex tosses him out of the ship and back under the dryer.Lucy, Mayhem, and the Master Builders all feel sad and sing about how everything is NOT awesome, but this doesn't mean that it has to be the end for them. In the real world, Finn realizes that he was rotten to Bianca and remembers how much fun they had playing together when they were younger, and he makes amends with her by bringing her the Watevra heart. Meanwhile, Emmet is stuck under the dryer and attempts to free himself, but he has limited movement down there. Rex joins him to fight and keep him there, but now that Finn and Bianca are playing, Lucy is free and she goes to help Emmet, and they use one of Mayhem's heart bombs to defeat Rex. Rex realizes how wrong he was, but now that Lucy has come to save Emmet, it means that Rex won't exist. He starts to disappear but bids farewell to Emmet and Lucy. The two are then reunited with their friends.Finn and Bianca combine their worlds so that all the residents now live in harmony. President Business returns from his golf trip but gets kicked out of town almost immediately. Lucy rebuilds her and Emmet's home and presents him with a surprise: an original album of ""Everything is Awesome"". Emmet looks closely and sees Lucy on the cover, and it slowly dawns on him that she was one of the original artists behind the song."

In 2007, Destiny (Constance Wu) begins her job at a strip club. As the new girl, she makes a little bit of money, but after having to pay out multiple people at the club, there's not that much left over.

Destiny says it was one of the best times she ever had.Then, in 2008, the recession hits and hits Wall Street especially hard. Wall Street types were the bread and butter of the industry, and now many of them either have little or no many to spend or spend much less. The club becomes a bit of a ghost town. Destiny meets and starts dating a man who quickly gets her pregnant and she stops working at the club.In 2011, Destiny gets into a screaming breakup with her boyfriend and kicks him out for good. Now faced with providing for her daughter and her grandmother, Destiny calls her old client who bought her the computer - only to find he's now married and can't take give her anything. She tries to get a job in retail, but the interviewer finds her resume unimpressive. She reluctantly returns to the club, but finds it much different - the club mom (Mercedes Ruehl) explains that times have changed - many of her friends are gone, now replaced with Russian girls who will provide sexual favors (something the old girls didn't do) for cheaper than ever, and business is low - there's less money to be made.Destiny is in an extremely low place when she runs into Ramona, and the two happily reunite. They got out to a diner to catch up. Ramona tells her what she's been up to: Ramona and Mercedes had gotten regular jobs in retail, but the money was barely enough and Ramona's boss is degrading to her. One night at the club, Ramona finds Annabelle (Lili Reinhart), crying alone in the dressing room. Her family has disowned her after finding out she works there. Ramona saw a business opportunity - to go ""fishing"". Since there was no business in the club, she would go and find men to bring. She recruits Mercedes and Annabelle, and the three of them would go to a bar, find an eligible man, then ply him with drinks and bring him back to the club where they would run up his credit card and keep a percentage of whatever he spends. This worked pretty well, but sometimes Ramona would dose the man's drink with a mix of ketamine and MDMA (ecstasy) and then get him to the club and run up his credit card. Ramona asks Destiny if she wants in: she says yes, as long as no one gets hurt.Everything goes well. Ramona, Destiny, Mercedes and Annabelle are making wads of cash. They end up needing to recruit more girls to the team in order to handle all the business. Ramona has a lavish Christmas party for everyone, and Destiny brings her grandmother. They all give each other presents and laugh together, a makeshift family. But soon, around 2013, other girls start copying their business plan at the club. Ramona wonders why they have to cut the clubs in on anything, and decides instead to instead begin working out of hotels or other venues they control - more money, but also less safety. They have to recruit even more girls who they can't vet, like the shifty Dawn (Madeline Brewer). Ramona and Destiny argue over methods - Ramona will run up a guy's credit card to the limit on the first night, assuring he'll never come back, even though Destiny knows that man could have been a repeat client. Because of this, they burn through their regulars and have to find new, potentially untrustworthy clients.One night, Destiny gets a panicked call from Mercedes. A client on drugs jumped off his roof and missed his pool, landing on the concrete. Destiny tries to reach Ramona, but can't get a hold of her. Destiny and Annabelle go over and help Mercedes get the naked client into a car and they drop him off at the hospital. Destiny returns, in full a trashy outfit with blood on it, to drop her daughter off at school. After that full ordeal, she returns home to find her grandmother has passed away. At the funeral, Ramona holds Destiny as she cries.Elizabeth asks Destiny if Doug was the last straw for her - Doug was a genuinely nice guy who had been through a terrible series of events - his house was destroyed in a disaster and his wife abandoned him and his special-needs child. After the girls drug him and run up his credit card, he calls back, pleading with Destiny to refund his card so he can pay his mortgage. Destiny begins to feel bad and Ramona rips the phone away from her, calling her an ungrateful bitch. Doug, meanwhile, reaches out to the police. One of the cards they racked up was a corporate card and he has lost his job. They laugh him off initially, but he has evidence - a recording of his phone call with the girls. The police pick up Dawn and flip her incredibly easily - she wears a wire and participates in a sting operation. Another client comes forward, and eventually the police have enough evidence. They arrest Destiny, Ramona, Mercedes, and Annabelle.The police pressure Destiny that if she doesn't flip on the others, she'll never see her daughter again. Once they're released, Ramona tells Destiny she's getting them a lawyer, but Destiny tells her she took the deal, for her daughter. Ramona is furious at her, but mostly sad. The two hug and cry, knowing this is the end for them and their pseudo mother-daughter relationship, and Ramona leaves her behind.After the article comes out, Destiny calls Elizabeth, knowing she interviewed Ramona, and wants to know all the horrible things Ramona said about her. But Elizabeth tells her the truth - when she went to see Ramona, working at her new regular job, she still had a picture of Destiny in her wallet, like a proud mother. Destiny cries, and Elizabeth tells her she should reach out to her. In an on-screen closing text, we learn that Destiny avoided jail, Mercedes and Annabelle got probation and a few weekends in jail, and Ramona got five years probation.In the final shot, we see the four women joyfully dancing during their heyday of the scheme."

Rocketman,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2066051/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A musical fantasy about the fantastical human story ofElton John's breakthrough years. The film starts with superstar rocker Elton Hercules John (Taron Egerton) walking into a room while wearing a gaudy orange devil-type outfit like he's about to perform. It turns out he is really attending a group meeting for addicts. He sits down to join the group and explains that he is a drug and sex addict, plus an alcoholic, and he wants to get better before it gets worse. The group coordinator asks Elton to talk about his childhood.Starting with a series of flashbacks, Elton, then known simply as his birth name Reginald Kenneth ""Reggie"" Dwight (here played by Matthew Illesley), was a shy but polite child living in suburban Middlesex county in the 1950s (""The Bitch is Back"") with his emotionally vacant mother Sheila Eileen (Bryce Dallas Howard) and more loving grandmother Ivy (Gemma Jones). His domineering father Stanley (Steven Mackintosh) is even worse than his mother, as he constantly controls his son's actions and doesn't even bother with showing him affection. Reggie then starts to take an interest in music, and so Sheila and Ivy sign him up for piano lessons.In a jump forward to the 1960s, as a teenager (now played by Kit Connor), Reggie starts to attend a music academy in London to improve his skills. At one point, Reggie catches Sheila in a car with another man, Fred (Tom Bennett). Stanley finds out and uses it as an opportunity to leave for good. Reggie is distraught that Stanley didn't even bother to say goodbye to him.Reggie then plays at a nearby pub in front of Sheila and Ivy, plus a bunch of rude drunks. He shows off his talent (""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"") and grows into a performer where he joins his own band, Bluesology. The group gets booked to do shows for two quid a week each. They meet and play with another musician named Wilson (Jason Pennycooke) and his group. Reggie takes notes from him, and also starts to take his sexuality into account when Wilson kisses him before a show one night. Reggie even considers changing his name, taking ""Elton"" from the band's sax player Elton Dean (Evan Walsh), who doesn't approve of Reggie taking the name idea.Reggie then answers an ad from music executive Ray Williams (Charlie Rowe) and meets with him. He plays a bit of the piano for him and impresses Ray, and when he asks his name, Reggie officially calls himself Elton John (taking ""John"" from a framed picture of The Beatles' John Lennon). Ray's boss Dick James (Stephen Graham) comes in and orders Ray out of his office. Before Elton leaves, Ray gives him a folder with written songs in it and tells him to look them over.Now officially known as Elton John, he then contacts the songs' writer, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). The two meet for the first time in a restaurant where they express a shared love for music by singing ""Streets of Laredo"". The two live separately and collaborate for music, but when they present the songs to Dick, he calls it all rubbish and suggests the two live together so that they can work together and know how to write better music. Elton and Bernie then find a place to live in, and Elton begins to see their landlady, Arabella. However, Wilson and his band-mates know Elton is actually gay. He asks Bernie if he would have a problem with that, and Bernie sincerely tells him he has no problem with it. Unfortunately, when Arabella finds out, she kicks both men out, forcing them to go back and live with Sheila.Elton and Bernie start to create music that Dick loves (""Your Song""), and he books them shows in America at The Troubadour. They travel with Ray and meet the club's manager Doug Weston (Tate Donovan). Just before their debut performance, Elton hides in the bathroom and gets nervous when he hears that already established acts are performing before him, but Ray and Bernie make him go out to play. Elton gets behind the piano and starts to play ""Crocodile Rock"", which the whole audience loves and joins him onstage to dance to. Later, the guys attend a party at Mama Cass's where Elton meets music producer John Reid (Richard Madden). He liked what he heard from Elton, but also appears to have more than a musical interest in him. The two go to a room where they have sex.Upon returning to the UK, Elton and Bernie part ways with a dismayed Dick and Ray to start working for Reid. He helps build Elton's career and helps him skyrocket to superstar status. Meanwhile, Elton continues to struggle with personal problems. He pays Stanley a visit in his new home and sees that he has two young sons that he seems to care for more than he ever did with Elton. Stanley shows Elton that he has a record of his and asks if he could sign it, but rather for a co-worker of his instead of himself. As Elton leaves Stanley for the last time, he sees the man pick up one of his sons affectionately, bringing Elton to tears. In the present day as he recounts this, he becomes angered and throws his chair, and also starts to gradually shed his outfit.Elton is seen recording ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" with Kiki Dee (Rachel Muldoon), but he has them take a quick break so that he and Reid can have sex in a nearby room.On their way to a show, Elton orders the driver to stop a car so he can run to a phone booth and call Sheila to come out to her. She says she has always known and doesn't really care about it, but she tells her son that he is choosing to be alone forever. After the call, Reid shows his more abusive and controlling side by ordering Elton to get himself together and perform. Elton even later catches him receiving a blowjob from his secretary. To hide his sorrows and insecurities, Elton starts to drink, do drugs, and wear flashy but ridiculous outfits.Elton starts to become more emotionally unstable and depressed. During a party, he takes a handful of pills and a large swig of vodka before going to the pool to announce to everyone that he is going to kill himself. He falls into the pool and lets himself sink to the bottom where he sees a vision of himself as a child playing ""Rocketman"". The other party-goers and medics pull Elton out of the water and have his stomach pumped. This transitions to him performing ""Rocketman"" in concert.Sometime later in the 1980's, Elton meets Renate Blauel (Celine Schoenmaker) and later marries her, but the marriage quickly proves to be a loveless sham, and they divorce soon enough.Elton finds out that Reid has been skimming money from his record sales. He wants to get rid of John, but the smug prick reminds him that he'll still be collecting his 20% even if Elton kills himself. Elton later has dinner with Sheila and Fred (whom she has long since married), which turns sour quick when they get into an argument, and Sheila says she has always found being his mother to be an embarrassment. This carries over to Elton and Bernie getting into a fight.Elton is set to perform at Madison Square Garden in the devil outfit he was seen in earlier, but as he starts to do some coke, his nose starts to bleed. Realizing he has a serious problem, he bails from the concert and heads to the group therapy session. With him finished telling his story, he then has a vision of every major person in his life (Sheila, Stanley, Ivy, Bernie, and Reid) talking to him. Ivy remains encouraging, and Elton says he no longer cares for his parents' opinions. He also doesn't feel controlled by Reid anymore, and he remains firm in his friendship with Bernie. He then sees his younger self and gives him the hug he always wanted. Elton later stays in a rehab center where he is visited by Bernie, who calls Elton his brother.Elton later gets better and continues to perform (""I'm Still Standing"").The final text states that Elton John has been sober for nearly 30 years. He organized a charity for people around the world with AIDS, and he has found love for the last 25 years with David Furnish. He and Bernie Taupin have been collaborating for the last 50 years, and they remain great friends to this day. Elton has recently retired from touring to focus on raising his sons Zachary and Elijah with David."

Invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max asks his best friends Lucas and Thor for some much-needed help on how to pucker up. When they hit a dead end, Max decides to use his father's drone to spy on the teenage girls next door. When the boys lose the drone, they skip school and hatch a plan to retrieve it before Max's dad can figure out what happened.—krmanirethnam HD. Three 12-year-old boys endure epic misadventures as they prepare for their first ""kissing"" party in this comedy. The film starts with Max (Jacob Tremblay) playing a fantasy online game. He enlarges the breasts on an orc before getting ready to masturbate. His father (Will Forte) comes in to let him know that he is going away for the weekend and to be careful with the new drone he has. Max's dad then realizes what his son was about to do and gives him ""the talk"" over it before going to tell his wife, leaving Max embarrassed.Max hangs out with his best friends Thor (Brady Noon) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams). Together, they call themselves ""The Bean Bag Boys"". They hang out at Thor's house where they are annoyed by his younger sister Annabelle. The boys then play a game where Thor ends up with a baseball card valued at up to $600.The next day, the boys go to the skate park so Max can check out his crush Brixlee (Millie Davis). He and Thor are then met by the ""cool"" boys, led by Atticus (Chance Hurstfield). He brings the boys to a hidden spot in the park where he pulls out a beer bottle. They take turns sipping it, but when it gets to Thor, he chickens out despite bragging about sipping tons of beers. Atticus starts to mock Thor and gives him the name ""Sippy Cup.""Lucas goes home to his parents (Retta and Lil Rel Howery) giving him his favorite meal (lasagna and orange soda), only to drop the news on him that they are getting a divorce.At school, the boys are in choir class, and Max can see that Lucas is upset, but he won't tell him or Thor about the divorce. Thor wants to sign up for the upcoming performance of ""Rock of Ages,"" but he backs out when Atticus sees him signing up and says singing is for ""try-hards."" Later during lunch, Max is called over by another popular boy named Soren (Izaac Wang). He invites Max to a ""kissing party"", where all the girls, including Brixlee, will attend. Max asks if he can invite Thor and Lucas too, but Soren thinks they are ""too random."" Max promises that they will be well-behaved.After school, the boys try to find out how to kiss to prepare for the party. They look up porn to try and see it for themselves, only to be disgusted at what they witness. They then find a sex doll (which they think is for CPR) and practice on it as well. The boys then use Max's dad's drone to spy on his neighbor Hannah (Molly Gordon) and her friend Lily (Midori Francis) to see how to kiss. They observe Hannah's sort-of boyfriend Benji (Josh Caras) coming over to deliver drugs, but after Hannah puts him in the friend zone, Benji rudely tells her off. The girls then see the drone in the sky and catch it with a pool net. The boys run over to try and get the drone back, but the girls refuse to do so due to the boys spying on them.When the boys get back to Max's house, Thor reveals he stole Hannah's bag. They dump out the contents and find a bottle of vitamins that they struggle to open. Hannah's phone then rings, and they tell the boys that there is something of value in the bag. They all meet up at the playground to make the exchange, but when the girls mention that there is molly in the bag, the boys are hesitant to give the drugs back to keep them off the streets. Max then gets the idea to use the drone's remote to fly it out of the girls' reach, but he accidentally ends up steering it into the path of a school bus, completely destroying the drone. The boys then run off to school to get away from the girls, but they beat them to the school first. Lucas then calls out for SCAB (the school's anti-bullying group) to protect them, but it only humiliates Max and Thor. They later hide in the bathroom and decide to skip school to try and get a new drone before Max's dad comes home.The boys go back to Thor's house to get the rare card to sell it. They find a buyer who agrees to get the card and will meet them at the house. The boys then get a bunch of ""weapons"" (actually sex toys) from Thor's parents' closet. The buyer, Claude (Stephen Merchant), arrives. The boys suspect he might be a pedophile, but after seeing he is harmless, they let him in. As they are about to give Claude the card, Lucas backs out and says the card is representative of their friendship. Claude then spots the sex doll, which the boys claimed was Thor's mom, and he offers them $400 for it. They take the money, and Claude leaves after saying he would have paid more for it.With the money in hand, the boys ride their bikes to the mall, but they are found by Hannah and Lily, who were tracking them because they still have Hannah's phone. The boys try to ride away from them, but Lily chases them on foot. Lucas ends up crashing his bike and flies into a truck, severely dislocating his arm. Max scares Lily away by telling the truck driver that she's their babysitter who is trying to molest them, so she bolts out of there and jumps back into Hannah's car. Max and Thor pull Lucas away and go to pop his arm back into place. During this time, Lucas admits that things won't hurt less since his parents are divorcing.The boys go to a convenience store to get medicine for Lucas, while Thor decides to smuggle a beer to impress the cool kids. A cop, Officer Sacks (Sam Richardson), walks in. Max and Lucas panic and try to act ""normal"", but Lucas cracks under pressure and admits they are carrying drugs. Thor also walks by trying to smuggle the beer in his pants, but Sacks takes the beer and the drugs and promises not to report them as long as they stop annoying him. Thinking he is lying, the boys lock him inside the store using one of Thor's parents' dildos. Thor also managed to sneak another beer in his jacket.The mall is in sight, but the boys discover they must cross a highway. They get past the first few lanes easily since traffic is moving easily, but once they get to the next set of lanes, the cars start moving faster. The boys get nervous, but Max runs first, followed by Lucas, and then Thor almost makes it but drops his beer and then causes a major accident as cars swerve to avoid hitting him. The boys then run to the mall, only to be told by the saleswoman at the store that the drone they ordered was sold to two girls - Hannah and Lily. They also left the boys a note for where to meet them.The boys meet the girls in a tunnel, where they reveal to Hannah and Lily that they don't have the drugs. They order Max, Thor, and Lucas to buy them again from Benji at his frat house, but Hannah reminds them not to say she sent them there. They almost succeed in getting the drugs, but Lucas once again blabs that Hannah sent them. Benji refuses to give up the drugs, so Max pulls out a paintball gun from Thor's house and demands that they get the drugs since he is desperate to go to the party. An air horn blows and startles Max, causing him to accidentally hit Benji with a paintball. His frat brothers start trying to fight the boys, but they keep getting hit with paint balls. Thor gets punched in the face, and Lucas accidentally flips a guy onto a table. They grab the drugs and run to the girls.The girls drop the boys off somewhere after making their trade, but Lucas and Thor no longer have interest in going to the party. Max then gets a call from his dad saying he got an early flight back and is headed home in 15 minutes. Max flies the drone back toward his house and enters through the chimney, but the camera lens gets covered in soot, making it hard to see. Max tries to navigate through memory and accidentally destroys his dad's office, but puts the drone back in place. His dad sees and angrily calls him to ground him. The boys then get into an argument as Max tells Thor and Lucas that Soren only invited him and not them. Max also calls Thor out on not auditioning for the play just because he cares what the other boys think. They all start crying and go home individually.Max's parents scold him as he takes the full blame for the day's events. Thor's mom informs him of this and thinks her boy is innocent. Lucas naturally tells his parents everything, but they think he is just stressed out over the divorce and just try to give him some helpful advice.Lucas goes to Max's house and convinces him to sneak out to go to the party. He tricks Max and Thor into meeting up again to try and reconcile, but neither one wants to deal with the other. The boys enter Soren's house and go to the basement. Thor takes out his beer bottle and tries to beat Soren's record of three sips. He makes it to four sips and is no longer known as ""Sippy Cup,"" which even impresses Soren. The kids then gather to play Spin The Bottle. After witnessing one kiss, Lucas is grossed out and he excuses himself to stay upstairs to play VR. Brixlee then spins, and the bottle points to Thor. Knowing how Max feels about her, Thor gives up his turn. Atticus starts trying to make fun of him again, but Max shuts him up. He follows Thor and tries to apologize for their fight, but he tells Max that what he said about him holding himself back is true. He encourages Max to go after what he wants. Max approaches Brixlee and asks to kiss her. She says yes, and Max gets his first kiss.Upstairs, Thor joins Lucas. Hannah and Lily show up, high off their gourds, as it is revealed that Lily is Soren's older sister. The girls ask the boys what they really want, and Lucas says he just wants to play video games. Thor admits his passion for singing, and the girls ask him to sing. He starts to sing ""I Wanna Know What Love Is."" This plays over a montage of him going to audition for ""Rock of Ages"", despite auditions being over, and he ends up winning the part of Stacee Jaxx. Over the next month, Max goes out with Brixlee, but she breaks up with him. He starts going out with another girl, Taylor, but she leaves him for Brixlee.

Max shows up with a new girlfriend, Scout, while Lucas is there with a new friend that plays video games with him. The boys acknowledge that while they may end up going separate ways, they vow to be together for all of the important events. The three share a big hug, but before they go, Thor invites Max and Lucas to go upstairs for a surprise. They go to his parents' room to find a giant swing. They play on it for a while until Annabelle comes in to tell them that their parents have sex in it."
Men in Black: International,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283336/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Men in Black have always protected the Earth from the scum of the universe. In this new adventure, they tackle their biggest threat to date: a mole in the Men in Black organization. After an eye-opening encounter of the third kind, the secret MiB organisation's newest recruit, Agent M, finds herself under the wing of the heroic Agent H in cosmopolitan London, when a shape-shifting duo of intergalactic assassins executes an alien aristocrat. Now, with a devastating super-weapon of mass destruction hidden somewhere on Earth, the Men in Black will leave no stone unturned to retrieve it. However, heavy clouds of mistrust and a scent of betrayal envelop the once-incorruptible agency. Is there a well-placed mole in their midst?—Nick Riganas Paris, France 2016Men in Black (MIB) Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) and London branch director High T (Liam Neeson) arrive at the Eiffel Tower to take out an alien invasion from the creatures calling themselves The Hive. If unleashed, they can wipe out everything in their path. After neuralyzing and shooing away a couple, H and T fight their way into a passage in the tower that leads to The Hive's base of entry. The agents arm themselves as the doors open, and the creatures emerge from the other side.In a flashback to 20 years earlier in Brooklyn, New York City, little Molly Wright (Mandeiya Flory) watches as two MIB agents talk to her parents outside as they are looking for a creature known as a Tarantian. Unbeknownst to them, the creature is in Molly's room, but she sees it as adorable and harmless. The agents neuralyze Molly's parents, but this moment changes her life.As an adult, Molly (now played by Tessa Thompson) has been going through different agencies trying to uncover the secret organization that she has been obsessed with finding since that fateful night, all while working a dead end desk job. She catches a reading of an anomaly on her computer, and she follows the reading to a street in New York where a hidden entry is uncovered when pigeons fly through but disappear. Molly enters and watches MIB agents at the scene of an alien sighting. She throws away her jacket revealing a black suit underneath and tries to sneak into the MIB headquarters, but she is scanned and identified as an unknown intruder. Molly is then met by Agent O (Emma Thompson) when the other agents take her in and attempt to neuralyze her. She saves herself by revealing that she knows all about them after what she saw, and she must have some qualifications to join since SHE found THEM. O is unconvinced until Molly says that she has no life and nothing to live for, and uncovering the truth might give her a purpose. O decides to allow her in as a probationary agent and gives her all that she needs to now become Agent M.In London, H is attempting to catch a known alien gangster during a card game, but he is outed as an MIB agent, and things get out of control as a venomous three-headed worm is set loose upon the place. The other aliens are killed, and both H and the head gangster are bitten, with the gangster's assistant holding the antidote. H convinces her he will give her anything for the cure... so they sleep together.Meanwhile, two alien creatures from the race known as Dyads (Laurent and Larry Bourgeois) arrive on Earth and steal a man's identity after killing him. They encounter small aliens resembling chess figures and try to negotiate to arrange a murder a Jababian. The queen's protector, Pawny (Kumail Nanjiani), attempts to defy the Dyads, until they make their seriousness known.M is sent to London via MIB's special subway. There, she meets High T and learns of MIB's monitoring alien activity from areas far outside the U.S., and they have been made aware of the Dyads' arrival on Earth, and as they are from a planet close to The Hive, the agents fear they may strike again. M soon sees H as he enters a meeting where T tells the agents that a member of the Jababian royal family, Vungus (Kayvan Novak), wants the agents to show him a good time. H is assigned to be Vungus's chaperon, and M manages to get herself in as his partner to join him on the case.M and H go to a nightclub to meet Vungus. H attempts to hook M up with Vungus, but she refuses. The Dyads show up there and infect Vungus with some kind of poison. As his guards bring him out with the agents following, Vungus's car gets blown up in the street. The Dyads emerge and attack, so M and H break out the big guns to fight back. However, the aliens prove to be almost unkillable, as they just absorb whatever energy the MIB hit them with. M goes to Vungus, who gives her a small crystal to keep in her protection. He doesn't trust H and thinks there's a threat within the MIB, and he dies soon after. The Dyads disappear, and the agents are met by Agent C (Rafe Spall), who chews them out for the disastrous outcome.M and H meet with C and T in the aftermath. C suggests they fire and neuralyze M, but H defends her. She brings her suggestion to T that someone in MIB could be a mole. T has more doubts in H's capabilities, as everyone thinks he isn't the same agent he once was. M and H then investigate the poison that Vungus was injected with, as H knows where it can be found. Meanwhile, C is shown surveillance footage of M in possession of the crystal.The agents travel to Marrakech where they find Nasr (also Kayvan Novak), a known dealer who has a living alien beard named Bassam (ALSO Kayvan Novak). They bring up H's relationship with a notorious alien arms dealer named Riza (Rebecca Ferguson). After the agents leave them, Nasr and Bassam spot the Dyads walking by. Nasr then orders Bassam to call Riza.M and H come across a shop where they find a dead body and a secret entrance where they find the dead chess aliens, save for Pawny. After the queen dies, he over-dramatically tries to kill himself, but M convinces him to help them since he is a witness, and Pawny pledges allegiance to M. They leave, and H shows M that he took the crystal from her, and he's disappointed that she didn't trust him enough to let him know. They then spot MIB agents approaching them as they were sent by C. They run back to Nasr and are given a hover bike to get them through the crowd. They escape the town but crash into the desert. T finds C's tactics unethical and it makes him consider that he is the mole. C thinks it's H who can't be trusted, but T still has faith in him.The three discover that the crystal is a super-compressed star that has been designed to be a powerful weapon of mass destruction, which could prove deadly in the hands (or tentacles) of The Hive. They witness its power at the lowest setting when M activates it on H's urging to try it and makes a canyon in the sand. They set up camp for the night and bond for a bit until they find that Bassam stowed away in their canteen, and he steals the crystal to take to Riza. The agents and Pawny fix the hover bike and fly to Riza's fortress.Upon arriving, H uses Pawny as a peace offering to Riza. She is still hung up on their break-up, and so she double-crosses H and tries to have him sent off the island by her henchmen. However, H fights them off and runs back. M makes her way into the fortress and fights Riza while H fights her Tarantian bodyguard Luca (Spencer Wilding). Riza orders him to kill them until M learns he is Tarantian, and she repeats a phrase that the little Tarantian taught her as a child. Luca realizes who M is, and he turns on Riza, but the agents let her off once she gives them back the crystal.As the agents prepare to leave, H tells M that his real name is Henry. Soon, they are cornered by the Dyads. H vows to protect the planet from The Hive, to which the Dyads reply that they are as well. MIB agents then show up and vaporize the Dyads with high voltage weapons. T comes out and congratulates the agents on their success.The other agents celebrate the victory, but M and H feel that something is suspicious after the Dyads indicated they were never working with The Hive. After their case file is found to be deleted, M, H, and C all begin to realize that T might be the actual mole in the organization, but they need to keep it on the low and stop whatever he has planned. M, H, and Pawny take a car-ship-vehicle out and head to find him.C tells the agents that a portal from The Hive has been opened in a nearby sector, in the Eiffel Tower. As they head to the site, M asks H how he and T first beat The Hive, but he only repeats the same exact phrase that has ever been used in describing the event (""with nothing but our wits and Series 7 de-atomizers""), leading them to realize that H was neuralyzed and that The Hive infected T before going into hiding and waiting for the right moment to strike back. They find T, who morphs into the Hive alien and attacks the agents. He takes the crystal and attempts to activate the weapon to destroy the planet. H attempts to reach into T's true human side, just as M gets knocked into the portal. Pawny jumps in and rescues her by pulling her back and flying with his jet pack. T appears to break through briefly, just moments before M gets her hands on the super weapon and sets it to the highest power, blasting the creature into goo and destroying The Hive's whole base.M and H are met by O, and they all mourn the loss of T. She then promotes M to a full time agent, and makes H the probationary director of the London branch.The two agents joined by Pawny head back to London before M goes back to New York."

Nothing even comes up on the John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Jack looks through his record collection and doesn't find a single Beatles album. He also discovers that, for some reason, the band Oasis doesn't exist either (and, as he later finds out, neither does Coca-Cola soda, cigarettes, and Harry Potter books and films in this strange alternate reality). He runs to Ellie's home in the pouring rain to ask if she really doesn't know who The Beatles are.Trapped in this alternate universe, Jack finds himself in a conundrum, as he remembers all the Beatles songs, but worries that he would be doing something wrong by making it sound like he wrote them despite getting away with it. Nevertheless, he makes notes and columns on every song of his that he knows all the lyrics to. He starts to write them down, with the hopes of having others hear it. He attempts to play ""Let It Be"" for his parents Jed (Sanjeev Bhaskar) and Sheila (Meera Syal), but Jack keeps getting interrupted when their annoying friend Terry (Karl Theobald) comes over and makes unsubtle quips about Jack's musical failures.After several unsuccessful shows with the Beatles songs, Jack gets the attention of a recording producer named Gavin (Alexander Arnold), who loves what he's heard. He invites Jack and Ellie to record some songs. Jack performs ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" with Ellie singing backup. He then records a few more songs, which start to get radio play. This gets the attention of none other than Ed Sheeran. He calls Jack, but he assumes it's a prank. Ed then shows up to the Malik house and personally speaks to Jack about being his opening act when he tours around the States. Jack is honored and he accepts. His friends later throw a party for him, but the mood is dampened when Ellie is in his room and sees she's featured on the column of ""good chums"" and not the column of love songs. Jack realizes Ellie admitted she's in love with him, but he tries his best to avoid discussing it any further by returning to the party.Jack joins Ed on their tour, accompanied by Rocky as a roadie. During one show in Moscow, a man, Leo (Justin Edwards), listens to Jack's music and has a bewildered look on his face before he goes home to look up Jack's album to see the songs he has.Jack and Ed spend a lot of time together, and Ed even challenges him to create a new song to play to an audience. Ed does his, and Jack sings ""The Long and Winding Road"". Ed admits that Jack is way better than he is, although Jack doesn't want to take that credit. After playing a couple more Beatles songs, Jack is approached by Ed's manager, Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon). She offers to sign Jack to her label, but is super blunt about how the label will acquire most of the money he makes, and also how Jack REALLY needs to change his doughy, unkempt appearance if he wants to maintain some kind of image.Jack's stardom rises quickly after signing under Debra. He and Rocky get chased through the streets by rabid fans, and his music becomes a worldwide phenomenon. However, Jack continues to feel pressure to put out as much Beatles material as he can. He even dreams that he is on James Corden's show and is confronted by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr over his plagiarism. He tries to record one of his own personal songs, ""Summer Song"" (a favorite among his friends), but Debra hates it.During a meeting with his marketing team, the head of the team (Lamorne Morris) addresses the titles of Jack's albums ('Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and 'The White Album'), since they are confusing to their audience, so they decide to call it ""One Man Only,"" implying that only Jack is responsible for the songs, which just makes him feel more guilty.Jack can't remember the lyrics to ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Penny Lane"", and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", so he and Rocky travel to Liverpool for inspiration by visiting the sites that the songs are named after. A woman named Liz (Sarah Lancashire) spots the two at the sites and watches them suspiciously.While in England, Jack is visited by Ellie. The two later go to his room and start to kiss, but Ellie feels awkward about it since they are giving in to their mutual feelings at the height of Jack's newfound fame and success. The next day, he tries to catch her as she heads back, right before he and Rocky need to return to L.A., and he finds her in a train station restaurant. Although Jack tries to talk to her, Ellie says that she has waited for too long for Jack to love her back. He joins Rocky on the trip back.Jack returns to keep performing. He later receives a call from Ellie, saying she has started seeing Gavin, and she wanted to let him know before he found out from someone else. She and Gavin, plus her and Jack's friends, all show up at a huge beach show to see him play ""Help!"", although Ellie sees that he's not just singing it. Later, Rocky tells Jack that he has two visitors. It's Leo and Liz. It turns out they are the only other two people besides Jack in this alternate universe who still remember The Beatles, but since they can't sing, they are thankful for keeping their music alive. Although they have a few criticisms, in particular, Jack forgetting some lyrics and also turning ""Hey Jude"" into ""Hey Dude"" (that's Ed and Debra's fault), they all agree that a world without The Beatles is worse off. Liz also helps Jack with one other thing.Jack takes an address from Liz and directed to the home of none other than the still-living John Lennon (Robert Carlyle). Since Lennon is not a musician/composer in this alternate world, he has been able to live to age 78 and had spent a lovely life with his wife Cynthia and their children. Jack asks if he wished things turned out differently, but John assures him that he had everything he needed, and that was enough for him. Jack asks to hug Lennon, and although he thinks he's a weirdo, he allows it.At Wembley, Jack performs another show, but he gets help from Ed and Rocky. He has them bring Ellie backstage at the end of the show, and they put the camera on her. In front of the whole audience, as well as Debra, Jack not only confesses his feelings for Ellie (which she hears), but also that the songs were written by a non=existent group called The Beatles. He no longer wants to take credit for the songs or receive any money for it, so he has Rocky upload all of the songs online for free. He leaves the stage to go meet with Ellie, who is stunned by what she heard. Gavin also heard it, but he isn't mad since he knew he wasn't going to match up to Jack (but he later ends up with Lucy). Fans, plus an enraged Debra, chase after Jack, but he flees with Ellie while Rocky holds everyone back. Jack and Ellie go home and make love for the first time.Later on, Jack is seen at a school teaching kids other Beatles songs, and they sing ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"". It is played over a montage of Jack and Ellie getting married and having a son and daughter. Even with his fame gone, Jack has found a greater success in his personal life.... as a school teacher."

One long decade after the post-apocalyptic events inZombieland (2009), the resilient quartet of survivors--the tough-as-nails zombie exterminator, Tallahassee; his rule-making comrade, Columbus; the free-spirited huntress, Wichita, and her younger sister, Little Rock--find themselves in the bosom of a now-derelict White House. However, in a rabid world still overrun by multitudes of walking dead and mutated strains of evolved animated corpses, a premeditated separation will send the team back to square one, searching, once more, for the promised land. Now, all hope rests on Babylon: an entirely organic commune of blissful vegetarian pacifists who love to party. Is this the end of the road?—Nick Riganas A decade after their first adventure, the zombie-bashing team of Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock move to the American heartland. Here, they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors, and the growing pains of their own makeshift family.—Carmen Ten years after the events of the first Zombieland movie, our heroes - Tallahassee, Wichita, Columbus and Little Rock - are enjoying life in the White House. Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.—grantss Ten years after the events of the first film, survivors Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) have become experts in identifying and disposing of various Zombies types (like Homer (Dumb Zombie), Hawking (Smart Zombie), Ninja (Silent and Deadly Zombie)). They move in to the abandoned White House. Columbus decides to propose to Wichita using the Hope Diamond, while Tallahassee rebuffs Little Rock's hopes of starting her own family. The next morning, Tallahassee finds a note from Wichita and Little Rock, who have left due to Little Rock feeling Tallahassee still treats her like a child and Wichita's fear she is too attached to Columbus.A month later, while exploring a mall, Columbus is startled by Madison, who has survived Zombieland alone since she was fourteen inside the freezer of a Pinkberry. Madison (Zoey Deutch) quickly annoys Tallahassee, but Columbus invites her back to the White House, where she has sex with him. Returning and discovering Columbus has slept with Madison, Wichita explains that Little Rock has left for Graceland with a pacifist musician Berkeley (Avan Jogia), and informs the group of more agile and durable ""super Zombies"". Fearing for Little Rock's safety, the group heads toward Graceland in a rundown minivan without any weapons. Tallahasse is enraged that Little rock is dating musician.. Wichita tells Tallahasse that he is over-bearing and is probably pushing Little-Rock away.On the road, the group tries to commandeer a luxury RV since Columbus has a strict ""no clown"" policy that prevents them from getting in an ice-cream truck. As they enter the RV the alarm goes off, and zombies attack. Methodically fighting back as a team, they encounter one of the super-zombies that takes multiple gunshots to kill, leading Columbus to nickname it the ""T-800"" after the Terminator franchise. Madison shows signs of ""Zombification"" after she is bit in the attack, forcing Columbus to lead her into the forest to shoot her. The group finds ""the Beast"", Tallahassee's modified presidential limousine stolen by Little Rock, at an Elvis-themed motel run by Nevada (Rosario Dawson), who reveals Little Rock took another vehicle toward Babylon, a hippie commune where no guns are allowed. Bonding over their love of Elvis, Nevada and Tallahassee spend the night together.The group awakens to find the Beast being crushed by a monster truck driven by Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), who strongly resemble Tallahassee and Columbus. Super zombies arrive, and Albuquerque explains they have turned back from their journey west due to hordes of super zombies moving east. Facing the super zombies alone, Albuquerque and Flagstaff are bitten, turn into zombies, and are both killed. Nevada talk about ""Murrayed"" which a term used for shooting somebody because you think they are a Zombie. Apparently that's how Bill Murray died.Heading out, the group finds Madison, alive and driving the clown themed ice-cream truck (her Zombification earlier was simply a nut allergy triggered by eating trail mix). Rejoining the group, she explains that her nut allergy caused symptoms similar to Zombification when Columbus spared her in the forest. The group arrives at Babylon, gives up their weapons, and find Little Rock. A satisfied Tallahassee departs (he is happy to see Little Rock safe and sound), only to find a horde of super zombies attracted by the commune's fireworks and runs back to warn the group. Left without guns, Tallahassee devises a plan to kill the zombies with exploding bio-diesel and then have commune members armed with barricade shields corral the stragglers off of a skyscraper with Tallahassee himself as the bait.The zombie horde is more massive than expected, and the group is surrounded and almost overwhelmed. Luckily, Nevada arrives in Albuquerque's monster truck, rescuing the group, although the vehicle soon rolls over. Escaping upstairs, the survivors corral the zombies off the roof. Tallahassee uses a construction crane hook to dangle just out of reach, but the last two zombies seize his leg as they fall, and Little Rock shoots them with a pistol given to her earlier by Tallahassee, rescuing him. The two reconcile, and Wichita accepts Columbus' proposal of marriage. Little Rock breaks up with Berkeley, who hooks up with Madison; they stay behind as the group, joined by Nevada, leave Babylon. Columbus remarks that they have finally found their home in each other.In a mid-credits scene, Bill Murray witnesses the start of the zombie outbreak ten years earlier while promoting a third Garfield film, before making his escape while killing multiple zombies. In a post-credits scene, Murray is shown earlier practicing coughing up a hairball as a joke in his interview."

It's 1968 in America. Change is blowing in the wind...but seemingly far removed from the unrest in the cities is the small town of Mill Valley where for generations, the shadow of the Bellows family has loomed large. It is in their mansion on the edge of town that Sarah, a young girl with horrible secrets, turned her tortured life into a series of scary stories, written in a book that has transcended time-stories that have a way of becoming all too real for a group of teenagers who discover Sarah's terrifying tomb.—Anonymous Urged to celebrate her last Halloween before graduation together with her friends, Chuck and Auggie, the smart high school student and aspiring horror author, Stella, reluctantly decides to take part in yet another uninteresting night of mischief, in 1968 Mill Valley, Pennsylvania. However--as one thing leads to another, and in the face of a serious threat--the bullied team of outcasts, along with the mysterious drifter, Ramón, will seek refuge in the town's allegedly haunted house: the infamous Bellows Mansion, home of the legendary, Sarah Bellows. Against the backdrop of hair-raising stories about pale ghosts, secret rooms, and horrible entities hiding in the thick shadows, the unsuspecting explorers of the unknown meander through the ill-lit manor's long corridors, only to unearth Sarah's old leather-bound book of blood-curdling tales.

They decide to spend the night visiting the haunted house of the Bellows family, where Stella finds the book of stories of the notorious Sarah Bellows. She brings the book home and soon she realizes that Sarah is writing one horror story per day with each one of them and she tries to find a means to stop Sarah.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set in 1968, it is Halloween in the town of Mill Valley. A young man named Ramon (Michael Garza) drives into town. Nearby, horror fan Stella Nicholls (Zoe Coletti) is called by her friends Chuck Steinberg (Austin Zajur) and Auggie Hilderbrandt (Gabriel Rush) to play a prank on school bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams). The jock and his buddies are throwing beer bottles at a neighborhood scarecrow called Harold (Mark Steger). Tommy also takes a swing at Harold with his bat.Chuck fishes poop out of the toilet and meets with his friends to throw it, plus eggs and toilet paper, at Tommy's car while he is out with Chuck's sister Ruthie (Natalie Ganzhorn) and his buddies. Tommy ends up driving his car back into a fence. He and his friends chase after the kids, who run to a drive-in theater and hide in Ramon's car. The bullies find them and threaten them into getting out, including Ramon. However, they are driven out of there by security, but not before Tommy makes a snide comment to Stella about her mom walking out on her and her father. After the jerks leave, Stella takes a breath outside before inviting Ramon to join her and the guys into checking out a haunted house.The four go to the home of Sarah Bellows, a figure in an old legend about a disturbed woman who allegedly poisoned numerous children in the neighborhood. The kids enter after Ramon picks the locks on the door. Auggie and Chuck mess around to scare each other, but Chuck ends up hiding in a closet where he sees the old room turn refurbished, and what appears to be an old woman with a dog sitting by the bed. Auggie opens the door to scare Chuck, and everything looks old again. Meanwhile, Stella and Ramon find Sarah's old book of scary stories. They are then trapped down there by Tommy and his goons. Ruth tells Tommy to let them out, but he locks her in there too. After trying to break out, an unseen force lets them free. They go outside to find that Ramon's car was vandalized by Tommy, with ""wetback"" written on it. Ramon must take it to the shop, and since he was living in his car, he has nowhere to go. Stella invites him to come over and stay in the basement.Tommy drives home drunk and is ordered by his mother to deliver eggs to the neighbors. On his way, he comes across Harold and taunts him again. At the same time, Stella reads from Sarah's book and sees the story ""Harold"" appearing. As she reads it, she notices that it mentions Tommy. He ends up walking in a circle and sees that Harold is no longer on his pike. Tommy soon realizes he is being followed by Harold. He trips across a rake and uses it to try and stop Harold, but the scarecrow takes it from him and impales Tommy with it. As Tommy tries running away, his body starts to fill up with straw.In the morning, Ramon brings his car to the shop, but he is pressed by Chief Turner (Gil Bellows) over his appearance in town. When he sees what Tommy wrote, Turner questions him over the supposed fight he got into with him. Ramon mentions his last name being Rodriguez, and Turner implies he will investigate him.Tommy is noted as being missing by Stella's father Roy (Dean Norris). She goes to investigate with Ramon, and they find what appears to be Harold wearing Tommy's clothes. Stella figures that this is Tommy and that the story she read came to life. She decides to take the book back to the Bellows house to prevent it from continuing.When Stella returns home with Ramon, he finds Sarah's book back on Stella's bookshelf. A new story then begins to appear, ""The Big Toe"". This one features Auggie's name, and it involves him eating a stew containing an appendage, and a disembodied voice calling out ""WHO TOOK MY TOE?"" Stella calls Auggie to warn him, but he ends up eating the stew, and the Big Toe woman (Javier Botet) starts stalking him. Auggie runs to hide in his room under his bed, but as he thinks he is safe, Big Toe pulls him under the bed and reveals her hideous face before making him disappear. Stella and Ramon show up too late and see the claw marks under Auggie's bed to have their fears confirmed.Stella tells Chuck and Ruth that Auggie is gone and that it's because of the book. Chuck suggests they take it to the police, but Ramon doesn't want to get involved with them since they might think he had something to do with both Auggie and Tommy disappearing, as there is now a search party going out for the latter. The trio try to burn the book, but it doesn't work.The friends go to the Mill Valley Gazette to dig up any old information on Sarah. They find articles about a woman named Lulu Baptiste, who worked for the Bellows family but was fired after Sarah hung herself, and it was believed that Lulu was teaching Sarah black magic. The book then starts to write another story, ""The Red Spot"". This one is about Ruthie, who got bitten by a spider while trapped in the Bellows house. She is set to go on stage for a performance of ""Bye Bye Birdie"", but the spider bite on her cheek starts to get worse. She goes to the bathroom to check on it, and hears a voice calling her name. A spider leg then pokes out of Ruth's cheek, before a whole swarm of spiders start crawling out and biting her. Stella, Chuck, and Ramon run to the school in time to catch Ruth and throw water on her to repel the spiders. She is covered in bites and crying to get the spiders off. She is later taken to the hospital.The friends track down the now elderly and blind Lulu (Lorraine Toussaint) to ask what happened with her and Sarah, hoping to find a way to undo what has been going on. She says there was no magic involved, but the presence of the book overwhelms Lulu.The trio then heads to a hospital that they think has records of the Bellows family. Chuck mentions having a dream about seeing a pale woman in a red room, telling him, ""This is an evil place. Run while you still can."" The kids sneak in and head to find whatever documents they can. Stella and Ramon come across a room with old recordings from Sarah as she received electroshock treatment from her brother Ephraim. They hear the voice of Sarah (Kathleen Pollard), who, as it turns out, was innocent and never poisoned the children, but it was her family's fault for tainting the water supply, and they tortured her and framed her to cover up their secrets. She then appears to be reciting the new story being written, ""The Dream."" Orderlies find Chuck as he snuck in, and the alarm goes off, making everything go red. He then sees the Pale Lady (also Mark Steger), who appears grotesquely overweight and has a horrifying grin etched on her face. No matter where Chuck runs, the Pale Lady keeps coming closer and closer until he cannot escape and she absorbs Chuck. Stella and Ramon find out too late that he is gone, and they are kicked out of the hospital.Stella calls her father from the precinct. She fears that she is going to die because of the book, and she tells him not to think that she is running away. Roy tells her to not think that it was ever her fault that her mother left. Turner then interrogates Stella and Ramon about the disappearances of their friends. They try to explain that it's because of the book, but it is too far-fetched for Turner to believe. He also brings up that Ramon's real last name is Morales and that he dodged the draft. The two are placed in adjacent cells, and Ramon explains that his brother was drafted to Vietnam and was killed out there, so he got away after learning he was to be drafted. Soon, the next story is being written, and a monster called the Jangly Man (Troy James) emerges. He breaks Turner's neck and tosses his body toward Stella's cell. She gets the keys, but the Jangly Man attempts to get Ramon since his name was in the book, and he knows of the Jangly man from an old story his father told him. Stella frees them both from the cell, and they realize they must run to the Bellows house to put an end to this. Jangly Man chases after them as they take Turner's car, but Ramon manages to lose him by crashing the car and pinning Jangly Man to a train.Stella and Ramon run to the Bellows house, where they get separated as Jangly Man goes for Ramon. Stella is pulled into another room by the ghosts of the Bellows family. She comes face-to-face with Sarah's ghost, who is getting ready to trap Stella in her own story. However, Stella hears Ramon's voice telling her to tell Sarah the truth. Stella stands up to the ghost and says that she knows that her family killed the children and framed her, but she is becoming as big of a monster as they were by haunting and taking her friends. Stella promises Sarah that she will tell the truth about her. Sarah gives Stella a quill and tells her to write Sarah's story in her own blood. Stella writes the truth, and Sarah's ghost wails before crossing over. The Jangly Man goes down as the terror appears to stop. Stella and Ramon run to embrace each other.Later on, Ramon willingly goes to be drafted in Vietnam. He says farewell to Stella, who gives him a letter and promises to write to him. He reads it on the bus, and it's a letter from her asking him to come home soon.Stella writes a story in the school paper about the truth over the Bellows family history. While not many people are listening, she is determined to let the real story be known. She then goes with Roy, and the recovered Ruth, as they plan to use Sarah's book to find a way to bring back Auggie and Chuck."

Walter tries to convince Sterling that there is another, more peaceful way to save the world but Sterling fires him before he could explain his latest invention: ""biodynamic concealment"".Later, Sterling discovers the briefcase to be empty and is confronted by Marcy Kappel, a security forces agent, who reveals footage of Sterling (actually Killian in a holographic disguise) leaving with the drone, labeling him as a traitor.

Dark Phoenix,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6565702/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Jean Grey begins to develop incredible powers that corrupt and turn her into a Dark Phoenix, causing the X-Men to decide if her life is worth more than all of humanity. The X-Men. Protectors of peace. Jean Grey is one of the most beloved X-Men. But when a mission goes wrong, Jean is exposed to a dark and ancient power. This power has destroyed everything it comes in contact with, until her. Now that this power is becoming unstable, she releases it with destruction and anger. Now that this foreign power is consuming her, and the world is threatened, the X-Men have to face an important truth: they must save either the world, or their friend who threatens it. After a car accident with her parents caused by her powers, the girl Jean Grey is raised by Professor Charles Xavier at his school. Years later, the X-Men are assigned to rescue a team of astronauts and Jean Grey is exposed to a dark and evil force. Soon her behavior changes affecting her friends and the future of the world.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Almost one long and peaceful decade after the nearly disastrous events inX-Men: Apocalypse (2016), Professor Charles Xavier's X-Men enjoy a mutually beneficial pact with the humans, undertaking increasingly dangerous missions as the Earth's valiant protectors. However, during a risky NASA crisis in 1992, Jean Grey is imbued with an unfathomable cosmic force--and even though she should be dead--this inexhaustible but uncontrollable energy enhances her already formidable abilities, transforming her into an all-powerful being. More and more, Jean's otherworldly powers become unpredictable and destructive, posing a direct threat not only to herself and her companions but also to the entire world. Is humankind prepared for the rise of the Dark Phoenix?—Nick Riganas In 1975, eight-year old Jean Grey accidentally causes a car accident, which claims the lives of her parents and leaves her as the sole survivor. Shortly after, she meets Charles Xavier, who brings her to the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters at the X-Mansion.In the present day of 1992, eight years after the attacks on Earth by Apocalypse, the X-Men are now seen as heroes across the world, adored as superheroes. After the space shuttle Endeavor is critically damaged by a supposed solar flare during an STS-49 mission, the President of the United States requests Professor X and the X-Men to save the astronauts. While the X-Men manage to save the space crew, Jean is stranded in deep space and absorbs the solar flare into her body. Nightcrawler brings her body back into the X-Jet, with Jean surviving the event and her psychic powers greatly amplified as a result. However, they become uncontrollable and she accidentally unleashes her power on her fellow mutants at the X-Mansion, injuring her boyfriend Cyclops in the process.Xavier reveals that he had placed mental barriers within Jean's mind to block out the trauma of the car accident; additionally, he had lied about both of her parents' dying in the accident, as it turns out her father, John Grey, is still alive. Jean leaves the X-Mansion and returns to her family home, where she encounters her family. However, she notices that there are only photos of her mother in the house, and questions her father as to why he never looked for her following the accident.After Jean informs him that she can read minds, John intentionally recalls the entire incident mentally so that Jean could see, and it is shown that Jean rendered her mother unconscious while driving, thereby killing her. As John considered his wife the most important person in his world, he resented Jean for causing his wife's death and, upon meeting Xavier, had given her custody of Jean.The X-Jet then arrives on the street and the X-Men corner Jean, who retaliates, injuring Quicksilver and killing Mystique in the process. Jean also attacks police officers, prompting public reception towards her and mutants in general to become sour. Jean then travels to Genosha, a mutant safe haven run by Magneto, and asks him for help to prevent herself from killing more people.However, he orders her to leave after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Around this time, a shape-shifting alien race known as the D'Bari arrive on Earth with the purpose of harnessing the cosmic flare inside Jean in order to conquer Earth. Vuk, the leader of the D'Bari, encounters Jean and explains to her that what she absorbed was not a solar flare but in fact a cosmic energy entity that was responsible for eradicating the D'Bari home planet years ago. The power had consumed all those it came across with the exception of Jean.Back at the X-Mansion, Beast blames Xavier for Raven's death. Defecting from the X-Men, he flees the X-Mansion using the X-Jet and flies to Genosha, informing Magneto that Jean had murdered Mystique. He then joins Magneto, Ariki and Selene in traveling to New York City in order to assassinate Jean and avenge Mystique. Using Cerebro, Xavier realizes what their goal is and recruits Cyclops, Storm and Nightcrawler to save Jean's life. During the battle, both Magneto and Professor X encounter Jean, although Magneto is knocked out while Professor X is forced to walk without his wheelchair.While Xavier can no longer read Jean's mind, she can read his, and he shows her the memory he had with his father, where he expressed support and hope for Jean. The memory reasserts Jean's original personality, and she spares Xavier. She is then tempted by Vuk to transfer the cosmic energy to her; while Vuk is able to absorb some of it, she is struck by Cyclops before the transfer is completed. The military then intervenes, using collars that disable mutant powers to apprehend Professor X, Jean, Magneto, Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Ariki and Selene, while Vuk manages to escape.While on the train, one of the soldiers berates Nightcrawler, informing him that his son adored him prior to their actions. Meanwhile, Xavier informs Beast that he was wrong for what he had done to Jean, but that the real Jean still exists within; Cyclops also tells Beast and Magneto that Mystique had died believing that, and that she wouldn't have wanted them to kill Jean.The train is then attacked by Vuk and the D'Bari, who easily overpower the soldiers. Nightcrawler convinces the soldier whose son had idolized them to free them, and he does so; the X-Men and Magneto's faction proceed to team up to attack the D'Bari, although they are unable to defeat Vuk, who subdues them all.Xavier apologizes to Jean for what he had done, explaining that he just wished to give her what he deserved every child deserved - love and family. Jean then frees herself from her restraints, declaring that she would protect her family. Jean shields Magneto and her fellow X-Men while destroying the train they are on. She then swiftly disintegrates the remaining D'Bari forces before being attacked by Vuk, who begins to absorb Jean's remaining cosmic power.As Jean attempts to use the power to eliminate Vuk as well, she realizes that Cyclops is beginning to disintegrate as well. Knowing that she cannot unleash her energy on Earth without harming innocents, Jean takes a hold of Vuk and flies into space, where she reabsorbs the cosmic energy and explodes, killing Vuk and seemingly herself as well.The remaining X-Men return to New York, where the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is renamed the Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters. Xavier retires from his position as Headmaster, granting the dean to Beast, and moves to Paris, France, where he encounters Magneto, who requests they play a game of chess and offers him a home, just as Xavier had done for him before.As two start playing a flaming phoenix appears high in the sky..."
Terminator: Dark Fate,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6450804/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An augmented human and Sarah Connor must stop an advanced liquid Terminator from hunting down a young girl, whose fate is critical to the human race. A young female Mexican worker, Dani Ramos, is hunted down by a virtually indestructible terminator from the future called a REV-9. However, she is protected by an enhanced human named Grace who is also from the future. They flee from the unstoppable terminator and, out of the blue, Sarah Connor helps them on the road. All three head to Laredo, Texas, where Grace has the coordinates of a possible support and where they meet a T-800 who is living in an isolated location with his family. The group teams up to try to destroy the REV-9.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Exactly twenty-five years after the elimination of Skynet's nuclear threat inTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), another seemingly unimportant human--this time, the unsuspecting car assembly worker, Dani Ramos--sets in motion a murderous plan against humankind, devised by the tyrannical machines from the future. Once more, the self-aware computer system sends back in time its most sophisticated android assassin--the nearly indestructible terminator made of advanced mimetic poly-alloy, Rev-9--to exterminate young Dani in 2020 Mexico City. However, from the distant 2042, a fearless protector arrives--the bionically enhanced Resistance fighter, Grace--who, to ensure Dani's survival, reluctantly joins forces with an unexpected ally, and a battle-tested defender from the past: the armed-to-the-teeth, Sarah Connor. With Sarah's sacrifice, the world never had to face the aftermath of Judgment Day. Can the trio of guardians rewrite history, again?—Nick Riganas Following the events of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) felt that her nightmares of a machine-ravaged future world were long gone. Those feelings changed when on a beach in Guatemala in 1998, she watched in horror as her son John (Jude Collie) was murdered by a T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), shattering her world once again.22 years later in Mexico, a couple watches as a glowing ball of light drops a naked woman not far from them. The young woman (named Grace (Mackenzie Davis)), seems to be unconscious, but before they can try and get her medical attention, local authorities arrive, making assumptions on the situation. As they try to apprehend Grace, she wakes up and in a surprising display of speed and skill, disables the officers! She then steals the clothes from the boyfriend, and his car before heading into the city.The next day, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) wakes up her brother Diego (Diego Boneta), and greets her father Vicente (Enrique Arce), before she and Diego head off to work at a local automobile factory. Shortly after they leave, a glowing ball of light appears, and drops a new Terminator known as a REV-9 (Gabriel Luna) into the apartment complex where the Ramos family lives.When Dani and Diego arrive for work, they are surprised to see that a machine has taken over Diego's job. Dani goes to speak to the manager, showing her disgust that the factory is more concerned with automation than humanity. Dani tries to get the manager to consider keeping Diego instead of her, before returning to the factory floor. Heading towards Diego, she is surprised to see her father there, when suddenly, the sound of bullets are heard, and her father's body crumples to the floor as Grace attacks! Dani is shocked at the brutal attack on her father, before Grace grabs her, and Diego follows! As they run, the REV-9 morphs out of his Vicente disguise and gives chase. Grace attempts to fend off the attacks, but is helped when Diego drops a car engine on it!This buys the group some time to escape in a truck, but not before the REV-9 gives chase in a bigger truck, leading to a chase onto the nearby freeway. The chase leads to the truck the group is in to crash, with Diego being impaled by metal bars. Dani does not want to leave her brother, but is pulled away in time as the REV-9 crashes a vehicle into the truck, destroying it and Diego!The Terminator has now split into two formidable foes, one a metal endo-skeleton, and the other made of liquid metal. As Grace prepares for a last stand, an SUV skids to a stop, and out comes Sarah, wielding weaponry that incapacitates both of the REV-9's forms. As Sarah examines her handiwork, Grace and Dani jump into Sarah's SUV and drive off.Some distance away, Grace's body begins to shut down due to the energy she expended in trying to fend off the REV-9. Dani claims they should go to the Police, but Grace claims that will only lead to the REV-9 finding them faster. Dani then takes Grace to a pharmacy, where Grace grabs a number of medicines, before collapsing on the way out. However, Dani is surprised to find Sarah outside, having tracked them down! She explains that both Diego and Vicente are dead, before tossing Dani's phone out the window, claiming that it can aid the new Terminator in tracking them down.Taking them to a motel, Sarah gives the unconscious Grace the medicines she needs. When Grace awakes, she and Sarah come to blows, before explaining their stories. Sarah tells how she claimed to have stopped Skynet from creating Judgment Day but lost her son John, leading to her hunting down Terminators.Grace explains that she came from the year 2042, but instead of Skynet, the threat against humanity came from something called Legion. When Sarah claims she seems ""almost human,"" Grace explains that she is human, but has just been enhanced to fight the machines.Leaving the motel, the group are unsure where to go. When Grace inquires how Sarah knew where to find them, she tells that it is from an unknown source. This source sends Sarah coordinates that show where a Terminator will show up, and each text includes the words, ""For John."" Grace manages to use her enhanced cybernetics to hack into the phone, and finds that the texts originate from Laredo, Texas. Dani directs them to head to her Uncle, who can get them across the border, feeling that whomever is sending the messages may be able to help them.Meanwhile, the REV-9 has infiltrated a surveillance system, and begins trying to track them down.The three women manage to hop aboard a train, to get to Dani's Uncle. On the trip, Dani asks Grace more about the future. Grace explains it took only three days to bring the world to it's knees. She lost her parents, but was saved by those fighting back against the machines, before volunteering to come back in time to protect Dani. Sarah then claims she knows why: with John now out of the picture, Dani is the ""new Sarah,"" and will surely give birth to the savior of the future.The three soon meet Dani's uncle Felipe (Tristan Ulloa). As he and his associates help to get them across the border, the REV-9 is tracking their progress, and sends a false statement to US Border Patrol, claiming the group are hostiles. When they emerge from under a hole in the border wall, government agents are waiting for them. As they are taken away, the REV-9 attempts to down a drone and kill Dani, but not before Grace manages to save her, but ends up badly injured.After they are taken to a facility, the three women are split up. Dani is put in a cage with other detainees, while Sarah is detained elsewhere because of her criminal record. Medical staff are surprised at what they find when examining Grace, before she awakens and takes the group out. As Grace makes her way to rescue Dani she finds the REV-9 has infiltrated the facility!Grace manages to get Dani to a Helicopter, but Dani doesn't want to leave Sarah behind. Sarah manages to find the two and escape, but not before the REV-9 almost gets her! Grace chastises Dani for putting herself at risk, claiming she's ""too important"" to be doing that.The three fly to Laredo, where they find the source of Sarah's secret text messages...which are being sent to her by the same T-800 who killed John! Sarah's first impulse is to kill the thing, but not before Grace and Dani stop her. The T-800 claims that after he killed John, he remained without a purpose until he adapted to life as a human. Adopting the name of Carl, he formed a relationship with a woman and her son. This soon caused him to think of Sarah, and given he could sense when the time-flow was disrupted by Terminators being sent back in time, sent her the text messages to give her life purpose.Knowing the REV-9 is still after Dani, the group are unsure what to do to protect her. Dani however, claims she does not want to just be protected, and wants to fight. The group then go about trying to get her acclimated to using weapons. They also feel that the blast from an EMP could disable the REV-9, and Sarah reaches out to a Military contact.The group heads off to meet Sarah's contact, but the REV-9 is not far behind. Chasing them onto a military base, Sarah's contact manages to get them the EMP, and secures them transport on a heavy aircraft. It is here that Grace reveals the rest of her story, and why Dani is so important. It turns out that when Grace was a child, it was Dani who saved her, and united a number of humans in the resistance that fought back against the machines.The REV-9 manages to catch up with the group, and a fight ensues, wherein the plane is severely damaged, and the group plummets down near the raging waters of a hydro-electric plant.With their weaponry largely gone and the EMP having been damaged, the group attempt to fight against the REV-9 with all they have left. Carl and Grace manage to shove the REV-9 into the spinning blades of a nearby turbine, the friction causing it to explode in a massive fireball, severely damaging the facility, as well as Grace, Carl, and the REV-9.In the aftermath, the REV-9's liquid metal shell is deactivated, but it's endo-skeleton is still functional. Grace is also dying from her wounds, and begs Dani to use her internal power source, which should be enough to fry the REV-9. Though it pains Dani to do so, she retrieves the power source as Grace expires, before trying to take on the REV-9 herself. The battle appears to be lost, until Sarah yells for Carl to do something. He manages to take the power source, and pulls the REV-9 and himself down into the destroyed turbine core. At the bottom of the core, Grace's power source fries the REV9's circuits, and disintegrates the clothing and flesh on Carl. As he lays eyes one final time on Sarah and Dani watching him, he utters two words: ""for John.""Following these events, Sarah and Dani find Grace in the present day, happily playing among a number of other children. While things seem safe, it is still possible that more Terminators (powered by Legion) may still be sent back. This time, Dani intends to stay by Sarah's side, to help her...and hope that Judgment Day may never come for them."

A yeti (voice of Joseph Izzo) escapes from his holding cell and proceeds to run from the building. Dr. Zara (voice of Sarah Paulson) and the mercenary captain (voice of Rich Dietl) chase after the yeti, but he manages to break out. Once outside, he hums, which triggers his powers that allow him to burst through the gate and run into the city. The yeti manages to find a place to hide, but he becomes sad when he sees a billboard for Mount Everest.Teenager Yi (voice of Chloe Bennet) lives with her mother (voice of Michelle Wong) and her Nai Nai (voice of Tsai Chin). It has been a while since Yi's father passed, and she hasn't been as close to her mom or Nai Nai because of it. She takes on several odd jobs (dog-walking, babysitting, garbage removal, etc) to save up money to take a trip across China that she wanted to take with her dad. Her childhood friend Jin (voice of Tenzing Norgay Trainor) is more concerned with his social life, and Jin's cousin Peng (voice of Albert Tsai) doesn't have other friends to play with. Yi also keeps a violin that belonged to her father and still plays it every now and then. While on the roof, she starts to play as she looks over the city, but a helicopter searching for the yeti comes by and knocks Yi off her feet, causing the bow to slide to where the yeti is resting. Yi freaks out when she sees him, but when she sees that he is scared and injured, she realizes that he is not harmful.Mr. Burnish (voice of Eddie Izzard) is angry that his yeti has gone missing, as he was hoping to unveil the creature before a special presentation. Zara promises to find the yeti and bring it back safely.The next day, Yi gets some of Nai Nai's pork buns and brings them to the yeti, who devours all of them in one gulp. Yi then runs to the pharmacy to get supplies to tend to the yeti's wound. She spots Zara, the Captain, and the other mercenaries running around trying to look for the yeti, so she hides before going to help the yeti. Yi then notices that the yeti keeps looking at the Everest billboard. Realizing that he wants to go home to his mountain, Yi decides to name him Everest.Later, Yi brings her violin out to play some music for Everest. He hums again, causing his magic to bring a wilted flower back to life. Jin and Peng go to the roof to look for Yi and find Everest playing with her, but from Jin's perspective, it looks like Everest is eating her. He calls the cops, which Zara and the mercs overhear on the scanner. Soon, the mercs fly toward the roof and spot Everest. Yi helps him get away, with Jin and Peng following. Yi and Everest make it to the top of another building with the mercs cornering them, but they are saved by the building's lights going off as they do every night. This gives Yi and Everest a chance to make it to the docks where Everest hops on a boat to go back home. Seeing how frightened he is, Yi hops on the boat to join him. Peng runs after them and is caught by Everest, while Jin reluctantly joins to protect Peng. He tells his mom he took Yi and Peng to Beijing for a college tour.Everest and the kids end up in a crate of sodas as the boat stops at an island. Their crate gets on a truck, but they all fall off of it after Peng and Everest get too hopped up on soda. This leads to them having to walk to the mountain to get Everest home. Jin complains because he is hungry, and Everest hums again to cause some blueberries to grow. However, they start to grow to humongous sizes before they start flying and hitting the kids as they try to run away. They end up resting for the night, with Yi noticing that Peng and Everest get along so well because Everest is basically a child who misses his family. Jin makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about Yi becoming distant from her mom and Nai Nai after her father passed, which upsets her.Burnish, Zara, the Captain, and the other mercs make it to the island, and they follow the trail of soda cans until they have a lead as to where they may find Everest. Burnish, not having stepped out of the comfort of his home and company for so long, begins to admire nature.The gang starts making their way further, only for Burnish's drones to spot them. Everest causes a dandelion to grow big enough to float them away, but Jin fails to jump after them and plans to meet the others in a village by the river. Jin is found by Burnish and his team, and they allow him to stay with them at their camp.Yi, Everest, and Peng land their dandelion in the desert, leaving a family of turtles with plenty of food. They stop to rest again, but Yi feels that this whole mess is her fault. They then notice fish swimming upstream in the river, and Yi tells Peng that these fish don't give up, and so they don't have to give up either. They proceed to keep moving.Jin can't sleep and he begins to walk outside. He overhears Zara talking to the Captain. She drops her British accent and reveals that she never cared to bring Everest home safely, but rather to profit off of his existence, and she doesn't care if she has to hurt the children to get him back. Jin tries to steal a motorcycle, but it rides off a cliff from under him. He ends up walking and going through treacherous terrain until he finally finds a vendor that gives him a boat in exchange for his phone.The other three board a train that takes them to the village. Yi and Peng try to sneak Everest through the crowd with the other yaks, but Burnish and his team have spotted them. Jin arrives in time to get Yi on the boat, while Peng causes the yaks to stampede and create a diversion. He and Everest join Yi and Jin, but the Captain turns the van with him, Burnish, and Zara inside into a water vehicle. They chase after the heroes, so Everest removes the boat engine and hums to send the boat sailing further. They hit the land, but Everest's magic causes the field of flowers to create a tidal wave that pushes them to safety. Even Burnish is amazed at this power.The gang crashes their boat on another island. Yi's violin is broken, and she runs into the forest. Jin follows her and asks if she is okay. She expresses her whole problem with her father's passing, and her distance from her mom and Nai Nai. Yi even admits that she hasn't cried over her dad's death yet. When they get back to Peng and Everest, they find that the two helped fix Yi's violin by using Everest's hair as strings, giving the violin magic powers. Yi then looks at the pictures she had saved in her case of all the places she wanted to visit with her father. It turns out all the places they have just been to in their adventure WERE all those places, but there is one place that she hasn't seen yet. The gang moves forward until they reach the Sichuan Buddha statue. Yi becomes emotional and starts to play ""Fix You"" (as her father did) on the violin. The magic from Everest's hairs causes the statue to become covered in flowers.As the heroes near the mountain, they are found by the mercenaries on a bridge. Everest runs to the top of the bridge and uses his magic to protect the kids. Burnish sees this and has a flashback to when he first saw yetis. He saw the mother yeti protecting her children, and he knew they were good creatures. He tells Zara that they have to bring Everest in safely. Instead, Zara tells the Captain to tranquilize Burnish. She then has the other mercs tranquilize Everest, causing him to fall to the bridge. Zara tries to use a cattle prod on him, but Yi attempts to fight her off. Zara ends up pushing Yi over the bridge, which Jin and Peng witness as Zara takes them as her prisoners. They board Everest in a cage and start to head out.Yi holds onto a rope on the bridge. She pulls herself back up to the top and grabs her violin. She plays it to use the magic to revive Everest. He bursts out of the cage, stopping the mercs in their path. Yi runs over there as Everest frees Jin, Peng, and Burnish. He uses his powers to create large icicles that scare off the mercenaries. However, Zara and the Captain are now determined to take Everest in, dead. She rams the van into Everest, hitting the side of a mountain. This causes an avalanche that sends Zara and the Captain falling to their deaths. Everest is unharmed. Burnish tells Everest that he is an amazing creature, which is why the world must never know that he exists. He proposes to take the kids home, but Yi says she promised to bring Everest home first.Everest uses his magic to create flying cloud creatures that guide everyone to the mountain. There, they find enormous yetis that are Everest's family. He runs into their arms, and his parents respectfully nod to Yi in gratitude. The kids bid their friend farewell.Burnish takes the kids home. Yi runs to hug her mom and Nai Nai. They later have dinner together, with Jin and Peng coming over. Peng brings in a box left to them from Burnish, with equipment for their next adventure. They then sit to have Nai Nai's pork buns, which Peng claims to love more than anyone. Yi says she knows someone else who loved them just as much. As the family eats, the last thing we hear is Everest humming."

Six strangers are given mysterious black boxes with tickets to an immersive escape room for a chance to win tons of money. Being locked in several rooms with extreme conditions, they discover the secrets behind the escape room and must fight to survive and to find a way out. Six strangers meet together in a room with the same choice, to escape a room and win ten thousand dollars. But when a death of a young gamer happens they try to find the truth behind the rooms. And their only hope to survival is to escape the rooms and try not to die by a company's trick.—alyfarrag-32653 Having received a mysterious invitation to try their luck at solving intricate puzzles and breaking out of a booby-trapped escape room to win $10,000, six perfect strangers find themselves in a large waiting room. Intrigued, the unsuspecting young contestants get to work, only to discover that the extreme, well-thought-out dangers lurking in the elaborately constructed chambers are real. But now there is no turning back, and the thrill-seekers are inside a deadly game of survival. Can the players find the scattered clues to prevent the inevitable?—Nick Riganas A man (Logan Miller) is seen trying to escape a collapsing room by solving a puzzle.Three days prior, shy physics student Zoey (Taylor Russell) attends a lecture on the Quantum Zeno Effect theory, which states ""a system cannot change while you are watching it."" Her professor challenges her to take a risk over the Thanksgiving break.Ben (Logan Miller), seen earlier in the collapsing room, is a stock boy at a grocery store with a smoking habit frustrated at his boss' refusal to promote him to a better role and higher salary.Jason (Jay Ellis) is a young stockbroker respected among his co-workers for his fast-paced and go-getter lifestyle.Zoey, Ben, and Jason are all gifted a puzzle box addressed from a trusted acquaintance: Zoey's professor, Ben's boss, and Jason's client. After solving the puzzle, a clue invites them to the Minos Escape Room for a chance at $10,000 should they successfully escape.War veteran Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll), former miner Mike (Tyler Labine), and escape-room enthusiast Danny (Nik Dodani) arrive and join Zoey, Ben, and Jason in what appears to be a waiting area. When Ben tries leaving the room to smoke, the door handle breaks off, locking the inside and revealing an oven temperature gauge.After Mike finds a copy of Fahrenheit 451, Zoey sets the temperature to 451°F. Embedded heat panels progressively turn on bringing the room to increasingly hot temperatures, causing panic among all except Danny who refuses to believe the heat is authentic. Zoey notices Amanda's uneasiness and tries to calm her with water from the water cooler. The group receive a phone-call advising them to follow posted rules.Zoey sees a sign asking for coasters to be used for drinks and the group notice an escape vent to the next room opens when they simultaneously push down on six coasters. Jason escapes first, followed by Mike and Amanda while Zoey realizes filling a glass with water will hold down a coaster long enough for her to escape the room. Ben and Danny rush to cover all coasters with glasses until not enough water remains since Amanda drank a glass earlier. Ben empties his flask into the final glass and the two escape just in time as the room engulfs in flames.In a mountain cabin, the group, barring Danny, grow concerned at how real the game is becoming. The cameras in each room do nothing when the group needs help. Jason seeks a seven-lettered name connected to ""You'll Go Down in History"" to unlock the cabin door. Ben has a flashback where he was driving with friends singing ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" just before a head-on collision. Ben gives RUDOLPH as the code and the group exit and enter frigid temperatures on a frozen stream just as the cabin doors and windows lock shut. Searching their surroundings, Jason locates a door needing a key and the others find a compass, fishing rod, magnet, and ice fishing hole. Jason grows concerned when he recognizes a red parka the group find and take turns wearing to stay warm.The group fish out a key encased in a cube of ice. Danny attempts to retrieve Ben's lighter to melt the cube but falls into the ice with the lighter and drowns. The group are distraught at the loss of Danny and alarmed at how calculated his death was, noting he fell into the ice when he grabbed the lighter. Fearing hypothermia, Jason convinces the group to huddle and use their collective body heat to melt the ice. Once they retrieve the key Jason manages to turn the lock, but the door does not open. The group escape across the stream into a new door that opens just as all the remaining ice collapses beneath them.The third room is an inverted bar with pool tables. As the group enter, they feel the entire room elevate to a new altitude. They notice a door without a doorknob; Mike thinks the eight-ball missing from the pool table must be the doorknob hidden somewhere in the bar. A telephone cord drops from the ceiling and the call warns the group to watch their steps. Music begins to play followed by an ear-piercing dial-up sound. Each time the sequence is repeated, a portion of the floor falls away. Amanda climbs up the wall behind the bar and finds a safe with a four-digit code. The group find the numbers they need in a sliding tile puzzle solved by Zoey but cannot open the safe.Zoey briefly falls unconscious and has a flashback to a plane crash where she was the lone survivor left upside down while everyone was strapped to their seat. All pieces of the floor fall and Mike, Ben, Jason, and Zoey congregate near the exit. Zoey tells Amanda to enter the numbers inverted and in reverse to replicate the room conditions. Amanda successfully unlocks the eight-ball but cannot safely climb across to join the group. Sacrificing herself, Amanda manages to throw the eight-ball to Jason just as she plummets to her death.The group enter a hospital ward containing beds identical to ones each of the game's players were treated in after being declared as sole survivors: Zoey survived a plane crash, Mike was the only miner pulled alive after a cave-in, all of Ben's friends were killed after he drove drunk, and only Jason was found by the Coast Guard after he and his college roommate's boat overturned in frigid waters. The group learn Danny's entire family was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and Amanda was the only soldier in her unit to survive an IED blast in Iraq. The remaining survivors realize deliberate planning led to them all arriving at the escape room-to see who would be the luckiest out of the lucky-and aspects of the game have been modeled on their lives.A TV broadcast states the group has five minutes to live unless they put their heart into it; when time is up, the room will be filled with poison gas. Jason, Ben, and Mike locate an EKG machine to find the optimal heart rate that will lead to the next room. Zoey, wanting to outsmart the game-makers, employs the thinking of the Quantum Zeno Effect and disables all the cameras in the room with the hope of finding a way out. Believing a high heart rate will save the group, Jason inadvertently kills Mike by blasting him several times with a defibrillator. Once poisonous gas begins to leak into the room, Jason hooks himself up to the EKG and lets the poison lower his rate to below 50 BPM. The pathway to the next room opens and Jason and Ben escape, but Zoey refuses to follow along, purportedly collapsing and dying after disabling the final camera.Jason and Ben enter the fifth room with walls and furniture decorated by optical illusions. Enraged at how Jason callously killed Mike and did not bother helping Zoey, Ben feels Jason was not a sole survivor by choice. Given his behavior in the game, Ben guilts Jason into admitting he deliberately killed his roommate at sea for himself to survive using the red parka. When opening a hatch leading to the next room, Jason and Ben are contaminated by a hallucinogenic substance. Ben finds the antidote injection intended for one recipient and the two fight to the death. Jason breaks Ben's leg but is killed on impact when Ben kicks him into a table corner. Ben escapes into the final room.The final room returns to the opening sequence of events in the film. Ben manages to contain the flames in the fireplace and use it as a crawlspace to avoid being crushed. He emerges in the final space and is greeted by the Gamemaster, who designs the escape rooms. The Gamemaster explains the purpose of the game, revealing a connecting theme picks the competitors (i.e. college athletes, lone survivors, etc.) followed by individuals betting on winners. Ben hopes he may now leave having won, but the Gamemaster tries to kill Ben to stop the secrets of the game from being revealed.Zoey manages to have survived by taking an oxygen mask from the hospital bed and connecting its tubing through one of the openings created by the disabled cameras. Feigning death when two cleaners enter Room #4 to remove evidence, Zoey incapacitates them and flees. Zoey manages to save Ben before both kill the Gamemaster and escape.Ben and Zoey are treated for injuries but all the evidence at the escape room facility is erased by the time Zoey arrives with investigators. Six months later, Zoey convinces Ben to join her on a flight to the Minos Escape Room HQ in New York after she pinpoints their geographic coordinates from their logo. Unbeknownst to them, the game's architect is already one step ahead and planning to trap Zoey and Ben into another game by turning their flight into a simulated escape with a 4% chance at survival."
Midway,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6924650/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of the Battle of Midway, told by the leaders and the sailors who fought it. MIDWAY centers on the Battle of Midway, a clash between the American fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy which marked a pivotal turning point in the Pacific Theater during WWII. The film, based on the real-life events of this heroic feat, tells the story of the leaders and soldiers who used their instincts, fortitude and bravery to overcome the odds. In May 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launches an attack on the island of Midway in the Pacific Ocean. Securing it will provide a base for operations against Pearl Harbour and ultimately allow them to attack the US west coast. However, US Navy Intelligence has worked out their plan. Admiral Chester Nimitz sends two US Task Groups with three aircraft carriers to set a trap for the Japanese fleet. What follows is one of the most important battles in history.—grantss Kyoto, Japan, 1937Lieutenant Commander Edwin T. Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokama) following a dinner with the Japanese navy. Yamamoto tells Layton how Japan is eager to become a world power on the same level as the U.S. and China, but the U.S. only sends a limited amount of oil. He promises to Layton that if their supplies are compromised, the Japanese will be forced to take drastic measures.Four years later on December 7, 1941, World War II is raging on, with Japan having invaded China and Hitler taking over Europe. The U.S. has remained neutral up until this point. Just over a thousand miles of Pearl Harbor, pilot Dick Best (Ed Skrein) is flying during a routine exercise with other pilots, ending with a rocky landing aboard the USS Enterprise. He must stay behind and work with his superior officer, Wade McClusky (Luke Evans).On the USS Arizona, Lt. Roy Pearce (Alexander Ludwig) is setting up for church with the rookies. Moments later, Japanese airships fly in and begin to fire upon Pearl Harbor. Ships are bombed and pilots are shot out of the sky. Best's wife Ann (Mandy Moore) and daughter Barbara (Madison Roukema) notice the attack from their backyard. Layton is alerted to the attack and joins his fellow officers. Pearce helps the young men move across to a safer boat while he stays behind and tries to fight back. McClusky gathers his men to prepare themselves for battle, now that the U.S. is officially part of WWII. Just then the Arizona explodes from several hits by Japanese planes, killing nearly everyone on board.After the attack is over, bodies are recovered from the water. Best goes to identify Pearce's body, as he was his roommate and old friend. With Pearce's body burnt beyond recognition, Best can only identify him with a class ring. Later, Best joins his fellow soldiers at a bar to toast to Pearce's memory. Meanwhile, Layton reports to Admiral Kimmel that while the attack did serious damage, it could have been worse. Namely, the base's fuel oil storage facilities were untouched: had they been attacked and destroyed, that loss could have crippled the US Pacific fleet by itself by eliminating its main refuelling facility in the middle of Pacific Ocean and forced to its retreat to the West Coast of the United States.In Japan, Yamamoto becomes aware that the attack has provoked the U.S. He meets with Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano), having hoped that Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimara) would destroy the U.S. oil tank farms, , but the men proceed to work on their next move, which is to go after the U.S. air carriers.Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) arrives in Washington to be assigned as the new commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which took a major hit with the Pearl Harbor attack. He later meets Layton, discussing the latter's failure to warn his superiors in time prior to the attack. Nimitz is firm that he will help lead the men in their next fight, starting by sending them to invade the Marshall Islands.McClusky's men fly into the Islands, while William ""Bull"" Halsey's (Dennis Quaid) men take on the Japanese from the seas. A fight ensues, with U.S. pilots firing upon Japanese ships. A machinist named Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas) manages to successfully shoot down a Japanese plane into the ocean, which gets him promoted by Halsey.Later on, Lt. Colonel James Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) arrives as the men are heading to Japan to provide bomber planes with the intent of striking Tokyo. They begin their air raids across Japan. Doolittle ends up in Japanese-occupied territory in China. After some convincing that he is an American military pilot, the Chinese civilians and guerillas congratulate him for striking a blow against Japan. Japanese planes fire upon the village where Doolittle is, killing a number of civilians. Meanwhile, Admiral Yamamoto is despondent at allowing such a brazen attack, but his spirits are lifted upon learning that the incident has convinced the alarmed Japanese government to agree to his plan to take Midway.Layton informs Nimitz that crypt-analyst Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) has picked up a message that indicates the Japanese are moving toward the Coral Sea, targeting something referred to as ""AF"". The Americans make their move in that direction as well. Halsey promotes McClusky to lead the pilots while Best is promoted to skipper. Layton thinks that, contrary to Washington's belief on the Japanese are targeting a location in the South Pacific, Layton thinks ""AF"" is code for Midway, and they are planning to attack there in a matter of weeks. Layton brings Nimitz to personally meet with Rochefort to back up their claims. Nimitz orders them to try and convince Washington with this information. To do, Layton secretly arranges the Midway base to broadcast an uncoded radio message saying their water treatment systems have malfunctioned. Sure enough, Layton's codebreakers intercept a Japanese coded message saying AF is having water problems, and Layton cheerfully passes that clear confirmation of Japan's target to Nimitz.Best begins training the rookies to fly. As it happens, the conditions for takeoffs from the carrier prove dangerously poor and he is barely able to ascend into the air. Unfortunately, Best's warning to abort more sorties until the carrier is repositioned come too late and another pilot lands in the water, getting killed when the ship sails over the plane despite the helm's best efforts to avoid it. Best expresses his woes and doubts to Ann later that night.Nimitz orders USS Hornet and Enterprise out of the Coral Sea and demands that Yorktown, which has been greatly damaged, be readied for the battle within 72 hours. The men continue to prepare and train themselves, all while dreading the battle that lies ahead. However, the arrival of the USS Yorktown lifts their spirits for the action ahead.On the morning of June 4, 1942 the Japanese launch their air attack on Midway. Director John Ford (Geoffrey Blake) runs around the scene with his crew to get some great footage for his next project despite the weapons fire around him. The Americans swoop in the join the battle. McClusky orders his men to follow the Japanese as their destroyer makes its way back to the main fleet for reinforcements. The U.S. launch a torpedo at a Japanese battleship, but they miss. Meanwhile, Nagumo and Yamaguchi plot to launch another strike against the air carriers. The pilots proceed to bomb the Japanese battleships, severely wiping out their attache. In the middle of the battle, Gaido and another soldier are found by the Japanese in the ocean and are brought on-board. After Gaido insults them, he is thrown overboard and sunk with an anchor.The Japanese retaliate and destroy Yorktown. Best is informed that his squadron has lost many men and that one Japanese carrier remains, so he rounds up all the men he can to head out and destroy it, which is successfully done. Following the loss of their carriers, Admiral Yamamoto, painfully aware that the Americans had been apparently been aware of their plans and expecting them all this time, orders his fleet to retreat rather than risk more casualties. Washington learns of the Japanese surrender, and they celebrate their victory. Yamaguchi and Nagumo stay behind and go down with their ship as it is bombed.The soldiers return home from their battle. Best, after giving his thanks to Layton for his superb intelligence work that helped make that victory possible, reunites with Ann, informing her that he may not fly again since the doctors told him he inhaled caustic fumes. She is just happy that he is home, safe and sound.There are numerous texts regarding the fates of the American and Japanese men involved, as well as acknowledging that 250,000 Chinese were murdered by the Japanese army for helping the Doolittle Raiders escape, as well as a dedication to all those that gave their lives."

They are brought to a nearby hospital where they have burn marks on their wrists.At home, Anna tries to spend time with her kids. She is a widow, as her husband was killed in the line of duty, and it has been hard on her.Later that night, Carlos is woken up by what sounds like a woman sobbing. He tries to wake up Tomas, but he doesn't hear. A guard checks in on them, and when he leaves, Tomas is out of his bed. Carlos follows him outside into the hallway. Tomas turns around and points to something in the mirror. When Carlos turns around, he sees tears dripping onto the floor before he looks up and is face-to-face with...

When she reaches for it, La Llorona appears and grabs her arm, burning her as well.Anna goes to talk to Patricia in prison. She still angrily believes that Anna caused her boys' deaths. Patricia asks Anna if they have heard La Llorona crying and if they felt the sting of her tears. She admits that she didn't pray to God for the salvation of her boys, but she prayed to La Llorona to take Anna's kids in exchange for her own.Cooper and Donna show up to Anna's house that night when they suspect something is up with the kids, especially with the burns on their arms. The kids lie and say that they fell. After they leave, Anna goes to put the kids to bed. She hears a noise in the darkness and also sees La Llorona, causing her to scream. The kids enter the room after she disappears, and Anna invites the kids to sleep in her room.Later, Anna asks Chris about what has been happening. He tells her he heard La Llorona in Sam's room. Upstairs, Sam is taking a bath when La LLorona attempts to drown her. Anna and Chris hear the commotion and go to save her. As they pull Sam out of the tub, La Llorona grabs Anna's arm and burns her too as Anna sees her horrible face with her bloody tears.Anna goes to the church to ask Perez for help. He says he did not believe in the supernatural until his run-in with a certain doll (Annabelle), but he knows of a former priest named Rafael Olvera (Raymond Cruz) that can help. Anna brings the kids to Rafael's shop to ask for help. Although he appears not interested, he agrees when Sam asks for his help.

As she pulls the doll back inside, the doll breaks the line, and La Llorona pulls her outside. Anna realizes La Llorona will try to drown Sam, so they run to the pool. She jumps in to get Sam, but La Llorona starts attacking her. Rafael then blesses the pool to turn the water holy and force La Llorona out of there. Anna emerges with Sam and La Llorona's pendant.A pounding sound is heard at the door. Patricia shows up with a gun, hellbent on delivering Anna's kids to the demon.

Chris pulls out the pendant that he took from his mom and shows it to La Llorona. For a brief moment, she appears as her former human self and approaches Chris and Sam. Sam then accidentally unveils a mirror, causing La Llorona to see her hideous demonic reflection and wail. Patricia has a change of heart and lets Anna and Rafael run up to the attic to fight La Llorona. Rafael attempts to hold her off with his cross, but she throws him back. Anna runs to protect her kids, and as La Llorona approaches, Rafael throws Anna the cross.

The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs. Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education to get the job. In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend ""Jessica"", really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims. In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired. The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks' housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoong's housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves. The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their quest to become their version of the Parks.—Huggo Jobless, penniless, and, above all, hopeless, the unmotivated patriarch, Ki-taek, and his equally unambitious family--his supportive wife, Chung-sook; his cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung, and his college-age son, Ki-woo--occupy themselves by working for peanuts in their squalid basement-level apartment. Then, by sheer luck, a lucrative business proposition will pave the way for an ingeniously insidious scheme, as Ki-woo summons up the courage to pose as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the affluent Park family. Now, the stage seems set for an unceasing winner-take-all class war. How does one get rid of a parasite?—Nick Riganas After his rich friend asks him to fake qualifications and take his tutor role to a rich teenage girl so none will try to date her in his absence, the poor lead takes up the offer & enters the rich yet gullible family. He then cons his way into the family, dates his friend's crush & schemes to get all his family get a job under the family. When the owners leave the house on vacation they move in & undergo a bizarre encounter which changes the lives of everyone. Ki-woo Kim (Choi Woo-Shik) is a young man living in poverty in the slums of a nameless South Korean city with his family - father Ki-taek Kim (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook Kim (Jang Hye-jin), and sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). The family lives in a garden unit where they struggle finding a Wi-Fi signal to sneak into in order to get access to the Internet to watch TV, get fumigated on, and have to watch men urinating in the alley outside their home. They make ends meet by doing menial tasks such as folding pizza boxes - and even then, get criticized by the pizza employees for messing up the boxes. Ki-woo's wealthy friend Min-hyuk pays the family a visit, giving them a gift - a rock that is supposed to bring those who have it wealth and prosperity. He then tells Ki-woo that he has been tutoring the teenage daughter of a very wealthy family. He is leaving to study abroad but is in love with the daughter, and knows that any of the other university boys would steal her away. He wants Ki-woo to be her tutor, knowing he will watch over her so that Min-hyuk can propose to her once she graduates high school. Ki-woo knows he isn't qualified since he isn't in college, but Min-hyuk promises to vouch for him, and so he agrees and has Ki-jung forge credentials for him to take to his interview.Ki-woo interviews at the very wealthy Park family where he meets Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), his scatterbrained wife Mrs. Park (Choi Yeo-jeong), and their children, teenage daughter Da-hye and young son Da-song. Ki-woo realizes he needs to flirt with Da-hye to get the job, and he does - Mrs. Park pays him an exorbitant amount of money and mentions they need an art tutor for Da-song. Da-song had a traumatic incident where he saw a ""ghost"" in the house and had a seizure and has been needing help with his art. Ki-woo introduces them to Ki-jung, who forges documents for herself and goes by ""Jessica,"" and she too begins making money hand over fist. When the Park's limo driver takes her home, Ki-jung leaves her underwear in the car in order to get him fired: she then suggests her ""Uncle"" as the new driver - who is really Ki-taek. The last position is that of the housekeeper, Moon-kwang (Lee Jeung-eun). She has worked for the home since before the Park family lived there - she worked for the previous owner, an eccentric architect. In order to get her fired, the Kims exploit her allergy to peaches, causing her to have allergic reactions: they then convince Mrs. Park that she is seriously contagiously ill and cannot be around their son. She leaves, devastated, and Mrs. Kim is given the job, fooling the Park family into hiring the entire Kim family.The Kim family enjoys their massive increase of income, and when the Park family decides to leave to go camping for Da-song's birthday weekend, they take the opportunity to stay in the huge Park house for the weekend. They spend the evening drinking and eating and making a mess of the place when the doorbell rings: it's Moon-kwang. She claims she was fired so quickly she left without being able to get something and just wants it back. Mrs. Kim reluctantly lets her in, and Moon-kwang runs into the basement and begins screaming, opening a secret passage behind some shelves. She goes to her husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), who has secretly been living in the bunker ever since the previous owner moved out in order to hide from loan sharks. She gives him food while Mrs. Kim looks on in horror - she tells Moon-kwang she needs to leave, and as Moon-kwang begs her to let them stay, the rest of the Kim family (who had been eavesdropping) falls off the stairs and into view - and they call each other ""dad,"" etc., which Moon-kwang films on her phone, realizing the con the family has pulled. She threatens to send it to the Park family and uses that so she and her husband can force the Kim family to do their bidding.The Kim family manages to get the upper hand on them, getting them into the secret bunker, but the Park family calls: they've canceled their camping trip due to rain and will be home in eight minutes. The Kims scramble, trying to clean up as much mess as they can, keeping the other two in the basement. They manage to do a good enough job that the rest of the family is able to hide while Mrs. Kim gives the Parks their dinner - when Moon-kwang breaks out and runs upstairs, Mrs. Kim shoves her back down the stairs, where she hits her head and is severely wounded. Moon-kwang and Geun-sae are locked in the bunker. Mr. and Mrs. Park end up sleeping in the living room in order to keep an eye on Da-song who is camping out in the backyard, forcing the Kims to stay under the table, frozen all night, even as the Parks complain about Mr. Kim's smell - and then later, have sex. Eventually, in the dead of night, they are able to sneak out. They return home to find their apartment completely flooded with rain and sewage. Ki-woo takes the rock, and the family sleeps in a shelter for the night.The next day, Mrs. Park decides to throw an impromptu party for Da-song. The Kim family, in their roles as help, are invited and have to pretend that they don't know that there are two people locked in a bunker under the house. Ki-woo takes the rock down into the bunker, where Moon-kwang has died and is ambushed by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him in the head with the rock. He then enters the party, where he stabs Ki-jung in the chest. The party explodes into horror, and Da-song has a seizure - Geun-sae was the ""ghost"" he had seen in the house prior. Mr. Park screams at his driver, Mr. Kim - who is trying to stop Ki-jung's bleeding - for the car keys to take his son to the hospital, and he throws them to him. They land under Geun-sae, who is fighting with Mrs. Kim. She manages to kill him by stabbing him with a meat skewer. Mr. Park gets the keys but expresses disgusts at Geun-sae's smell - this triggers Mr. Kim, who snaps and stabs Mr. Park, killing him. Mrs. Park faints as Mr. Kim flees.Ki-woo wakes up in the hospital, where he had been in a coma for weeks. He finds out that Ki-jung has died, and he and Mrs. Kim are sentenced to probation. There has been no sign of Mr. Kim, even though the police have been searching for him for Mr. Park's murder far and wide. Ki-woo leaves the rock in a river and observes the former Park house where he sees the lights flickering - Ki-woo translates the flickering from Morse code, and learns Mr. Kim is controlling them from inside the bunker, where he is now living, sneaking upstairs for food from the new owners. Ki-woo writes his father a letter back, resolving that someday he will become wealthy enough that he can buy the house and their family can be reunited."

Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) travels to the outer edges of the solar system to find his missing father and unravel a mystery that threatens the survival of our planet. His journey will uncover secrets that challenge the nature of human existence and our place in the cosmos. As a series of immense energy surges sweep the entire solar system and the unprotected Earth, the U.S. Space Command suspects that the reasons behind the space anomaly may be the ambitious Lima Project and the renowned long-lost astronaut, Clifford McBride. Now, Clifford's composed son and impeccable astronaut, Major Roy McBride, has to travel to the edge of the cosmos on a manned mission to the cold blue planet, Neptune, to see firsthand whether his father is still alive, and, hopefully, locate the source of a problem that threatens the stability of our vast galaxy. The answers we seek lie 4.3 billion kilometres away; however, in the unending emptiness of space, is Roy prepared to answer the ultimate question? Is anybody out there?—Nick Riganas 30 years ago Dr Clifford McBride and his crew set off on an expedition to Neptune. At a point all contact was lost and the expedition is assumed to have failed. Now, life in the Solar System is under threat as strange energy surges are experienced, caused by activity on Neptune. US Space Command is convinced that McBride is behind this and sends McBride's son Roy, a highly competent and experienced astronaut, to Neptune to seek answers.—grantss In the near future, space travel is routine, but unexplained energy surges from Neptune cause chaos on Earth and other planets.

Clifford McBride, who vanished during the ""Lima Project"" searching for extraterrestrial life. Roy embarks on a dangerous journey to Mars, facing various challenges like asteroid storms and space pirates. He also reflects on his distant relationship with his father, a legendary astronaut more dedicated to exploration than family. Upon reaching Mars, Roy learns that the Lima Project might have encountered something dangerous in deep space. As he continues to the moon, he discovers evidence of extraterrestrial life that may have harmed the Lima Project crew. As Roy approaches Neptune, the surges intensify, and he reunites with his father on the Lima Project spacecraft. Clifford is disoriented and obsessed with contacting intelligent life, even if it risks human lives. Roy tries to convince him to stop the dangerous experiments. Roy realizes that the energy surges are linked to the antimatter power source on the Lima Project ship. He decides to take action to prevent further damage, leading to a life-changing decision. The movie follows Roy's journey of self-discovery, exploring themes of isolation, the search for meaning, and the complexities of human relationships. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Roy McBride adds depth to the character and makes ""Ad Astra"" an engaging blend of technology and personal introspection.—jp-176-838709 In the near future, the Solar System is being struck by mysterious power surges of unknown origin, threatening the future of human life. After surviving an incident on an immense space antenna caused by one of these surges, Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), son of famed pioneering astronaut H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) is informed by U.S. Space Command (SpaceCom), the United States Armed Forces branch operating in Space, that the source of the surges has been traced to the ""Lima Project"" base. The Lima Project had been sent some 26 years prior to search for intelligent life from the farthest regions of the Solar System under Clifford McBride's leadership, and disappeared 16 years prior in orbit around Neptune. A SpaceCom officer informs Roy that they believe Clifford may still be alive, and Roy is tasked with the mission of traveling to Mars to try and establish communication with him. Roy accepts the mission, and is joined by an old associate of his father, Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland).After taking a commercial flight to the Moon, Roy and Colonel Pruitt are escorted by US military personnel to the SpaceCom lunar base, taking them across no-man's-land. En route to the base via lunar rovers, they are ambushed by scavenging pirates, who kill most of the group except for Roy and Pruitt. After reaching the base, a dying Pruitt is placed into intensive care. Roy transfers to a SpaceCom flight, crewed by four SpaceCom officers, whom make up of Captain Lawrence Tanner (Donnie Keshawarz), Donald Stanford (Loren Dean), Franklin Yoshida (Bobby Nish), and Lorraine Deavers (Kimberly Elise). The crew aboard the Cepheus then flies to Mars.During the journey to Mars, the ship receives a distress signal from a Norwegian bio medical research space station. Boarding the space station, Roy and the ship's captain find it abandoned, only to be attacked by an aggressive baboon escaped from the Norwegian station. The ape kills Captain Tanner before being neutralized by Roy. Another baboon attacks Roy but he is able to escape the station with the captain's body.While preparing to make a routine landing on Mars, another power surge hits the ship, forcing manual intervention. The interim captain finds himself too scared to fly, leaving Roy to take the controls and land the ship safely.Having landed on Mars (which apparently has only one manned settlement), Roy first goes through the cold the moody customs office headed by the sole customs officer and employee Tanya Pincus (Natasha Lyonne) before he is taken to the underground SpaceCom base, where he briefly meets Helen Lantos (Ruth Negga), the facility director, and is then tasked with recording voice messages to be sent to the Lima Project, in hopes that Clifford will respond. After going off-script, the crew apparently receive a response, but Roy is abruptly taken off the mission, as his personal connection to the mission is deemed to pose a psychological risk to himself and the mission's success.While being kept in a ""comfort room"", he is visited by Lantos, who reveals she is a native Martian and has only been once to Earth as a child. She also reveals that she is the daughter of Lima Project crew-members. In a secret conversation, she shows Roy classified footage from the Lima Project, revealing that Clifford's crew mutinied against him trying to return back to Earth, leading him to kill them all by turning off their life-support systems, and that her parents were among the crew killed. She also tells him that the crew that brought him to Mars are soon heading to the Lima Project base themselves, where they intend to destroy it with a nuclear payload. The two decide that Roy is the only person who should confront Clifford, and Helen sneaks Roy out of the base, leading him to an underground lake beneath the rocket launch site.As the rocket takes off, Roy climbs aboard, and after being discovered, the crew is instructed to neutralize him. The ensuing altercation results, despite Roy's best efforts, in the death of the entire crew. Now alone, Roy takes command of the ship. During the long journey to Neptune, he reflects on his relationship with his father, as well as that of his estranged wife, Eve. The isolation and stress of the mission take a toll on his mental condition, but after several weeks he arrives at the Lima Project.While approaching the base in a small module, another surge strikes, damaging the module and forcing Roy to enter the base through a space-walk. Finding the Lima base nearly abandoned and most of its crew dead, he plants the nuclear payload and finally meets his father. Clifford McBride, now the sole survivor of the base, explains to his son that the cause of the surges is the ship's malfunctioning anti-matter power source, which was damaged during a mutiny, and which he has been unable to solve. Clifford also reveals that he has continued to work on the project all these years, refusing to lose faith in the possibility of non-human intelligent life.Despite his father's protests, Roy arms the payload and prepares to return to his ship with Clifford, who ultimately resorts to using the thrusters on his spacesuit to launch himself into deep space, refusing to go back to Earth. Roy tries to save him, but Clifford refuses the help, leaving a distraught Roy to watch as his father drifts away in Neptune's orbit. Alone, Roy manages to thrust himself back onto his ship, going through Neptune's ring using a piece of the Lima Project ship's hull to shield himself, while also bringing along with him the data retrieved from the base. Not having enough fuel to return on his own power, he uses the shock-wave from the nuclear explosion to propel the ship home.Finding that the Lima Project data strongly suggests that humans are the only intelligent life in the universe, Roy finds himself imbued with a renewed desire to reconnect with those closest to him, and returns to Earth with a new-found sense of optimism. He seemingly reconnects with his wife."
Isn't It Romantic,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2452244/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young woman disenchanted with love mysteriously finds herself trapped inside a romantic comedy. A fat single female architect has problems finding a man. She hates romcoms with unrealistic happy endings. At her NYC office she's treated disrespectful by all but her two friends. She instantly falls for the new handsome customer. She hits her head during a mugging and wakes up as the main character in a romcom where men find her cute. The handsome customer falls for her.—Scott Filtenborg The film opens sometime in the early 90's in Australia. Young Natalie (Alex Kis) is watching Pretty Woman and enjoying it until her mother (Jennifer Saunders) comes in and tells her she shouldn't watch romantic comedies because women like her and Natalie don't get happy endings the way beautiful women like Julia Roberts do. This breaks Natalie's spirit and causes her to enjoy the movie less.25 years later, Natalie (now played by Rebel Wilson) works as an architect in New York City. She is kind of a pushover amongst her coworkers and is frequently viewed as (in her eyes, anyway) the 'coffee bitch'. Her only friends are Josh (Adam Devine) and Whitney (Betty Gilpin), the latter being Natalie's assistant. They receive a new client, handsome billionaire Blake (Liam Hemsworth), and as Natalie goes to join them for a presentation, Blake mistakes Natalie's coffee for his, and her boss makes her go grab Blake a fresh one. Later, Natalie catches Whitney watching The Wedding Singer and crying. Natalie chastises her and goes on a cynical three-hour rant about why romantic comedies are bullshit and why they set bad examples with their cliches. Josh later tries to invite Natalie to hang out, but she rudely brushes him off, and Whitney tells Natalie that more people would notice her if she were more open.Natalie takes the subway home when she sees a guy on the other train trying to get her attention. They meet up, and he appears friendly, but he then attacks Natalie and tries to take her bag. They fight for it, and she ends up disabling him, but as she runs away, Natalie runs face-first into a pole, knocking herself unconscious.Natalie wakes up in a hospital and is greeted by a good-looking doctor who starts flirting with her. She is more creeped out than charmed, and she leaves after being discharged. When she walks out, she notices that New York doesn't smell like crap and instead smells like lavender. Natalie walks into the street and gets hit by Blake's limo. He is now more charming to her and he takes her home in a matter of seconds and leaves her his number by writing them on flower petals and then expecting Natalie to remember despite him giving them to her in a random order.. She goes into her apartment and finds that it is larger, nicer, and that she owns every shoe ever made, and that they fit her perfectly. Her dog is also well-groomed and obedient now. Also, her grumpy neighbor Donny (Brandon Scott Jones) is now a wildly flamboyant stereotypical gay best friend.At work, Natalie finds that Whitney doesn't work for her and is now in competition with her. Everything just seems weirder to Natalie. She steps out for a walk with Josh, and as they go through the park, they see a woman choking. Josh goes to help her, and she turns out to be a gorgeous swimsuit model named Isabella (Priyanka Chopra), the same model from a billboard outside Natalie's office that she thinks Josh is always gawking at. There appears to be an instant spark between them, and they go out together, leaving Natalie alone. As she walks around by herself and randomly trips on things while strange handsome men compliment her, in addition to the random people dancing in the park, Natalie comes to the conclusion that she is in a PG-13 romantic comedy.Natalie goes around trying to undo everything and knock herself unconscious again. This just creeps out other guys, and as Natalie attempts to step in front of a train, she is pulled back by a cop who is literally named Officer Hansom. He arrests her for having not paid her fare, and she uses her one phone call to contact Blake, and the petals magically align themselves properly so that Natalie can know the right way to call him. Blake picks her up, and Natalie figures that she has to get him to fall in love with her in order to get herself out of the Rom-com world.After doing an off screen makeover montage with Donny, Natalie goes on a date with Blake looking glammed up. It goes well, ending with a romantic kiss in the middle of a city street. When the two go back to his place to get intimate, it immediately cuts to the next morning. Natalie tries two more times to have sex with Blake and actually experience it, but it keeps cutting over and jumping to the next day. Blake then tells Natalie that he loves her, but it doesn't change anything for her and she is still stuck in the Rom-com.Natalie is later visited by Josh with some Chinese food. The two laugh and joke together, actually having genuine chemistry together. However, it gets ruined when Blake shows up and acts like a dick to Josh, which makes him leave.Natalie and Blake run into Josh and Isabella, and the latter two invite the former two to Isabella's place in the Hamptons for a party they are having. Natalie and Blake head up there, where Natalie and Josh take another stroll together, indicating that Natalie is actually falling for Josh. This is ruined moments later when Josh and Isabella announce that they are getting married the following day. Everyone then heads over to a nearby bar for karaoke. Natalie goes up to sing 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody', but a waitress accidentally unplugs the mic. Natalie keeps the song going and gets help from others, turning it into a full-blown musical number.In the morning, Natalie finds that Blake is trying to pass off her ideas as his own. He defends it by saying that she won't have to work when she's with him, but she likes being an architect and she breaks up with Blake. Upset, she goes to talk to Donny, who gives her some inspiring words based on his own personal experiences. Natalie then realizes that if she loves Josh, she has to go do the ultimate Rom-com cliche of stopping a wedding in slow motion. Natalie gets to the church and gives a big speech to Josh, thinking she will admit she loves him after telling him why he should be with her instead, but she has come to realize that she loves herself, and that is the lesson she was supposed to learn. Natalie leaves the wedding and decides to steal the brand new car Josh and Isabella would have driven, but she is distracted and drives head-first into a wall.Natalie wakes up in another hospital and sees that the doctor there is also a stud, and she fears she is still stuck in the Rom-com world. However, the real doctor (an older man) comes in and makes the other guy leave, as he is just an actor preparing for a role. Natalie pulls a needle out of her arm and yells out 'Fuck!' which leads her to figure out she is back to her reality. She runs home and is happy to see her lousy apartment and lame dog. Outside, she finds that Donny actually is gay in real life, and that he is a weed dealer, leading Natalie to hug him. She returns to work and reaffirms her friendship with Whitney, but makes it clear that she has to stop watching movies at work. She then goes to deliver a presentation to her boss and Blake for a parking garage for a hotel that Blake is set to open. He likes Natalie's pitch, and it appears that the boss does too. Natalie then goes over to Josh's cubicle and tells him he shouldn't live in a fantasy staring at the billboard of Isabella. Josh then has Natalie sit in his chair to make it clear to her that he does not even have a full view of the billboard, and instead he was always looking at Natalie. She is touched, and the two kiss.Natalie walks out for coffee, and she is greeted downstairs with Whitney, who points out that now that she has made it to her dream job and has a guy who worships her, it's almost like she is in an actual romantic comedy. Natalie scoffs at the idea and says that all that needs to happen is a musical number.The film then cuts to the credits where the cast perform a musical number."

They must wait until she is out of sight, allowing Henry to take the shot. He just manages to strike Dormov in the neck, but he still kills him. Marino later shows Henry a video of civilians' reactions to Dormov's killing on the train. He orders Marino to delete it, as he wants no memory or image of that in his head.Henry decides to retire from the assassin life and is later visited by his handler, Del Patterson (Ralph Brown).

He tells Henry that Dormov was actually an innocent man working as a molecular biologist who worked in the States for 30 years. Jack thinks Henry's file on Dormov was spiked. When Henry asks where he is getting this information, Jack tells him it's his informant in Budapest, Yuri Kovacs (Ilia Volok), and he passes on this information. This whole encounter is bugged and listened in on by DIA director Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond) and GEMINI director Clay Varris (Clive Owen). Clay orders Lassiter to find a way to take care of Henry.Henry goes back to the shop and suspects Dani of working with the DIA and is following him. She denies it, and Henry feels like a jerk, so he invites her out for dinner. During their outing, it is confirmed that Dani is DIA, but she says she was following in her FBI father's footsteps. Henry also mentions his retirement and why he is choosing to leave this life behind.Later that night, a team of insurgents sneak onto Jack's boat to kill him and his girlfriend, and then dump their bodies in the water. Soon after, Henry wakes up at home and realizes men are breaking in. He calls Marino to warn him, but he hears him get killed over the phone. Henry has no choice but to run.

When Dani is left alone for a moment, she is attacked by a mercenary, but she gets the upper hand on him and beats the information out of him (along with some teeth). Dani confirms to Henry that Lassiter sent them.Henry and Dani ride a boat out somewhere obscure until they are found by Henry's pilot friend Baron (Benedict Wong). Henry contacts Del just to figure out what is going on. He tells him about GEMINI working with the DIA to wipe out their agents. It turns out that Dormov was working with GEMINI, and Henry figures out Clay's involvement. Henry asks Dani what she knows about GEMINI, which is just a paramilitary organization run by Clay, who originally wanted Henry and Baron to join him since they knew him as a marine, but they both declined. GEMINI specializes in wiping out specific targets with the utmost discretion.The trio go to Cartagena, Columbia temporarily. In their hotel room, Henry spots a shooter running across the adjacent rooftops. Henry runs out and starts shooting at the man. He quickly discovers that the shooter looks exactly like him, and he is named ""Junior"". He utilizes the exact same skill set as Henry, which makes him hard to strike. Junior chases Henry as they both ride motorbikes, resulting in Junior trying to hit Henry with his flaming bike before it explodes. Before Junior can kill Henry, authorities arrive, and he flees. Baron and Dani ""take"" Henry into custody as they head somewhere safer. Henry figures out their next move is to go to Budapest to meet Yuri to get more information from him. Baron finds someone who loans him a plane to get them there.Junior goes to his safe-house to treat his wounds. He is met by Clay, who makes Junior feel like a son (hence ""Junior""). Junior expresses his astonishment at Henry managing to dodge his attacks and moves, but he didn't actually get a good look at his target. Clay later shows Junior the training exercises that other GEMINI operatives go through.Dani reveals to Henry that she sent DNA samples of himself and the cap that Junior was wearing, which reveals that Junior is Henry's clone. Henry is left bewildered at why a clone of himself would be sent to kill him.The trio arrive in Budapest and meet Yuri. He tells Henry that he is against Clay as well, and reveals that Dormov worked with GEMINI on the cloning project. He helped design clones that could be stronger and smarter, but Clay wanted soldiers without consciences and pain. Dormov walked away from the project and was marked for death.Henry gets a messenger to find Lassiter and inform her that he knows everything about her, so if she sends someone to kill him again, he will send someone after her first. He tries to negotiate with her to send Junior to him in order to let Dani get back to the U.S. safely. Lassiter arranges for Junior to be sent to Budapest, and he later meets Dani alone in a garden. He orders her to strip to make sure she isn't wearing a wire. He then takes her in and informs Henry about this to get him closer, and they agree to meet somewhere specific. On the ride there, Dani tries to talk to Junior to prove that he is not the cold-blooded killer he was bred to be. When she asks him why he is trying to kill Henry, Junior says he was told that Henry killed the other operatives that GEMINI killed.Henry manages to catch Junior and free Dani. He tells Junior he doesn't want to kill him but will do so if necessary. Henry also tells him who Clay really is, as well as who Junior is, expressing how empty they both feel unless they are killing someone. Junior learns he is a clone, but he doesn't want to believe it. He fights Henry and almost kills him before Dani intervenes, and Junior escapes. He returns to GEMINI and asks Clay to tell him the truth. Clay does, but he assures Junior that he is better than Henry, and that he is Clay's son.After returning home, Junior finds Henry, Dani, and Baron. He hits Henry with bee venom, knowing they are both allergic to bees, but then quickly administers an epipen. Junior decides to team up with the trio to stop Clay for good. Junior asks more questions about Henry's life to know what his own history would have been like. As they drive into town, Clay contacts Junior and tells him to run. They are hit by an ambush when a tank rolls in. Henry, Dani, and Junior jump out of the van, but Baron is killed when the tank blows it up. Soon, more GEMINI operatives start to attack, including one wearing all armor and firing a machine gun at the heroes. Henry and Junior manage to kill the operatives, but the armored one goes after them. Junior finds Clay, and they start fighting, with Junior managing to knock Clay out. They manage to subdue and kill the armored man, and he is revealed to be another clone of Henry. Clay regains consciousness and finds them. He tells Henry that this was all to reduce the cost of human life in warfare, and using someone as skilled as Henry was the perfect plan. Junior aims his gun at Clay, but Henry stops him from killing him, as he doesn't want Junior to feel the same trauma from killing people. Henry instead decides to blast a hole in Clay's chest.Sometime later, GEMINI's program is shut down, and there are no more clones running around. Henry and Dani meet on a college campus where Junior is now attending with the name ""Jackson Brogan"", using Henry's mother's maiden name. The three walk off together."

June, an optimistic, imaginative girl, discovers an incredible amusement park called Wonderland hidden in the woods. The park is full of fantastical rides and talking, funny animals - only the park is in disarray. June soon discovers the park came from her imagination and she's the only one who can fix it, so she bands together with the animals to save this magical place and bring back the wonder in Wonderland.—Wulf97 June Bailey and her mother come up with the story of Wonderland, a magical amusement park run by animal creatures that entertain and dazzle children of all ages. The gang consists of Boomer, a big blue bear that greets patrons; Greta, a boar who manages and keeps things under control; Gus and Cooper, beaver brothers; Steve, a porcupine who is in love with Greta; and the park's mascot/leader Peanut, a monkey who hears Mrs. Bailey's voice and is given the inspiration to create with his magic marker.As June gets older, her imagination grows. She and her friend Banky create a contraption that functions like a theme park ride, but it goes out of control and causes massive damage to the town. June's parents scold her, but her mom tells her she can keep her imagination going as long as it doesn't destroy the neighborhood.Over time, the family continues to have fun, but Mrs. Bailey starts to get sick. She is sent away for recovery, leaving June scared and depressed. She starts to become cynical and refuses to play with the other kids because she thinks they only care about her giving them Wonderland. June and her father are then visited by Uncle Tony and Aunt Albertine. They try to cheer June up by sparking her imagination with talk of Wonderland, but June snaps and throws out the map of Wonderland into the fire before running to her room to cry.Mr. Bailey gets ready to send June to math camp with Banky and their other friends. Barely ten minutes into the bus ride, June becomes paranoid that her father will not be able to handle himself without her, so she uses Banky to create a distraction on the bus and get them to pull over. June uses the opportunity to run back home through the woods. She then finds a burnt piece of the Wonderland map flying toward it. June chases after it as it takes her deeper into the woods, and she finds herself in a completely different place. She steps inside a rocket ride and is transported into Wonderland before her very eyes...or at least, what used to be Wonderland.When June gets down to the park, she finds the animals all fleeing in terror from a dark storm cloud. Emerging from it are Chimpanzombies, formerly the park's Wonder Chimps now becoming terrible troublemakers. The animals run and evade the Chimpanzombies. June introduces herself and tells the animals that she and her mom are responsible for creating them. Greta seems to be suspicious of June being there, but she proves what she knows about them due to naming a very specific way that Steve drinks his tea. June asks them what happened to Peanut, and they tell her that he went off on his own to reactivate Clockwork Springs to bring the park back to life, but he was captured by the Chimpanzombies.June leads the animals to Clockwork Springs to help fix it, but she doesn't seem to know what she is supposed to do. The Chimpanzombies then attack once again in a giant robot that wreaks more havoc across the park. In the chaos, June gets separated from the animals and finds herself in Zero Gravity Land. There, she finds Peanut hiding in a room he created to escape the darkness. He feels lost without hearing the voice in his head and he chooses to stay alone so that he can't get hurt. This leads June to realize that the darkness was created by herself as a result of her cynicism from her mom's sickness. The Chimpanzombies then show up and attack once again and take Peanut as their prisoner, but June manages to escape with Peanut's marker.June runs back to the animals to tell them that she found Peanut and his marker, but also confesses that she is responsible for the darkness. The animals are all upset, but Greta is especially displeased. They abandon June and leave her alone and helpless. After taking a moment, June gathers the courage inside her to reactivate her imagination and get a robot up and running to join the animals to help them. As they come up with a plan to stop the Chimpanzombies, they put Boomer on top of a roller coaster. His car gets pushed over by a bird, leading him to roll down the roller coaster without safety. The other animals manage to get him to come to a stop.The gang finds the Chimpanzombies taking Peanut to get sucked up into the darkness. The animals fight back while June rushes to save Peanut. She jumps up into the void and reaches Peanut. She convinces him that she will provide the voice for his imagination and that he cannot let the darkness take him over.

Rambo: Last Blood,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206885/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Rambo must confront his past and unearth his ruthless combat skills to exact revenge in a final mission. Almost four decades after they drew first blood, Sylvester Stallone is back as one of the greatest action heroes of all time, John Rambo. Now, Rambo must confront his past and unearth his ruthless combat skills to exact revenge in a final mission. A deadly journey of vengeance, RAMBO: LAST BLOOD marks the last chapter of the legendary series. After the blood-soaked ballet of bullets inRambo (2008), the last survivor of an elite unit of Green Berets, John Rambo, finds himself unable to keep the terrors of this world at bay, still trying to keep the lid on his simmering emotions. Secluded in his deceased father's horse ranch in Arizona, John--along with his teen niece, Gabrielle, and her grandmother, Maria--leads a serene life, until an urgent invitation drags the gullible seventeen-year-old girl to the squalid slums of Mexico, in search of a ghost. Now, even though he tried so hard to renounce his former violent self, once more, John is on the warpath, many painful decades after the bitter guerrilla warfare inFirst Blood (1982). Nearly all his life, John has been fighting a seemingly interminable war, seeking a place he could call home. But, what's the good of pursuing a beautiful dream when everyone you love has gone?—Nick Riganas The film opens in Arizona where the aged John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) now lives on his late father's ranch, which he shares with his close friend Maria Beltran (Adriana Barraza) and her teenage granddaughter Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), the latter who views Rambo as something of an uncle. In the years since his last battle in Burma, Rambo has been plagued with PTSD and is still haunted by the memories of death and bloodshed from Vietnam to Afghanistan and Burma. He has also been constructing a series of tunnels beneath the ranch.Gabrielle asks if she can invite friends over to the tunnels for a party, which Rambo allows. During the party, Gabrielle is contacted by her friend Jezel (Fenessa Pineda), who has information on Gabrielle's long lost father Miguel (Marco de la O). She explains her situation to Rambo, who knows the man and tells Gabrielle that she should not have to go looking for a man that never bothered to have any part in her life. He also adds that he knows how terrible men can be, and pursuing this man would only hurt her. This carries into the next morning when Gabrielle argues with Maria about going to Mexico to find Miguel, who apparently used to beat Gabrielle's mother before Rambo intervened.Gabrielle pretends to be heading out somewhere nearby, but she instead drives to Mexico to meet with Jezel. She leads Gabrielle to Miguel's house. He privately speaks to her and firmly tells her that he never wanted anything to do with her or her mother. Gabrielle leaves in tears, but Jezel tries to cheer her up by taking her out to a club. There, Gabrielle talks to a man and has drinks before he slips drugs into her drink.The next day, Maria gets a call from Jezel saying Gabrielle has disappeared. Rambo takes it upon himself to drive out to Mexico and find Gabrielle himself. He stops at Miguel's house and intimidates him by saying he should have broken his neck all those years earlier, and that this whole mess is his own fault. Rambo then locates Jezel and quickly figures that she sold Gabrielle into a human trafficking ring after he notices that Jezel is wearing Gabrielle's bracelet that belonged to her mother.We then see that Gabrielle is lined up among other kidnapped young women being held captive by a cartel. One of the leaders, Victor Martinez (Oscar Jaenada), drags in one woman who tried to escape inside and threatens them all with death if they try to escape again.Rambo forces Jezel to take him to the club where she took Gabrielle. There, they spot the man that Gabrielle was talking to. Rambo is observed by a nearby woman named Carmen Delgado (Paz Vega). Rambo follows the man to his car and threatens him with his knife. When he refuses to talk, Rambo hits him hard in the shoulder with the butt end of the blade before stabbing him in the leg and then viciously digging into the shoulder wound to crack his bones painfully before the man reveals where Gabrielle was taken.Rambo drives to the location of the cartel's base where he is easily spotted. Carmen has also followed him. Victor is joined by his brother Hugo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) and their gang of men. Rambo walks to meet with the brothers with the men surrounding him. He takes out a picture of Gabrielle, and the brothers recognize her. The gang beats Rambo badly, and Hugo threatens Rambo with hurting Gabrielle since he came out for her. Victor then marks Rambo by cutting a V on his cheek and leaving him there for dead. He is rescued by Carmen, but the brothers torture Gabrielle.Over the next few days, Rambo recovers in Carmen's house while Gabrielle is forced into trafficking, made more passive by drugs they inject her with. Meanwhile, Maria can only sit around and wait for Rambo and Gabrielle to return. After Rambo wakes up, Carmen tells him that her sister was kidnapped by the Martinez brothers' cartel and she was killed. She has been investigating them ever since in the hopes of bringing them down. Rambo gets himself ready to get Gabrielle back.Rambo infiltrates a brothel and slaughters the men running the place, as well as several unlucky clients. He orders the women to run, but they all say that they will be killed if they run. He manages to find Gabrielle's room, where she is barely conscious. Rambo picks her up and carries her out of there. The Martinez brothers later come across the place and know that Rambo is responsible for the deaths of all their men. Victor chastises Hugo for not killing Rambo when they had the chance.On the drive back to Arizona, Rambo tries telling Gabrielle that she has been a source of hope for him in the years since he came back home, and that he cares about her a lot. Sadly, Gabrielle dies moments later after succumbing to the excess drugs. Rambo returns home in the morning and must break the news to Maria.Rambo and Maria bury Gabrielle on his ranch. Maria leaves the house to go stay with her sister, and she tells Rambo that she will remain sad until the day she dies. Rambo, now fueled by hatred and revenge, begins to rig the tunnels and set traps across the ranch. He returns to Mexico to ask for Carmen's help in finding Victor. She is hesitant at first since she doesn't think that any good will come of it, but Rambo convinces her since these men are responsible for the deaths of people they both loved.Rambo locates Victor's home and proceeds to slay every man in his path before getting to Victor. When Hugo arrives, he finds Victor's headless and bloodied corpse on the bed with Gabrielle's picture stabbed into his chest. Rambo is then seen driving back, and he tosses Victor's head on the highway. Hugo and his men prepare for war and steal across the border through tunnels dug underneath the fence.The cartel drives to Rambo's ranch where he waits for them. The first vans that drive onto the property get blown up by one of the roadside booby traps. The rest of the men begin to storm the tunnels, where they get impaled by other traps or get blown up by C4 explosives. Rambo lurks in the darkness and blasts any man that he finds, as well as dismembers them with his blade. As Hugo loses more and more men, Rambo gets closer to him and sends out a message through the radio to let Hugo know that his death is coming. Rambo blows up the tunnels to bury all the remaining men underground, but Hugo manages to get out and make it into the barn. Unfortunately for him, Rambo is waiting, and he fires four arrows at Hugo to pin him against the wall. Rambo approaches him and tells him that because Hugo ripped out Rambo's heart in the figurative sense, Rambo will now do that to him literally. He cuts deep into Hugo's chest with his blade before pulling his heart out and showing it to him before Hugo dies.Rambo, wounded from the fight, goes to sit in his rocking chair on his front porch. His voice-over states that he is now alone, as everyone he has ever loved is now gone, but he will continue to fight to keep their memories alive. After a while, Rambo picks himself up and rides his horse into the sunset."

He names the dog Bella and takes her home to live with him and his mother, Terri Ray. Over the years, Lucas plays with and takes care of Bella. However, Lucas also continues to feed the cats at the old house, putting himself in the crosshairs of Günter Beckenbauer, the man who intends to demolish the house. He even calls the city about the cats who live there, which delays the demolition. Vengeful, Günter notifies animal control that Bella is a pitbull (despite not looking like one), because in Denver, pitbulls are illegal, due to being a dangerous breed. That evening, an overzealous animal control officer named Chuck comes by to warn Lucas that if he finds Bella on the street, he will impound her.The next day, when Bella gets out to chase a squirrel, Lucas catches up to her and prepares to take her home, but Chuck confiscates Bella and takes her into the local animal shelter. Lucas picks Bella up, pays a fine, and is allowed to take her home, but he is warned that if Bella is captured again, she will be euthanized. To avoid this, Lucas sends Bella to live with Olivia's aunt and uncle in Farmington, New Mexico, until he and his mother can find another home outside of Denver's urban limits. However, Bella misses Lucas so much that she leaves Farmington and begins a 400-mile journey home, which will take more than two years to complete.

She reaches the city's VA hospital, where she joyfully reunites with Lucas, Terri, and Olivia. Lucas prepares to take Bella to the vet to treat an injury Bella received due to being struck by a car, but when Lucas, Terri, and Lucas's friends bring Bella outside, Chuck arrives with several police officers, including police captain Mica. Chuck claims that he needs to confiscate Bella again, with the threat to have Lucas and anyone who interferes arrested otherwise. Captain Mica states that he enforces the law, which states that Bella must be impounded, but Lucas and Terri stand up for Bella and explain that there is no reason to confiscate Bella as the VA hospital is federal property, and thus it is not technically part of Denver. Captain Mica allows Lucas to keep Bella as he has no jurisdiction. Chuck threatens to pull Lucas over if he sees Bella leave the premises, but Captain Mica admonishes Chuck and pulls him from public field duty for his over-zealousness and the number of complaints against him, then orders the police officers not to pull anybody over just for a dog. Lucas and Olivia are happy to see Bella again and finally manage to move into a house in Golden, where they allow pitbulls.
Meanwhile Big Kitten is revealed to be a mother herself now and she and her cub watch over the city of Denver."

After saving Bird Island from an all-out green-pig invasion inThe Angry Birds Movie (2016), the isle's always cranky local hero, Red, still finds himself doing battle with Pig Island. As the prank war between pigs and birds is raging, massive icy projectiles coming from the feathery tyrant Zeta's ice-capped Eagle Island threaten the security of both havens, unless Red and King Leonard agree to form a difficult but honest truce. Now, Red, Bomb, Mighty Eagle, Chuck, and his brilliant sister, Silver, have to join forces with Leonard's mighty porcine team to thwart the megalomaniac Zeta's bold schemes for world domination. However, is Red capable of change?—Nick Riganas Three years after the Birds destroyed Pig City as retribution for the Pigs' theft of their eggs, Red protects Bird Island from pigs. The pigs, led by King Leonard Mudbeard, are in a prank war against the birds after Piggy Island is rebuilt. Eventually, a giant ice ball from a nearby island called Eagle Island hits the sea near Piggy Island, forcing the pigs to seek a temporary truce with the birds. Zeta, the leader of Eagle Island, is angry with her frozen surroundings and wants to occupy the two islands by shooting ice balls from a super-weapon to force their inhabitants to evacuate.Red's two best friends, Chuck and Bomb, surprise Red and ask him to join them in a speed dating activity, where Red meets Chuck's sister Silver, an engineering student who deems Red incompatible. Leonard visits Red and convinces him to ally with the pigs for a brief amount of time. They recruit Chuck, Bomb, Silver and Bird Island's retired hero, Mighty Eagle. A meeting in Mighty Eagle's cave gets disrupted when an ice ball from Zeta's super-weapon hits Eagle Mountain, which alarms the other birds living on Bird Island.As the team travels to Eagle Island by submarine, Red assures the other birds that they do not need to evacuate.

The duo reunite with the rest of the team and Red gives up leadership to Silver, who establishes a plan to destroy the weapon. Red and Silver put themselves inside an ice ball and roll it down the spiraling ammunition track of Zeta's super weapon, with their allies working to sever the track by reaching and pulling a switch so that the ball would fly off and crush the cannon, but the plan fails and the team gets confronted by Zeta and her guards, giving her a chance to fire the weapon.Mighty Eagle arrives and makes a desperate attempt to stop Zeta by apologizing to her. Zeta brushes him off, revealing his real name is Ethan and that her servant Debbie is their daughter.

As the string breaks, the hatchlings and the piglets passing by Eagle Island help grasp it. The lava balls slide back into the weapon, destroying it and the base. Everyone escapes, and Mighty Eagle protects Debbie from being crushed by a metal plate, redeeming himself to her and Zeta.

Breakthrough,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7083526/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"When her 14-year-old son drowns in a lake, a faithful mother prays for him to come back from the brink of death and be healed. When he was 14, Smith drowned in Lake Saint Louis and was dead for nearly an hour. According to reports at the time, CPR was performed 27 minutes to no avail. Then the youth's mother, Joyce Smith, entered the room, praying loudly. Suddenly, there was a pulse. It's January 2015 in St. Charles, a suburb of St. Louis. Fourteen year old John Smith, of Guatemalan descent, was adopted by Caucasians Brian and Joyce Smith when John was an infant and they were on a mission in Latin America. John is at the stage of his life where he is acting out, placing barriers between himself and his parents. The only things John seems to care about are basketball having made the school team's first string - and even then he has a tendency to grandstand on the court to prove himself to Chad who he beat out for the position - hanging out with his friends, particularly his best friends Josh and Rieger, and girls, most of his thoughts toward Abby. While Brian tries to connect to John by being his buddy and talking about basketball, Joyce feels they still have to be his parents and not his friends. The church used to be Joyce's sanctuary, but even the physical building of the church and the spirituality she got from it she feels are slowly being taken away from her in she constantly butting heads with the new pastor, Jason Noble, who is trying to take the church in a progressive direction against Joyce's sensibilities. Things for the Smiths change when on Martin Luther King Day, John, Josh and Rieger, against warnings, are playing on frozen St. Louis Lake, they eventually falling through the ice into the water. While first responders are able to pull Josh and Rieger out without incident, John has fallen below the ice unconscious into the murky water below. Although firefighter Joe Marrow believes they are now dealing with a non-emergency recovery rather than an emergency rescue mission, fellow firefighter Tommy Shine is able to locate an unresponsive John. John having been in the water for fifteen minutes, CPR not having been administered until twenty minutes after the fall, and rushing him to the hospital with no pulse for forty five minutes, Dr. Kent Sutterer, the attending ER doctor who happens to be Abby's father, allows Joyce to say her goodbyes to John. It isn't until Joyce is by John's side praying for a miracle that John regains a pulse. Following, differing views emerge as to John's potential recovery and survival. Dr. Garrett, the specialist in drowning cases, can only provide his scientific opinion, which is probable death through the night, and if John does survive, he will have suffered massive and permanent neurological damage with his brain being deprived of oxygen for such a long period of time. Brian, while at the hospital, cannot get himself to see John as he can only take his faith so far before common sense as to what will happen kicks in. Joyce, who has had a need to control things around her most of her life, does so as much as she can in John's situation, while she truly does believe that a miracle can happen as she continues to look to God. Pastor Jason knows he has to bridge what gaps have emerged between him and Joyce for both their and John's sake. And Tommy, a non-religious man, knows that some higher power that day told him to stay in the water to look for John.—Huggo John Smith (Ruiz) is a 14-year-old Guatemalan boy raised in Lake St. Louis, Missouri by his adoptive parents, Brian (Lucas) and Joyce (Metz) Smith. Though they are openly loving and supportive towards him, John struggles with feelings of abandonment from his birth parents as he goes through puberty and self-discovery, and starts rebelling against his parents and teachers.One day John and his class are given an assignment, where they're to give an oral presentation about their family background. On the day he's called to recite, John admits he didn't do the assignment because he didn't have time. Word of this gets back to his basketball coach, who had promised him a starting position on the team. He warns John that if he gets a failing grade, that he will be benched. John later returns and gives a half-hearted presentation, saying that everyone pretty much already knows he's adopted and doesn't know much about his true background.Not long after this, John and his two friends Josh and Reiger (the latter goes by his last name because his first name is also Josh), head onto an iced-over lake near their neighborhood. A nearby resident tells them to get off the ice because it's not safe, but they refuse. The resident leaves to call the police and a short time later, all three fall through a weak spot on the ice. Rescue teams soon arrive and the two Joshes manage to swim to the surface and are rescued. Two first responders get into the hole to try and find John. As they're about to give up, one of the rescuers, Tommy Shine (Colter), hears a voice telling him to go back. Thinking it's his chief, he tries again, and manages to lift John to the surface.With no pulse or breath, John is taken to the local hospital, where a team of medical professionals work frantically to save his life. After John still fails to register a pulse, the attendant physician, Dr. Sutterer, gives Joyce a chance to say goodbye. A weeping Joyce enters the trauma room and cradles her son in her arms. After a moment, a faint pulse begins to register. With renewed hope, Dr. Sutterer recommends transferring John to another hospital better equipped to save his life, citing Dr. Garrett (Haysbert) as an expert in cases like John's.After John is transferred and put in a medically-induced coma, Garrett warns Joyce and Brian that he has little hope for John's recovery, citing that if John were to pull through, he would most likely be in a persistent vegetative state for the rest of his life.Throughout all this is a subplot involving Joyce and Jason Noble (Grace), the new liberal pastor at the family's church, with whom Joyce frequently clashes. Joyce slowly warms to Noble after he shows up at the hospital upon learning of John's accident. Like Joyce, he regards John's progress as divine intervention.Later, John shows some signs of consciousness, as his ability to hear Joyce and Pastor Jason, responding with squeezes to the hand, and a tear trickling from his eye as a crowd gathers outside his hospital window to sing and pray for his recovery.Joyce turns John's possible recovery into an obsession, constantly harassing the health care professionals into making John their only priority, alienating those around her, including her own husband. During a heated moment, Joyce tells Brian that if it wasn't for her, John would be dead, completely forgetting her Christianity which had long been the foundation of her character. After a brief and hurtful rebuttal, Brian storms off.Coming to the realization that she can't control John's outcome, Joyce retreats to the roof of the hospital to pray, asking God for forgiveness and submitting to His will. As she concludes her prayer, it begins to snow, which she believes is an answer. She and Brian meet again with Garrett, who tells them that the drugs they have been administering to John during his medical induced coma are becoming toxic to his system and may be doing more harm than good. Joyce, who had previously been adamant about saving John's life at all costs, suggests stopping treatment and bringing him out of the coma, stating that she's ready for whatever fate brings. Garrett agrees.Garrett administers the drug to bring John from the coma. His body begins to convulse and he slowly begins to regain consciousness, where he re-lives the accident where he fell into the water. He hears his mother's voice and opens his eyes, with full cognitive ability. A few days later, he is discharged from the hospital and returns to school.However, John's return, while welcomed by many, is met with some resentment by others, who question why John was spared while their own loved ones had died. This weighs heavy on John's mind and he returns to the lake in search of a possible answer. He sees Tommy Shine sitting on a bench looking out over the lake and thanks him for saving his life. Tommy counters by admitting that he did not believe in God until after a series of protracted events since John's accident and that all Tommy did was pull him from the water.John reconciles his survival with a renewed sense of purpose in his life and rebuilds his relationships with those he had been alienating earlier. The movie ends with an epilogue that John is pursuing a career in ministry after graduation from high school."

She informs Haley about the impending category 5 Hurricane Wendy that is about to strike Florida. Beth expresses concern since she hasn't heard from their father, and she thinks he is still around the area. They have a slight argument since it appears that Haley took Dave's side in her parents' divorce, while Beth took their mother's side. Beth just asks that Haley get in touch with Dave.Haley starts to drive out of town as per evacuation notices, trying and failing to get in touch with Dave. She runs into an old friend/ex-boyfriend of Beth's named Wayne (Ross Anderson), who is attempting to direct traffic as the storm starts to hit.

The rest of the place is empty. Haley calls Beth to inform her, and Haley suggests that Dave is at their old family home. Haley heads there with Sugar against Beth's wishes, especially as the streets have started to fill up with water. When they get to the house, Haley doesn't find anyone upstairs. She calls his phone and finds it in the kitchen. His car is still in the garage. Alerted by Sugar's barking, Haley goes into the basement where she finds Dave unconscious and with a badly broken leg.

Pete is caught outside by another gator as well, and he is brutally torn to shreds by other gators joining in. Haley makes it to Dave's side and begins to cry, thinking they will die right there.

The film starts in a bar where a guy named Jeremy (Timothy Simons) is waiting for his date, a model-like blonde woman. Instead, he is met by con artist Penny Rust (Rebel Wilson). She pretends that the girl in the picture that Jeremy was waiting for is her sister who was too shy to meet him because she is ashamed of her small breasts, so Penny almost tricks Jeremy into giving her money for her ""sister's"" boob job. However, another guy that Penny swindled finds her in the bar with the cops, and she runs out of there, managing to hide among trash bags since her dress looks like one.Somewhere in France, a Danish man named Mathias (Casper Christensen) spots an American woman, Josephine Chesterfield (Anne Hathaway), sitting alone at a bar. He approaches her and hears her story about winning a lot of chips at the casino. Mathias offers to sell Josephine his mother's valuable bracelet, only for an Interpol officer, Brigitte Desjardins (Ingrid Oliver), to come by and say that Josephine is an international criminal and that she stole the chips from an old man. In reality, Brigitte and the old man, Albert (Nicholas Woodeson), are in cahoots with Josephine, who is really an English woman posing as a dim-witted American to try and con other men. She manages to swipe Mathias's bracelet and swap it with a fake.Josephine boards a train heading toward the French Riviera, where she spots Penny conning another guy by pretending that she is trying to come up with ransom money for her kidnapped sister. Josephine is impressed by how Penny makes the man buy her a bunch of food. The two then meet in another train car where Penny explains to Josephine that she exploits men who think women are too vulnerable or incapable of caring for themselves. Penny also mentions that she is traveling to the town of Beaumont-sur-Mer to con rich men, but since Josephine lives there and doesn't want competition, she tricks Penny into heading toward Port-au-Prince.After arriving in Beaumont-sur-Mer, Josephine sees that Penny made it there by tricking a guy named Gregor (John Hales). Josephine has Brigitte arrest Penny by having Gregor identify her while she uses his money to get some kind of water jet pack. While in prison, Josephine goes to Penny's cell and makes her think that Gregor is a member of the Russian mafia and that she will be killed on the outside. She forces Penny to fly back home, but on the plane, Penny is called to the bathroom to meet with Mathias, who tells her that Josephine is also a con artist and that she fooled her as well. Before Penny decides to fly back to meet Josephine, she and Mathias have sex in the bathroom.Penny makes it back to Josephine's home and requests that she teach her to be as good of a con artist as she is. Josephine agrees and shows Penny some of her tricks for fooling men, as well as other random tasks for self-defense. They start with a few practice targets, starting with a Southern tycoon named Howard Bacon (Dean Norris). Josephine gets him to propose marriage to her, on the condition that he meet her ""sister"". She then introduces Howard to Penny, who is made up to look like a repulsive hag. Howard leaves in disgust and leaves Josephine with the engagement ring.

Dismayed, Penny leaves Josephine, while also suspecting her of being a notorious con artist named Medusa.Josephine attempts to con an old man, only for Penny to come in and ruin everything.

They spot their mark, a young app creator named Thomas Westerburg (Alex Sharp), who is seemingly clumsy and gullible enough to fool.Josephine tries to catch Thomas at a table in the casino, but Penny comes in pretending to be blind and ends up getting Thomas's attention. The two sit together at another table where Penny tries to convince Thomas to cough up money for an operation for her eyes. Josephine sees that Penny is using her tricks, so she tries to use some of Penny's. Thomas appears to be a nice guy toward Penny, and he tells her how he wants to make improvements to his app in a way that his bosses may not approve of. He then goes to the bar to find a doctor that Penny made up, and Josephine assumes the role of said doctor so that he can try and get money out of him. He brings her back to the room to ""meet"" Penny, who is displeased to see her opponent there. Josephine puts her through some ""tests"" for her made-up condition, which is mostly meant to torture Penny.The ladies later end up at a nightclub with Thomas. Penny convinces a trio of women that she is blind and that Thomas is her ex who is now with her best friend, Josephine. Penny gets Thomas alone and finds out that Thomas doesn't own his company as she believed and that he is practically broke, but he would apparently be willing to pay the rest of his money for Penny's operation. Penny becomes endeared to Thomas and starts to fall for him, which also makes her feel guilty about conning him.Josephine finds Penny in her room, and Penny admits her feelings about Thomas to Josephine. Now that things have gotten personal, Josephine decides to make their bet interesting by seeing which one of them will win Thomas over first. Josephine leaves and also brings the three women from before to handle Penny for lying to them. She then goes to Thomas's room to try and seduce him, but he insists on keeping things professional for Penny's sake. However, before Josephine leaves, Thomas decides to turn the lights off.In the morning, Penny has to rip her hand off the wall since it was super-glued there.

Thomas goes to help her and sees that she is moving her eyes and is not blind, believing this to be the result of good medical treatment. The two then go to Thomas's private jet to say farewell. After it takes off, Josephine goes running after him yelling for the plane to stop. She explains to Penny that after the lights went out, Thomas showed her a PowerPoint presentation on his new app and then asked her to shower before taking her to bed, and then when she got out, all of her clothes and items were gone. Penny tells her that she gave Thomas back $500,000 that Josephine allegedly stole from him, only for Josephine to say that she gave him that much money to invest in his app, which means that Thomas ended up conning both women. He sends them a message revealing that he was Medusa.Sometime later, Penny is back near Josephine's home where she gives Penny some money for her hard work. They are then met by Thomas, who is giving a tour to a group of people. He approaches the ladies and says that he has made $6 million so far that year from his new app and he thanks them for it, before adding that the three of them would make a great team.

It's the Christmas season 2017 in London. Ever since recovering from a serious health issue which could have easily taken her life, that health issue which culminated on Christmas day last year, Kate, whose family emigrated from the former Yugoslavia in escaping the Baltic wars, is a changed person, and not for the better. Now irresponsible and self-absorbed, she is running out of friends' couches on which to sleep in they coming to final straws with her, this couch surfing which she still finds preferable to going home to her parents', especially in not wanting to deal with her tactless and overbearing mother. Working as a salesclerk at Yuletide, a year 'round Christmas store which is entering its busiest time of year, she is continually close to hitting final straws with her boss as well, a Chinese woman who has assumed the name Santa for the business and who only keeps Kate on in remembering back to the time when she was an asset to the business. Kate now aspires to a life as a performer in musical theater, she working under the misguided belief that her chutzpah alone will get her work. Within this situation, Kate meets Tom, who she believes is coming on to her, she putting him off in he not being her type. But persisting, he ends up showing Kate another side of London and another side of life. But as Kate begins to have feelings for him and sees him as an important emotional support for her, he, whose intentions he admits are not romantic, begins to be harder and harder to find, all she knowing about him being that he volunteers in the night shift at a homeless shelter. In the two having some sort of bond, the question then becomes if they will ever come into sync together, factoring into the equation the reason for Tom's persistence with her in the first place.—Huggo Yugoslavia, 1999The Andrich family is having a Christmas service where little Katarina (Madison Ingoldsby) is singing in the choir. Her parents Petra (Emma Thompson) and Ivan (Boris Isakovic), plus Katarina's older sister Marta (Lucy Miller) watch and admire her singing, while Marta is admiring one of the other choir girls.London, England 2017Katarina now goes by Kate (now an adult played by Emilia Clarke).

While at work, Marta visits Kate and forces her to step outside and talk to their mom, even though Kate doesn't want to. Later on, Kate meets a man named Tom Webster (Henry Golding). Kate finds him charming, if not a bit odd. Their moment is then ruined by a bird pooping on Kate's face.Outside of work, Kate tries to crash with her friend Jenna (Ritu Arya) and her husband Rufus (Ansu Kabia), the latter not being too fond of Kate after she accidentally burned his model ship. Kate tries to make an audition for a theater production, but she arrives late and is forced to sing a Capella, and the judges dismiss her.At the shop, a Danish man (Peter Mygind) enters. He and Santa appear to share a connection, which Kate notices. She later leaves work after accepting an invite to go out with Tom. They go out on the town, which proves to be fun for Kate. She learns that Tom volunteers at a homeless shelter in his spare time. The night ends with them entering an ice skating rink. They have a good time until a security guard kicks them out.In the morning, Kate goes to the shop to find that it was broken into. Kate realizes she forgot to properly lock up before going out with Tom. Santa already knew this and says she broke a window to make it look like a break-in just for the insurance. She scolds Kate and says she is going to give her another chance even though she shouldn't. To make matters more complicated, Jenna and Rufus kick Kate out after one too many screw-ups.On another outing with Tom, the two end up going back to his place. Kate tells him about an illness she had in which she required a heart transplant and it made her feel bad about herself, in that she was ""half-dead"" due to needing help. Kate then asks Tom to kiss her goodnight, which he does. However, when she tries to see him again, Tom tells her that she cannot keep being dependent on him, which just makes her upset.Kate joins her family for dinner. Marta makes things tense by suggesting that Kate always acts helpless after the illness, while Kate outs Marta by saying that she has a girlfriend named Alba (Jade Anouka). Petra and Ivan are also called out for, respectively, being smothering and also barely being home since Ivan works as a cab driver, but Kate thinks he takes the hours that he does to get away from his family.Kate goes to the homeless shelter to look for Tom. One of the men working there doesn't appear to know who Kate is talking about. She ends up getting roped into volunteering and helping out, and later even sets up a bucket outside while dressed as an elf to sing Christmas carols.Kate starts to try and do right by other people, starting with her family. She apologizes to Marta and finally meets Alba, albeit under tense circumstances. Marta forgives her sister. Later on the bus, Kate sees a Yugoslavian couple get harassed by a racist guy. Kate sits by them and speaks to them in their native tongue, telling them that they are welcome there, and she introduces herself as Katarina. She even does better at work and bonds with Santa, who tells her that she only uses that nickname for whatever job she has, as nobody else is going to know how to pronounce her name. Additionally, she tells Kate that she is seeing the Danish man, but since she can't pronounce his name either, she simply refers to him as ""Boy"".Kate later goes by Tom's apartment to visit him. She meets a Realtor who is putting the place up on the market. Kate thinks Tom is selling the place, but the Realtor informs her that the previous owner has been dead for months. He mentions that his name was ""Webster,"" and that he passed away a year ago. We see a flashback in which Tom rode his bike through the streets and was hit by a truck. As he was a donor, his heart was transplanted to Kate. In other words, LAST CHRISTMAS, Tom gave Kate his heart. Kate is devastated and sits by the bench that she frequented with Tom, which turns out to be a memorial for him. Tom's spirit visits Kate one last time to give her reassurance that she will be fine.Sometime later, Kate has helped put on a Christmas show with the help of the patrons of the homeless shelter. She wears a festive dress as her family comes to see her, and they all perform ""Last Christmas."""
Jojo Rabbit,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2584384/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young German boy in the Hitler Youth whose hero and imaginary friend is the country's dictator is shocked to discover that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. A World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism.—Fox Searchlight Pictures 1944 Germany. Ten year old Johannes Betzler, more commonly called Jojo, is the son of good Germans, his father away fighting in Italy, while he is under the care of his mother Rosie, with his older sister Inge recently having passed away from illness. With only one true friend in the form of same aged, bespectacled Yorki, Jojo, in wanting to fit in, is arguably entering what he would consider the most important phase of his young life in attending a Nazi youth camp presided over by Captain Klenzendorf, Captain K's almost too faithful assistant Freddy Finkel, and Fräulein Rahm, who takes Nazi policies in a slightly off-kilter direction. Despite being considered an outsider by most of the other youth in town, Jojo figures he has a leg up on everyone else at camp in that he is constantly being guided by the spirit of Der Führer himself,Adolf Hitler, whose personal bodyguard Jojo aspires to be when he grows up. In his general day-to-day life but also supported by his time at camp, Jojo has a hatred for Jewish people despite not really knowing anything about them or ever having met anyone of the Jewish faith, the ultimate goal to kill them. So when Jojo meets someone Jewish for the first time, especially as that meeting is in what is for him the most unlikely of circumstances, Jojo has to figure out what to do. While truly believing he is a Nazi despite not really knowing what that means, he has to decide either to follow what he has been taught in hating and trying to kill any Jewish person despite knowing that killing is not in his true nature, or not, which may have larger consequences with relation to family. While he decides, he truly gets to know the person beyond the label of ""Jewish"" which may factor into what happens.—Huggo Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany during the later stages of World War II with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). His absent father is supposedly serving on the Italian Front but has lost all contact and his older sister Inge has recently died of influenza. The jingoistic Jojo often talks with his imaginary friend, a supportive but childish version of Adolf Hitler.Jojo and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) attend a Deutsches Jungvolk Hitler Youth training camp, run by the one-eyed Wehrmacht Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he tries to release it and runs off crying after the other boys taunt him with the name ""Jojo Rabbit"". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns and throws a Stielhandgranate without permission. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, Rosie asks Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading propaganda leaflets throughout town, and collecting scrap metal for the war effort.Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), a teenage Hebrew girl and his late sister's former classmate, hiding upstairs. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the Gestapo, but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her. He agrees to keep her safe, on the condition she reveals her ""Hebrew secrets"" so he can write a book for Klenzendorf, which amuses him. Elsa plays along by making up stories about Hebrew powers, such as mind-reading. Angry with his mother for hiding a Hebrew but unable to reveal his knowledge of Elsa, Jojo accuses Rosie of being unpatriotic and laments that his father is away. Rosie dismisses his accusations and espouses her belief that positive thoughts and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression.Jojo continues to interrogate Elsa, learning she has a boyfriend called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Jojo forges a letter from ""Nathan"" which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Hearing her crying, Jojo writes another letter retracting the first one. Jojo and Adolf argue, with Adolf insisting Elsa is a monster. Later, while on one of his metal collecting trips, Jojo spots his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" message in town.
Jojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz (Stephen Merchant), visit his house. Klenzendorf also happens to arrive at the house while it is being searched. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be Inge, and produces Inge's papers and confirms her birthday from memory to quell the Gestapo's suspicions. Jojo is relieved, but Elsa later realizes she recited the wrong date and Klenzendorf covered for her, but is certain the Gestapo will eventually realize the deception. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square. Devastated, he returns home and stabs Elsa in the shoulder, then breaks down; Elsa comforts him.Jojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him Hitler has committed suicide and that the Allies are closing in. Jojo encounters Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), arming and sacrificing children as the battle rages, and she gives him a soldier's coat, before being killed herself in an explosion. Facing the American and Soviet forces, the city's garrison surrenders. The Soviets force several captured Germans into a backyard, including Jojo. A wounded Klenzendorf tells Jojo his mother was a good woman, and saves him by removing his coat, calling him a Hebrew, and spitting on him, leading the Soviet guards to drag him away. The soldiers expel Jojo, who runs away as shots are heard.Jojo runs home and, to stop Elsa leaving, tells her Germany won the war. Recognizing her despair, he recites a new ""letter"" from her boyfriend claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that her boyfriend died the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him in a ""little brother"" way. A disheveled Adolf angrily confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Jojo takes Elsa outside, where she realizes the Allies have won after seeing American soldiers. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street."

The two of them have a laugh as Nels admits to being tired of hitting Santa, right before he shoots Santa in the head. He joins Speedo and Limbo at the bottom of the gorge as well, and Nels plows his car off the road. Nels goes home and sees that Grace has left him.Nels pays a visit to his brother Byron (William Forsythe), who was once part of the criminal world and was known as ""Wingman"". His wife Ahn (Elizabeth Thai) immediately dislikes Nels, thinking he is part of the same crew Byron used to hang with. Byron makes a call and learns about the business that Kyle and Dante were involved in, and he tells Nels about Viking and how dangerous he is.Viking suspects the disappearances of his men are the work of an American Indian drug gang of which their leader, White Bull (Tom Jackson), had made a compromise with Viking's own father when they took over the area on the reservation. Viking orders two of his men to apprehend White Bull's son Little Hawk after he returns from the airport. After beating Little Hawk senseless, he never tells them anything, and Viking executes him. He has Little Hawk's body hung up by a sign near the reservation for his father to find, along with the shark tooth that White Bull gave Viking's father as a peace offering. White Bull now wants revenge against Viking, specifically ""a son for a son"".Byron suggests to Nels that he hire a hitman called The Eskimo (Arnold Pinnock) to kill Viking. Nels follows Byron's instructions on how to do business with The Eskimo, being that he must pick him up from a train station, take him to a motel, and pay half the money upfront. When Nels does all of that, The Eskimo suspects Nels of being a cop since cops do that ""half upfront"" deal instead of two-thirds upfront. The Eskimo later goes to Viking's place and explicitly tells him that a man by the name of Coxman hired him to kill Viking, and he wants to make a bigger payday by working with Viking. The crooks believe Coxman is Byron, as they remember him as Wingman. Viking refuses to do work with The Eskimo as he did not honor his code by carrying out the job, so he has his men kill The Eskimo.Viking and two of his men drive to Byron's home and pick him up. They still think he was the one who sent The Eskimo after him. Byron knows what is going to happen, but since he is already suffering from cancer, he could not care less that he is about to be murdered. Viking respects Byron's spirit before he is executed. Nels and Ahn later visit Byron's grave, but Ahn spits on it and walks away with her luggage.Meanwhile, Kim has been doing her own investigation into the case after gathering info from around town, as well as an ex-boyfriend of hers. She learns that Dante has also died from an overdose, as well as the names of people involved in both Viking's and White Bull's operations.Viking attempts to pin the blame of Little Hawk's murder on one of his goons, Dexter (Benjamin Hollingsworth). Viking shoots Dexter in the head and orders his men to decapitate him and bring the head to White Bull as an offering. He sends his man Sly (David O'Hara) to deliver the head and say that Dexter was the one who killed Little Hawk. White Bull is thankful for the offering, but he still demands a son for a son, and he kills Sly as well.White Bull orders his men to kidnap Ryan in retaliation for Little Hawk's murder. They attempt to get him during the week that Aya has custody of him. However, Nels catches wind of this and poses as someone working for Ryan's parents and he picks him up from school. Nels manages to lose White Bull's men from his trail before taking Ryan to his home. The boy is not scared as Nels is friendly to him, and Ryan is already a good-natured kid. Nels puts Ryan to bed, but he asks Nels to tell him a story before he goes to sleep. He bonds with the boy better than his own father does.Aya confronts Viking after she believed that he kidnapped Ryan to assert authority. Viking thinks the Indians took Ryan and just didn't call, which he says is what they must do in the event of a kidnapping. His men later bring in a janitor from Ryan's school, who says he saw Nels taking Ryan, and he mentions the name Coxman. Viking makes it look like the men will give the janitor the money he was promised, but he just has his men kill him.Nels lures Viking and his men toward his job. He hides Ryan as he attempts to kill Viking, but a bodyguard blocks Nels's shot. One of Viking's men finds Nels and brings him out at gunpoint. As Viking demands to know where Ryan is, the Indians arrive and engage in a shootout with Viking's men. Most men on both sides are killed, but Viking attempts to escape in his car. Nels operates a machine to cut a tree and drive it through Viking's car. This leaves Viking trapped, and White Bull shoots Viking in the chest. Nels starts to leave, but White Bull forces him to let him join him.Later that night, Kim and Gip come across the scene. Viking is still alive until Gip finds him, and he finally dies. Ryan then gets out and drives the snowplow away from the scene, and the officers must follow him.In the final scene, Nels and White Bull ride along the snowy roads as Nels just continues to do his job. As they ride together, White Bull's last surviving man, Avalanche (Mitchell Saddleback), is paragliding and accidentally flies into the path of the snowplow, causing him to get shredded."

On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless: mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and tween Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death. Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying.

There, Dan catches the eye of the mysterious Abra Stone, an extraordinary teenager gifted with far more superior shining abilities. As their unbreakable telepathic bond attracts unwanted attention, the semi-eternal psychic vampire, Rose the Hat, and her marauding gang of followers known as ""The True Knot"" close in on the innocent and their life-giving essence. Once more, the snow-covered purgatory's restless spirits invite Dan over for one last winter.

The girl then notices other people lurking nearby, watching them. Rose tells Violet that she has a bit of magic in her, right before she and all the other people in the woods converge on Violet.Elsewhere, Danny Torrance (Roger Dale Floyd) is still getting over the trauma from his ordeal at the Overlook Hotel. His mother, Wendy (Alex Essoe), has become concerned since he hasn't spoken since their time there, but he still has nightmares of the spirits from the hotel, such as the Grady Twins and the Bathtub Lady from Room 237. As part of his ""shine"" powers, Danny can see spirits like Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly). He shows Danny a trick to keeping evil spirits away by showing him a box that he can use to trap them. Wendy then runs out to find Danny on the bench, but nobody is next to him.That night, Danny and Wendy are watching TV together. Danny excuses himself to go to the bathroom, where the Bathtub Lady is waiting for him. He uses a box in his mind and manages to trap her inside. He returns to his mother and starts talking to her again.Jump to 2011, where Dan (now played by Ewan McGregor) lives in New Jersey and is an alcoholic.

Rose and her right-hand man, Crow Daddy (Zahn McClarnon), are watching her from a distance. Andi is able to manipulate others to do what she says before leaving a cut on his cheek, resembling a snake bite. Impressed, Rose catches Andi outside the theater and takes her with her and Crow. They take her to their hideout, where Rose tells Andi that she has special powers that work in favor of their cult, The True Knot. Rose nicknames her ""Snakebite Andi"" and promises her that they can ""eat well, stay young, and live long.""Anniston, New HampshireAbra Stone is celebrating her 5th birthday.

He meets and befriends a local man named Billy Freeman (Cliff Curtis), to whom Dan admits he is running away from something. Dan finds a place to stay, with Billy vouching for him to the landlord.That night, Rose brings Andi out by the beach for a ceremony. The eldest True Knot member, Grampa Flick (Carel Struycken), leads the ceremony. Rose pulls out a canister containing the shine of Violet, presented as some kind of powerful steam. Rose feeds Violet's shine to Andi while the other True Knot members get their share of it. Andi writhes and screams until she has absorbed the shine.Dan has a nightmare in which he sees a spirit sleeping next to him. He goes to Billy for help, and he brings Dan to an AA meeting. After the meeting, Dan is introduced to Dr. John Dalton (Bruce Greenwood). Dan notices Dalton clutching his wrist, and then approaches him by saying that he left his watch in a bathroom, which is something only Dalton would have known. Astonished by Dan's insight, and influenced by Billy's good word, Dalton gives Dan a job working at the hospice, as he has some experience as an orderly.During one night shift, Dan is mopping the floors when he notices the hospice's cat, Azzie, going into the room of an elderly man. The man knows that whenever Azzie goes into someone's room and sits on their bed, it's because Azzie knows that person is going to die. The man appears frightened at first until Dan reassures him telepathically that dying is just like going to sleep. Comforted, the man nicknames Dan, ""Doctor Sleep."" Within moments, the older man is gone, indicated by his breath leaving his body. When Dan returns home, he finds ""Hello"" written on his wall, with a smiley face in the O. He simply writes back, ""Hi.""Eight years later, in present-day 2019, Dan has remained sober. During a meeting, he discusses his feelings with never having known his father, only feeling close to him whenever he drank. It made him realize that his father fought the same battle he did, but Dan has chosen to come out better. He continues his work as an orderly to tend to patients who are about to die. He also maintains contact with Abra (now played by Kyleigh Curran).The True Knot hasn't had a good feed in a while, relying mostly on leftovers from kids with shines that aren't as powerful. They track a young baseball player, Bradley Trevor (Jacob Tremblay), whose shine helps him out during games. The True Knot follows him home, and Andi makes him get in their van. They take him to a secluded area where they pin him down and brutally murder him, feasting on his dying screams. Abra senses the murder and begins screaming in her home, crying to her parents that the boy has been killed. Rose is able to sense Abra's presence there as well, referring to her as a ""looker."" At this time, Dan sees ""REDRUM"" written on his wall. He asks Abra ""Who,"" and she writes back ""Baseball Boy."" The True Knot then buries Bradley in a shallow grave.Abra does some research into Bradley's disappearance. At school, she is able to hear the thoughts of her classmates. When she gets home to her room, she has visions of the True Knot and their whereabouts. She looks outside her window and floats briefly as she is connected to Rose, who is at a supermarket. Rose manages to see Abra and come into contact with her, but Abra expels Rose from her head, which causes a strong enough push to send Rose across the floor. She is amazed by this power, but also threatened by it. Rose brings this information back to Crow, stating that her shine might be too powerful for the True Knot, and so they must destroy her.Dan and Abra eventually find each other and explain their gifts to one another, which Dan calls ""The Shining,"" or ""Tony"" since he thought it was like having an imaginary friend. Abra thought Dan was her imaginary friend. After she tells him about the True Knot, he warns her against using her shine in any way that could attract their attention.At night while at work, Dan follows Azzie into a bedroom where he reencounters Dick for the first time since childhood. He warns Dan about what the True Knot really does and also urges him to protect Abra since they share a connection. Dick also lets Dan know that this will be the last time he sees him.Rose meditates and manages to get into Abra's head while she's asleep. She finds what looks like filing cabinets and tries digging through them, but Abra anticipated Rose would come back, so she traps her hand in the drawer, causing Rose to tear her skin as she pulls her hand out. She snaps back to her regular body and sees her injury followed her. She reports to the others that Abra set a trap for her, and so it is now clear that she has to be killed. Crow then informs Rose that Grampa Flick is ""cycling."" Too weakened to keep going, he convulses until he decays, and the cult absorbs his steam.Abra makes contact with Dan again and asks for his help in finding Bradley's body since she can locate the cult if she touches his baseball glove. With Billy's help, Dan is guided by Abra to the site where the boy's body is buried. Dan and Billy dig up the body, horrified and physically repulsed at the discovery. They take the glove back to Abra's house, but Dave has learned about Abra's contact with ""Uncle Dan"" and thinks Dan is some kind of creep. After explaining everything to Dave and revealing their powers to him, Abra manages to track the cult and deduces their destination.Dan and Billy go into the woods to bait the cult using Abra, who is appearing from her kitchen. Dan and Billy hide and begin shooting at the cult members, and Rose feels the pain as each of them are killed off one by one. Billy shoots Andi, but she uses her last breaths to manipulate Billy into fatally shooting himself in the head. Meanwhile, Crow kills Dave and abducts Abra. Dan returns home and is able to link his mind to Abra's and briefly possesses her. Together, they cause Crow to steer into a tree, and since he wasn't wearing his seat belt, he's ejected through the windshield and is killed instantly.Dan drives up and locates Abra. They then drive off to make their last stand at the now rundown and condemned Overlook Hotel. Dan walks through the building where his lifelong trauma was born. He finds Room 237, still with the ax markings left by Jack. Dan walks to the mezzanine and meets the bartender, Lloyd (Henry Thomas), who bears a striking resemblance to Jack, though he insists he is just Lloyd. Dan recounts how Wendy died when he was 20, and how he knew she was dying due to the flies that he would see around anyone who was close to death. Lloyd then drops the facade and channels Jack before downing the drink he offered Dan. Rose soon arrives, and Dan and Abra team up to trap Rose in the icy hedge maze. Abra manages to wound Rose by cutting her legs, but Rose overpowers them and breaks free. Abra runs while Dan faces Rose. She gets into his mind and sees all the fear and trauma he endured in that hotel, which allows her to start absorbing his shine. Rose then sees the boxes of the Overlook spirits and thinks they contain more power, but Dan instead unleashes them to use against Rose. The Grady Twins, Bathtub Lady, and other spirits surround Rose and consume her shine, destroying her for good. But they soon turn their attention to Dan and possess him. He finds Abra, but she is able to tap in and reach Dan, saying he made a stop to the boiler room. Knowing what is going to happen, Dan sends Abra out as he takes the spirits with him to the boiler room to let the Overlook finally go up in flames, while Abra watches outside.Sometime later, Abra continues to communicate with Dan's spirit. When her mother asks her about it, she at first denies anything, but then admits she was talking to Dan as well as her father. Lucy appears okay with Abra's powers. Before they watch TV together, Abra excuses herself to go to the bathroom. The Bathtub Lady is in there waiting for her, but Abra is already one step ahead of her."

As he is in the middle of reluctantly getting a swastika tattoo on his arm, some of the members quickly discover that Fred writes expository pieces for a news site, The Brooklyn Advocate, and that he is also Jewish. Fred grabs his phone that has been recording them the whole time and leaps out a window, hitting a car outside as he lands, but still managing to hold onto his phone and he gets away.In the next scene, we meet Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) as she enters a meeting with President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk), an actor who actually did play the POTUS on TV before going into politics. He tells Charlotte he wants to transition from TV roles to film, and he is looking for a replacement, despite only being in the middle of his first term. Charlotte smooth-talks her way to convince Chambers that endorsing a female candidate for president would leave him with a great legacy before leaving, and so he decides to give her his endorsement. Charlotte soon meets with her staffers Maggie (June Diane Raphael), Tom (Ravi Patel), and polling team manager Katherine (Lisa Kudrow) to help Charlotte with her campaign.Fred brings his piece on white supremacy to his boss (Randall Park), who tells Fred that The Advocate has been bought out by billionaire media mogul Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis). Fred hates Wembley and everything he represents, and Fred feels that he would turn their paper into a propaganda machine. He promptly quits, in spite of knowing he has no job prospects.Fred calls his best friend Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to cheer him up. Lance, who is a manager in his company, leaves for the day to help his buddy. That night, they attend an event to see Boyz II Men. It turns out that Charlotte is also there with Maggie and Tom. She and Fred spot each other among the crowd, but Fred freaks out upon seeing Charlotte. He goes outside where Lance follows him and asks how he knows her. Fred admits that Charlotte was his babysitter when he was 13 and she was 16, and he had a huge crush on her. He has an unfortunate memory of listening to her recite a speech for her campaign for class presidency, but he got overzealous and kissed her, which led to him getting an erection in front of her and her awkwardly telling him it's fine, right before her boyfriend came in and made fun of Fred's erection. He also later learned that Charlotte lost to a guy who ran on a two-prom system. Charlotte's bodyguard then steps outside to tell Fred that Charlotte wants to see him. The two chat as she remembers Fred, but they are interrupted by Wembley. After Charlotte leaves, Fred confronts Wembley and makes his hatred for him known, just moments before he trips and falls all the way down the stairs. And the video of him doing that goes viral.On the way back from the event, Charlotte tells Maggie and Tom how she knew Fred, and Tom mentions he likes some of what Fred has written. Charlotte then considers Fred to be her speechwriter since she thinks he's a good writer and could potentially bring a boost to her campaign. Maggie later gives Fred a call and invites him to join them and he agrees. He is soon picked up and taken to Washington D.C.Fred meets with Charlotte as she is preparing to go to an environmental summit to pitch an initiative to lend a hand in helping the planet, while also seeing it as her opportunity to launch her 2020 presidential campaign. Fred is hesitant as he is not sure whether or not Charlotte's plan will work, but she is very confident that it will, and so he joins the team.On their trip, Fred gives Charlotte a speech and adds tips on how she can seem more accessible to voters. They arrive in Sweden for the summit, where Fred is forced to wear a traditional Swedish men's suit that makes him look ridiculous. He finds out from Maggie that Charlotte has to change things in the speech, so he makes a scene trying to run and get the laptop to prevent her from doing so, only to toss his own laptop into the snow. Charlotte comes out to confront him for his behavior, but Fred asserts that this is what he was hoping to avoid when he signed on, since he wanted to work for someone who stuck to their guns. Charlotte argues that she has to play by the rules in order to keep herself in the game. Eventually, Charlotte delivers her speech without changing a thing, and it is a hit.Fred stays on Charlotte's campaign tour as he continues to write for her, and they start to get closer as they learn more about each other. They are in Buenos Aires one night where they appear to get closer and more intimately, but they are interrupted when insurgents begin attacking outside. Charlotte and Fred are brought by her security detail to a private bunker. Fred freaks out, but Charlotte teaches him a breathing technique to calm him down. They sit next to each other where they kiss before a guard comes to get them.

During an event, Charlotte is courted by Canadian Prime Minister James Steward (Alexander Skarsgard), who is said by Charlotte's staff to be a viable bachelor. However, Charlotte finds Fred outside and the two share a private dance.Charlotte is later contacted by Chambers, who wants her to shut down her environmental initiative since he is partnering with Wembley, and it's an issue that he is not concerned with. She vents about this to Fred and asks that he help her get fucked up to let off steam. He takes her out to drink and get high off of molly, but Charlotte is soon called to handle a hostage negotiation despite being very high. Charlotte comes in with a relaxed demeanor and talks to the captor over the phone, relating to him on a personal level about how they don't want to deal with their pain-in-the-ass bosses. The negotiation is a success, which does wonders for Charlotte's numbers. During a televised speech, she lies and says that Chambers signed off on her initiative.Charlotte is brought in to meet with Chambers and Wembley following her TV appearance. Clearly not happy over what she said, they decide to blackmail her with a hacked video from Fred's webcam showing him talking to her about a speech before he starts masturbating and then ejaculates in his beard. Charlotte brings this news to Fred and mentions being blackmailed. Not only do Chambers and Wembley want Charlotte to go by their desires, but they want to give Fred an image overhaul so that he won't embarrass Charlotte. She also considers dropping her initiative if it means she has a better chance of winning. He doesn't want to go through with it despite Charlotte insisting that it's how she will win. They can't come to an agreement, so they break up.Fred goes back to Lance after his break-up and learns that Lance is a Republican and Christian after Fred mocks them. Fred reacts with disgust, but Lance calls him out and says that he didn't bring this up to him because he knew he would react that way, and it is his narrow-minded way of thinking that hurt his relationship with Charlotte. Meanwhile, Charlotte attempts to spend time with Steward for publicity, but he turns out to be charmless.Charlotte is up to give a speech during a conference. As she starts, she seems to go with Chambers's plan, but she realizes that her younger self would be disappointed in her for not sticking to her beliefs, and so she calls out both Chambers and Wembley, calling them idiots and talking about the jerk-off video in full detail before they put it online, but Wembley orders the video to be put up anyway. Charlotte's speech earns her applause before she is driven to meet with Fred. They reconcile and kiss before finally going public with their relationship, and they are warmly welcomed by the public.Sometime later, Charlotte is sworn in as the first female president of the USA, with Fred being her ""First Mister"" (or ""First Man""). Although he continues to be unfiltered around her, he vows to stay by her side and support her throughout her presidency."
Child's Play,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8663516/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mother gives her 13-year-old son a toy doll for his birthday, unaware of its more sinister nature. After moving to a new city, young Andy Barclay receives a special present from his mother -- a seemingly innocent Buddi doll that becomes his best friend. When the doll suddenly takes on a life of its own, Andy unites with other neighborhood children to stop the sinister toy from wreaking bloody havoc. The toy Buddi with Artificial Intelligence is the great sensation of the Kaslan Industries. When a programmer is fired by his supervisor in a Vietnam factory, he cancels the security protocols of one toy and then he commits suicide. The mother of the lonely thirteen year-old Andy Barclay gives a Buddi to him for his birthday and the toy becomes his best friend. But soon Andy notes that something is wrong with his Buddi and together with his new friends Falyn and Pugg, they try to stop him.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The movie starts with an ad for the Buddi dolls, made by major tech developer Kaslan Industries. The Buddis can connect to the owners' electronics system and adapt to their routines to help them in their day-to-day lives. It is set to be a major seller.At the Kaslan factory in Vietnam, the manager berates one of his employees for slacking on the job. He fires him but also orders him to finish the doll that he has been working on. Out of spite, the employee programs the doll to have all of its safety functions turned off. After sending the doll out for distribution, the employee jumps out a window and lands on his boss's car.In Chicago, we meet Karen Barclay (Aubrey Plaza) as she works at her job, ZedMart, where a customer is complaining that the Buddi doll he ordered isn't blonde like his kid wanted. Karen clarifies that it's because the doll they are looking for is the Buddi 2 that hasn't come out yet. Karen goes home to her son, Andy (Gabriel Bateman), who wears a hearing aid. They have settled into a new apartment, and Andy is pretty lonely with no friends. Making things more difficult is that Karen is dating Shane (David Lewis), whom Andy sees as a jerk. Karen and Andy also meet their neighbor, Detective Mike Norris (Brian Tyree Henry), who lives with his mother Doreen (Carlease Burke).At work, a customer brings back a defective Buddi doll (the same one from before) after complaining that its eyes were glowing red. Karen's boss Wes (Amro Majzoub) plans to send the doll back so that it can be compacted, but Karen wants to take it home for Andy. When Wes refuses to give it up, Karen blackmails him by reminding Wes that he cheated on his wife, so he lets her have it. Karen brings the doll home as an early birthday gift for Andy, but he doesn't seem interested in it. Andy turns the doll on, and it starts to speak to him. He tries to name it, but the doll refers to itself as Chucky (voice of Mark Hamill).Andy has a hard time getting Chucky to do what his functions are supposed to do. He gets commands wrong and inadvertently creeps Andy out by waking him up at night. However, Andy finds that he can talk to Chucky about his feelings toward his mom dating Shane, and Chucky forms a genuine attachment to Andy. He starts to teach Chucky how to scare Shane by showing him how to make creepy faces. Chucky does so, but his recording device also plays back Andy's words about Shane, which makes him mad when he hears them and gets Andy in trouble with Karen.On one occasion, Andy's cat Rooney scratches him. Seeing that Rooney hurt Andy, Chucky begins to strangle the cat until Andy stops him.Andy befriends two other kids from his building - Falyn (Beatrice Kitsos) and Pugg (Ty Consiglio). They hang out after they see that Chucky is different from the other Buddi dolls (mainly that he mimics Pugg swearing). The kids watch one of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movies, and Chucky begins to imitate Leatherface's movements by walking toward Pugg menacingly with a knife, before Andy once again has to stop Chucky from hurting anyone.Andy comes home from school one afternoon and finds that Chucky stabbed Rooney to death for seeing him as a threat to Andy. The boy tearfully tosses his cat down the garbage chute and has to hide from Karen that the doll killed the cat. Chucky tries to make it up by frightening Shane again, but as he plays back Andy calling Shane an asshole, the man goes to Andy's room to confront him about leaving Chucky around, and to state his problem like a man. Andy is left crying and saying how he wishes Shane would go away. Chucky hears the request, and his eyes glow red as he forms a sinister smirk.Shane later goes home after arguing with Karen, where it is revealed that he is already married with two kids. He goes outside to take down some Christmas lights, only for Chucky to knock his ladder over and causes him to land on his feet, painfully shattering his legs. With the lights wrapped around him, Chucky gets a tiller and turns it on, which pulls Shane toward it and then scalps him. Chucky then proceeds to slash Shane up. The next morning, Mike and his partner come across the scene to see that Shane's face has been removed. Karen is later informed, and she learns about his other family.Andy is given another unwelcome surprise when he goes into his room and finds that Chucky left him a melon with Shane's skinned face on it as a gift. He plays back the sound of Andy wishing Shane was gone, so he gets Falyn and Pugg and convinces them that Chucky needs to be destroyed. They hold Chucky down, and Andy pulls out his main core before they dispose of him. They then try to get rid of the Shane melon by wrapping it in gift paper to throw down the garbage chute. Unfortunately, they are spotted by Karen, and when Andy says its a gift for Doreen, Karen offers to escort them over to give it to her. Before she can unwrap it, Andy tells her that he would like for her to open it at his birthday in a few days, to which Doreen agrees.Chucky is found by the building's electrician/peeping tom Gabe (Trent Redekop), who brings the doll to his little workshop where he puts a new core inside Chucky, with plans to resell him for a lot of money. Gabe then starts to leer at Karen in her bathroom, when the electrical items in the room start to flicker. Chucky starts to reawaken, and he manages to hack into other Kaslan electronic products. He starts to torment Gabe, until he gets him to hang above a buzz saw. Chucky raises the heat on the pole that Gabe is holding onto until it gets so hot that Gabe falls groin-first onto the saw and is dismembered.Andy later finds that another boy from his building, Omar (Marlon Kazadi), has found Chucky, but he's calling him ""Chode"". Andy tries to get him back from Omar, but when he refuses, they start to fight until they are pulled off each other. Andy finds Omar's phone and uses the Buddi app to keep an eye on his friends. He sees through Chucky's eyes that Pugg has expressed doubts to Falyn about being friends with Andy.Andy and Karen later go to the Norris apartment for dinner. While there, Chucky is nearby and overhears Doreen refer to Andy as her ""new best friend."" When everyone else is out of the room, Andy manages to get the Shane melon away from the apartment and throw it down the garbage chute.Doreen later goes outside and is picked up by a self-driving Kaslan car. She is driven around near the supermarket, until the car starts going out of control, as it is manipulated by Chucky. He causes the car to crash before he breaks in and stabs Doreen in the chest. Mike later comes across his mother's body and weeps before he later finds out that the Shane melon was discovered in the chute, and he recognizes the wrapping paper around it.Karen learns that Andy took Omar's phone, and he tries to convince her that Chucky is behind all the recent string of incidents, but she doesn't believe him and takes him to work with her. At the same time, Falyn and Pugg learn about Doreen's death and suspect that Andy was right about Chucky.At ZedMart, customers are gathered as the Buddi 2 is about to launch. They storm in like Black Friday as the dolls go on sale, but as Wes comes out in a Buddi costume, he is stabbed in the neck by Chucky. His costume head comes off, and his blood is sprayed all over a terrified little girl. The lights in the store then go out as Chucky takes over all the electronics in the store. He sends drones out after people, and one of them finishes Wes off by slicing into him. The other customers start running around in a panic, and the other Buddi dolls start to come to life. Andy is helped by Falyn, Pugg, and Omar, but Mike shows up and tries to arrest Andy after suspecting him of being involved in Doreen and Shane's deaths. He soon sees that Chucky is responsible, but Mike gets cut by a drone after saving one of the kids. After taking out several dolls, Andy is faced with Chucky, who says that if he can't be his friend, nobody can. He then reveals that he has Karen tied up and is going to hang her. As Chucky goes for Andy, the boy starts to sing ""The Buddi Song"" that Chucky sang earlier, in an attempt to talk him down. It works long enough for Andy to knock Chucky off of him and go save his mom, but Chucky gets up and attacks Andy again. Andy manages to free Karen before grabbing Chucky's knife and sticking it into his core, seemingly shutting him down for good. But when Andy goes to his mom, Chucky lunges toward him until he is shot by Mike. Karen then finishes off the evil doll by ripping his head off. Medics arrive for Karen and Mike, while Andy and his friends destroy Chucky's remains in an alley.An announcement is made by Kaslan's CEO Henry Kaslan (Tim Matheson), who issues a statement about the Buddi dolls' programming.

Ready or Not,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7798634/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game. All of us have made certain efforts so our in-laws will like us, but Grace is going to have to give it her all if she wants to fit in with her brand new husband's wealthy dynasty, who require her to follow a brutal tradition: for the bride to try to survive her wedding night while the rest of them hunt her down. The class struggle stuff hits the proverbial fan in this extremely black satire starring a brilliantSamara Weavingand including an uncommonly perverseAndie MacDowell.—Sitges Film Festival Grace couldn't be happier after she marries the man of her dreams at his family's luxurious estate. There's just one catch-she must now hide from midnight until dawn while her new in-laws hunt her down with guns, crossbows and other weapons. As Grace desperately tries to survive the night, she soon finds a way to turn the tables on her not-so-lovable relatives.—krmanirethnam After an elegant nuptial ceremony at the lavish manor of the uber-wealthy Le Domas clan, the gentle groom, Alex Le Domas, informs his blissful young bride, Grace, that the ceremony is far from over yet, and there's still a long night ahead of them. Before long, as part of a macabre long-standing family tradition, Grace will have to play a seemingly innocent game, and hide somewhere in the vast mansion's cavernous halls and labyrinthine corridors, until dawn. Now, whether Grace is ready or not, the armed-to-the-teeth Domases are coming for her, and it's going to get ugly. Will the newlywed quarry survive the relentless onslaught of the nasty in-laws from Hell?—Nick Riganas Opening in the year 1989, inside the Le Domas mansion, siblings Daniel (Etienne Kellici) and Alex (Chase Churchill) are running around while being followed by a man. Daniel hides Alex in a closet before he is approached by the man, Charles (Andrew Anthony), the new husband of the boys' Aunt Helene (Elana Dunkelman). Charles pleads with Daniel to help him, as he has just been wounded and is being hunted. Instead, Daniel alerts the rest of his family to Charles's presence. Helene tries to save her husband, but the family drags Charles into a room to his grisly fate.30 years laterAlex (now played by Mark O'Brien) is getting married to a woman named Grace (Samara Weaving). She is nervous but eager to join his family's gaming ""dominion"", which is how they came about their enormous wealth. The couple go for a photo-shoot prior to the ceremony, along with other members of Alex's family. Daniel (now played by Adam Brody) is joined by his wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), who is open about the fact that she only married Daniel for his family's money. Their father Tony (Henry Czerny) is visibly disapproving of Grace, but not nearly as much as Helene (now played by Nicky Guadagni), who shoots Grace a death glare. More approving is Alex and Daniel's mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), who tells Grace that only Alex's opinion matters. Moments later, everyone gathers for the ceremony, and Grace and Alex are married.Later, Grace and Alex are trying to get intimate, but they are interrupted by Helene, who reminds Alex that he needs to join the family for something. Alex then explains to Grace that as per tradition with every new addition to the Le Domas family, she has to join the family for a game at midnight.Grace and Alex reconvene with the family, who are now joined by Alex and Daniel's coke-head sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano), her husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun), and their sons Georgie (Liam MacDonald) and Gabe (Ethan Tavares). Everyone gathers around a table while one of the maids, Clara (Hanneke Talbot), is reading the boys a bedtime story. Tony explains to Grace that this tradition was started by his great grandfather Victor, who made a deal with a mysterious benefactor known as Mr. Le Bail. He granted Victor and his future generations their wealth, as well as a special box, while Victor was told to give his own part in the bargain. The family passes Grace the box to draw a card from it and pick the game. Charity said she got Chess, while Fitch got Old Maid. Grace draws Hide and Seek, and the room falls silent.Tony instructs Grace to stay hidden until dawn in order to win, which does not sound appealing to her at all. As she goes to hide, the family arms themselves with guns, except for Helene and Fitch, who get an ax and crossbow, respectively. Grace goes to hide in a dumbwaiter, and Alex chooses to sit this out. As the family goes off to find Grace, Alex leaves his room to go warn her, which Charity finds out about. Grace leaves the dumbwaiter and wanders before she is found by Alex, who covers her mouth and tells her to be quiet. Clara is walking around, as Georgie has gotten out of bed. As she looks for him, a gunshot rings out, and Clara's face is blown off. Emilie fired the shot, thinking it was Grace, but she realizes her error. Tony, Helene, Daniel, and Becky come in to help move Clara's body. Grace sits in horror at what she just witnessed. Alex pulls her into another room to explain the truth to her. Hide and Seek, for the Le Domases, means that they think they need to hunt Grace and kill her before dawn, or else they will die. Alex admits that he didn't tell her about this because he feared that she would leave him, but he promises to find a way to get her out safely.Grace trades her heels for tennis shoes and tears off the bottom of her dress to move around more easily. She starts to walk out but is immediately spotted by Tony, Helene, and Daniel. They try to incapacitate her, but Emilie, fresh off another line of coke, starts wildly firing at Grace and misses. She runs for it, and the others realize that Grace knows the truth now. She is also found by Daniel, but he could not care less about the hunt, so he gives Grace a head start before alerting everyone.The family gathers together to come up with a new plan, when another maid, Tina (Celine Tsai), comes in trying to tell Tony that she saw Grace. Emilie, who was given Fitch's crossbow, accidentally fires an arrow through Tina's head. Helene chops Tina's head off when she won't stop groaning. She then suggests to Tony that they turn on the cameras to locate Grace, but Tony is against it since it's not part of the tradition.Grace finds a rifle and ammo, and she loads up. She hides in the kitchen while Alex tries to turn on the cameras and disable the locks on the doors and windows. The butler, Stevens (John Ralston), enters the kitchen to make tea. He hears Grace loading her rifle, and she is soon spotted. She tries to shoot Stevens, but he tells her the ammo is just for display. This doesn't stop her from smashing the teapot over his face and managing to evade him. Alex succeeds in unlocking the doors and windows, and Grace manages to get outside. Tony and Daniel find Alex in the control room, and Tony attacks him. Alex fights back but is talked down by Daniel, which only gives Tony a chance to knock Alex out. They handcuff Alex in his bedroom to prevent him from helping Grace. Meanwhile, she is outside on the roof but can overhear Tony and Helene talking. They know Alex has always rejected their tradition, being the ""good son"", but Helene thinks that Alex will come to accept his place in the family like she did when Charles was killed. She tried to fight it at first, but then realized she should have killed him herself, and she believes Alex will eventually follow in his family's footsteps.Grace is almost out of the house when she is spotted by the third maid, Dora (Daniela Barbosa), who is hiding in the dumbwaiter. She tries to call out to the family now that she has found Grace, but Dora then accidentally shuts the dumbwaiter, causing her to be crushed in it. Grace then flees once again.Grace makes it outside and runs to the stable. She sees Georgie walking there and thinks he will help her, but he draws a gun on her and shoots a hole through her hand. In response, she punches him in the face and knocks him out cold. Grace is then startled by a goat, leading her to fall into the Goat Pit, where the corpses of goats and unlucky family members are disposed. Grace climbs up to the top as the ladder starts breaking under her feet. She reaches the top but has a nail go through the hole in her hand. She manages to muster up the will to pull herself out, and then use part of her dress as a bandage. She runs back outside and manages to break through the front gate. She tries to flag someone down, but he is a prick and drives away from her. Not long after, she is found by Stevens, who tries to capture her. Grace fights him and attempts to strangle him with a piece of her dress. She takes his car, but doesn't see that he is still alive.Becky orders Daniel and Emilie to dispose of the maids in the Goat Pit, since the others think they have been doing more harm than good to the hunt. Daniel is fed up with the family, but Emilie is adamant in sticking to the tradition so her boys won't be hurt.Grace drives Stevens's car away and talks to a customer service agent, Justin (Nat Faxon), to get help. Unfortunately, since the car was already reported stolen, Justin shuts the car down, which leads to Stevens finding Grace and tranquilizing her. He drives back toward the mansion while video-chatting with the family to let them know he has Grace. He starts to play classical music over the radio and doesn't see Grace waking up, but the family does. They try to warn Stevens, but he doesn't see Grace as she kicks him twice in the head, causing him to roll the car over into a field. Stevens is dead, but Grace survives. She gets out and is found by Daniel. He says he can't let his family down, so he knocks her out and takes her back to the mansion.Becky goes to Alex's room to try and talk to him. She thinks that while he loves Grace, he will ultimately stick to his family's wishes. Alex tells her that he will kill her if anything happens to Grace.The family places Grace on an altar to begin the ritual to sacrifice her to Mr. Le Bail. They pass around a chalice and drink from it, but then they start violently puking just before Tony kills Grace. Daniel gave everyone something to make them sick, and he frees Grace from the altar. He tries to help her get out, but they are found by Charity. Knowing that he is no longer on their side, she shoots Daniel in the throat. Grace fights Charity and takes the gun from her. The bullets are gone, so she pistol-whips Charity. Grace tries to help Daniel, but he tells her to go. Alex breaks free from his cuffs and finds Daniel dying. He tries to save his brother, but it is too late. Tony then goes for Grace and tries to kill her himself, but she hits him over the head with a lantern and drops it, causing the curtains to catch fire. Grace is then found by Becky, who misses with her arrow but then tries to strangle Grace. Grace pulls the tablecloth down and grabs Mr. Le Bail's box, and she knocks Becky off of her before bludgeoning her to death with the box. Alex then comes across the scene and tries talking to Grace. He realizes that she may well not stay with him now, he turns on her and gives her up to his family.Everyone continues with the ritual by holding Grace down themselves. Just as Alex is about to plunge the dagger into his wife, Grace breaks Helene's grip by clawing her hand, before letting the dagger go into her shoulder. She gets off the table and holds the dagger toward the family while screaming. They then see that the sun has come up, meaning it is now too late. As they recoil in horror for their impending death, nothing happens. However, Helene plans to kill Grace anyway. She grabs the ax, when suddenly...BOOM! Helene explodes. Outside the room, the Hide and Seek record begins playing again of its own volition. Fitch explodes next, followed by a begging Charity. Emilie tries to get away with Georgie and Gabe, but she dies too as soon as they're out the door (only blood is seen). Tony tries yelling about how he followed the rules, but he turns into paste as well. Alex then tries to weasel his way into getting Grace's forgiveness, but she hands him her ring and says she wants a divorce, just as the song finishes its hide and seek countdown and ends. BOOM goes Alex. The fire from the curtains then spreads around the house, and for a brief moment, Grace sees the spirit of Mr. Le Bail sitting in his chair, before he disappears in a fiery puff.Grace exits the burning mansion, now covered in blood. She sits on the steps to smoke a cigarette, just as police and paramedics arrive. An officer asks Grace what the hell happened, to which she simply replies, ""In-laws."""

Thrust into a citywide manhunt for a duo of cop killers, NYPD detective Andre Davis begins to uncover a massive conspiracy that links his fellow police officers to a criminal empire and must decide who he is hunting and who is actually hunting him. During the manhunt, Manhattan is completely locked down for the first time in its history - no exit or entry to the island including all 21 bridges. An embattled NYPD detective is thrust into a citywide manhunt for a pair of cop killers after uncovering a massive and unexpected conspiracy. As the night unfolds, lines become blurred on who he is pursuing, and who is in pursuit of him. When the search intensifies, extreme measures are taken to prevent the killers from escaping Manhattan as the authorities close all 21 bridges to prevent any entry or exit from the iconic island.—STXfilms Andre Davis is a successful NYPD officer like his father, who was murdered on duty when Davis was 13. Struggling with his father's legacy, Davis has earned a reputation for pursuing and killing ""cop-killers"" for years, although he claims they were all in self-defense and is uncomfortable with the label.One night, Michael Trujillo and Ray Jackson, two small-time criminals and war veterans, attempt to steal several kilograms of cocaine from a wine shop. They find more cocaine than they were expecting, and when police officers arrive, Ray guns them down in a shootout. Michael chastises Ray for putting them in jeopardy by killing the officers. Assigned to the case, Davis and narcotics detective Frankie Burns come into conflict with FBI agents, who attempt to take it over. With the reluctant approval of the deputy mayor, the FBI, and the precinct's head, Captain McKenna, Davis asks for the island of Manhattan to be locked down, on the condition that they catch the criminals before 5 a.m.Ray and Michael coerce their liaison, Bush, to persuade their handler to give them a bigger cut in exchange for their identities changed for their escape. They are given more money and their fixer, Adi, gives them new identities and tells them to depart for Miami the next morning. Davis and Burns manage to identify Ray, Michael, and Bush. Bush is gunned down by Butchco and Dugan, who get there first. After catching Butchco planting his backup sidearm on Bush's body and briefly scuffling with him, Davis becomes more suspicious when a team of police led by Lieutenant Kelly quickly manages to locate Adi's apartment. Adi is mortally wounded by the policemen but manages to give Michael two flash drives and their password.Davis and Burns manage to catch up to Michael and Ray; after accidentally killing a civilian, Ray is fatally wounded by Davis. Michael holds Burns at gunpoint, telling Davis about the flash drives and how suspicious everything is, before escaping. Burns scold Davis for letting Michael escape despite Davis' reputation. Michael hides in a hotel room, where he unlocks the contents of the flash drive and realizes that McKenna's precinct was involved in trafficking the drugs from the winery and earning profits for it, and that all seven of the cops he and Ray had killed in the shootout had been corrupt. After another chase where Michael abandons his money, Davis manages to corner him in a subway train and convinces him to surrender, promising to keep him alive. Michael is suddenly shot by Burns, who had also boarded the train and claimed that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Davis berates her for shooting Michael, who secretly handed over the drives, along with the password, to Davis before dying. As the police congratulate the two for their efforts, Davis discovers that Burns had contacted Kelly before Adi's apartment was raided.The next morning, McKenna arrives at his home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint, having accessed the drives. McKenna reasons that the officers were struggling to survive on a measly pay, which forced them to go into drug trafficking, but Davis refuses to walk away. McKenna, along with an arriving Butchco, Dugan and Kelly - who were all on McKenna's payroll - open fire on Davis. Davis kills all of them, including McKenna, who refuses to surrender. Burns, whom Davis deduced was also allied with McKenna, appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint, but surrenders after Davis reveals that he had already leaked the information online, exposing all the corrupt cops in New York, and reasons that her daughter would live without her mother should she get a life sentence for killing him.In the aftermath, Davis solemnly drives along the Manhattan Bridge in the sunset, taking the drives with him."
Happy Death Day 2U,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8155288/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Tree Gelbman discovers that dying over and over was surprisingly easier than the dangers that lie ahead. Having survived the farcical but utterly life-threatening events inHappy Death Day (2017), the feisty sorority sister, Tree Gelbman, finds herself in the same college dorm, thankful to be alive. However, this time, it's Carter's roommate, Ryan, who claims that he is reliving the same paradoxical day over and over again, as a mysterious paranoid killer in a single-toothed baby-faced mask with a big kitchen knife has made a habit of murdering him. Under those circumstances, a valiant but vain attempt to face the challenge, once more, will send Tree back to square one, trapped in an all too familiar and blood-drenched time loop. How many deaths separate Tree from a truly happy birthday?—Nick Riganas This sequel to 'Happy Death Day' opens with Ryan (Phi Vu) waking up in his car after being forced to sleep there. He goes to his room to find Tree (Jessica Rothe) and Carter (Israel Broussard) hooking up, and Carter makes him get lost. Ryan goes to meet with his friends Samar (Suraj Sharma) and Dre (Sarah Yarkin) in the school's science lab. They have been working on an experiment involving a reactor they have built and are on the verge of a breakthrough, until Dean Bronson (Steve Zissis) comes in and orders them to shut their project down due to the constant damages it does to the school's power.Later, Ryan goes through the science lab in the dark and checks the closet. He is startled by Samar appearing behind him, only for the Babyface Killer to emerge from the closet and stab Ryan in the chest. Ryan then immediately wakes up at the beginning of the same day, and he notices everything happens the same way it did the first time. He goes to his room to interrupt Tree and Carter to tell him what he just experienced. Tree figures he is now caught in his own death time loop and recaps the events of the first movie to him to get a gist of what has gone on. She and Carter agree to help Ryan find out who's trying to kill him. They retrace his steps back to the lab, but nobody is in the closet when they look there. When Ryan shows Tree and Carter the reactor, she realizes Ryan was the one who created the time loop that caused her to keep repeating Monday the 18th.Tree and Carter are at a pep rally when a fire alarm goes off. As the students are being escorted out, Ryan spots Babyface staring right at him and starts to run in the opposite direction, with Babyface following closely. He catches up to Ryan, but Tree knocks him out with a bat. They take off his mask and are shocked to find that the killer is none other than...RYAN. Actually, it's Ryan from an alternate time line. He has come to kill the Ryan from this time line to prevent him from creating a catastrophic event with the reactor. Ryan 1 goes to activate the reactor to try and fix the time lines, just as Bronson arrives to try and stop them. Ryan 2 attempts to destroy the reactor, but it goes off and causes a crazy blast that knocks everyone back.Tree wakes up in Carter's room. He repeats the same things to her that he said every time she woke up on her birthday. She hears her birthday ringtone and realizes she has once again found herself waking up on Monday the 18th. Tree freaks out and angrily storms the campus with Carter and Ryan to the lab to figure out what's going on. They get Samar and Dre together after discovering that their reactor works, but Tree demands that they fix it so she can return to a normal day.Tree goes to her room to find Lori (Ruby Modine). She asks for the poisoned cupcake that she figures Lori was preparing, but she tells Tree there is no cupcake, which means that Lori is not planning on killing Tree. While in the dining hall, Tree sees in horror that, in this time line, Carter is dating Danielle (Rachel Matthews), who is apparently not rotten like the Danielle that Tree knows too well. Tree then goes to join her dad David (Jason Bayle) for their birthday lunch. To Tree's very big surprise, her mother Julie (Missy Yager) is alive in this dimension. She goes to tearfully embrace her mother for the first time in years, and the three spend their time celebrating both Tree's and Julie's birthdays. Tree later looks through her phone and sees years of memories with her mom that she never knew about.Just as Tree is deciding to stay in this dimension, she sees a news report about John Tombs (Rob Mello) being taken to the hospital. She rushes there to kill him and grabs a fire ax. As Tree walks in to Tombs's room, she is caught by a cop and is forced to drop the ax as he cuffs her. The cop is escorting her out when Babyface stabs the killer to death. She still thinks it's Lori until Lori turns up in the elevator behind her and grabs Tree to safety. Lori takes her through an area that's under construction, but Babyface gets them there and stabs Lori in the chest, killing her. He then chases Tree up the stairs, but she manages to trip him down. He gets up quickly and catches Tree on the roof. She loses her balance and falls to her death.Tree wakes up on the same day again and sees she is still in the alternate dimension. She goes with Ryan to the lab to explain to him and Samar and Dre again so that they can close both time loops. However, finding the right algorithm to get the reactor running again involves Tree having to die multiple times until she can memorize the right information that will give them the algorithm. Tree then goes through a suicide montage, with deaths such as electrocuting herself in the tub, drinking drain cleaner, diving into a wood chipper, skydiving in her underwear with no parachute (while flipping the bird and deliberately landing in front of Carter and Danielle), and also jumping to her death. However, when she wakes up again, the added trauma from her constant dying continues to take its toll on her, and she collapses in Carter's arms before he takes her to the hospital.Tree is met by Gregory (Charles Aitken), who doesn't know who tree is since he is not her student, and it is also Lori with whom he is having an affair. Tree tells him to go get Lori away from Tombs, as she is escorting him to the operating room. Tree runs out and knocks the cop out to take his gun. When she gets to the OR, Lori is already dead. Tombs appears behind Tree, but she shoots him twice. She asks who freed him, right before Babyface appears and tries to grab the gun out of Tree's hand. She sees a tank of flammable gas and shoots it to kill them both.Tree wakes up and pleads with her friends to fix the loops fast, as she doesn't know how much more time she has before she stays dead. Carter follows her on the way out, and she tells him that they are together in the other time line, and that's why it's hard for her to make a choice between him and her mom. Carter tries to tell Tree that she is living someone else's life and that she should not stay in the past. Tree leaves goes to meet with her parents for lunch and starts to feel pain again. Tree asks her parents to take her away from campus. As they drive, Julie mentions eating a treat with Tree for their birthdays, but Tree realizes what Carter meant, as these memories are not her own. The family stops at a motel to rest. Tree gets a text from Ryan saying they are close to closing the loops. While David is in the bathroom, Tree talks to Julie and asks her what she would do if she never met David. Julie says she cannot imagine a life without him, and tells Tree how she changed her life after she was born. The tender moment is interrupted when Tree sees on TV that Tombs has escaped and has killed Lori, the cop, and Carter, who went to stop Tombs. Tree realizes she has to stop the loop from closing, or else Carter and Lori will stay dead. She grabs the car keys and rushes out, trying to reach Ryan but failing as he and the others are gearing up for the reactor to go off. Tree then drives toward an electrical plant and charges into a box just a second before the reactor goes off.Tree is revived and goes to tell Ryan the algorithm, but this time, she has decided to return to her original time line. Bronson and two security guards then come in to seize the reactor a whole day earlier than planned. Needing an urgent plan to steal it back, Tree gets Danielle to pose as a blind French student to distract Bronson while they take his keys and get into the office where the reactor is before taking it back to the lab.Before returning home, Tree goes around trying to get closure. She approaches Lori and sincerely talks to her about ending her affair with Gregory, as she knows it's not worth it. Tree then gives Lori a hug. She then goes to Danielle's room to say how wrong she was about her, only to find a guy emerging from the bathroom with nothing but a towel, and Tree sees that Danielle sucks in both dimensions. Finally, Tree goes to have the birthday lunch with her parents, but she asks David to let her have a moment alone with Julie, which is basically Tree having one more final moment with her mother.Tree goes to the hospital that night to save Lori. She gets to the room with the cop's gun and kills Tombs before he can attack. The ladies run out but are cornered by Babyface. Tree correctly guesses that the killer here is Gregory, wanting to silence Lori for the affair. Before they can run, Gregory's wife Stephanie (Laura Clifton) shows up to shoot Lori. She hands the gun to Gregory to kill Tree, but he shoots Stephanie first. Tree runs and grabs a weapon, and Gregory goes after her. He gets Tree in a room containing a high-powered magnet that he doesn't notice...but Tree does. She holds a screwdriver as he draws his gun on her, but she has some final words for him: ""You're screwed."" With that, she turns the magnet on, and Gregory gets caught in it by a metal chair. Tree releases the screwdriver, which runs through Gregory's chest, killing him.Carter shows up, and he and Tree help Lori onto a stretcher. Tree tells Lori she is sorry for how things turned out, and how she wishes things could be different, even though Lori doesn't know what she means. Meanwhile, Ryan, Samar, and Dre have gotten the reactor up and running, but Bronson and the guards are trying to stop them again. Samar and Dre hold them off as long as they can while the reactor turns on. Tree tells Carter again that they are together in the other time line, and they share a kiss right just as the reactor reaches its mark, a mere second before Bronson can pull the plug.Everyone wakes up in the room right before the first blast. Tree looks over to Carter and asks, ""Danielle?"" He responds with, ""Who?"" and she gleefully pounces on him as she sees she is back home.During the closing credits, Tree, Carter, Ryan, Samar, and Dre are forced to do community service for turning on the reactor. A couple of vans pull up, and an agent from DARPA comes to escort the five to headquarters. They have taken the reactor and commend Ryan for his scientific breakthrough. DARPA wants to conduct an experiment with it, meaning they need a human subject to trap in a time loop. Tree says she has the perfect candidate.The final shot shows Danielle waking up in bed screaming."

However, in this friendly and verdant haven of peace, harmony, and constant sunshine, the welcoming community's peculiar traditions start to blemish the folkloric utopia, as the uncomfortable feeling of uneasiness starts to creep up on Pelle's guests. But, in the eyes of the uninitiated newcomers, the naturalistic rituals seem brutal. Could a numbing truth be hiding in plain sight?—Nick Riganas Several friends travel to northern Europe to study as anthropologists a Swedish summer festival that is held every ninety years in the remote hometown of one of them. What should have been a dream vacation in a place where the sun never sets, gradually turns into a dark nightmare as the mysterious inhabitants invite them to participate in their disturbing festive activities.—yusufpiskin The film opens with a mural of a bizarre, eerie ritual taking place. We then see images of dark, snowy forests with the sound of old folk singing playing in the background.College student Dani Ardor (Florence Pugh) calls her parents but is sent to voicemail. She expresses concern over her bipolar sister Terri (Klauda Csanyi), who left her a cryptic message recently. Dani then calls her boyfriend Christian Hughes (Jack Reynor), who is hanging out with his buddies Josh (William Jackson Harper), Mark (Will Poulter), and Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren). Christian assures Dani that this is just another one of Terri's episodes, but he adds that Dani only feeds into Terri's antics. After he hangs up, she gets a call from an unknown number. Josh and Mark think Christian should just end it with Dani since it's clear he's wanted out of the relationship for a while, and as they are planning an upcoming trip to Sweden (Eastern Europe), Pelle suggests they will meet lots of other women. Dani calls Christian again and is wailing hysterically. We then see authorities going into Dani's parents' home, where Terri has flooded the house with carbon monoxide, killing her parents before stuffing the tube into her mouth and taping it there. Christian goes to Dani's apartment to console her.Several months later, Dani tries to contain her grief. She hangs out with Christian and his friends and learns about their trip to Sweden to a midsommar celebration in the Harga, a village where Pelle grew up. The celebration occurs every 90 years and lasts about nine days. Josh, in particular, is interested since he wants to write about the experience for his anthropology dissertation. Christian invites Dani to be nice, and although she accepts, Christian thinks she doesn't want to go since she's still reeling from the murder-suicide. However, Dani is more upset that Christian is only now telling her about the trip, which they are set to leave for within two weeks.Dani and Christian go to hang out with his friends. While he steps out of the room, Pelle talks to Dani about the midsommar celebration, and their tradition of choosing a May Queen at the end of the celebration. Pelle also tries to console Dani over her loss, stating that his parents had also passed away, but the mere mention of it triggers her, and she goes to the bathroom to cry.Dani joins Christian and his friends for the trip. They drive out to the Harga and meet Pelle's brother Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg), plus an English couple named Simon (Archie Madekewe) and Connie (Ellora Torchia). The group takes magic mushrooms, but Ingemar offers Dani a special tea since it has a better taste. She agrees to it and initially enjoys the trip until Pelle says that the group is like his family. The word gets to Dani, and she goes to take a walk. She starts to experience a bad trip, and gets paranoid when another high group of people she comes across starts laughing in her direction. Dani goes to hide in a shed but is mortified by what appears to be Terri behind her. She then runs into the woods, where the trees appear to morph around her before she passes out. She briefly dreams about Terri and their parents.Dani wakes up next to Christian six hours later. They join their friends in going back toward the village to meet the rest of the Harga community. Josh inquires about the many cultural aspects of the festival and the community, but when he asks about a mysterious golden teepee in the distance, he doesn't get a direct answer. A girl named Maja (Isabelle Grill) shows interest in Christian by playfully kicking him as he sits in a circle.Pelle later gifts Dani with a drawing of herself for her birthday. She mentions that Christian forgot their birthday, but he later gives her a slice of cake to make up for it. When asked how long they have been together, Christian thinks it has just been over three years, but Dani corrects him and says they have been together for four years. Pelle then brings his friends to the place where they will be sleeping.The following day, the group joins the community for a feast. Two of the eldest villagers, Ylva (Katarina Weidhagen) and The Laborer (Lars Varinger), are the guests of honor, as they practice a breathing exercise before the whole community follows them to the edge of a cliff. The elders cut their hands as they walk by the edge. The newcomers watch in horror as Ylva drops herself off the cliff and lands facefirst onto a rock, leaving them to witness her gruesome faceless skull. The Laborer leaps off as well, but he only shatters his leg. He moans in agony, and the villagers mimic the sounds of his moaning. Three of the villagers proceed to smash his head with a sledgehammer. Simon and Connie express their absolute horror, while Dani goes back to her room. An elder villager woman, Siv (Gunnel Fred), explains to the group that this is a natural part of their ritual, as the two elders reached what they felt was the end of their life cycle, and prolonging it further would have been bad. Pelle goes to comfort Dani, thinking that her distress is linked more to her recent tragedy than it is to what she just witnessed. He attempts to console Dani, but she thinks him getting close to her is inappropriate since Christian could come in. Pelle then questions how much Christian really means to Dani, based on how he is around her.Dani later has a nightmare that Christian and his friends are leaving without her. They drive away in the middle of the night as she watches them go, and she is plagued by haunting imagery of her dead family and the corpses of the two elders.After what they saw, Simon and Connie plan to leave, but when Connie is ready to go, she is told that Simon went off with another villager to the train that would take them home. Connie is angered that Simon would leave without her, and she proceeds to walk off on her own. Meanwhile, Christian tells Josh he also wants to do his thesis on the Harga, but Josh is not happy about that. He argues that Christian can never just do his own thing instead of picking off what Josh is doing. Christian offers to ask the elders if they are allowed to collaborate on the project. Josh later learns that the village's ritualistic practices are based on paintings made by a member named Ruben (Levente Puczko-Smith), a deformed boy who was the product of incest but is viewed as some kind of seer. Josh asks to take pictures of Ruben's drawings, but he is forbidden.The elders' bodies are buried in the middle of the village. Their ashes are spread across an ancestral tree, which Mark pisses on. He is scolded by Ulf (Henrik Norlen), who actually breaks down sobbing at the act. Mark is then told the significance of the tree, but he has a callous reaction over it. Elsewhere, Christian and Josh are told that they are allowed to collaborate on their thesis, on the condition that they omit the actual names and location of the Harga. The two agree. Christian also asks about the village's mating rituals, inquiring as to whether incest was typical there, and he is told that incest isn't necessarily frowned upon, but outsiders are usually brought in to procreate with the villagers. A feast is then held, where Mark notices Ulf is staring daggers in his direction. Dani also overhears that Connie was taken to the station by one of the villagers. Mark is then taken away by a female villager, and the others never see him again.Later that night, Josh sneaks into the room where Ruben's book of paintings is kept. He is interrupted by who he thinks is Mark before he gets bludgeoned over the head. We then see that the figure is actually a villager wearing Mark's face. Josh is then dragged away.The next morning, Dani, Christian, and Pelle are told that Ruben's book has gone missing, and Josh and Mark disappearing looks suspicious. Afterwards, Dani joins the women in the village in a competition where they dance around a maypole before each woman is eliminated. After taking a drug, Dani finds herself being able to speak in Swedish with the other women. Dani is the last one standing, and she is crowned the May Queen. At the same time, Christian is given a drink that induces a trip. He is lured and taken to take Maja's virginity. He has sex with her while the other elder females stand nude around them and mimic Maja's moaning. After Dani is crowned May Queen, she watches Christian having sex with Maja through a hole in the door, which causes Dani to have a breakdown. She goes to cry, and the other women join her, sympathetically crying loudly with her. After climaxing, a mortified Christian runs out to try and find Dani, but he ends up discovering Josh's leg buried in the dirt, as well as Simon's mutilated corpse being used as a blood eagle. Moments later, he is found and knocked out when a villager blows powder in his face.The end of the ritual draws near, and the elders bring the drugged Christian, along with a villager named Torbjörn, before Dani, as she is supposed to choose someone for a sacrifice. As per tradition, nine people are to be sacrificed. This includes the two elders, four outsiders, two living volunteers, and one chosen by Dani. After all that she has gone through, she picks Christian.The men in the village take a fully grown bear and disembowel it so they can place Christian inside the bear's corpse. They bring him, Ingemar, and the corpses of Simon, Connie, Josh, and Mark to the golden teepee, which is then set on fire. Unable to move or speak, Christian succumbs to his fate while only being able to wheeze in pain, while Ulf screams in terror and ingemar watches. The villagers mimic the screams, while Dani appears to breakdown from what is happening again. However, as she continues to watch the teepee go up in flames, and hears the unified wailing of the villagers, a demented smile begins to form on her face."
Overcomer,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8186318/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A high-school basketball coach is asked to take over the cross-country program, where he encounters a troubled teen. Life changes overnight for Coach John Harrison when his high-school basketball team and state-championship dreams are crushed under the weight of unexpected news. When the largest manufacturing plant shuts down and hundreds of families leave their town, John questions how he and his family will face an uncertain future. After John reluctantly agrees to coach cross-country, he and his wife Amy meet an aspiring athlete who's pushing her limits on a journey toward discovery. Inspired by the words and prayers of a new friend, John becomes the least-likely coach helping the least-likely runner attempt the impossible in the biggest race of the year.—AFFIRM/Provident Films The opening scene takes us into the gym of Brookshire Christian School as the boys basketball team narrowly loses their hard-fought championship game in the last few seconds. After the game, the coach John Harrison consoles his son Ethan who missed the final shot of the game and his team telling them that next year they are posed to take the state championship as all their best players will be returning while their opponents' will have graduated.In the next scene, Coach Harrison and the other teachers at the school all learn through a television news broadcast that the manufacturing plant, the largest employer in their town of Franklin, is moving to another city. Another coach explains that his best players' families all work at the plant, but he assures Coach Harrison that basketball should be okay as he will still have his best players returning.Cut to a scene of high school boys playing basketball in the park. A young high school girl, Hannah Scott, walks by and sees one of the boys' expensive headphones lying on the bench by where they are playing. When the boy realizes they are gone and looks around, he sees Hannah. She runs through the woods with all the teenage boys chasing her. When they reach an apartment complex, they lose sight of her and assume she ran inside. Actually, she ducked behind some rocks and tried to hide her heavy breathing from the boys to keep from being discovered. We learn she has asthma when she pulls out her inhaler. After the boys give up the chase and leave, she continues on to her grandmother's house. There, her grandmother holds out an iPod and asks Hannah where it came from, insinuating she stole it and tells her to take it back saying she already bought her one. After her grandmother leaves for work, Hannah takes the stolen headphones and puts them in a box hidden in her room, presumably filled with more stolen objects, including another set of headphones.In her office, Principal Olivia Brooks (Priscilla Shirer) tells Coach Harrison that the school is losing several teachers and coaches, and she needs him to coach cross country as she doesn't want the school to lose another program. He protests as he doesn't like cross country or even think that it's a real sport, but he doesn't have much of a choice. When he goes to tryouts, however, only Hannah shows up to join. She has a form signed by her grandmother, indicating she was born on Valentine's Day, and she has asthma. When the coach protests to the principal, she tells him even one runner matters.At the first practice, Hannah runs a respectable, but not impressive time. Back at the Harrison home, he complains to his wife, Amy, another teacher at the school, and tries to recruit his basketball-playing son Ethan to run cross country as well. Ethan says he will only if his dad will run with him to train, so Harrison drops that idea. A phone call from their pastor reminds Amy she promised that Coach Harrison would help the pastor with hospital visitation that night.At the hospital, Coach Harrison accidentally enters the room of Thomas Hill (Cameron Arnett), a blind man suffering from diabetes complications and a former cross country runner. Hill says he doesn't often have visitors and invites Harrison to come back.Things go downhill for Harrison. He continues to lose basketball players and realizes he won't have a team at all, that his son will have no opportunity to get a college scholarship, and that all the teachers are getting a 10% pay cut. His wife tries to encourage him with mixed results. After Hannah's unimpressive performance at their first meet, Harrison returns to visit Hill and ask for advice on how to coach her. Along with giving suggestions on cross country coaching, Hill challenges Harrison to consider what his true identity is. If he's not a coach or a teacher or a husband or a father, then who is he? He answers that he's a Christian, and Hill asks him if his faith is so important why didn't he list it earlier.Hill shares how he had to lose his own eyesight before he could clearly see what was important-how he hurt so many people and was selfish. Harrison learns that Hill had a girlfriend, got her pregnant, got her on meth, abandoned his baby girl after she died. The baby was born on Valentine's Day 15 year ago and now lives with relatives. Harrison puts the pieces together and realizes his daughter is Hannah.Conflicted about what to do, as Hannah's grandmother has told her both of her parents are dead, Harrison asks Principal Brooks about the situation. We learn Brooks was a friend of Hannah's mother and has been the one paying for Hannah's tuition. She says she can't counsel the coach to go around the grandmother, but she also is sure that if they don't, Hannah will never know her father. So Amy and John ask Hill first if he would like to see Hannah, and then they ask Hannah. In their first meeting at the hospital, Hannah can only stay a few moments before she has to leave from all the emotion stirred up. She later returns and asks him to tell her what happened. Hill tells the story and says he knows he doesn't deserve it but hopes she can someday forgive him. Hannah says, ""It's hard.""Hannah and Principal Brooks talk about all Hannah's feelings about her father-about feeling unloved, a mistake, unwanted, abandoned. Principal Brooks tells Hannah that she has another father, a perfect Father who has always wanted her and loved her and cares for her. They pray together, and Hannah asks Jesus Christ to be part of her life. Principal Brooks challenges Hannah to read the first two chapters of the book of Ephesians in the Bible and to write down all the things it says about her.She writes down things like: ""I am blessed. I am chosen. I am forgiven. I am redeemed. I am loved.""Hannah dramatically declares all of these things in front of Coach Harrison, and the drama class at school then returns all the things she had been stealing. She goes to her father's hospital room and finds it empty. Grateful to find he was only moved to ICU after a possible heart attack, Hannah informs him she has two things to tell him. First, she has given her life to Christ and second, if Jesus can forgive her for all the things that she has done, then she can forgive him. Of course, he is thrilled.When Hannah returns home, she finds her grandmother has come home early from work and is livid when Hannah tells her she was visiting her father. She feels betrayed. She tells Hannah that she was trying to protect her by keeping her away from him. Her grandmother goes to the Harrisons' home and threatens them and the school with legal action if they ever help her see him again. Then she goes to Hill's hospital room and tells him to let her go, that he only brings hurt to everyone.All of them pray. The Harrisons pray together for wisdom on what to do. Hill prays that God wouldn't leave him useless after just getting back his daughter. Hannah's grandmother prays that God would help her to forgive all of the hurt of losing her daughter, of working so hard all these years to take care of Hannah. She says only God can do it.At a meeting of the regional cross country coaches before the state championship, a vote is taken on whether or not to allow runners to use earbuds. At first, opposed, Harrison quickly changes his mind and lobbies the other coaches to vote in favor as well.At the state championship, Coach Harrison gives Hannah an earbud and a player telling him to push the play button when the race starts. She does, and she hears the voice of her father coaching her through every step of the race. He tells her how much he loves her, how proud he is of her, how they are going to do this together. He coaches her to find her pace, to dig into the hills, to pass girl after girl. With the encouragement and expert coaching of her father, Hannah runs her best race ever and literally falls over the finish line, having given her everything to overtake the former state champion in the last stretch. As paramedics bring oxygen for Hannah, everyone waits for the final results, which were too close to call without review. When they determine Hannah won by leaning forward an inch more; her classmates hoist her on their shoulders and everyone cheers. Hannah's grandmother stayed to watch her race even though it meant she was late for work. After her congratulations, Hannah tells her she wants to see her dad, and her grandmother nods and tells the Harrisons to bring her home after.At the hospital, Hannah puts the medal around her father's neck. He is thrilled that she medaled. Then Coach Harrison tells him it's not just any medal; she won the state championship. Hannah wraps her arms around him, puts her head on his chest, and says, ""I had a really good coach.""Hill's casket at the cemetery is surrounded by Hannah, her grandmother, the Harrisons, Principal Brooks, and others. The pastor says Hill's story was one of redemption. Hannah tells Coach Harrison that she ""had the best dad in the world for six weeks.""The last scenes are six years later. We see Hannah sharing her story with others in a group, scenes of her running cross country in college, and her opening up a box tied with a ribbon (one of a whole set that Coach Harrison apparently has in a drawer that he mails on her birthday) and inserting a flash drive into her player and running through the city while listening to a recording made by her father for her saying, ""This is your 21st birthday, Hannah. This is the prayer I have prayed for you for this year..."""
The Art of Racing in the Rain,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478839/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Through his bond with his owner, aspiring Formula One race car driver Denny, golden retriever Enzo learns that the techniques needed on the racetrack can also be used to successfully navigate the journey of life. Dog lovers believe their canine family members understand language, comprehend events, have opinions, exude loyalty. In ""The Art of Racing In The Rain"", wise old dog Enzo Swift shares thoughts about the life experiences which prepared him to protect his family in times of greatest need. In death basket flashbacks, doting golden retriever Enzo tells his wonderful life with devoted owner Denny, a talented aspiring Formula One race car driver, who put his racing dream back to marry Eve and raise their daughter Zoe. Only after Eve dies in a tragic accident and a bitter custody case against Denny by her rich parents, he accepts a test driver job in Ferrari's Milan HQ. By then, inseparable Enzo is so sick he can only enjoy a first and last ride in Denny's stat of the art F1 car, confident he'll be reborn as a budding racer, as apparently happens eight years later.—KGF Vissers The film begins in Seattle, where an old golden retriever is lying in front of a door. He is alive and awake, but barely moving. We begin hearing his thoughts. Life as he knows it is close to the end, but he talks about how he once was watching television and learned about what Mongolians believe about dogs. They are reincarnated and return as dogs, and when they finally live a full life, they come back once more, as humans. We also learn that he believes being unable to communicate with humans is a curse. He is waiting for Denny, his master, and best friend.Denny comes home and finds Enzo, a golden retriever, unable to even move from the puddle of urine he is laying in. Denny knows the end is nearing. He picks up Enzo and takes him to the couch. Enzo then begins telling us about his life.Enzo is a puppy and is in a large box/pen outside with the rest of the litter. He tells that even then he knew he was different. Denny arrives and walks up to the pack of puppies. Enzo walks over right to Denny. He begins licking him, and the two quickly form a bond. After the couple who are selling the dogs do a little routine so they can get more money, Denny asks how much for the puppy.Denny arrives at a garage and takes Enzo out of the car. He introduces him to his friends. One of his friends points out that he's going to have to take care of the puppy and will have to make time for him. The other asks if he is coming to his band's concert that night. Denny quickly responds he has to stay home with Enzo.Denny leaves and goes to his job. He teaches auto racing and his boss, Don, thinks highly of him. He also helps get him jobs as a GT race driver. When he's not racing or teaching, Denny and Enzo are inseparable. Enzo tells us he loved Denny unconditionally and Denny takes him for runs and watches races on TV with him. Denny says that even though Enzo is a dog, he is a racer at heart and Enzo agrees.A year quickly goes by, and the two have settled into a routine. Then, while they are grocery shopping, Denny meets Eve. Enzo can sense Denny's interest in Eve, and is jealous. He tries to drag Denny away from her literally, but Denny reins in Enzo and asks Eve to his friend's concert. He jokes and says they are Seattle's third-best SoundGarden cover band.They begin dating and quickly fall in love. While Eve is incredibly supportive of Denny, Enzo does not feel that close to her, but he tries because he knows she is important to Denny.Soon the couple is married, and they make it work even though Denny has to leave most weekends to race. Eve's parents, who Enzo refers to as the ""twins,"" clearly do not approve of Denny's career. They don't like that he's gone often and doesn't make much money. The mother is more accepting than the father. He races well, but different circumstances cost him from ever making it big. Eve becomes pregnant, and Denny is happy. Enzo even senses a change in Eve and begins to accept her. One night she even has him rest his chin on her belly, and he feels the baby kick. Enzo even admits to being jealous that she can carry a baby in her while it is assembled. He's okay with it but wants the baby to look like him when it is born.Denny accepts an endurance race in Daytona but is unsure of following through since it is close to Eve's due date. Always supportive, she says she's not due until two weeks after and she has never been early for anything. He leaves.Enzo watches Denny's race on the television and Eve goes through childbirth. She gives birth to a daughter, which she names Zoe. When the midwives are done and Eve is holding Zoe comfortably in bed, she tells Enzo to come on over. Enzo quickly arrives and loves the baby, describing her as like nothing he has ever seen before. However, he does not love one her gifts, a stuffed animal zebra.Denny returns home and says he should have been there. Clearly, Eve's parents are not thrilled that he wasn't, but they don't let on. Eve assures Enzo that they are fine and it's okay he 'wasn't there. He tells her he raced well, but he was replaced at the end by an upcoming driver who crashed just before the end. He raced well, but since his team didn't even finish, it means nothing and will not be his big break.Time quickly passes, and we see the family over time. We see a conversation between Denny and Eve about racing when it rains. She asks him if it scares him. He said he doesn't. He talks about how you can give in to that fear, and if you do you, then you have given up control. He tells her how he begins the skid before the turn, so he controls it. He doesn't give up control of the car, ever.Time passes, and Zoe gets older. Eve continues her job as a teacher, and Enzo enjoys the family. Eve complains of a headache one day. Soon after, we learn Enzo can smell the cancer in her head. He describes a 'rotting wood' odor come from her. Unable to communicate this, though, life goes on for the family.Later, Eve is very sick while Denny is away. She is vomiting into the kitchen sink. She rushes out with Zoe and leaves Enzo all alone. Enzo soon runs out of food and must drink water from the toilet. He finds the occasional cheerio on the floor. One night, during a lightning storm, Enzo says he is hallucinating. He sees Zoe's evil zebra rip another stuffed animal apart and then the zebra rips out its own stuffing.After a few days, Denny comes home and feeds Enzo. He calls Eve and asks her to come home. She does, and Zoe is upset when she finds all of her stuffed animals and toys ripped to shreds. Denny scolds Enzo and even yells he is a stupid dog. Eve tells him to stop berating the dog. Later, Denny finds Enzo in the yard and apologizes to him.Sometime after Eve is walking with Enzo in the woods, Eve is struggling but keeps telling Enzo (who loves Eve) that she is alright. Suddenly Eve passes out and Enzo barks until help arrives.Eve stays in the hospital while she undergoes tests and is treated. Denny takes care of Zoe and doesn't have as much time for Enzo. Eve is discharged and lives with her parents. Denny and Zoe spend time with her, while he condition deteriorates. One night, Enzo goes over to Eve. She admits she is no longer scared. She knows while this the end to her life here, there is more for her after this life. Enzo tells us he watched as she took her last breath. He says he watched her soul depart her body and leave for its next stage.The family has a funeral, and soon after, Denny's in-laws confront him. They want custody of Zoe and threaten to sue him. Maxwell, Eve's father, finally tells Denny what he thinks and Denny tells Zoe they are leaving and to grab her stuff. Maxwell grabs Denny's arm. Denny pulls it away, and Maxwell falls breaking a rib. Eve's mother, Trish, had her back turned during this event. Denny and Zoe leave.Denny hires his lawyer friend, Mark, who says it is an open and shut case. He should have no fear of losing Zoe. Then, while at work, Denny is arrested for assault. Maxwell is lying about what happened and says Denny was the aggressor. Mark tells Denny if he is convicted, he may never see his daughter again and that she is with the grandparents for the next 90 days. He cannot call or see her. Enzo is upset by this too.During this time, Denny is offered a job in Italy testing and racing new prototypes for Ferrari. He tells them he cannot leave the state or accept such a job because of all that is going on in his life. The man gives him his business card and tells him he understands and if things should change to give him a call.Denny is upset. The 90 days pass and through his in-laws submit a deal. Denny doesn't know what to do but says he will fight. One night, Denny goes running with Enzo like they used to do, but Enzo, older, struggles to keep pace. Lagging behind, he attempts to follow Denny across the street. He is hit by a car. Denny rushes him to a 24-hour animal hospital.The vet tells Denny that Enzo is extremely lucky. He will survive, but that this could cause problems in the future. He doesn't have enough money to pay the vet fully.Enzo starts to come out of a drug-induced haze a few weeks later. He sees Denny about to agree to a lousy custody deal. Just in time, Enzo grabs the legal document and rips it to shreds. Denny understands Enzo's message and decides to fight it.Later, Denny's friend comes over to watch Enzo as Denny heads to court. Enzo is nervous and anxious to find out what happened. Denny calls his friend to tell him what happened.We find out through a brief flashback to the court proceedings that Eve's mother began to lie on the stand and say she saw Denny push Maxwell to the ground. She is dismissed as a witness, but she can't bring herself to leave things this way. She admits the truth and the charges are dropped. Denny will win and receive full custody of his daughter.Denny calls the Ferrari representative and agrees to take the job. His new boss is thrilled to hear this, and Enzo is excited to be moving to Italy.Denny throws Zoe a birthday party. His in-laws show up uninvited. Denny still graciously invites them in. While the party goes on, Enzo, weakened by age, sleeps under that table.Cut to the beginning of the movie. We see the exact opening scene, but this time it plays on longer. Denny has the ailing dog on the couch with him. He puts on racing and gets an idea.Denny takes Zoe and Enzo to the race track where he used to teach. His old boss lets him drive Enzo on the track. Enzo talks about all he has learned and that he is sure his next life will be that of a human. He tells us he will be more prepared than other babies starting out and what he laments, like not being able to see Italy. He tells us he knows Denny will make it. He will wow people during testing and get his big break. He will become a great Formula One racer. Denny continues to go faster and Enzo barks to let him know he wants one more lap. The screen fades to white.Eight years pass and Denny and Zoe are living in Italy. A man and a boy are introduced to Denny who is in full racing gear. The father speaks for the boy and says his son is a big fan. He was wondering if Denny would give the boy an autograph. Denny agrees to and asks the boys name. He is Enzo. Denny smiles and tells the father the boy reminds him of an old friend. The father and boy thank Denny and are ready to leave. Denny stops them and gives the father his number. He tells him that when his son is ready, he will train the boy. The father is touched and thanks Denny."

He becomes angrier and more troubled, ignoring his wife and child and abandoning his young students at the gym.

They mock her appearance, so she dyes her hair blonde and lathers on the sunless tanner to look more like the other girls. She gets into a spat with some of the other girls, but they claim she's never tried to get to know them and has only judged them. She asks Hutch why she didn't pick her brother, and he explains he saved him from a life of putting everything into wrestling, alienating his wife and child only to get a back injury that kicks him out of the game - which is what happened to him. He tells Paige to quit that she doesn't have what it takes.Paige returns home for Christmas.

Booksmart,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On the eve of their high-school graduation, two academic superstars and best friends realize they should have worked less and played more. Determined not to fall short of their peers, the girls try to cram four years of fun into one night. Two academic teenage superstars (Dever, Feldstein) realise, on the eve of their high school graduation, that they should have worked less and played more. Determined to never fall short of their peers, the girls set out on a mission to cram four years of fun into one night. The film starts with best friends Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (Beanie Feldstein) meeting up and heading to their last day at school. Both were straight A students throughout their whole high school career, and some of their classmates look down on them for being so nerdy. Even Principal Brown (Jason Sudeikis) would rather do anything else than to talk to Molly, who is class president. They do, however, have a friend in their teacher, Ms. Fine (Jessica Williams), who gives the girls her phone number if they ever need anything.During lunch, Amy observes a girl she has a crush on named Ryan (Victoria Ruesga). Molly encourages Amy to go talk to her, but when she does, she says something awkward and walks away bashfully.In the unisex bathroom, Molly overhears classmates Theo (Eduardo Franco), Tanner (Nico Haraga), and Triple A (Molly Gordon) talking trash about her. She steps out of the stall and asserts with confidence that she will have a bright future since she is going to Yale, while Amy is going to spend a summer abroad in Botswana to help the women of that region make tampons. It turns out Triple A also got into Yale, in spite of her promiscuous reputation. Tanner also got into a good school, and Theo, who was held back a few years, was recruited to work for Google. Molly starts to lose her mind, and she goes around asking the other party-happy kids what schools they got into, like Georgetown and Harvard. After school, Amy notices Molly is pissed, and she vents that she can't believe that their hard-partying peers got into the same good schools they did while they spent their time in high school only hitting the books. They know another student named Nick (Mason Gooding) is throwing a party that evening at his aunt's house before graduation the next day, and Molly wants to go so that they can say they had fun while they were in school. Although reluctant, Amy agrees to join her friend.The girls put on outfits and tell Amy's parents (Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte) that they are sleeping over at Amy's. After they leave the house, they call their wealthy classmate Jared (Skyler Gisondo) for a Lyft ride to the party. He instead takes them to a party on a yacht that he threw, which he claims to be better than Nick's party, but nobody is there except for the staff and their loony classmate Gigi (Billie Lourd). She gives the girls strawberries and invites them to party with her. While Molly tries to find a way to get to Nick's, Amy goes to the deck to talk to Gigi, who is smoking a joint. After being told by a staff member that she can't smoke, Gigi goes crazy and breaks a bottle before trying to jump off the ship with both girls, but only she ends up jumping in the water. Molly tells Jared that he shouldn't try to buy peoples' affection, and they call for another ride after she gets the address for a party from another classmate named Alan (Austin Crute).Another Lyft shows up, and it's Principal Brown doing his second job. In the car, the girls discuss the potential of Amy hooking up with Ryan, but she wouldn't know what to do since she is inexperienced. Molly pulls up a porn video on her phone as it is charging in the car. They listen to it with headphones, but Brown assumes they are listening to music and puts it on the stereo. He instead hears the squishing from the porno, and he leaves the girls elsewhere.They end up at the home of fellow student George (Noah Galvin), who is throwing a murder mystery party with Alan. He assigns Amy and Molly roles before they run into Gigi again after she SOMEHOW made it to the party from the yacht before the girls did. Gigi tells them that the strawberries were laced with a type of drug similar to ayahuasca. Moments later, the girls begin to experience a trip in which they see themselves as dolls dressed as the roles George gave them. Molly critiques her doll body's anatomy while Amy seems to dig it. The two of them try and compose themselves before they leave the house. On their way out, George suggests that Molly only wants to go to Nick's party because she has a crush on him. Molly admits this to Amy.While they come down from their trip, the girls see a video of Theo at the party karate-chopping a stack of pizza boxes. They decide to find the pizza place and find out the address from a delivery guy. They hop into the car of one driver (Mike O'Brien) and make it look like they are going to burglarize him by using their hair as masks. The driver calls them out on how stupid their plan is since he has a gun in his glove compartment and because he could be a serial killer or rapist. Molly asks for the address to the party, and he gives it to them before ordering them to get out of his car. Before they can call for another ride, Amy realizes she left her phone in the driver's car, while Molly's phone is at 2%. She uses it to call for a ride just before the phone dies.The girls are picked up by Ms. Fine, who proceeds to drive them to the party. She commends them on taking the night to have fun, as she didn't party in high school and overcompensated for it in her 20's, which she warns the girls not to do. Ms. Fine also gives them new clothes to change into.Upon arriving at the party, the girls split up to try and find their respective crushes. Molly plays beer pong with Nick and chats with him flirtatiously, while Amy finds Ryan and hangs out with her. They do karaoke for a while before Ryan invites Amy to go swimming. When she does, she finds Ryan and Nick kissing in the pool. Dismayed, she gets Molly and tries to leave, but Molly doesn't want to. Amy gets more upset and starts to argue with Molly in front of everyone, calling her out for always forcing her to do what she wants to do, while Molly hits back that Amy is a coward. Amy then reveals that she isn't just spending the summer abroad in Botswana, but she is taking a gap year to stay there, which Molly is only just finding out about. This hurts her as it throws off their schedules of graduating together and progressing as friends, so they angrily leave each other.Amy retreats to the bathroom to cry, where she finds mean girl Hope (Diana Silvers). As Hope says rotten things to her, Amy stands up to her and says she is only going to peak in high school. She then kisses Hope, leading to the two of them making out. They are about to have sex on the floor, but Amy messes up and eventually vomits on Hope. Meanwhile, Molly sees Nick with Ryan, finally realizing why Amy wanted to leave. She ends up finding Jared, who admits that he likes Molly a lot for how smart she is and how she doesn't have to try and prove anything to anyone else, while also telling her that Gigi is sad deep down, which is why she acts the way she does. Molly later walks outside as the cops arrive, forcing everyone to run out. Molly leaves after she can't find Amy. She walks home but is picked up by Triple A. Molly reluctantly gets in the car with her. She tells Molly that she got her nickname since she was said to give ""roadside assistance"" (blowjobs) to a guy. She admits to it, but doesn't like the reputation she's been given, nor does she like her nickname. Molly comes to an understanding with her and apologizes for using the name. She asks that they use her real name when they both go to Yale next year, which is Annabelle (although she isn't particularly fond of that name either). Back at the house, Amy is trapped with other teens that couldn't leave the house in time as the cops are searching the house. Amy tells them she is going to create a diversion, and she runs out to get the cops' attention.In the morning, Molly wakes up to see notifications on social media about Amy being a bad-ass. She sees a video of Amy getting arrested, so she heads to jail to bail Amy out before graduation. They apologize to each other for their behavior, and Molly says she can get Amy out since they have information on a criminal known as The Valley Strangler, as he is the pizza delivery guy they met. With mere minutes before graduation starts, the girls speed in Amy's car to the school, bursting through the gate before their fellow students, who cheer upon their arrival. Molly goes to the stage to deliver her speech, but not before kissing Jared in front of everyone. She then gives her speech, which everyone loves.Sometime later, Molly is helping Amy pack for her trip along with her parents. Hope shows up to Amy's house and forgives her for puking on her, and she even gives Amy her number so that they can hang out sometime. Amy gets excited while Molly is pleasantly surprised at this.Molly later drops Amy off at the airport after she gives Molly her car. They have a regular goodbye, with both of them appearing to tearfully go their separate ways. Molly starts to drive away, but Amy runs in front of the car to stop her. She hops back in and suggests they get pancakes before leaving, to which Molly readily agrees."

A mild-mannered Uber driver named Stu picks up a grizzled detective who is hot on the trail of a sadistic, bloodthirsty terrorist and finds himself thrust into a harrowing ordeal where he has to keep his wits, himself unharmed, and work with his passenger while maintaining his high-class rating. Vic Manning is an LAPD detective trying to catch the criminal who murdered his partner. He gets a tip-off to the whereabouts of the perpetrator but has to take an Uber to get there.

While one is obsessed with 5 star ratings, the other one is obsessed to nab a deadly drug lord. The driver at first is happy but gets angry when the trail keeps getting longer. His girlfriend has asked him to give her company but the cop refuses to let him go. Whereas on the other hand, the cop's daughter is annoyed as the cop is not able to spend time in her arts exhibition.—Fella_shibby@yahoo.com The film starts with Detectives Vic Manning (Dave Bautista) and Sara Morris (Karen Gillan) arriving at a hotel to catch notorious drug lord Oka Teijo (Iko Uwais). Teijo gets the drop on them and starts to fight Vic before running away. The detectives chase Teijo out of the hotel and into the streets. Morris gets close enough to catch Teijo, but as they fight for her gun, Teijo ends up shooting Morris in the abdomen. The crook gets away as Vic rushes to his partner's side to save her, but she soon dies.Six months later, we meet Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), who works at a sporting goods store while taking a side job as an Uber driver. He is forced to give a ride to his obnoxious boss Richie Sandusky (Jimmy Tatro), who runs his father's store and also gives him the unwanted nickname ""Stuber"". Stu is also investing in opening a spin class gym with his college friend Becca (Betty Gilpin), with whom he is in love. However, she is dating a superstar basketball player, and Stu is none too pleased. He also really needs to maintain a rating above four stars, or he loses the Uber gig, and typically, his rides do not go over well.Vic has been obsessing over catching Teijo and avenging Morris. Captain Angie McHenry (Mira Sorvino) tells Vic to let it go now that the case against Teijo is being bumped up to the feds. Vic later goes to get Lasik eye surgery before meeting with his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales). She invites him to her art gallery later that night, which he promises to attend even though he can't see anything. Nicole installs the Uber app on his phone to help him out.Vic later gets a call from his informant, Leon (Amin Joseph), who frantically tells Vic about a heroin drop with Teijo happening later that night. Vic jumps at the chance to get in on the case, and he heads to meet with Leon, but because he can't see, he drives all over the place, knocks things over, and finally drives into a construction hole. He then has no choice but to call for an Uber. Stu is that Uber driver, and he goes to pick Vic up and take him to Koreatown to meet with Leon.The two arrive at the warehouse where Leon is, but Vic finds that he is already dead. He takes Leon's phone, but he unknowingly leaves behind bloody footprints. From what he can see on the phone, Leon's last contact was someone by the name of Amber Titties (Amber Chardae Robinson)(but it's French and pronounced ""Tee-tee-ay""). Vic forces Stu to keep driving him, making Compton their next destination. Meanwhile, Stu gets a video call from Becca, who is pissed and drunk after seeing that her boyfriend has nude photos of other girls on there. She invites Stu to come over and comfort her, and he promises to be there after dealing with Vic.Stu brings Vic to a male strip club, and Vic makes Stu go inside with him. They meet Amber, who runs the place and is aggressive to one of the dancers, Felix (Steve Howey), for eating a sandwich when he has to look buff. Vic goes to talk to her about Leon, and she says that he was involved with a dealer named Amo Cortez (Rene Moran). Stu talks to Felix about Becca, revealing that they had sex a while back, but they both act like it was no big deal. Felix encourages him to express his feelings to her. Becca calls Stu again and says that her boyfriend called and sounded apologetic, so she is close to forgiving him, but still wants Stu to come over. However, Vic is not done with Stu and wants him to drive to Long Beach to find Amo. Stu begrudgingly joins him. Amber can then be seen calling someone to tell them about Stu and Vic.The guys go to a house where Vic enters to interrogate Amo and his buddies. He is enraged to find that they were smuggling drugs inside their dog, and he pulls the guy outside to arrest him. He places him in Stu's car and makes him think Stu is his partner. Vic even gives Stu a small gun to sell it. Amo quickly realizes Stu is just an Uber driver, and he attempts to escape by breaking through the window. Stu tries to stop him and accidentally shoots Amo in the leg. Vic starts to pry info from Amo, learning that a heroin drop is going down that night, but Amo passes out from shock before he can tell Vic where it's happening.Vic orders Stu to take him to a vet that knows him so that they can treat Amo's leg. After Amo wakes up, Vic tries to once again use brute force to get into out of him, but Stu opts for a different option: getting into Amo's phone and trying to send messages on Twitter that he wouldn't want his buddies to read (mostly about being a fan of Ryan Gosling and spreading rumors about his boss wearing diapers). Amo spills that the drop is happening after midnight at a storage yard. Just then, a group of Teijo's goons enters, and the leader holds Stu at gunpoint. They try to negotiate a swap of Stu for Amo, but Vic calls their bluff and knows they'll just kill all three of them to get rid of loose ends. Stu faints, and Vic starts to exchange fire with the goons. Amo gets killed before he and Stu take cover. Still being unable to see, Vic is only able to get any shots by hearing wherever Stu throws something. He misses on the leader, but Vic catches him after he steps on a cat's tail, and Vic puts a bullet in his head. Stu pukes and freaks out over all the dead bodies. They then flee the scene while still looking like crap, but Vic sends a text on the leader's phone to who he thinks is Teijo to make him think that Vic is dead. The text instead goes to McHenry, who is already at Nicole's art gallery.The two make it to the art show, and Vic makes a fool of himself by bumping into things and not even noticing Nicole's art. She meets Stu, and he shares his whole day dealing with her dad. Vic then goes to Nicole and asks her for the keys to their house for his storage unit, which she realizes is the only reason he showed up. She tells him off for being absent in her life and caring more about his job than the people in his own life. Vic leaves her with a gun for protection. Stu and Vic leave, and Vic throws a rock through a nearby shop to bring cops there (but also because he's mad).The guys go to the sporting goods store to get what Vic says is a few guns, but he really just grabs a bunch of stuff off the racks. Stu finally puts his foot down and calls Vic out for how he acts, telling him that he is scared of showing his emotions by hiding behind his masculinity, as well as him being a terrible dad to Nicole. The two then start fighting with items from around the store, like baseball bats and bicycles. They are then caught by Richie, who aims a crossbow at them. He makes fun of Stu again, but Stu then tells Richie off for the kind of person he is, and Stu quits on the spot. As he is leaving, Richie tries to convince him to stay because he considers Stu his best (and only) friend. Stu tries to say one nice thing to Richie before leaving for good.Stu drives Vic to the storage yard to catch Teijo. While staking out, Vic calls McHenry for backup. As this happens, Stu calls Becca and comes clean about his feelings for her, but he makes it sound like she put some kind of pressure on him to admit it to himself. Although she is still open to Stu coming over, he feels that they should just not talk to each other at all since he won't be able to ignore his feelings for her, but he will give her a call when he is ready. McHenry then shows up and reveals herself as a dirty cop to Vic. It turns out she and Teijo killed Leon and orchestrated the whole thing to get Vic framed for murder and off their tail. She shoots Vic once, but before she can kill him, Stu drives his car into her and slams her against a wall. Teijo and his goons spot them and begin to shoot and chase after the guys. Stu drives away while Vic regains his sight and is able to shoot at the bad guys. Stu throws a propane tank for Vic to shoot so it can blow up, and it works. Unfortunately, Stu's electric car runs out of battery, and Teijo catches up and slams his car into theirs, knocking it down a hill and forces the guys to run.Teijo finds the two as they run through a factory, and his wild shooting forces the employees out. The guys hide with the employees in a van, where they try to call multiple Ubers to get them out of there and to also make Teijo think that it's police backup. But one of the drivers blows the whole thing, and the drivers flee once Teijo starts shooting again. Vic and Teijo fight, with Stu failing to take a shot at Teijo before he knocks them both down. Nicole shows up after getting Vic's location off the Uber app, and shoots Teijo a couple of times before he gets a hold of the gun and attempts to shoot Nicole while Vic is down. Stu takes the bullet for Nicole, and Vic rages out by trying to strangle Teijo before Nicole stops him as real cops show up to arrest Teijo.Stu and Vic both wake up in the hospital. Nicole thanks the two of them for what they did. Stu gets up to leave, but not before Vic gives him a five-star rating. He thanks Stu for saving Nicole's life, and it brings him to tears.It is now Christmas time. Becca opened the spin class gym on her own, which Stu remains an investor in, and it is a big success. Vic is seen eating in a Chinese restaurant with the dog he saved from Amo's house. He walks it to Nicole's house, where she reveals that she and Stu are now dating. Vic is left speechless as he comes in to celebrate with them, as the movie closes on a 5 star wreath (referencing Stu's recent success)."

They swim into Sasha and Nicole again, and they tell them about the shark.The shark attacks the girls, but since it is blind, it uses its hearing senses to find them. It crashes into the columns and leaves the girls trapped for a moment. Once they get free, Mia and Sasha suggest they find Grant and Carl using a guideline that will lead them to where they were working. The girls swim through catacombs and see that the line ends there. Regardless, they continue to swim forward while also minding the fact that the oxygen in their tanks is running low. The shark then pops out again, forcing them to hide behind a cage for protection. They escape by making it through a passageway too narrow for the shark to fit through. They make it into an air pocket to get oxygen back while trying to figure out their next move. Mia swims down and sees a gap that she can fit through and she goes for it.Mia swims nearby where Carl is working and listening to music. Unfortunately, he doesn't see the shark and promptly becomes its next meal. An emergency alarm then goes off as he is being shredded. Mia hears more music and finds herself alone and scared as she comes across Carl's remains. She eventually finds Grant, and the two go together to find the other girls. They are attacked by the shark again, and they fend it off using the sounds of a nearby bell, plus a blowtorch. The five reach the surface in the cave and use the alarm to scare the shark off temporarily.Grant points out a harness at the top for them to climb out of. Alexa starts to ascend first, but the sharks come to surface and Nicole panics, and jumps up to climb ahead of her. The harness starts to come loose with their combined weight, and although Nicole reaches the top, she slips and falls back down into the water before being quickly killed by two sharks.Grant and the girls then figure they need to swim to a nearby gap to get out of there, but the shark gets Grant moments later and killed, leaving Mia and Sasha devastated. They swim together with Alexa to try and get out of there. They come across a current that pulls Sasha away from Mia and Alexa. The shark finds them again and attacks Alexa, but evades it. However, she loses of oxygen tank and scuba mask, then she soon drowns.Mia finds Sasha and they end up swimming to the surface. They find a boat and try to signal it. It turns out to be the boat that they would have gotten on to see the sharks. Someone on the boat is listening to music and can't hear the girls calling, and he dumps chum into the water for the sharks. This lures a few more sharks in that direction. Mia and Sasha bang on the glass where the guests can see them, and they run to alert the crew. Mia makes it up on the boat, but Sasha gets pulled in by a shark. Mia grabs a flare gun and jumps in to save Sasha by firing the flare at the shark's face. Just as they get back, another shark grabs Mia and pulls her in. She frees herself by taking the shark tooth and slicing across the shark's side to injure it, freeing herself. The people on the boat pull Mia in before another shark can get her, (By the end, Mia and Sasha are remaining survivors after being an dreadful experience).The girls receive medical attention, but Mia and Sasha are just glad that they still have each other."

'Black and Blue' is an action thriller about a rookie cop (Naomie Harris) who inadvertently captures the murder of a young drug dealer on her body cam. After realizing that the murder was committed by corrupt cops, she teams up with the one person from her community who is willing to help her (Tyrese Gibson) as she tries to escape both the criminals out for revenge and the police who are desperate to destroy the incriminating footage.—Sony Pictures In New Orleans, Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is out for a jog when she is stopped by two cops. They harass her and think she is a suspect they have been looking for until they see she is also an officer. One of the cops apologizes, but Alicia (a black woman) is used to this type of treatment by racist white cops. She continues her run and stops to visit her mother's tomb.Alicia begins her day at work with her partner, Kevin Jennings (Reid Scott). They drive around Kingston, which was Alicia's old neighborhood before she left to join the army. They pull over into a convenience store that had been robbed the day before (the police just ""didn't"" get the call), and Alicia talks to a young boy, Jamal. His mother, Missy (Nafessa Williams), sends him away, as she used to be friends with Alicia but hasn't taken kindly to her having joined the police force. She is antagonized by a gang member until he sees Kevin and walks away. The officers then go into the shop, owned by Missy's brother Mouse (Tyrese Gibson), who is also rather cold toward Alicia because of her new life. Regardless, he lets the officers take what they want for free.Alicia is assigned to ride with veteran officer Deacon Brown (James Moses Black). They ride to an altercation at a nightclub. As Alicia attempts to detain one subject, Brown catches another one attempting to murder Alicia. He grabs and pins him to the car before pulling his own gun on him. Alicia tries to diffuse the situation until Brown shows her the suspect's gun. After taking him into custody, Alicia and Brown sit for coffee, and he tells her that the people in that neighborhood won't have her back just because she's black, and view her as more of an enemy because she's a cop.The next day, Brown takes Alicia outside a warehouse but orders her to stay in the car. She gets out when she spots what appears to be a drug deal, but the buyer runs away. Alicia then hears a gunshot from inside the warehouse. She goes in to find Brown with narcotics detectives Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) and Smitty (Beau Knapp). They are interrogating a young man named Zero (John Charles II) and two other dealers. He pleads with Malone and says that they will silence any word of their corruption, but Malone executes all three men. Alicia witnesses the act, and it is caught on her body cam. The men spot her, and Brown tries to keep things together before Smitty shoots at Alicia and sends her crashing through the floor. Realizing her body cam will incriminate them, the men rush to find her, but Alicia has already run, injured from a gunshot. The men see that she dropped her gun and is running around unarmed. They proceed to chase her through the streets. When she attempts to contact dispatch, Malone tells the operator that Alicia is just a rookie who got spooked during a drug bust.Alicia comes across Officer Doyle (Nelson Bonilla), who appears to try and help her, but she overhears on her radio from Doyle's partner that they are working with Malone. Alicia runs away again and goes around the neighborhood trying to get help, but true to Brown's words, not a single person dares to help her. Alicia continues to run until she makes it into Mouse's shop. He finds her and attempts to get her out by calling the cops. Alicia hides as Doyle and his partner get there. Doyle harasses Mouse and intimidates him with his gun. Doyle's partner runs his license and sees Mouse's priors, but he doesn't report it to Doyle and they let him go. Mouse is visibly shaken up from the encounter. He agrees to help Alicia.Alicia contacts Kevin to help get her out of there. He picks her up and drives away with her. After she explains her situation, Alicia suggests bringing Internal Affairs in on the case. Kevin lets it slip that he knew Malone was the culprit, which alerts Alicia to Kevin's complicity in the other officers' crimes. She fights him and gets out, forcing her to keep running. Mouse takes her to his apartment to shelter her.It becomes known that Zero was the nephew of Kingston Crew's boss Darius Tyrell (Mike Colter). He talks to Malone, who is in league with him, and the dirty cop tells Darius that Alicia went crazy and shot Zero and his friends before running away. Darius spreads word that Alicia killed Zero, which even Jamal sees. He goes into Alicia's room with a gun, but she draws hers on him. Mouse comes in to stop Jamal and sees what Darius sent him. Meanwhile, Brown and Malone try to cover their tracks with Captain Hackett (Deneen Tyler), insisting they go after Alicia. Malone goes with Smitty to the convenience store to find security footage of Mouse helping Alicia.Mouse tries to help Alicia get out, but they are found by Darius's goons. They kill two of them, but knowing that more are coming, Mouse gives Alicia a chance to get away while he gets captured by the thugs.

After entering the building, she is attacked by Darius, but Alicia quickly tells him about the body cam. After they find it, Darius's other nephew uploads the footage to the computer, thereby giving everyone concrete proof that Malone killed Zero.

Hellboy is a supernatural being who is the son of a fallen angel. He came to our world in 1944 as a result of a mystical ritual. The Occultists of the Third Reich had long tried to gain an advantage in the war, hoping to attract the ideal soldier to the ranks of the fascist army. Hellboy was exactly the one they needed, but they never managed to make their plans a reality. The demon from hell fell into the hands of Americans and began to serve them, protecting the world from mysterious threats. This time he is sent to England to meet face to face with Merlin's wife. Just a battle with the Blood Queen will lead to the end of the world, which the monster tried to avoid all his life.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) Having spent decades fighting evil as a member of the top-secret Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, humankind's unlikely defender Hellboy now crosses paths with an old adversary bent on revenge. And as the defeated evil sorceress Nimue, the undying Queen of Blood, takes the world by surprise, the infernal avenger and his justice team embark on a peril-laden quest to thwart the witch's dark scheme and avert doomsday. Now, to realise his full potential, the troubled hornless demon has to pick sides. But the question remains. Is Hellboy still one of the good guys?—Nick Riganas In the Dark Ages, the Blood Queen Nimue (Milla Jovovich) (A powerful and ancient medieval British sorceress who seeks to destroy mankind) unleashes a plague on England until King Arthur (Mark Stanley) stops her with the aid of Ganeida (Penelope Mitchell) (An elder witch who has decided that Nimue's wrath has gone on for too long and must be stopped), a member of her coven. Arthur uses Excalibur to dismember Nimue, and hides her remains across England.In present day Tijuana, Mexico, paranormal investigator Hellboy (David Harbour) (An immensely powerful Cambion who works for the government organization Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.)) reluctantly kills missing Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.) agent Esteban Ruiz, whose mission got him turned into a vampire. After hearing Ruiz's dying words that the end is coming, Hellboy is brought back to the B.P.R.D. in Colorado. He is assigned by B.P.R.D. leader Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane), his adoptive human father, to assist in the Osiris Club, a secret society that studies the occult, in their hunt for three giants. Hellboy is informed by the club's seer Lady Hatton (Sophie Okonedo) that Bruttenholm was meant to kill him when he first came into the world as the result of the Nazis' Project Ragnarok back in 1945 (Hellboy was working for the Nazis when he summoned Hellboy, but was killed by allied forces once the ceremony was completed. Bruttenholm was part of the allied party who rescued Hellboy and decided to convert him into a force of good). Meanwhile, the hog-like fairy Gruagach (Stephen Graham and Douglas Tait) (A hog-like fairy who restored Nimue to exact revenge on Hellboy) retrieves several of Nimue's remains.During the hunt, Hellboy is betrayed and nearly killed by the Osiris hunters (the giants were a ruse to lure Hellboy to UK. In reality the Osiris club recognized Helloby as the ""end of the world"" threat to humans and wanted to kill him before he could turn on them) before they are ambushed by the giants. Barely conscious, Hellboy manages to defeat the giants before being rescued by a young woman. Hellboy awakens in the woman's flat and recognizes her as Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane) (who retained some magical abilities after she was kidnapped by fairies as a baby), a medium he once rescued from fairies as a baby. Sending a SWAT team to retrieve Hellboy, Bruttenholm relays that someone has taken Nimue's remains and is seeking the last piece at the Osiris Club. They are introduced to M11 agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) (A rugged Japanese-American military member of the B.P.R.D. who, due to a supernatural encounter, can turn into a jaguar when angered or in pain), and Hellboy and Alice join the team headed to the club.
Finding everyone at the club slaughtered, Alice channels Hatton's spirit, who reveals that Nimue seeks Hellboy to cause the apocalypse. Nimue's arm is taken by Gruagach, and Nimue distracts Hellboy by appealing to his frustrations, allowing Gruagach to escape. Hellboy reveals that Gruagach is a changeling who took baby Alice's place before Hellboy branded him with iron. Gruagach, with the guidance of witch Baba Yaga (Emma Tate and Troy James), revives Nimue to exact revenge on Hellboy for ruining his chance of being human.Daimio takes them to M11 headquarters before secretly acquiring a special bullet to kill Hellboy. After an argument with Bruttenholm about his adoption (Hellboy is not convinced why Bruttenholm kills every monster that walks the earth and yet decided to spare his life when he had the chance. He wants a world where monsters can live peacefully), Hellboy leaves before being magically transported to Baba Yaga's house. Having shot out Baba Yaga's right eye, Hellboy is talked into giving up one of his eyes for the location where Nimue plans to restore herself.

Nimue poisons Alice and flees with Gruagach; Ganeida directs Hellboy to the resting place of the wizard Merlin (Brian Gleeson) to save Alice. Hellboy and Daimio excavate Merlin's still-living body, and Merlin cures Alice before putting her and Daimio to sleep. Merlin tells Hellboy that he is descendant of King Arthur through his mother who was spirited to Hell by his father. When offered Excalibur, Hellboy refuses it after a vision of himself causing the apocalypse. Merlin, having exhausted his magic, disintegrates.The trio return to London to find the M11 staff dead and Bruttenholm missing. They follow Nimue to St Paul's Cathedral, and Hellboy fights an empowered Gruagach aided by Daimio in were-jaguar form. Nimue kills Gruagach, and knocks Hellboy into Arthur's hidden tomb that holds Excalibur. Hellboy initially refuses to pull the sword, but reneges when Nimue kills Bruttenholm. The sword's removal opens a portal to Hell from which demons emerge and attack London. Alice channels Bruttenholm's spirit to dissuade Hellboy and he decapitates Nimue, throwing her head into the closing portal after the demons are sent back to hell. Hellboy and Bruttenholm exchange farewells, and Daimio discards the special bullet.Six months later, the trio raid a cult club where they find the water tank of an Ichthyo sapiens. In a mid-credits scene, Hellboy is consoled at Bruttenholm's grave by the ghost of his hero Lobster Johnson (Thomas Haden Church). In a post-credits scene, Baba Yaga enlists an unseen force to seek out Hellboy with the promise of allowing him to finally die."
Shaft,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4463894/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"JJ Shaft, a cyber security expert with a degree from MIT, enlists his family's help to uncover the truth behind his best friend's untimely death. JJ, aka John Shaft Jr. (Usher), may be a cyber security expert with a degree from MIT, but to uncover the truth behind his best friend's untimely death, he needs an education only his dad can provide. Absent throughout JJ's youth, the legendary locked-and-loaded John Shaft (Jackson) agrees to help his progeny navigate Harlem's heroin-infested underbelly. And while JJ's own FBI analyst's badge may clash with his dad's trademark leather coat, there's no denying family. Besides, Shaft's got an agenda of his own, and a score to settle that's professional and personal. A young male who works for the FBI tracks down his father to help him reveal the truth behind his best friend's death. Along the journey, they discover the real truth of a hidden cartel that commits all sorts of crimes in secret and targeting specific people.—RECB3 Harlem, New York City, 1989Private detective John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) is arguing with his girlfriend Maya Babanikos (Regina Hall) in the streets, just before they are approached by some armed criminals. Shaft spots them and protects Maya as the thugs open fire on their car. He exits the car and shoots the thugs dead, before finding that one of them is carrying drugs pushed by the ruthless drug lord Pierro ""Gordito"" Carrera (Isaach De Bankole). Shaft goes back to Maya, and it is revealed that their baby son, John Jr (or JJ), was sitting in the backseat, but thankfully unharmed. The two agree that the life Shaft lives is too dangerous for them as a family, and they must part ways.Over the next 25 years, Shaft remains invisible from JJ's life, but still tries to acknowledge him by sending him gifts (like a Super Bowl ring and a box of condoms). JJ (now played by Jessie T. Usher) has gotten by with his friends Sasha Arias (Alexandra Shipp) and Karim Hassan (Avan Jogia). He graduates from MIT and becomes a cybersecurity expert for the FBI. Special Agent Vietti (Titus Welliver) briefs the others on the need for extra surveillance on the Rashad Azzam Mosque and its Imam Farik Bahar (Amato D'Apolito) since he is deemed suspicious due to frequent trips to Afghanistan, but they want to keep it from appearing as an Islamophobic investigation. JJ wants in on the case, but Vietti refuses to put him on since he is unqualified.JJ meets with Sasha and Karim in a bar. Karim, now a former marine and recovering addict, tells them about a program called Brothers Watching Brothers that is dedicated to helping vets who have struggled with addiction. Karim then abruptly leaves, and JJ goes after him to make sure he is okay. He assures JJ that he is fine, and he thanks him for always supporting him. In the morning, Maya calls JJ and tells him that Karim has been found dead.Karim's funeral is held, with his friends, family, and fellow marines mourning him. JJ looks into the crime scene report on Karim's death, which states that he was found dead from an apparent overdose outside the building of a known drug dealer named Manny Orozco (Ian Casselberry). He goes around the area and learns from a neighborhood kid of Manny's location. JJ approaches them but is knocked out by one of Manny's goons after asking about Karim. He wakes up in the hospital and is tended by Sasha, who is a nurse. He tells her that Manny is never going to talk to him or a cop about Karim, so he has to find the one guy who will make him talk.JJ goes to his father's office and meets him for the first time. Although their encounter is tense, JJ admits that he needs his father's help in solving the case. Shaft sees that JJ has been hit, and JJ says it was one of Manny's goons. Shaft takes JJ back to the building where he takes down Manny's goons and shoots them in the legs before finding Manny, who already knows Shaft. After learning that he assaulted Shaft's son, Manny runs into the streets, but Shaft causes a truck to stop and make Manny run into it. Shaft breaks Manny's hand as he gets him to give up info on Karim, and he mentions the Brothers Watching Brothers team.On the way to the rehab center where BWB is located, Shaft and JJ clash over the fact that Shaft is so abrasive and violent while JJ is more soft and timid by comparison. They arrive and meet Karim's friends Major Gary Cutworth, or ""Cutty"" (Matt Lauria), Sgt. Keith Williams (Robbie Jones), and Staff Sgt. Eddie Dominguez (Aaron Dominguez). They mention that Karim became more religious after he started attending the Rashad Mosque, which is where he met his girlfriend Anam (Almeera Jiwa). Dominguez appears uncomfortable with mentioning Karim, so the two leave, but Shaft seems suspicious.Shaft later takes JJ to a nightclub to loosen up. He introduces his son to two party girls Baby (Chivonne Michelle) and Sugar (Tashiana Washington), and he soon gets drunk. Shaft goes to talk to his informant buddy Freddy P (Method Man), but they soon watch JJ getting into a fight with another guy. The very inebriated JJ manages to win the fight due to knowing capoeira, making him look cool in front of everyone...until he completely ruins the moment by barfing on both Baby and Sugar. Shaft brings him home and brings him to bed.In the morning, Shaft and a hungover JJ meet with Sasha to enter the mosque to talk to Anam. They are confronted by Farik, who is Anam's father. After he sees that JJ is FBI, he orders the three of them out of there. Later, JJ investigates the Mosque's funds and sees that half a million dollars was made into an account from a recently opened supermarket. JJ tries to bring this info to Vietti, but he puts JJ on administrative leave for meddling in the investigation.Shaft and JJ go to the market and meet with the manager, Bennie (Luna Lauren Velez). She knocks JJ in the face before Shaft takes his gun out to get info out of Bennie. She tells them that she is just supporting the Mosque. However, after reviewing some surveillance photos, Shaft recognizes Bennie in pictures with Gordito, leading him and JJ to suspect that the supermarket is a front for Gordito's drug operation, along with possible terrorist connections with Farik's Afghanistan trips. JJ also reveals that he planted a micro camera in Bennie's desk to keep an eye on her.Later that night, Shaft goes to a restaurant where Maya is on a date with a dorky man named Ron (Leland L. Jones). She becomes flustered at his presence and thinks he is trying to crash the place to get her back. Sure enough, he is sitting at their table talking to Ron. Moments later, Shaft spots gunmen entering, and they begin to open fire on the place. Shaft protects Maya before shooting at the goons and killing them. At the same time, JJ is out to dinner with Sasha, and they are also targeted by gunmen. Sasha watches as JJ gets her gun and fires at the bad guys, killing them all. Shaft makes Ron give him his car keys as they go with Maya to the restaurant where JJ and Sasha are, and Maya is furious to learn that Shaft has been seeing JJ behind her back. JJ pulls a phone off a dead goon and calls the employer's number. With his camera, he sees that it was Bennie who ordered the hit on the Shafts.The FBI make a raid on the Mosque and arrest Farik, which draws criticism that the FBI launched an Islamophobic attack. Vietti fires JJ after the mess that transpires. He then goes to overhear Shaft talking to Freddy, who gives him information on Dominguez being involved in the operation, but JJ walks in when it sounds like them talking about JJ as a nuisance that he can ditch after the case is done. He angrily walks away from his father. This prompts Shaft to rethink his actions, so he goes to apologize to Maya for his absence and behavior, but he ruins it by asking for sex.JJ and Sasha head over to the BWB center to investigate Dominguez, who is revealed to be Bennie's cousin. JJ enters and sees Cutty, Dominguez, and Williams meeting, and he records it on his phone. Cutty is heard talking about being involved with Gordito, and that Karim attempting to be a whistle blower is what got him killed. Cutty sees that Dominguez is having second thoughts, so he kills him for getting soft. JJ makes noise and is spotted. He and Sasha are caught outside, and Cutty and Williams take her hostage. Shaft later arrives at the crime scene where he and JJ confront one another. Shaft tells him that he never wanted to abandon him, but Gordito's attempt on their lives made it hard for him to keep their family together, and that's why his vendetta against Gordito is so personal.Shaft and JJ visit the home of the only other person who can help them... John Shaft, Sr (Richard Roundtree). He is stunned to meet JJ for the first time, as is JJ. Shaft Sr supplies his son and grandson with guns to go after Gordito and Cutty, but he insists on joining in on the action.The three Shafts arrive at Gordito's building where he is meeting with Cutty and Williams over a new shipment of heroin. JJ attempts to hack the cameras to avoid detection, but the lack of wi-fi leads to a glitch. Thinking quickly, the three get out of the elevator after they are spotted by Gordito's men, and they break in through the window to begin fighting the villains. Gordito's henchmen are killed, as is Williams, before JJ fights Cutty. Before Cutty can shoot JJ, he stabs Cutty in the leg with glass before shooting him dead. Gordito then has the men and Sasha at gunpoint, where he tells Shaft that JJ was always his target in an attempt to spite Shaft for meddling in his operation. Shaft jumps to take the shot meant for JJ, and Shaft Sr throws a knife at Gordito. The drug lord is then shot by Shaft multiple times before being blasted out a window to his demise. Shaft then loses consciousness from blood loss.Shaft wakes up in the hospital with JJ, Shaft Sr, and Maya there by his side. Maya is more forgiving of Shaft due to his protection of JJ. JJ then goes to finally kiss Sasha, making his dad and granddad proud.JJ returns to the FBI with a standing ovation for his work. Vietti is ready to welcome him back and promote him, but JJ tells him he is not returning and is instead going to work full time with his father and grandfather. He joins them as they walk off into the streets in style."

The team then reviews their data to find that Fleming is the one who took the other Callisto prototypes. They track him to Istanbul and make plans to find him there. Later, Boz meets with an unseen figure to let her know about Istanbul, and she asks what they do with Elena.The Saint equips the team with gadgets as they head to Istanbul. In order to find out where Fleming is planning to sell off Callisto, Jane gets help from a woman from her past named Fatima (Marie-Lou Sellem), who used to take care of Jane but was hurt by her after she left without a word. Fatima relents and helps her, which leads the team to find Fleming and follow him. Boz learns he plans to sell Callisto the next day at the Turkish Derby. The team heads to the Derby that day to keep an eye on Fleming, following him to a rock quarry. They discover that Fleming is selling to Smith, with Hodak present for the meeting. Smith asks for a demonstration, but when Fleming finds it too risky to pull off safely, Hodak shoots him in the head. The team is compromised, and they must fight off the other assassins. Smith and Hodak get away, and Boz is also gone as the ladies try calling her for help.The ladies return to the safe house where they suspect Boz might be a mole in the agency. Elena gets a call from John warning them to get out of there. An explosion goes off and forces them to run. Elena is found outside by Boz, who appears to be aiming her gun at her, but she is shot down by John. He takes Elena with him for safety.Sabina recovers from her injuries, with Jane worrying by her side. The Saint brings Boz in, and she clears the air about what the team thinks of her. She had to leave because she knew John was the real traitor, and since she has tracked him and found out he was in Istanbul, she had to find him before he got to the other ladies. They realize Elena is in danger, and Boz states that John is trying to establish his own network of criminals after being passed over to succeed Charlie. They plan to sneak into a party that Brock is throwing for his investors to present Callisto.Elena learns that John is the bad guy and is ordered by him to program Callisto to his needs. When she refuses, he shows her that he is keeping Langston as a hostage. Sabina and Jane get in dressed as party guests. Brock and Hodak meet with John, where John reveals to Brock that he is not the one in control as he thought. John forces Elena to reprogram Callisto for his use and then tries to trigger the EMP to kill her and Langston. After he leaves, Elena frees herself and Langston. Sabina and Jane find Hodak and fight him. Jane takes him one-on-one and throws him over the balcony where he is impaled on an ice sculpture. The team then stands off against John and his men, but Boz gets other Angels disguised as party-goers to subdue the henchmen, and Sabina punches John's lights out. Smith is then revealed to be Boz's informant who worked to bring John down. The team then leaves, with Langston following them.During the end credits, Brock is shown to be arrested. Elena is officially recruited as an Angel by classic Angel Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith), who has been using a voice simulator to speak as Charlie. Elena is trained by multiple instructors (Danica Patrick, Ronda Rousey, Laverne Cox) and joins other recruits (Hailee Steinfeld, Lili Reinhart, Aly Raisman, Chloe Kim) in an air jump, but Boz tells her to land the plane. Elena does so safely and rejoins Sabina and Jane."

The Farewell,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8637428/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Chinese family discovers their grandmother has only a short while left to live and decide to keep her in the dark, scheduling a wedding to gather before she dies. A headstrong Chinese-American woman returns to China when her beloved grandmother is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Billi struggles with her family's decision to keep grandma in the dark about her own illness as they all stage an impromptu wedding to see grandma one last time. Billi and her parents Haiyan and Jian emigrated to New York City from their native Changchun, China twenty-five years ago when Billi was only six. Billi is struggling finding her place in life and by association financially, she aspiring to be a writer, but the Guggenheim fellowship for which she applied and on which she placed much of her hopes has been denied. Billi maintains a close relationship with her paternal grandmother - her ""Nai Nai"" - back in Changchun via the occasional visit and frequent telephone calls. As is Chinese custom, Billi and Nai Nai tell each other little white lies both to save face and to prevent the other from worrying about the painful truth. Those little white lies turn into one big lie when Haiyan and his older brother Haibin, who emigrated to Japan years ago, learn that Nai Nai has just been diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer with the prognosis of only months to live, the diagnosis and prognosis which they and the rest of their extended family that know decide to keep from Nai Nai herself. In a guise to spend one last time together as a family with Nai Nai, they devise a wedding, that of Haibin's only offspring, Hao Hao, to Aiko, his Japanese girlfriend of three months, as an event, with Nai Nai to be the chief organizer in Changchun. Haiyan and Jian don't want Billi to go to the fake wedding in being the weak link that may tell Nai Nai the truth in her western mores. Against her parents' wishes, Billi does end up flying to Changchun for the gathering in her want to say goodbye to her Nai Nai. As time goes on, it may be difficult not only for Billi but for others to maintain the ruse. But Billi and the others may also come to a better perspective of what is best for all concerned under the circumstances.—Huggo While trying to find her place in the world and establish herself as a writer, Billi, a young Chinese-American woman living in New York City, discovers that her beloved and seemingly indestructible grandmother, Nai Nai, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. As a result, to spare Nai Nai the agony, Billi's family decides to keep the unsuspecting lady in the dark, going as far as to stage an impromptu wedding in her hometown of Changchun, China, to unite the scattered relatives and keep suspicion at bay. Now, for fear of not keeping her promise to maintain the lie, conflicted Billi's parents ask her to stay in the United States. However, Billi needs to say good-buy. Can she reconcile the contradictions between the Western lifestyle and the Chinese cultural beliefs with her ideals?—Nick Riganas The movie opens with a card stating it's ""based on a true lie.""Billi (Awkwafina) lives in New York with her parents Haiyan (Tzi Ma) and Jian (Diana Lin) but remains pretty close to her grandmother in China, Nai Nai (Shuzehen Zhou) and talk on the phone all the time. Billi gets a call from Nai Nai in the morning in NYC and gets fussed over like all grandmas do over their grand kids. What Nai Nai doesn't tell her is, she's in the hospital for some tests accompanied by her sister, Little Nai Nai (Hong Lu). They agree they'll talk later and Nai Nai goes for a CT scan. Her sister goes to talk to the doctor afterwards and then tells Nai Nai there's nothing wrong, just ""some benign shadows.""Billi is not really doing well in her life, and while on the phone with Nai Nai later on that day, she opens a letter that says her application for a Guggenheim fellowship has been rejected. She keeps this information from Nai Nai and everybody else.Billi goes to visit her parents and her mom gives her grief over the fact she doesn't have any money or seems to be moving forward with her life. She also tells her she and Haiyan are leaving for China the next day because their nephew Hao Hao is getting married to Aiko (who is Japanese and doesn't speak Chinese) and Billi is not to accompany them. When Billi questions why the wedding is so rushed, Jian hushes her as Hayan is sleeping. Billi asks why, since it's only 6:00PM, but Jian waves her off.Billi then goes in the bedroom where her father is sitting on the bed. She asks what's wrong because she can tell something is not right, and questions whether he's been drinking, which he denies. Hayan eventually tells her Nai Nai has stage four lung cancer and the wedding is just an excuse for everybody to go over there and see her. Billi says she must go, but her parents refuse. Jian says they're not telling Nai Nai about her condition because in China families believe if you tell someone they have cancer, they die, not because of the disease but of the fear. The reason they don't want her to go is, Billi's emotions show on her face and Nai Nai will know something is wrong.Billi eventually shows up in China, much to her parents' dismay and Nai Nai's delight. Jian questions once again where Billi got the money for the plane ticket, but Billi doesn't reply, and shows her instead she can hide her feelings. From then on, it's all about the wedding planning and the differences between America and China, with Jian and YuPing (a distant relative) sniping back and forth about life opportunities in the two countries. Nai Nai cuts the arguments short by saying they can't criticize China, no matter what.Nai Nai teaches Billi some form of walking/breathing exercise that involves grunting out loud ""so you can do it alone when you go back to America."" Billi struggles with the ""we're not telling Nai Nai she has cancer"" thing and keeps bringing it up, only to be shut down again and again. Eventually, after an evening of heavy drinking by the immediate family, Nai Nai goes to the hospital after a coughing attack. Once again, Billy brings up with the doctor the situation with Nai Nai, and he also advises against telling her about her condition. He tells Nai Nai the cough is leftover from the pneumonia she'd had earlier in the year and it's a secondary infection. He agrees to change her medicine and orders an X-ray.Billi finds her father and uncle Haibin (Yongbo Jiang) smoking at the hotel where they're all staying, and she brings up the lying again. Haibin explains that the difference between living in America and in China is that in America people believe their life belong to themselves, whereas in China people's lives are part of a whole, of a family, of society, and therefore it is the family's duty to carry the emotional burden of the cancer knowledge FOR Nai Nai.Billi tells her mother she wants to stay in China to take care of Nai Nai but Jian is not having it and once again berates her daughter since she ""can't cook, can't clean, what are you going to do?"" Billi brings up she couldn't come to China when her grandpa (Ye Ye in Mandarin) died and how that affected her. Jian once again dismisses her.Before the wedding, Nai Nai asks Billi to be nice and courteous with the wedding guests, smiling and greeting them and agreeing to sing if called to do so. On the wedding day, after arguing with her sister for having to wait until Monday for her X-ray results, Nai Nai gets Billi's attention and gestures for her to smile, so Billi does what she's been asked to do and is nice to everybody. However, at the time of the speeches, Haibin, father of the groom, goes up on stage and basically loses it and starts crying which he attributes to being ""very happy."" Billi also goes up on stage and makes a speech, aided by her dad who tells her the Mandarin Chinese for ""congratulations."" They also do karaoke together to ""Killing Me Softly."" After a raucous drinking game, Hao Hao starts crying inconsolably.When the time comes for the family picture with the bride and groom, Nai Nai questions why the groom is crying and once again she's told ""tears of joy."" Little Nai Nai asks if they can take one with her camera, which Nai Nai says she gave to Mrs Gao (their maid) to hold. When Little Nai Nai asks where Mrs Gao is, Nai Nai says she sent her to the hospital to get the X-ray results.As soon as the picture is taken, Billi hightails it to the hospital to intercept Mrs Gao, which he does, only to realize Mrs Gao is illiterate and doesn't know what the test results are. Then Billi and Little Nai Nai take the results to a shop to have them altered to read ""benign shadows."" When the shop employee questions what that means, Little Nai Nai snaps, ""It's not terminal!""Nai Nai gets the test results and tells them all off, ""you worried for nothing! I told you I was fine!"" After that, she meets with Billi before she leaves and gives her an envelope with money, because she'd given one to Hao Hao so Billi gets one too. When Billi opposes, as she didn't get married, Nai Nai says that's more the reason for her to accept it, and to not spend it on something sensible like the rent, but to get herself something nice. Billi then confesses to Nai Nai she missed out on the fellowship, and Nai Nai advises that it's not so much what you do in life, but the way you do it.Billi and her parents are leaving and Nai Nai hugs Billi for the longest time before letting her go and assuring her they'll see each other again. Billi is back in New York City, unsure of what to do, and while walking down the street, she stops in her tracks and grunts loudly, like Nai Nai taught her. The movie ends.We're shown a video of the actual Nai Nai, who's still going strong six years after her stage four cancer diagnosis."

Late Night,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6107548/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A late night talk show host suspects that she may soon lose her long-running show. Katherine Newbury (Dame Emma Thompson) is a pioneer and legendary host on the late-night talk-show circuit. When she's accused of being a ""woman who hates women"", she puts affirmative action on the to-do list, and presto. Molly (Mindy Kaling) is hired as the one woman in Katherine's all-male writers' room. But Molly might be too little, too late, as the formidable Katherine also faces the reality of low ratings and a network that wants to replace her. Wanting to prove she's not merely a diversity hire who's disrupting the comfort of the brotherhood, Molly is determined to help Katherine revitalize her show and career--and possibly effect even bigger change at the same time. The film starts with award-winning talk show host Katherine Newbury (Emma Thompson) starting a new episode of her acclaimed, long-running program. In addition to her decades-long career in television, Katherine is happily married to Walter Lovell (John Lithgow), a beloved writer who is currently suffering from the early stages of Parkinsons disease.Katherine and her assistant Brad (Denis O'Hare) meet with one of the show's writers, Gabe Eichler (Lucas Caleb Rooney), who requests a raise due to the fact that his wife just had a baby, and they could use the extra money. Katherine refuses and doesn't think Gabe is deserving of a raise for his work, even comparing his baby to a drug problem that he is depending on for money. She fires Gabe, but before he leaves, he calls her out and says that her feminist tirades are bullshit since she hates other women. Katherine tries to defend herself to Brad, but even he feels that she may have some kind of issue with women. She then demands that a female be hired to the writing staff.Molly Patel (Mindy Kaling) arrives at the studio for an interview. Originally coming from Philadelphia as a chemical plant employee, she hopes to be chosen as part of the writing staff, as she is a huge fan of Katherine's show and earlier career in comedy. Brad interviews Molly, who is bombing the interview, but a phone call from Katherine demanding a female writer gets Molly hired on the spot.Katherine is surprised in her dressing room by the network's president, Caroline Morton (Amy Ryan). She informs Katherine that since her show has seen declining ratings over the last decade, as well as Katherine's refusal to appeal beyond her usual demographic, this year will be her last on the show, and she will be replaced soon unless the writers find a way to revamp the show for a broader audience.Katherine and Brad meet with the writers team - Mancuso (Paul Walter Hauser), Reynolds (John Early), Kastner (Mark Kudisch), Hayes (Luke Slattery), Burditt (Max Casella), Charlie Fain (Hugh Dancy), and Tom Campbell (Reid Scott). She can't be bothered to learn their names, so she refers to them by numbers. Molly enters late, and the others are stunned at the presence of a woman in the room. She awkwardly makes her way to find a seat. When Molly makes a suggestion for changes to the show in the monologue, Tom defensively objects, as he has been the head monologue writer, and his father got him and Hayes (his brother), jobs at the studio. Katherine is open to Molly's suggestions and orders her and the other men to come up with ideas. She also fires a late writer, McCary (Blake DeLong), which allows Molly room at the table. She is given her own office to share with Burditt.Predictably, the other men don't take too kindly to Molly working there, calling her a ""diversity hire"". She overhears this from Tom and hits back that she worked hard to get there while he was a case of nepotism.During another meeting, Molly makes suggestions to Katherine on how to appeal to a bigger audience. Katherine then asks to hear what solutions she has written for her problems, but Molly says she doesn't have any. Katherine berates her for appearing overconfident with nothing to show, causing Molly to walk out of the room and go cry under her desk. After some encouraging words from Burditt, she decides to keep going.In between work, Molly starts to get to know Charlie better. He is an aspiring stand-up comic, and she catches one of his shows. Afterwards, they make out, but Molly doesn't immediately want to sleep with him.Molly writes a joke for Katherine's monologue about an abortion bill being passed, which is significantly more politically charged than the usual jokes Katherine tells. Molly goes to the stage and stands next to Tom as she waits for Katherine to say it, but as the card for the joke comes up, Katherine passes it over for the next joke, which disappoints Molly. On the show, Katherine has a YouTube celebrity named Mimi Mismatch (Annaleigh Ashford) as a featured guest. Her claim to fame is a video of her sniffing her dog's butt and fainting. Katherine makes a snarky quip about Mimi's work, which leads to Mimi laying into Katherine by saying she's washed up and that she needs Mimi more than Mimi needs her. Although the staff tries to cut this out, the video of the incident goes viral by the next day.Brad hires a publicist named Robin (Megalyn Echikunwoke) to help make Katherine look better. During a party, a reporter asks Katherine about how she treats her writers, and Molly is asked about it when she is pointed out as being the new female writer. She lightens the mood with jokes and convinces the reporters that Katherine isn't a total monster.One night, Molly is ordered to work late, even though she was committed to a charity event. Katherine tells her that if she leaves, she can't come back. Molly accepts the terms and heads to the event. There, she performs stand-up for a bit, and Katherine arrives to watch. She likes what she sees from Molly and then goes up to perform herself, not having done stand-up in years. Her first joke is an attempt to appeal to the millennials, but it falls flat. She then becomes sincere about herself and tells everyone she is going to get replaced before making jokes about being a woman her age in Hollywood, which wins the audience over. Afterwards, it's clear that Molly is back in her good graces.Katherine starts to use Molly's jokes, and the abortion one kills during her monologue. Molly's influence becomes more noted among the other writers, and they even start trying to work with her individually. Katherine even starts adding segments to her show where she interacts with civilians in an attempt to get her name out to a younger demographic. However, she does feel a bit bad when Katherine says she basically WAS a diversity hire.During another show, Katherine has a young actress, Zoe Martlin (Halston Sage), as a guest. She stars in a schlock teen vampire show, but Katherine is nice to her and even praises Zoe's work. Zoe is elated and asks to hug Katherine, which she allows.Katherine and the writers attend a party where she meets ""frat boy"" comedian Daniel Tennant (Ike Barinholtz), whose comedy Katherine has seen and was repulsed by. She soon realizes that Daniel is the favorite to replace her, and after meeting with Caroline, it is confirmed. Caroline admits she doesn't find Katherine funny, but Katherine couldn't care less what she thinks. Despite her efforts, Brad later tells Katherine that they want her to officially announce Daniel as her replacement.After a meeting with the writers, and Molly stating how messed up it is that they are trying to take her show from her, Katherine goes on her show with Daniel as the guest. She tells the audience how Daniel is the pick to replace her, but she flat out states that she doesn't want to go. She even gets Daniel to say on TV that she should stay (just so he won't look bad), and so Katherine declares she is staying, to the delight of the audience but the frustration of Daniel and the producers. Molly later tries to celebrate with Charlie, until she sees that he already has someone over.Later on, Charlie's emails get hacked, and it is revealed that he had an affair with Katherine after Walter was diagnosed with Parkinsons. This causes more talks about getting Katherine replaced, to which she seems to not care for anymore. Molly tells Katherine she is acting stupid by not defending herself and her show, so Katherine fires her. Tom later goes to find Molly to cheer her up, now having eased up on her.Katherine later talks to Walter about the incident. Although he is dismayed at the fact that Katherine felt the need to cheat after the diagnosis, he doesn't want to throw away all the good times they had together over this one little slip-up.Katherine has one apparent last meeting with her writers (they have gigs lined up if the show is done), and even calls them all by their names (except for Hayes, he's still 6). She goes to do her show and come clean to the audience about her infidelity, but also notes that the show has been her whole life, and that it has been an honor to entertain her audiences. She signs off with her signature, ""I hope I've earned the privilege of your time."" Impressed, Caroline tells Katherine that she can keep her show, as long as she keeps it going as well as it has been lately.Katherine goes to find Molly, who has moved to Brooklyn with her mom and cousin. Knowing she is still upset with her, Katherine apologizes to Molly for how she treated her, admitting that she has hated herself and wanted others to feel the same. She tells Molly she wants her back and how she misses all the things that she did while working there, which leads Molly to realize that Katherine actually cares a lot about her (though she won't admit that). Molly then agrees to go back to work for Katherine.One year later, the show's staff has become more diverse and inclusive. The show is more popular than it has ever been, and Molly and Tom now work together as head monologue writers (and it's implied they are dating). Katherine then goes up to begin her show to an adoring crowd."

The Prodigy,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4504044/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A mother concerned about her young son's disturbing behavior thinks something supernatural may be affecting him. In her much-anticipated foray into the horror-thriller genre, Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Taylor Schilling stars in THE PRODIGY as Sarah, a mother whose young son Miles' disturbing behavior signals that an evil, possibly supernatural force has overtaken him. Fearing for her family's safety, Sarah must choose between her maternal instinct to love and protect Miles and a desperate need to investigate what or who is causing his dark turn. She is forced to look for answers in the past, taking the audience on a wild ride; one where the line between perception and reality becomes frighteningly blurry. More and more, John and Sarah's only child, Miles, is showing signs of genius-level intellect, and an emotional detachment. Alienated and incapable of socialising with kids his age, Sarah brings a now-eight-year-old Miles to the reincarnation expert, Dr Arthur Jacobson, who has a bizarre theory about the origin of the exceptional boy's problems. However, is there a logical explanation for Mile's violent attitude and his increasingly hostile behaviour? Under those dire circumstances, if the doctor is right, can Sarah and John help their son before it's too late?—Nick Riganas In Ohio, police officers kill the serial-killer Edward Scarka, when one of his victims flees from him and discloses his hideout in a farmhouse. Fifteen minutes later in Pennsylvania, Sarah Blume delivers her son Miles Blume. Soon Miles becomes the pride and joy of Sarah and her husband John Blume with his intelligence. When Miles is eight years old, his parents note his aggressive behavior and Sarah records his words during a nightmare. She brings Miles to the psychiatrist Dr. Elaine Strasser that shows the tape to Dr. Arthur Jacobson, who is specialist in reincarnation. Soon he concludes that Miles is possessed by an evil entity and may lose his soul. What will Sarah and John do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The film opens in Ohio where a young woman named Margaret St. James (Brittany Allen) escapes from a home where she was held captive. She runs toward the road and gets a woman to stop and help her, and she sees that Margaret's right hand has been severed.Meanwhile in Pennsylvania, a couple named John (Peter Mooney) and Sarah Bloom (Taylor Schilling) are heading to the hospital for the arrival of their baby. As Sarah goes into labor, police in Ohio arrive outside the home of Edward Scarka (Paul Fauteux), the man who captured Margaret. He walks outside nude to surrender with something behind his back as the officers have their guns drawn on him. Scarka raises his hand and is gunned down. They see that he is holding Margaret's hand. Moments after Scarka dies, the Blooms' son Miles is born with blood in the same places where Scarka was shot.Over time, Miles turns out to be an oddly calm child. He doesn't cry when getting shots (or just doesn't cry ever), but also demonstrates unsettling behavior, like grabbing a spider just to crush it, and then speaking Hungarian in his sleep. Sarah also notes to her friend that Miles has heterochromia (two different eye colors).Miles grows to be eight years old (now played by Jackson Robert Scott). John and Sarah go out on a date and leave him with a babysitter named Zoe (Elisa Moolecherry). After watching TV, Zoe offers to play Hide and Seek with Miles before putting him to bed. As he goes to hide, he loosens a light bulb to the basement. Zoe walks downstairs to find him while barefoot, ending with her stepping on a broken glass cup and getting a large shard stuck in there. When Sarah talks to Miles about it, he claims to not remember even playing the game, let alone how Zoe ended up at the bottom of the stairs with a bloody foot.As Miles sleeps later that night, Sarah goes into his room and hears him whisper ""Go fuck yourself."" He starts to speak Hungarian again before waking up startled. Sarah suggests he had a bad dream, but he says he was having a good dream.Another incident occurs at school when Miles wants to work on a project with a girl, but she is already working with another boy. Miles goes to the janitor's closet and grabs a wrench before bringing it back to class to beat the boy. Miles is later taken to see a psychologist named Dr. Elaine Strasser (Paula Boudreau). She later meets with Sarah and a colleague named Arthur Jacobsen (Colm Feore). They reviewed a tape that Sarah recorded of Miles speaking Hungarian, and Arthur says that it's a rare dialect that only a small portion of people in Hungary speak. It translates to something threatening and insulting toward a woman. Arthur mentions a time he went to India and spoke to a six-year-old boy named Padman who claimed to have remembered a past life of his, including his siblings, his mother's favorite song, and the moment in which he died by drowning. He suggests that Miles has a separate personality in his head and that they need to get Miles to be his normal self before the dark personality becomes dominant. Sarah dismisses what the two say as ridiculous, but they give her a video to watch on a similar case.The family's dog Tallulah disappears. John takes Miles to go looking for her on the streets, and Miles starts making disturbing comments alluding to Tallulah being dead, as well as the abuse John suffered at the hands of his father. John confronts Sarah about this since he thought she said something to Miles, but they discover that the boy had placed a camera behind a picture of them to spy on them. After Miles later suggests that John had been abusing him, John angrily steps out of the house and stays elsewhere for a while.Sarah wakes up at night and finds Miles at the end of the hallway crying for her. She calls for him to run to her, but as he runs through the darkness, he briefly morphs into Scarka and grabs Sarah. This is just a nightmare that she wakes up from. Miles then comes into her room and asks to sleep next to her for the night. Miles lays beside her and reaches for her hand. He asks Sarah if he will always love him no matter what he does, and Sarah hesitantly replies yes. Soon, Sarah notices flies buzzing around the room, and throughout most of the house. She goes to the basement and smells something awful. On the floor is blood and a rotted severed paw. Sarah sees something at the bottom propped up with a wooden board and knows that Tallulah is in there. She tries to pry the board back until Miles brings her a hammer to to do. Sarah pulls it off and Tallulah's body spills out, her throat having been cut. After John returns to find out about this, they decide they have to do whatever it takes to make Miles normal.Sarah brings Miles to visit Arthur. He meets with Miles privately to hypnotize him and bring out the good Miles personality before the Scarka personality takes over. Miles appears possessed and starts scratching into the couch before Scarka starts to speak for Miles, and he threatens Arthur with making it look like he had been drugged and molested if Arthur tries to fix Miles. He orders Arthur to tell Sarah that the process didn't work. After they leave, Arthur notices that Miles managed to scratch Scarka's name into the couch. Arthur calls Sarah late at night to get her to look up Scarka's name on the computer where Miles can't see her. She learns that Scarka was a serial killer who murdered multiple women and always severed and kept one of their hands as a trophy. Scarka also had heterochromia and died 15 minutes before Miles was born. Arthur figures that Scarka may have come back because he feels he has unfinished business.Sarah goes into Miles's room and discovers that he (or Scarka) has been keeping newspaper clippings and articles on Margaret, who went on to write a memoir about her ordeal with Scarka. Sarah realizes that Scarka's soul still lingers because his unfinished business is Margaret.John and Sarah prepare to take Miles to a hospital to help him. As John drives him away from home, he starts tearfully telling Miles that he loves him. The boy responds by cutting John's seat belt with scissors and then stabbing him in the side, causing John to crash into a tree. Sarah finds them at the hospital and is told by the doctor that John must be kept in a coma for a few weeks as the swelling in his brain goes down.Sarah decides it is time to end things once and for all. She takes Miles and gives him sleeping pills so he won't see her go into a store to purchase a gun. She drives to Margaret's house and pretends to be a victim that was inspired by her book so that Margaret will allow her inside. After talking, Sarah goes to the bathroom and vomits as she is not prepared to kill an innocent woman. She loads her gun and draws it on Sarah, but she ultimately can't pull the trigger. Margaret then sees Miles has broken in and is holding a knife. He says the same line to her that Scarka did when she met him, regarding his different color eyes. Miles stabs Margaret and gets her on the floor, stabbing her again in the stomach and then slashing it before he snarls to her that she never should have run away from him. Sarah tries to help Margaret, but it is useless. She runs after Miles as he walks through a field. Sarah yells at Scarka and asks why he is still there if his business is complete. He tells her that the boy that was Miles was gone the moment Sarah said she would love him no matter what he did, and now Scarka is in full control of the body. Sarah takes her gun out to shoot him, but she is shot down by a neighbor. Scarka feigns the innocent boy persona and runs to the man for comfort as Sarah slowly dies.Sometime later, Scarka, still fooling others as Miles, is taken in by a foster family. The mother invites him inside, and he focuses on her hands. As the boy walks up to his room, he looks in the mirror to see Scarka's reflection staring back at him."

The Peanut Butter Falcon is an adventure story set in the world of a modern Mark Twain that begins when Zak (22), a young man with Down syndrome, runs away from the nursing home where he lives to chase his dream of becoming a professional wrestler by attending the wrestling school The Salt Water Redneck. Through circumstances beyond their control Tyler (32), a small-time outlaw on the run, becomes Zak's unlikely coach and ally. Together they wind through deltas, elude capture, drink whisky, find God, catch fish, and convince Eleanor (28), a kind nursing home employee with a story of her own, to join them on their journey.—Lucky Treehouse Without a biological family anymore, young adult Zak, with Down Syndrome, is housed against his own wishes in the only facility in the state open to him, the Britthayven Retirement Home in Richmond, Virginia, where his primary caregiver is a young, caring woman named Eleanor. On his third attempt with help from some of the elderly but nonetheless wily residents, Zak, who continually watches an old VHS tape of his favorite professional wrestler Salt Water Redneck, is able to escape from the home in his pursuit of traveling to Ayden, North Carolina to attend Salt Water's wrestling school he's seen advertised on that tape, his goal to become a pro wrestler. This dream is stronger with the many taunts over the course of his life that he would never achieve anything for being ""retarded"". Along the way, he encounters a young man named Tyler, who too is running away. Since the death of his older brother Mark, Tyler, who works for a boat shop in one of the river estuaries of the area, has lost his way, and has resorted to poaching blue crab traps to earn extra pocket money. In the process, he purposefully burns bridges with many working in the fishing or boating business in the area as he tries to get away to start life anew in Jupiter, Florida. Initially not wanting to have anything to do with Zak in dealing with his own flight, Tyler has a change of heart in finding that Zak is a fellow ""outlaw"", Tyler who vows to help Zak get to Ayden on his own way to Jupiter. The bond that forms between the two may give the other a different perspective on life, and may be broken by circumstances, including if their pursuers find them, Zak's being Eleanor, and Tyler's being two other fishers, Duncan and Ratboy, who will resort to violence to get their vigilante justice on Tyler if need be.—Huggo Zak, a 22-year-old man with Down Syndrome, escapes from a state-run care facility with the help of his elderly roommate, to train as a professional wrestler under the tutelage of his hero, the Saltwater Redneck.

They eventually build a boat and begin traveling by water. Eleanor soon finds them, but after learning her boss intends to send Zak to a more severe form of confinement, joins them to travel south.One night, two men pursuing Tyler catch up with the trio, and Zak defends them with the gun. When they reach North Carolina, Tyler learns Clint (the Saltwater Redneck) has retired and closed the school, but convinces him to resurrect his alter ego for Zak. Saltwater trains Zak as a wrestler, and quickly puts Zak on a local fight card, which he believes he has rigged for Zak's safety and success. However, when the fight happens, Zak's opponent does not hold back, and proceeds to beat him. As Tyler attempts to intervene, the two men arrive, and one man hits Tyler on the head, knocking him unconscious. Zak, in a feat of extraordinary strength, manages to lift his opponent overhead, and throw him forcefully out of the ring, something Saltwater had told him was impossible.

Carol, Noah, and Tessa make their way through the crowded dorm halls looking for her new room, B-22. They open the door and are met by loud music and two girls sitting on the bed. Tessa introduces herself to her new roommate Steph (Khadijha Red Thunder) who is vaping. Steph introduces Tessa to Tristan (Pia Mia). Steph makes a remark about being unsure about having a freshman roommate, but she says it should be cool... she'll be her spirit guide. Tristan says that they can get Tessa into all the best places even without a fake ID. Carol leaves the room upset and demands that they ask for a room change since the room reeked of weed.

She is shown later in bed texting with Noah about starting her 1st day the next morning.Tessa leaves her dorm early in the morning, and head's to her 1st class across campus. She meets Landon (Shane Paul McGhie) outside of a locked classroom. They are the first students to arrive. A professor comes by shortly and opens the door for them. It is an Econ 101 course. They chit chat about their majors and being first year students.Later that day Tessa takes a shower in the dorm and realizes that her clothes fell on the ground and are all wet. She returns to her room in her towel and opens the closet door. She notices a boy sitting on Steph's bed in the closet mirror and whips around startled. She tells him she thinks he is in the wrong room. The boy tells her he is in fact in the right place as he barely breaks his concentration from the book he is reading. She then asks him how he got in, and he holds up a set of keys. She asks him to leave so that she can get dressed, but he tells her not to flatter herself... he's not even looking at her. Steph enters the room and sits down on the bed with him. Tessa asks Steph to have her BF leave the room, to which Steph replies that he is not her BF and asks the boy what he had been saying to her to make her think that. The boy says he's been minding his business. Steph tells Tessa she is going out with them that night, but Tessa seems reluctant. The boy makes a snide comment about not being able to see her as the partying type. Tessa decides not to go. Steph and the boy get up to leave. Just as the boy is about to go out the door, he hands the book he was reading back to Tessa. He says that The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book, and he hates to spoil it for her, but it was all a dream. Tessa corrects him and says that actually, it was all a lie (important later). The boy smirks at her and leaves the room.Tessa is shown the next day at a campus coffee shop studying. A trio of people walk in (one of them being the rude boy from her room the night before). They order their drinks and Tessa makes eye contact with the boy, and he slightly smiles. They briefly stare at each other, and he turns and walks out with his friends. Tessa goes to the library to study. She is interrupted by Steph who tells her that they are going to a party that night. Steph helps Tessa pick out her party outfit. She settles on a maroon dress.They make their way into the frat party, and Steph meets up with Tristan in the kitchen, kissing her (she is her GF). This seems to shock Tessa slightly.

There is Zed (Samuel Larsen), Jace the Townie (Swen Temmel), Molly (Inanna Sarkis), and the rude boy Hardin (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin). Molly and Hardin are laying with each other on the couch and touching & kissing each other.Zed inquires about Tessa's major - she wants to do something business or economics related. Jace offers Tessa a drink, which she initially refuses, but takes a swig after Molly makes fun of her. Molly suggests that they play a game of Truth or Dare. Tessa says that's a kids game, but Molly explains not the way that they play. Jace asks Tessa truth or dare, to which she chooses truth. Molly asks her where the craziest place she ever had sex was. Tessa is noticeably uncomfortable and asks to pass, and Molly picks up on it. She asks Tessa if she is a virgin. Tessa does not want to answer, so she asks for a dare. Jace dares Tessa to make out with Hardin. Hardin slowly gets up from the couch and walks over to her.Molly starts filming the encounter on her phone. He bends down and whispers, asking her she wanted to go through with it. They both stand up and after a few seconds of them looking into each other eyes...Tessa announces she's done playing the game and walks off. Hardin seems shocked by this, and the group teases Hardin about this being his first rejection. He turns to Molly (who is still filming) with a little look of disbelief on his face, but he slowly smiles. Tessa calls Noah outside on the porch of the party where he gets onto her about partying and drinking. She hangs up on him and heads back inside. She makes her way up the staircase and into one of the bedrooms. There is a Union Jack flag hanging on the wall and a shelf full of books. She sees a copy of Wuthering Heights with sticky notes throughout it. She opens it to one of the pages.Just as she begins to read, she is started by Hardin who asks her what she is doing. She asks him if he is drunk, which he says he doesn't drink... just like her. He sees that she has his copy of Wuthering Heights and recites some lines from it. He calls her Theresa and asks her if she knows it's Bronte. She corrects him and says her name is Tessa. Hardin then asks what she is doing in his room. She seems embarrassed that she is there. He grabs hold of the book, runs it up her inner thigh using it to lift up her dress slightly and leans into her. He asks if they are still playing b/c she owes him a dare.

She is shown laying in bed texting with Noah again and him apologizing for scolding her earlier... he wants what is best for her.Tessa makes her way into a class and looks for a spot to sit. She sees Molly and Zed in the crowd and avoids them. She finds Landon in the front and joins him. They are both excited to have been allowed to take this upper-level English Course. Hardin makes his way into the classroom and sits just as Professor Soto begins talking about the book 'Pride & Prejudice'. She asks Hardin what his thoughts on the book are. Tessa seems perturbed that he is in her class. Hardin says that Elizabeth Bennett gave Mr. Darcy a hard time and he wasn't so bad. He believes that love is something that you can turn on and off, that it isn't real. Tessa raises her hand and says that she felt the novel was ahead of its time. Hardin interjects and says that's a load of crap. The banter back and forth in front of the classroom full of students. The disagreement has morphed into being about them and what happened between them the night before. Professor Soto ends the argument and Hardin looks pleased with himself, yet intrigued by Tessa's tenacity. Class dismisses, and Hardin follows Tessa out of the building exclaiming how much fun that was. Tessa scolds him and says that there is nothing between them. Hardin feigns ignorance and says he was only talking about the book disagreement they just had. Hardin walks off, and Landon joins her. Tessa voices her disapproval of how arrogant Hardin is. Landon says that Hardin is just being Hardin and he knows him well. Landon's mother is dating the University Chancellor... Chancellor Scott (who happens to be Hardin's dad). He says that they tolerate each other.We then see Tessa sitting at a tattoo shop while Jace inks Steph. They suggest that she gets one, but she refuses, saying her mother would kill her. She explains that her mother has her whole life planned out for and that she probably has already planned her wedding to Noah. Steph questions whether Noah is the only boy that Tessa has been with...which he is. Tessa is later shown laying in her bed as Steph and Tristan come home and start to fool around. Tessa turns over in her bed and seems lonely.The next day, Tessa walks into the campus coffee shop and orders a drink. She notices Hardin sitting on the couch reading. Hardin approaches her as she is putting sugar in her coffee. Hardin tells her it will be difficult to stay away from each other since Steph is his friend and her roommate. He says that they should start over...just be friends. Hardin says that he wants to show her something, a place. Tessa maintains that they need to keep their distance. Hardin responds by taking a step back from her making Tessa laugh. Hardin tells her he'll see her around and walks away disappointed. As Tessa heads for the door, she has a change of heart and decides to join him. They how them driving in his muscle car in silence stealing glances at one another. They come to a wooded area and proceed to walk to clearing with a lake. Hardin announces that this is his favorite place. He starts to take his shirt off and says that they are going swimming. Tessa seems uneasy b/c she does not have a suit. He jumps in and comments how nice the water feels. He tells her she can wear his shirt if she wants. She asks for privacy while she takes off her dress. Hardin faces away from her, sneaking a peak. He turns back around and comments that he likes his shirt better on her. He helps lower Tessa into the water, and they swim playfully. He says he enjoys the silence and they talk about he asks questions about her BF. She asks him whom he loves most in the world, and he says himself. They move closer to one another, and Tessa reminds him that they are just going to be friends. Hardin says he doesn't think they can only be friends. They kiss each other. They get out of the lake, and he hands her back her dress and turns around so she can put it on. They are standing back to back on the dock. Just as she is about to re-dress she slowly reaches her hand back to touch his. He turns around and starts running his hands up and down her arm & chest while breathing into her ear. He lifts her shirt up to rub her stomach and puts his fingers in her panty waistline. He can tell she is nervous. He asks if she's ever been touched before, she nods. He abruptly stops, and she turns around slightly annoyed asking him why he quit. He says that they've got time.They next show Hardin and Tessa at a bar/grill. They receive their food and talk about Hardin not believing in love. She starts asking about his family, and he starts getting slightly defensive and upset. Tessa backs off. Just then Molly and Zed interrupt their conversation, and Hardin looks uneasy. Hardin tells them they were just leaving and Molly flirts with him and asks for a ride. Hardin refuses and says that Zed can take her home. Molly is touching Hardin and clearly trying to get a rise out of Tessa. Hardin hands his car keys to her and tells her to wait outside. She gets up confused and says she will be standing by the bar. Hardin, Molly, and Zed stay at the table to talk. A few mins pass and Hardin joins Tessa at the bar. Tessa asks him if he was embarrassed to be seen with her. He says that's not the case. Tessa then says that she plans on telling Noah about the two of them. Hardin scoffs at her and tells her nothing is going on and that if she wants to break up with Noah, she should do it for herself...not him, because he doesn't date. Tessa is shocked and angry and slams his keys on the bar top and storms out. Hardin curses to himself knowing that he messed up.Tessa is shown going through her closet and putting on make-up. She seems like she can't find a look that she likes. She is then shown waking up with Hardin staring down at her, caressing her face and asking what she is dreaming about... she wakes up and realizes that was a dream.Noah comes for a surprise visit Tessa, and they go to a bonfire. Everyone meets Noah, and they sit down. Hardin is drinking, brooding and upset at seeing Noah and Tessa together. Molly suggests they play ""suck and blow."" They each pass a playing card to each other mouth by mouth until Jace purposefully drops his right as Tessa leans in. Jace continues to make a pass at her, while Noah tells him to back off sheepishly. Hardin jumps off the log across the fire and punches Jace, and they begin to fight. They have pulled apart and Hardin storms off into the dark. Tessa and Noah are then laying together in her room watching TV.Noah falls asleep, and Tessa receives a text from Landon asking for her help. Tessa arrives at Landon's house and sees the kitchen in disarray, glasses broken. She asks what happened. Landon says that Hardin came over in rage, drunk and started smashing things. He mentioned Tessa's name amid his tirade, and that's why Landon texted her to come over thinking she could calm him down. Tessa heads out back to the pool area where Hardin is sitting taking shots of liquor. Hardin seems surprised to see her. She tells him she thought he didn't drink. He says he doesn't or didn't. He says the mess he made inside was his celebration for his dad announcement that he is getting married to Landon's mom while his mom lives in poor conditions in London. He offers her a drink, but she refuses to say that he probably has had enough. He drops the bottle, and it shatters. Tess bends down to pick up the glass shard against Hardin's wishes, and she cuts her hand. He takes her upstairs to clean up her wound. Hardin seemingly tipsy apologizes for the way he treated her, he says that he thinks he has changed his mind about dating and tells her he is a mess.Tessa says that they are both a mess and they begin to fool around. He tells her that she never has to cover up...not for him. They fall asleep next to each other. Tessa wakes in the early morning and realizes her mistake. She rushes back to her dorm where she sees Noah outside on his phone trying to reach her. He knows that something is going on, but his suspicions are confirmed when he sees Hardin walking up to them arguing. Tessa tries to explain herself, but Noah is too upset and leaves. She tells Hardin to go home and goes back up to her dorm.

They sit on the roof outside of his window and talk about her father leaving when she was little. She also talks about how bad she feels for what she did to Noah. She says that Noah is her best friend, but Hardin is so much more. We next see Tessa in the library just as it is closing. Hardin sneaks up behind her, and they hide from the security guard. Hardin reads to Tessa in the darkened, locked library. They hear the guard circling back and make a run for it and narrowly escaping trouble. They lay on the ground and hold hands, Hardin comes up behind her in a darkened astronomy class and tells her how beautiful she is. They sit in her bed and start to fool around.Carol comes bursting through the door and becomes upset about what she has just seen. Tessa follows her mom down the hall, and they argue.

She threatens to cut her off she continues the relationship, which Tessa refuses to end. Her mom cuts her off, and she leaves warning her daughter that Hardin will beak her heart.Landon and Tessa discuss her getting cut off by her mother because of Hardin. He warns that Hardin is complicated, but Tessa says that he is different around her. Tessa is seen getting picked up outside of the coffee shop by Hardin.

He has agreed to water a friend of his father's plants while she is out of the country for a year. He mentions that they should live there together since she has been cut off. He took this plant sitting gig for Tessa. They move in, and there are scenes of them hanging together falling more in love. They go to an aquarium where Hardin is taking pictures of Tessa and the fish. He says that he can't believe that she is his.

Hardin asks her if she wants him to stop, but she tells him to proceed. The next day they are sitting in the bath and Hardin is drawing words on her back for her to guess. He finger traces ""I LOVE U,"" but she does not figure it out. He doesn't tell her what it says.Molly confronts Tessa in the bathroom after class and asks her about her BF. Tessa tells her that they broke up. Molly says that it looks like she moves on quickly and that Hardin said to her that they had been spending time together. Tessa confirms that they had been spending time together and Molly said she's glad, much to Tessa's surprise. Molly says that Hardin does what Hardin does.Tessa is reading a book in their apartment when Hardin's phone keeps getting texts. Tessa picks up his phone and sees that they are from Molly. Molly tells Hardin to meet them at a bar at 9:00pm, asks if he said Tessa yet, and then says maybe she will tell Tessa. Hardin walks in the room, and Tessa confronts him about the texts. Hardin says he has no idea what Molly is talking about and then says he is leaving. Tessa gets upset that he is leaving in the middle of their argument, but Hardin asks if she trusts him and she does. Tessa is sitting at home later that night, and Hardin won't return her texts. She gets a text from Jace telling her to meet him at another bar, and he will tell her where Hardin is. She arrives and sees Hardin's card. She gets into it, but it is Jace inside. She demands to know where Jace is. He tells her maybe he is at Bob's. She walks in and sees Molly, Zed, Steph eating at a table. She approaches them, and Steph says she hasn't seen her since she moved out. Tessa tells that group that she has been living with Hardin off campus and Molly gives her a look. They all look confused about how serious their relationship is. Jace walks in with Hardin who looks mortified and scared that Tessa is there.Jace fist bumps Molly and says he's got her back. Molly starts telling Hardin how Tessa has been giving them all the details about their relationship and how adorable they are. She asks Hardin if there's anything he wants to tell Tessa. Tessa interjects and asks him if anything is going on between him and Molly. Hardin denies this. Tessa doesn't believe him, and she says that she saw the texts. Hardin says they meant nothing to him, and he didn't even reply back. Molly asks Hardin if he thinks this thing has gone a little too far. She explains that something is going on, but it's not what she thinks (referring to Tessa believing that he and Molly have been cheating with each other). Hardin tells Molly to shut up and asks Tessa to leave with him so he can explain. Molly asks Tessa if she remembers Truth or Dare. Hardin and Zed try to stop Molly, but she pulls out her phone showing Tessa a video of the night that she rejected Hardin.

Hardin starts to cry, while Molly tells her it was all a game.Hardin says that this was recorded before everything before he got to know her. Tessa looks around the table at everyone asking if it is true. They all avoid eye contact. Tessa gets up from the table and storms out with Hardin following behind her. They argue in the rain, and she calls him a liar. He tells her that all of this was before and she cuts him off saying it was before he snapped his fingers and turned it off. Hardin brings up the fact that she told him that nothing could change how she felt about him to which Tessa says they are both liars. She runs off into the night while Hardin cries in the rain.Tessa gets on a bus and goes back home, she makes up with her mom and goes to apologize to Noah.

She applies for an internship she learned about fro Chancellor Scott and is invited for an interview.On the last day of class, Professor Soto is dismissing everyone. She asks for Tessa to stay behind and gives her Hardin's final project saying that it was meant more for her. She debates with Landon whether or not she should open it. When she finally does, she sees pictures of her and the lake. She reads his essay about love and decides to go to the lake where they shared their first kiss. In a voice-over, Hardin is talking about how he has found his Elizabeth Bennett and how their souls are one and the same. He asks for forgiveness. He appears behind her and sits down next to her on the dock. The voice-over continues with Hardin saying that she had once asked him whom he loved the most in this world, and he says ""it's you"". They look at each other."
The Kitchen,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5822564/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The wives of New York gangsters in Hell's Kitchen in the 1970s continue to operate their husbands' rackets after they're locked up in prison. In Hell's Kitchen, circa 1978, three women are married to members of the Irish mob: Kathy Brennan and her husband, Jimmy, have two kids. Jimmy is kind and wants to leave the mob. Ruby O'Carroll is married to Kevin, who's the son of Helen and heir to the mob empire. Claire Walsh is married to Rob, who is abusive towards her. One night while robbing a convenience store, FBI Agents Silvers and Martinez, who have been trailing them, bust them, and the three men are sentenced to three years in prison.While Kevin is in prison, Little Jackie becomes the head of the mob. He tells the three wives that he will ensure their financial comfort, but, gives them each a tiny pittance. Kathy can barely afford to feed her kids. Claire, who volunteers at a homeless shelter, is attacked by one of the homeless men. The women ask Jackie for more money, but, he viciously denies them. Kathy tries to find a job, but, no one will hire her because she's a mother. The women are at a loss for what to do next. Shortly thereafter, they are told that, despite all the local businesses paying protection fees to the mob, they have seen very little results under Little Jackie. The women seize the opening, using Kathy's cousin Duffy and friend Burns as their enforcers. They begin collecting protection fees and helping out the neighborhood, making a huge profit and becoming beloved in the community.When Little Jackie finds out, he has his enforcers severely beat Duffy and Burns, who try to end their association with the women. They confront Little Jackie and declare that they are in charge now. Little Jackie assures them they'll be dead by morning. The women sleep with guns under their beds, but, nothing happens. The next morning, while Claire is taking out the trash, Jackie assaults her in the alley and begins to attempt to rape her, but, he is shot in the head by Gabriel O'Malley, a former Irish mob enforcer and war vet who had been in hiding until Ruby called him. He has always loved Claire. Gabriel shows the ladies how to dispose of a body and, with Jackie out of the way, the women begin running the neighborhood, with Gabriel as their chief enforcer. Gabriel and Claire begin a relationship, and Gabriel teaches Claire how to kill. She tracks down the homeless man who attacked her and shoots him in the head.When local workers complain that they are not getting the construction contracts on buildings being built nearby, the women promise to correct their situation. They meet with the rabbi who is in charge of the property, but, he refuses to hire union workers. The women offer him protection. He explains that he already pays protection to the Brooklyn Italian mafia. The women arrange for him to be intimidated until relents. The women are ordered to meet with Alfonso Coretti, the head of the Italian mafia, who is furious that they have taken business from him. But he recognizes that they have power, and cuts a deal with them: some of his Italian men work on the site too, and the ladies kick back some of their profits - the women refuse at first, but Coretti tells them that he has made arrangements for the women's husbands to be released early. He knows when the husbands return, the women's place in power will be threatened, and he will support and protect the women. Realizing he's right, the women agree. In exchange, Ruby demands more area of the city be under the women's control, and Coretti agrees.Before the husbands are set to be released, the women do everything they can to shore up their power. Ruby takes Helen out to dinner, and as Helen berates and insults her, Ruby shoves her downstairs, killing her. When the husbands get out, there is tension and struggling for power. Kevin thinks he's in charge now and wants to cut the women out, Jimmy is concerned and wants Kathy to quit, and Rob is furious to find that Claire has left him and is living with Gabriel. He comes to her new place and hits her, twice, and she shoots him and disposes of his body. Kathy is horrified, and the three women are summoned by Coretti, who tells them that he has heard that a hit has been placed on them by members of their own gang. Kathy doesn't want to believe it, but Ruby offers them more money and asks the mafia to kill Kevin, Duffy, Burns, Jimmy, and a young member named Colin. Kathy is horrified, telling them Jimmy had nothing to do with it and that Colin is just a kid and to spare him. The deal is made. Kevin, Burns, and Duffy are all executed. Colin breaks into Claire and Gabriel's apartment. Claire is shot and killed by Colin, who Gabriel kills in anger afterward.After Claire's funeral, things are tense between Ruby and Kathy. Ruby and Gabriel feel it's Kathy's fault Claire is dead. Kathy feels guilty and sad, but is trying to figure out how to keep running the business with Ruby. Jimmy angrily keeps telling her he wants her to quit. While confronting Ruby, Kathy realizes that Ruby has been taking some of their collection money and paying off Agent Silvers to keep them out of trouble. Ruby explains that she keeps them out of trouble, and in fact, set up their husbands to be caught on the night they were originally arrested. She knew that with the husbands gone, there would be an opening for her to move up in the world, and take power as a black woman. This was the only way. She even had Silvers murder Gonzalez to protect them, and she's been gaining more and more territory. When Kathy goes to pick up her kids, she finds they aren't there - panicked she begins searching for them, but gets a call from Coretti - the kids are with him. She goes to the meeting and finds that her kids are safe, and that Jimmy brought them there - he met with Coretti to ask for a deal to cut Kathy out. Kathy is horrified that he would put their kids lives in danger for his ego - she leaves him there, and Jimmy is executed by the mafia.At Jimmy's funeral, Kathy's father, who has constantly been telling her how disappointed he is in her for getting into the mob, tells her he's proud of her for protecting her kids. Kathy says she did it for herself. Ruby tells Kathy that a vendor hasn't been making their payments, and asks her to meet her there. Kathy goes, and finds that Ruby is waiting with Gabriel to kill Kathy - but Kathy has brought all of the local Irishmen to back her up. She tells Gabriel she loved Claire too, and Gabriel admits he only got back into this life because of Claire and leaves. Kathy tells Ruby that she needs Ruby to keep running the uptown area they've gotten, and Ruby needs her to keep running the Irish in The Kitchen. The two women reach an understanding, and continue on, the most powerful women in New York."
Blinded by the Light,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8266310/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In England in 1987, a teenager from an Asian family learns to live his life, understand his family and find his own voice through the music of American rock starBruce Springsteen. In 1987 Britain, Javed Khan is a British-Pakistani college arts student in Luton in a family with a domineering father. Depressed by his oppressive family life and feeling he has no future in a hostile community, a newfound friend introduces Javed to the music of Bruce Springsteen. Touched by the rock star's powerfully eloquent affinity of his own feelings, Javed is inspired to reach out for his own dreams with his own talents. However, although Javed finds friends he never expected in this personal quest, he also finds himself butting heads with his newly unemployed father who stubbornly refuses to understand his son's new aspirations. In this conflict of values in a troubled time, Javed must decide what is truly important to him while his family struggles to understand what has changed and what remains with a new generation feeling born to run.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) 1987. Sixteen year old Pakistani-British Javed Khan, who has just started sixth form college as what he sees as his only ""way out"", hates most everything about his life in Luton to where his parents long ago emigrated from Pakistan for a better life, the hills above the highway where he and his longtime best friend, Caucasian Matt, have spent much time in it representing life away from town. He hates how Thatcherism has decimated the livelihood of the working class, to which his family belongs. He hates how his traditional father regulates everything in his life, including which classes he takes, how he spends his social time, that he is to hand over any money he earns for the family as a collective - more so now for his oldest ""sister"" (really his cousin) Yasmeen's upcoming lavish wedding - that he will arrange for a wife for him when the time comes, and that everything is in the goal of him working in a white collar ""suit wearing"" profession in Luton when he reaches adulthood. He hates the overt racism - some of it anti-immigrant in general, but much of it anti-Muslim or anti-Pakistani directed - in town, not all of it hurled solely from skinheads. He hates how his father and his other Pakistani friends and relatives turn their heads to that racism to maintain a sense of decorum in not wanting to rock the boat. And he hates that his father increases even more pressure on the family as a whole to pick up the slack when he, after sixteen years, is laid off from his automotive factory assembly line job. Javed's one sanctuary is writing poetry - ""crap"" in his own estimation - about how he feels about his life in general. Javed's life takes slight turns when his English teacher Miss Clay - English which his father doesn't even know is one of his courses - encourages him to continue writing as being ""his"" outlet to express himself, crap or not, and when one of his few other South Asian classmates, Roops, introduces him to the music ofBruce Springsteen, considered largely by his peers the music of their parents. Javed feels Springsteen is talking directly to him in in the lyrics relating to his own life. While Matt always vows to find him a girlfriend, Javed, in his increasing confidence through Springsteen, gets up the nerve to approach classmate Eliza, a political activist who he has longed for from afar upon first sight. The question then becomes if Javed, who is beginning to find his own voice in that connection to Springsteen, can reconcile this newfound ""freedom"" against the other aspects of his life, especially the control wielded by his father.—Huggo Javed (Kalra) is a Pakistani teenager who experiences racial and economic turmoil while living in Luton in 1987. He writes poetry as a means to escape the intolerance of his hometown and the stubborn views of his traditional father. When a classmate introduces him to the music of Bruce Springsteeen, Javed sees parallels between the singer's powerful lyrics and his own working-class environment. n 1980, young Javed Khan (Ronak Singh Chadha Berges) is with his best friend Matt (Billy Barratt), who just got a new bike. Javed writes in his journal about how the Russians have been occupying Pakistan, which forced his family to relocate to Britain. He and Matt have dreams of going to London together when they are older. The boys then ride the bike together.Seven years later, Javed (now played by Viviek Chadra) lives in Luton with his parents Malik (Kuvinder Ghir) and Noor (Meera Ganatra), and sisters Yasmeen (Tara Divina) and Shazia (Nikita Mehta). Javed has an interest in contemporary rock music, which Malik does not approve of. He rides his bike to see Matt (now played by Dean-Charles Chapman), who is returning from a trip to Ibiza with his girlfriend Emma (Kit Reeve). After giving him a gift, Malik comes nearby and reacts with disgust at Matt and Emma making out. Javed goes back home to receive birthday gifts from his family. He secretly wishes to escape his town, as well as to make a lot of money and to kiss a girl.Javed writes lyrics for Matt's band, as well as his own poems on the side. Matt critiques Javed's work for being depressing. Javed expresses his desire to go to Manchester University so that he can definitely leave Luton.Javed begins his first day at a new school. Malik embarrasses him in front of the other students by loudly ordering him to stay away from girls, as well as to find a Jewish friend to be successful. Javed feels out of place, as he is one of only two Pakistani students attending the school. He bumps into the other student, Roops (Aaron Phagura), who says he is listening to ""The Boss"". Javed then goes to Ms. Clay's (Hayley Atwell) class where he develops a crush on an activist student named Eliza (Nell Williams). Ms. Clay wants to teach her students how to develop their writing skills, which is something that Javed takes interest in. He talks to her after class about what he has written.During lunch, Javed sits alone since he doesn't know anyone. Roops approaches him and gives him two Bruce Springsteen cassettes, as he calls Bruce ""the key to all that is true in this shitty world.""On his way back home from school, Javed passes a racist punk spray-painting ""Pakis Out"" on a wall before he spits on Javed. He then starts to follow Javed until he runs up to Matt's apartment door to be greeted by him and Emma. They invite him to a party to go to later, but when Javed brings it up at dinner, his father forbids him from going. Later, the family gathers with other Pakistani friends, but a group of young boys outside mock the family by peeing through their mail slot and calling them ""Pakis"".Javed wants to write for the school paper, but he is rejected since the head of the paper doesn't care to read his work. When he gets home later, the family watches the news about General Motors laying off a large number of employees, including Malik. He comes home in frustration. This, along with the constant racist berating and Malik's inability to understand his son, takes a toll on Javed's nerves, and he tells Shazia that they were born in the wrong time, place, and family. He even throws his poems out because he feels like giving up. When he goes back to his room, the Springsteen tapes fall out of his backpack. He decides to give them a listen, and he hears ""Dancing in the Dark"" for the first time. The lyrics immediately grab him, like something inside him has been awakened. He then listens to ""The Promised Land"" as he goes outside to recover his poems, and after hearing more of Bruce's songs, Javed feels as though his life has just changed.Javed goes to school and excitedly tells Roops how he listened to both tapes and feels as though Bruce knows exactly how he feels. He becomes inspired to continue writing, and he even brings his collection of poems to Ms. Clay for her to read. Naturally, Malik disapproves of Javed listening to The Boss. The family is then visited by a neighbour, Mr. Evans (David Hayman). He found one of Javed's poems in which he speaks against the National Front, who are planning a march. As a former WWII soldier, Mr. Evans sympathizes with Javed's feelings and tells him he wrote a brilliant poem. However, Javed's parents are less appreciative.Javed returns to the head of the school paper with a piece he wrote on Springsteen. He insists that it be read, so the head gives it a shot. Meanwhile, Malik becomes aggravated over the mounting bills he cannot pay, and he is even more stressed out since Yasmeen is set to be married, and he doesn't think he can pay for the wedding. He has the rest of the family pool their money together to support each other. Javed goes around town looking for a job, while still listening to more Bruce.Javed goes to a restaurant with Roops, when they are forced out of their seats by three racist punks. Javed realizes he left a tape on the table and goes to get it, but even as one of the punks refuses to give it back, Javed retaliates by proudly quoting ""Badlands"" with Roops, and they walk out of the restaurant the better men.At a local flea market, Javed meets Matt and his father (Rob Brydon), who also shares Javed's love for The Boss. Javed asks Matt's dad for a job since he operates the place, and he says he can give him something but it wouldn't pay a lot. He then sees Eliza there with her friends, and, with Matt's dad's help, Javed sings ""Thunder Road"", which charms Eliza and the crowd. However, Matt's dad starts to mock Matt for his lack of musical know-how, which deeply upsets him, especially since Javed doesn't back him up. This causes a rift between the two friends.Javed works up the nerve to ask Eliza out on a date. She picks the place to go, which is a rave spot. Javed doesn't feel right about going in, so he nearly ditches the date until he listens to more Bruce. He sings ""Prove It All Night"" to let Eliza know he is staying, and the two share their first kiss. The next morning, he leaves a poem taped to Eliza's window, which she loves.During Ms. Clay's class, she tells Javed that she loved his poems. She mentions having a friend at the Luton Herald, and she can get Javed in to have unpaid work experience, which he is thankful for.Javed and Roops want to join the school's radio station to play non-stop Springsteen as a regular show, but the station's head denies them. The boys later sneak into the station after the head leaves, and they play ""Born To Run"" for all the school to hear, while locking the door to the station to prevent anyone from stopping it. The two then go out on the town with Eliza after school for a fun time out, which ends as they come across the town's mosque which has a severed pig's head hanging from it in another racist act of intimidation.Eliza invites Javed over for dinner to meet her parents. They are NOT subtle about their thoughts on the pair, as they believe that Eliza always brings home any type of guy that might provoke them. Javed tries his best to hide his discomfort, even as they prove so inconsiderate that they insist on serving him alcohol even after their daughter tells them it's against his religion.Javed and Roops are called into the Headmistress's office about the radio station prank, but after giving her an apology, they don't get in any serious trouble for it. He later gets into an argument with Malik over working for the Herald without pay, which Malik complains is a waste of time regardless of the work experience to be gained. As he walks home by himself, Javed sees Matt, who is still not talking to him. When he finally does, he expresses his dismay for Javed not defending him in front of his dad when Matt has stuck up for Javed against racist pricks before. Javed notices that Mr. Evans overheard everything, and his advice to the boy is that ""good friends deserve to be heard."" With this advice, Javed goes to apologize to Matt, and Matt gets excited when he learns that Javed now has a girlfriend.Javed has Eliza over his house to make out, but they are seen by Shazia. She promises not to tell their parents on the condition that Javed does something that she wants to do. Javed agrees and later takes her to a dance hall for a daytimer dance party with other British Pakistanis where they can be themselves without their parents' interference.At the Herald, Javed is asked to cover a story about the mosque, in which he receives payment. He keeps this information from his parents.On the day of Yasmeen's wedding, Javed learns that Bruce is coming to Wembley, and it may be his one chance to see him live. Hoping to secure tickets before they are sold out, he runs to buy tickets from Emma with the money he earned at work, only to find that he needn't have rushed considering that there are plenty and selling relatively slowly. While the family is driving to the wedding, they are stopped by police as the National Front is making their march, calling for an all-white Britain. Eliza is among the protesters there. Malik and a friend of his get out of their car and are attacked by NF members. Javed rushes to the scene to find his father injured and on the ground. Later, Javed is chastised for not being there, and he admits that he got the concert tickets with money from work. Furthermore, the situation escalates when Mr. Evans arrives to congratulate for his Herald story that headlines the front page. Malik is angry that Javed is stirring up trouble in his eyes for publicly defending the mosque instead of keeping a low profile like everyone else and having his own money that he didn't give to the family, and Malik takes the tickets and rips them up. Javed angrily tells Malik he doesn't want to be his son, and that he wants more out of his life and leaves in anger. The words stun Malik and Noor.At school, even Eliza can't believe that Javed abandoned his family for concert tickets. He says they shouldn't be together because of them, and she berates him for using his family as an excuse. In class, Ms. Clay tells Javed that she submitted a piece of his work for a contest, and he was selected to be part of a field trip to visit Monmouth College in New Jersey for their writing program. Ms. Clay also notes that he would be close to Asbury Park where Bruce grew up. Javed knows his father wouldn't let him go, so he turns it down. However, he changes his mind and tells Malik that he plans on going. Malik tells Javed that if he leaves, he is not to come back. Refusing to be intimidated, Javed proceeds to pack his bags.Javed and Roops take the trip to the States to visit Jersey and Asbury Park, an itinerary which proves to help his entry through Customs when the officials pleased at foreigners coming to visit the Boss' hometown. It inspires Javed to write something new. Back home, Noor tells Malik that he needs to fix things with his son, as he left his own family and country at a young age as well. After that argument, Malik finds and reads one of Javed's poems, ""Father and Son.""Javed is picked to read his winning paper to the school. Eliza talks to Noor and gets Javed's whole family to show up in support. Javed sees his family and delivers his reading without looking at the paper. He talks about how he heard ""Blinded By The Light"" and was reminded of Malik and his own father, and how he thinks Bruce would understand how Malik felt about his anger toward his own dreams not going out as planned to provide for his family. Everyone is moved, and they applaud Javed. He reconciles with Eliza and thanks her for inviting his family. Malik then talks to Javed and admits that he has listened to Bruce, and he admires his lyrics about being a good person and respecting your family.Javed is set to go off to his university. He bids Matt farewell and receives a demo CD with new lyrics that Javed wrote. After saying goodbye to Noor and Shazia, Javed prepares to drive off with Malik. He starts playing Pakistani music on the radio, but Malik changes it so that they listen to ""Born To Run"" together. As they drive out of town, Javed sees his younger self waving to him.We then see pictures of the real Javed Khan, who has seen The Boss in concert over 150 times and has met him personally. He is also still great friends with Roops (also pictured) to this day."

Weary but still as-silent-as-the-grave, Sheeran recounts his pivotal first murder; his ties to the notorious Bufalino crime family; the assassination ofJohn F. Kennedy; the energetic crusade of the Attorney General,Robert F. Kennedy, and his alleged connection to the murder of the American labour union leader and President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,Jimmy Hoffa. Now, reconciliation is the only means to salvation. What's it like to be the last man standing?—Nick Riganas A war veteran narrates the true story and journey of how he was hired as a hitman for a wealthy family and how he assassinated someone by becoming trustworthy friends with them, and how it all of this affected his relationship with his own family.—RECB3 The film opens in the early 2000's in a retirement home. Sitting alone in a wheelchair is Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). He reflects on his life leading up to where he is now, starting with his profession as a ""house painter"" - in other words, a hit-man.In the 1950's, Frank, a World War II veteran, lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania working as a truck driver for a meat-packing company. He's married to Mary (Aleksa Palladino) and has a daughter, Peggy (Lucy Gallina). In his work, he meets Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who advises him to get his truck fixed. When Frank asks Russell his name, he instead changes the subject before bidding Frank farewell.Frank starts to rub elbows with local gangster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale), providing him with some of the goods he carries. On a delivery, a client sees that Frank's truck is empty, and his employers accuse him of stealing. Frank goes to lawyer Bill Bufalino (Ray Romano), who helps Frank avoid legal repercussions by telling him to not give up the names of anybody that he was selling to. Later on, Bill formally introduces Frank to Russell, who is his cousin. Frank and Russell eat together, in which Frank discusses his time in the war, and how he was skilled at taking out enemy soldiers.Frank is asked by a gangster called Whispers (Paul Herman) to take out Russell and his buddy Angelo Bruno (Harvey Keitel). Frank doesn't go through with it and instead brings this information to Russell and Angelo, and when Frank offers to return the money to Whispers, Angelo assures Frank that he won't be needing it anymore.One afternoon, Frank goes home to see that Peggy is looking upset. Mary tells him that she knocked something over at the supermarket, and the store owner shoved her. Frank takes Peggy back to the store where he violently confronts the store owner, beating him and throwing him through the glass door before assaulting him in the street, in full view of Peggy and others walking by. This leads Peggy to become terrified of her father.Russell brings Frank in on his crime business as a hit-man, and he becomes well acquainted with a number of other gangsters (the onscreen text letting us know how all of them died horribly). During this time, Frank leaves Mary for a woman named Irene (Stephanie Kurtzuba), and they later have two other daughters, Connie and Dolores. He is eventually contacted by union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) after hearing about his work ""painting houses"". Present Day Frank informs us that there is more to Jimmy that people don't know other than his famed disappearance. Jimmy leads the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and is also in league with Russell and his gang. Jimmy also has an issue with Teamsters Vice President Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provezano (Stephen Graham), as he has his own plans for his business. Frank becomes a bodyguard for Jimmy, and he also brings him along to meet the family. Peggy is most fond of Jimmy, even more so than she is of Russell, whom she knows is bad news.Jimmy and his Teamsters are staunchly against the Kennedys, which makes JFK's election in 1960 hit a serious nerve for Jimmy. He rants to his men, and with Frank in the room, he thinks he is yelling at him too, but Jimmy assures Frank that he is not including him in the rant. In November 1963, after JFK is assassinated, Jimmy makes an insensitive comment to the press that Bobby Kennedy (Jack Huston), the former General Attorney, is now ""just another lawyer."" Bobby later forms a squad to go after Jimmy, and he is eventually arrested for jury tampering. In Jimmy's absence, the Teamsters is taken over by Frank ""Fitz"" Fitzsimmons (Gary Basaraba), who starts to use the group's funds for himself or to make loans to the mob.In prison, Jimmy finds that Tony Pro is also there for extortion. Tony makes some attempt to hash out his issues with Jimmy, but they can't reach an agreement, and it just leads to them getting into a brawl, which is broken up by guards and other inmates.During a parade, a random mobster is shot dead in the middle of a crowd. Frank and Russell figure that the gunman was sent by Crazy Joe Gallo (Sebastian Maniscalco), who works with black gangsters to carry out his dirty work. As the name suggests, Joe is a hotheaded loose cannon. On his birthday, Frank and Russell accompany Joe to see Don Rickles (Jim Norton) perform, in which Joe almost snaps at Rickles for a joke. The mobsters agree that Joe is too much of a liability, so Frank is sent to take him out. Present Day Frank recalls picking specific guns to do the job. He catches Joe having dinner with his family at Umberto's, whereupon he shoots at Joe before following him outside and finishing him off in the streets, then making a getaway.In 1971, Jimmy is released from prison after Richard Nixon gives him a presidential pardon, but he can't go back to the Teamsters. Regardless, Jimmy makes an effort to rise back to power, which involves dumping on other Teamster leaders and disregarding crime family activities. Russell asks Frank to talk to Jimmy about his behavior, but Jimmy assures Frank that he can't be harmed, or else anyone involved will go to jail.We then jump to 1975 where Frank, Russell, Irene, and Russell's wife Carrie (Kathrine Narducci) are headed to a wedding for Bill's daughter (the film had been cutting back and forth between this since the beginning). Russell tells Frank that it's time for Jimmy to be taken care of. Frank arrives in Detroit after Jimmy is set to meet with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone (Patrick Gallo). Jimmy is surprised to see Frank with his foster son Chuckie O'Brien (Jesse Plemons) and fellow gangster Sally Bugs (Louis Cancelmi) after thinking Tony Pro stood him up. He is told that the meeting has been moved to another house where Tony and Russell are waiting for him. Frank takes Jimmy to the house, where Jimmy finds that it's empty. Growing nervous and suspicious, Jimmy starts to walk out, only for Frank to shoot him twice in the back of the head. Frank leaves Jimmy's body there, and it is later picked up by two other men who cremate his body.Jimmy's disappearance becomes nationwide news. The Sheeran family watches at home, and after Frank offhandedly mentions he hasn't called Jo (Jimmy's wife) yet, Peggy (now played by Anna Paquin), realizes her father had something to do with whatever happened to Jimmy. Present Day Frank informs us that this is the day that Peggy stopped speaking to him.Frank, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are arrested for suspicions of Jimmy's disappearance, while guys like Sally Bugs are murdered. Tony Pro dies, while Frank spends one last moment with Russell in prison before Russell is wheeled away to the hospital, where he later dies.Frank is later released from prison and is sent to the retirement home. He has been diagnosed with cancer and he can barely walk. He visits Peggy at her bank job, but she walks away the moment she sees Frank, even as he begs her to talk to him. His attempts to reconcile with his other daughters is also unsuccessful. With this, Frank simply prepares for his death. He picks out a green coffin and the spot where he wants to be buried.At the end of the night, Frank is taken to his room by an orderly. He asks the orderly to leave the door open, holding out hope that maybe someone in his family will still care to visit him."

Captive State,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968394/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Set in a Chicago neighborhood nearly a decade after an occupation by an extraterrestrial force, 'Captive State' explores the lives on both sides of the conflict - the collaborators and dissidents. Nearly a decade after occupation by an extraterrestrial force, the lives of a Chicago neighborhood on both sides of the conflict are explored. In a working-class Chicago neighborhood occupied by an alien force for nine years, increased surveillance and the restriction of civil rights have given rise to an authoritarian system - and dissent among the populace.—yusufpiskin Chicago, 2027. Unable to defend our world against the multitudes of far superior extraterrestrial invaders, the Earth has capitulated to the alien forces and their new appointed rulers, the otherworldly Legislators. And having established a new order, the unearthly intruders have managed to control the enslaved population nearly one long decade after the invasion. Under those circumstances, young survivor Gabriel secretly joins the Phoenix resistance group, catching the attention of Chicago Police Commander William Mulligan: a faithful collaborator obsessed with finding the insurgents. But now, there is no turning back. Can the spark of freedom ignite a war?—Nick Riganas In 2019, Chicago is placed under martial law after a global extraterrestrial invasion. As the Drummond family attempts to flee the city, they break through a barricade but are confronted by the aliens, who vaporize the parents but leave their sons Gabriel and Rafe alive.By 2027, the world has capitulated to the alien ""Legislators"", submitting to their governance. Humans are conscripted to build ""Closed Zones"", underground habitats for the aliens with access only granted by high government officials.Gabriel Drummond (Ashton Sanders), living in the impoverished Pilsen neighborhood, is confronted by Chicago Police Special Branch Commander William Mulligan (John Goodman), who was partnered with Gabriel's father before the invasion. Mulligan is convinced that the Phoenix resistance group has not been neutralized, contrary to what the public has been told, but Gabriel offers him no information.Gabriel meets with a member of Phoenix to sell a hand-rolled cigarette containing secret information received from a coworker. The man takes him to Wicker Park, where he meets his brother Rafe (Majors), the leader of the resistance. Rafe takes the coded cigarette and directs Gabriel to leave as Phoenix is planning to attack the upcoming Unity Rally at Soldier Field. Rushing to his apartment and hastily packing, Gabriel is again confronted by Mulligan, who had him under surveillance. Gabriel evades Mulligan and hides underground.The cigarette's code allows Rafe's team to access Chicago's surveillance system and the deployment patterns of law enforcement units. Rafe and other Phoenix members attack the Unity Rally, using an invisible alien explosive device against the aliens when they arrive. The attack initially appears successful, but the city is subsequently locked down and swarmed by security forces in response. Angered by the attack, the aliens bring in hunters from off-world to seek out the perpetrators, finding Rafe and his accomplices Anita (Caitlin Ewald) and Daniel (Ben Daniels). Anita is vaporized and Daniel ingests a cyanide pill to avoid capture, but Rafe is shot and arrested by Mulligan before he can take cyanide.Gabriel emerges from hiding but is taken into custody during a police raid. Mulligan shows him his brother being tortured for information and convinces him to send a message through the Phoenix network in hopes of meeting the supposed ringleader, Number One. Gabriel is eventually led to Jane Doe, a prostitute running a brothel in Pilsen, who acknowledges him by name, confusing Gabriel. Police raid the house, and Doe is killed.The subsequent investigation reveals that Doe bugged her own residence to record conversations with Special Branch members and glean classified information. The tapes reveal that Police Commissioner Eugene Igoe (Kevin Dunn) divulged sensitive information about the aliens' arrival to Soldier Field which allowed Phoenix to develop their attack strategy. Igoe, along with Rafe and many others, are deported off-world and Mulligan, declaring the Chicago threat neutralized, is promoted to Acting Commissioner.Mulligan meets with Gabriel privately, with Gabriel lamenting that Rafe's plan failed. Mulligan, retrieving a box earlier received from Doe, reveals a BlackBerry phone, giving the memory card to Gabriel and suggesting that failure was the plan all along. Gabriel reviews the card's contents - a video depicting his own baby shower, and revealing Jane Doe taught at the same school as his mother. It was at the shower that she was introduced to Mulligan, with several Phoenix members present, and the video closes with Mulligan leaving a message for Gabriel, inspiring him to carry the torch of Phoenix.Meanwhile, Mulligan is cleared to meet with the Legislators underground. As he descends, the invisible substance of the powerful alien explosive envelops him, indicating he is part of the resistance and that the whole 'failed' plan was orchestrated to allow him to deal a fatal blow to the Legislators.During the credits, a map details that the Closed Zone was successfully destroyed, with other resistance strikes and protests having broken out in cities all over the world, indicating that the opening exhortation to ""spark a match and ignite a war"" has led humanity to attempt to overthrow their alien oppressors."

However, when the earth sailed to Jupiter, because of some failures, the earth could not escape Jupiter's gravity. The hero, Liu's father, works on the space station. When he discovered that the space station explosion could ignite Jupiter's gas, he piloted the space station to ignite Jupiter. The story was written more than 20 years ago by the most famous Sci-Fi writer in China, Liu CiXin, who is also the executive producer of this film. It tells the first part of the story. The whole novel can easily become a trilogy.
The time is in the early 22nd century. The Sun goes through a rapidly deteriorating phrase. In 100 years it will destroy the earth. In order to survive, human society goes through a drastic change: all the countries are merged to form the ""United Earth Government (UEG)"". They build 10,000 gigantic heavy-material-fusion propulsion engines to slowly push the Earth out of the original orbit. It takes 20 years to reach the Jupiter, which its massive gravity should serve as the sling for the frozen Earth to accelerate through. Yet things go very wrong in that faithful day, when Earth is passing the Jupiter.
The protagonist, Liu Qi (nicknamed Hu Kou, kind of an inside joke of Chinese), is a young machinist of heavy trucks. He smuggles some special instant inflatable bubble capsules to the local thugs, in exchange of special suits to go outside of the underground bunker. He brings his little sister along for her favor of stealing his grandpa's truck key. After slipping through the thugs' chasing they get into an elevator to the surface.
Outside they are awed to see the huge structure called ""earth engine"", which is only one of the 10,000. They find the special truck their grandpa drives and use the stolen key card to drive it. Just when the joy ride is almost over, they are caught and thrown into jail. Their grandpa comes and tries to bride the jail warden, only gets thrown into the same cell as Liu Qi's.
Meanwhile on a space station called ""The Navigator"", their father, Liu Pei Qiang, is getting ready to return to earth. It is his last shift, and it's exactly the same day the Earth is supposed to glide past the Jupiter and accelerate to achieve the necessary speed of flying out of the solar system. Suddenly Jupiter's gravity becomes irregular and the Earth has a huge tremor. Many earth engine go offline, and the underground cities are crushed or drown by lava. Liu Qi, his sister and the grandpa escaped the prison with a cellmate called Tim. Grandpa drive his heavy truck and narrowly escapes death.
In the space station, the main computer AI, called MOSS, warns everyone that the space station will go into low energy mode, and they should go back to their sleeping bay. Liu Pei Qiang, the father, calls the grandpa and is surprised to learn that they are in a truck together. He directs the truck to the nearest bunker. After that he goes to his quarter and prepare to hibernate.
The truck is intercepted by a team of elite Chinese soldiers. They need the truck to tow a precious cargo called ""lighter core"", which can be used to ignite earth engines. The grandpa is not happy but has to obey their order. The father calls again and request the captain of the team to let them go into a bunker, for that the captain promises they will let everyone go except the grandpa for his job of driving.
After some time, the grandpa drives them to Shanghai, where the huge tremor has torn open a long gap, showing the old city covered by ice. As the truck goes into the gap, the grandpa tell stories about his memories in the city. (A deleted scene shows thousands of people frozen solid in the ice, revealing the sister's origin. She is among the few survivors of that disaster.) A second tremor hit and cliffs on both sides of the gap start collapsing. Everyone has to abandon their vehicles to go into the tallest building of Shanghai. In the effort of escaping the team loses a soldier, and the grandpa dies when the tall building collapses. Liu Qi blames his death on the captain, and refuses to continue. The elite team carries the lighter core themselves and march toward the earth engine in Hangzhou, while Liu Qi, his sister and Tim go their way back toward their home.
In the space station, just after the hibernation program starts, Liu Pei Qiang, the father, learns from MOSS that the grandpa's truck is missing, the ground has a new round of chaos, and the AI is preparing to leave Earth behind. He struggles to break the circuits inside the bay and gets out from it. MOSS the AI wakes up other members in his team, trying to rectify the situation, but the Russian teammate, Markarov, decides to help him instead. They open a hatch closest to the control center and flies out into the vacuum. To reach the control center, Markarov sacrifices himself and pushes Liu toward a moving arm. Liu gets hold of the exterior of the control center and gets in by overriding a hatch's control.
On the earth, Liu Qi, the son, and his companions finds a crashed plane with a truck intact. Inside that truck, they meet the sole survivor, a crazy genius, Li, who told them that the Jupiter's gravity is sucking Earth's atmosphere to such a degree that the air is too thin to even fly the plane, thus the crash. He asks them to rescue a torque engine (bigger earth engine) in Sulaweisi in the equator. The truck is their last chance to turn back and go home, yet Liu Qi decides to rescue the earth engine in Hangzhou first.
In the space station, Liu PeiQiang, the father, gets into the computer room and tries to override MOSS, yet the AI informs him that it is merely carrying out orders authorized by the Unite Earth Government. The ship Navigator contains all the necessary DNA and materials to start the civilization in a distant planet. So even if the Earth fell into Jupiter, the human race will continue.
Outside of Hangzhou, the elite team finds out that the whole city is lost to the lava. The earth engine there is damaged beyond repairing. A teammate died from the bitter cold. They have a fight about whether to continue the mission. A female soldier shoots at the lighter core and breaks it. The captain almost kills her for it. Just when they are all desperate, the truck driven by Liu Qi shows up, and they now have a new mission: escort the other lighter core inside the truck to Sulaweisi.
When they finally almost reach Sulaweisi, some other teams has successfully repaired the engines before them. However, the reading shows that the Earth is still heading toward Jupiter. All the engines' force combined cannot make Earth escape the gravity well of Jupiter.
In the space station, after MOSS explains to Liu that all the rescue missions are actually useless, it opens a channel to the Earth and broadcast to everyone that they have only 7 days, until the earth get torn apart. Listening the bad news, the genius Li cries that they actually have only one day to live, while the air of the earth being sucked by Jupiter at that rate.
Watching the tremendous Jupiter looming over his head, Liu Qi suddenly has an idea: Earth's oxygen mixed with Jupiter's Hydrogen can be ignited and generate a big boom. Li agrees with him, so he develops a new plan to rescue the Earth: Liu and Tim drive the truck to deliver the lighter core; elite soldiers push a giant igniter pin, Li and another tech will go to the control room, and Liu's sister and the female soldier will go to the communication room.
The plan suffers major setbacks: the core is delivered but machine is stuck, soldiers have too little manpower to push the pin, Li's program is uploaded but freeze at 99%, Liu's sister's call for help get no response. She suddenly realizes that she can make an emergency call to the space station and ask for Liu PeiQiang's help.
Liu receive the call, but MOSS tells him that someone else already had this idea, and the successful chance is zero, but he still calls the UEG and pleas for authorization. UEG only agrees to broadcast the sister's message to all remaining rescuers.
Liu's sister cries and beg for the hope to save Earth. Many rescuers return and help the soldiers pushing the giant pin. Liu Qi, the son, finally get the machine unstuck, then they drive the truck running away from the engine. Everything is ready except the launch program. The tech is badly hurt by falling rocks, but he manages to put the right cable in the socket. The program finally get uploaded 100%. The genius Li starts the program, right after Liu's truck barely makes it outside.
The torque engine (the bigger earth engine) shoot a straight red light toward the giant eye of the Jupiter, but the power cannot reach the ignition area. It is short by 5000km. The father, Liu PeiQiang, remembers that the Navigator has 30,000 tons of fuel, which should generate a 5000km of flame if ignited. The AI, MOSS, tries to stop him but fails. Liu burns the computer and manually drives the space station toward the red light.
Before the space station is destroyed by the red light, the two Liu have a final conversation. The father repeats that when you look at the Jupiter, you will see me. The son looks up at the huge red eye above and see his father's ship turns into a fire ball. Jupiter's atmosphere is burning. A gigantic impact wave is coming.
People scramble to get into the underground bunker. Liu Qi find his sister with Tim, but the elevator is broken. The genius Li advises them to hide under the torque engine, which they complies, but before they can reach the engine, the impact wave arrives and destroys the truck they are riding, throwing them out. Tim holds on a pipe, but Liu sees his sister dropping down so he falls toward her. In the air he catches her and deploys an instant bubble capsule, which saves both of their lives. Liu's helmet is broken by the fall. The cold air is killing him. The last glimpse he catches tells him that the Earth survives the ordeal, then he closes his eyes...
Time jumps to three years later. Earth goes on. Liu Qi becomes a junior driver. Everyone respects him and smiles at him. Their journey will continue in the next movie, perhaps. The first one is already good enough."

The Goldfinch,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3864056/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A boy in New York is taken in by a wealthy family after his mother is killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In a rush of panic, he steals 'The Goldfinch', a painting that eventually draws him into a world of crime. 13-year-old New Yorker Theo Decker's life is turned upside-down when his mother is killed in a terrorist attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Confused in the rubble of the tragedy, he steals a priceless piece of art known as The Goldfinch. There has been one defining event in early twenty-something Theo Decker's life, it which separates his life into before the event and after the event, and which has directly or indirectly shaped everything important since: a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City when Theo was thirteen. Theo and his mother were in the museum at the time, she killed in the explosion while Theo was in a different part of the museum. Theo has blamed himself for her death in he being the reason for their unplanned trip there. With his alcoholic father out of the picture and his whereabouts unknown, Theo went to live temporarily with the upper middle class Barbour family, that of one of his few friends, Andy Barbour, until a more permanent situation could be arranged. Another item specifically tied to that day is that out of circumstance, Theo stole a famous painting, The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, it since thought to having been destroyed in the explosion. Theo also comes to understand that there were others affected by the bombing, including the Blackwell family, antiques dealer and reburbisher Welty Blackwell also subsequently perishing from the explosion, while his young teen daughter, Pippa Blackwell, was, like Theo, emotionally traumatized and physically injured in the explosion. Theo not only befriends Pippa but also Welty's business partner in Blackwell + Hobart, James Hobart, familiarly referred to as Hobie, in Welty, just before his death, asking Theo to return something to Hobie for him. Theo's actions are largely dictated by having The Goldfinch in his possession, he not having told anyone of that fact.—Huggo A boy, Theo, is noticeably shaken and being held by the police. His mother has died after an explosion during a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He feels he is responsible for the death of his mother. The whereabouts of his father are unknown. He has given the police the name of a mother, Samantha Barbour, whose family he knows from school. The woman agrees to take responsibility of him as an obligation since no one in Theo's family is available. He is clearly emotionally devastated, but shows no sign of crying. Police repeatedly ask him questions about his location, his mother's location, who and what else he has seen around the time of the explosion, etc. The woman stands up for him and his apparent lack of memory. Theo goes home with the mother. He makes good friends with Andy, the curly-haired son who is just under his age. The family is somewhat dysfunctional, especially visible in incidents involving the strong-willed father and the impudent oldest son, Platt.We learn that Theo had received a ring from a man killed in the blast. He was asked to return it to Hobart and Blackwell. Theo resourcefully finds the address of Hobart and Blackwell in the phone book and ventures out to deliver the ring. He is invited in and develops a friendship with the antique dealer, Hobie, who had lost his business partner Welty in the blast. Hobie is taking care of Pippa, the red-haired daughter of Welty Blackwell who Theo admired immediately before the blast. Pippa has major head injuries and spends most of her time in bed and is discouraged from listening to music since she needs rest more than music practice. Pippa and Theo have a strong bond since both just lost the main part of their families in the explosion. Pippa's mother had already passed away prior to the explosion due to illness.Theo spends time at both the Barbour family and the Hobie's shop and home. He learns about antique restoration from Hobie. He develops stronger ties to Andy and Mrs. Barbour. Theo is invited to join them for their summer vacation. However, soon after that invitation, Theo's father shows up along with his girlfriend. Theo disappointedly is required to travel off to live with his father, Larry, and the father's girlfriend, Xandra, in a mostly foreclosed neighborhood at the edge of the desert. Life is lonely at the new school and in the neighborhood, until Theo meets another loner named Boris. Boris is an awkward classmate who has lived many places as his father is a miner. Boris has no mother and his father is typically away. This allows plenty of time for Boris to shoplift, experiment with drugs, and get into other mischief. Some of these habits are adopted by Theo as well.Through flashbacks, we learn that Theo immediately after the explosion had been encouraged by Welty to take the valuable painting, The Goldfinch, as Welty was dying. Theo had kept it wrapped up, sporadically hugging it as it was a source of comfort, his mother's favorite painting, and the last art he had seen before his life was radically changed. It becomes more and more clear that Theo's life all began its downward spiral right at the moment of that terrible explosion.Larry happens to be in serious debt trouble and attempts to get Theo to transfer $65,000 out of the inheritance from his mother. The plan fails as the money can only be transferred directly to a school. Larry is in despair and ends up getting extremely drunk and killing himself in an auto accident. Theo and Boris learn of the father's death during one of their drug trips. Soon after, Theo decides that he must leave before he is assigned to a foster home. He heads back to New York and moves in with Hobie.The next scene shows Theo after a few years have passed, and we see Theo as a young man -- no longer a boy. Hobie has taught Theo about antique restoration and Theo joins Hobie's company, working as the sales arm of Hobart and Blackwell. His assistance leads to increased financial success, although it becomes clear that sometimes Theo is selling the reproductions as authentic antiques and not just as stated, high-quality reproductions of antiques as Hobie had intended.A dissatisfied customer complains to Theo that he had been tricked during his purchase of furniture that was offered to him as an authentic. To further avoid trouble, Theo offers to buy it back even beyond the purchase price. However, the customer actually knows far more, has done extensive research, and announces that he knows that Theo had taken ""The Goldfinch"". Theo does not let on that he took it or has it. Tensions are high and the customer later divulges his knowledge to the highly honest Hobie. Hobie confronts Theo about the new information, and Theo regretfully confesses to a much disappointed Hobie that the claim is true.Other tragedies have occurred. Andy and his father had passed away during a storm on the open seas, and this has hit Mrs. Barbour hard. As for Theo's love life: Theo's true love, Pippa is committed to another man. Theo has therefore focused his affection for the now grown-up daughter, Kitsey, of Mrs. Barbour. However, Theo finds that even while engaged, Kitsey has been and remains romantically involved with another man who she loves -- clearly not to the liking of Theo.In coping with the continued tragedies, Theo continues his drug habits, and this once again brings him by chance in contact with the now grown-up Boris. Boris is more wealthy now and has his own driver. Boris confesses that he had actually taken the painting ""The Goldfinch"" years ago from Theo. Theo had last opened it up during one of their drug trips, of which Theo had no recall. Boris had actually during the high-school days, secretly taken the painting and unbeknownst to Theo, replaced it with a Civics book.Since then, the painting was truly lost and out of the country, no longer in Boris's possession. However, Boris had a plan to get it back, to set things right again between him and Theo. The plan involved money and guns and dealing with professional crooks and did not go well. The painting was again lost. Theo was now at the bottom of his spiral, took a lethal dose of drugs and began hallucinating. Just then, Boris rushes into the hotel room, forces Theo to vomit the drugs out and returns Theo back to life. Boris also had served as an informant about the missing painting and delivers Theo the news that the police have finally found ""The Goldfinch"" and have returned it to its rightful place in the museum. The movie allows one to wonder after his second chance if Theo can overcome and achieve the life to eventually surmount the terrible event."
The Mustang,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5952594/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"While participating in a rehabilitation program training wild mustangs, a convict at first struggles to connect with the horses and his fellow inmates, but he learns to confront his violent past as he soothes an especially feisty horse. In the inconclusive assessment in his initial placement as reintegration into the general population at the Nevada correctional facility where he's been housed, long term inmate Roman Coleman, a brooding loner, is assigned to outdoor maintenance, which largely entails shoveling the manure from around the animal enclosures. Noticing his seemingly natural draw to the horses, Myles asks that Coleman be reassigned to his rehabilitation program: the training of captured wild mustangs ultimately to be sold at auction. The program matches each inmate solely to one animal to train, Coleman who names his mustang, one of the more spirited ones, Marquis. The ebbs and flows in Coleman's time in the program with Marquis may mirror Coleman's own ebbs and flows in his reintegration in light of the issues he faces in dealing with various groups and individuals: the prison administration; Myles and the others in the training program; the general prison population; and the one and only visitor he currently receives, his pregnant young adult daughter Martha who has only come to clear up some administrative family issues, and thus who would have not wanted to see her father otherwise.—Huggo"

She is not the type of girl who meets a cute boy on a crowded New York City street and falls in love with him. Not when her family is 12 hours away from being deported. Falling in love with him will not be her story. Daniel has always been the good son, the good student, living up to his parents' high expectations. Never a poet. Or a dreamer.

She has a keen interest in science and learning what she can. She also notes how her parents met when Samuel walked into Patricia's store one day, and he, a hopeless romantic, fell for her. Unfortunately, she and her family are set to be deported back to Jamaica the next day. Natasha is determined to change this, so she makes an appointment with the immigration office to try and reverse their decision. She meets with an attorney, Lester Barnes, and after asking questions, Natasha makes a tearful plea for her parents' case, so Lester gives her a card to contact another lawyer friend of his, Jeremy Martinez, who can do pro bono work for her case.

Don't Let Go,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6803212/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After a man's family dies in what appears to be a murder, he gets a phone call from one of the dead, his niece. He's not sure if she's a ghost or if he's going mad, but as it turns out, he's not. Jack is a very supportive uncle to Ashley, always there when she calls. He plays a big role in her life due to her mother being busy a lot, and her dad living a gangster lifestyle. One day he (Jack) receives a frantic call from Ashley that gets cut short. When Jack arrives at Ashley's house and finds the whole family dead. Later he starts receiving calls from Ashley who is calling from the past. Jack must help Ashley change her almost inevitable fate.—howellwyland The film starts with Ashley Ratcliff (Storm Reid) calling her detective uncle Jack (David Oyelowo) to pick her up from the movies since her father forgot and her mother is too busy. Jack gets her and takes her to a diner for a meal. They discuss Ashley's father/Jack's brother Garret (Brian Tyree Henry), an aspiring musician/drug dealer whom both of them see as a screw-up. Jack promises to set Garret straight.The next day at work, Jack gets a phone call from Ashley, who says that Garret appears to be trying to do better after Jack apparently reamed him for neglecting his daughter. Hours later, Jack gets what sounds like a frantic call from Ashley. He rushes to her house and finds Garret dead, along with his wife Susan (Shinelle Azoroh) lying on the floor in her own blood. Their dog Wilco is dead too. Jack then tensely walks up to the bathroom, and to his horror, he finds Ashley dead in the shower. The case is ruled a murder-suicide, and Jack feels responsible for what he told Garret. Jack is supported by his partner Bobby (Mykelti Williamson)Two weeks later, Jack is still shaken from the scene. He then receives a strange phone call coming from Ashley's phone. He checks the evidence room for her phone and finds it there, meaning it can't be some kind of prank. He takes the phone and goes back to Garret's house where he starts speaking to what sounds like Ashley's voice. Jack is in utter disbelief.Bobby visits Jack to let him know that Internal Affairs is considering Jack as a suspect in his family's deaths. He is interviewed by IA agent Roger Lee (Byron Mann), who presses Jack with questions on what motivation he could have had to get rid of his family, like perhaps he was attracted to Susan and wanted Garret out of the way.Jack gets another call from Ashley. She starts repeating the same conversation she had with him right before she died (mentioning how Jack gave Garret an ""ear-full"" and ordering a garlic chicken dish Jack always recommended). As he walks around her house again, Jack asks Ashley to walk to the shed outside and tell him what she sees. She mentions a spray paint can and he tells her to paint a big red X on the shed's doors. Moments later, Jack closes the doors outside and sees the big X, to his surprise. Jack soon realizes that Ashley is calling him from two weeks in the past, days before her murder. He then hears Ashley saying she sees her father talking to someone that pulled up in a white car. Jack tells Ashley to try and make out the license plate, but she can't.At work, Jack starts to obsessively go over the case files and crime scene photos to try and find some kind of clue as to how to prevent his family's deaths. This brings the attention of his boss, Howard (Alfred Molina), who is growing concerned with Jack's behavior and suggests that he try to move on. Meanwhile in the past, Ashley tries to look into what her father is involved with per Jack's requests. She gets him the name ""Georgie"". Jack brings it up to Howard, who says that ""Georgie"" is a mysterious crime figure that has evaded capture for a long time. It is believed that Garret had drug dealings with Georgie that went bad, which led to the murders. Jack continues to investigate and realizes the murders were staged.Ashley calls Jack again and says she found Garret's day planner with Georgie's address. She tells him that she and Wilco are walking toward Jack's house, but Jack urges her to turn around due to Past-Jack not having any idea what is going on. When Jack gets back to his house, some gangsters drive by and shoot at him. He is shot in the side, but is otherwise fine. Jack takes himself to the police station and goes back into the evidence storage room with Bobby, who tries to send him to the hospital. Jack gets called by Ashley again, but he continues to dodge the truth to her and only tells her to call the cops and tell them to arrest Garret because someone is coming to kill him.

Medics show up to revive him.Ashley goes to Jack's house and asks him questions that he has no idea about. She becomes angered due to her belief that Jack is messing with her and keeping something from her. She tells him to leave her alone. When she returns home, she sees Garret playing the guitar while Susan watches. Ashley tries talking to her parents. It later leads to her and her family's murders again, only it happens a day earlier than it originally happened, and Ashley is found dead in her bedroom as she tried but failed to escape from there. This erases the current time-line that Jack was in.Jack remembers what has happened and he and Bobby arm themselves as he thinks Georgie's thugs are going to come after him again. In the past, Ashley (still alive) rides her bike to the warehouse where Garret is meeting with Georgie. She is spotted and then flees on her bike while being followed by a man.

Minnie tracks down Moondog at a local bar, and the two enjoy a night of intoxicated karaoke and dancing, culminating with Minnie drunkenly driving into oncoming traffic. Moondog escapes with minor injuries, but Minnie dies in the hospital shortly after.Half of Minnie's estate goes to Heather, while Moondog's half is frozen and placed under Heather's control; she will grant it to him once he proves he can mature and finish his novel. In retaliation, and due to Lewis' refusal to book seminars for Moondog due to his work ethic, Moondog recruits a group of homeless people and trashes Minnie's mansion. To avoid prison time, he agrees to a year of rehabilitation but breaks out of the facility with a pyromaniac named Flicker. The two part ways as Moondog makes his way back to Miami.He bumps into an old friend and alleged Vietnam veteran dubbed ""Captain Wack"" who offers Moondog an opportunity to co-captain dolphin tours around the outer Keys. Captain Wack decides to swim with the dolphins during a tour before realizing too late that they are sharks, which sever his foot. Now back in Miami and wanted by the law, Moondog reconnects with Lingerie, who confesses to Moondog about his affair with Minnie but claims Minnie truly loved Moondog. The revelations provoke little reaction from Moondog. After Lingerie and Jimmy Buffett tell Moondog about a respective dream and experience the two had concerning cross-dressing to avoid detection, Moondog begins to do just that. The police eventually bear down on Lingerie's property, prompting Moondog to flee to Key West with Lingerie's help and an undisclosed amount of the Jamaican weed.Inspired, Moondog completes his book, a poetic memoir titled The Beach Bum. The book is universally lauded and nets Moondog a Pulitzer Prize. A newly-divorced Heather is impressed with her father's strides and unfreezes his inheritance, which Moondog demands to be in physical cash and placed on a large sailboat. During a party to celebrate his wealth, Moondog lights the money on fire, triggering several fireworks and causing an explosion. Moondog survives unscathed, but the crowd is too concerned with the raining money to care as he drifts away on a boat."

She always wanted to come back to LA where her family is and where she's from but Charlie never really considered it, even turning own an opportunity to direct a play in LA.

Meanwhile, Charlie flies out to LA on breaks from his play rehearsals to see Henry. He tells Nicole he has received a MacArthur Genius Grant for his directing.

Nora preps Nicole for her meeting with the evaluator, explaining that even though fathers can have some leeway, mothers are always expected to be perfect. The evaluator comes to observe Charlie, and during dinner Henry asks Charlie to do his trick with his pocket knife. Charlie, worried, explains to the evaluator he would do a joke with Nicole where he would retract the knife and pretend to slash himself - only he accidentally does slash himself, bleeding profusely. After the evaluator leaves, he lies on the kitchen floor.Charlie and Nicole, both bleeding money in legal fees from the divorce, finally settle, Nora and Jay backing off the claims to come after the other's money. Henry will stay in LA, though Nora tells a confused Nicole that when Charlie is town despite what she thought, technically it's not shared custody - she got Nicole 55/45 percent, just because she didn't want Charlie to be able to say he won. In New York, at a jazz/singing bar with his cast, Charlie gets up and sings the song ""Being Alive"". The next Halloween, Nicole is happily dating someone new and nominated for an Emmy - for directing. Charlie comes to visit, and tells Nicole that he's taken a directing job in LA and will be there for a while. She's happy for him. Henry finds the letter Nicole wrote for the mediator when the divorce started and asks Charlie to help him read it. Charlie reads the letter and cries, while Nicole looks over his shoulder. At the end of trick or treating, Nicole asks if Charlie wants to take Henry for the night, even though it's her night for custody. He says yes, and as he's leaving, Nicole tells him to wait - she runs back, ties Charlie's untied shoe, and says goodbye."

Her lawyer Jimmy (Manav Kaul) hires prestigious defense attorney, Badal Gupta (Amitabh Bachchan) to defend her, and over the course of one late evening, they work together to find out what actually happened on that fateful day. Badal tells Naina that a witness has landed and it will result in her getting arrested in no time. Naina explains that she and Arjun were blackmailed by someone for their extramarital affair. They were called to a hotel room in a remote location and told to bring money. When they arrive, Naina receives a text from Arjun's phone saying that the blackmailer is going to reveal the truth. She is suddenly attacked and becomes unconscious. When she wakes up, she finds Arjun dead with the blackmail money scattered everywhere and the police knocking. Naina gets arrested but claims that she did not commit the murder. The police finds no clue of anyone else being present in the room or breaking in. The Allen key, which opens the windows of the hotel rooms, was removed due to heavy snow.Badal gets suspicious that Naina is not being honest with him and says he needs more information to build her case. He takes out the newspaper clipping about a youth named Sunny who had gone missing near the hotel and asks Naina how is she related to it.
Naina, then starts narrating her story. The story begins three months prior when she had lied to her husband about travelling to Paris for a business trip and instead went to a cabin outside of Scotland to meet Arjun. At the end of their getaway, Naina feels guilty about lying to her husband and daughter so she tells Arjun that she would like to end their relationship. While driving home, they get into a heated argument about this matter when a deer appears in front of the car and Naina loses control. She hits a car from the opposite direction. The impact kills the driver of the other car (Sunny). Naina panics but Arjun tells her that they cannot call the police if they want to proceed with their life. He convinces her that Sunny wasn't wearing a seat-belt and had been texting so his death was not their fault. They decide to flee but their own car fails to start and a car approaches them. Arjun hides Sunny's dead body and pretends that he is the owner of Sunny's car. When the driver stops to check, Naina and Arjun pretend that they are trading insurance information to deal with the accident. Sunny's phone starts ringing so Arjun answers it and pretends as if he is talking to insurance agents. Once the driver leaves convinced, Naina disposes off Sunny's car in a swamp.A couple, Rani (Amrita Singh) and Nirmal, stop their car and ask Arjun if he needs any help. Arjun is invited back to the couple's house to get Naina's car fixed. Upon arriving, he realizes that the couple are Sunny's parents, who are worried about their son. Rani calls to Sunny's phone and since Arjun forgot to dispose off Sunny's phone, it starts ringing. Arjun pretends that he had just been sitting on it but Rani and Nirmal are suspicious. Arjun and Naina return home but seeing Sunny on the news channel, they get worried that they will be discovered.
Soon, Naina is identified as a suspect in Sunny's disappearance when the couple identifies her vehicle. Naina had already disposed off her car and registers a missing case (fake) in Scotland. This prompts the officials to ask Naina for evidence of her time there. Since Naina was never in Paris, she has Jimmy falsify her alibi and is able to remove her name from Sunny's case. Arjun uses his wife's connections to the bank to make it seem as though Sunny had been stealing money from the bank and had run away. This way, the police no longer believe Sunny had been killed. However, Naina feels guilty and is upset at Arjun's actions. Refusing to believe her son could ever steal, Rani confronts Naina disguised as an economist at a business event. She reveals that she knows Naina had never been in Paris and that Naina is her last hope to know the whereabouts of her son. She also recognizes Naina's lighter, which Nirmal handed back to Arjun when he was leaving their house. Naina refuses to help Rani. A few months later, Naina and Arjun are contacted by a blackmailer. The blackmailer has Arjun throw away his phone prior to showing up at the Glen Moehr Hotel, the site of the murder. Thus, the blackmailer sends Naina a text prior to framing her.Badal decides that Rani had a motive for killing Arjun and could have easily done so since Nirmal works in the Glen Moehr Hotel (where Arjun was found murdered). He tells Naina that it is quite possible for Rani to have hidden in the room (before Arjun and Naina walked in) and received The Allen key for the window (from Nirmal), allowing a quick escape. They can blame Rani and Nirmal for Arjun's murder and get Naina out of the case. He also suggests to Naina that she should say that she was in Paris, as her records show, on the day of Sunny's murder, which will put the onus on Arjun as the murderer of Sunny. He pressures Naina to reveal the location of Sunny's body as he wants to tie Sunny's death to Arjun.
However, Naina, having gained trust in Badal, reveals that Sunny was alive in the trunk before she disposed off the car, but she decided to kill him in order to clear her name. Surprised by Naina's murderous and selfish actions, Badal proposes an alternate sequence of events in which Naina pressurized Arjun into hiding Sunny's disappearance. In this sequence of events, Arjun grows a guilty conscience to the point where he travels to the hotel to reveal the truth to Rani and Nirmal. He sends the text that Naina claims is from the blackmailer, prompting Naina to kill him. With the police knocking, Naina decides to injure herself and blame Rani for the crime. Naina refuses these events and claims that what Badal proposed before was the truth.Given this story, Badal refuses to fight Naina's case. Naina begs for Badal's help and Badal asks her to honestly reveal whether or not she killed Arjun. Naina confesses her role in Arjun's murder. Despite her guilty confession, Badal agrees to fight her case and reveals that there was no surprise witness. He had simply bluffed to make Naina tell him the truth. Badal then excuses himself in order to take a walk outside. Meanwhile, Naina receives a call from Jimmy. During the call, she realizes that Badal's pen is interfering with the call. When the real Badal Gupta arrives outside her door, Naina takes apart Badal's pen to reveal a voice recorder that had recorded every word of their meeting. She discovers that she had actually been speaking with Nirmal, who had disguised himself as Badal. Rani calls the police and Nirmal quotes the Mahabharata, saying that Draupadi's (Rani's) revenge has been taken by Yudhishthira (Nirmal).
The movie ends with another famous quote from Mahabharata, said by Nirmal: ""Its not always right to take revenge, but nor is it right to always forgive."""

In this uneasy arrangement, is there any hope left for humanity?—Nick Riganas It's five months after the end of WWII. Rachael Morgan has just joined her husband, British Army Colonel Lewis Morgan, in Hamburg, where he has been assigned as part of the Allied post-war mission to rebuild the city and to stamp out any Nazi or Nazi-sympathetic insurrection that may have lingered from the war. They are to live in the requisitioned country manor house belonging to widowed Stephen Lubert, an architect by trade before the war, and his teen daughter Freda Lubert, that requisitioning including keeping on a handful of the manor staff. Lewis has allowed the Luberts to remain living in a small wing of the house rather than they moving to the camp in he knowing the strain such would place on the city and his work. Rachael detests everything about this situation in not speaking the language, and living in a bombed out city, but mostly sharing the house with Germans who she blames for the death of her and Lewis' preteen son Michael Morgan when their home in London was hit with a bomb during the war, and pretending to be happy with a still largely absent Lewis, there existing a strain in their marriage ever since Michael's death, exacerbated in she knowing of a purposeful action by Lewis immediately after. Both Stephen and Freda are also emotionally scarred in Stephen's wife too a casualty of the war, Freda who is at an age of needing guidance as she grows into womanhood, and in losing their home despite not having been a member of the Nazi Party. In both of their emotional need, Rachael and Stephen eventually fall into each other's arms to embark in a romantic relationship. Beyond what is happening around them with Lewis' job and the war still on-going for some, the question becomes whether the other is what each of Rachael and Stephen is truly looking for in their need.—Huggo"

El Coyote,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8820136/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The Italian mob descends on the Mexican border to take on the most powerful cartel in America. Spencer, an ex-mobster in witness protection, battles the cartel who captured his son in Arizona, with his mob buddies coming to help. To protect one of their own, the Italian mob descends on the US/Mexico border, to take on the most powerful cartel On the US border.
""EL Coyote,"" is about a father's quest to both stop a kidnapping and save his own son's life - a son struggling to fight not only for his life but, as many, striving for the American Dream. ""EL Coyote"" is an hour of serious drama, misfortunes, death and lawlessness.
This film is a cross between the smash hit ""Breaking Bad"" and the gritty drama ""The Bridge."" Illegal drug manufacturing, distribution and selling all financed by money laundering activities as in ""Breaking Bad;"" cartel bloody killings, kidnappings and the slippery politics of Mexican law enforcement as in ""The Bridge.""
Stone Spencer is in his mid-50s and resides in Phoenix, Arizona. He's divorced from his ex-wife Sophie Spencer. They have one son, Jax, and a daughter, Carmen. Stone is a retired, ex-mobster formerly with the Bonanno crime family. He worked as an undercover special consultant for the US government: CIA ... and others. When the CIA needed plausible deniability, Stone was brought in as a NOC (Non-Official Cover). Stone always accomplished the mission. He will use all his talents to both save his son and protect his family.
The audience will remain in suspense as to how Stone got his skills - including his past - until the end of the season.
Jax Spencer is 29 years old. He's an ICE agent, having been with them for 5 years. He works out of the Nogales office in southern Arizona. Jake is six feet tall, very handsome, talented, smart, athletic, a great shot with the pistol and a steely-eyed KravMaga instructor. He has a beautiful fiancee's who is both a little nervous and very protective of Jake. Jake does not know about his father's past. He only knows his father may have helped some police or military agencies once or twice on a special occasion.
Jax's sister Carmen lives with their mother, Sophie. Carmen is a sixteen-year-old, and she is a typical teenager. She is a precocious knockout with incredible looks. She adores her older brother and has followed his whole career. Carmen becomes crazed when Jake gets kidnapped. She becomes unbalanced and runs away, searching for her brother. When she crosses the border into Mexico, this causes unimaginable problems for both her and her family. Carmen's mom, Sophie, has no choice but to go after her daughter.
Sophie Spencer, Stone's ex-wife, is a New Yorker with that characteristic New York attitude. In her late forties, she is still very attractive. Sophie pushes Stone to find and bring home their son. Sophie, knowing Stone's past and dogged determination well, begs him to help. There's still a little something special between them.
On a mission one day, Jax and 4 other agents get high-jacked and a gun battle breaks out. The 3 agents are killed and Jax is kidnapped by a band of human smugglers who are members of the ""Matutero Cartel."" ""Smuggler Cartel"" in English.
The Matuteros take Jax to their compound in Mexico. For Jake to survive, he must find someone to bring a significant number of illegal aliens, drugs and important cartel members - without papers - across the U.S. border. Once this happens, and the cartel is satisfied, Jake will be freed... We think.
CIA, ICE, DEA and others in our government will not help with a ""snatch and grab"" attempt to save Jake because it's across the border in cartel territory - a cartel the U.S. government has secret deals with. Instead, our government chooses the diplomatic, ""negotiate,"" approach. This doesn't work.
Given only one opportunity to make a call and secure someone trustworthy to help the Matuteros, Jake has only one person he can trust with that call - his dad. Remembering his dad dabbled in help for law enforcement or the military way back when, Jax makes that call.
Jax is beaten, stripped, tortured and starved. When he's allowed to make calls, it's to his dad or his fiancee's, Britt, and it's always to help him get out and to do what the cartel demands, smuggle humans and whatever else they want across the American border. The contact is made between Stone and the cartel. He gets instructions and directions for pick-up and drop off locations. Stone goes to work.
Stone starts off slow and then becomes a very good smuggler. The Matuteros give a nickname to Stone, ""El Coyote"". Not only is ""El Coyote"" a good smuggler, but he cares about his ""packages"". Not leaving anyone behind to die in the scorching Arizona desert, Stone feeds and provides plenty of water to his ""packages,"" making sure they make it to their final destination, the ""drop"" or ""stash"" house.
Stone meets with the CIA, DEA and other government agencies. Each meeting is always the same: ""our hands are tied""; ""we can't help because it's south of the border; and negotiations are being held as we speak in Washington, D.C."" Stone is also informed that the government is negotiating with officials in Mexico that might be on the cartel's payroll, which makes this rescue / escape infinitely more difficult.
""El Coyote"" Stone is doing everything the Matuteros ask of him. Stone is always asking them how many more and he is told ""we'll let you know."" Stone informs the government agencies of his progress. Still, though, there is no help form the U.S. government. Sophie and Carmen pester Stone for answers and results. His answer to them is always, ""I'm working on it.""
In the meantime Jake still suffers beatings, but he is trying to escape from the horrible Mexican jail with the help of a couple American prisoners. Britt presses Stone for answers about the whereabouts of her fiancee's. ""Please help, is there anything I can do,"" she asks? ""I can go down there with you. I am pretty, and the cartel will see me and maybe we can make a deal,"" she pleads. Of course, that's a ""no go"" with Stone.
After the relentless requests by the cartel to Stone for more runs, ""El Coyote"" has had it! It's time to take them down and bring his tortured son home.
Stone makes his move, having a talent for operating and killing quickly. He also incorporates the newest technology, including drones, cameras and tracking devices. One-by-one he takes out his targets. First he takes out the cartels members he's been forced to smuggle into the U.S. Then he follows the cartel members he meets at the pick-up locations and disposes of them. Previously digging several, large graves in the desert and after the kills, he buries and completely conceals them.
With the operation getting more complicated and larger, Stone realizes he needs just a little ""extra help."" With one call to his ""friends"" in New York, 8 Bonanno buddies arrive in the desert to help. [Now we have the Soprano feel to this series.] ""The Italian Mob against the Mexican Cartel."" Who will win? Stone and his buddies take out all the high-ranking members and their ""hangers on"" with one swift motion - something we don't see very often. This is the Italian way, a combination of guns, explosions, new technology and some old-fashioned shots to the back of the heads.
Stone comes home a silent hero with his first born, ""Jax."" Throughout his high intensity ordeal, we discover what a huge heart Stone has, exemplified by the love for his family and the way he genuinely cared for his ""packages."" We will also see a side of Stone best described as a ""Tony Soprano."" He has a couple of meaningless romantic interludes with females he brings across the border - romantic interludes no one wants to see, yet how Stone handles these women will be integral to the outcome.
The other side of Stone punishes the cartel members by breaking both their spirit and bones for what they are doing to the females, the young and weak on the trail to freedom. Stone kills one cartel member for attempting to rape a young Mexican girl before she crosses the border.
""El Coyote"" is a drama at is fullest with lots of action, loads of corruption, sex, love, revenge and politics. It is surprise after surprise with a major, cliff hanger ending to season one.
The series will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. It'll make you want to help Stone; get Jake out of Mexico; fall in love with Britt; want to help Carmen; want to destroy evil doers; discover compassion for the many immigrants stranded routinely in the Arizona desert; and hope for Stone and Sophie to get back together."

Batla House,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8869978/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In 2008, a violent shootout with terror suspects leaves one police officer struggling to hunt down the fugitives and justify the police action. This action thriller is based on the real-life incident of 'Batla House Encounter', officially known as Operation Batla House, to the silver screen. The incident took place on September 19, 2008, against Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists in Batla House locality in Jamia Nagar, Delhi.—Digital Sukoon Based on the true events wherein after a Police Encounter against dreaded Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists in Delhi's Batla House locality in Jamia Nagar in September 19, 2008, top cop Sanjeev Kumar is accused by a certain section of the media and activists that the encounter was fake.—Spandan Sinha (spandan888) ACP Sanjay Kumar (John Abraham) is informed that his team has cornered 5 university students in L-18, Batla House, who might have been involved in the 2008 serial bombings, the responsibility for which was claimed by the terrorist organization ""Indian Mujahideen"" (IM). Sanjay orders not to engage until he arrives, but a restless K.K. (Ravi Kishan) proceeds with some officers. Sanjay arrives and upon hearing the gunshots, decides to engage. The building is cleared, and K.K. is found shot down. Sanjay enters the room and there's more shooting, as a result of which 2 students end up dead, 2 escape and 1 is arrested alive. Sanjay now starts facing the heat from media and politicians who start billing the encounter as a fake one. They're joined by the whole nation in condemning the Delhi Police and everyone starts demanding justice for the students who were supposedly killed to account for the bombings. Sanjay's wife Nandita (Mrunal Thakur), a news anchor, is however unwilling to accept this and decides to stay with Sanjay, who soon becomes diagnosed with Posttraumatic stress disorder, frequently hallucinating about getting shot by the terrorists. Nandita somehow stops him whenever he becomes suicidal.Sanjay now starts looking for the 2 terrorists that escaped, and finds one of them to hiding in Nizampur. Sanjay is informed by his senior that he would be awarded for the encounter and that he must celebrate. Realizing he's not been told where to celebrate, he heads to Nizampur where he manages to find Dilshad, one of the fugitives. Everyone tries to stop Sanjay, who chases, beats up and almost arrests Dilshad, only to be cornered by the politicians and public who let him escape but without Dilshad.
After being awarded the President Medal, Sanjay begins his hunt again (His boss tells Sanjay to be smart and not return to Nizampur but to lure Dilshad out) and this time, through Dilshad's girlfriend Huma (Nora Fatehi), tricks him into coming to Nepal (after conducting surveillance on Dilshad for many weeks and knowing everything about his relationship with Huma). Dilshad is planning to leave for Dubai via Nepal (and plans to take Huma with him) and Sanjay plans to nab him in Nepal by using Huma. He knows that Huma is an illegal Russian immigrant and threatens to deport her, unless she delivers Dilshad to him.Huma tells Sanjay how Dilshad is expecting a call from Dubai. So Sanjay gets his colleague to call (pretending to be from Dubai) instead and give instructions for pickup in Nepal.
He teams up with his officers once again, and sends a van to pick up Dilshad, as a part of his plan. The latter, however, sends someone else to check for anything suspicious. Sanjay runs to stop his officers from engaging upon realizing Dilshad's not in the van and lets it flee. Learning of nothing suspicious, Dilshad informs the van driver he'd depart the next day, and upon landing in Nepal, is stopped, thrashed and arrested by Sanjay and his team.The court proceedings begin, where the opposing lawyer (Rajesh Sharma) brings up arguments to counter Sanjay's truth and creates a fake encounter story, as per which K.K. and his men brought the students in L18, tortured and decided to kill them when they were ordered not to do so, following which K.K. was shot by one of his officers. The lawyer also proves that nobody except the dead KK actually saw Dilshad escape from the apartment where the shootout took place.
Sanjay, however, brings out the truth that actually his officers had been closely watching the students and realized they belonged to the Indian Mujahideen. The real shootout then plays out, showcasing K.K. and his team engaging when the students fire, and the very fact that K.K. died gives Sanjay's argument a strong support when he tells everyone that no officer has ever died in a fake encounter. His arguments convince the court to sentence the 2 terrorists to life imprisonment, while the last one somehow escapes the country.While sections of the media still oppose the ruling and believe the police to be culprits, a video clip that surfaced in 2016 featured a confession from the terrorist who had escaped the encounter, about he managed to do so and later join the ISIS, further confirming the credibility of the encounter."

The Lighthouse,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7984734/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Two lighthouse keepers try to maintain their sanity while living on a remote and mysterious New England island in the 1890s. As the wavering cry of the foghorn fills the air, the taciturn former lumberjack, Ephraim Winslow, and the grizzled lighthouse keeper, Thomas Wake, set foot in a secluded and perpetually grey islet off the coast of late-19th-century New England. For the following four weeks of back-breaking work and unfavourable conditions, the tight-lipped men will have no one else for company except for each other, forced to endure irritating idiosyncrasies, bottled-up resentment, and burgeoning hatred. Then, amid bad omens, a furious and unending squall maroons the pale beacon's keepers in the already inhospitable volcanic rock, paving the way for a prolonged period of feral hunger; excruciating agony; manic isolation, and horrible booze-addled visions. Now, the eerie stranglehold of insanity tightens. Is there an escape from the wall-less prison of the mind?—Nick Riganas In the late 1800s, retired timber-man Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) is sent on a boat to serve a contract job as a wickie for four weeks on an isolated island with a gassy elderly man named Thomas Wake (William Dafoe). On the first day of the job, Winslow notices that there is a hole in his cot. As he digs into it, he finds a small wooden figurine of a mermaid and stuffs it in his jacket. Wake is perceived by Winslow as a strange and superstitious fellow, going up to the top of the lighthouse at night and stripping nude. Winslow decides to shrug it off but is drawn towards the ocean. He sees floating tree stumps in the water along with a horrifying image of a mermaid in the deep. Then he wakes, revealing this to be a dream.Over the course of his stay, Winslow is allocated the more taxing jobs, refueling the light, stirring the oil barrack, carrying heavy gasoline containers, and disposing of the two men's chamber pots. As the weeks progress, Winslow becomes more and more curious as to Wake's obsession with the light. He constantly is encountered by a strange seagull that constantly seeks to annoy Winslow at every turn. Wake sees this and encourages Winslow at dinner to leave it alone because it's bad luck to kill a seagull. The weeks continue, and Winslow constantly retreats to the supply cabin to masturbate to the figurine of the mermaid, and like clockwork, he sees Wake up on the top level of the lighthouse bare naked. One night at dinner, the two decide to get to know each other. They finally introduce each other by name and discuss the previous wickie. Wake says that his previous keeper passed away shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow tells Wake about how he used to work up in the North but decided to change profession, and Wake asks if he was running away from something he did on the mainland, which Winslow quickly shrugs off. Winslow asks Wake why killing a seagull is a bad omen, and he explains that Seagulls are vessels for the souls of dead seamen, which Winslow also shrugs off.The day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices a major jam in the oil barrack and goes to see what the fuss is about. He opens the chamber to see a dying seagull stuck inside. The other seagull who has been tormenting Winslow for the past month flies down to the oil barrack and attacks him. Winslow grabs the seagull and violently beats it to death against a rock. That afternoon, the winds finally stop, and Wake becomes paranoid that a storm is destined to attack the island, and therefore proposes that the two of them drown their sorrows in alcohol before the ferry comes tomorrow. They board up the windows, and the storm begins. As the night progresses and the two get drunker and drunker, Winslow asks to go up to the top level of the lighthouse, which leads to an argument between him and Wake. The next morning, the ferry is nowhere to be seen, and Winslow decides to continue with his morning routine. This is, however, cut short by a mysterious figure washing up on the shore. Winslow approaches the body, which appears to be a naked woman until he looks down and realizes that she is actually a mermaid. He runs back into the cottage to find Wake stating that the rations were impacted by the storm. Wake informs Winslow that they buried a secret stash of rations next to the lighthouse that they will need to get. The two dig up the giant crate, but it is revealed to only have more alcohol.Wake says it will likely take a longer time for the ferry to get here due to the storm. More nights progress and the two become closer as they drink more and continue to be at each other's throats. One night in the bedroom, Winslow, in a drunken stupor, harasses Wake and criticizes his cooking skills, leading Wake to verbally curse out Winslow, asking Neptune to strike him dead in a lengthy soliloquy. The days of the storm continue, and Winslow slowly begins to drink on his own, and he loses his composure and his concept of time. He sneaks up to the top level of the lighthouse but cannot enter without a key. As he gazes into the light, he begins to have visions of tentacles moving inside. Wake begins to psychologically manipulate Winslow until he reveals that his name is actually not Ephraim Winslow. He actually murdered a timber-man by that name and assumed his identity. Wake accuses Winslow of ""spilling his beans,"" and later on, Winslow drunkenly breaks the mermaid figurine in half. Winslow has another vision of him pulling up a lobster cage from the depths of the sea, containing the severed head of Wake's previous Wickie. Eventually, Winslow can't take anymore and tries to kill Wake in his sleep to steal the key. This proves unsuccessful, and Winslow tries to leave. He pushes the lifeboat out of the cabin, but Wake sees this and uses an ax to destroy the boat. Wake chases Winslow into the cottage, but inside, Wake continues with more psychological manipulation, claiming that it was actually Winslow that chased Wake around the island with the ax. An undisclosed amount of time later, the two have another drunken party together, until the storm becomes so powerful that the waves crash through the windows and destroying the cottage.The next morning the two wakes in a flooded cottage and Winslow decides to pick up Wake's diary. Inside, he finds that Wake has decided not to pay Winslow for his services once the ferry comes to pick them up, leading to another argument. Wake finally reveals that he knows Winslow killed the seagull and brought bad omens upon the island. Winslow attacks Wake and starts envisioning him as different people: first as the real Ephraim Winslow, then as the mermaid, then as Poseidon himself. Enveloped in imaginary tentacles, he beats Wake into submission. He then ties a collar around Wake's neck and forces him to walk and act like a dog. He takes Wake over to the hole where they kept the crate of alcohol and covers Wake in the dirt until he passes out. Winslow uses this opportunity to steal the key off him and runs back into the cottage to find the cabinet. Wake, in a fit of rage, bursts into the cottage with the ax and hacks Winslow in the shoulder. Winslow overpowers Wake and impales Wake right in the head. Winslow then walks up to the top level of the lighthouse and finally sees what is inside the light. He is then overpowered by the brightness and begins to maniacally laugh until he slips and falls down the stairs all the way to the floor. The film ends with a final shot of Winslow lying naked on the rocks, seagulls picking at his insides."

Official Secrets,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5431890/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The true story of a British whistleblower who leaked information to the press about an illegal NSA spy operation designed to push the UN Security Council into sanctioning the 2003 invasion of Iraq. A morality tale for the 21st century, Official Secrets tells the true story of British Intelligence whistle-blower Katharine Gun who, during the immediate run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion, leaked a top secret NSA memo exposing a joint US-UK illegal spying operation against members of the UN Security Council. The memo proposed blackmailing smaller, undecided member states into voting for war. At great personal and professional risk, journalist Martin Bright published the leaked document in The Observer newspaper in London, and the story made headlines around the world. Members of the Security Council were outraged and any chance of a UN resolution in favour of war collapsed. But within days, Bush declared he no longer needed UN backing and invaded anyway. As Iraq descended into chaos, Katharine was arrested and charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act. Martin faced potential charges too. Their legal battles exposed the highest levels of government in both London and Washington with having manipulated intelligence in order to sell an illegal war. In early 2003, GCHQ analyst Katharine Gun obtains a memo detailing a joint United States and British operation to spy on diplomats from several non-permanent United Nations Security Council member states Cameroon, Chile, Bulgaria and Guinea in order to ""dig dirt"" on them and influence the Security Council into passing a resolution supporting an invasion of Iraq. Angered that the United Kingdom is being led into a war on false pretenses, Katharine leaks the memo to a friend involved in the anti-war movement, who passes it to anti-war activist Yvonne Ridley, who in turn passes it to The Observer journalist Martin Bright.The Observer foreign editor Peter Beaumont allows Martin to investigate the story in the interest of journalism. To verify the authenticity of the leaked memo, Martin enlists the help of the Observer's Washington, DC correspondent Ed Vulliamy in contacting the memo's author Frank Koza, the Chief of Staff at the ""regional targets"" section of the National Security Agency. Despite the Observer's pro-war stance, Peter convinces the newspaper's editor Roger Alton that the leaked memo is worth publishing.The publication of the leaked memo in March 2003 generates considerable public and media interest. The Drudge Report attempts to discredit the document as a fake after a young staffer named Nicole Mowbray inadvertently changed the text from American to British English using spell check. However, Martin is able to produce the original memo, confirming its authenticity. Katharine's actions prompt GCHQ to launch an internal investigation. Seeking to prevent an invasion of Iraq and to protect her fellow GCHQ colleagues from prolonged suspicion, Katharine confesses to leaking the memo. She is arrested and detained for a night before being released on remand.Following the outbreak of the Iraq War, Katharine seeks the services of the Liberty lawyers Ben Emmerson and Shami Chakrabarti. The British Government decides to charge her with violating the Official Secrets Act, tasking Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald with leading the prosecution. To exert pressure on her, the British authorities attempt to deport her husband Yasar Gun, a Turkish Kurd. However, Katharine is able to halt the deportation by presenting a marriage certificate proving the authenticity of her relationship.Ben comes up with the defense strategy that Katharine was acting out of loyalty to her country by seeking to prevent the UK from being led into an unlawful war in Iraq. With the help of Martin, Ed, and former Foreign Office deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst, Ben discovers that the Attorney General Peter Goldsmith changed his position on the legality of the Iraq War after meeting with several lawyers from the Bush Administration. Despite the odds stacked against them, Katharine refuses to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced charge.On the day of the trial, the Crown prosecutor drops all charges against Katharine. Ben suggests to the court that this is because prosecuting her would have shown that the Blair government led the UK into war on false pretenses. The film then mentions the human toll of the Iraq War and that Lord Goldsmith's advice on the illegality of the Iraq War was made public in 2010. The film ends with footage of Katharine addressing the media following the dismissal of her case and Ben shunning Ken for putting Katharine through the ordeal ""to make an example of her""."

Bombshell,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6394270/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A group of women take on Fox News headRoger Ailesand the toxic atmosphere he presided over at the network. WhenGretchen Carlsonslaps Fox News founderRoger Aileswith a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, not a soul could predict what would happen next. Her decision leads to Fox News correspondentMegyn Kellycoming forward with her own story, as well as multiple other women, inciting a movement that reverberates around the world.—Jwelch5742 Against the backdrop of the 2016 United States presidential election, Fox News' anchor,Megyn Kelly, finds herself embroiled in controversy, after questioning the Republican front runner,Donald Trump, on his misogynistic comments. But, on July 6, 2016--as the network's former anchorwoman,Gretchen Carlson, sets in motion a maelstrom of events for refusing to exchange sexual favours with Fox News mogul,Roger Ailes--other journalists, like the ambitious producer, Kayla Pospisil, come forward. Now, three wronged women are about to reveal the toxic world of sexual harassment in a workplace environment, bent on bringing down the powerful CEO. However, are Megyn, Gretchen, and Kayla the only ones who didn't get along with the boys?—Nick Riganas Focusing on three women - two real life and one fictitious (arguably a composite of many real life women) - the toxic work environment at Fox News for females at the hands of the network's PresidentRoger Ailesis dramatized, specifically the period in early to mid 2016.Megyn Kellyhas made it to where many aspire, namely hosting her own prime time show on the network, as well as being given the plum assignments, such as being one of the moderators of the GOP's presidential candidates debate. Unlike most right wing journalists, she decides to confront candidateDonald Trumpabout his poor public treatment of women, especially the denigrating name calling, such action by Kelly which does not sit well with the staunchest of his supporters.Gretchen Carlsonwas once at Kelly's position with the network, but she is seeing her star fading given a dead on-air time slot, that demotion largely from her outspoken stance on many issues. She, in the process, receives Ailes' ire in not presenting herself as eye candy as is the unofficial expectation of all women at the network, on air personalities or otherwise. Seeing the writing on the wall, she takes preemptive steps to protect her future. Kayla Pospisil, an avowed evangelical, has always wanted to work for Fox, and aspires to being an on-air personality. In taking proactive steps to reach that goal, she attracts the attention of Ailes. A major incident occurs at the network in that Carlson is ultimately fired, which prompts her to enact those steps she was working on: she sues Ailes himself for sexual misconduct, unlike previous suits by others before her suing the network unsuccessfully. Factoring the fear that exists among many female employees that are aware of Ailes' actions toward them as a collective, Kelly and Pospisil have to decide if they will come forward publicly to divulge their own experiences of Ailes' inappropriate behavior toward them - Kelly's ten years prior, Pospisil's current - at the possible risk to their careers where Ailes and the network have not tolerated anything but unconditional loyalty.—Huggo In 2016, Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) is the chairman of Fox News, and runs the network from the second floor of the building with an iron fist. The story interweaves the stories of three different women who work at Fox News.Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), one of the network's biggest stars, prepares to moderate a debate of the Republican candidates for president. Despite some push-back from colleagues, she is determined to ask Trump about his sexist comments towards women. The day of the debate, she gets extremely sick, vomiting in the bathroom. She goes on anyway and asks him about his comments. He spends the evening tweeting viciously about her, inciting his followers to attack her as well. Megyn is distressed at the amount of hate she receives and about the fact that she has become the story instead of reporting it.During her time off, she gets rude comments made to her and a paparazzo appears outside her window, taking pictures of her daughter, forcing her husband Douglas (Mark Duplass) to get rid of him. When she returns to work, while Fox hires a security detail, the network is not going to come out against Trump. Roger, who is close with Megyn, is notoriously paranoid, and believes that Megyn was poisoned the day of the debate.Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), was the co-host of Fox and Friends, but was removed from that spot and given a less valuable afternoon one. After enduring sexist comment after sexist comment (often on the air), she is tired of it. She meets with attorneys who tell her that her contract makes it tough for her to fight back in any way - they tell her the story of Rudi Bakhitar (Nazanin Boniadi) who was fired after not accepting her boss's sexual advances. They tell her the workaround would be to sue Roger directly, but she'd need to have hard evidence, and other women would need to come forward - Gretchen is certain other women will, and returns to work.Kayla Popisil (Margot Robbie) is a young conservative woman raised in a religious home who worships the right-wing and conservative Fox News network. She has begun her career there working under Gretchen, until she is offered a promotion to Bill O'Reilly's show, the network's biggest program. On one of her shows, Gretchen wears no makeup to show and support women, and Roger storms down to the studio and makes a vicious comment about her appearance, which Kayla hears. She then tells Gretchen she's leaving - Gretchen wants her to stay, and tells her she can protect her, but Kayla doesn't see why she should turn down a promotion. She moves to O'Reilly and gets chewed out by him during her first day. Kayla's co-worker, Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), helps her out by showing her how to make Fox News stories, ""terrify your grandmother, outrage your grandfather.""One day after a round of work drinks, Kayla and Jess sleep together, though Kayla tells Jess she isn't a lesbian. She is shocked to find a Hilary poster in Jess's apartment, and wants to know why a gay Hilary supporter works at Fox. Jess explains she applied to many jobs but this was the one that stuck, and now no one else will hire her because she works at Fox.At work, Kayla tells Jess to hide a photo she has with another woman. Kayla is invited to Roger's office to meet with him, and she's excited at the idea of being promoted to on air talent. She tells him this, and he asks her to get up and do a twirl for him. He then asks to see more of her legs. He keeps doing this until she, extremely uncomfortable, pulls her skirt up high enough that he can see her underwear. He dismisses her, and she tries to tell Jess about it, but Jess sadly tells her she can't be involved.Time passes, and Megyn goes to interview Donald Trump at Trump Tower. When she reviews the footage, Douglas is angry that it seems like she let him off the hook with barely a slap on the wrist. Meanwhile, Gretchen does a story on her show where she tells the audience that she supports a ban an assault weapons, and is asked to come to the second floor. All three women end up in the elevator at the same time, as Kayla is sent up to Roger's office, and Gretchen meets with executives who fire her. She wants to know why, but isn't given a reason. Gretchen files suit against Roger, which sends the Fox offices into high alert. Roger meets with his wife Beth (Connie Britton), attorney Susan Estrich (Allison Janney), and Rudy Giuliani (Richard Kind), and denies all the claims.Fox tells all of their female talent to come out and support Roger, which many of them do happily, saying they were never harassed. Megyn is silent, and she tells her staff the truth - because Roger harassed her when she began at the network. Her second-in-command, Gil (Rob Delaney) wants to know what she wants to do - she tells him she just spent all that time being the news, and she doesn't want to insert herself into this just yet. Fox, however, keeps pressuring Megyn to make a statement in support of Roger.In the initial aftermath of the suit, not one other woman comes forward, deeply disappointing Gretchen, who had really believed other women would speak out. Investigators do find six women who were horrifically sexually harassed by Roger, but before Fox News, which isn't helpful to Gretchen's suit or public perception. Megyn considers coming forward, but does not want to be the only one, and begins hunting for the other women, despite the danger of doing so at Fox.She eventually follows a few leads herself and finds multiple women who have been harassed or assaulted by Roger, Bill O'Reilly, and other men at the network and convinces them to go to the investigators. She meets with Kayla, who she is asks if Roger harassed her. Kayla admits he did, and Megyn tells her it happened to her. Kayla is angry, wanting to know why she did nothing to protect women after her and why she isn't doing anything now. Megyn tells Kayla it isn't her job to protect her and to report the harassment.While on a date with a man, Kayla calls Jess, crying, asking if she gave Megyn her name. Jess tells her she was worried about her, and Kayla tells her through tears that she gave into Roger. Jess is sorry, and when Kayla tells her she thinks she wants to go to the investigators, she encourages her to do so. Megyn finally comes forward, which is a massive nail in Roger's coffin. When she is interviewed by the investigators, she sees her name is ""Witness W"", and realizes that 23 women have come forward. Susan tells Roger that Gretchen recorded all of their meetings, and has proof of everything in the suit. He asks why they didn't say anything before, and Susan tells Roger they wanted him to deny everything only to prove he was lying.Roger meets with Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell), his longtime friend and owner of Fox News, and the term's of Roger's exit are settled. Roger asks to go to the newsroom to tell everyone, but Rupert says no. Megyn is at the Republican National Convention when she is informed that Roger is out. Kayla, happy that Roger is gone, takes Jess's photo out of her drawer and encourages her to keep it out - Jess hides it anyway once Murdoch enters the newsroom where he gives a speech to them them that Roger is gone and he will be taking over. Kayla, realizing she is done with Fox News, walks out, tossing her badge into the trash as Jess watches her go, happy for her.Gretchen gets a settlement offer of twenty million dollars and an apology from Fox News, which she can't believe she got. She tells the audience she doesn't care if they like her, she just cares that they believe her. Her attorneys tell her that along with the settlement comes a non-disclosure, which means she can never tell her story. Gretchen looks out into the audience and says, ""maybe""."

The Platform,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8228288/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A vertical prison with one cell per level. Two people per cell. Only one food platform and two minutes per day to feed. An endless nightmare trapped in The Hole. A mysterious place, an indescribable prison, a deep hole. An unknown number of levels. Two inmates living on each level. A descending platform containing food for all of them. An inhuman fight for survival, but also an opportunity for solidarity.—yusufpiskin In a dystopian near future with absence of resources, people can freely to go into The Hole, a vertical underground jail where after an interview to check the possible admission, the volunteer passes a determined time in exchange to acquire more social status. Hoping to get an approved title, Goreng wakes up in the level 48 to discover The Hole's structure: only one cell of 6 meters height (so-so 20 feet) per level with a rectangular hole in the middle in all them, used by The Hole's administration to descend a too rectangular floating platform with the food for all prisoners, downing from level 0 (the restaurant in the surface where food is cooked) to the bottom, standing 2 minutes per level. With veteran Trimagasi as cell's partner, Goreng learns eventually The Hole's main rules: 1st, each inmate arrives The Hole with a personal object to chose from the exterior; 2nd, the inmates can't keep food off the platform under penalty to die by extreme heat or cold; and 3rd, one time per month all inmates are asleep using gas in order to exchange all them of level. But when a month later they both wake up in the level 171, Goreng learns for his horror that all the inmates divide in four types: those in the upper levels who eat with more time to think, those in the mid levels who eat the rests of the food left in the platform, those in the lower levels whose don't eat after platform arrives empty becoming in demented and starved killers, and finally those who jump to the void by the hole, crashing against lower levels to being cannibalized by the savage inmates. Saved to be killed by Trimagasi in the last minute by Miharu, a silent and violent young girl who time and time again descends in the platform looking for her missing child forced to be in The Hole, Goreng starts lose his mind in a place without morality or humanity, passing from level 23 to 252 with Imoguiri (Goreng's interviewer and an ingenuous about the reality of The Hole) as new partner to finally arrive in level 6 with Baharat as lately partner, who tries with a rope scaling to level 0. But Goreng tells Baharat a better plan to leave The Hole.—CHockys Goreng wakes up in part of The Hole, a place where food is sent down with The Platform. As people above become selfish and eat whatever they want, people below get less. Goreng learns from the other cellmates that the people below can fall into madness and sanity loss turning into bloody cannibalism, so he starts to get into a plan for The Hole's people.—baxyofh4rd The film begins with a scene of a gourmet meal being expertly prepared, while a voiceover states that there are three types of people - the ones above, the ones below, and the ones who fall.A young man named Goreng awakens in a concrete prison cell where he is greeted by an older man named Trimagasi. Trimagasi tells him that they are on level 48 and that they are in ""the pit."" Trimagasi wonders what their food will be - when Goreng asks him to elaborate, Trimagasi states that it will be whatever the ones above leave behind. Goreng looks through a rectangular hole in the bottom of the cell, revealing countless identical cells below theirs - he sees the same when he looks above. When Goreng asks how the pit works, Trimagasi simply tells him that ""they eat,"" and that while it is either easy or difficult to do so depending on where you've been assigned, 48 is not that bad of a level. Goreng asks him how many levels are below them, and Trimagasi says there are not many, but that soon there will be less. Goreng calls out to the ones below them, but Trimagasi instructs him not to, and says that the ones above won't answer either. Goreng says he has been in the pit for many months, and that they will only remain at level 48 for exactly a month. A platform containing scraps of food then lowers itself through the hole in the ceiling, stopping once it reaches them. Trimagasi begins to eat hungrily. Goreng refuses to eat, disgusted at the thought of having to feast on food that 94 others have already eaten, but finds a perfectly intact apple and tucks it into his pocket, intending to save it for later. After the platform descends, Goreng points out that the room is growing hotter. Trimagasi says that the temperature in the room will continue to rise until they boil alive unless Goreng returns the apple he stole, and that the punishment for attempting to keep any of the food is being burned or frozen to death. Goreng throws the apple back, and the temperature returns to normal.Goreng offers to tell Trimagasi why he is in the pit in exchange for Trimagasi's own story. He explains that he plans on quitting smoking and that he brought a copy of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote to read - as all inmates are allowed to choose one personal item to bring into the pit with them - leading Trimagasi to question if Goreng admitted himself to the pit voluntarily. Goreng reveals that he agreed to remain in the pit for 6 months in exchange for an accredited diploma. Trimagasi reveals that he is spending a year in the pit, offended at the fact that he is not receiving a degree. The next day, Trimagasi tells his own story; he purchased a ""Samurai Max,"" a highly efficient knife sharpener that he had seen in a television ad, before then seeing an ad for the ""Samurai Plus,"" a self-sharpening knife. In his frustration at having wasted his money on the Samurai Max, he threw his TV out his window, crushing and killing a man who was passing by. Trimagasi appears to show no remorse for this on account that the man was an illegal immigrant and therefore shouldn't have been there in the first place. Trimagasi then confides that he doesn't know exactly how many levels there are but that there are definitely at least 132, having stayed on level 132 before and claiming that no food reaches such low levels. Goreng doesn't believe Trimagasi could have possibly survived for a month without food, but Trimagasi claims he was still able to eat in spite of the platform containing no food. Goreng wants to try to convince the ones above to ration the food, but Trimagasi says it's fruitless. Goreng then tries to pass the message to those below, but Trimagasi unzips his pants and urinates on them as Goreng watches in disgust. Goreng shows Trimagasi his copy of Don Quixote before asking what personal item Trimagasi chose - Trimagasi reveals that he brought a Samurai Plus.The next day, a body falls through the hole, much to the horror of Goreng, while Trimagasi appears wholly unfazed. Goreng yells to the other cells, asking why nobody is reacting to the body; he is met with no response. It is then that Goreng concludes that Trimagasi cannibalized his cellmate. Just then, the platform arrives, carrying a bruised, bloodied Asian woman named Miharu. While Goreng is concerned for her, Trimagasi tells him not to worry, explaining that Miharu descends the pit every month in search of her son. Trimagasi also explains that each month, Miharu kills her cellmate so that she may have a higher chance of being paired with her son during the next month's cell rotation, and that the body that fell earlier was likely Miharu's cellmate, having been pushed by her. The platform descends and Miharu is attacked by the prisoners on level 49 - Goreng screams for them to stop, but is ignored. Trimagasi tells him not to interfere since ""they'll only keep her for a few days."" Miharu kills the two men in self-defense and returns to the platform, looking up at Trimagasi and Goreng emotionlessly before continuing her descent downward. Goreng begins reading Don Quixote to Trimagasi once Miharu is gone, beginning at chapter one. The two men become friends over the following month.One night, Trimagasi asks Goreng if he believes in God. Goreng doesn't answer, but Trimagasi asks Goreng to pray for them, explaining that the room is being filled with gas that will put them to sleep and when they wake up, they will be in a different cell. Trimagasi explains that this is his second to last month in the pit, that he doesn't think Goreng will survive much longer, and that he believes he deserves a degree for his time spent in the pit. Goreng asks him the same question Trimagasi had asked him earlier to which Trimagasi answers, ""this month, I believe.""When Goreng awakens, he is bound and gagged in his bed. Trimagasi appears and it is revealed that the two have been reassigned to level 171. While Trimagasi explains that hunger will drive a person insane and that Goreng's meat is more desirable since he is younger than Trimagasi, he admits that he is reluctant to kill Goreng and plans to spare his life for at least a week. Screams can be heard from above them - the screams of their fellow prisoners having discovered what levels they have been reassigned to. Several bodies fall past them through the hole. He removes Goreng's gag, who begins begging for his life, but Trimagasi says their friendship was never meant to last. The platform arrives in their room, holding nothing but empty plates, which Trimagasi throws in frustration. He explains that after eight days, he will begin cutting strips of flesh from Goreng, tending to the wounds each time so that Goreng doesn't bleed to death. Goreng tells Trimagasi that although the death of the immigrant may have been accidental, Goreng's death won't be and Trimagasi will be responsible for it, but Trimagasi retorts that ""the ones above"" will be the ones responsible.For the next eight days, Trimagasi keeps Goreng bound while the latter tries to escape to no avail. On the eighth day, Trimagasi tells Goreng that the time has come for him to begin consuming his cellmate. Goreng has become too exhausted to resist, and solemnly tells Trimagasi that he will hold him solely responsible for his death; not the circumstances, nor the inmates above them. Trimagasi successfully cuts a slice from Goreng's leg only to be stopped by Miharu as she rides down the platform. Miharu knocks Trimagasi out with a wine bottle and uses his Samurai Plus to slit his throat before freeing Goreng, who fatally stabs him. Goreng passes out and wakes up to the sight of Miharu cutting into Trimagasi's flesh, which she uses to feed both herself and Goreng. Before she continues her ride downward, Goreng asks her what her son's name is; she doesn't respond. Over the next month, Goreng continues to sustain himself using Trimagasi's body, experiencing a hallucination of Trimagasi. The apparition taunts him for the lack of respect and sympathy Goreng showed him, claiming that while they are now both murderers, Trimagasi is the more civilized of the two. As Goreng is gassed at the end of the month, he dreams of a sexual encounter with Miharu.The next morning, he is awoken by a dachshund puppy and discovers that he is on level 33. The dog is named Ramesses II and belongs to a woman named Imougiri, his new cellmate. Imougiri says she would have never come into the pit without Ramesses, while Goreng scoffs and says that bringing a dog into the pit was a poor choice, as he will inevitably end up dead. Imougiri then mocks him for his own decision to bring a book, and calls him by his name, leading him to question how she knows him. She doesn't answer, only telling him he may smoke if desired, whereupon he suddenly recognizes her. A flashback scene reveals Goreng, prior to his admission, being interviewed by Imougiri about any allergies or dietary restrictions he may have. It is revealed that he was smoking during the interview; Imougiri firmly told him he would not be allowed to smoke once he was admitted. She subsequently asked him what his favorite food was; though initially confused about why he was being asked this, once Imougiri ominously explained that it would be ""added to the menu,"" Goreng answered escargot a la bourguignonne (snails with garlic butter).Back in the present, Goreng asks if Imougiri is here to free him; she says she can't, and that much like him, she came to the pit voluntarily. Goreng tells her that people die in the pit every day, which Imougiri responds is actually called a ""Vertical Self-Management Center."" Goreng asks how many levels there are, to which she responds there are two hundred. Goreng says there is not enough food for two hundred levels, but Imougiri asserts that if everyone ate only what they needed, the food would reach the lowest level. The platform arrives in their cell. While Goreng eats, Imougiri prepares two plates and then feeds Ramesses, explaining that she plans to ration her food by feeding her dog one day and herself the next. Goreng tells her that she may inadvertently cause the death of a child; Imougiri seems confused, explaining that no children under 16 are permitted into the pit. Goreng says that at least one child is in the pit, but Imougiri insists that there are absolutely no exceptions to this rule.The platform descends and Imougiri tells the people below them that she has prepared plates for them. She urges them to only eat what's on the plate, then prepare similar plates for the ones below and tell them to do the same. The men on level 34 aggressively explain that they have just come from level 88 and are practically starving; when Imougiri tells them they have a responsibility to take care of those who have been less fortunate than them this month, they angrily cuss at her and begin to eat as much as they can off the platform out of spite. Goreng tells Imougiri that if the prisoners were reasonable enough to ration their food, the Administration would know how to prevent this from happening in the outside world. Imougiri asks Goreng if he thinks everything the Administration does is bad, revealing that she has been working for them for 25 years. Goreng retorts that she receives special privileges because of this, having had the liberty to choose her own cellmate, unlike him.Each day, Imougiri continues to try and reason with those below her, only for her requests to go ignored each time. On the fifteenth day, the men are angrily confronted by Goreng, who promises that if they do not follow Imougiri's instructions, he will defecate on their food for the remainder of the month. Imougiri says she wanted to convince the ones below rather than fear-monger them, but Goreng insists it was the only way. Imougiri tries to convince the ones above but Goreng says they won't listen because he can't defecate upwards, therefore he has nothing to successfully threaten them with. The next day Miharu arrives on the platform, severely injured and barely conscious. As they tend to her injuries, the platform descends, and Miharu speaks for the first time in the film, only stating ""it's cold."" Goreng realizes that the temperature in the room is being lowered with the intent of freezing them to death; Imougiri's dog Ramesses has kept a scrap of meat. He fights the dog for the scrap and the temperature returns to normal. Miharu stays in their cell and in the middle of the night, Goreng awakens to a violent confrontation between the two women. He breaks up the fight and as a distressed Imougiri bursts into tears, he discovers that Miharu has killed Ramesses.The next day, Miharu rides the platform down once again. Goreng tells Imougiri about Miharu's search for her son; Imougiri says she wouldn't understand what Miharu is going through, since Imougiri does not have any children of her own. Goreng watches as Miharu stabs the men in the cell below them while Imougiri recalls her interview with Miharu 10 months ago, relaying that Miharu came to the pit alone. She also reveals that Miharu is an actress, that she is an orphan, she has no children, and her personal item is a ukulele. She makes racist comments about Miharu and ridicules Goreng for his decision to bring a book before revealing to him that she has been sending people to the pit for eight years, promising that she was unaware of the inhumane conditions. She takes off her shirt to expose cancerous scars across her chest, confiding that she fought the disease for three years and came to the pit to fix the system once she discovered that her diagnosis was terminal.The next day, the platform arrives with an untouched plate of escargot a la bourguignonne. Goreng is pleased by this, but places two snails on each ration plate rather than eating it all himself. When Goreng asks Imougiri why she isn't eating, she says today was supposed to be Ramesses II's day to eat. Goreng then tells her she should have something since it is the last day of the month, and they have no way of knowing what cell they'll end up in tomorrow. Goreng has the misfortune of waking up in cell 202, contradicting Imougiri's earlier claims that only two hundred cells existed, and is horrified to discover that many more cells still exist below them, and that Imougiri has hanged herself. Goreng experiences hallucinations of Trimagasi and Imougiri telling him to consume her dead body; greatly distressed by the hallucinations, he refuses, sustaining himself by eating pages from Don Quixote instead. He eventually gives in, slicing into Imougiri using the Samurai Plus that Trimagasi had left behind.The next morning, Goreng awakens and finds Miharu sleeping in the bed adjacent to his. She tries to stab him with the Samurai Plus, but Goreng wakes up screaming, revealing this encounter to be a dream. Goreng discovers that he is now in cell number 6, and that his new cellmate is a religious black man named Baharat who has been trying to escape the pit for a while and is now fully convinced he will be able to. Baharat tells the man and woman above them - a couple - that God spoke to him and instructed him to escape the pit, alluding to two ""compassionate"" individuals aiding him and being rewarded with eternal life for doing so. They agree to help him; Baharat tosses his rope up to them, and as he begins climbing, the woman defecates on his face. The stupefied Baharat drops his rope down all the remaining levels and nearly falls into the hole himself, but is saved by Goreng. Despite the platform being nearly full with food as it arrives in their cell, Baharat doesn't eat. The two men listen as the couple on level 5 have sex.Goreng is once again visited by an apparition of Trimagasi that night, who congratulates him on having only one month left before he is freed from the pit. Goreng convinces Baharat to ride the platform with him to convince the other prisoners to ration their food, promising to make weapons to defend themselves against rogue or belligerent prisoners who attack them. Goreng estimates that there are about 250 levels altogether. Baharat asks what they should do in the event that they run out of food before reaching the lowest level; Goreng says they will simply ride the platform back up. Baharat is initially reluctant to do so, not wanting to leave a level so close to the top, but quickly agrees.The next day, the two men begin their descent in spite of being ridiculed by the couple on level 5. Goreng says that they will only start giving out the food once they reach level 51, since the people on the first 50 levels get to eat every day. One of the men on level 7, who helped Baharat climb a few months before, begs them to let him eat since he was on level 114 the previous month, but Goreng is unsympathetic to his plight. The man makes racist comments towards Baharat before attempting to forcefully take a piece of food off the platform; an angry Baharat bludgeons him to death. From that point forward, the two adamantly defend the food from the prisoners on the first 50 levels. On one of the levels, they meet Sr. Brambang, a man in a wheelchair who appears to have a history with Baharat. Brambang tells them that civility and discussion is more effective than violence, then says that their quest to ""break the system"" will be meaningless if the Administration doesn't realize what they have done. He then suggests that they leave a ""beautifully prepared"" plate of panna cotta fully intact, and send it all the way back up to level 0 as a ""message"" for the Administration. The two passionately guard the panna cotta, making sure it remains untouched, and start rationing food once they reach level 51, attacking prisoners who try to take more than what they are allotted.As they approach level 250, they come across the corpse of a man; Goreng reasons that this was the cell Miharu woke up in. The platform continues its descent, forcing the men to realize that there are more than just 250 levels. The platform does not stop at any of the following levels; Baharat concludes that if there's nobody alive in a cell, the platform will not stop at that level. They hear Miharu's screams and discover that she is being attacked by two other inmates. Baharat and Goreng jump off the platform and violently confront the men. Miharu is fatally stabbed; Goreng briefly mourns over her corpse, but is dragged away by Baharat as the platform is leaving. Though both men are injured and visibly traumatized, they continue their descent, with no food remaining on the platform aside from the still completely untouched panna cotta. The platform finally stops at level 333; Baharat assumes that they have reached the last level, and tells Goreng to prepare himself for the ascension upwards. It's then that Goreng notices a little girl hiding under the bed. They get off the platform, but it continues downward before they can get back on. Goreng instructs Baharat, who is still holding the panna cotta, to toss it back onto the platform, but he refuses. As the platform gets further and further away from them, both men realize that the temperature in the room hasn't changed at all. The girl slowly crawls out from under the bed, revealing that she bears a striking resemblance to Miharu; Goreng realizes that the ""son"" Miharu had been looking for is actually her daughter. Though reluctant, they feed her the panna cotta before passing out.Goreng has yet another dream about Trimagasi, who commends him for his bravery in ""squandering"" the food all the way from level 6 and asks him if he plans to eat Baharat. He then hallucinates Imougiri telling him that Ramesses II is the message, only to be shaken awake by Baharat, who tells him, ""the girl is the message."" He looks to the platform to see the girl sleeping peacefully atop it, affirming that she is ""the message"" before abruptly jolting awake, revealing this exchange to have been a dream as well. He discovers that the real Baharat has died from his injuries. Finding Miharu's daughter asleep in one of the beds, he wakes her up and brings her to the platform when it arrives. Once the platform finally arrives at the lowest level, he is once again approached by the apparition of Trimagasi, who encourages him to get off the platform and leave with him. Goreng initially declines, saying he has to ride the platform back up to level 0, but Trimagasi tells him this is unnecessary since he is not ""the message."" Goreng responds that he is the bearer, and Trimagasi says, ""the message requires no bearer."" Realizing that Trimagasi is right, Goreng gets off the platform and the two walk off together as they watch the sleeping girl ascend."
Vivarium,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368406/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young couple looking for the perfect home find themselves trapped in a mysterious labyrinth-like neighborhood of identical houses. A young couple is thinking about buying their starter home. And to this end, they visit a real estate agency where they are received by a strange sales agent, who accompanies them to a new, mysterious, peculiar housing development to show them a single-family home. There they get trapped in a surreal, maze-like nightmare.—Sitges Film Festival Aspiring to acquire their dream home, Gemma, a primary school teacher, and her boyfriend, Tom, follow Martin, a creepy real estate agent, to the idyllic suburban development called Yonder. But there, surrounded by identical, picture-perfect houses, the young couple is in for a big surprise--and it is not about the suspiciously affordable price of the pastel-coloured, eerily vacant house. Is house #9, indeed, the ideal home?—Nick Riganas The opening scene depicts the parasitic life-cycle of cuckoos before introducing Gemma (Imogen Poots), a primary school teacher, and her boyfriend Tom (Jesse Eisenberg), a handyman. They drive to meet with a real estate agent to inquire about buying a house. The agent, Martin (Jonathan Aris), is oddly off-putting. Nonetheless, they follow him to a suburban development called Yonder, filled with identical houses. There, Martin shows them around house number 9. He asks if they have children, and when Gemma replies, ""No, not yet"" he mimics her perfectly. After looking around the garden, they re-enter the house to find that Martin has vanished. They attempt to leave, but repeatedly find themselves returned to number 9. In disbelief, they drive around the endless, identical streets until they run out of gas. There is no phone signal either.Out of options, they sleep in the house. The next morning, they try to escape on foot, but consistently return to number 9. They eventually give up and find a box full of tasteless vacuum-packed food left in front of the house. In desperation, Tom sets fire to the house, and they sleep on the pavement. When they awake, another box has been left for them. This time it contains an infant, and the message, ""Raise the child and be released."" When the smoke clears, they see the house undamaged.98 days later, the infant has grown to resemble a ten-year-old boy who, like Martin, mimics Tom and Gemma. It screams bloody murder when it gets hungry and stops when it is fed. Gemma and Tom sit together in the garden with a pickax, waiting to attack whoever delivers and collects the food, but they never see anyone. Tom starts digging a hole in the garden, thinking it may lead somewhere, and becomes withdrawn. The boy secretly watches them have sex at night.
In the living room, the Boy (Senan Jennings) sits before the television, which shows bizarre, fractal-like patterns.Tom comes to believe if the Boy dies, someone might come for the body, and they could force whoever it is to free them, so he locks it in their car, intending to starve it. However, Gemma takes pity and releases it. One day the Boy goes missing and returns with a book full of strange symbols and images of humanoids with throat sacs. When Gemma asks him to mimic the person who gave him the book, he makes strange, rasping sounds and inflates his throat sacs. Gemma finally had proof that the boy is a different species, possibly alien, who use humans to raise them.Soon the Boy has matured to resemble a young adult (Eanna Hardwicke). Tom and Gemma avoid him where possible as Tom becomes sick. The Boy leaves during the day, and Gemma tries to follow him, but always finds herself back at number 9. Tom continues to dig and finds a body in a vacuum bag. The Boy locks Gemma and Tom out of the house, forcing them to sleep in the car. When Tom's condition worsens, Gemma pleads with the Boy for medicine for Tom, but he replies, ""Maybe it's time he is released."" When Tom dies in Gemma's arms, the Boy zips him into a vacuum bag and throws it into the deep hole Tom has dug.After another night locked out, Gemma ambushes the Boy with the pickax, but only manages to wound him. The creature hisses and crawls into a labyrinth under the pavement. Gemma follows it and crashes through the door into multiple rooms in other houses with more Boys and several strangers, one of whom has committed suicide.
She lands back in number 9, weak and moaning. The Boy is cleaning the house. He carries her to a vacuum bag and explains that mothers die after raising their sons. She says she is not his mother, and dies as he zips her in. The Boy buries her with Tom and fills the hole, which then disappears. After filling the car with gas, he drives back to the estate office, where an aged Martin lies dying in his chair. Martin gives his name-tag to The Boy and then expires, having finished his life-cycle. The Boy puts Martin in a vacuum bag, folds it up, and puts it into a file drawer. He sits down in the chair and waits. When another couple walks in the door, the Boy stands to greet them the same way Martin did."
Sound of Metal,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5363618/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A heavy metal drummer's life is turned upside down when he begins to lose his hearing and he must confront a future filled with silence. Keeping at bay his inner demons by devoting himself to art, metal drummer, Ruben, has been living for the moment for the past four years. Then, while on tour with his lead-singer/girlfriend, Lou, Ruben realises that his hearing is rapidly deteriorating. As this sudden hearing loss turns his world upside down, and numbing fear paired with angry denial take over, Ruben reluctantly accepts to join a small deaf community overseen by Joe, a compassionate Vietnam War veteran. Now, Ruben needs to find some solid ground, understand that being deaf is not a handicap and that deafness isn't something to fix.

He gives the children and Diane basic drumming lessons.Up to this point, Ruben's stay has been sponsored by a church. Joe offers him a more permanent way of staying on and tells him to think about it. Ruben periodically uses the computer to check in on Lou and see what she is up to, discovering her to be experimenting with her own music in Paris. He gets his friend Jenn to sell his drums, sound board, and other music equipment. Ruben then sells his RV. He uses the money to get cochlear implant surgery. Ruben asks Joe if he can stay on for 3-4 weeks until the implants activate. Joe refuses, as the foundation of the community is built on the belief that deafness is not a handicap.Once the cochlear implants are activated they allow Ruben to hear but not in a traditional sense and he has to get used to it. He is disappointed, however, to find that the implants cause irritating feedback that disrupt his attempts to regain his old way of life. Ruben flies to meet Lou at her wealthy father Richard's house in Belgium, where she has settled into a new lifestyle. Richard welcomes him and allows him to stay there. At a gathering, Lou and her father perform a duet, though Ruben's implants prevent him from enjoying it. Ruben and Lou discuss the possibility of playing music and touring again. Ruben notices this makes Lou anxious and tells her everything is ok, that she saved his life. Lou tells him that he saved hers too and the two realize that the time they have spent apart has made them very different people. The next morning, he wakes up, takes his things, and leaves while Lou is still sleeping. After being bothered yet again by the noises of feedback, he sits down outside and removes the cochlear implant processors, enjoying the silence."

But, before long, as a relentless blizzard cuts them off from the outside world, inexplicable, hair-raising occurrences push everyone beyond their limits, triggering vivid hallucinations of a traumatic, well-hidden past. Now, the inner demons demand more. Is there an escape from the lodge?—Nick Riganas Laura Hall (Alicia Silverstone), separated from her writer husband, Richard (Richard Armitage), commits suicide after Richard informs her he plans to marry Grace Marshall (Riley Keough), a woman he met while researching a book about a fundamentalist Christian cult. Raised in the cult, Grace was the sole survivor of their mass suicide, led by her father, Aaron. Laura's death devastates her and Richard's children, teenage Aidan (Jaeden Lieberher) and young Mia (Lia McHugh).Six months later, Richard announces to his children at Thanksgiving that they will spend Christmas together with Grace at the family's remote lodge in rural western Massachusetts to get to know each other. That night, Aidan and Mia access their father's computer and uncover Grace's past, including disturbing video footage of the cult, showing each of the deceased followers draped in purple silk with a strip of duct tape across their mouths reading ""Sin.""Several days before Christmas, the four arrive at the lodge, where the children act openly hostile toward Grace and refuse efforts to bond with her. When Richard departs back to the city for a work obligation, the children continue to act abrasively toward her. Grace's unease is compounded by the abundance of Catholic iconography in the cabin, which causes her to have nightmares about her father. Tensions rise after Grace catches Aidan watching her shower.

Buried in the snow, she discovers a photo of Aidan and Mia in a memorial frame, and inside, finds the children frantically praying over a newspaper article detailing the deaths of all three from carbon monoxide poisoning on December 22nd. Aidan hysterically insists they are in purgatory, and hangs himself in the attic as proof that they are dead, only to inexplicably survive.Grace suffers a nervous breakdown, which intensifies when she finds her dog frozen to death outside. She then enters a catatonic state on the porch. Worried she might die of exposure, the children finally admit to Grace that they have been gas-lighting her the entire time, having drugged her, hidden their possessions in a crawlspace, and played recordings of her father's sermons at night via a wireless speaker. Mia has been calling Richard daily so that he will not suspect something is wrong. With their own phones dead at last, the children unsuccessfully attempt to start the generator and bring Grace her medication, but find her now completely insane.... wholly convinced that they are in purgatory and must do penance to ascend to heaven.That night, the children find Grace self-flagellating by burning herself on the hearth. They barricade themselves in the attic, but are confronted by Grace in the morning, who insists they must ""sacrifice something for the Lord."" Richard returns to discover an inconsolable Grace brandishing his pistol. In an attempt to prove her belief that they are in purgatory, she fires the gun at him, killing him. Aidan and Mia attempt to flee in the car, but get stuck in the snow.

Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) and Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) are standing by a lake after their train robbery. They discuss their plans to leave the meth business behind them. Jesse asks Mike where he would go, and Mike responds that he would go to Alaska. Jesse hopes his next step will be to right his wrongs, but Mike says that's one thing he can't undo.In the present, Walter White, AKA ""Heisenberg"", (Bryan Cranston) is now dead after helping Jesse escape the captivity of the neo-Nazi gang. Jesse drives the El Camino triumphantly down the road until he almost comes across a police car. He manages to hide as the cop passes, and he then makes his way to the home of his best friends, Badger (Matt Jones) and Skinny Pete (Charles Baker). The two are in shock to see Jesse in his condition, as they had heard about his enslavement. They provide Jesse with food and a place to sleep for the night, and they stash the El Camino in the back at Jesse's behest.The following morning, news of the Nazi gang's massacre, Walt's death, and Jesse's involvement as his partner and prisoner of the Nazis hits the airwaves, which Badger and Skinny watch. They go to Jesse's room, but he has some PTSD from his captivity and pulls his gun on the two when they go check up on him. In the wake of all the news, they suggest that Jesse take a shower and stay out of sight. Jesse washes the grime and blood off of him, which makes him remember when the Nazis sprayed him with a hose. He comes out of the bathroom clean-shaven, and he tells the guys he needs to get rid of the El Camino. They contact Old Joe (Larry Hankin) from the dump, and he heads to the house agreeing to take care of the job for free. This changes when the LoJack on the El Camino is activated, meaning cops are already on their way. Thinking quickly, Skinny gives Jesse the keys to Badger's car while Badger is to drive Skinny's car to the border and hide it, which leaves Skinny with the El Camino to provide cops with a cover story. Jesse proceeds to make his way out of there.Jesse drives away and tries to maintain obscurity as a whole line of cop cars head toward Badger and Skinny's house. As he heads on, he stops to pull over somewhere as he contemplates his next move. He listens to the radio and hears news reporting on Walt's death, as well as the woman he poisoned with ricin (Lydia) not expected to survive.Another flashback shows Jesse's time in captivity. While the rest of the Nazis were away, Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons) takes Jesse out of his cage to ask for help on a task. After placing a top on Todd's car, he brings Jesse to his apartment where Jesse spots the corpse of Todd's cleaning lady Sonia. According to Todd, she came across his hidden stash of money, which he kept inside a hollowed-out almanac, and although he liked Sonia, Todd felt compelled to kill her to cover his tracks. He makes Jesse help him bury her by rolling up her body in a rug and burying her in the desert. At one point, Jesse reaches into the car and takes out a gun with the intention of killing Todd, but Todd talks him down and mentions he was going to buy pizza on the way back. Jesse just breaks down in tears and hands the gun over.Back in the present, Jesse makes his way to Todd's now closed-off apartment in order to find said stash of money, while also trying to stay hidden from one of the tenants in the building. As he tries searching for the money, he spots a news report on TV with his parents Arthur (Michael Bofshever) and Diane (Tess Harper), who urge Jesse to turn himself in.Jesse spends the night looking through every inch of the house for the money and almost gives up until he discovers it is hidden inside the refrigerator door. At that moment, two men posing as detectives, Neil (Scott MacArthur) and Casey (Scott Shepherd), enter the building to look for the money. Jesse stays hidden until Casey comes upon him, at which point Jesse aims his gun at him and makes him give his up. Neil comes over as Casey calls him, and he draws his gun on Jesse, claiming that there are cops who will hear the commotion and come storming up there. Jesse quickly realizes they aren't cops and that they were affiliated with the Nazis. Jesse offers to show them where it is on the condition that they split it three ways. Neil agrees to it after Jesse shows him where it is. As they leave, Jesse notices Neil's truck from Kandy Welding Co, and Neil tells Jesse he was wondering when he would recognize him.Jesse continues his move when he spots a vacuum cleaner store, as well as a red minivan. He enters the store and meets Ed Galbraith (Robert Forster), the identity eraser that Jesse was supposed to meet through Saul Goodman. Jesse acknowledges that there are no second chances with Ed, but he takes out the big bag of Todd's money and gives Ed the $125,000 that is needed to do the job. Ed says that only covers the previous intended encounter, and this current job would require another $125K. Jesse comes up short $1,800, so Ed refuses to help. As Jesse is determined to get the job done at any cost, he locks himself and Ed in the store, but Ed starts to call the cops. Jesse thinks he's bluffing since Ed hung up so quickly, as well as having to explain why Jesse is there in the first place, but a cop car pulls up almost instantly. Jesse runs and hides, and Ed gives the cops a fake description of the suspect he called about. Jesse calls Ed and agrees to find the rest of the money.We see another flashback of Jesse as a prisoner. This is when Neil first came to the Nazi compound to set up the mechanism that they used to keep Jesse chained up. Kenny (Kevin Rankin) torments Jesse by forcing him to run until he breaks the whole thing off, just to settle a bet with Neil that what he built isn't as strong as he claims.Jesse calls his parents in their home. He asks to speak to his brother, but they tell him he is away in London. Jesse mentions their appearance on the news and their suggestion he turn himself in, but they insist it's for his protection. He asks them to pick him up at the park, and also adds that they did their best in raising him, and however he turned out is all on him. Jesse waits for his parents and the cops watching their house to leave so he can sneak inside the house and get two guns that they had stashed away.Jesse tracks down Kandy Welding Co and finds Neil and Casey's location where they are hanging out with their three friends and some strippers. After the women leave, Jesse enters the shop and requests the rest of the money he needs to get out. Neil notes the .22 caliber pistol in Jesse's waistband and challenges him to a duel with his .45 caliber pistol. Jesse agrees, but as Neil gets ready to grab his gun, Jesse shoots him dead with the other gun he had hidden. Casey then tries to shoot at Jesse, leading to them exchanging fire and constantly missing until Jesse manages to shoot him in the head. Jesse then orders the remaining three men to give him their drivers licenses to keep their addresses known in case they say anything to the cops. Jesse then gets the money and blows up the shop with fuel tanks.One more flashback shows Jesse with Walt after their meth cookout in the desert when their RV broke down. They have found a room to rest and go to have breakfast. Walt tells Jesse that he should think about his future, with the potential for college or even getting his GED, not realizing that Jesse already graduated high school. Walt also lets Jesse know that he's lucky he didn't have to wait his whole life to do something special.Jesse gives Ed all the money, and he helps take him to Alaska, now using the name ""Driscoll"". Jesse leaves Ed with a letter to mail to Brock (son of Jesse's late girlfriend Andrea). As Jesse drives away, he has one last flashback with his former girlfriend Jane Margolis (Krysten Ritter). He mentions her philosophy of the universe bringing people where they have to be, but she says it's bullshit and says it's better to make those decisions yourself.The film concludes with Jesse continuing his drive, now ready to start a new life."

Saint Maud,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7557108/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A pious nurse becomes dangerously obsessed with saving the soul of her dying patient. There but for the grace of God goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Making her feature-film debut, writer/director Rose Glass cannily lures the audience into this disturbed psyche, steadily setting up her veritable diary of a country nurse for an unnerving and ultimately shocking trajectory. Morfydd Clark (also at the Festival in The Personal History of David Copperfield) portrays the sanctimonious Maud with an intense stoicism that belies a disquieting vulnerability, as Maud desperately vies for absolution and solidarity from her embittered patient (an enthralling Jennifer Ehle, also at the Festival in Beneath the Blue Suburban Skies). Glass tenderly captures this relationship with an empathetic gaze that first assumes an ethereal, dreamlike atmosphere--but before long, Maud's dogmatic candor incites an irreconcilable friction that spirals her mind into a suffocating confluence of creeping doubt and paranoia. As Glass tightens the screws on her misguided martyr, well-placed nods are made to religious horror forerunners like William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist,"" further contributing to the film's increasingly dread-filled malaise. And when this insidious fever climatically breaks, the consequences are devastating and terrifying in equal measure.—Toronto International Film Festival Deeply-religious Maud, a tight-lipped live-in nurse with a dark past, takes a job in a humdrum English coastal town to look after Amanda Köhl, a once-celebrated, now terminally-ill former dancer and choreographer. Convinced that she has been sent to sensualist, chain-smoking Amanda with a purpose, ascetic Maud soon becomes obsessed with saving her vulnerable patient from herself, and in the process, lead her to the light. However, is worldly Amanda prepared to receive absolution for her sins?—Nick Riganas A nurse named Katie fails to save the life of a patient in her care, despite attempting CPR.Some time later, Katie, now referring to herself as Maud, has become a devout Roman Catholic and is working as a private palliative care nurse in an English seaside town. She is assigned to care for Amanda, a dancer and choreographer from the U.S. who is terminally ill with stage four lymphoma. Amanda is embittered by her fate and confesses to Maud that she fears the oblivion of death. Maud comes to believe that God has tasked her with saving the atheist Amanda's soul. Maud reveals to Amanda that she sometimes feels God's presence and she and Amanda appear to be overcome with ecstasy as they pray together.Maud becomes suspicious of Amanda's companion Carol, who visits regularly and whom Amanda pays for sex. She implores Carol to stop visiting as she believes Amanda's soul is in jeopardy. Carol attends Amanda's birthday party anyway and in front of Maud, Amanda informs the party-goers that Maud tried to drive Carol away. She mocks the young nurse for trying to save her soul. Maud strikes Amanda and is dismissed from her job.Believing that God has rejected her, Maud visits a pub to find companionship but is rejected by most of the people she meets. She goes home with a man and during sex, suffers flashbacks of the death of her patient and her attempts at CPR, which causes her to stop. The man rapes her and then, as she is leaving, taunts her by revealing he remembers her hooking up with a friend of his during her hedonistic past.While out walking, she encounters Amanda's new nurse and storms off when she realizes that her replacement enjoys a good relationship with Amanda. In her decrepit apartment, Maud begs for a sign from God who appears to tell her to be ready for an act that will demonstrate her faith. Maud interprets a vortex in the clouds as a sign from God.That night, Maud, dressed in a makeshift robe and wearing rosary beads, enters Amanda's house after the care nurse leaves. She finds Amanda in bed, weakened. Amanda asks forgiveness for mocking her faith and Maud joyously reminds her of the time they experienced God's presence. Amanda reveals that she feigned the experience and that God is not real. Maud recoils in horror as a now-demonic Amanda hurls her across the room and mocks her for needing to prove her faith. In a delirious frenzy, Maud stabs Amanda to death.In the morning, Maud wanders onto a beach and douses herself with acetone before horrified onlookers. She utters her last words in Welsh - ""Glory to God"" - as she self-immolates. In her last moments, angel wings appear upon her and the onlookers kneel in awe as Maud looks up to the sky glowing with grace. The scene then reverts to reality briefly, revealing a burning Maud screaming in agony.(copied from Wikipedia)"

Five former Special Forces operatives reunite to plan a heist in a sparsely populated multi-border zone of South America. For the first time in their prestigious careers these unsung heroes undertake this dangerous mission for self instead of country. But when events take an unexpected turn and threaten to spiral out of control, their skills, their loyalties and their morals are pushed to a breaking point in an epic battle for survival.—Netflix Five ex special forces soldiers turn a police operation plan into their own and rob a cocaine cartel boss of all his cash $$$ at his house in the Amazon jungle at the triple borders - Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Problems arise after the plan's initiated.—Scott Filtenborg Santiago ""Pope"" Garcia works as a private military adviser in Colombia combating drug crime. While there, an informant named Yovanna asks for his help with smuggling her and her brother out of the country in exchange for information on the whereabouts of a drug lord named Lorea. Yovanna tells Pope that Lorea lives in a safe house in the jungle along with all his cash.Pope travels home to the States to recruit his old Delta Force friends to seize the money under the pretense of working for the Colombian government: Tom ""Redfly"" Davis, a realtor; William ""Ironhead"" Miller, a motivational speaker; his brother Ben Miller, a mixed martial arts fighter; and Francisco ""Catfish"" Morales, a former pilot. With persuasion from Pope, they decide to steal the money for themselves.The group, wanting to minimize casualties, plans to move on the house while Lorea's family is at church. They quietly subdue the guards but cannot find Lorea or the money. Pope realises that the money is in the walls, and the team finds that there is far more than they expected and rush to get as much as possible before Lorea's family and guards return. Redfly becomes consumed by the money and demands the crew continue loading it past the hard stop that he himself set until they convince him that they are out of time. With the money safely loaded in the truck, they make one last sweep for Lorea; he ambushes them and wounds Ironhead, before being killed by Pope. As the crew tends to Ironhead's wounds, and now several minutes past their getaway time, some guards return. The crew take them out, burn down the house, and escape in the van, driving by Lorea's family, who are returning from church.They meet up with Yovanna and her brother with $250 million in the van, and then rendezvous with Ironhead's old friend who provides them a private Mi-8MTV-1 transport helicopter to reach their getaway boat that would allow them to escape from South America. Catfish is skeptical that the helicopter can hold the weight of all the money at high altitudes as they have to fly over the Andes Mountains to make it to the meeting point. Unwilling to leave behind any of the money, Redfly urges Catfish to proceed. The crew takes off with the money in a net bag attached under the helicopter. They transport Yovanna into Peru with her brother. Redfly aggressively questions her knowledge of them, knowing she could link them to the robbery. Before leaving, Pope leaves Yovanna and her brother with a share of the stolen money and visas to Sydney, Australia, and urges them to leave South America as soon as possible to avoid being caught by the gangsters. As the group takes off, an unsatisfied Redfly claims that Yovanna was lying to him but Pope talks him down. Fixated on the money, Redfly becomes more and more willing to break his own rules and do whatever is necessary to escape with the money.As planned, the crew begin flying over the Andes Mountains. However as they are reaching the helicopter's maximum ceiling, one of the helicopter's gearboxes is overwhelmed and damaged due to the cargo load exceeding the maximum weight, causing their helicopter to enter a rapid descent. Unable to recover, Catfish urges the team to release the money bag to allow for a safe crash landing, which the group survives. Redfly and Pope attempt to retrieve the ditched money bag, which landed in a cocaine farm field village, by negotiating with the local farmers and villagers. Their attempts to peacefully retrieve the money fails due to a heated confrontation arising as the farmers mistake the group for DEA agents and view them as hostile upon noticing Catfish and Ben in the distance. When one of the angry farmers approaches with a machete, Redfly draws out his pistol and kills him and several others, prompting the other villagers to back down. While Catfish, Ironhead, and Benny prepare a group of mules to transport the money, Pope and Redfly compensate the village elder with some of the money before the group continues on their way.When they reach the top of the mountain and make their way down, a firefight takes place with two villagers seeking to avenge the deaths of their families. Redfly takes one of them out before being killed by the second villager, who Pope kills. After a brief argument between Ben and Ironhead, Pope urges them on stating that both Redfly's family and they themselves deserve the money at this point. They proceed towards the ocean with the money and Redfly's body.Ben scouts ahead and reports that their getaway boat is still there but the village is filled with armed teens waiting for them. While Pope initially argues that they ""go through"" the armed teens, the others vehemently disagree. Knowing they cannot sneak all the money through the town, they toss the money into a ravine, keeping only what they can carry in their backpacks. They attempt to quietly make their way through the town to the boat carrying Redfly's body, but are discovered. After a car chase, the team makes it to safety in the boat with $5 million and Redfly's body.Later, as the team sets up an offshore account in St. John's, a lawyer provides paperwork disseminating the funds evenly between the 4 men and Redfly's family trust. However, the guilt-ridden men each agree to give their shares to Redfly's family. Afterwards, the team go their separate ways with Pope planning to head to Australia to find Yovanna. Before leaving, Ironhead gives Pope a set of coordinates scribbled on a piece of paper, the location of the ravine in Peru where they left the money behind."

In the morning, Liz wakes up and sees Ted isn't next to her, and she can't find her daughter Molly until she walks into the kitchen to find Ted making breakfast with Molly sitting near him.As footage of Ted and Liz being together and raising Molly plays, we hear a news report on a series of grisly murders involving numerous female victims. Witnesses identified the suspect as a man faking a broken arm in a cast who lured women in Lake Sammamish to his car asking for help loading a boat onto his car. A sketch has also been released of a man looking like Ted.Utah, 1975Ted is pulled over by a police officer and is promptly arrested. He is being named as a suspect in an attempted kidnapping of a woman named Carol DaRonch (Grace Victoria Cox). Ted gets a lawyer, John O'Connell (Jeffrey Donovan), who gets his bail reduced so he can be back with Liz soon. When he does see Liz again, she is angry with him for his arrest. He tells her that someone had given the cops his name in Utah that led to his arrest. Ted also sees a black car that has been following him since he got back. He later goes to a library and is kicked out after a patron recognizes Ted from the newspaper, after which he spots the black car outside driving off as Ted approaches it.Just before the kidnapping trial, O'Connell brings up the disappearance of the women at Lake Sammamish and how his name ended up on the suspect list. DaRonch later identifies Ted as the man who tried to kidnap her, but O'Connell tries to defend him by insinuating that she was set up to frame Ted. However, Ted is later found guilty of the kidnapping and is remanded to Utah State Prison. Liz is devastated by the verdict, but Ted assures her he will prove his innocence.Upon arrival at the prison in March 1976, Ted is harassed by other inmates since he committed crimes against women. He is being investigated by Detective Mike Fisher (Terry Kinney), who wants answers from Ted and also contacts Liz regarding the case. While she wants to believe Ted is innocent, the stress of the case starts to take a toll on her, and she begins to drink. Even O'Connell gives up on being Ted's lawyer as things get worse.

She starts finding comfort with friend and coworker Jerry Thompson (Haley Joel Osment).In Aspen, Colorado, Ted is soon on trial for the murder of Caryn Campbell. He is held without bail while the death penalty is being sought against him. His new lawyer, Jim Dumas (Justin McCombs), thinks this is just circumstantial. Ted starts to plan an escape while reporters start to interview him while he is in prison. During a trial recess, Ted spots an opportunity as the guard watching him is talking to a young woman, so he uses it as a chance to jump out the window to escape. He changes clothes in the streets and walks off before authorities proceed to hunt him down.

She leaves him with a drawing that Molly made for him.In December later that same year, Ted later escapes from jail once again by cutting a hole through a ceiling in his cell.

As the media draws attention to Ted's case, he earns a number of female fans because of how handsome he is, which also leads them to think he really is innocent. Among them is an old friend of Ted's named Carole Ann Boone (Kaya Scodelario), who moves to Florida to be closer to him.Ted gets a public defender, Dan Dowd (Brian Geraghty), while prosecutor Larry Simpson (Jim Parsons) tries to find evidence to convict Ted. Dowd tells Ted that the state is offering him a deal wherein he would plead guilty to killing the sorority girls and get life sentences instead of the death penalty. Ted refuses to take it.In 1979, the trial against Ted begins with Judge Edward T. Cowart (John Malkovich) overseeing the trial. Ted is apparently allowed to defend himself during the trial, attempting to sway public opinion toward him while denying the evidence against him, though his behavior makes Dowd quit on him. He grows closer to Carole Ann, but she thinks he still loves Liz. Liz, meanwhile, admits to Jerry that it was her who gave Ted's name to the police in Utah. During one trial hearing, Ted proposes to Carole Ann, who accepts, and they are legally married in the courthouse. She later becomes pregnant with his child.The jury then makes their final verdict.

Dark Waters,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A corporate defense attorney takes on an environmental lawsuit against a chemical company that exposes a lengthy history of pollution. Cincinnati, Ohio 1998: Up-and-coming corporate attorney Robert Bilott, a new partner at a prestigious law firm, is visited by one of his grandmother's neighbors from West Virginia. Angry farmer Wilbur O. Tennant asks him to sue chemical multinational DuPont. His cows, according to the accusation, are being poisoned by a nearby landfill. Such a mandate is actually out of the question for Bilott, because he normally represents corporations. When he drives to remote Parkersburg to see for himself, his mind changes abruptly. The lawyer sees shocking evidence of the poisoning of the cattle with his own eyes: black teeth, huge tumors and terrible deformities. With the backing of his law firm boss Tom Terp, he files a lawsuit and gains access to confidential company files. While DuPont routinely plays for time, Bilott uncovers a scandal that is also endangering the health of many people. Much to his wife's chagrin, the idealistic lawyer gets stuck in the case, putting his career and health at risk. And yet he doesn't give up.—ADR Das Erste In 1998, Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) is a corporate defense attorney in Cincinnati, Ohio. One day at the office, farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), an acquaintance of Robert's grandmother, arrives with boxes of videotapes, requesting Robert's assistance. Robert doesn't have time for him, but later drives out to his home town of Parkersburg, West Virginia, to see his grandmother and then Wilbur. Wilbur shows him evidence - from video tapes he's made to remaining cow parts - of how all 190 of his cows have died, showing signs of bizarre and strange disease. He knows it has to do with the huge company DuPont, who has a plant in town, since his brother had been working for them disposing of waste. Robert asks his boss, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) if he can take the case, assuring him it will be a small side project. Tom reluctantly agrees.At a function for attorneys, Robert broaches the subject with DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber), who politely tells him he's not aware of the specifics but will help out in any way he can. Mark files a small suit so he can gain information through legal discovery of the chemicals that have been dumped on the site. He doesn't find anything useful, then realizes it's possible that whatever poisoned Wilbur's cattle could be something that isn't even regulated by the EPA. At an awards dinner, he presses Phil on the issue, who curses at him and calls him a hick. Robert is able to legally force DuPont to turn over its information, which it does, sending him hundreds of boxes of documents hoping he'll never find anything. He goes through the files one by one, finally finding reference to a chemical called PFOA that he can't find anything about. He continues going through the documents.In the middle of the night, Robert's pregnant wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He tells her they're being poisoned, and she thinks he's gone mad, until he explains what he's found in the DuPont documents: PFOA-C8 is a man-made chemical used in the production of Teflon. It was created for army tanks, but then used by companies in American homes. DuPont has been running tests of the affect of it for decades, including on animals and on their own employees. Their own studies show that it caused cancer in animals, people, and birth defects in babies of women working on their line - and they never said a thing. They then dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Wilbur's farm.Wilbur, meanwhile, has been shunned by the entire local community for suing their biggest employer. His house is broken into, and he gets sicker. Robert goes to him with the evidence and tells Wilbur to take the settlement DuPont is offering, but Wilbur refuses, wanting justice and not wanting to stay silent. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert feels guilty, and so he gets Wilbur the settlement, he also writes a brief with all the DuPont evidence and sends it to the EPA and Department of Justice, among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.DuPont sends a letter to Parkersburg residents telling them that there is PFOA in the water but in safe amounts. Darlene Kiger (Mare Winningham) and her husband get the letter and approach Robert, Darlene remembering her first husband's illness while working in the plant that the employees called ""Teflon flu"". She also had to have a hysterectomy before she was 40. Robert decides to start with the Kigers to lead a class action lawsuit against DuPont - he wants a settlement and also medical management for the people of Parkersburg, meaning DuPont will have to monitor and take care of their health care. There is push-back at a meeting with the partners at the law firm, who think this will ruin the firm's reputation to go after a company that they would normally be defending. Tom angrily chastises them, arguing that this is the right thing to do.Robert takes the class action to court in Charleston, West Virginia in order to secure medical monitoring, with local attorney Harry Dietzler (Bill Pullman), and since PFOA isn't regulated, they argue that DuPont is liable because the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion their internal documents argued to be safe. In court, DuPont claims they did a new study that says that 150 parts per billion is safe. Robert is aghast, and the locals begin protesting DuPont and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. Legally, they are only required to do medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments, so an independent scientific review is set up to study the affects of PFOA. If they find in favor, DuPont will have to pay up. In order to get data for it, the firm tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood, and nearly 70,000 people donate to the study.Years and years go by, with no result from the study. Wilbur passes away, the Kiger family are harassed locally, and Robert faces extreme financial strain, having worked the entire case on the promise of the settlement and continuing to work on it, having to pay scientific experts. He's taken pay cut upon pay cut at the firm, and things are tense with Sarah. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut, Robert collapses, shaking. At the hospitals, the doctors tell Sarah he had an ischemia, or minor stroke, and that he needs to get on new medication and stop dealing with so much stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure, since he's done something for people who needed help.Finally, seven years after the panel was convened, the scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family, Rob is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. He is angry, saying Wilbur told him that there wasn't any justice and he didn't believe him. So Rob decides to take each defendant's case to DuPont, one at a time.A post-script text explains that Rob won his first three multi-million dollar settlements against DuPont, and finally DuPont settles the class action for $671 million. PFOA is still in the blood of 99% of life on earth, and thousands of chemicals are still unregulated."

Color Out of Space,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5073642/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A secluded farm is struck by a strange meteorite which has apocalyptic consequences for the family living there and possibly the world. A story of cosmic terror about The Gardners, a family who moves to a remote farmstead in rural New England to escape the hustle of the 21st century. They are busy adapting to their new life when a meteorite crashes into their front yard. The mysterious aerolite seems to melt into the earth, infecting both the land and the properties of space-time with a strange, otherworldly color. To their horror, the Gardner family discover that this alien force is gradually mutating every life form that it touches...including them. When an iridescent meteorite plummets from outer space and into the property and foundations of a remote New England estate, a malignant force begins to insidiously permeate the lives of an unassuming family. The effects are gradual - time begins to dilate, nature assumes an otherworldly hue - and all things bright and beautiful eventually mutate and corrupt under its influence. So proceeds this eerie adaptation of the short story by H.P. Lovecraft, one of horror's most haunting, here presented by the enigmatic South African filmmaker Richard Stanley. Returning to Midnight Madness 29 years after his hypnotic killer-robot fandango Hardware first premiered in the section, Stanley summons his uniquely hallucinogenic sensibilities to envelope his endearing characters in surreal, incremental dread. At first, their domestic bliss is quietly fraught with an undercurrent of unnerving tension, before eventually boiling over into delirious, acid-fueled terror. The patriarch of this doomed brood is none other than Nicolas Cage, continuing his recent renaissance as a midnight-movie staple with an increasingly unhinged performance that reliably ricochets among every technique in the Stanislavski playbook. The rest of the ensemble, which includes Joely Richardson and Tommy Chong, play effective foils to Cage's delirium, but the real star of the show is the alien entity itself. This all-consuming, dispassionate menace manifests itself in a series of grotesque, body-horror, and psychedelic spectacles, worthy of its ineffable literary origins.—Toronto International Film Festival After a meteorite lands in the front yard of their farm, Nathan Gardner (Nicolas Cage) and his family find themselves battling a mutant extraterrestrial organism as it infects their minds and bodies, transforming their quiet rural life into a technicolor nightmare.—RLJE Films In the lands west to Arkham (New England) lives the Gardner family: father Nathan, mother Theresa, older brother Benny, middle sister Lavinia and little child Jack.

Looking for help, Nathan calls Mayor Tooma and Sheriff Pierce with unsuccessful results, but Ward appears and interests about it, accepting Nathan's advice to meet Ezra, the old hippie who lives close to them. However, the Gardner's family life turns soon in a nightmare: Nathan's body start to be infected by the arms and absent-minded Theresa cuts herself two fingers while she was cutting carrots to dinner. While Nathan takes Theresa to the hospital, the other three feel the corrupt influence of the meteorite: Jack obsesses with ""the man in the well"" that he hears all the time, Benny experiments memory losses by time dilation and Lavinia feels her own body ill. At the same time, animals and plants in the vicinity mutate by the contact bathed with the color. But when Nathan and Theresa return from the hospital, horror takes over Gardners: a wave of color hit Jack and Theresa to transform them in an unspeakable being.

As Nathan rushes her to the hospital, he leaves Benny in charge. On Nathan's request, Benny goes outside to put the farm's alpacas back in their stables, but does not return until late at night, claiming time had passed instantaneously for him. Meanwhile, Lavinia attempts multiple times to contact Nathan, but they are unable to hear each other through the phone. Upon the parents' return, Nathan lashes out at Benny and Lavinia with uncharacteristic rage.Later, Nathan becomes frustrated after finding that his most recent harvest of fruits has proven inedible, and Theresa snaps after losing a work client due to the faltering Internet connection, bringing the two to a fight. The same night, Lavinia tries to perform a Wiccan ceremony to save her family, mutilating herself in the process.

At Ezra's house, the pair only find his desiccated corpse and a recording he left behind, where he surmises that the Color is attempting to remake Earth into ""something it knows."" Heading back towards the farmhouse, a mutated living tree kills the sheriff.Ward returns to rescue Lavinia, but finds her possessed by the Color, which explodes out of the well and forms a funnel into the sky. Ward is shown a vision of where the Color hails from, an exoplanet inhabited by tentacled alien entities, before Lavinia disintegrates. As space and time begin to unravel, Ward enters the farmhouse and is pursued by a murderous apparition of Nathan. He hides in the wine cellar as the Color's distortion of reality drives the property to destruction, leaving Ward the only survivor as he climbs out of the farmhouse's colorless debris.In an epilogue, a traumatized Ward stands on top of the finished dam which covers the former property, and narrates that having witnessed the Color's takeover, he will never drink the dam's water."

Eli is a young boy suffering from a rare disease that causes severe allergic reactions to the outdoors, forcing him to live his life in protective gear. His parents, Rose and Paul, have taken him to Dr. Isabella Horn's secluded medical facility, in a large, old house that has been modernized and hermetically quarantined. Eli is initially overjoyed that the facility allows him to remove his ""bubble suit"", embrace his parents, and enjoy comforts previously denied to him. His joy is short-lived, however, as he begins to experience supernatural phenomena in various parts of the house. He also begins his treatments, which are excruciatingly painful. As the supernatural encounters increase, the specters repeatedly leave him the message lie, and Eli wonders if the spirits are trying to warn him about Horn's treatments.Eli befriends Haley, a young girl with whom he speaks through a large window in the house's lower level. She is the only person who believes his claims that the house is haunted, as Horn has told his parents Eli's visions are hallucinations caused by the treatments. Haley also tells him none of the other patients Horn treated left the facility, implying that they died. With Haley's help, Eli manages to discover the word ""lie"" is actually the inverted number 317, the passcode to Horn's office.

The Dirt,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800325/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Based on the bestselling autobiography from Mötley Crüe, the film is an unflinching tale of success and excess as four misfits rise from the streets of Hollywood to the heights of international fame. Based on Mötley Crüe's 2001 best-selling autobiography, THE DIRT is an unflinching story about sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, fame, and the high price of excess. Director Jeff Tremaine shows us just how Nikki Sixx (Douglas Booth), Mick Mars (Iwan Rheon), Tommy Lee (Colson Baker), and Vince Neil (Daniel Webber) took Mötley Crüe from the Sunset Strip to the world stage, and what it meant to become the world's most notorious rock band.—Netflix Franklin Carlton Ferrana, Jr has had enough of his mother and her constant, never ending stream of partners. It's been this way ever since his dad left. The only thing he unfortunately got stuck with was his name. In order to stage his revenge, Frank becomes tired of the abuse from his latest stepfather and decides to do something drastic that ends with the police being called. He does so. 10 years later, we see that Frank Jr. had moved to Los Angeles. He is waiting in line at the county court's office to pick up his new ID. As he sets fire to his old one we learn that he had legally changed his name to: Nikki Sixx. As he leaves the court house, he sets fire to his old ID and his old life.Meanwhile, at the Bass house, Tommy Lee is leading a seemingly normal life with his parents and his sister. With whom he was having an argument with about his questionable fashion choices for his latest show. After the show, Tommy had heard about Nikki through the various musician circles that he belonged to. A nervous Tommy goes to recruit Nikki at a nearby diner, and after several shots of Jack, Nikki agrees to join Tommy.They decide that they need a bass guitar player and a singer to fill the rest of the band. Tommy puts a personal ad in the LA Weekly tabloid newspaper looking for a bass guitarist. A musician by the name of Robert Deal, who goes by the stage name ""Mick Mars"" answers the ad and now they've got something. However, Mick could be a liability to the band because he suffers from a rare degenerative bone disease. The band is almost complete. Except for a singer. Tommy remembers this guy that he went to high school with that would be perfect.Tommy, Mick, and Nikki go to a mid size party in LA where Vince Neil is playing with a band that he formed. Tommy and Vince instantly reunite and Tommy asks Vince to join his band that he's been forming. Vince is reluctant to at first join because he's already got a gig. But when his band decides to switch genres and Vince is no longer a good fit, Vince decides to leave his current gig and join Tommy and the guys. After a few rounds of rehearsals and song writing, the guys decide that they're ready to take this show on the road.Sitting around and having a few beers, the guys decide to come up with a name for their new band. Several failed attempts from Tommy and Nikki produce nothing. Then Mick has an idea that he's been saving for a long time. They call their new band ""Motley Crew"". But after a couple of changes, Mötley Crüe was born. Their first show was nearly an utter disaster when Tommy's drum kit falls apart on stage and they have some hecklers in the audience. But after kicking the heckler's asses and getting them thrown out, their near-miss turns into a huge hit.Night after night, the audiences start pouring in. The Crüe starts playing every venue on the Sunset Strip to packed houses and long lines, and the money starts pouring in. Which means better drugs and bigger parties. They start partying with Sunset Strip royalty including David Lee Roth and Eddie Van Halen. In fact the story where they met their long time bodyguard, who was protecting David Lee Roth at a hotel party was told, but it wasn't exactly true.They played their first Forum gig to a sold out crowd and got rave reviews. That earned them a spot on a tour with the legendary Ozzy Osbourne. Their recklessness and their habit of destroying hotels earns them notoriety and their fan base grows. Ozzy gives them some advice about not partying too heartily or it could have serious consequences. Of course that's not before Ozzy publicly embarrasses and humiliates himself at the pool of the hotel where he and the Crue were staying.Unfortunately for the Crue, Ozzy's advice proved to be true. The tour for their third album, ""Theater Of Pain"" would prove to be both dangerous and deadly. Vince was already questioning the creative flow of the band as he thought their cover of ""Smokin' In The Boys Room"" would never work and wasn't keen on producing it, while the venues the band was being booked into weren't exactly the rowdy clubs or huge stadiums that they were used to playing. Meanwhile Tommy had met a woman named Roxy who he had engaged to wed, but on the ride home, a fight with Tommy's soon-to-be-wife led to an altercation. Meanwhile, Nikki's mother comes to visit him on the set and he's not exactly enamored with the situation.At the end of the tour, In 1984, Vince had purchased a huge mansion in Redondo Beach and was throwing a housewarming party. There, Tommy met the woman who he would later go on to marry - TV's Heather Locklear. However, while out on a booze run, Vince was with Nicholas Dingley, the drummer of the band who was opening for them, Hanoi Rocks, and was in a serious car accident on the way back that killed Dingley. Vince got 30 days in jail for vehicular manslaughter.Nikki tells the audience what living on the road was like. It was they would get on a red eye and drink all night, eventually landing at their next destination where they would immediately head to the nearest strip club. Then from the strip club they're led to the show where they play for approximately 2.5 hours, then head back to the hotel where they'd booze, party and have sex with hookers until they eventually pass out and then they're off to their next destination.Fast forward to Tommy's wedding to Heather. Tommy had asked Nikki to be his best man. Unfortunately Nikki was too whacked out on his new drug of choice - heroin, and could hardly function, and nearly ruined the wedding. The preceding fight with Tommy only made things worse for their relationship. That causes Nikki to go off the rails and he nearly dies of an overdose - only to be saved by a paramedic who was a huge Crue fan that administered two shots of adrenaline to his heart.Nikki decides that he has indeed hit rock bottom and decides to get clean, but needs the help of his band mates. They all decide to do so and go to rehab together. They switch out their hard drugs and hard partying lifestyles for institution coffee and meetings where they talk about their feelings. Living the sober life proves to work for a while. They released their fourth album ""Dr. Feelgood"" about their experiences. That proves to be their first #1. But living sober on the road proved to take a serious toll on their relationship. Vince ultimately tells Tommy that he hasn't been exactly honest about his sobriety, while Tommy acknowledges the same. This leads to a rift in the band and Vince quits and heads back home to spend time with his family.The guys continue on without Vince, but their new singer John Corabi proved to be an utter disaster. The Crue's latest tour was a flop and they played to worse audiences than ever before, and all of them demanded Vince. But Vince was at home, where he learned that his daughter Skyler was suffering from a devastating illness. Vince remains at her side the entirety of the time she is at the hospital. Unfortunately Skyler succumbs to her illness and passes away.The guys reunite at a bar and find a broken down Vince struggling to cope with his grief. He decides to rejoin the band as a way to feel alive and to honor his late daughter's memory. They do so and play to packed houses around the world for another 25 years. The final shot of the movie is the band walking on stage for their final tour, with footage from their final show on 12/31/2015."
The Highwaymen,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1860242/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The untold true story of the legendary detectives who brought down Bonnie and Clyde. The outlaws made headlines. The lawmen made history. From director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side), THE HIGHWAYMEN follows the untold story of the legendary detectives who brought down Bonnie and Clyde. When the full force of the FBI and the latest forensic technology aren't enough to capture the nation's most notorious criminals, two former Texas Rangers (Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson) must rely on their gut instincts and old school skills to get the job done.—Netflix In 1934, after two years on the run, criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow break several associates out of Texas' Eastham Prison Farm. Texas Department of Corrections Chief Lee Simmons persuades Governor ""Ma"" Ferguson to hire former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer to track down the criminals. Reluctant to leave retirement and his wife Gladys, Hamer joins the manhunt after the fugitive gang is involved in a devastating shootout in Missouri, and he recruits his former partner, Benjamin Maney Gault.Information from FBI wiretapping of the fugitives' families leads Hamer and Gault to conclude that Bonnie and Clyde are returning ""home"" to Dallas. Watching Bonnie's mother's house, they see a man throw a bottle into her yard, which is soon thrown back, but a boy escapes with it. Dismissing the Rangers' theory, the FBI believe the fugitives are in Brownsville. Hamer and Gault meet with Dallas Sheriff ""Smoot"" Schmid, who introduces them to Deputy Sheriff Ted Hinton, a childhood friend of Bonnie and Clyde who can identify them on sight. The gang kills two policemen in nearby Grapevine; Hamer and Gault investigate the scene and determine that Bonnie has a rabbit, which Hinton suggests is a present for a family member.The Rangers drive to Oklahoma and question a gas station attendant, who declares his support for the criminals. Hamer assaults the man into admitting the gang passed through en route to a migrant camp, where a local girl confirms the gang stayed. A radio bulletin alerts the Rangers to two more murdered officers but, being outside their jurisdiction, they are barred from passing the police roadblock, which a frustrated Hamer drives around. They continue to Coffeyville, Kansas, correctly guessing that Bonnie and Clyde will stop there for supplies. As the Rangers move in on the fugitives, an adoring crowd surrounds the criminals' car. Hamer and Gault give chase, but Bonnie and Clyde escape through a dirt field.Learning that Clyde had breakfast in Amarillo, the Rangers return to Dallas to find the rabbit has been delivered to Bonnie's family. Hamer meets Henry Barrow, Clyde's father, who affirms that his son must be stopped. The Rangers have Simmons furlough Wade McNabb, an incarcerated associate of the gang, hoping to draw them out. While Hamer interrogates McNabb at a bar, Gault is threatened in the restroom by thugs sympathetic to the gang, but subdues them. Learning that Bonnie plans to meet a hairdresser the next day, the Rangers surveil her mother's house again. A man throws another bottle into the yard, which is retrieved by the same boy but intercepted by the Rangers; it contains a message that the gang are heading elsewhere. Realizing McNabb warned the gang, the Rangers visit his home and discover him beaten to death.Simmons recalls Hamer and Gault to Austin, but they return to their theory that ""outlaws always go home"", predicting that the fugitives are going to Bienville Parish, Louisiana, home of gang member Henry Methvin's father, Ivy. Searching Ivy's house, the Rangers find evidence of the outlaws' recent stay. They join forces with local Sheriff Henderson Jordan and Deputy Prentiss Oakley to confront Ivy; in exchange for his son's safety, he reveals that the gang will soon return. The lawmen are joined by Hinton and Dallas Sheriff's Deputy Bob Alcorn, and Gault tells them of his first deployment with Hamer: they killed a gang of bandits, including a fleeing 13-year-old boy. Ivy informs them the gang is arriving the next day, and the posse prepare an ambush on the road to his house, staging his truck as if it has broken down.Bonnie and Clyde arrive, stopping to assist Ivy, and Hamer orders them to raise their hands. Instead, the criminals prepare to draw their own weapons, and are gunned down. The bullet-riddled car with Bonnie and Clyde's bodies is towed to Arcadia, Louisiana and mobbed by onlookers. Refusing $1,000 for an interview with the Associated Press, Hamer and Gault drive home."
The Assistant,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9000224/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A searing look at a day in the life of an assistant to a powerful executive. As Jane follows her daily routine, she grows increasingly aware of the insidious abuse that threatens every aspect of her position. Follows one day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner), a recent college graduate and aspiring film producer, who has recently landed her dream job as a junior assistant to a powerful entertainment mogul. Her day is much like any other assistant's - making coffee, changing the paper in the copy machine, ordering lunch, arranging travel, taking phone messages, onboarding a new hire. But as Jane follows her daily routine, she, and we, grow increasingly aware of the abuse that insidiously colors every aspect of her work day, an accumulation of degradations against which Jane decides to take a stand, only to discover the true depth of the system into which she has entered.—Bleecker Street The film takes place over the course of a single day in the life of Jane (Julia Garner), a junior assistant who has been working at a film production company in New York City for five weeks. Jane arrives well before dawn and performs various menial administrative tasks (turning the lights on, changing the coffee filters, printing materials for the day's presentations, arranging office supplies, removing stains from the bosses's office couch). Her job's long hours and demanding tasks keep her busy and incredibly stressed. Her boss calls her and yells at her for talking to his wife or his affairs and filling their minds with nonsense.
During a phone call with her mother, Jane learns that she forgot to call her father on his birthday.As Jane's day progresses, it becomes clear that her boss (Purva Bedi) has been having sex in his office with many younger women and facilitating a culture of sexual harassment at the company. Many of the male executives make snide comments about the boss's affairs while the female executives handle their own workloads and discuss the possibility of transferring to other departments. Whenever Jane does something her boss deems a mistake, he verbally abuses her over the phone as her two male junior assistant coworkers (Jon Orsini and Noah Robbins) watch silently. Throughout the day, a variety of people from the boss's life interact with Jane, including his wife, his children's nanny, a famous actor, and a group of Chinese film producers.In the afternoon, a young, inexperienced woman named Sienna (Kristine Froseth) arrives from Idaho, saying she has been offered a job as a junior assistant. Jane, concerned for Sienna's well-being, goes to the human resources department to file a report after dropping Sienna off at a five-star hotel being paid for by the company (Jane never got any company paid accommodation when she started and she knows that Sienna has been brought in to be her boss's new fling). The boss is shown to have mid-day sex affairs called ""personals"" (it is implied that the boss is with Sienna at the hotel, having sex with her), during which he frequently blows off client meetings. Jane has to lie to his wife (when she calls) and say that she doesn't know where he is.Wilcock (Matthew Macfadyen), the head of HR, encourages Jane to share her concerns, but later (when Jane says that she knows the boss is probably sexually assaulting Sienna at the hotel) makes it clear that he is turning a blind eye to her harassment claims, before demeaning her, speaking down to her, and stating she is jealous (a new inexperienced, pretty girl was offered an assistant position, and put up at a fancy hotel, while Jane never got that kind of treatment). He also discloses that filing a formal complaint would destroy Jane's career.As Jane leaves his office, he reminds her that she has nothing to worry about, as Jane is not the boss's ""type"". Visibly upset, Jane receives a call from her boss when she returns to her desk. He has been informed about the report which was not filed and demands Jane write an email apology addressed to him, which she does. He replies saying that he is especially hard on Jane because he knows how great she is.Toward the end of the day, Sienna arrives at the office so Jane can teach her how to use the phone systems. As night falls, Jane prepares a microwave dinner for herself while other employees leave; her boss stays late in his office with a young actress. He calls Jane on the intercom and tells her to go home. Jane goes to a coffee shop across the street and calls her father as she eats a muffin. After she hangs up, she sees a silhouette in her boss's window appearing to have sex."

Code 8,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6259380/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A super-powered construction worker falls in with a group of criminals in order to raise the funds to help his ill mother. In a world where people with ""special"" abilities are living in poverty, Conner Reed (Robbie Amell) is a powerful young man who is struggling to pay for his ailing mother's medical treatment. To earn money, he joins a lucrative criminal world led by Garrett (Stephen Amell), who works for a drug lord (Greg Bryk). In the early 20th century, the public becomes aware of people with superhuman abilities, known as Powers, resulting in the government passing a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. They quickly become a key component of the economy, notably in constructing Lincoln City as the ""City of Tomorrow."" As the Second Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized in the face of increasing mechanization, leading to severe prejudice as they become second-class citizens. By the 1990s, a crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of desperate or trafficked Powers. Police departments begin using advanced drones, named Guardians, and facial recognition software to combat Power-related crime while a city-wide Powers ban is debated.Connor Reed, a 26-year-old Class 5 Electric (electrokinetic) looks after his mother Mary, a Cryo (cryokinetic), who has brain cancer that causes her abilities to sometimes act erratically. As Powers, they cannot afford the treatment she needs. Connor makes ends meet by working as an unregistered day laborer alongside many other Powers, using his abilities to install electrical wiring without protection. While on a job, the police arrive and order the workers to disband and a Pyro (pyrokinetic) is killed when attempting to flee arrest. Elsewhere in the city, a drug raid is conducted by detectives Park and Davis on an apartment complex owned by crime lord Marcus Sutcliffe, the local agent of The Trust and a Reader (telepath). Almost $1 million worth of product is seized, putting Sutcliffe in conflict with Wesley Cumbo, his superior in The Trust who demands their expected cut in a week's time. Reed is approached by Garrett, Sutcliffe's underling and a TK (telekinetic), and his crew for a job. Despite warnings from a fellow worker, Reed goes with them and participates in a chemical theft, shorting out the electric fence in an amazing show of power. Reed is introduced to Sutcliffe and meets Nia, Sutcliffe's supposed girlfriend. Park and Davis arrive on the scene the next day and determine that Sutcliffe is using the chemicals that were stolen to cut his remaining product, indicating he is desperate for revenue.Garrett recruits Reed, recognizing he has untapped potential, and agrees to help him earn enough money to get his mother treatment. He begins training Reed on how to use his abilities and uses him as an enforcer in the Psyke trade. Reed also grows close with the members of Garrett's crew, including Freddie, a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy, Garrett's girlfriend and a Pyro. Sutcliffe has the crew rob a bank in order to pay back The Trust, but the vault only contains $50,000. Cumbo's Shifter (shapeshifter) assassin Copperhead attempts to kill Sutcliffe for not honoring his debt, but Sutcliffe's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, manages to kill them. Reed is injured in the scuffle and Nia reveals that she is a Healer, and only remains with Sutcliffe to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction in order to pay a debt.Reed's mother confronts him about the stash of money he has been making working with the crew. She suddenly convulses and Reed rushes her to hospital, where the doctor tells him they will need to operate soon to remove her tumor. Park and Davis bring Reed in for questioning, encouraging him to cooperate as they have already confiscated much of the Psyke on the street, weakening Sutcliffe's influence. Davis advises they plant evidence in order to coerce Reed into informing, while Park is adamant that they cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Reed is released and goes to Garrett to suggest they raid the scheduled Psyke Run, the monthly transport of seized product for destruction, which will be worth approximately $10 million. Garrett and Reed bring the idea to Sutcliffe, where Reed demands Nia heal his mother as payment and Garrett stipulates he will become a partner in running the Psyke trade.On the day of the heist, the crew blocks the truck while it is inside a no-fly zone, preventing back-up by drones that carry Guardians. Reed shorts out the truck's electronics and they manage to destroy the Guardians. As Maddy hands off the Psyke to Rhino, Sutcliffe's men execute the officers protecting the truck and turn on the crew, killing Maddy and mortally wounding Freddie before he, Garrett and Reed manage to escape. Rhino flees with the drugs while the drone pilot disregards the no-fly zone and drops additional Guardians into the area, killing the rest of Sutcliffe's men. Freddie dies as Reed and Garrett drive away. Reed tells Garrett that Sutcliffe betrayed them because of Garrett's demands, and they part ways. Davis and Park's captain is furious that Reed was not arrested before the heist, and demands they bring in those responsible. Park visits his daughter, a TK Power, who is afraid she will be given away because she is struggling to control her abilities. Reed contacts Park and offers up Sutcliffe's hideout. The cops raid Suttcliffe's hideout while Reed and Garrett seek revenge at his escape route. After killing Rhino and Sutcliffe, Garrett takes the Psyke for himself and encourages Reed to force Nia to heal his mother. Nia pleads with Reed to let her go, as her abilities do not just heal people, but force her to take the injury or disease onto herself, meaning she can die if she attempts to heal his mother. Reed takes Nia to the hospital at gunpoint, but finally tells her to stop after he sees how painful the process is for her. Reed shares a tearful goodbye with his mother before she dies.Reed drives to the police station and gives Nia his truck in order to leave the city. He decides to turn himself in to try and make up for his mistakes. Garrett hands over the Psyke to Cumbo and takes over the drug trade for The Trust in Lincoln City. Reed visits his mother's grave before he serves his sentence, while Nia has a tearful visit with her father in prison, whose debt she was paying off with Sutcliffe. Meanwhile, the Powers Ban is being voted on due to the heist while Park reluctantly accepts an award for the raid against Sutcliffe."

Later, he invites Mallory home, and they watch Abby getting stuff from her cellar and throwing in on the garbage can.

The next day, Ben goes to the cellar from where Abby emerged with a plastic bag and there he sees a series of pictures: one of the family with the kids-his neighbors-but the face of the father has been crossed out and the one with Mallory and her mother and her sister with the faces of the two firsts crossed out.

Klaus,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A simple act of kindness always sparks another, even in a frozen, faraway place. When Smeerensburg's new postman, Jesper, befriends toymaker Klaus, their gifts melt an age-old feud and deliver a sleigh full of holiday traditions. When Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) distinguishes himself as the postal academy's worst student, he is stationed on a frozen island above the Arctic Circle, where the feuding locals hardly exchange words let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (Oscar® winner J.K. Simmons), a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care. An animated Christmas comedy directed by Despicable Me co-creator Sergio Pablos, KLAUS co-stars Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and JK Simmons.—Netflix The film begins with a letter being delivered. We follow the letter as it makes its way through the post office system until it finally reaches the Drill Sergeant of the Royal Postal Academy. It's a summons for one of the students, Jesper Johansson (Jason Schwartzman). Jesper's father is the head of the academy and has enrolled Jesper in the hopes of teaching him about responsibility. Jesper, however, is a selfish brat and prefers to spend his time lounging in his luxurious tent.Jesper's overall performance is deemed abysmal by the drill sergeant; he's completely careless with delivering mail. His father deduces that Jesper is doing this intentionally because he wants a different ""punishment."" So he announces that Jesper is officially a postman and will be stationed in a small town named Smeerensberg. He also gives him an ultimatum: deliver 6,000 letters in a year, or he will be cut off from the family.Smeerensberg is depressingly gray and cold. When Jesper arrives, the sarcastic ferryman Mogens (Norm MacDonald) tells him to ring the bell in the town square so he can receive a welcome reception. When he does so, a huge brawl breaks out between the townspeople. Turns out that the bell is known as ""The Battle Bell."" The town is divided into two clans; The Krums and the Ellingboes, who have been fighting with each other for many years. Jesper manages to hide in a nearby schoolhouse. He meets the school teacher Miss Alva (Rashida Jones). Parents refuse to send their children to school (They don't want their kids interacting with the opposite clan), so she's been forced to sell fish. She's been saving up her earnings so she can finally leave Smeernsberg. The ferryman finds Jesper and leads him to his new home: the dilapidated post office, full of snow and chickens. A boy sledding nearby throws a snowball at Jesper and calls him a loser.The next morning, Jesper goes out to collect letters but finds none. He tries to ask the townspeople for their mail, but they're too busy fighting and pranking each other. At one house, a young boy's drawing lands at Jesper's feet. He offers to ""mail"" it back, but the boy's father chases him off. Two weeks later, Jesper has had no luck. However, there's still one house he hasn't tried yet: the woodsman, Mr. Klaus (J.K. Simmons), who lives far out of town. The home is empty, so Jesper lets himself in. In the basement, he finds hundreds of hand made toys. Klaus returns, and Jesper runs off, dropping his satchel. The boy's drawing from earlier falls out, and Klaus picks it up, curious.Jesper attempts to leave Smeerensberg but is stopped by Klaus. He wants to know where the boy lives. Jesper takes him the boy's home, but the package Klaus wants him to leave is too big for the mailbox, and the yard is full of traps. He ends up being launched up and down into the chimney (courtesy of Klaus). Jesper leaves the present and runs off, but Klaus stays behind to watch the boy unwrap it and play with the toy. The next morning, Jesper is surprised to see several children outside his house. The boy told everyone about Klaus' visit, and now they all want to mail letters to him, asking for toys. Jesper immediately starts handing out paper and pencils to the children and encourages them to make their letters sound sad. He makes a chart on the wall to keep track of how many letters he delivers. Jesper returns to Klaus' home, where the woodsman is hanging birdhouses in the trees. He shows him letters and convinces him to donate the toys in his basement. Klaus agrees.The boy is playing with his toy in the yard, and a little girl joins him. Their parents see this and quickly separate the two since they are from opposite clans. The children are brought to the clan leaders: Mr. Ellingboe (Will Sasso) and Mrs. Krum (Joan Cusack). They are told that the clans are not meant to mingle, and the reason they keep fighting with each other is because of tradition. The kids promise that it won't happen again, but Mrs. Krum is wary.Word begins to spread amongst the children about Mr. Klaus and how he comes down the chimney at night and leaves toys behind (and that he likes cookies). In reality, Jesper has been the one delivering the presents while Klaus just tags along. At one of the houses, Jesper realizes the boy who threw a snowball at him from earlier lives there and leaves a lump of coal in his stocking. At the post office, a Saami girl named Margu tries to ask for a present, but since she doesn't speak English, Jesper ignores her. A few of the children tell him they don't know how to write, so he decides to send them to Alva (since she's the schoolteacher).Alva, however, is not happy about this new development because she's so close to being able to leave. The children insist on learning how to write their names, so she starts taking money out of her savings for school supplies. Meanwhile, the number of presents has increased so drastically that Jesper's horse can't pull the wagon anymore. Klaus gets the idea to wrangle up some nearby reindeer, which makes the wagon go faster.The snowball boy confronts Jesper the following morning, demanding why he's been getting coal instead of presents. On the spot, Jesper says that Klaus sees everything that the children do, and if they are naughty, they won't get presents. The children start doing good deeds in hopes of staying in Klaus' good graces. They clean up the town and act nicer to their neighbors. Their acts of kindness start to inspire the adults to do so as well. Alva is able to stop selling fish and start teaching. Soon the town is much happier, and everyone is getting along. But Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum aren't happy with the changes. They realize Jesper is responsible for this and must be stopped.Klaus is happy to hear that the town is doing better. He remarks, ""A true selfless act always sparks another."" Jesper isn't convinced, however. He believes everyone is always out to get something. Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum attempt to ambush them, but Klaus is able to maneuver them safely away. The wagon loses its wheels in the process, and they end up ramping over a cliff side. A boy looks out his window and sees the sleigh and reindeer airborne. The next morning, rumor has spread that Klaus has flying reindeer. This makes him laugh for the first time (""Ho-ho-ho!"").Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum decide to meet late at night in the town square. The numbers of their clans are dwindling because of all the kind deeds. Mrs. Krum proposes a temporary truce so they can finally put a stop to Klaus. Mr. Ellingboe agrees, and the two shake hands. The truce is temporarily broken; however, when someone accidentally rings the ""Battle Bell,"" which starts another brawl.Jesper notices that they are running low on toys. He gets the idea to make a huge delivery on Christmas, and Klaus can make more. Klaus claims he doesn't do so anymore, but Jesper keeps insisting that they can turn Klaus' home into a workshop. In his excitement, he accidentally finds a decorative shelf of the woodsman, a young woman (his wife), and several empty holes. Klaus angrily orders Jesper to leave.Jesper returns to the post office and finds Margu waiting for him. He finally takes her to Alva so they can write her letter to Klaus in English. She wants a sled with a sail. Jesper brings the letter to Klaus' home and starts to make it, but it looks very poor. Klaus eventually takes pity and helps him. They bring the present to Margu's village (just slightly out of town) and leave it outside her tent. This time, Jesper stays behind with Klaus and watches her unwrap and play with the sled with her parents. Back at the house, Klaus finally talks about his wife, Lydia. They moved away from the village because they wanted to start a family. While they waited, he starting making toys. Sadly, they never had children, and Lydia died of an illness. He kept making birdhouses because of her love of birds. Klaus thanks Jesper for bringing joy back into his life and decides to go forward with the Christmas plan, even planning for the years to come. Jesper is hesitant because he still wants to leave Smeerensburg, but he can't bring himself to tell Klaus the truth. He stops by the schoolhouse and is surprised to see it, and Miss Alva completely transformed, more so that Alva used up all her savings. She brings him the town square which has been completely decorated for Christmas and all the townspeople are mingling with one another.Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum break into the post office and find Jesper's chart of letters delivered. They begin making several fake letters and put them on Morgens' boat since he handles all the outgoing mail. Margu brings her entire village to Klaus' workshop to help prepare for the big night. Jesper brings Alva to the workshop and starts to consider possibly settling down in Smeerensburg. Christmas Eve has arrived. The Sami village have remodeled Klau's sleigh and give Klaus a new red outfit.The good mood is broken when Jesper's father arrives; Mr. Ellingboe and Mrs. Krum invited him because over 14,000 letters have been delivered. Since he held up his end of the deal, he can go home now. Klaus and Alva are disappointed to learn about Jesper's real intentions. At the docks, Morgens tells Jesper's father that his son is the first postman to leave Smeerensburg unhappy; usually, the postmen that leave are the happiest. Margu arrives seemingly too late, but it turns out Jesper didn't leave on the boat! He told his father the truth and was allowed to stay. On the mountain top, he notices the clans carrying torches towards Klaus' home.As the sleigh is being loaded with presents, the clans arrive to destroy them. Once kids stop receiving toys, they'll eventually start fighting again, which will make the grown-ups fight again as well. Jesper jumps on the sleigh and tries to make a getaway, but it's not connected, so they sleigh rolls downhill. The clans chase after them down the hillside. Klaus refuses to help because he's still mad at Jesper, much to Jesper's annoyance, but secretly helps Jesper with the sleigh during the chase. In the process of the chase, the bag is ripped, and toys begin to fall out. Jesper frantically apologizes while trying to close the bag. Mr. Krum's gargantuan daughter, Pumpkin, almost falls to her death, but she's saved by Mr. Ellingboe's son Olaf. Jesper manages to stop the sleigh from going over the cliff side. Still, Mr. Ellingboe spitefully rips the bag further, and the presents fall.Mrs Krum insists that the town will always be miserable as long as they're in charge. Still, Jesper disagrees: a true act of goodwill always sparks another. To prove his point, Pumpkin and Olaf are no longer enemies, much to their parents' shock. Turns out, the presents on the sleigh were just logs of firewood covered in wrapping paper. The real presents were back at the workshop safe. Alva found about the plan because the children told her about it at school, and she, in turn, told Klaus. Officially forgiven, Jesper and Klaus depart to deliver the presents. Christmas morning arrives, and the children eagerly open their presents. On a nearby hill, Jesper and Klaus sit and listen.Life continues to improve in Smeerensburg. Pumpkin and Olaf get married, which makes Mrs. Krum and Mr. Ellingboe in-laws. Jesper and Alva marry and later have two children. Klaus' present operation continues growing bigger and further. Jesper and Klaus remain friends until 12 years later when Klaus disappears to be with his wife. In the epilogue, Jesper kisses his children and Alva goodnight and sits down in front of the fireplace by the Christmas tree. He hears the sound of sleigh bells and smiles, ready to see his old friend again."

He becomes friendly with Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), the only attorney at the office who doesn't talk down to him, leaving Snickers for him in his desk and playing arcade games with him on breaks. Eventually, Richard takes another job and says a friendly goodbye to Watson.1996Richard has just been fired from a police deputy job and is working as campus security at Piedmont College, where he gets into various altercations with students on campus. The college president, Ray Cleere, eventually calls Richard into his office to question him about these incidents. Richard believes he is doing his job, and tells the president that he himself told Richard he didn't want any ""Mickey Mouse"" on his campus. Cleere fires Richard.Richard lives at home with his mother, Bobi (Kathy Bates). His friend Dave Dutchess (Niko Nicotera) tells him not to worry about the firing since there are many security jobs upcoming, especially with the 1996 Olympics taking place in Georgia. Eventually, Richard does get one of those security jobs. Meanwhile, at the local FBI office, agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) is assigned to cover the concerts at Centennial Olympic Park. At the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, crime reporter Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) is also assigned to cover it, despite her reluctance.Night one of the concerts goes fine, though Richard is overly cautious and suspicious of every backpack or person acting strangely. He's able to bring Bobi and they get to watch Kenny Rogers perform together. The next day, Richard wakes up with the runs and almost calls out sick, but doesn't. Richard sees some teens throwing glass bottles, and shoos them away, then afterwards sees a backpack under a bench they were near. Meanwhile, a man makes a 911 call and tells them that a bomb is going to go off at the park. Richard, suspicious, alerts the police about the bag, who initially think he's being ridiculous, but eventually agree to follow protocol. Police find a bomb inside the bag - the bomb squad is alerted, and Richard and the rest of the police there rush to quickly get everyone away from the bomb - which does explode, causing a frenzy and killing a woman. Luckily, because of Richard's discovery, most people were away and lives were saved.The next day the story is national news, and Richard is being championed as a hero. He is surprised at all the attention, and feels he was just doing his job, but begins doing interviews with Katie Couric and others. Bobi is incredibly proud. He is approached immediately about a book deal, and unsure of how to proceed, calls the only lawyer he knows, Watson, to have him handle the contract. Meanwhile, at the FBI, Tom is upset because the bomb went off under his watch. His supervisor tells him now they need to just find the bomber and stop him.The FBI receives a call from Cleere, and so he and his partner Bennet (Ian Gomez) go to talk to him. Cleere tells him he suspects Richard could have done this, since he always wanted to be a hero and wanted this kind of attention. The FBI realizes Richard fits a profile of the ""hero bomber"" which they have seen multiple cases of - someone who creates terror so they can be a hero. Richard's record of being fired and having complaints against him is suspicious, as is the fact that in his interviews he said how he wants to be back in law enforcement.The FBI sends one of Richard's cop friends in with a wire to have dinner with him, and Richard talks all about how the bomb could have been made, which makes them suspicious. Meanwhile, while Tom is drinking at a bar, Kathy approaches him to get scoop on the bomber. He denies to offer her anything, but she flirts and tells him she'll sleep with him. He tells her Richard is the suspect and they leave to go have sex. Kathy fights to convince her editor to print the story that the FBI is investigating Richard, and he relents. The next day, when the story is out, it's all over the news before Richard even knows about it.Tom and Bennet arrive at Richard's door and tell him they need assistance with something on the case, and he goes with them to the FBI offices, naively not understanding what's happening. They tell Richard that they are shooting a training video to try to trick him into waiving his Miranda rights, but Richard picks up on it and asks to speak to a lawyer, angering the FBI. He calls Watson, leaving multiple messages. Watson's girlfriend and assistant Nadya (Nina Arianda) gets the messages and pushes Watson to call the FBI right away. They try to misdirect him, but he gets Richard on the phone and tells him to say nothing. He goes over to their office and leaves with Richard.Richard and Bobi's home is swarmed by reporters, and Watson goes over to consult with Richard. He asks Richard if he committed the crime, and he insists he didn't. On his way home, Watson is shocked to find Kathy hiding in his backseat, asking him for information. He shoos her out of his car. Later, Watson and Nadya time the walk from where Richard was to the pay phone where the 911 call was made, and realize there's no way he could have done it. Watson is interviewed on TV, and surprised with information about Richard's background and being let go as a deputy on the air. He goes to Richard and demands Richard tell him everything for his own good.The FBI arrive to search the house, taking everything, deeply upsetting Bobi as they take her Tupperware and babysitting videos. Richard has lots of hunting guns, which doesn't help him look innocent. Richard keeps being kind and helpful to the FBI, annoying Watson who has instructed him to say nothing. While Watson helps Bobi, Richard makes voice recordings for Tom, which deeply upsets Watson upon his return. Richard has heart pains but insists he's fine.Nadya learns that the apartment has been bugged. Meanwhile, the FBI takes Dave in for questioning. Dave tells Richard that they think Richard must have had an accomplice and that they think he could be Richard's gay lover. Bobi puts on a loud TV show with explosions, and Richard yells at her not to do that when they're listening. She begins crying, and Richard apologizes. Watson has Richard take a polygraph, which he passes. Watson goes to the Atlanta Journal office with his results to ask for a retraction, and chews out Kathy. Later, Kathy does the walk to the payphone and also realizes Richard is innocent. She goes to the bar to see Tom again with her information on Richard's innocence, but he rebuffs her completely, insisting Richard had an accomplice and leaving in a huff.Bobi gives an impassioned press conference where she sobs as she tells the public what they have been through, and that Richard is innocent. Kathy cries as she watches her. Watson and Richard go to the FBI to give a deposition. Watson pleads with Richard to not be deferential to the law enforcement as he always has been. During the deposition, Richard is polite, answering the questions, but when Tom viciously accuses him of being the bomber, Richard finally lays it all out and asks if they have any real evidence at all. He tells them the bomber is still out there. They go home, where Watson tells Bobi Richard did great.Eighty-eight days after the investigation into Richard began, Tom goes to see Watson and Richard as they eat in a diner, and gives him a letter from the FBI letting him know that the investigation into him is over, though Tom says he still thinks Richard did it. Richard cries, relieved, and says he wants to see his mom.Six years later, Richard is working as a deputy in a new office, when Watson comes to see him to tell him they finally caught the real bomber, who confessed. Richard asks to go to his arraignment.A post-script says that Richard died of a heart attack at age 44, Watson and Nadya got married, and Bobi babysits their two kids every weekend."

The contraband was smuggled by a huge gang headed by Adaikalam, the most wanted smuggler in Tamil Nadu, whose identity remains unknown. Adaikalam's brother Anbu plans to capture the five police, kill them, and retrieve the contraband. According to Anbu's plan, all the police officials in the city get unconscious after consuming poisoned drinks at a higher official's retirement party. Bejoy, who avoided the drink as he was under medication, tries to save the lives of all the unconscious officials without letting the media or anyone else finding out.Bejoy convinces Dilli, an ex-prisoner who happened to be there with him as he was detained for looking suspicious (and being the only one who can drive a lorry), to help him save the officers' lives by threatening him that he would not let him meet his daughter Amudha the next morning, with the help of a lorry borrowed from Kamatchi, a caterer present at the party. As Kamatchi has navigations of routes and roads, Dilli tells him to come with them as well. Dilli, Bejoy, and Kamatchi together load the unconscious officers into the lorry and try their best to get them to the hospital as soon as possible without any casualties.

"Yes, God, Yes",2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8949056/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After an innocent AOL chat turns racy, a Catholic teenager in the early 2000s discovers masturbation and struggles to suppress her new urges in the face of eternal damnation. It is the fall of 2000. Alice is a sexually inexperienced but curious junior at a strict Midwestern co-ed Catholic high school, where Father Murphy instructs her Morality class that any sexual activity not aimed toward procreation within a heterosexual marriage is a sin, with eternal damnation as punishment. She struggles with accepting her burgeoning feelings of sexual desire after both Father Murphy and her best friend, Laura, cause her to feel ashamed of them.The following Monday, the school is abuzz with a rumor that Alice ""tossed the salad"" of a classmate, Wade, at a party over the weekend. Alice denies this, admitting to not knowing what the phrase means. The rumor reaches Mrs. Veda, who prevents Alice from serving at Mass. Later that day, during the sacrament of reconciliation, Alice confesses venial sins to Father Murphy and receives a light penance of twenty prayers, which she immediately and fervently fulfills in the school chapel, Father Murphy and Mrs. Veda's words about sex echoing in her mind.Alice and Laura both decide to attend the school's next ""Kirkos"" retreat-Alice to return to the path of righteousness, and Laura to be accepted by Nina, a popular senior. When they arrive on the retreat campgrounds, Laura is excited to find that Nina is a retreat leader, while Alice eyes Chris, a hunky senior who is also a retreat leader. Chris is friendly and enthusiastic, and after Alice is assigned to his group, the two begin to bond. That night, while playing on her contraband cell phone, Alice accidentally discovers that she can pleasure herself using her phone's vibrating feature; however, she stops soon after looking at the crucifix hanging in her room.On the second day of the retreat, Alice fakes an injury on a hike to get closer to Chris. Nina confiscates Alice's phone; and, as a punishment, Father Murphy assigns Alice to cleaning duties around the retreat house. Once she is alone, she logs onto an AOL chat room from Father Murphy's office computer to ask what ""tossing salad"" means; before she can find out, the sound of footsteps causes her to hastily shut off the computer and leave. She runs into Nina, who lightheartedly guilts Alice about Alice's presumed sexual encounter with Wade, another instance of Alice's inability to be free of the rumor even while ""on Jesus's time.""On the third day of the retreat, Father Murphy announces his discovery of an explicit chat on his computer; of course, no one claims responsibility. He later pushes Alice to confess to acting on her sexual temptations with Wade, and doesn't believe her insistence that nothing happened. Alice confronts Wade about his complicity in the rumor's spread by failing to deny it, and he leaves without admitting his fault or apologizing. Again on cleaning duty, Alice witnesses Nina kissing, then fellating, another senior leader in the woods; Alice shares this with Laura, who refuses to believe Alice, accuses Alice of breaking into Father Murphy's office, and ends their friendship, calling Alice a ""pervy psycho."" Alice returns to Father Murphy's office and frames Wade for the earlier break-in; while hiding to make her escape, she catches Father Murphy masturbating to a pornographic video saved on his computer. Outside, finding herself alone with Chris, Alice kisses him, but he becomes overwhelmed and runs away. That night, Alice flees the campgrounds and stumbles upon a lesbian bar, where she and the owner, Gina, commiserate about how the fear of damnation can warp an adolescent's development. Gina counsels Alice and gives her a ride back to the retreat, encouraging Alice to look into colleges on the West and East Coasts and finally assuaging Alice's curiosity about what ""tossing salad"" means.On the last day of the retreat, Alice befriends a socially awkward classmate while Father Murphy pulls Wade aside. With Wade on the hook for the explicit chat incident, Laura makes peace with Alice. At a whole-group sharing session, Alice reminds the retreat attendees that everyone is ""hiding stuff"" and implores them to treat each other with honesty and respect, as Jesus wanted.Back at school, Alice reassures a still-uncomfortable Chris that they can just be friends. Returning to reconciliation with Father Murphy, Alice boldly reveals that she saw a video during the retreat of people having sex-both of them knowing, but not discussing, the implications of her confession. Father Murphy assigns a heavier penance of one hundred prayers, but instead of remaining in the chapel, Alice goes home to rewatch and masturbate to the sex scene in Titanic."

Just Mercy,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4916630/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"World-renowned civil rights defense attorneyBryan Stevensonworks to free a wrongly condemned death row prisoner. A powerful and thought-provoking true-story, ""Just Mercy"" follows young lawyerBryan Stevenson(Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryan might have had his pick of lucrative jobs. Instead, he heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned, with the support of local advocate Eva Ansley (Larson). One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence and the fact that the only testimony against him came from a criminal with a motive to lie. In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiled in a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights for Walter, and others like him, with the odds - and the system - stacked against them.—Gregg Brilliant After graduating from Harvard,Bryan Stevensonheads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned or those not afforded proper representation. One of his first cases is that of Walter McMillian, who is sentenced to die in 1987 for the murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite evidence proving his innocence. In the years that follow, Stevenson encounters racism and legal and political maneuverings as he tirelessly fights for McMillian's life.—yusufpiskin In 1989, idealistic young Harvard law graduate Bryan Stevenson travels to Alabama hoping to help fight for poor people who cannot afford proper legal representation. Teaming with Eva Ansley, he founds the Equal Justice Initiative, then travels to a prison to meet its death row inmates. He meets Walter ""Johnny D."" McMillian, an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison, a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers, who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.Stevenson's first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson's notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian's family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers' testimony the day of the murder, which would cause the prosecution's case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston's testimony, police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed, Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court. Shortly afterwards, Stevenson is intimidated by two sheriff deputies who remove him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over and let him go.Stevenson then approaches Myers himself, who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand, but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught, Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on 60 Minutes to rally public support in favor of McMillian, and then appeals to the Supreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court's decision, and grants McMillian his retrial. Stevenson then moves to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes, and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion, the case is dismissed, and McMillian is finally reunited with his family.An epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013, McMillian remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison's death confirmed McMillian's innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved. McMillian's former cellmate, Anthony Ray Hinton, remained on death row for 28 years until Stevenson was able to have all charges dropped and Hinton was eventually released in 2015."
Togo,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5116302/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The story of Togo, the sled dog who led the 1925 serum run despite being considered too small and weak to lead such an intense race. The historical film by the American director Ericson Core, which is dedicated to the events of the Great Mercy Race of 1925. The events of the film unfold around the drover Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo, who went together the longest leg in the relay.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) The film flashes between musher Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) raising his dog Togo and the 1925 serum run to Nome.
In 1913, Seppala and his wife Constance (Julianne Nicholson) welcome a newborn Siberian Husky pup. While Seppala insists on immediately retiring him due to his small and weak state, Constance convinces him to raise him with the rest. The puppy Husky turns out to be a handful as he constantly escapes the kennel to usurp Seppala's dog team while he is out training them. After trying to get rid of the Husky twice, Seppala decides to have him run with the others where, to his astonishment, he discovers that he is energetic enough to outrun the other dogs. He decides to call him Togo (Diesel), after admiral Togo Heihachiro, and fully trains him to the point where he successfully wins the All Alaska Sweepstakes, earning both Togo and himself some local fame.In 1925, a diphtheria outbreak occurs; mostly affecting children. Mayor George Maynard (Christopher Heyerdahl) plans to have the serum flown in from Nenana, but this proves to be impossible due to the severity of the weather. Eventually, Seppala is convinced to take Togo and the other dogs to collect the serum and race back despite the raging biblical storm. Constance becomes concerned due to Togo being 12-years-old (old for dog age), but Seppala insists on going. Seppala and his team tread through stormy weather and take a break at an outpost where a local doctor named Atiqtalik (Nive Nielsen) tells him that Togo is tired. Seppala continues on for miles; taking a dangerous shortcut across the now frozen Norton Sound.Unknown the Seppala, the Nome town mayor had organized a relay from Nenana and the hope was that the incoming relay would connect with Seppala at the Atiqtalik cottage, which was a commonly known break point. But Constance was sure that Seppala had taken the Norton Sound shortcut, and that had reduced the odds of a rendezvous.Eventually, Seppala meets up with the fellow musher from Nenana, Henry Ivanov (Brandon Oakes), who was bringing the serum and he is able to leave back for Nome the next day. Seppala and his team head across the Sound again where he is forced to have Togo pull a piece of ice that they are stuck on as the Norton Sound begins to crack apart. Reuniting with Atiqtalik, she tells him Togo is dying. Nevertheless, Seppala gets his team back to Joe Dexter's outpost as he, Togo and team recuperate. The serum is passed off to fellow musher Gunnar Kaasen (Shaun Benson) who arrives back in Nome. A reporter, confusing him for being the sole musher, announces his dog Balto as the hero who saved Nome, disappointing Constance.Seppala returns to Nome later, where the entire town come to his house to celebrate Togo's success. Seppala later becomes upset when a cured girl named Sally (Madeline Wickins) deduces that Togo is dying. Seppala intends to continue training his dogs without Togo (who gained a small injury during the run), but he refuses to stop and chases down Seppala who welcomes him with open arms. Over the next two years, Togo welcomes puppies of his own that prove to be famous in their own right. Togo eventually passes away in 1929 with Seppala continuing to train dogs. A title card at the end reveals that while Balto had received a statue in his honor in NYC, Togo is remembered for making the longest run and for being the true hero of Nome.
20 teams ran the serum run of 1925. 19 teams ran an average of 31 miles each. 1 team ran 264 miles."

From acclaimed director Trey Edward Shults, Waves is a heartrending story about the universal capacity for compassion and growth even in the darkest of times. Tyler Williams is a popular high school senior on the wrestling team. Outside of school, he parties with his friends and spends time with his girlfriend, Alexis Lopez, but is routinely pushed by his domineering father Ronald both physically and mentally to be better. His stepmother Catharine is more understanding of Tyler's pressures and tries her best to connect with him. Unbeknownst to anyone at school or home, Tyler suffers from a SLAP tear which he keeps secret from his family and team by stealing Ronald's painkillers. Tyler sees a doctor about this, who warns him of the severity of his injury and highly recommends undergoing surgery before it's too late. Unwilling to postpone the remainder of his season, Tyler continues to wrestle competitively until he is thrown onto his shoulder during a match, causing irreparable damage to his shoulder and ending his season, as well as his career.One night, Tyler gets a text from Alexis, who reveals that her period is late. He takes her to get an abortion, but when confronted by pro-life protesters outside the clinic, Alexis contemplates bringing the child to term. This leads to a heated argument between her and Tyler, who objects to wanting to be a father at their age and in his condition.

Sea Fever,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2716382/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The crew of a West of Ireland trawler, marooned at sea, struggle for their lives against a growing parasite in their water supply. Siobhan, a scientist studying fauna behavioral patterns, purchases a place on the fishing trawler the Niamh Cinn-Oir, manned by a crew of six: skipper Gerard, his wife Freya, ship's engineer Omid, Johnny, Ciara, and Sudi. As they set off, they are warned by the Coast Guard that there is an exclusion zone near their route, which Gerard, unbeknownst to the others, takes them into. As they travel through the zone, they run into an unknown, shoal-like object which stops the boat. Meanwhile Omid discovers strange breaches in the hull which protrude a blue-green slime. The crew suspects barnacles, and as Siobhan possesses the only diving gear on-board, Gerard sends her armed with a knife to cut the boat free. Underwater, she discovers tendril-like appendages of an enormous organism adhering to the boat. Thinking it may be a newly-discovered form of giant squid, the crew attempt to capture it with their net, but it proves too heavy. While releasing the net, Johnny cuts his hand on the rope.Seeing another boat nearby, Gerard, Johnny, and Siobhan board it using a rowboat, only to discover the entire crew dead from suicide inside the cabin, with one of the men having his eyes ostensibly scooped out. They return, with Gerard instructing the others not to speak of it, calling it ""sea fever"" and insisting the other crew merely went mad. That night, Johnny begins to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior, including wanting to go for a swim. Suspecting a fever, Siobhan performs a medical diagnosis on him and discovers movement in his retinas. As he is washing his face, he suddenly goes blind and his eyes burst, releasing minuscule organisms. Siobhan realizes they are parasites that were attempting to go into the water, and the crew rushes to save Sudi, who is taking a shower. Sudi suffers numerous cuts over his body as the waterborne creatures bite him, and Johnny dies from his injuries.Siobhan theorizes that the underwater creature, mistaking the trawler for a whale, latched onto the boat to inject its larvae in the form of the slime. Johnny, who had a cut on his hand, was infected by the parasitic creatures, and the rest of the crew are also at risk. The crew check their water filtration system and find that their entire water supply has been contaminated. As the creatures are a hadopelagic (below the abyssopelagic layer) species, Siobhan theorizes intense UV light may harm it and they attempt to use it to kill the microscopic eggs in the slime. When that fails, they instead electrocute the trawler using the ship's arc welder, successfully sterilizing the boat and preventing further infection. However, this does not preclude the chance that they may have already been infected, and Siobhan insists they self-quarantine on the trawler for a further 36 hours before returning to shore. When Sudi dies from the infection, Siobhan disables the trawler by entangling the propeller.The crew diagnose themselves by checking their eyes for the parasites, and Siobhan, Omid, Freya, and Ciara ostensibly check out. Gerard however, is proven to be infected, and after a heartfelt goodbye Freya mercy kills him by slicing his throat. Ciara goes insane and attacks Siobhan, only to fall to her death. As she dies, a parasite emerges from her eye, revealing her to have been infected. Now with only Freya, Siobhan, and Omid remaining, Freya decides to take the rowboat to shore to double their chances of being found. Siobhan and Omid discover that the mass of larvae in the ship's water tank have instead now been replaced by a single cannibal creature, which eats through the ship's hull to return to the ocean, causing the trawler to take water and sink. They use spirits to ignite a fire on the Niamh Cinn-Oir and then abandon it on the inflatable boat, but Omid falls overboard and is seized by the adult creature. Siobhan rescues him, but cuts her bare hand on the creature's tendril, becoming infected. As a rescue helicopter approaches, Siobhan dives into the water, swimming towards the bio-luminescent creature."
Pain and Glory,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8291806/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A film director reflects on the choices he's made in life as the past and present come crashing down around him. The protagonist of ""Pain and Glory"" was at the decline of his career. The man involuntarily looks back into the past, and a stream of vivid memories falls upon him. He recalls such moments from his youth as tender feelings for his mother, love and separation, the search for happiness and success. All this leads the master of cinema to important thoughts about life and art, because this is the most important thing for him.—Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) Romantic Salvador Mallo, a filmmaker in the twilight of his career, is plagued by health issues just as SABOR, a film from early in his career, is readied for re-release. As his physical ailments begin to consume his vitality, he is incapacitated by an immense depression that debilitates his creativity. In this desperate state he reconnects to SABOR's leading man, Crespo, from whom he's been estranged for 30 years. Crespo, too, has seen better days and self-medicates between gigs. Tapping into Crespo's 'vacation' routes, pain takes a backseat allowing Salvo to revisit the temperate climes of his past - memories of his loving but emotionally frustrated mother, the purity of his first crush, his greatest muse and lover 'lost' to addiction...grasping for existential relief and closure, creative salvation emerges in the form of a shelved autobiographical script.—Mae Moreno ""Pain and Glory"" follows the life of a film director, Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas), through two main narrative threads. One the one hand, we see ""Salva""'s current life - a depressed artist in his 50s, who's achieved major success in his prime, but now lives a lonely life, lacking in inspiration and abundant in illness. On the other hand, we witness young Salva's youth, where he shares a tender relationship with his mother Jacinta (Penélope Cruz), as she bends backwards to get him an education and a way out of poverty.The narrative oscillates between these two subplots to show us vignettes of Salva's life. We see him ingress in a catholic school where he stands out as a young choir soloist, while in present life, he reconnects with Alberto Crespo (Asier Etxeandia), an actor he'd worked with, and with whom he hadn't spoken for 32 years.This rekindled relationship introduces Salva to heroin, a newfound blessing that can finally cure all of his migraines and back torments. One time, while Salva is dozing off high, Alberto goes through his computer and finds ""Adicción"" - a deeply personal text where the Director confesses his experiences during a three year relationship with ""Marcelo"", the love of his life and also a heroin addict.Meanwhile, back in the past, Salva and his family move to a new village in search of a better life, but end up living in a cave with less than ideal conditions. The 9-year-old Salva befriends Eduardo (César Vicente), a twenty-something village worker who agrees to work on the cave's walls in exchange for reading and writing classes with the young prodigy.In the present, Salva offends Alberto by revealing his opinion of his skills as an actor - and to win him back, he has no other option but to give him the rights to ""Adicción"". Alberto immediately puts together a play where he delivers the monologue with vibrant passion. One night, one of the audience members is visibly distraught - he is Federico, the ""Marcelo"" of ""Adicción"", and Salva's life love. Through Alberto, the two reconnect and spend an entire night catching up and finding a more appropriate ending to their story, making Salva decisive on quitting his recent heroin habit.This catharsis helps Salva free himself of some of his depression, but he still suffers from chronic back pain and constant choking - something that makes Mercedes (Nora Navas), his competent assistant and probable secret lover, quite worried. In addition, we learn that Salva is still not over the recent passing of his Mother, whom he loved dearly despite her less-than-appreciative attitude towards his unconditional love and life achievements.Back in the 50s, Salva and Eduardo grow closer as the latter makes progress, and one time he draws the young boy's portrait. That afternoon, after finishing Jacinta's tile wall, Eduardo undresses to wash off his body - and the sight of his nudity, combined with the ardent heat, causes young Salva to faint.Towards the end, the two narratives finally come together. After putting away his story with Federico, Salva decides to visit a doctor and get his life back on track. He finds a mass in his throat that must be removed with surgery. Meanwhile, Mercedes discovers an art exhibition where Eduardo's portrait of the young Salva is being sold. Salva purchases it from the dealer, and discovers a sweet inscription, revealing of the boys' connection.This discovery is the ultimate riddance Salva was seeking, as he finds new inspiration to start writing ""The First Desire"". In the end, we realize that the whole 50s storyline wasn't set in the past, but actually in the future - it was the film set of Salva's homonym film, where he finally finds closure through the relived wonder of his childhood and his connection with Eduardo."

Thirty years after starring inThe Wizard of Oz (1939), beloved actress and singerJudy Garland(Renée Zellweger) arrives in London, England to perform sold-out shows at the Talk of the Town nightclub. While there, she reminisces with friends and fans and begins a whirlwind romance with musicianMickey Deans(Finn Wittrock), her soon-to-be fifth husband.—Jwelch5742 In 1968, with her otherwise brilliant career of soaring highs and plummeting lows taking a gradual descent since her golden era atLouis B. Mayer's Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, the universally loved American actress, singer and dancer,Judy Garland, finds herself with her back to the wall. As a result, nearly three long decades after her iconic role as ""Dorothy"" inThe Wizard of Oz (1939), the exhausted and struggling single mum,Judy Garland, tentatively accepts the invitation of the London impresario,Bernard Delfont, to perform a five-week-long series of concerts at the Talk of the Town nightclub.

Is there a magical land somewhere over the rainbow?—Nick Riganas The film opens with a younger Judy Garland (Darci Shaw) on the set of 'THE WIZARD OF OZ' in 1939. She is following the MGM studio manager, Louis B Mayer around. Louis tells Judy that there are plenty of girls out there that are prettier than her, but that she has something that they do not have...the ability that her voice has to reach someone's heart. However, if she wants to live a life like all the other girls do and work in a restaurant or be a stay at home mom, then she could walk right out the door with no strings attached.Judy apologizes profusely for her desire to be ""normal"" and that perhaps a chance to go out to the theater once in a while to see a movie with others would help. Louis scoffs and notes that if that is the case, then they could just bring in Shirley Temple for the film, instead. They reach the musical director, and they start the opening chords to ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow.""The scene dissolves to 1968, where we see Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger) much older and with her two youngest children, Lorna Luff and Joey Luff. She is dressing Joey and commenting that he needs to stop growing because it costs her a new set of pants every time. They are wrapping up a series of concerts at New York's Palace Theater where she is given an envelope of $150. A sum recognized as not what she was hoping for, but it is better than nothing.After the concert, Judy and her children head back to the hotel to sleep only to find that their room was released due to non-payments. Realizing that her children were tired and hungry, she resigns to take them to their father's home, her third ex-husband, Sidney Luft (Rufus Sewell).At Luft's home, Sid and Judy argue about what is best for the children. Judy, as their mother, expects them to be with her. Sid explains that what the children need is stability. And emphasizes that the children may stay with him, but that she is not welcome to stay the night. Judy leaves Sid's home and heads to her eldest daughter: Liza Minnelli (Gemma-Leah Devereux).It is at a party that Judy meets with her daughter, Liza, and finds out that Liza will be opening a show in a couple of days. After Liza confirming that she is excited and not nervous, a friend of Liza's pull her away to the dance floor, and Judy meets Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock).Mickey Deans enchants Judy enough that she turns down an invitation from her daughter to go to another party, and instead sticks around and stays up till morning with Mickey joking and chatting.There is a flashback to the teenage Judy and she is having lunch with Mickey Rooney in Hollywood. Mickey convinces her to eat a fry, and with much hesitation, she does. She jokes that they have to tie her hands to the chair to prevent her from eating more, and she would have to eat the fries with just her mouth. She then asks Mickey ""are we on a date?"" to which he replies that they have to ask permission from the studio head, he just thinks of Judy as a really good friend. As Mickey starts to take a bite from his burger, Judy playfully steals it and almost takes a bite of it only to be stopped by a studio minder who reminds her of her diet. Judy complains of being hungry, wherein the studio minder gives her a couple of pills and tells her to ""take those, they will stave off the hunger"" to which Judy complies. The camera pans out, and you see the moment as if it was in a movie scene surrounded by camera, press, and those behind the camera.We switch back to the ""present day,"" and Judy's manager explains that without money in the bank, she is unable to provide and support her children. He then suggests that if she went to London, she would be greeted with open arms. Judy argues that she has to stay in the states with her kids, but is confronted with the reality of her situation.Judy takes a taxi to Sidney Luft's home and has a talk with her children, explaining that she has to leave for London to make money so she can buy a home for the three of them to stay in forever. Joey is upset and goes into his room, with Judy and his sister Lorna following. Judy takes his stuffed toy and suggests that she stays there with them because she wants to stay there with them. Judy then goes into the clothing cabinet and closes the door, pretending it to be a roomy home that they could all stay in (but still visibly upset with the situation). Eventually, she invites her children in with her, and they all fit in the clothing cabinet. They have a group hug with her saying, confirming that ""this is where I belong.""Judy is in the backseat of a car heading to the hotel where she meets her minder, Rosalyn (Jesse Buckley), that takes her to her room with her upcoming schedule for the upcoming week. Judy dismisses her and attempts to make the most of her situation. During the next days, Rosalyn picks her up, and they go to the rehearsal hall, even though it isn't where she would be singing, the minder admits that the acoustics are amazing. There Judy meets her bandleader, Burt, who profusely admits his admiration of her, and goes to start rehearsing, except Judy complains of the dampness of the area. She walks around the rehearsal space as they talk about the location of the band and the audience, and decides that she cannot rehearse that day and needs rest. Burt asks about the set-list, and she states that it hasn't changed from what she has done in the past and that it will be fine, despite opening night being the next day, and leaves. Judy spends the remainder of the day trying to reach her children, to no avail, and is unable to sleep. She walks just outside of her hotel at 3:00 am and is sent warm milk as a way to try to fall asleep.Opening Night....Rosalyn realizes that Judy is late to the performance and hunts her down in her hotel room and finds her sitting in the bathroom. The minder and makeup artist dress her up and rush her back to the concert hall and push Judy onstage, despite her complaints of not feeling well. Judy appears to ""click"" into stage form and has an excellent opening night performance. After the show, Rosalyn finds Judy exhausted and crying, and tries to help clean her up so that she might go home and rest. Judy thanks her and says that she will meet her outside. Starting her concert stay in London.During the above, there were two flashbacks scenes:The first is teenager Judy taking pills in an attempt to go to sleep as she is unable to sleep.In the second, we find her on a prop couch where the studio minder finds her, and Judy complains that she is unable to sleep anymore, why can't she sleep? The studio minder takes her to another set where MGM is celebrating a ""Judy turns 16"" party even though her birthday is not for another couple of months. It is a beach/summer-themed party with a tank set up as a pool. The studio minder instructs Judy to cut the cake, but to fake eating the cake as she is not allowed. Judy starts to argue back, saying that her contract guarantees her one hour a day for lunch and that she would like that one hour for lunch, to which the studio minder says, ""no one ever does that."" As the cameras prepare to roll, the studio minder reminds Judy not to get her hair wet, to which Judy walks to the edge of the pool, pulls off her dress and jumps in. The camera follows her underwater, and we see her with a smile on her face.After a slew of relatively successful shows to follow the successful Opening Night, we come to the holiday season. We see Judy in her dressing room, Rosalyn asks if she needs anything and Judy says that she'll be fine. Judy asks if there is anyone at the stage door? Rosalyn says that she doesn't know, and Judy wishes her goodbye.Judy heads to the stage door and meets two male fans who have loved her for years. They mention that they missed her show in 1964 and decided to see as many of Judy's shows as possible during her current stay in London. After a bit of small talk, Judy asks them if they would like to hang out with her for dinner. The fans, in shock and thrilled, take her around London only to find that everywhere they went was closed. So instead they invite her to their flat, and she accepts.At the fans' flat, they started to make omelets, except one of the fans, added cream ""to make it better,"" and you find Judy comfortable in their presence. Later in the evening, one fan falls asleep on the couch, while Judy and the other. Play a card game and continue to talk about how difficult it is to be themselves in the current world. After a bit, the fan goes to the piano and starts to play ""Get Happy,"" to which Judy sings. Before the end of the song, the fan slowly starts to break down and stops altogether and cries. Judy goes to him and gives him a hug from behind and notices through photos that the two fans are a gay couple, and are also massive fans of Judy Garland.Scene changes to Judy walking alone down a street... then cuts to Judy sleeping for the first time in who knows when but is suddenly interrupted by incessant knocking. Judy opens the door and is about to chew the bellboy out for bringing her room service on a day that she didn't ask for any and that for once, she can sleep, who then whispers that ""there is someone underneath the trolley."" Out from underneath is Mickey Deans, who has come to surprise Judy.It turns out Mickey Deans purchased a one-way ticket to London to visit Judy with no plans for anything else, as he came straight to the hotel from the plane, and Judy invites him to stay with her.Judy has an interview where the interviewer attempts to needle more into her private affairs and her life working and growing up with MGM, to which Judy is very defensive. Which triggers her anxiety and causes her to run late in starting her show later that evening. Rosalyn gets her on stage, where the audience begins to heckle and throw food at her. As Judy attempts to sing, you see that she is unwell, and eventually, she collapses on stage. The scene cuts to Judy on the floor of the bathroom, and Mickey Deans waxing poetic about the world treating people like them as objects, and no one knows them as they know them.We flashback to after Judy jumped into the pool. The studio minder directs the costume and makeup staff that she wants Judy ready and sober dry within five minutes only to be stopped by Louis B Mayer, who dismisses the women and instructs Judy to enter a prop shed. Louis closes the doors and reminds Judy that she is Frances Gum, her father is a faggot, and her mother only cares what he cares about Judy. If Judy wanted to swim in a pool, she is welcome to his pool anytime and reminds her that he created her, he can break her as well. Judy apologizes for her actions and attempts to make amends by stating how much she has been working, and she was looking for a small break. But Louis insinuates that if she feels that a break is needed, he could find anyone else to do what she does, and he chose her. Louis walks to Judy and places two fingers at her chest to emphasize his point. Judy understands the insinuation and apologizes again, to which Louis leaves, saying, ""don't ever hold up a movie of mine.""Back in the present day, Judy is talking to the London concert manager, Bernard Delfont, apologizing for her previous behavior and asks for forgiveness, to which he says ""already forgotten"" and that ""had I know you weren't well I wouldn't have asked you to do the show."" The Bernard then says that he wants her to visit the doctor who will inject her with medication to aid with her strength.Judy is at the doctor's office, whom the doctor is a fan. He finds out that Judy had a tracheotomy two years previous, which weakened her vocal cords. The doctor talks about how, in his youth, he adored Dorothy Gale, to which Judy notes that most boys were attracted to the pigtails. The doctor disagrees and notes that it was how Dorothy took care of Toto that endeared him to the character. Looking at Judy, the doctor says that she needs to take care of herself and leaves.Judy and Mickey are walking in London, much closer and comfortable with one another. Mickey explains that there is a deal that he is working on where someone he knows is planning to open a series of movie theaters calling them the ""Judy Garland Theater"" and that he going to push to try to have Judy 10% of the profits so that she could purchase the home she always wanted for herself and the children. This would also allow her to no longer have to tour to live. Thrilled, Judy admits that she feels comfortable around Mickey, and they have a connection. Mickey agrees, to which Judy proposes that they marry, much to Mickey's surprise and shock. Eventually, he agrees, and they are married soon after.There is a montage of shows where Judy is singing better than ever overlaid with scenes of:Judy and Mickey's marriage, Rosalyn and Burt surprising the newlyweds with a firework show in their honor.Mickey on the phone eyeing the younger dancers, whilst trying to convince his connection to hold on the deal until he makes it back to the states.Mickey talking to his connections about the deal he previously mentioned to Judy.Judy is resting in her hotel room, and knocking is heard. Assuming it was Mickey, she opens the door happily only to comes face to face with Sidney Luft, who asks her to go out for a couple of drinks. At a pub later, Sid attempts at small talk in regards to her time in London and the show, which leads to his belief that the kids need stability. However, Judy disagrees and explains that she is doing all she can so she could provide that stable life for her kids because she wants them to be as ""far away from this phony business"" as possible. Sid finally admits that it is the children that wanted to stay where they are, that they do love and miss their mother, but they also want stability. This revelation causes Judy to bite back at Sidney and leave the pub to the hotel room.Once Judy enters, she sees Mickey's briefcase and is instantly calmed that he has returned. However, Mickey doesn't return Judy's enthusiasm attempting to explain to her that people still consider her unreliable and difficult to work with and ergo because of that reputation he is unable to close the deal. This upsets Judy so much that she accuses Mickey to be no different than all the other men in her life that sit at the sidelines as she is singing in concerts and assume that is work. Mickey bites back, saying that if she stayed off the drugs and was more consistent in her work ethic, he would have been able to close the deal. This causes Judy to leave the hotel room in anger and heads to her show.At the concert, Judy's anger takes over and that in combination with the heckling from the audience is forced off the stage, to be replaced by the backup act: Lonnie Donegan. Judy wanders aimlessly through the streets of London and comes across a phone booth. She puts in a few coins and connects with her children. Judy talks to her daughter, Lorna, who admits that they miss her, but they do like being able to go to school, and not having to move all the time. Lorna then asks if her mom would be OK, and Judy thru her sadness, says that she'll be fine, and says that she loves them both, before hanging up.The next day, Judy has packed up all her belongings and is ready to leave. Her concert series, having abruptly ended Rosalyn explains they have one more surprise for her. In the restaurant at the hotel, they are joined by Burt, and a cake arrives for Judy. Rosalyn cuts the cake and gives Judy a slice. As the other two start to eat the cake, Judy stares at her piece. Eventually, she eats a piece of it and admits that it was good, and continues to eat another piece. After admitting that there isn't anything lined up for her yet, Judy asks Rosalyn if it would be possible to see the show of her backup act.Flashback and a younger Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland just got offstage in joy. Mickey suggests that they leave and enjoy the evening, but the continuous applause catches Judy's attention. After a little back and forth, Judy turns down Mickey's invitation and stays to listen to the applause.Back in the present day, Rosalyn and Judy are backstage, Rosalyn asks if Judy will be OK, and Judy admits that she'll be fine. Rosalyn leaves to sit in the house, and Judy sees Lonnie prepping to be onstage. In the meantime, the couple we met earlier is at the ticket booth demanding a refund on their tickets because they came to see Judy Garland only to find that she is no longer performing. Cutting back to the backstage, Lonnie and Judy greet, and Judy wishes Lonnie luck in his act, but after a moment, asks if she could have just one last song with the audience to make up for the disastrous night before. After a few moments, Lonnie agrees, and Judy goes onstage and tells Burt to pick a song. Judy sings ""San Francisco,"" which catches the attention of the couple outside, forcing them to run to their seats, and ends in rousing applause.Judy starts to leave the stage only to find she loves it too much and admits she might have one more song left in her. She talks about the song and how people seem to equate it to being a destination, but she sees the song is being about the journey and the steps one takes during that journey. She sits at the end of the stage, closest to the audience and begins to sing ""Over the Rainbow."" As she nears the end, she breaks down, unable to finish the song.The couple then stands and starts to sing the chorus of ""Over the Rainbow,"" triggering the rest of the audience to do the same. Judy stands and smiles, relishing in the audience's love and asks into the microphone, ""You won't forget me, will you? Promise you won't."""
Bad Education,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8206668/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The beloved superintendent of New York's Roslyn school district and his staff, friends and relatives become the prime suspects in the unfolding of the single largest public school embezzlement scandal in American history. A Long Island school superintendent and his assistant are credited with bringing the district unprecedented prestige. Frank is a master of positive messaging, whether before an audience of community leaders or in an office with a concerned student or parent. That changes when a student reporter uncovers an embezzlement scheme of epic proportions, prompting Frank to devise an elaborate cover-up. In 2002, Dr. Frank Tassone (Hugh Jackman) is the superintendent of Roslyn School District in Long Island, which oversees Roslyn High School. Frank, along with his assistant superintendent Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney), have overseen major improvements in the district, becoming the 4th ranked public school in the country. The school's performance in turn stimulates the local economy, including for school board head and real estate broker Bob Spicer (Ray Romano). Frank is beloved by students and parents, and sought after by women; Frank claims to have lost his wife several years ago, but is in fact a gay man. While attending a conference in Las Vegas, Frank begins a relationship with former Roslyn student Kyle Contreras (Rafael Casal).While writing an article for the Roslyn school paper about a sky-walk the school is planning to construct, student Rachel Bhargava (Geraldine Viswanathan) begins to discover discrepancies in the school district's finances. Unbeknownst to anyone at the school, Frank and Pam are co-conspirators in a massive embezzlement scheme, defrauding the school district for millions of dollars. Pam's part in the scheme is discovered when her son Jimmy (Jimmy Tatro) uses a Roslyn expense card to purchase building materials for Pam's home renovations; the purchases are noticed by a relative of Bob, who alerts him to the purchases.The next day, Pam is confronted about her actions. In an effort to cover up his part in the scheme, Frank convinces the school board to conceal the embezzlement from the public and from law enforcement (as this will affect the school ranking, the future budget and most importantly the real estate prices in the area). He also convinces Phil Metzger (Jeremy Shamos), the district's auditor, to estimate the amount stolen at around $250,000, despite the actual amount possibly being far higher. Pam is fired from her job, but given the opportunity to resign quietly and make restitution rather than having her misdeeds exposed. Frank also transfers Pam's niece Jenny (Annaleigh Ashford), who works for the district, into a 'special utilities' role, threatening to expose her own misuse of district funds.Meanwhile, Rachel begins to uncover evidence of the embezzlement in the form of supply orders that were never fulfilled and consulting fees paid to unknown companies. She travels to Manhattan to investigate one of these unknown companies. When she arrives at the registered address she finds it is not an office but an apartment building. As she is leaving the building, she spots Frank entering the same apartment; the two see each other, but Rachel quickly leaves. The apartment in fact belongs to Tom Tuggiero (Stephen Spinella), Frank's long-time partner; Tom is also the registered owner of the fraudulent company.
Frank meets with Rachel and warns her of the potential fallout for exposing the story. Phil confronts Frank about more illegitimate expenses, including first class airline tickets for Frank and Kyle. Frank threatens to expose Phil's failure to catch the original embezzlement, who agrees to maintain the cover-up, but it is too late - Rachel's story is published in the school paper, implicating Frank as the key figure in the scheme. Frank defends himself to Bob, saying that he had the school's best interests at heart.Frank pleads with Bob not to expose the board's failure to report Pam's original embezzlement until the school budget is approved, but is unsuccessful. The investigation becomes a criminal matter; Pam, Jenny, and Phil are all arrested. After the authorities threaten to prosecute her husband and children, Pam agrees to testify against Frank and turns over evidence of the scheme. Tom is informed by the authorities about Frank's infidelity with Kyle. Frank resigns as superintendent and flees to Nevada with tens of thousands of dollars in cash, staying with Kyle at a house Frank bought for him. Eventually, police arrive and arrest Frank, and he returns to New York, where he is sentenced to prison. While in prison, Frank fantasizes about being back at Roslyn, where he is being congratulated for bringing the school to being ranked #1 in the country.
An epilogue reveals that Frank was convicted of embezzling $2.2 million and sentenced to 4-12 years in prison. Pam, who plead guilty to embezzling $4.3 million and testified against Frank, was sentenced to 3-9 years in prison. However, due to an oversight in the state pension fund, Frank will still receive over $173,000 per year."

The undercover team carrying out this mission is led by the charismatic Ari Kidron and courageous local Kabede Bimro.—Netflix Kebede Bimro, an Ethiopian Jew, works with the Israeli Mossad agent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles.

The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him.Shortly after the team's arrival in the Islamic country of Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast.

As her husband and his family tighten their control over her life, she must confront the dark secret behind her new obsession. Against the backdrop of insufferable domestic ennui, the soft-spoken former saleswoman and newlywed housewife, Hunter, is struggling to stretch the bars of her gilded cage, a lavish and immaculate modernist villa in New York, even though she seems to have it all. But, more and more, as sad Hunter tries, unsuccessfully, to meet her controlling family's expectations, compliance turns into submission, obedience transforms into obsession, and pica, a compulsive eating disorder, starts to take over. Now, swallowing non-nutritive objects and engaging in increasingly impossible tasks becomes Hunter's dangerous newfound addiction, and there's no telling how far she'll go to maintain a false and fleeting sense of power. Who can save Hunter from herself?—Nick Riganas Hunter, a young woman from a lower-working-class family, has recently married Richie, a man from a wealthy family who is set to take over as CEO of his father's Manhattan corporation. This affords Hunter the ability to stay at home in the couple's lavish upstate New York home. Despite this, Hunter finds herself emotionally stifled and isolated in both her marriage and domestic life, while Richie is distant and inconsiderate toward her. For example, at a dinner with Richie's parents to congratulate the young couple on their pregnancy, Hunter is enticed to tell a story, only to be interrupted by her father-in-law zoning out and asking Richie about business.

After undergoing surgery to remove the screwdriver, Michael and Katherine arrange to have Hunter committed to a psychiatric hospital for the next seven months until she delivers the baby, threatening that Richie will divorce her. Luay, who has warmed to Hunter, allows her to flee into the woods, and stages it to appear as though she had escaped.Hunter hitchhikes to a motel and calls Richie, who begs her to return.

But their unique bond is threatened when an inexplicable stranger arrives with alarming news. In the near future, an extinction level event rocks planet Earth, and an underground bunker is activated. Its program is designed to repopulate the Earth. A robot, called Mother (voiced by Rose Byrne), initiates her program and grows a human embryo into a baby, which it then raises into childhood.

Once there, she hears a Woman (Hilary Swank) wounded badly from a gunshot and crying out for help from outside. Daughter opens the lock, gets the Woman to put on a hazmat suit, and leaves her hidden in the airlock as Mother quickly arrives.

Woman tells Daughter she should go with her, but Mother interrupts and tells Daughter to take her exam.

Her courage, ingenuity, and tenacity freed hundreds of slaves and changed the course of history.—Focus Features In 1840s Maryland, a slave state, Araminta ""Minty"" Ross (Cynthia Erivo) is newly married to a freedman, John Tubman (Zackary Momoh), but still a slave herself on the Brodess farm, along with her mother and sister, while two other sisters had been sold to another slave owner in the South. Her father, also a freedman, approaches Mr. Brodess about her freedom, as Brodess's own great-grandfather had agreed to free Minty's mother, Harriet ""Rit"" Ross, and her family when she turned 45. Even though Rit is now 57, Mr. Brodess insists they will always be slaves, and tears up the letter from a lawyer John had hired. Brodess's adult son Gideon (Joe Alwyn) catches Minty praying for God to take Mr. Brodess and mocks her, saying God does not care about the prayers of slaves. Mr. Brodess dies shortly afterward, alarming Gideon, who decides to sell Minty as punishment. Minty, who suffers ""spells"" since being struck in the head as a girl, has a vision of herself escaping to freedom, and she decides to run.Minty tells John to stay behind, as he would lose his own freedom if caught escaping with her, but plans to meet up with him later. Gideon pursues her to a bridge over a river, where he promises not to sell her, but she jumps anyway, saying she will live free or die. Minty is presumed drowned but successfully makes it to Philadelphia via the Underground Railroad assisted by Quakers and other abolitionists. In Philadelphia, she meets Marie Buchanon (Janelle Monáe), the fashionable daughter of a freed slave who was born free and is now a boarding-house proprietor, and William Still (Leslie Odom Jr.), an abolitionist and writer. William encourages her to take a new free name, and she calls herself Harriet after her mother.

Harriet has managed to free many of her family and friends, yet still yearns to free her own sister from the Brodess household. William forbids it, saying it is too dangerous.
However, when the Fugitive Slave Act passes, the escaped slaves are in jeopardy of being brought back even from free states. Gideon is livid when he discovers that she is ""Moses"" as his fellow slave owners demand he compensate them Harriet freeing their own slaves. Gideon pursues her to Philadelphia along with the slave hunter Bigger Long (Omar Dorsey), who kills Marie. Harriet flees to Canada.In Canada, Harriet insists that the Underground Railroad must continue. She continues to help runaway slaves flee all the way to Canada, though her sister dies before she can save her. Over time, the Brodess farm falls into financial ruin. Mrs. Brodess (Jennifer Nettles) vows to catch Harriet, using her sister's children as bait. But Harriet's team overwhelms Gideon's siblings and retrieves the last remaining Brodess slaves. In a final confrontation, Bigger Long winds up shot to death, but Harriet lets Gideon live, telling him of her vision of Gideon's cause defeated by war.
An epilogue states she personally freed more than 70 slaves on the Underground Railroad and returned as a Union spy during the Civil War, leading 150 colored soldiers, who freed over 750 slaves."

Lionel, who has Tourette's Syndrome, decides to investigate the reason why his mentor and friend Minna was murdered and he finds a web of treason, secrets and powerful men behind the Construction Code in New York.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Set some year in the 1950s in New York City, Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) owns and works a detective agency alongside Gilbert Coney (Ethan Suplee), Danny Fantl (Dallas Roberts), and Tony Vermonte (Bobby Cannavale). Their boss, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis), found them when they were being raised in the orphanages and rescued them, and now they all work for him. Lionel is kind and smart, but also plagued by Tourette's syndrome which makes him seem strange and as such he leads a fairly isolated life. But alongside his Tourette's also come things like perfect recall and memory which make him good at detective work.Frank has been at work on a secret job and is taking a big, secret meeting for it - he asks Lionel and Gilbert to shadow him in case it goes south. Lionel listens over the phone as Frank presents some important information that is threatening some sort of big deal to a group of men - William Lieberman (Josh Pais), Lou (Fisher Stevens), and an extremely large henchman. They ask Frank where the original copies are, and Frank tries to negotiate a high price for them, so the men drag him out to force him to take them to the originals. Lionel and Gilbert follow in their car, and arrive just in time to see Frank being shot. He tells them he led the goons on a goose chase and made a run for it - they take him to the hospital but it's too late, and Frank dies.Frank's widow Julia (Leslie Mann) leaves Tony in charge of the office. Lionel, determined to find out what Frank was working on and who killed him, begins wearing Frank's hat and coat and starts investigating. He finds a matchbox in Frank's coat pocket and goes to check out an African-American bar. Piecing together a few of the words he heard on the phone call, he realizes that whatever Frank found, it involved Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a young woman working for Gabby Horwitz (Cherry Jones). Gabby and Laura are fighting gentrification in the city - poor and minority neighborhoods are being bought out and demolished and their inhabitants forced out of the city. Lionel goes to a council meeting and sees Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), who the city folk blame for this problem. He's the one in charge of development and built half the parks in New York City. Lionel steals a reporter's credentials and begins asking questions - a man named Paul (Willem Dafoe) who rampaged against Moses in the meeting gives Lionel some tips.Lionel follows Laura and under the guise of reporting on the gentrification story gets to know her and about the situation. She takes him to the club that Frank was looking into and the two have a dance. Her father (Robert Wisdom), assuming that Lionel is one of Randolph's men, has his men beat Lionel unconscious - a trumpet player at the club (Michael K. Williams), rescues Lionel and lets him stay at his apartment.

Meanwhile, Paul, an engineer who is desperately trying to help the city and has been nearly cut off by his unethical brother, presents Moses with a huge renovation plan that will help the city greatly.Lionel gets a call from Laura's father, apologizing for the attack and saying he now knows he was one of Frank's men and he has information for him, but when Lionel goes to meet him at the club, he's been murdered and staged like a suicide. Laura finds him and is distraught, and so Lionel stays the night in her apartment to keep her company. He admits the truth about who he is and that he just wants justice for his friend Frank, and he believes her to be in danger. He tells her that Frank always called him ""Motherless Brooklyn"". When Lionel finds photos of Paul meeting with Laura's father, he confronts her - she explains that her ""Uncle"" Paul is her real father, and that she suspected this but they never told her officially. Lionel goes to Paul, and tells him he suspects that this information somehow is trouble for Moses, and he can't believe that he would put Laura's life in danger. Paul says that he did no such thing, that Frank and Laura's father had the idea to get more money out of Randolph's goons and he told them not to. He begs Lionel to find the evidence.Randolph's goons summon Lionel to meet with Moses. He tells Lionel to join his team and stop snooping, and gives him 24 hours to decide. Lionel eventually puts the pieces together and realizes that inside Frank's hat is the key to a safe deposit box. Inside is the deed to a building, and Laura's birth certificate: Moses is her father, not Paul. He gives the key to Paul and runs into Tony, who has been working for Randolph doing surveillance. They get a drink, and Tony admits he's been sleeping with Julia. He tells Lionel to take the deal, since Laura is about to be killed anyway. Lionel throws hot water in Tony's face and races to save Laura. He stops her just before she enters her apartment, and the two flee and eventually get the upper hand on the assassins: Laura knocks the large one off the fire escape, and Lou corners them with a gun but is hit over the head by the trumpet player, who had witnessed Lionel running in. Lionel has him drive Laura out of town.Lionel meets with Moses, and asks for his side of the story. Moses raped Laura's mother, an employee, and this information threatened to destroy everything. Paul signed off on the birth certificate because he's a man of morals. Moses wants to know what Lionel wants - for him to stop his latest leveling of a poor neighborhood? But Lionel says all his wants is Laura to be left alone, or he will release the information. He also tells him that Lieberman is on the take, and tells Moses that when he takes Lieberman out, to tell him it's for Frank. Moses tells Lionel to tell Paul that his plans are incredible and there's no reason to deny them.The next day, Moses denies Paul's plans anyway out of spite. Lionel drives out to the property that Frank left him in the deed, where Laura is waiting for him."
The Vigil,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10793644/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A man providing overnight watch to a deceased member of his former Orthodox Jewish community finds himself opposite a malevolent entity, in writer-director Keith Thomas' electrifying feature debut. In the Hasidic community of Boro Park, Brooklyn, a despondent young man, short on both faith and funds, reluctantly agrees to assume the responsibility of an overnight shimmer and fulfill the Jewish practice of watching over the body of a deceased member of the Orthodox community. With only the company of the recently departed and an ailing widow who expresses cryptic reservations as to the man's ability to carry out the task, he soon finds himself exposed to a terrifying haunting within the claustrophobic confines of a home that has become host to a malevolent entity. In what is essentially a one-man show, Dave Davis is profoundly affecting in his portrayal of the hesitant sentinel, exuding an empathetic combination of frayed nerves and timid weariness. Throughout this uncanny night, his vigil gradually transforms into a harrowing spiritual investigation of both his cursed surroundings and his pitiable past - a journey in which the very recesses of his community's collective trauma is confronted. By the surreal and unnerving climax, under the assured auspices of writer-director Keith Thomas - making his feature film debut - the plentiful, hair-raising scares give way to poignant catharsis with a specter of dread that is sure to stick with audiences and occupy their subsequent nightmares. Operating within the parameters of a horror sub-genre that more commonly trades in Christian mysticism, The Vigil uniquely unveils a supernatural domain less trodden. It's thrillingly rife with demons, curses, and all the under-your-skin scary stuff that Midnights are made for.—Toronto International Film Festival The film opens with an unidentified boy forced by a man in a black Nazi uniform to shoot a young woman in a forest, as a strange figure approaches them in the background.The film then cuts to Yakov Ronen, a former Jew who is struggling to deal with an unspecified traumatic event in his past, and to pay his rent due to not having a job. He is approached by Reb Shulem, a member of his former Orthodox Jewish community, to keep vigil over Rubin Litvak, a Holocaust survivor who had died recently. Shulem had previously hired a Shomer, but that individual had left due to being ""afraid"", and Ronen had prior experience with keeping vigil. Ronen accepts the job after negotiating a higher fee. That night, Ronen and Shulem meet with Litvak's widow, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and reluctantly accepts Ronen as a Shomer, and Shulem informs Ronen that the mortuary men will arrive in five hours.Ronen begins his vigil when he hears strange noises and sees a shadowy figure in the house's dining room. He finds a photo of Litvak and his family with a similar shadowy figure behind them, before briefly going to sleep; he has a nightmare about his younger brother being tormented by some older men. Upon waking up, Ronen experiences additional strange events, such as the lights flickering while texting his girlfriend Sarah, and finds a video on his phone sent by an unknown number. The video shows Mrs. Litvak approaching Ronen and touching his face while he is asleep; the video file vanishes from his phone a few seconds later.Ronen has a conversation with Mrs. Litvak, who explains that she drove their children away. Ronen then finds a television playing a video recording of Litvak and his wife in the basement; in the recording, Litvak explains that he was haunted by a Mazzik, a malevolent spirit, since his time in Buchenwald, that it latches onto a ""broken person"" and that its true face must be burned by dawn on the first night of its appearance to banish it. The Mazzik appears behind Ronen, and he flees from the basement. Ronen gets a call apparently from his physician, Dr. Kohlberg, and from his dead brother, who asks: ""Why did you let me die?""Ronen leaves the house to get Shulem, though Mrs. Litvak warns him that he has been in the house for too long. However, Ronen experiences severe cramps while walking down the street, and is confronted by the Mazzik. Ronen hastily returns to the house, and falls down the steps after being startled by the Mazzik appearing in front of the door. A flashback then reveals that Ronen's brother was killed in a car accident after escaping from the men who were tormenting him, and Ronen has felt guilty about his death ever since.With Mrs. Litvak's assistance, Ronen confronts the Mazzik, which has shape shifted its true face to look like Ronen's. After initially hesitating, Ronen sets its true face on fire, and then banishes it when it begins to make Litvak's body contort loudly. A flashback reveals that Litvak was the boy forced to shoot the young woman in the opening scene; the pain Litvak felt after the shooting caused the Mazzik to latch on to him.On the next morning, the mortuary men arrive to collect Litvak's body, and Shulem asks Ronen to attend morning prayers with him; Ronen declines his offer, saying ""not today"". As he leaves the house, a dark figure (presumably the Mazzik) is seen following Ronen out of the house and heading down the street behind him.(copied from Wikipedia)"

The mechanic's son, Junior (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), is a fan of them and takes them on a walk around the area. Junior expresses his hatred for cops and claims he is okay with dying that day. In the mechanic's office, Slim takes the chance to call his father. They have one last conversation and tell each other they love one another. It's shown that there were detectives listening in on the call, and the lead detective arrests Slim's father for helping him. After getting their car back, Slim asks Junior to take a picture of him and Queen.Before making their way to their next destination, Queen decides to take a detour and stop at the cemetery to visit her mother's grave. He explains to Slim that she and her mother were close until Queen grew older. One day, she and Earl argued, and Earl pushed Queen's mother down the stairs and cracked her head. Since Queen had just passed the bar, she was eager to take on her first case, not realizing it would be Earl, but she let him go since she knew it was an accident. Slim holds Queen close as she gets emotional, leading to them kissing. They park in an isolated area to make love. Meanwhile, a riot ensues as police continue to hunt the couple. Junior is among the protesters and is approached by a black SWAT officer who calmly tells him to go. Junior pulls a gun on the officer and impulsively pulls the trigger, killing him. Junior is later shot and killed as well.Queen and Slim go to the home of a friendly white couple called the Shepherds (Flea and Chloe Sevigny), who help protect certain people. They shelter the couple and give them dinner. Queen says grace, despite earlier telling Slim she's an atheist, and expresses thanks for the time she has had with him, no matter how it ends. Things are ruined when another police SWAT team shows up outside, and the Shepherds have Queen and Slim hide in a crawlspace under the bed in their room. The two stay there until the morning when they think they are safe. They get out through the window, but Queen injures her shoulder on the way down. They go to take a spare car from the Shepherds' garage, just as a black officer comes by to inspect the scene after he hears Queen's crying when Slim pops her shoulder back into place. The officer opens the garage door but lets Queen and Slim go, evading the police blockade on the street.The couple drive down an open street where they take turns sticking themselves out the window for fun. They reach a man who leads them to a friend with a plane that can get them away. He drives them to the tarmac, but as the two walk toward the plane, a whole squad of cops corner them. Queen and Slim have no choice but to turn around. Queen asks Slim if she can be his legacy, and he responds that she already is. An overzealous and racist cop then shoots Queen in the chest for no reason, instantly killing her. Slim holds her and carries her toward the cops, leading them to gun him down as well.News of the tragic end to the manhunt hits everywhere. The couple's names are revealed to be Angela Johnson and Ernest Hines, and the cops spin the narrative to make it seem like they were armed and dangerous. Earl, the Shepherds, Ernest's father, and everyone else they encountered are devastated by the news. Hundreds of civilians attend their funerals and view them as martyrs and heroes. The community even puts up a memorial image of the two of them based on the picture that Junior took."

Between 2014 and 2017, ISIS occupied the Iraqi city of Mosul. During those years, the only group to fight the occupiers continuously was Nineveh province's SWAT unit, made up of local men who had either been injured or had a family member killed by ISIS. Carnahan's Mosul is a gripping tribute to these fighters for whom the incentives were intensely personal. Kawa (Adam Bessa), a 21-year-old police officer, barely survives a firefight. When the smoke clears he meets the men who saved his life, the Nineveh SWAT, led by Jasem (Suhail Dabbach). Kawa's own uncle was recently killed by ISIS.

Before his first day with Nineveh SWAT is over, Kawa will witness the rescue of a child and the death of several colleagues, take revenge on a man who betrayed him, and participate in the ambush of an ISIS stronghold.

In 1862, pioneering meteorologist James Glaisher (Eddie Redmayne) teams up with daredevil balloon pilot Amelia Rennes (Felicity Jones) to advance human knowledge of the weather and fly higher than anyone in history. While their voyage to the very edge of existence helps the unlikely pair find their place in the world, they face physical and emotional challenges in the thin air, as the ascent becomes a fight for survival. In 1862 London, Amelia (Felicity Jones) and her sister, Antonia (Phoebe Fox), are traveling in a carriage to an unknown destination when Amelia has a panic attack and leaves the carriage. Antonia tries to talk her out of the upcoming balloon launch but Amelia refuses. Meanwhile, aspiring meteorologist James Glaisher (Eddie Redmayne) waits impatiently with his friend John (Himesh Patel, along with thousands of spectators, as it nears the time for his balloon launch. Eventually, Amelia, the balloon's pilot, arrives in a grand spectacle, putting on a show for the crowd much to the reserved Glaisher's chagrin. Despite being haunted by a vision of her late husband Pierre (Vincent Perez), Amelia keeps up the brave front and the balloon launches.In a flashback, James appears before the Royal Society and explains his theory that the weather can be predicted. He is laughed out of the building, the jeers led by Charles Green. Returning home, he talks to his parents, who try to persuade him to pursue another avenue of science. On the balloon, James and Amelia start rising through the cloud layer (in 9 min and 23 secs, they are at 5450 feet). Both delight in the experience but soon run into a violent storm which sends the balloon spinning. In a flashback, Antonia persuades Amelia to attend a society function. There, Amelia is approached by James and dances with him to put off an approaching suitor. As they dance, James asks if she would be willing to be his pilot while he attempts to prove his theories. Amelia is angered when she realizes that James attended the dance to simply meet her but agrees to be his pilot. Days later, as she is assembling the balloon, Amelia is confronted by Antonia, who asks that Amelia give up on being an Aeronaut and try a more conventional career path.After a close brush with death, with James suffering a head injury, they make it through the storm and continue rising. James releases the first of five pigeons carrying messages stating the current altitude along with other scientific readings in case they don't survive. As time passes, James and Amelia get to know each other and start to enjoy each other's company, with James becoming less concerned with his readings and starting to enjoy the experience. They discover an air current which is home to a flock of butterflies, confirming one of John's theories which James had always refuted. In a flashback, as James practices for the flight, Amelia approaches and tells him she's changed her mind. He is horrified, as money has already been spent, but she is unmoved and leaves. James goes to tell his father, suffering from dementia, but when his father speaks of his pride in James, it causes him to back out. Desperate, James approaches Green asking to accompany him on a flight. Green refuses, scoffing at the idea. John goes to see Amelia, showing her a book containing James' studies on snowflakes to show how much the flight would mean to James. Amelia goes to Pierre's grave to reflect. When it begins to snow, as James predicted, she decides to go with him after all.Eventually, the balloon exceeds 23,000 feet, beating the record for the highest altitude and James releases another pigeon. Amelia finds out James didn't bring any clothes suitable for the rapidly decreasing temperature and decides to start descending. James refuses, and the two argue. Amelia agrees to keep rising, but makes it clear to James that they'll have to start descending soon. At 26500 feet, The temperature is now well below freezing and as James finds the last pigeon frozen, he throws it, some equipment, and sandbags overboard to speed up their ascent. James is experiencing Hypoxia from the altitude and insists they continue to climb. The two get into a scuffle, and James earns himself a slap from Amelia when he invokes Pierre's name (James suggests that Pierre risked Amelia's life in pursuit of fame, bu Amelia corrects him that she was the ambitious one and Pierre tried to stop her and when the mistake could not be rectified, he sacrificed himself so that she could live). She tells him the story of how Pierre sacrificed himself to save her during a balloon flight. This brings James to his senses, and he agrees to descend. Amelia discovers the gas release valve on top of the balloon is frozen. As James falls unconscious, she has no choice but to climb up the outside of the balloon and open the valve from the top. With frostbite setting in on her hands, she struggles upward and manages to open the air release slightly, wedging her boot in the valve, causing a slow release of the gas. Amelia loses consciousness and topples over the side but is saved by her rope tether. At its peak their balloon reached 36,010 feet.When she awakens, Amelia manages to swing back to the balloon and wake James. As they continue to descend, snow begins to hovers around them, and they realize the balloon is collapsing from the loss of too much gas. They manage to close the gas release but it is not enough to slow their descent, so they throw everything they can over the side. When this doesn't work, they climb into the framework and release the basket. Amelia then prepares to sacrifice herself to save James, but James convinces her that they can use the balloon as a parachute, which slows their descent. They crash through trees and hit the ground hard, with Amelia being dragged along behind the balloon. She wakes and calls for James, who staggers towards her. Both are injured, but euphoric that they managed to survive. A voice-over by Amelia states that James' findings eventually paved the way for the first weather reports. James gives another speech to the Royal Society, and he and his field are finally accepted, earning a standing ovation from his fellows. James and Amelia go on another balloon flight together."

Honey Boy,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8151874/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young actor's stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father and deal with his mental health. From a screenplay by Shia LaBeouf, based on his own experiences, award-winning filmmaker Alma Har'el brings to life a young actor's stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father through cinema and dreams. Fictionalizing his childhood's ascent to stardom, and subsequent adult crash-landing into rehab and recovery, Har'el casts Noah Jupe and Lucas Hedges as Otis Lort, navigating different stages in a frenetic career. LaBeouf takes on the daring and therapeutic challenge of playing a version of his own father, an ex-rodeo clown and a felon. Artist and musician FKA Twigs makes her feature-film debut, playing neighbor and kindred spirit to the younger Otis in their garden-court motel home. Har'el's feature narrative debut is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between filmmaker and subject, exploring art as medicine and imagination as hope. Sent to court-ordered rehab after yet another encounter with the police while driving under the influence, Otis, a now-grown-up former child actor and rising movie star, is diagnosed with PTSD. Enraged, resistant Otis is encouraged by his counsellor to flash back to his troubled youth, when a then-twelve-year-old Otis was in the grip of James: a former rodeo clown and his abusive, alcohol-dependent father.—Nick Riganas In 2005, Otis Lort is a movie star who has an extreme alcohol problem. He crashes his car and gets into a violent, drunken altercation with police. He is forced to go to a rehab facility, where his counselor, Dr. Moreno, tells him that if he leaves the facility before they say he is ready, the court will send him to prison for his violent offenses. Dr. Moreno tells Otis that he has PTSD, which he denies repeatedly, but she encourages him to look into his past through exposure therapy.Going back a decade earlier to 1995, Otis remembers working as a child actor, who is accompanied on set by his father, James (Shia LaBeouf), a former rodeo clown. James is four years sober but clearly on edge and unpredictable, manic and aggressive. The two live in a meager motel complex where a shy young woman (FKA Twigs) lives across from them. Otis is in the Big Brother program at the behest of his mother, despite James's dislike and jealousy. Otis wants to go to a baseball game with Tom from the program, and James agrees if Tom comes over for a barbecue.To 2005 again, Otis is shown communicating with his rehab roommate Percy and continues therapy. He resists the process, finding it unhelpful. Back to his memories, Otis remembers Tom coming over for the barbecue, and James throwing him into the pool and violently threatening him. When he is offered a part in a movie that will be shot in Canada, Otis calls his mother, who isn't sure if James can accompany him because he's a registered sex offender. This causes James to begin screaming at her via Otis, who has to relay both of his parents conversations back to each other.Back to present, after resisting yet again, Otis's counselor Alec advises him to go into the woods and scream as loud as he can. Then the film shows James attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, where he tells of his abusive stepmother, how he got into drugs and alcohol abuse, and while blacked out attempted to rape a woman which got him registered as a sex offender. Alone at his place, Otis spends time with the Shy Girl, and the two cuddle and he gives her money.James forces Otis to rehearse his scenes over and over again, and he stops to scream at the neighbors across the way for being too loud. Otis asks him to stop, and tells him that no one else would hire him because he's a sex offender, and that Otis is his boss since James is making money off him. In 2005, Otis thanks Alec for the advice, and continues to work with Dr. Moreno on controlling his anger.In 1995, Otis finally confronts his father and tells him he needs to start being a better dad to him. James hits him in the face twice, furious at Otis for speaking to him that way, and then leaves on his motorcycle and scores drugs at a strip club. Alone, Otis spends time with the Shy Girl, and the two are caught waking up together the next morning by James. The Shy Girl slaps James and leaves, and James vomits and asks Otis how he thinks it feels to hear his own son talk to him like that, and to have to resort to accepting payment from him. Otis tells James if he didn't pay him James wouldn't be there.James takes Otis to marijuana plants he has been growing off the highway and smokes cannabis with him. In 2005, Otis revisits the motel, and imagines himself finding his father there in his rodeo clown costume. He tells his father he's going to make a movie about him. James asks him to make him look good. The two ride away on James's motorcycle, which fades into Otis alone driving away."

Marie met Pierre Curie (Sam Riley) in 1894 at a random street when she ran into him and Pierre saw her book and saw she is interested in radioactivity.Marie is a professor at a French university and shares lab space with Gabriel Lippmann (Simon Russell Beale). But she is not respected as she is a female and Polish, and her experiments and lab equipment are constantly moved without her agreement. Marie's sister advises her to apologize, but Marie is stubborn and wont.Marie runs into Pierre again at the theatre and is shocked to know that Pierre knows her name (she is one of the only 23 female scientists in Paris, has read her paper on magnetic properties of steel, and has heard of her fight with Lippmann). Pierre is a renowned scientist and offers his lab for experiments to Marie. She is insistent that she wont be Pierre's mistress and wont accept interference in her experiments.
Soon, she figures that the Uranium Ore is more potent than the element itself and theorizes the existence of a new element. Marie is afraid of hospitals as her mother died in one and doesn't accompany Pierre to the Paris hospital for an equipment that will help them identify elements in microscopic quantities.Marie theorizes that Uranium atoms are giving off some sort of energy and transforming into a new element. Up till that point, the uranium effect was considered a chemical reaction with the air. Soon, Pierre married Marie. Paul Langevin (Aneurin Barnard) is their lab associate. She continues her experiments with more bigger quantities of Uranium Ore. soon, she is preggers. She gives birth to Irene Curie (Anya Taylor-Joy).
Soon, Marie and Pierre are able to isolate a pin-prick of Radium & Polonium from 4 tonnes of uranium ore. Marie also coins the term ""Radioactivity"" for the rays coming from these ""unstable"" atoms.The results are accepted by the scientific community and Pierre makes professor at a prestigious university. Marie is preggers again. She sleeps with a vial of radium in her bed and soon Pierre falls sick. Pierre convinces Marie not to patent Radium so people can discover the possibilities of their new science. Marie sees radium being used for X rays and even as a possible cure for cancer.
Pierre develops a bad rash on his wrist from exposure to radium and Marie is preggers again. Ève Curie (Cara Bossom) is born.
In 1903 Marie and Pierre win the Nobel prize for discovery of radioactivity. Pierre talks about the dangers of radioactivity (which ultimately lead to the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima in 1945). Marie is super angry at Pierre for going to the ceremony alone (Marie had just given birth) and she thinks Pierre stole her brilliance and made it his own.Pierre's coughing grows and he begs Marie to leave Paris, but she wont budge. Pierre has a coughing fit on the street and runs into a horse carriage and is crushed underneath. Marie is inconsolable. Marie is offered Pierre's job at the university, but she declines at first. Paul advises her to accept Pierre's death and move on. She starts teaching at the university.
Rumors start appearing that radium is making people sick. Marie is defenseless and starts an affair with a considerate Paul. A few months later Paul confirms studies that have linked Radioactivity as the source of cancer. Soon, Paul's wife releases details of their scandal to the press and Marie is disgraced and asked to leave France. Paul leaves Marie under threat from his own wife.The movie talks about other effects of radiation, such as ever powerful nuclear weapons, cure for cancer and then the explosion at Chernobyl. Marie wins the Nobel prize again in 1911 for chemistry. She goes to Sweden for her acceptance speech and is applauded for her work. Irene grows up and is a nurse in WW1. she asks her mother to make the war her own war and do something about it.
Marie approaches Lippmann for funds to device a mobile x ray unit that could determine if troops need amputation at the fronts, before their limbs are chopped off. Marie advises Irene to stay away from radiation as its effects are not fully understood yet. Lippmann again denies Marie, but this she threatens to go to the press and sell her pure gold Nobel medals to raise funds for her machines. She gets her funding.
The machines work and start savings lives and limbs on the battlefield. She died on July 4, 1934 and was buried next to Pierre. Irene went on to win the Nobel prize with her husband for discovery of artificial radioactivity. In France, to this day, radioactive treatment is called Curietherapie."

In 1970s Los Angeles, Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy) is a struggling artist working in a record store, trying to get his music on the air in the in-store radio station. At night, he moonlights as a MC for Ben Taylor (Craig Robinson) and his musical group at a club. He asks the owner of the club for some time doing comedy, but the owner turns him down. At the record store one day, a homeless man comes wandering in and begins making loud, rhyming proclamations; one of which includes the name ""Dolemite"". Moore gets the idea to create a stage persona telling these stories at the club he works at. Dressing in pimp attire and brandishing a cane, Moore takes the stage at the club as Dolemite and launches into a crudely humorous and foul-mouthed routine entitled ""The Signifying Monkey"". Taylor and his group join him on-stage to back him up. The crowd applauds.Moore asks his aunt (Luenell) for money to record a comedy album entitled ""Eat Out More Often"". He gets his friend Jimmy Lynch (Mike Epps) to record him at his home in front of an audience. After making several copies of the record, Moore begins to sell them out of the trunk of his car. The record proves to be very popular, obtaining the attention of a record company who agree to market it to record stores. Moore offers to go on tour through the Deep South to promote the record. While in Mississippi, he meets a single mother named Lady Reed (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and convinces her to join him as part of his tour.Moore and his friends celebrate the success of the tour by taking in a movie, The Front Page. The majority white audience of the theater finds the film hilarious but Moore and his friends do not enjoy the film. Moore gets the inspiration to make a film starring himself as Dolemite. After being turned down by a film executive (Tip ""T.I."" Harris), Moore asks his record company for an advance on royalties from his album to fund the movie himself. The record executives agree to do so, but warn Moore if he fails that he will be in debt to them for the rest of his life.Moore gets in contact with playwright Jerry Jones (Keegan-Michael Key) and, despite initial reluctance, agrees to write the screenplay. Moore and Taylor go to a strip club and find Rosemary's Baby actor D'Urville Martin (Wesley Snipes) and offer him a role in their Dolemite film. Martin is offended by their offer until Moore gives him the opportunity to direct the film himself. Moore and his friends convert an old, abandoned hotel into a makeshift soundstage. Martin invites a group of white film students from UCLA to work as the film's crew, including Nicholas Josef von Sternberg (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as cinematographer.Moore, Martin, Jones and crew begin filming Dolemite, a kung-fu-themed Blaxploitation film. Moore's lack of knowledge of karate and predilection towards camp frustrates Martin. Despite much of the cast and crew having a lot of fun making the film, Martin leaves the crew after filming is completed, proclaiming the film will never be seen by anyone. No film distributor Moore contacts will agree to purchase the film. He decides to return to touring, though with much less enthusiasm. In Indiana, Moore is asked about the film's release by a local DJ (Chris Rock) and remains noncommittal about whether the film will ever be seen. The DJ says that he could premiere the film in town with the right amount of promotion. Deciding to take him up on the offer, Moore promotes the film single-handedly all around town. Though he spends a lot of money on four wall distribution, Moore is pleased to see a massive crowd waiting outside the theater and the audience greatly enjoys the film.A Hollywood film executive (Bob Odenkirk), whose studio Dimension Pictures had turned down Dolemite previously, finds out about the premiere in Indiana and contacts Moore with the promise of purchasing the film. Moore arrives at Dimension Pictures dressed as Dolemite along with Lady Reed and the crew dressed up as well. The executive says that although Moore could continue promoting the film himself, he would not see profits right away. However, Dimension Pictures could put the film in theaters and everyone would profit. Moore agrees and begins working on promoting the film professionally. En route to the Hollywood premiere of the film, Moore and the cast read critical reviews of the film that lower their spirits. Upon arrival, however, the group is astonished to see an even bigger crowd of people cheering for them outside the theater. While the cast and crew go inside the theater to see the film, Moore stays outside to entertain the crowd who have to wait for the next show.The film's epilogue notes that Rudy Ray Moore continued to tour and star in sequels to Dolemite until his death in 2008. He is today considered to be the ""Godfather of Rap"". Footage from the real Dolemite is screened as well."

Her sorority sisters Kris, Marty, Jesse, and Helena are taking part in the DKO talent show with a dance choreographed by Riley. Riley gives Helena her lucky comb. Meanwhile, Kris has drawn the ire of the DKO fraternity and Professor Gelson due to her creating a petition requesting that university founder and notorious misogynist Caleb Hawthrone's bust is moved away from the main building and another requesting that Gelson is fired due to his refusal to teach books written by women. While at her job at a coffee shop, Riley learns that Brian will be back in town to oversee the talent show.

Geppetto, a poor Italian carpenter - upon seeing the puppet theater run by Mangiafuoco - decides to build a wooden puppet to tour the country and earn him a living. He visits his friend and colleague Mastro Ciliegia to ask him for a piece of wood to work on. Frightened by a living log, Ciliegia gifts it to Geppetto who begins to build the puppet, which he decides to name 'Pinocchio'. During the process, Geppetto realizes that Pinocchio is alive and sentient, and decides to take him as his son. Now that he has a body, Pinocchio starts running outside and returns home while Geppetto is still looking for him in town. Geppetto's roommate, a hundred-year old Talking Cricket, tries to help Pinocchio by giving him advice, but the puppet, considering him annoying, throws a hammer to shut him up.Later, Geppetto returns to his place and finds Pinocchio with his feet burned, since he had fallen asleep near the ashes of the chimney. After having to rebuild them, he forgives Pinocchio for his actions. In order to educate him, Geppetto sells his jacket to buy Pinocchio an ABC book. Struck by this sacrifice, Pinocchio sets off on his first day at school. However, his good intentions are diverted by the puppet theater, for which he sells the book to buy a ticket. In the theater, the other puppets notice Pinocchio in the audience and call him to come up on stage, impatient to meet their new brother. Furious that his production went upstream, the puppeteer Mangiafuoco locks Pinocchio in his caravan and leaves the town. At night, Mangiafuoco plans to use Pinocchio as firewood in order to cook his dinner. Pinocchio begs the puppeteer to release him in order to return home from his father, certainly worried about his non-return. Sneezing with emotion, Mangiafuoco decides to let him go, choosing to burn another puppet in his place: however, Pinocchio does not accept that someone should pay for a disaster he did, and accepts his punishment. Surprised by Pinocchio's action, Mangiafuoco lets him go, and out of pity, gives him five gold coins to give to Geppetto.The next day, Pinocchio returns home. Along the way, he meets a fox and a cat, both pretending to be disabled. Attracted by the coins, they suggest that he should try to sow them in the Field of Miracles, a place where they will sprout in a tree full of money. Enticed by the idea of becoming rich, Pinocchio allows himself to be accompanied by the two to the Field of Miracles, which is located in the Land of Barn Owl. The three stop to eat at a tavern, at Pinocchio's expense. After agreeing to resume the journey at midnight, the Cat and the Fox separate from the puppet, saying they have to go to find a sick relative. Pinocchio resumes the journey alone. Ignoring the warnings of the Talking Cricket, Pinocchio ventures into the woods and has an unpleasant encounter with two hooded assassins (the Cat and the Fox in disguise). Pinocchio hides the remaining four coins in his mouth and attempts to run away, but is caught and hung from a tree.Pinocchio is rescued by a young blue-haired fairy, who lives nearby. The next day, the Fairy calls in some doctors, an Owl, a Crow and the Talking Cricket, who each give their diagnostic. Pinocchio refuses to drink a medicine until he is scared into taking it at the prospect of dying and being put in a coffin, carried by a group of undertaker rabbits. Once healed, Pinocchio is asked why he was in the forest and not at home or in school. Embarrassed, he lies but his nose becomes bigger and bigger with each lie he tells, until the Fairy is forced to summon a flock of woodpeckers in order to shorten his nose. The Fairy befriends Pinocchio and sends him off to be reunited with Geppetto.However, on his way home, Pinocchio again meets the Fox and the Cat who, seeing that their plan has failed, stick to the original plan and convince him to go to the Field of Miracles. Upon arriving to the Field, Pinocchio plants the coins and goes to get some water. In the meantime, the Fox and the Cat steal the coins and run away. Discovering the theft, Pinocchio runs to the local court to report the fact to the gorilla judge. Since justice does not favor the innocent in Barn Owl, he is sentenced to life sentence. Pinocchio manages to get exonerated by saying that he previously committed a crime, making him guilty, and thus he is then released.Pinocchio returns home but, through his neighbors, discovers that Geppetto has left to go look for him everywhere and decided to continue his search overseas in North America, still thinking that he is in the hands of Mangiafuoco.

Jexi,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9354944/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Phil makes top 10 pop lists at work. His only ""friend"" is cellphone Siri. His new phone includes AI helper Jexi, who improves/controls his social life. Phil has a major dependency issue - he's addicted to his phone. He has no friends, he has a job writing pop culture ""Top 10"" lists, and his love life is non-existent. But his Facebook status is about to change. When he is forced to upgrade his phone, the latest model comes with an unexpected feature...Jexi - an A.I. life coach, virtual assistant and cheerleader. With her help, Phil begins to get a real life. But as he becomes less dependent on his phone, Jexi's artificial intelligence morphs into a tech nightmare determined to keep Phil all to herself, even if it means ruining his chances of finding success. The movie opens with a flashback of a young Phil out to dinner with his parents. His parents begin arguing and causing a scene, so his mother passes him a cell phone (older bulkier model) to play with.During a montage, we see Phil enamored with phones as he grows up, and his parents are still arguing. Phil (Adam DeVine) is now an adult and works for a list-making website in the vein of Buzzfeed, which is run by Kai (Michael Peña). Kai pressures the staff to come up with more lists involving trending topics that generate lots of hits such as pizza and cute animals. Phil is a writer in the list department, but he really would rather work in the real news department since that's what he has a degree in. Kai doesn't want to promote Phil to that department, though, and we see that Kai is kind of like Phil but dumber. After work, Phil's coworkers, Craig and Elaine (Ron Funches and Charlyne Yi) invite him to come to play kickball with them after work, but being socially inept, Phil feigns that he has a busy schedule and declines the invitation.When he checks his iPhone, we see that he has nothing scheduled. On the way home from work, Phil is wrapped up in his phone and ends up walking into local bike shop owner Cate (Alexandra Shipp). Phil and Cate talk for a second, and Cate is slightly flirtatious, but Phil is more concerned with his slightly damaged phone but concludes it will be OK overall. Then another biker bumps into Phil and causes his phone to get absolutely destroyed.When Phil takes his now broken phone to the store, he encounters the tech (Wanda Sykes) who berates Phil for being overly reliant on his cellphone and requiring one to get through basic life situations. Phil insists that he get his phone replaced, though, so she leaves to retrieve his replacement device. Back at his apartment, Phil powers on the new phone and sets it up, which is where Jexi, the virtual assistant (voiced by Rose Byrne) gets the passwords to his accounts after he neglects to read the user agreements. Jexi then starts to bond with and also berate Phil throughout the following days as she starts trying to get him to break out of his usual behavior since her purpose of existing is, ""making his life better."" She pretends to be Phil and emails an insulting letter to Kai, calling him a virgin and demanding the promotion.When Phil gets to work, Kai demotes him to the ""Comment section,"" which happens to be where the older employees at the company work in a dark basement. Craig and Elaine come down to the basement and invite Phil to play kickball again, and he declines, but Jexi puts him on blast as having nothing to do except ""masturbate furiously and cry himself to sleep."" Phil embarrassingly agrees to come along and is disastrously wrong, which costs the team the game. Phil invites everyone out for drinks, but they turn him down. Back at home, Phil thinks about Cate and looks up the bike shop where she told him she works. Jexi thinks Phil is stalking Cate and that it's weird, so she dials the bike shop against Phil's protests and moves the end call button around the screen so that he can't hang up. After an awkward moment of silence, Phil talks to her and stumbles through the conversation, which elicits sympathy from Jexi.The next morning, Phil sees Cate when they stop at the same coffee shop, and she ends up giving her phone number to him, which turns everything around, and they end up setting up a date. When Phil goes to play kickball that day with his coworkers, he is a stud and is making ridiculous plays, and they win. He also bonds with his coworkers over being fans of Days of Thunder fans. That night Phil talks to Jexi and thanks to her for helping him make changes in his life. When Phil goes on his date, it goes south as Phil starts asking weird questions that draw hilarious responses from Jexi. Cate says that Phil is paying more attention to his phone than to Cate, and Phil decides to be honest about liking Cate a lot.Cate decides since she got dressed up, she might as well stay on the date, and they go biking instead until Phil crashes off his bike and ruins it. After he and Cate part ways, he decides he argues with Jexi and then decides to throw her away but changes his mind when he can't remember how to get home. Later Cate comes up with the idea that she and Phil should go to the Kid Cudi concert, and she sends him a cleavage pic to entice him into it. Phil thinks the proper response is sending a dick pic despite Jexi's advising him not to, and she refuses to allow him to send any of the multiple ones he took. We then see the phone screen, and Cate has sent a message to Phil thanking him for not sending a dick pic since she thinks that it's gross.When Phil gets to work the next day, one of the real news employees suffered a freak accident thanks to some app on his phone, and Kai promotes Phil, and he moves into the office space. When it's time to go to the concert, Cate insists Phil leave his phone at home, which makes Jexi jealous. Cate and Phil sneak into the concert and sneak backstage where they meet Kid Cudi and party with him.That night, they end up having sex. When Phil gets home, Jexi is mad and decides to ruin Phil's life.At work that day, Phil gets fired after Jexi sends a mass dick pic text to the entire company, so he decides to get a replacement phone again. He gets home to set up the new phone, and Jexi has followed him to the new device because she's in the cloud. When Phil goes to see Cate at the bike shop, her ex-fiancee she told him about earlier in the film has come back into town coincidentally, and he looks better than he did before. Things look like Cate might get back together with him, so Phil breaks off his relationship with Cate for fear of being hurt.Phil and Jexi bond again, and Phil becomes a slob who is heavily reliant on his phone again. Jexi then lets it slip that Cate's ex is at a hotel, and Phil deduces that Jexi set the two of them up to separate Phil and Cate, so he storms out of the apartment, leaving the phone inside. Jexi follows him in the streets from car to radio to electronic sign and eventually crashes a car into the phone store Phil got her from.When Phil arrives at the hotel, he apologizes to Cate and ends up punching her ex, who tries to interrupt him to tell Phil that he's leaving, and Cate isn't accompanying him to Brazil as he thought. Cate and Phil end up back together, and Jexi and Phil make up as well, and she tells him she's proud of him and happy for him and calls Phil her friend.The movie ends with Kai meeting Jexi through his phone and making him do his dance while we see Jexi putting Kai through similar things that she put Phil through."

A Call to Spy,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7698468/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"In the beginning of WWII, with Britain becoming desperate, Churchill orders his new spy agency - SOE - to recruit and train women as spies. In the beginning of WWII, with Britain becoming desperate, Churchill orders his new spy agency -- the Special Operations Executive (SOE) -- to recruit and train women as spies. Their daunting mission: conduct sabotage and build a resistance. SOE's ""spymistress,"" Vera Atkins (Stana Katic), recruits two unusual candidates: Virginia Hall (Sarah Megan Thomas), an ambitious American with a wooden leg, and Noor Inayat Khan (Radhika Atpe), a Muslim pacifist. Together, these women help to undermine the Nazi regime in France, leaving an unmistakable legacy in their wake. Inspired by true stories.—Sarah Megan Thomas, author During World War II, France has fallen to the Nazis and Great Britain stands alone. Churchill hastily creates a spy agency to create resistance behind enemy lines and conduct sabotage. The first spies are dropped behind enemy lines.
In August, 1941, a woman is dragged into a cell by Nazi soldiers. She repeatedly has her head forcibly dunked into a bucket of water as the Nazis try to discern her identity. She continues to claim her name is Bridgett.
Three months earlier, at the special executive offices of Special Operations in London, Christopher (Samuel Roukin) reports to his superior Maurice Buckmaster (Linus Roache) that another spy had been discovered and killed because he was carrying British cigarettes. Vera Atkins (Stana Katic) hustles into the office. Churchill has approved using women as spies and Atkins is dispatched to recruit pretty ladies to operate inside France.
Meanwhile, American Virginia Hall (Sarah Megan Thomas) is rejected by her government to serve on the diplomatic corps because of her wooden leg. She lost her leg in a hunting accident. For years, she had hoped to become a diplomat. The United States did not believe diplomats could have wooden legs Virginia has been in Europe for years and now works as a clerk in London, still angling for something bigger.
Virginia meets Vera Atkins by chance at a party in early 1941. Vera is recruiting women for an exclusive little ""club,"" as she calls it, within Britain's fledgling secret service agency. Noor Inayat Khan (Radhika Apte), a wireless radio operator who is a Muslim Indian British citizen is also recruited. Born in Russia to an American mother and an Indian father, Noor looks small and fragile. Thanks to her Sufi beliefs, she is a pacifist. But she can send coded messages quickly and reliably, and Vera believes she will be a crack agent if given the chance.
At a Scottish estate, the new recruits, male and female, are trained in espionage sabotage and survival skills. Noor and Virginia are roommates but only know each by their codenames: Madeline and Bridgett respectively. Virginia introduces Noor to her wooden leg she has named Cuthbert.
Hall excels in her training and is advanced to more rigorous training. The head dunking incident in the baren room was a test of her ability to withstand torture. Afterwards, she agrees to be the first female agent. Posing as an American reporter, she will be dropped in unoccupied territory. Her mission is to create a central hub supplying agents with money, safe houses and whatever else they may need and supply the Baker Street headquarters with information about life in France to help their agency.
In September 1941, Virginia arrives on Lyon France. Her first contact is Dr. Raul Chevain (Rossif Sutherland). Agent Alphonse (Andrew Richardson) is already on the ground as the wireless transmitter operator. Hall carries cyanide in case she is captured by the Nazis. In their first meeting, Dr. Chevain, he tells Virginia of an agent named James (Ben Chase) hidden away in a country home who shattered his leg when he parachuted for his assignment. Virginia is driven out to meet him and resolves to get him back to Britain.
Hall first makes contact with Alfonse in a restaurant. She makes the mistake of ordering a gin on a Sunday and is questioned by authorities and asked to show her papers. Virginia then begins to recruit French citizens as members of the resistance. She also records the new laws the Germans are forcing the French to adopt including food rations, farm products quotas that must be given to the Germans, women's prohibition from buying cigarettes and the registration of the resident Jews. She and Alfonse find a landing strip to land a plane to rescue the injured agent.
At headquarters, Atkins and Buckmaster debate inserting Noor in the field as a wireless operator. Noor is to be placed on the airplane that is to transport the injured agent. Noor bids farewell to her mother. Atkins watches the full moon rise in her home and her mother Hilda (Lola Pashalinski) believes Vera is longing for her boyfriend who is a soldier marked missing in action.
Soon after, Noor codename Madeline transmits a signal from Virginia codename Bridgett and is nearly caught escaping out of the basement of the safehouse in which she was hiding. Virginia gets access to a nunnery by offering Sister Francis (Marceline Hugot) additional food coupons to hide their agents. Virginia meets Dr. Chevain for a meal and asks to hide Noor in a basement. At lunch, she tells the doctor how she lost her leg in a hunting accident. Virginia is able to taste a bit of chocolate for desert and receives a bit of soap, both luxuries in France.
Virginia is astounded by the hatred of the Jews and how the Nazis control everything the French hear and read. As Virginia gets Noor situated at Chevain's home, Father Robert Alesche (Joe Doyle), famous for his anti-Nazi sermons, arrives seeking Bridgett's help. Bridgett overhears the priest and doctor's conversation and does not trust the authenticity of the priest.
Meanwhile, Vera struggles with the British authorities when they uncover her identity as a Romanian Jew. Buckmaster assures her that she is indispensable to him even though England has declared war on Romania, Finland and Hungary. Vera's citizenship papers are denied.
The United States enter the war on December 7th, 1941, after the Pearl Harbor attack. Virginia's cover is blown as Americans will no longer be allowed in France. Vera suggests a new identity and hairstyle for Virginia. She is given the new codename Philomen. Father Alesche is cleared for contact by London.
Noor is transferred to Paris. On the train ride to her new assignment, the train is stopped and searched but another woman is discovered and arrested by the Nazis.
Virginia continues to excel in supplying agents passing through Lyon. She discovers a Nazi supply line and works to blow up the train in transport. Noor tries to relocate to a new safehouse but a collaborator is arrested just as she arrives and she is advised to leave by the prostitutes there. Noor hides among the graves but goes missing when the Northern Circuit in Paris is infiltrated.
Virginia joins Alfonse, Agent Paul (Rob Heaps), and George (Jean Brassard), a local mechanic, in placing explosives on the track. The police capture George and their wireless communications case. The remaining conspirators devise a plan to get George a wrench in a care package so he could pick the prison lock and escape. Isabella (Juliana Sass) delivers the Monopoly game, but must play it with the guards before it is turned over to the prisoners who use the wrench to escape. As the group seeks to take the escapees to the abbey, there are stopped by a Vichy policeman who holds them at gunpoint. They fight back and assassinate the officer and reach their destination to hide George and Paul.
Noor finds an old friend named Giselle (Mathilde Ollivier) who agrees to hide her for a few days and she is able to contact London. She refuses to return home and willing to help rebuild the northern circuit.
In November, 1942, the Nazi presence grows in Lyon. Klaus Barbie (Marc Rissmann) arrives and has a specific interest in tracking down Philomen. He instructs Father Robert Alesche who is a double agent, to find her. Dr. Chevain obtains one if the Nazi wanted posters for Virginia and tells her she must take the train south to escape. A short time later Chevain is arrested and tortured. Alphonse is caught and shot in the street.
Virginia boards the train to Perpignon. Giselle's husband (Dániel Benedek) betrays Noor to the Nazis for money and Noor is arrested. The Nazis have her code book and begin transmitting as Madeline. When the transmission is received in Brittain, Leo Marks (Alistair Brammer), a wireless receiver, has suspicion that the transmission is not authentic because it is perfect. Buckmaster decides to go ahead with the parachute drop of agents at the coordinates the Nazis provided. Virginia is provided the location of a safehouse near the Spanish border before beginning a 35-mile trek across the mountains. In her perilous journey to Spain where she struggles with great pain in her leg.
The replacement agents fall into the hands of the Gestapo. Noor is transported away from her imprisonment to a concentration camp in Dachau. Virginia, with the help of her guide, crosses the Pyrenees mountains into Spain. Virginia makes it back to England to meet with Buckmaster and Atkins. She criticizes the F section for failing to protect their agents and having too many agents assigned to a single wireless operator. She wishes to return to France but is denied because her identity is compromised. Vera is accused of being responsible for clearing Father Robert Alesche who proved to be a double agent. Vera demands her citizenship papers and proper rank. She feels discriminated against as being born a Jew.
In January, 1944, Vera is finally recognized for her accomplishments with a uniform and her citizenship papers. She is called into a meeting with Buckmaster to teach their OSS counterparts by Wild Bill Donovan (Matt Salinger) their methods of spying and sabotage. Virginia now works as a wireless operator in Britain for the Americans. Atkins asks her to accompany her to deliver a letter the Noor;s mother that explains that Noor was a hero but was executed a concentration camp. Virginia is promoted in the OSS and sent back to France in advance of the Jedburgh teams to continue their mission. Vera, Virginia and Noor were all decorated with honors when the war concludes"

We all have apartment horror stories: annoying roommates, asshole landlords, dilapidated buildings, among many more nightmare scenarios.

Situated on a quiet street in Los Angeles, it's got plenty of space, friendly tenants, group BBQs and even a cute neighbor next door. But this being L.A., all is not what it seems: loud noises start keeping her awake at night; her cat is missing; everyone seems to be a little too helpful and friendly, except for the weirdo, Lester.

Soon, Sarah learns she didn't choose this apartment - It chose her.—purstris We see the main actress, Sarah (Nicole Brydon Bloom) exit her slightly rusted blue car and walk up to an apartment building with a vacancy sign. She goes in and initially helps an older lady (Esther, Earnestine Phillips) not fall in the courtyard and has a look of calmness on her face.
She turns the corner onto the 2nd floor apartment building to look at the unit available and to her dismay the apartment is full of other people who came before her. As she turns to leave, a man Jerry (Taylor Nichols) tells her ""it's not first come first serve"". As she walks around the room she notices that there are 2 imprints in the wall that have been caulked and painted over. She runs her fingers over those raised bumps in the wall as she hears ""it's a smoke free and pet free apartment building"". Sarah is seen with Gus filling out an application and says 'No I don't have a pet"" when asked about the pet clause.She drives away and pulls into a motel. There she is seen sitting in a dimly lit room on the bed with a laptop in front of her. An orange tabby springs up onto her lap as she continues to browse online. She gets a phone call and looks at the phone reluctantly before she picks it up. It's her father (Guz, Alan Blumenfeld). He asks her if she is really doing this. Coming out to LA on her own and tossing school and her costume design dreams away. Sarah defiantly says no and mentions that she is going to sign up for extension courses. She already has found a job. Her step-mother comes into the frame and the phone call ends.We cut to Sarah at a desk job. It's an attorney office and she is some data entry person with a co-worker named Lisa (Celeste Sully), a sympathetic colleague at Sarah's generically taxing and underpaid temp job. We see Lisa get into a fight with one of the legal professionals about labeling certain pages and Lisa stands up to the other woman. Sarah peers on the dispute and is called out by Lisa after the other woman leaves. Sarah becomes flustered during the confrontation and Lisa reveals she's just teasing her. Lisa promises to show Sarah around the office when she returns from her call-back.Sarah gets a call from the apartment complex saying that she got the position. Sarah is next seen with a large crate under a blue blanket moving up into the second floor. She crate meows as she encounters the handsome boy (Brian (Giles Matthey)) she met earlier. Brian introduces himself as her neighbor and offers to help her move her items in. Sarah says she's got it and the scene cuts to her inside of the apartment.As they settle in over the coming days, Sarah keeps hearing weird noises during the night and assumes it's the pipes. But then she starts getting notices from the apartment building that pets are strictly forbidden. She ignores the first note, but then another quickly flashes under her door with ""selfish bitch"" written on it. She quickly opens the door and finds no one in the immediate hallway. She sees creepy, one-eyed Lester in the hallway across from her. Brian invites Sarah to a dinner party and she reluctantly agrees. Later however, we see Sarah coming with take-out with her co-worker, Lisa. Lisa and Sarah talk on the couch and Lisa supportively states that Sarah should continue to pursue her costume designer dream. Later that night Sarah's smoke detector goes off and smoke is coming out of the oven rapidly. Her cat got stuffed in the oven. Brian later ties her up to a wooden Ikea chair and gets out his toolbox of torture devices. But Sarah breaks the chair apart and makes a dash toward s the door.While trying to escape, she meets one of the other residents, Esther (Earnestine Phillips), and begs Esther to help her. Brian reassures the Esther that everything is under control and Esther says, better be. Sarah now realizes that the all other residents are in on the capture. Brian and Esther subdue her and knock her out. When she wakes up, she's in a boarded-up room wearing scrubs. Brian and Jerry come in and tell her she has to learn to cooperate. They make her stand with her hands against the wall in what they call a ""stress position."" As long as the lights are on, she has to stay in that position, and if she falls, she's punished. They go through this routine for days. During the torture, Lester is brought in and shown what happens to people who resist (ear ripped up) and when they try to escape (his eye was taken out). Sarah complies for another few days until she can't do it anymore. She is given an ultimatum, either hands on the wall or a bullet through her head. So they nail her hands to the wall. She eventually rips them off and sits in the corner. When the light turns on another time, Sarah is sitting in the corner and slowly gets up to put her hands on the bloody wall. At that moment Brian and Jerry come in, saying that she's passed the first part of the test to become a member of the community.For the following months, Sarah is incorporated into the community. She reads the doctrine that the community is based on and sees how the community runs. There is footage of her pacing back and forth around the room completely engrossed in the book. She quickly finds out that once you come into Asilo del Mar, you never get to leave. When Jerry decides she's ready to be an official member of the community, Sarah is branded behind her ear and given to Lester (Clayton Hoff), a man in the community who recently lost his wife to cancer. Sarah will be her replacement.Of course, Sarah won't just settle in. Not only does her dad come to try to talk some sense into her, but eventually, one of Sarah's old friends and coworkers, Lisa (Celeste Sully), applies to live in the apartment. She's chosen and put through the same rigorous testing and torture, but she can't handle it. She is too stubborn and won't cooperate. Jerry tries to force Sarah to lobotomize her, but instead, Sarah stabs Jerry. He kills Lisa, so Sarah kills Jerry. She takes off to try to escape the community, only to be stopped at the door by everyone. She is halfway through the door. She has her shoulder and arm outside, but the group pulls her in. She fires her gun and make them back off. Eventually Lester gets a hold of the gun. Sarah pleads to him to remember what it was like when he wanted to escape. He could escape too. In a moment's eye, Lester shoots the man holding Sarah, allowing her to escape through the door. We see Lester turn the gun towards his chin as the door closes and blood splatters on the frosted window. Sarah has escaped.As she's running down the street covered in blood, she realizes the entire street has CBE company as the real estate owner. She realizes that the whole street is owned by the same CBE company, CBE being the creator of the original doctrine. Sarah slows down in-front of another complex right as she notices a dome shaped camera on the outside of the complex. An alarm goes off and it flashes bright red, alerting an escape. Sarah turns and runs down the street as the siren blares in the distance."

Abby is a little controlling and has a very tight itinerary, and so the women go to a dinner at a fancy local restaurant. Their waitress, Jade Maya Erskine), mentions that she's recently broken up with her girlfriend, which piques Val's interest. Before they leave the restaurant, the women spot Brené Brown and rush to ask her questions before politely getting asked to give her space.After dinner, Catherine takes out some molly pills, but the girls are concerned about their various medications and decide not to do it and instead have more wine and dance.

Monos,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6062774/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"On a remote mountaintop, eight kids with guns watch over a hostage and a conscripted milk cow. Teenage commandos perform military training exercises by day and indulge in youthful hedonism by night, an unconventional family bound together under a shadowy force know only as The Organization. After an ambush drives the squadron into the jungle, both the mission and the intricate bonds between the group begin to disintegrate. MONOS, Alejandro Landes' awe-inspiring third feature, is a breathtaking survivalist saga set on a remote mountain in Latin America. The film tracks a young group of soldiers and rebels -- bearing names like Rambo, Smurf, Bigfoot, Wolf and Boom-Boom -- who keep watch over an American hostage, Doctora (Julianne Nicholson). The teenage commandos perform military training exercises by day and indulge in youthful hedonism by night, an unconventional family bound together under a shadowy force know only as The Organization.

Order descends into chaos and within MONOS the strong begin to prey on the weak in this vivid, cautionary fever-dream.

Landes brings together a diverse young cast of both seasoned professionals (including Hannah Montana's Moisés Arias) and untrained neophytes and thrusts them into an unforgiving, irrational and often surreal environment where anything can happen - even peace. A group of adolescent soldiers reign over the lofty heights of an unnamed Latin American mountaintop wilderness. This heavily armed rebel force spend their days completing training exercises, engaging in cult-like rituals and keeping watch over an American hostage. Order descends into chaos when a precious cow left in their care by drill captain Mensajero is inadvertently killed during a wild wedding celebration. On a faraway mountaintop, eight teenaged guerillas with guns watch over a hostage and a conscripted milk cow. Playing games and initiating cult-like rituals, the children run amok in the jungle and disaster strikes when the hostage tries to escape."

Nero is also controlling the Furcas CGI. The penalty games are actually a matter of life or death, as the odds are high that the games will result in a gruesome death.

For the first elimination, Lonni and Nevin are forced to participate in the game while the others watch in a soundproofed room.

A battle that he doesn't even realize, a fight with himself, a fight for his soul, for his future.—Wiki The Painted Bird is a deeply dramatic story examining the immediate relationship between terror and cruelty on one side and innocence and love on the other. Although the novel itself has been perceived as highly controversial since its publication in 1965, it has won global recognition and several prestigious literary awards. It is the first and the most celebrated novel by the author of the novels Being There and Pinball - one of the most significant and striking writers of the last century, Jerzy Kosinski.—nabarveneptace.cz Nearing the end of World War II, somewhere in a small hamlet of battle-scarred Eastern Europe, a Jewish pre-teen boy embarks on a dangerous journey to reunite with his parents. Left all alone to fend for himself, the boy meanders through the hostile uncharted territories of the poverty-stricken, prejudice-filled, and superstition-addled countryside, where evil is everywhere, and the lambs coexist with the wolves. But, somehow, the war child must summon up the courage to survive enslavement, torture, abuse, and a seemingly endless set of increasingly horrible ordeals, as bothAdolf Hitler's Nazis andIosif Stalin's Red Army soldiers roam the region. The boy's world is a bleak, nightmarish place for children and adults alike.

The bird is immediately ripped apart because it is different from its fellows. That lesson reinforces all The Boy already knows and will soon know better: difference is fatal.But there are rare moments of compassion: a German soldier spares The Boy, a priest intervenes on his behalf, and finally The Boy becomes the protégé of a Russian sniper, who is kind to the child, but ruthless with the enemy.And there are signs of love. The Boy is seduced by an older girl, finally re-discovering the comfort of intimacy, only to realize that he has been used.When he is miraculously reunited with his weakened father at the end of the war, The Boy is cold and impenetrable, hardened by his ordeal. Yet we can still glimpse something of the old, sensitive Boy behind the eyes of the new. Perhaps there is hope.SHORT SYNOPSISBased on the acclaimed Jerzy Kozinski novel, THE PAINTED BIRD is a meticulous 35mm black and white evocation of wild, primitive Eastern Europe at the bloody close of World War II.The film follows the journey of The Boy, entrusted by his persecuted parents to an elderly foster mother.

The Mandela Effect follows a man who becomes obsessed with facts and events that have been collectively misremembered by thousands of people. Believing the phenomena to be the symptom of something much larger, his obsession eventually leads him to question reality itself. Computer game designer Brendan (Charlie Hofheimer) and his wife, Claire (Aleksa Palladino), are grieving for their daughter Sam (Madeleine McGraw), who drowned trying to retrieve her Curious George doll from the ocean. As they reluctantly rummage through Sam's belongings, Brendan finds a copy of The Berenstain Bears. To the bewilderment of Brendan and his brother-in-law Matt (Robin Lord Taylor), they remember the title with ""Berenstein,"" even though they find no evidence that it was ever changed. This leads them to learn about many other examples of the ""Mandela Effect,"" collectively shared ""false"" memories. Brendan and Claire discover further discrepancies, such as clearly remembering that Sam's doll had a tail when it actually does not.Eventually, Brendan concludes that the discrepancies are due to shifts between parallel universes and that Sam is still alive in one of them. Despite objections from Claire and Matt, he tracks down Dr. Roland Fuchs (Clarke Peters), a scientist who has been alienated for holding similar beliefs. Dr. Fuchs's research indicates that the universe is a computer simulation, with the Mandela Effect being the result of reality being rewritten to prevent its inhabitants from exposing it as a simulation. They begin developing a special computer program that, when run on the quantum computer of Dr. Fuchs' old campus, could interrupt the simulation.This revelation takes a toll on Brendan's daily life and marriage. He also begins to have visions of Sam, which at first no one else sees, until one day she is inexplicably alive and everyone can perceive her. Disconcerted, Brendan visits Dr. Fuchs, only to be informed that he died by suicide two months ago. Having talked to him mere hours before, Brendan acknowledges the alteration as the simulation's attempt to thwart their plan. He rushes to finish the program, breaks into the college campus and runs it on the quantum computer. Glitches manifest and destabilize reality, prompting Brendan to rush home. As the family hold each other tightly, the simulation crashes.The simulation restarts, recreating the history of the universe. The family is shown at the beach again, with this time Brendan asking Sam to leave her Curious George doll -now without a tail- before going to the water. This saves Sam's life and allows the simulation to continue beyond the event that originally led to its discovery and crash. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

Although adults such as Luke's mother Claire cannot see Daniel, he appears physically real to Luke. The boys become close playmates, and their connection helps Luke cope with his parents' divorce. Their friendship comes to an abrupt end when Daniel convinces Luke that blending an entire bottle of Claire's psychiatric medication into a smoothie will give her superpowers.

Years later, the college-aged Luke is paralyzed by anxiety over his future, his social life and his responsibility to his mother, who struggles with paranoid delusions and a hatred of her own reflection.

IO,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3256226/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"As a young scientist searches for a way to save a dying Earth, she finds a connection with a man who's racing to catch the last shuttle off the planet. Sam (Margaret Qualley), one of the last survivors on a post-cataclysmic Earth, is a young scientist dedicated to finding a way for humans to adapt and survive, rather than abandon their world. But with the final shuttle scheduled to leave the planet for a distant colony, her determination to stay is rocked by the arrival of another survivor, Micah (Anthony Mackie). She must decide whether to journey with him to join the rest of humanity and begin life anew, or stay to fight for Earth's survival. In the future, the atmosphere of Earth becomes toxic destroying the civilizations. There is an exodus of the survivors that leave the planet to a space station on the gravity of the moon of Jupiter Io. The scientist Henry Walden and his daughter Samantha ""Sam"" Walden stay behind researching a means to save Earth from dying. Sam is researching bees expecting them to survive in the atmosphere to pollinize the plants. She thinks in the possibility of leaving Earth on the last shuttle to Io to meet her boyfriend Elon that has left Earth to live in the station. Out of the blue, there is a storm that destroys her camping and research. Soon a balloon lands and the pilot Micah asks for Dr. Walden, but Sam explains that her father is not in the camp but researching the nearby field. Micah decides to wait for him and on the next day, Sam confesses that her father died. He convinces her to travel in his balloon to the shuttle but soon they learn the launching place changed and Micah does not have enough helium to reach the spot. Meanwhile Sam learns that Elon was assigned to a ten-year voyage to Alpha Centauri and they will never see each other again. What will Sam do?—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Act I: (Voiceover of a woman). The Earth's atmosphere has turned-not just heated by climate change, but turned to poison. The vast majority of earthlings remaining flee in 100's of ""Exodus"" rockets to a space colony near Io. Switch scenes: person rides up in an ATV with an oxygen mask. Closeup shows the face of a woman. She enters a subway area, takes unusual samples from standing water while talking into a recording device. Then she drives away; up, up, up above the clouds to what looks like an abandoned lab with large telescope.
Act II: Everyday life of Sam, whose name is revealed when she writes a tender e-mail to Elon, who is obviously her love. Elon is at the space station near Io. He asks about Sam's father, and encourages her to get both of them on an Exodus flight to leave earth.
Sam grows vegetables-note that plants may or may not be affected by atmosphere-and makes trips down to the Zone for samples. In her down time, she reads a mythology book she took from an abandoned library, checks her wind turbines and solar panels, and every day plays a cassette tape with her dad's voice intended as a radio broadcast.
She also has a recurrent dream she has where she is standing on beach, breathing normally.
One day she goes to the Zone and see a massive thunderstorm coming. She rushes to return to the lab, only to find the wind turbines and solar panels damaged, and her lab where she tests samples destroyed. The greenhouse is relatively intact.
Another email from Elon tells Sam that Command is putting all its resources into a mission to transport earthlings to another star that is 10 light years away. The last of the Exodus transports will be leaving in four days.
Soon after that, a balloon shows up at the station. Out of the balloon capsule steps a man. Sam is standing there, just watching. The man walks up to her and says very clearly that he is looking for her father. She says she is his lab assistant, that he is out on a mission and should return soon. They make introductions; his name is Micah.
Now the survival activity is Sam and Micah's. He continues to demand to see Sam's ""boss""; Sam keeps stalling.
Eventually, Sam confesses that her dad is dead.
Mid-Act climax. Sam receives an email from Elon. She starts by saying that her dad is dead. Elon responds with condolences and then life-changing news: he has been asked to join the star mission and he has decided to go. He says their love can remain across the universe even as he leaves to a destination that is ten years away. Again, he urges Sam to leave on Exodus.
Sam is visibly upset. She behaves strangely, even seducing Mikah.
Mikah tells Sam that he will be taking her with him. He charts out the balloon's trip to meet the Exodus mission. Later, it turns out the location has changed and they won't have enough Helium. Sam says she knows where some is in the Zone. They leave, balloon in tow, for the Zone to get fuel so that they can launch the newly-filled helium balloon from a city park.
They get the helium to fill the balloon but Sam feels compelled to visit the final art exhibit that was installed in a museum in the Zone before they leave that she had alluded to earlier in the film. Micah reminds her that she only has one hour before they need to depart.
Act III: Sam in the museum. When Sam does not return within the hour, Micah goes to the museum to track her down. The scene before shows her fascinated by the exhibits, yet her face is troubled. There Micah sees Sam looking at a painting of Leda and the Swan and she reads from the description beside of it but doesn't initially understand so she asks Micah to teach her the meaning. Micah outlines this classic Greek myth. Sam appears to understand how it applies to her and the future of the earth providing vision and hope to Sam. Sam tells Micah that she has been having the same dream over and over about lighting a flame that burns dark purple (indicates insufficient oxygen to sustain human life) but that she can breath this new air in her dream so rather than replacing her oxygen canister, she removes her mask and inhales. Micah catches her in his arms (his mask remaining in place). In the epilogue we learn that her prior conditioning was effective resulting in her ability to breathe this ""new"" atmosphere. She tells him she will not leave; that Earth can be saved.
Epilogue: Sam standing on a misty/foggy beach with a Micah's child. Sam's voice over of email to Micah, encouraging him to bring people back to Earth as they can survive as she and her son have done and invokes recognition of her father quoting TS Elliott as to how we all come back to where we once started and its all new to us once again"

Noelle,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5097410/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Santa's daughter must take over the family business when her father retires and her brother, who is supposed to inherit the Santa role, gets cold feet. Noelle has always had to support and encourage her brother Nick, who was ordained to take over as Santa. When Nick disappears right before Christmas, Noelle goes on a funny and heartfelt journey to find him and, ultimately, what Christmas is really about. Noelle Kringle lives a life of joy and Christmas cheer, living in the North Pole with Santa Claus as her father. Life seems easy. But when her father passes, Noelle's brother, Nick, must be the new Santa Claus. Nick feels pressured and what sounded like a weekend getaway turned into a week of his absence. Noelle travels to rescue not only her brother, but Christmas.—cocoasloth The film opens on Christmas Eve. Kris Kringle/Santa Claus (Bryan Brendle) enters a house to deliver presents. He is found by a little girl, Noelle (Oakley Bull). Kris jokingly asks the girl not to tell that she saw him, but we quickly learn that he is playing along, as Noelle is Kris's daughter. Her brother Nick (Owen Vaccaro) and their mother (Julie Hagerty) get together for their presents. Kris gives Nick a Santa hat, taking the time to reveal that he is picking Nick as his successor. The family is excited, but when Noelle asks what her job will be when she grows up, Kris states that she will essentially spread Christmas cheer to help Nick do his job properly. Noelle accepts but is visibly disappointed.In the present, Noelle (now played by Anna Kendrick) works alongside Nick (now played by Bill Hader), who has taken up the mantle as Santa since their father passed away five months ago. Nick isn't particularly good at his job, constantly doing things like crashing the sleigh. They also work alongside their nerdy tech-based cousin Gabe (Billy Eichner). Noelle takes Nick through the ropes of being Santa, such as getting into chimneys, guiding the reindeer, and determining which kids are naughty or nice and what gifts they get. Nick gets so tired and stressed out, stating he could use a vacation. Noelle then suggests that he take the weekend off and pick any spot in the world to hang out and unwind. Nick likes the idea and takes her up on it.The North Pole finds that Nick is missing, and they freak out at the prospect of Christmas going on without their Santa. When it's discovered that Noelle gave Nick the idea, everyone turns on her and shuns her, leaving her upset. The Christmas judges then pick Gabe as the new Santa per their guidelines. While talking to head elf and former nanny Polly (Shirley MacLaine), Noelle figures that Nick has gone to Phoenix, Arizona. They go to the sleigh and argue over going off to find Nick, but they accidentally get the reindeer to fly off and take them on a sleigh ride outside the North Pole. Once they arrive there, they are taken into custody. Gabe and Mrs. Kringle soon find out.Noelle and Polly have to meet with a manager, Helen Rojas (Diana Maria Riva), to drop charges for supposedly soliciting on the grounds where they landed. Unfortunately, they can't get the reindeer to move, and Polly has to stay behind to watch them while Noelle goes off to find Nick by herself. She comes across a private investigator named Jake Hapman (Kinglsey Ben-Adir) to help her find him. Noelle tells the truth but comes off like a crazy person. Jake is cynical due to his divorce and having to share custody of his son Alex (Maceo Smedley). After helping Jake out with contacting Alex, she finds Helen and Polly, and then helps Helen connect with a handsome Petco manager that she has a crush on. This lets Noelle get store credit, and also a temporary place to stay.Gabe begins to take over the naughty-or-nice determination using his new app FALALA. He believes that only less than 3000 kids in the world can qualify as nice due to a bunch of petty mistakes that slide them closer to the naughty side. The rest of the North Pole is not happy with these calculations.Noelle goes to Jake's apartment and meets Alex. She gives him the store products as payment for the investigation on Nick. Jake says that no other major hospital, morgue, or prison has seen Nick, so they figure the last places to look are the shelters. She meets a deaf girl named Michelle (Shaylee Mansfield) and her mother. She charms the little girl and finds herself communicating in sign language, despite never learning it. They don't find Nick there. She continues hanging out with Jake and Alex, eventually finding that Nick is teaching at a yoga studio. On the way to find Nick, Jake expresses his insecurities as a single father to Noelle after they drop Alex off with his mom.Noelle arrives at the yoga studio and shocks Nick when she shows up. They are excited to see each other until Noelle tells him that the situation at the North Pole is serious. Nick has little interest in going back, even as Noelle stresses how the pressure is on her to bring him back. She goes back to Polly and is found by her pet from the North Pole, a small reindeer named Snowcone. He brings her a message from her mom to tell her how Gabe is ruining the way they run things at the Pole. When they try to run back and find Nick at the studio, they find it closed until after Christmas. Snowcone helps Noelle track Nick to a park where they are doing silent meditation, which becomes less silent when Noelle tries to bring Nick back. He rebuffs her again until she leaves him the note from their mom.Nick runs to the mall to find Noelle and Polly. He wants to help her but feels that he doesn't have the ""twinkle"" that makes Santa who he is. They pose as a mall Santa and elf to bring joy to kids. However, Nick finds it hard when he is met by grumpy children who found out they were naughty through Gabe's app. Meanwhile, Noelle tells Jake the truth about herself and her brother, but he doesn't buy it and leaves her. The other mall Santa that actually works there shows up, which leads to Noelle fighting him and a security guard, which gets her arrested.The situation at the Pole gets worse, and the word of kids being denied presents becomes big news. Noelle is put in a psych ward due to her supposed delusions. She expresses her sadness over her lack of purpose as an adult and living in the shadow of her father and brother. She is bailed out by Jake, who is not happy that Noelle knew personal things about them (through magic), but is still thankful for her efforts to make Alex happy. Nick and Polly then reveal the flying sleigh to a surprised Jake (and the doctor). Jake lets Noelle escape on the sleigh.The trio return to the Pole to have Nick re-assume his duties. However, Nick announces that he wants to pass on the mantle to Noelle. There are protests due to the thought of having a female Santa, but the elder elves decide that Noelle embodies all that makes a Santa - someone who inspires and spreads Christmas cheer. After delivering a heartfelt speech on what Christmas means to her, Noelle is officially declared the new Santa.Noelle begins her duties, but gets very nervous as she prepares herself. She messes up several times, such as going to the wrong houses, and it brings her spirit down, making her think she is not as capable of doing the job the way her father did. She stops at the shelter and accidentally wakes up Michelle and her mom. Michelle acknowledges Noelle as Santa, and soon, the other patrons do too. This lifts her spirits and enables her to do her job better. She finishes by taking Jake to spend time with Alex and his ex-wife, as the boy had wanted the whole time.With the North Pole doing much better, Noelle says that her life is even better now that she gets to give gifts instead of receive them."

Summer camp at Rim of the World has barely begun when four misfit teenagers--Alex, ZhenZhen, Dariush, and Gabriel--find they've got bigger problems to face than learning how to canoe and climb ropes: aliens suddenly invade the planet. Alone in a campground once teeming with people, the kids are unexpectedly entrusted with a key that carries the secret to stopping the invasion. With no adults or electronics to help guide the way, it's clear what they must do: band together, conquer their fears, and save the world.—Netflix Alex, a socially reclusive boy who recently lost his father in a fire, reluctantly attends a summer camp in southern California called ""Rim of the World"". He meets two other ""misfits"" - Zhen Zhen, an orphan from China, and Dariush, an outspoken boy from a rich family. One afternoon, while in a lake, Zhen Zhen wanders off into the woods, looking for the lookout point she had seen on a camp poster, while Alex attempts to follow. He comes across Dariush, who happens to be nearby answering the call of nature. Dariush mistakenly tries to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights by making him stand near a cliff edge, and Gabriel, a boy they hadn't seen at camp before, intervenes and helps stop Dariush from trying to 'cure' Alex's fear of heights. Zhen Zhen, hearing the commotion, comes back down and meets up with the boys. At that moment, they all receive alarming texts advising they immediately evacuate the area.While hurrying back, they find out that other campers have left the lake and they witness alien ships invading the valley. The kids head back to the camp, and afterward discover the camp to be empty of people - all except for Conrad, a camp counselor. Suddenly, a Dragon spacecraft fleeing the International Space Station lands heavily nearby. The dying astronaut inside the spacecraft gives Alex a key, with instructions that it should be taken to NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) facility in Pasadena, and that it was the only way to destroy the aliens. An alien appears with its ""dog"" and kills the astronaut. Alex and his friends try to hide out and Conrad gets killed, but the kids manage to elude the aliens and escape the camp.They make their way to the sheriff's office and discover an inmate, Lou, who has been left behind in the cells. Alex decides to release him before the group continues on their way to JPL. Later, the group encounters Marines who are evacuating civilians. The commander gratefully takes the key and puts the children on a bus to safety. However, alien ships attack the vehicle convoy and the soldiers are killed, whereupon Alex retrieves the key and the group sets out for JPL once more. During the night, after briefly taking refuge in Gabriel's old house, Gabriel explains that he is an escapee from juvie, where he was placed due to a misunderstanding at his mother's store, in which a man assumed Gabriel was attempting to steal his change at the deposit box, and unaware of Gabriel's dyscalculia. Sometime after, they are attacked by a gang of masked individuals, led by Lou. He agrees to let the kids go, but only if Alex gives him the key, which Lou thinks he can sell on the black market. Alex refuses and Lou attempts to kill Alex with a knife, but right before Lou attacks him, the alien from the camp appears and attacks them all. Lou is killed, but the kids manage to escape after trapping the alien in a backyard swimming pool.While they are walking in the forest, Dariush and Gabriel fight and Dariush reveals that his father lost their car dealership, meaning he will go to jail, hence the reason why Dariush was placed at camp. The kids walk into a mall and change clothes. After that, the group takes a car in the parking, which they discover Zhen Zhen is able to drive, to quickly journey the rest of the way to JPL, but they are again attacked by the pursuing alien. They abandon the vehicle while trying to escape the alien and realize that they left the key in the car. Dariush attempts to go alone to get the key, only to be injured by the alien in the process, but manages to get away with the key.

Les Misérables,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10199590/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A cop from the provinces moves to Paris to join the Anti-Crime Brigade of Montfermeil, discovering an underworld where the tensions between the different groups mark the rhythm. Assigned to work alongside unethical police veterans Chris (Alexis Manenti) and Gwada (Djebril Zonga) in Paris' Anti-Crime Brigade, Brigadier Stéphane Ruiz (Damien Bonnard) - a recent transplant to the working-class suburb of Montfermeil, where Victor Hugo wrote his famous novel Les Misérables - struggles to establish a working relationship with influential community leaders while attempting to maintain some semblance of peace between his disreputable team and the citizens of the local housing projects. When what should be a simple arrest goes tragically awry, the three officers must individually reconcile with the aftermath of their actions while angling to keep the neighborhood from retaliating with mob violence. Beginning as a Cesar-winning short film, the film was inspired by the 2005 riots in Paris. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize (in a tie with BACURAU) and was selected as France's entry for Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards.—Mae Moreno The film begins with images of the crowd in Paris celebrating the victory of the French team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, which had been perceived and celebrated in France as a moment of brotherhood between people of different social classes or ethnicities.Soon after, Stéphane Ruiz, a Police officer who recently moved to Paris and joined the anti-crime brigade, is assigned to work with squad leader Chris and brigadier Gwada on duty in the nearby city of Montfermeil. Chris often aggressively abuses his power on teenagers, with Gwada complacent with that abuse; while he feels unease, Stéphane doesn't interfere. Meanwhile, Issa, a known juvenile delinquent, steals Johnny, a lion cub, from a circus, causing its owner Zorro to go to a man known as ""the Mayor"" and threaten to return with firearms if Johnny is not returned. Chris and his squadron are tasked with finding and retrieving the cub.One of Issa's friends takes a picture of Issa with the cub and posts it on Instagram, leading Chris to find out that Issa is the culprit. They chase, capture and handcuff him, but he claims that the cub run away. Issa's friends then attack the trio, throwing objects at them to stop them from taking Issa in. When Issa tries to run away, Gwada, having accidentally teargassed himself during the chase, shoots him in the face with a flash-ball. Issa's friends scatter, but the squadron realize that they had been filmed by a drone, which escapes. While Stéphane wants to take a badly wounded Issa to a hospital, Chris and Gwada refuse, and instead the trio take him with them in their search of the drone's owner.The trio arrive at a local neighborhood contact of Chris, leaving Issa in their care and using information given to them by said contact to find Buzz, the teenager the drone belongs to, forcing him to flee before he can upload the video. Buzz, who still carries the drone's memory card, escapes the squadron and takes shelter with Salah, a restaurant owner and key member of the local Islamic community. Both the squadron and the mayor, having found out, arrive at Salah's restaurant. After a tense confrontation during which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah to give him the memory card, claiming that Issa's shooting was just an accident.After recovering Issa and the cub (who happened to be spotted near them), the squadron takes the two to Zorro. Although they make Issa apologize, Zorro attempts to lock the two inside a cage with a fully grown lion, scaring Issa into wetting himself and almost making Stéphane shoot the lion, although he eventually lets him go. Deciding that Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened, and to say that he slipped and fell if asked about his injury. In the evening, the characters involved in that day's event seemingly return to their normal lives, some with visible signs of distress and doubt; Issa, who had been told earlier that his father did not want him back home because of his behavior, sits alone on a ruined couch, traumatized. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada in a bar and tells him that he knows a flash-ball cannot be fired by accident, and that Gwada had therefore intentionally shot Issa. Gwada blames his stress and the children for overwhelming him, and Stéphane, while unconvinced, leaves Gwada with the card, telling him to ""do what you gotta do.""The next day, the squadron, while on patrol, get attacked by a small group led by Issa. They chase them, falling into Issa's trap and ending up assaulted by a much larger group of teenagers, leaving them trapped from all sides in a stairwell and fighting for their lives. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and the backup car Stéphane radios for gets immediately destroyed by the teenagers, forcing the backup policemen to flee. They also attack the mayor's office and end up clubbing him and throwing him down a set of stairs. Stéphane pounds on the nearest door begging for help, which, incidentally, is the door to Buzz's apartment; however, Buzz further locks the door. Issa lights a molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it, leading Stéphane to point his gun at him and warn him not to; the screen fades to black as both Issa and Stéphane try to decide what to do next, and a quote from Victor Hugo' Les Misérables appear: ""Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators."""

Blood Quantum,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7394674/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"The dead are coming back to life outside the isolated Mi'kmaq reserve of Red Crow, except for its Indigenous inhabitants who are strangely immune to the zombie plague. The term ""blood quantum"" refers to a colonial blood measurement system that is used to determine an individual's Indigenous status, and is criticized as a tool of control and erasure of Indigenous peoples. The words take on even more provocative implications as the title of Jeff Barnaby's sophomore feature, which grimly depicts an apocalyptic scenario where in an isolated ""Mi'gmaq"" community discover they are the only humans immune to a zombie plague. As the citizens of surrounding cities flee to the ""Mi'gmaq"" reserve in search of refuge from the outbreak, the community must reckon with whether to let the outsiders in - and thus risk not just the extinction of their tribe but of humanity, period. The severe and scathing portrait of post-colonial Indigenous life and culture that Barnaby previously captured in the acclaimed Rhymes for Young Ghouls here deftly collides with the iconography and violent hyperbole typical of the zombie genre. The Undead are spectacularly and gruesomely dispatched via samurai swords, chainsaws, shotguns, and makeshift axes, while the living - a terrific ensemble cast led by Michael Greyeyes (Woman Walks Ahead and Fear the Walking Dead) - endure the paranoid pressures that such dire straits foment. In this iteration, however, Barnaby takes full advantage of the canvas zombie films regularly afford for cultural critique, exploring racism, colonialism, and the very real threat of extinction that Indigenous communities have experienced for generations. Further accentuated by arresting animated chapter breaks that instill a cool comic-book aesthetic to its horrific proceedings, Blood Quantum is as powerful an entry into the annals of zombie cinema as the devastating conclusion to George Romero's 1968 original Night of the Living Dead, and a meaningful demonstration of how marginalized voices - when given the opportunity - can resurrect a tired genre with incendiary new life.—Toronto International Film Festival"

A same-sex couple move to a small town so they can enjoy a better quality of life and raise their 16 year-old daughter with the best social values.

Once in the new house late at night, Kayla is on her room and the couple is talking. From outside, a figure in a hood observes the house. The next day, Malik wakes up alone and starts unpacking their things, among them a computer. He is a ghostwriter, and he is writing a biography about a conservative man who believes in traditional values as in traditional family, etc. Then he takes out from a box a pair of glasses from the other young boy whom he was kissing in the eighties. When he is outside the house throwing the garbage, a man named Reinhart stares at him and then leaves without saying hello to Malik.Late at night, Malik wakes up hearing noises. He walks through the house as everyone is asleep but not seeing anything he goes back to sleep and the next morning he cuts a branch that hitting the window was causing the noises. Tiffany, their neighbor, knocks on their door the next morning to offer a flower, and she realizes that they are a gay couple. Later in the morning, Kayla is impressing some curriculum vitae to search for a work and Malik is alone at home working on his biography. He goes jogging and when he comes back he finds a graffiti with the word ""Faggots"" inside the house. Another flashback with the young boy shows him screaming while the other boy is outside the car. At night, he is covering the graffiti without telling to anyone what was there. They are celebrating that Kayla got a work dancing in family, and from outside, Reinhart is watching the house.Late at night, he is shocked because a picture of the family he put on a board is missing. The next day in the morning Malik is talking to someone by phone very upset about the fact that the world has not changed the view they have about homosexuality because of the graffiti, and it is revealed that he has installed a security system. Then, Aaron arrives and he hangs up quickly. Then they go to a party with the neighbors, where they meet Tiffany's husband, Marshall. At the party, Malik sees again Reinhart and when he looks again where he was, he is not there anymore. Already at the house, Malik wakes up again, hearing noises. This time he takes a bat and walks through the house. When he arrives to the waiting room, he gets very frightened when he sees a figure watching him from outside. In the porch, the figures runs out of his view and the alarm system begins to sound. Malik follows the figure outside the house, it is Reinhart, and this one gives a piece of paper to Malik, and he says not to telling anyone. When Aaron shows up at the balcony, the man pretends to have lost his keys, and he goes away walking. Aaron gets very angry about the alarm system, and then they go to sleep.The next morning, Malik checks the piece of paper, but he can not see anything on it. On the other hand, Kayla has made a new friend, Tiffany's son, and she spends the day with him playing video games and smoking. Later that night, when Malik is still working on her biography, he sees something strange through the window. He watches over Reinhart's house, and there is a group of people in a circle, swinging left to right repeatedly. As Malik approaches the window to better see what it is happening across the street, Marshall appears on the left side of the window, contemplating the group. Malik then takes Kayla's Polaroid and look through the lens. The group has started to holding hands in the air and one of them approaches the window and is looking to Malik's direction, just standing there. Malik then turn off all the lights and the man standing still looks at Marshall and they both closes the curtains.The next day Reinhart is dead and as Malik and Aaron are contemplating the ambulance to go away, Marshall and Tiffany arrives. The aforementioned tells the couple that the nephew of Reinhart, Matthew, called them, and they performed a kind of ritual to say goodbye. Later the same morning, Malik enters a neighbor's house-Reinhart's house-the one where he saw the ritual. He takes a frame with a picture and at that precise moment someone enters the house. Malik leaves the frame fall to the floor out of fear and although the nephew, Matthew, sees the frame in the floor, he can not see anyone there. Kayla decides to skip work and go with Marshall's son to the bridge they had the accident with the bird.That same night, Malik and Aaron are dining in Tiffany and Marshall's house. Malik wants to go to the bathroom, but he enters a room full of books instead. He looks through the room, and then he sees a picture of what it seems to be the son of Marshall and Tiffany, but in the frame he reads 1792. Later, Marshall enters the room, and he explains to him that the man is called Richard, and it was his great great something, and they leave the room. Late at night, Malik is working in his book and a car arrives from behind with the lights on, he approaches the window not able to see anything because of the lights. Suddenly, he finds himself outside the house and another flashback shows the young boys on the back of the car. As the other boy is putting on his glasses, from the other car descend two man, one of them with a bat, and they advance to the young boys' car. When the one with the bat breaks the window where the other young boy sits, Malik wakes up in his studio from what it is supposed to be a nightmare.The next day, Matthew knocks to the door and Malik opens. He says that he needs to speak to him about his grandparent, and Malik lets them in. They sit in the waiting room, and he tells him that his grandparent was not good mentally. Matthew asks Malik if he gave something to him, but he lies and says no. Seconds after, Matthew appears near to him-seconds before he was across the table-and he tells him that they told him it was a suicide. He starts crying, and he approaches Malik and starts hugging him and caressing him. But then Aaron arrives and they both get up the couch quickly. Later, when they are about to sleep Aaron and Malik talk about Matthew a little and then Aaron turns off the lights, as the room is pitch dark they start to kiss each other. Seconds later, they hear Kayla screaming and in panic. When they arrive to Kayla's room, she is still screaming and covered in blood. When Malik enters the room, and he looks at the ceiling, he sees a big stain of blood. Malik goes to the attic, and he sees a bunch of dead animals, and he throws them into the garbage while Kayla takes a shower.Malik is more and more mentally affected by the situation, not talking much over dinner for example and having more nightmares. While having the last one, they are a bunch of people outside the house with hoods watching the house. Then he is in the bathroom with Aaron taking a shower together, but Kayla knocks at the door, and then he is alone, and he has been in the shower like an hour. Later, he achieves to decipher the note the grandparent of Matthew gave to him. He sees a lot of numbers-Sudoku like but without the lines- and he goes to the library to check on the Internet and after consulting a lot of newspapers he arrives to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the town, and he asks Aron to move out, but he does not think it is necessary. Then Malik explains to him that Reinhart was trying to warn them and that the note he gave to him was full of dates. Specifically, one that leads to a murder of a lesbian couple ten years ago. When Malik tries to say that Tiffany and Marshall did not say anything to them, Aaron tells him that they already mentioned that to him but because of Malik isolation, he never speaks to them.After the conversation with Aaron, Malik speaks by phone with Liam, and he tries to calm down Malik, telling him that the numbers do not make sense. It is clear that at this point Malik is more and more paranoid. The next morning he goes out for a run and people in town stares at him. That same night, as he arrives to chapter two of his book, he goes to the house of the lesbian couple. There he sees a kind of ghost of a woman and thanks to her Malik finds a series of tapes. When he comes back to the house, he can not find his hard drive and Aaron is outside. When they meet him, the latter gives him a series of Polaroids in a sexual attitude with Matthew-the nephew of Reinhart-. Aaron decides to kick him out of the house, but Malik insists in that everything that is happening is because of the people in town. When Malik enters the house again, is very angry and without noticing, one of the tapes goes under the table of his computer. He looks at the PC and sees that there is a CD with his work inside the drive, so he takes it before leaving.Later, he takes Kayla from School where she had an incident and at night he goes outside Aaron's house in his car and stays there a while. Then, he decides to go to Marshall's home and goes inside to take a drink and talk about the breakup. Marshall says to him that he has his hard drive, and he saw ""the folder"". Malik, apparently, does not know what he is talking about. Again, when Marshall enters a room and Malik goes to him, he appears behind him sitting in a chair in another room, as Matthew did. He keeps telling him that his secret is safe and that he has a problem. Malik takes the hard drive and gets out of the house.In the next scene, Malik is arriving to a motel. The first thing he does is looking through the window to see is there is someone there. Then he takes out from his jacket a book with a spiral on its spine. Without Marshall noticing, he took a book from his library. A couple of seconds later, he enters the bathroom to take some medication and a then a gun, and he goes again to the bedroom. This time, when he tries to talk to Liam, the operator says that it could not be possible to connect with him because the number may not exist. When he hangs up and looks over the window, a shadow of a satanic figure is projected in the curtains-a sort of human figure with goat head and horns-. Seconds later, a couple is talking about finding the keys and the shadow transforms in someone leaning to take them. When Malik looks back to the room, the figure of the ghost woman appears again, and she frights him, but she disappears within seconds.Malik starts to watch the tapes he found inside the house and Hannah, one of the women of the lesbian couple, documented everything in those tapes. He is talking with Liam again and as the tapes advance it is clear that the same thing that happened to Hannah it seems to happened to them; for example the graffiti with ""Dykes"" instead of ""Faggots"". Malik arrives to the conclusion that each ten years someone is ""selected"" and something bad happens to them, but it is not clear what. Inside the book, looking for clues, he sees the human with horns figure, a flower Tiffany offered to him when they first meet and what it seems to be satanic stuff. He also finds the picture with Aaron and him as drag queens-the one which disappeared mysteriously-and with their eyes crossed out. At that precise moment, his head starts aching a lot, and he goes to the bathroom to take his medication. There he realizes that ""them"" changed it. He wants to tell to Liam, but again the disconnected number or non-existent appears. In the video, mother and daughter speak to each other and then Malik remembers Kayla. He takes his car, and he arrives to Aaron's house.Once at the house, there is a sort of party/reunion, some people who Malik does not know start to laugh as he is screaming calling for Kayla and Aaron. Tiffany finally receives him, and she says to him that it is a very special night. There are people recording everything with a camera and Tiffany continues to speak, adding that everything that it is happening tonight is for her-Kayla-. Malik finds Aaron, and this one tells him that he has been missing for a week, then Marshall welcomes him and Malik shoots him saying that he is protecting Kayla. His son appears crying and screaming at Malik, and Kayla is watching everything from the second floor. The last scene of the sequence shows a birthday cake party with the writing ""Sweet 16"" and a draw of Aaron, Malik, and Kayla on it.Malik is now in prison and Aaron goes to visit him. The latter says to him that he and Kayla will go away to the city. Malik adds that he must run away and that he may not understand it, but he did what he had to do. Then, Malik tells Aaron that he could speak to Liam but, although not clearly said, it seems that Liam may be dead because it was the young boy who was beaten in the eighties. Then Aaron leaves and Malik stays in the floor crying that he had no choice. Another flashback to the eighties shows the young boy being beaten with a bat and left, at least unconscious, on the floor. Malik gets out of the car and asks for help, then he takes Liam's glasses. Back in the present, Aaron is talking with Kayla about overcome the situation. The aforementioned goes then to the Malik's studio, and he sees the tape that, unknowingly to Malik, was under the table, and he starts watching it. At a given moment, Hannah is talking about someone entering their home with Marshall and Tiffany, and from the distance her daughter with Tiffany's son can be seen. Everyone in the tape looks exactly as if time had not passed. At a given moment, Aaron's face very shocked is shown and in the background through the windows we see a bunch of people dressed in black with hoods.Now Malik is sleeping in the cell and Marshall arrives-he is alive indeed-. Then Aaron, after watching the tape, knocks on Kayla's room. Back in the cell, Malik says to Marshall that they could take him instead of Kayla, but Marshall says that it is too late. Aaron is trying that Kayla opens the door, when he hears some noises in the waiting room he goes there to check and the people in hoods are standing there looking at him. He goes back to Kayla's door, this time hitting it with his shoulder. When he finally arrives to open the door, back in the prison again, Marshall starts explaining how they make it work: Malik tried to escape, and he had drugs in his system for another relapse. Then he killed Kayla, his husband and then, himself. In the house the people in hoods are in the same floor that Aaron, and when this one looks inside the room he sees the body of his dead daughter over the bed. Her torso is wide open and Tiffany's son, apparently, eating her guts seated on the bed. Aaron starts to cry horrified, and Tiffany approaches him commenting how beautiful it is the scene. In the cell, Marshall continues telling that because he is different, people fear him, and they will not believe that he is innocent. Marshall adds that it is a human condition to feel fear, and they only exploit this.The last sequence of the movie shows Tiffany, Marshall, and their son as a Hindi family arrives next to their house. Then it is shown that Malik documented everything, as Hannah did, and he recorded everything on the CD he could save from the PC. He put it on a music CD case, explaining everything for the next family to find it in the attic. The last scene before the credits appear is one of the females of the new family illuminating the attic with her smartphone and finding the CD in a corner while Malik pronounces: ""hope is never silent."""
Blood Vessel,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8009938/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Lifeboat survivors board a German boat that's crawling with vampires during World War II. Somewhere in the North Atlantic, late 1945. A life raft adrift at sea, and in it, the survivors of a torpedoed hospital ship: With no food, water, or shelter, all seems lost - until an abandoned German minesweeper drifts ominously towards them, giving them one last chance at survival.—Jordan Prosser In late 1945, near the end of World War II, a life raft is adrift in the North Atlantic, carrying the survivors of a hospital ship that was hit by a German torpedo and sunk. The survivors - American cook Bigelow, American mechanic Jackson, British nurse Jane Prescott, British codebreaker Gerard Faraday, Australian soldier Sinclair, Russian sniper Alexander Teplov, and Malone, the American captain of the hospital ship - have been adrift for days and have run out of food when suddenly a Nazi minesweeper drifts by. Teplov uses the last bullet in Malone's rifle to shoot one of the ship's cables and the survivors use it to climb up onto the ship's deck, but while Malone is trying to board, the ladder snaps and he falls into the water and is killed by the ship's propellers. The remaining survivors investigate the seemingly-abandoned ship, with Sinclair, Teplov, and Bigelow going to the bridge and finding that the steering wheel has been chained in place. They also find the body of one of the German crew, decapitated and with huge veins extending out of his neck and sticking to the wall. Below-deck, Jackson checks out the engine and finds bodies that seem to have been burned to death, and also discovers that the boiler has failed and the ship could explode at any time if the engine keeps running, so he shuts off the engine, leaving the ship dead in the water.The survivors regroup in the galley and discover a young girl hiding there. The girl is frightened and reflexively bites Jane when Jane attempts to reach out to her, but Jane calms her down and comforts her. When the girl finally speaks, Teplov identifies her language as Romanian despite not being able to fully understand it, and the girl introduces herself as Mya. Mya leads the survivors to a heavy locked door further below-deck and the group hears a man speaking German on the other side. They cautiously open the door and find a surviving German crew member wielding a Luger, who becomes terrified at the sight of Mya. He fires at Mya multiple times, wounding Teplov's leg and hitting Jackson in the head, killing him; Teplov kills the German survivor with a knife. Bigelow and Sinclair investigate the room that the German survivor was holed up in and find multiple large wooden boxes, a box of gold, and a box filled with crucifixes and transparent glass containers shaped like grenades that are filled with water. Jane, Teplov, and Mya return to the galley where Jane treats Teplov's bullet wound; Faraday sneaks off on his own and attempts to reach someone on the ship's shortwave radio; and Sinclair and Bigelow look through the quarters of the ship's dead captain, finding a wealth of photographs and documents showing Nazi soldiers unearthing ancient artifacts, including what appear to be multiple sarcophagi. They also find a thick tome showing images of monstrous creatures. Bigelow decides to go back to the storage room to take some of the gold for himself, and also opens up one of the large wooden boxes, which contains one of the sarcophagi from the photographs. He breaks the chains holding it shut and opens it, hoping to find more treasure, but instead finds a slumbering creature with a bat-like face. The creature suddenly awakens and kills Bigelow; Sinclair encounters the creature as it attacks Bigelow but manages to lock the storage room door, trapping it inside. The creature's awakening triggers a transformation in Mya, who is revealed to be of the same species; she suddenly attacks Jane, but Teplov shoots her, scaring her off.Sinclair reunites with Teplov and Jane and informs them of the monster in the storage room; meanwhile, Faraday makes contact with a German over the radio and offers up classified British information in exchange for rescue, but is attacked by Mya. Sinclair, Teplov, and Jane look over the documents and film in the captain's cabin, and when Teplov looks at the tome, he recognizes the monsters depicted inside as Strigoi, fairytale creatures that are said to feed on the blood of their victims and have the power to shape-shift and command the minds of others. In the storage room, the male strigoi opens the second sarcophagus and bites into his own hand, spilling blood into the open mouth of the female strigoi sleeping within, awakening her. Sinclair, Teplov, and Jane resolve to find Faraday and then kill the strigoi using the holy armaments in the storage room. They find Faraday, but he has been bitten by Mya, which allows the Patriarch of the strigoi to psychically control him. Speaking through Faraday, the Patriarch taunts and then attacks the remaining survivors, but Jane kills Faraday by stabbing him. The survivors then go searching for Mya. Jane finds her and lures her to the upper deck where Sinclair and Teplov trap her in a small room that they have doused in gasoline. Teplov then drops a lighter through a hole in the wall, igniting the gasoline and burning Mya to death. As she burns, the Patriarch initiates a psychic connection with Jane through the small bite she received when they first discovered Mya, which has slowly been growing worse. Jane slips away from Sinclair and Teplov and goes below-deck, freeing the pair of strigoi; the Patriarch then bites her neck.Teplov goes back to the storage room to arm himself with the holy weapons stored there, but is ambushed by the Patriarch and bitten in the neck. He manages to escape by wounding the Patriarch with one of the holy water grenades and a flare gun recovered from the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Sinclair, while searching for Jane, encounters his estranged wife on the upper deck. He breaks down upon seeing her, but Teplov finds them and sees that it is actually the Matriarch using her powers on Sinclair. Teplov breaks the illusion by firing the flare gun into the air, getting Sinclair's attention at the last second and saving his life. Teplov then wounds the Matriarch with the heavy mounted machine gun on the ship's highest deck and Sinclair finishes her off by decapitating her with an axe. The pair hear a distant ship approaching, alerted by the flare gun, so they agree to find Jane and then destroy the Nazi ship by detonating a warhead in the munitions storage in order to kill the Patriarch. They go to the munitions room and find it full of infected German crew, but they fight through the strigoi and kill them all. Teplov then reveals his neck wound from the Patriarch and decides to stay behind to detonate the warhead himself, ordering Sinclair to escape with Jane. Sinclair goes back to the upper deck and finds Jane, who appears disoriented and tells Sinclair to leave her behind, but he ignores her pleading. Teplov attempts to detonate the warhead by bludgeoning it with an axe and is stopped at the last second by the arrival of the Patriarch, who freezes Teplov's body with a psychic attack, but Teplov frees himself from control by pressing a crucifix into his neck wound, severing the psychic connection between him and the Patriarch. He slams his axe into the warhead, detonating it and causing a chain of explosions across the ship as Sinclair and Jane jump overboard. Sinclair dives underwater to rescue Jane, and begins yelling and waving at the approaching British ship, but when Jane regains consciousness, she is revealed to have been infected by the Patriarch, and bites Sinclair's neck, killing him and then letting him sink into the ocean. Jane is rescued by the British sailors."

Later, Enid, a brothel owner, sees the Connolly knife in Gorski's shack.Local policeman Brennan asks to borrow the Connolly's boat, indicating that a body has washed up on shore. Priscilla is terrified that it is Gorski but it turns out be a woman named Dee, who worked for Enid.

The officers are sure that Gorski must be the murderer. Meanwhile, Alexis, one of Enid's working girls, knowing Enid owed Dee money, believes Enid had her killed. Enid blackmails the Connolly sisters to bring back the money they took from Gorski's shack in exchange for the knife she found there. The sisters decide to confess everything to the police the following day.

Brennan has drinks with a friend and learns that Mary Beth had been seen with Gorski the night he disappeared.The Connolly sisters go to Enid and return the money. She tells them how much she misses their mother and how their mother left the brothel business to protect the two of them. She offers them some of the money and tells them that they could work for her after it runs out. When they refuse the money, Enid turns angry, calling them names before drunkenly collapsing. The girls get the knife and leave. Alexis, having overheard the whole thing, enters Enid's room and smothers her to death with a pillow. She takes the money and leaves town with one of the other girls from the brothel. Doreen notices something in the water.Gail comes to see Coletti about Oceanview. The next morning he informs Brennan that they're going to close down Oceanview. They see Priscilla and Mary Beth walking down the street, but Brennan says he isn't interested in Priscilla anymore. The sisters pass by Gail and Doreen, who are singing ""Blow the Man Down"", and then see Susie washing out the cooler which had contained Gorski's body. Susie smiles at them.(copied from Wikipedia)"
Earthquake Bird,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8178486/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An enigmatic translator with a dark past is brought in for questioning after an ex-pat friend, who came between her and her photographer boyfriend, ends up missing and presumed dead. In 1989 Tokyo, Lucy Fly, an enigmatic expat haunted by a painful past, enters into an intense relationship with Teiji, a handsome yet similarly troubled local photographer. Lucy's imperturbable exterior begins to crack when a naive newcomer, Lily Bridges, becomes entangled in their lives and ends up missing - suspected dead. Lucy is a buttoned-up, MUJI-clad translator who has been in Japan for five years and is desperate to blend in. Her reticent nature hides old scars. There's also the fact that people around her keep dying - accidentally or otherwise. After a street encounter with hot photographer Teiji, she quickly finds herself under his spell, despite all the warning signs. And the pot is stirred further when American nurse Lily - all blowzy sexual confidence and cultural naivety - arrives in town and Lucy experiences some frightening impulses.—London Film Festival Set in 1989 Tokyo, Lucy Fly (Alicia Vikander), a young female expat, is suspected of murder when her friend Lily (Riley Keough) goes missing in the wake of a tumultuous love triangle with Teiji (Naoki Kobayashi).
Lucy works as a translator at Sasagawa. Detective Oguchi (Ken Yamamura) picks up Lucy from her office after Lily's dead body is found a few days after she is reported missing. Lucy is questioned, but remains calm. She was the last person who saw Lily before she disappeared. Lucy says she went after Lily after she left home in the evening as she had something that belonged to her. But she says she never caught up with Lily.Lucy has been in Japan for 5 yrs and 2 months. No family in Japan. Father is an electrician and she has 7 brothers. She has no boyfriend in Japan.
In flashback we see Lucy met Teiji, who is a photographer and who photographed her without her permission. They got talking and eventually went on a date. Teiji takes more photos of her and they share a shelter when there is a mild earthquake.
Lucy takes violin lessons. Lucy met Teiji first. She was then introduced to Lily, who was a new joiner at her company. Lucy was shy and introvert, while Lily is loud and extroverted. Bob (Jack Huston) is Lucy's friend who introduced Lily to her.Lucy has a work friend named Natsuko (Kiki Sukezane), to whom she tells about how she is dating Teiji. Lucy and Teiji have sex after they learn about each other macabre fascination with death.
Lucy takes Lily apartment hunting and they start spending more time with each other. She tells Lily about Teiji. Lucy finds out that Lily was a trained nurse back in DC. She is oddly intimidated by that. Lily suggests that she wants to meet Teiji.
Lucy asks Teiji to sell his photos, but he is very cold to the idea and brushes her off. Lucy goes back to his studio and looks at his photograph folder to find that Teiji has taken photos of one more woman before her. Teiji is offended and Lucy apologizes profusely after Teiji tells her that this woman Sachi, was his muse before Lucy.Lucy takes Lily to the noodle place where Teiji works. Lily then starts spending nights over at Lucy's and observes that Teiji doesn't come to Lucy's apartment. Lucy invites Lily to an art festival where Bob is playing with his band. Bob thought he and Lily had a thing, but he tells Lucy that Lily gave him all the signals but then lost interest in him.
Lucy sees Lily dancing with Teiji at the festival. Then the 3 go together for a picnic and that night they end up having a 3 threesome at Lucy's place. But in reality Lily and Teiji had sex. The next day Lucy gets really mad at Lily and Teiji when they leave her behind (she was sleeping) to go for some sightseeing. Lucy is really angry and the next day she finds Teiji taking photos of Lily.Lily comes over to apologize and we see Lucy running after Lily in the rain, and the flashback ends.
Lucy admits to Oguchi that she murdered Lily, but the body found by the police is not Lily's. Lucy admits that she lied about killing Lily but said she wanted to kill her. Lucy is released. She goes to Teiji's studio and once again breaks into his cabinet to find Lily's folder and finds the last photo, which is of Lily dead and her head smashed in.
Lucy takes the photo to Oguchi, but cant find him at the station. She goes back home to find Teiji waiting for her. Teiji wants Lucy to run away with him, when she refuses, he attacks her. Lucy kills Teiji with a glass vase."
The Hard Way,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9815714/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"After learning his brother died on a mission in Romania, a former soldier teams up with two allies to hunt down a mysterious enemy and exact revenge. Michael Jai White and Luke Goss are in ""The Hard Way,"" an extremely predictable movie that just never gets the viewer engaged in the story. The White Character ""Payne"" learns his brother died on a mission in Romania, just when he his brother was expected to come home and be introduced to his young nephew who works at Payne's Bar in New York. Payne a former and very capable soldier teams up with allies Goss who plays ""Mason"" to hunt down the killer and get revenge in Romania.Luke Goss, Michael Jai White and Randy Couture star in this lack luster and seemingly long, very boring and never hitting home under the coot ledge of director, Keoni Waxman, movie. Three capable actors directed in this sleepy disorganized manner that never showcases these awesome actors talents and capabilities. The Hard Way is not a spectacular movie in anyway and never enough action to keep fans entertained throughout.Interesting elements abound, like the classic 1967 fast back Mustang Mason Drives slowly whenever shown, the Sniper Rifle and interesting handguns like the white handled presumably Ivory handled 1911 .45 pistol of Couture character Toro/ Briggs uses. The on-scene location / sets are also interesting and very elaborate.Michael Jai White is at his best with his fight scenes as in real life he is black belt in 7 styles of Martial Arts and it shows. Having trained with Segal and Van Damn in the past White does not disappoint in his fighting scenes abilities. The director used poor fight choreographers for all the action scenes and show poorly, fight scenes are good, not great. Gratuitous violence abound as well. The scene where he takes on two mob type assailants who want to take over his New York bar is with disappointment and is touted as the highlight of the entire movie. This scene makes no sense actually and is leaving the viewer scratching their head and wondering, ""huh?"" The climactic fight scene is also foolish as well. Here Couture shoots blanks from his Ivory Handled 1911 .45 three instances and each time Payne gets up off the ground and then they have their final physical hand to hand combat. Simultaneously in another part of this location a knife fight between Goss one of Toro's last surviving bad guys is too long and foolish. Predictably Goss and White characters triumph with no injuries.Plot Synopsis is a sad feature film that drags on and on with no solid story and little entertainment from start to finish. Many small old type plots with almost good newer longer plots which are miss matched and poorly organized. There are attempts to show character definition but never reaches that goal.The actors shown here in this Netflix movie are good group, but the sleepy director just never delivers. Story is weak. The characterizations are long and unsubstantial with overall poor outcome. No car chase, no love interest that makes sense, the bad guy evil depiction/s wherever shown are laughable. Especially the pliers and tooth extraction routine.The viewer just doesn't ""feel it."" Overall, The Hard Way is not worth watching and there will be disappointment to those that do. The plot synopsis is one action adventure movie that missed the mark despite the good actors and great location. - Martin Snytsheuvel"

Disappearance at Clifton Hill,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5919756/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Follows a troubled young woman returning to her hometown of Niagara Falls, where the memory of a long-ago kidnapping quickly ensnares her.

Middleton delivers a stellar and complex performance as a woman obsessed with her troubled past while trying to uncover a crime to which she's convinced she was an accomplice. Shin and co-writer James Schultz craft a sharp, suspenseful drama, equipped with twists and turns, culminating with a climax that will leave you thinking for days.—Toronto International Film Festival After a long absence, Abby returns to her hometown of Niagara Falls, ON on the death of her mother, her estate going to Abby and her younger sister Laure, who works in security at the Niagara Falls Casino. While their mother was in the process of selling their ""home"", what is now the rundown Rainbow Inn, a motel, Abby, against Laure's wishes, wants to keep it at least for the time being in Abby wanting to see if she/they can operate it. Abby's return also brings up remembrances of when she was seven years old when she, while the family was picnicking in a nearby remote area, secretly witnessed a seemingly abused one-eyed boy she encountered being abducted i.e. beaten and thrown unwillingly into the trunk of a car by two adults. While she had cursorily mentioned the incident to a few people at the time, she was dismissed in she routinely talking fancifully. Indeed, Abby, as an adult, has lived a life of lies. When she comes upon some evidence that the boy's disappearance may be connected to the Charles Lake Company (CLC), a family business now headed by its third generation, Charles Lake III, which controls much of Niagara Falls and which was the interested purchaser of the Rainbow Inn, Abby decides to investigate on her own in she again being dismissed by the police when she brings her concerns to them, potentially at risk to her own life if she gets too close to the truth.—Huggo In the opening sequence, Abby, a seven-year-old girl, while walking around the woods by the water, sees a boy with an eyepatch being attacked by two adults and stuffed into a car trunk. It happens just up the hill and through the weeds of where she is standing, but it's clear enough. While her oblivious family takes a group picture minutes later, she sees the car drive away.Twenty - five years later, Abby remains haunted by what she saw, and possibly also deeply damaged. Abby is regarded as a pathological liar, capable of concocting fantastical stories and black sheep of her family, but she reluctantly returns to her eccentric hometown to help her sister settle the affairs of their late mother. This includes finalizing the sale of her mom's rundown motel to the richest family in town.While overseeing the family hotel in its last few weeks of ownership, Abby starts to retrace the steps of this unfinished story that her sister Laure considered to be just one of Abby's fantastical yarns. But it's not long before Abby finds different pieces that guide her more and more to the event, starting with finding out the name of the boy who disappeared. The locals believe that the boy committed suicide. When revisiting the site of disappearance, she meets Walter who scuba dives for stuff that finds its way from the falls, oversees a UFO-themed café and has a conspiracy podcast that has been talking about the events Abby has been fixated on. A visit to the library and a few conversations later, Abby discovers a VHS tape promoting a mother and father magician duo known as the Magnificent Moulins, a tiger and a report of their son committing suicide. Their son looked exactly like the missing boy. Abby wonders why was it deemed a suicide if the police never recovered the boy's (Alex) body from the gorge. Abby also reveals to her sister Laure that back in Toronto she checked into a facility after her constant lying lead eventually to break-up with her boyfriend.While doing her own diving into the story, she encounters a guy who claims to own the town, Charlie Lake III.

Laure who works at a casino helps Abby get more information about Bev Mole (Moulin's assistant) who could be complicit in Alex's disappearance.On the pretext of inviting her back to casino, Abby has Bev visit her motel. Bev's paralyzed husband reveals to Abby that Alex was injured/mauled by the tiger during the magicians' act and was asked to be hidden away by Moulins. Bev and he tried to blackmail the Moulins in return for their silence on Alex's mistreatment.

The husband says that Alex was supposed to be taken to their farm but Bev never took him there and police later told them that the boy committed suicide. He believes that Charles Lake II had Alex murdered. The wife says that Alex was a weak kid and probably saw suicide as a means to escape the torture of being in a cage with the tiger. While crossing the border back to Canada, she is caught by the border security.While in custody, Laure is informed that Abby had been in Arizona, Phoenix for the past 18 months and pretended to have retrograde amnesia, trying to get the state to issue her an Id.

Otherhood,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4180560/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A grounded, soulful, celebratory comedy about three mothers and their adult sons. The film explores the stage after motherhood, Otherhood, when you have to redefine your relationship with your children, friends, spouse, and most importantly, yourself. On Mother's Day, feeling marginalized and forgotten, longtime friends Carol (Angela Bassett), Gillian (Patricia Arquette) and Helen (Felicity Huffman) decide to drive to New York City to reconnect with their adult sons, and in the process, they realize their sons are not the only ones whose lives need to change. A journey to relate becomes a journey of rediscovery that forces these women to redefine their relationships with their children, friends, spouses and most importantly, themselves.—Netflix ""Otherhood"" captures the highs and lows of female friendship, marriage, and motherhood from the perspective of three women whose sons grew up together in Poughkeepsie. This year, on Mother's Day, feeling marginalized and forgotten, the women decide to drive to New York and make their sons love them again, and in the process, they realize their sons are not the only ones whose lives need to change. Carol Walker (Angela Bassett)'s first Mother's Day as a widower makes her realize her empty nest is more like a crater. She's tired of sending herself flowers from her handsome, successful son, Matt (Sinqua Walls), so she goes to NY to make him love her again.

Gillian Lieberman (Patricia Arquette) is worried about her son, Daniel (Jake Hoffman), who hasn't contacted her since she voiced disapproval of his last girlfriend Erin (Heidi Gardner) months ago.

Helen Halston (Felicity Huffman), on her second marriage (but still angry about the end of the first) knows that her son Paul (Jake Lacy) is gay, and he knows she knows, but they've never talked about it.

She also never wanted to be a grandmother (she doesn't want to feel that old, plus she secretly suspected she never would be one), so finding out she might be a grandmother changes her whole outlook on the second half of life. ""Otherhood"" is for all of the mothers and sons and daughters in the world who grow up, but don't outgrow their need for love."

Semper Fi,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7042838/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A police officer who serves in the Marine Corps Reserves is faced with an ethical dilemma when it comes to helping his brother in prison. The story sees Courtney as Cal, a by-the-book police officer who makes ends meet as a Marine Corps reservist along with his rowdy and inseparable group of childhood friends. When Cal's younger, reckless half-brother Oyster (Wolff) accidentally kills a guy in a bar fight and tries to flee, Cal forces him to face the music. After an unfair sentence, Oyster fights for survival in a dangerous Pennsylvania prison system while Cal and his friends are deployed to fight the lethal insurgency in Iraq. Overseas, Cal's world is shaken, and after he barely makes it home alive, he resolves to break Oyster out of prison - no matter the cost. Cal is a by-the-book police officer who, along with his close-knit group of childhood friends, makes ends meet as a Marine Corps reservist. When Cal's reckless younger half-brother, Oyster, is arrested after a bar fight and given an unfair prison sentence, Cal - driven by his loyalty to family and fierce code of honor - fights for Oyster in this gripping tale of brotherhood and sacrifice. In 2005, close friends Cal (Jai Courtney), Milk (Beau Knapp), Jaeger (Finn Wittrock), Snowball (Arturo Castro) and Oyster (Nat Wolff) bowl at Westside Lanes in Bridgewater, NY. Their nicknames are carved into their respective ball. After some roughhousing, an employee named Tony threatens to have them removed, but they show him Cal's badge-he is the police. Cal makes a deal with Tony to buy drinks for them all if Oyster can bowl 3 strikes-otherwise they'll leave. Oyster's third roll is a miss because he does it blindfolded, but with much laughter and joking, Tony doesn't throw them out. The camaraderie is palpable.In their day jobs, Cal, who's full name is Chris Callahan, is a police officer. Milk, who's last name is Milkowski, is a fire fighter at the Ernest J Cooper Memorial Fire Station. Jaeger is an auto body detailer. Snowball is a dockside crane operator. And Oyster, who is Cal's half-brother, works at a diner.Together, all five serve in the Marine Corps Reserve at Fort Drum, where Cal is their Staff Sergeant. Oyster picks fights, forgets his cap and is generally reckless during their time there, which earns him time cleaning toilets. The resentment between brothers builds. They're in training because they'll soon be called to active duty.At home, the brothers argue. Oyster has had prior felony convictions, and Cal reminds him that one more will land him back in prison. Oyster spouts his big dreams, which Cal feels are empty. Cal has pulled his life together, something he wishes Oyster would do. Their arguing turns into a scuffle, where Oyster accidentally gets hurt. Cal tries to make amends to his brother through a closed bedroom door as Oyster sulks and plucks his guitar.Late at night, the five friends meet up at Old Point Bar. They talk up two girls, Carrie and Val, to whom Cal shows them words tattooed on his forearms: Semper Fidelis. Cal and Jaeger spot Jaeger's ex-girlfriend, Clara, who's in town, but they're rebuffed by her when they go over to chat. Jaeger is rude. And Oyster wants $10 to buy drinks for Carrie and Val, but Cal won't do it.Cal, Milk and Jaeger head out into the night for a friendly race home after Cal warns Oyster not to get too drunk or violent. Oyster finally gets the money from another friend, Dwyer (""DJ""), but he's too late: he's been edged by out another guy, Ben Daley. Oyster shoves Ben aside and hands the drinks to the girls.When Oyster goes to use the restroom, Ben and a friend come in and pick a fight. Ben punches Oyster in the stomach twice before Oyster retaliates by hitting him in the head. Ben falls backward, hits his head hard on a porcelain urinal and lands on the floor. In a horrendous turn of events, Oyster's recklessness has finally had major consequences. On the floor lies a still Ben, with blood coming out of his ear as Oyster worriedly urges him to get up.At home studying Arabic in the quiet, Cal gets the call. He dresses hurriedly and races to the bar in his cruiser. His brother has fled the scene. Yelling Oyster's name back house, he finds the bedroom drawers empty. He finally spots his brother's Bronco at Snowball's apartment and calls it in. Despite Snowball's heated intervention and witness as to the true nature of the accident, Officer Callahan does his duty and forces Oyster out, calling him by his real name, Teddy.Scared and panicked beyond distraught, Oyster takes off. Callahan tackles him and places him in handcuffs as other officers arrive. As Oyster is being arrested, a senior officer arrives and announces that Ben - who was last seen bleeding from the ear - has died. Realizing this now means Oyster could go down for a murder, Cal is visibly distraught about apprehending his brother. While being placed in a squad car, Oyster shouts profanities at Callahan. Cal is grief stricken.Eight months later, Callahan, Snowball, Jaeger and Milk are on full active duty in the Mosul province of Iraq. They watch casualties climb from remote IED detonation, so they improvise with the use of a radio jammer to stop that. When their convoy heads out on patrol of the streets one night, however, one of their humvees is hit with an explosion. Jaeger's leg is horrifically injured. Callahan keeps Jaeger alert until medical staff can take over, then they raid nearby buildings and find a resident. With no interpreter, shouting in opposite languages escalate fast until it results in Callahan pulling the trigger and shooting the man dead. Callahan is aghast.Meanwhile, in Watertown, NY, Oyster has begun his 25 year sentence at Franklin Correctional Facility. Keeping a low profile, he's on cooking duty. Guards notice him sneaking apples into pancakes to add interest, so they invite him into the pantry to gain access to ingredients needed to make apple pies. It is a false pretense. With his back turned, three guards beat him mercilessly to the ground. With their tour of Iraq finished, Snowball, Jaeger and Milk happily return home to a town welcoming them all as heroes. But Callahan is sullen. No family to meet him. Jaeger's fiance' has to drive him home. His brother is unjustly in prison. When he goes to visit him, Oyster doesn't want to see the brother who turned him in. Cal returns with Snowball to act as a mediator, but long burning rage simmers to the surface and escalates into a shouting match that even Snowball can't stop. All the old resentments between the two brothers spill out, including the fact that Cal long ago was made legal guardian of Oyster because there was no one else. Guards pull them apart, but not before Snowball notices bruising on Oyster's chest.Disheartened at the injustice of Oyster's lengthy sentence, Cal and Snowball start probing into legal ways to change things for the better. They petition for Oyster to be moved. They inquire into the abuse. The guards threaten Oyster to keep his mouth shut. Cal asks what if Dwyer were to change his testimony? Callahan uses his authority as a police office to question Dwyer at his home, which turns into a fight and resultant suspension of Callahan. Even Clara, who provides free legal service to veterans, can't seem to make any headway.They visit Jaeger at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in Maryland, where he's lost the lower third of his right leg. With Cal driving, the four head home. Finally together, Jaeger quietly voices his concerns as to Cal's mental state-as well as Oyster's well-being. Neither looks good.Sleepless nights and bouts of rage envelop Callahan. Nothing seems possible. They're horrified by the injustice of it all. Cal reasons that if he were to shoot someone at home like he did in Iraq, he'd be in prison for it. One night, after a visit to the VFW hall, Cal breaks down. Everything seems hopeless. His three friends remind him they need him.Then comes the breakthrough. One evening, Cal tells Snowball, Jaeger and Milk he's going to break Oyster out of prison and get him across the border into Canada. He's not asking for their advice; he's telling them. With a transfer to another facility in a few days, it is Cal's chance to free Oyster. Snowball and Jaeger join in. At first Milk is opposed, but he eventually joins in.As the plan comes together, their military expertise comes in to play. They'll transfer Oyster across the water into Canada at Snowball's place of work, where he's gotten a false ID to help. Clara, suspicious as to Cal's inquiries regarding sentences for jail breakers, visits Jaeger. She quizzes him, and marches into the living room to discover him cleaning his rifle. Over the course of the night, she realizes the need for this illegal activity and sanctions the risk, telling Cal she'll lie about Jaeger's alibi. They still have feelings for each other.They help Oyster escape and he makes it to Canada. Cal gives himself up."

Two young women search for meaning and hope in the struggle to rebuild their lives amongst the ruins. 1945, Leningrad. World War II has devastated the city, demolishing its buildings and leaving its citizens in tatters, physically and mentally. Although the siege - one of the worst in history - is finally over, life and death continue their battle in the wreckage that remains. Two young women, Iya and Masha, search for meaning and hope in the struggle to rebuild their lives amongst the ruins. 26-year-old Kantemir Balagov follows TESNOTA, winner of the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, with a powerful period drama. In the aftermath of the devastating World War II, on the battle-scarred carcass of 1945 Leningrad, the pale and shy young nurse of the city's veterans hospital, Iya, finds herself grappling with increasingly regular fits of post-traumatic stress disorder. As tall as a giraffe, Iya has earned the funny nickname, Beanpole; however, the sudden arrival of her only friend, Masha, a damaged female soldier who has just returned from the front, will soon become the painful reminder that, even though the enemy is gone forever, the war is far from over yet. Now, against the backdrop of post-apocalyptic scenes of destruction and death, two troubled young survivors attempt to start their lives from scratch, bury the nightmarish past, and find solace in friendship. Will the unresolved traumas of peace ever heal?—Nick Riganas The film begins in Leningrad shortly after the conclusion of the Second World War and focuses on two women, Iya Sergueeva, a tall blonde woman nicknamed ""Beanpole"" (Dylda)(played by Viktoria Miroshnichenko) and Masha (played by Vasilisa Perelygina). The film begins with Iya suffering from a PTSD episode in which she involuntarily freezes up while working as a nurse in a hospital under Dr. Nikolay Ivanovich (Andrey Bykov). Iya is caring for her son Pashka in a communal apartment but accidentally smothers him to death when she suffers another episode while playing with him. Shortly afterwards Masha returns from the front and reveals that Pashka was not actually Iya's child, but Masha's. Masha had given birth to Pashka while at war, and had given him to Iya for safekeeping while she was away. Masha asks to see Pashka but correctly guesses that Pashka is dead through Iya's quiet distress.Bitter yet seemingly unfazed, Masha invites Iya out dancing, though they soon find that the dance hall is closed due to the war. Sasha, the young son of a wealthy local official and his friend noticed the girls and introduce themselves, eventually drinking and talking in Sasha's car. Masha orders Iya out of the car to go on a ""walk"" with Sasha's friend so Masha can have sex with Sasha in the back seat. Iya attacks Sasha's friend when he attempts to seduce her, and beats Sasha over the head when she finds him having sex with Masha. The next day, Iya notices Masha's hysterectomy scar and Masha tells her that she wanted to have sex with Sasha, and that she wants to have a child to heal her.Masha soon applies to work at the same hospital as Iya, revealing to doctor Nikolai Ivanovich that she and Iya served together in an anti-aircraft gun crew but Iya was eventually discharged after suffering a traumatic head wound, while Masha continued serving in the army ""to Berlin"". Shortly afterwards, the wife of a paralyzed WW2 soldier, Stepan (played by Konstantin Balakirev) arrives at the hospital to find her husband alive, despite having already told her children that he had been killed in the war. Stepan cannot bear the idea of returning to his children as a quadriplegic and, alongside his wife, begs Nikolai Ivanovich to euthanize him instead. Nikolai Ivanovich is at first extremely opposed to the idea, but eventually relents, asking Iya to do the job and indicating it will be the ""last time"". Iya hesitantly agrees and during one night injects Stepan with a fatal dosage of morphine, smoking a cigarette for him and blowing it into his mouth until he dies. Masha, on night watch and suffering from chronic fatigue due to the war, laid down to rest in a nearby cot shortly beforehand and watches Iya and Stepan.Masha uses this case of illegal euthanasia as blackmail against both Iya and Nikolai Ivanovich, and devises a plan in which Iya will be impregnated by Nikolai Ivanovich, with Masha raising the child as her own, in a warped surrogacy agreement. When Iya initially refuses, Masha reminds her that she is ""owed"" a child from Iya after she let Pashka die in her care. Nikolai Ivanovich, fearing for his career, also agrees, and the two have sex next to Masha in bed. Masha continues to see Sasha afterwards, frustrating Iya, who seems to have feelings for Masha. Iya soon finds out that she is not actually pregnant, and instead just had a late period, but she neglects to tell Masha. While trying on a dress for their seamstress neighbor, Masha begins to twirl repeatedly while suffering a mental breakdown. Iya calms Masha by kissing her. Masha initially fights her off but Iya suffers another paralytic episode, during which Masha kisses her in return. Later, after an argument in which Iya orders Sasha to stop coming to their apartment with food, Sasha invites Masha to meet his parents. Iya, distraught, walks to Nikolai Ivanovich's house and tearfully begs him to sleep with her to successfully impregnate her. Nikolai Ivanovich turns down her advances, but invites her to come with him and leave the city.Masha visits Sasha's parents at their large estate, but receives a cold response by his parents, who seem to judge her for serving in the Red Army, considering her an ""army base wife"". Masha reveals the truth of her time in the war, saying that she did what she had to do to survive, sleeping with soldiers capable of providing for her and protecting her from others. Masha reveals that her abdominal scar was not caused by a combat injury as she first described, but from a number of abortions she had on the front lines. She asserts that she loves Sasha, and will have a child, given to her from Iya. Sasha's mom responds with respect and admiration for Masha's time in the war, and says that she does not dislike Masha, but instead fears she will be treated badly by Sasha, who has known only their wealthy lifestyle and would quickly grow bored and eventually discard her. Sasha, enraged, storms out of the room and Masha rides the tram home alone.On the way home, Masha's tram hits and kills a tall blonde woman on the street. Masha pushes through the crowd but is unable to recognize the woman mangled underneath the tram. Fearing the worst, Masha runs home only to find Iya sitting alone in the apartment. Masha promises Iya that Sasha is gone, and that they will have a good life and raise a healthy child together. The two weep together in an embrace as the film ends."

Paddleton,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8041276/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"An unlikely friendship between two misfit neighbors becomes an unexpectedly emotional journey when the younger man is diagnosed with terminal cancer. The movie opens with Michael (Mark Duplass) & Andy (Ray Romano) in a doctor's office as she gives Michael the news that he has cancer & it has spread to several areas. She recommends he see a specialist to learn more about his prognosis and options. Andy interrupts and tries to get the doctor to give them more information about Michael's prognosis but she avoids doing this. Michael absorbs the news from the doctor without much show of emotion.
The scene jumps to an abandoned drive-in theater where Michael and Andy are pulling a barrel into place to play a game. They use tennis rackets to hit racquetballs off the backside of the screen, trying to get the ball to bounce into a 55-gallon barrel they've positioned nearby. We learn later in the film they made up this game themselves and call it Paddleton. When they finish and are walking home, Andy asks Michael what he learned from the specialist. Michael ignores the question, grabs Andy's hat and runs away. Next we see them together in Andy's apartment, making a pizza then watching a movie called ""Death Punch"". It is obvious they've seen the movie several times as they quote lines in synch with the film and have choreographed punches and blocks as they sit side-by-side on the couch. Next there are several short scenes in quick succession; them going to work, at their jobs (Michael at a copy shop & Andy at an office), playing the game again, Michael on-line at a cancer support website, them working a jig-saw puzzle together as they watch the same movie again. As you watch their scenes together it becomes more and more obvious they really enjoy each other's company and have a very close relationship, sharing lots of inside jokes and ongoing conversations.
As they are leaving another game at the theater, Andy tells Michael that he has been preparing a half-time speech to motivate a losing team that is so good he could probably sell it to a coach someday. Michael asks to hear it but Andy says it's not ready yet. Michael also unsuccessfully tries to guess the partially completed hang-man phrase on his sweatshirt that we later learn was given to him by Andy. Michael tells Andy he's seen 2 oncologists and the gist of it is that he is terminal with less than 6 months to live. He doesn't want to wait til he gets really sick and die in a hospital so he intends to use an assisted-suicide method he's discovered through the support group. He asks Andy to help him because he doesn't want to do it alone. Andy is obviously reluctant and at first tells Michael that he can't just give up. Michael explains that he doesn't want things to change between them just because of his illness, that he really just wants to continue living, doing the things they enjoy doing together until he is no longer able. At this point Andy relents and agrees that he will help. Andy investigates and finds that the closest pharmacy that will fill the prescription is 6 hours away so they decide to take a road trip.
Along the drive they have interesting conversations during which we learn Andy doesn't like small talk and doesn't think he's good at it. They also stop at an ostrich farm for Michael because ""I've never seen one in real life."" At the pharmacy they discover the pharmacist they spoke with before they left is not on duty. Andy wants to leave and come back ""when Phil is here"" but Michael insists they go ahead. The pharmacist, David, tells them Phil left clear instructions and begins to read the instructions for the process. The men want to skip that part since Phil told them about it but David tells them it's required. Next Andy tries to pay for the prescription, telling Michael ""Just let me do this"" even though it's really expensive but then his credit card is denied. After the pharmacy they check into a hotel which once again Andy had intended to pay for but can't since his card isn't working. In the room Andy suggests that he keep the prescription in his upstairs apartment since it is safer from floods and thieves. He then goes back to the pharmacy and purchases a children's toy safe to keep it in. Andy won't tell Michael the combination for the safe. After hanging out in the hotel room for a while they go to a bar where it is a combination of karaoke and open-mic. Andy goes to the bathroom and stares into the mirror while practicing his half-time speech. He comes out clearly prepared to tell it to Michael and maybe everyone but decides against it when he sees David, the pharmacist, has joined Michael at the bar. Andy's actions and comments make it obvious that he doesn't like David's intrusion on their time together. It is at this point that Michael steps up to the mike and starts to tell everyone about ""a very special movie"" that he enjoys very much (""Death Punch"") and describes some of the scenes in the movie that we've seen when they watched earlier. As Michael's description begins to falter Andy comes to his rescue and together they do a good job of portraying the scenes. Later at the hotel they decide to enjoy the hot-tub even though it's after hours. They are joined by the clerk who checked them in earlier who lets them know she thinks that what they have together is wonderful. They ask for clarification and she says its obvious that the two of them have a very special, close relationship. They realize she thinks they are homosexual and they tell her they aren't. As conversation continues it becomes clear the clerk is attracted to Andy so Michael excuses himself to the room. When Andy comes back in he can't tell if Michael is breathing or not so he wakes him. Michael asks how it went with the clerk and Andy says nothing happened.
The next morning Michael is gone along with the safe and Andy panics. He runs around the area trying to find Michael til he winds up back at the hotel to discover him in the lobby relaxing. Andy then grabs the safe and refuses to give it back to Michael. Next we see them driving home, not speaking to one another and Andy riding in the backseat holding the safe. Once they arrive home Andy sets the safe on the stairs and Michael comes out to pick it up. Andy gives Michael a riddle to determine the combination, Michael guesses it and they share a laugh together. Andy tells Michael that if he is acting strangely then it's because he finds it difficult to just be normal during this process. Michael nods in acknowledgement. Next there are several scenes where we see them back in their routines, spending time together but also showing Michael getting weaker and sicker. At a birthday celebration for Andy with just the two of them in Michael's apartment, Andy blows out his cupcake candle then asks Michael ""You still got cancer."" Michael laughs and says yeah and Andy says ""That never works"", ostensibly referring to his birthday wish.
Some time later as they are hanging out together Michael says he's ready to take the prescription. As they prepare the concoction Andy offers to tell Michael his half-time speech. Michael tells him he's already heard it, many times, through the vent as Andy practiced it upstairs. They laugh about this. Andy then tells Michael that when Michael was applying for the apartment, Andy thought he looked like weird, ""like you might be one of those guys with a lot of hands and feet in your freezer"" and he tried to talk the manager into not renting to him. He says this was before he knew Michael was such a cool guy. Michael then asks about his hang-man shirt and Andy tells him that the shirt doesn't actually have an answer. When Michael asks why he would do that Andy says it's because he's noticed that when they did jigsaw puzzles together, they enjoyed the hard work and the process of completing it and even though they were happy at the end to have completed it, Michael always seemed ""just a little sad"" that it was over. Andy thought he would give Michael a puzzle that he could think about and work on, enjoying the process but never having that moment of sadness since he could never get it. Andy hoped that this would make it Michael's favorite shirt. Michael then takes the anti-nausea pill to keep him from throwing up after he takes the lethal prescription. While they wait an hour for it to completely kick in, they have their final conversations. Michael tells Andy he can have his car and his phone. Andy says he'll take the car but doesn't want his phone, he wants a better phone. Michael asks why he wants a better phone since he probably won't know how to use it anyway. Michael then asks Andy if he wants to arrange a signal that Andy would recognize as being from Michael just in case there is an afterlife. They banter back and forth about what would be a good sign, never settling on one, when Andy's timer goes off for the elapsed hour.
Back in Michael's apartment, Michael considers different options on where he wants to be at the end before finally deciding on the bedroom. Andy goes to the kitchen to mix the drink (the lethal prescription powder mixed with water) and brings it to him. Michael pauses briefly and sets the glass down like he might be reconsidering before picking up the glass and swallowing it all quickly. Michael wants to lay down so they both stretch out together side-by-side on Michael's bed. Michael quickly starts to become very anxious, shaking and crying, telling Andy he's scared. Andy sits up and begins doing his best to calm Michael, telling him that it will be all right, everything is going to be OK. Michael asks to hold Andy's hand, tells him he's going a good job and tells him that he loves him. Andy places his other hand comfortingly on Michael's head as Michael breathes deeply to try and maintain control. Both are crying. Michael tells Andy he's going to close his eyes. Very soon Michael's breathing becomes shallow. Michael has stopped shaking and Andy tells him ""I love you too"" just as Michael seems to have one final exhale.
Next we see Andy as he continues life without his best friend, doing things like watching ""Death Punch"", playing Paddleton alone. In the final scene we see a mother and young son moving into Michael's apartment. Andy helps her carry an armload of stuff to her door and tries to strike up a conversation with her son, offering to teach him Paddleton sometime (""It doesn't sound like a lotta fun, but it is"".)"

After a favorable surgery, and doctor's opinion that the cancer was completely removed, nevertheless and despite the husband's protest, who in need for additional therapy sees contradiction with the success attributed to surgery, chemotherapy is still necessary to eliminate individual malignant cells, possibly spread throughout the body, which could cause relapse of the illness. The film has an open ending, but there is no reason for pessimism: the surgery was successful, the recommended chemotherapy, though truly almost never without extraordinary efforts for the patient, was carried out effectively.

That's too bad though, cause news travels fast in small-town Alabama. The film begins with friends Dick Long, Zeke Olsen, and Earl Wyeth carousing: playing loud rock music, shooting off fireworks, and pulling pranks on one another. The night turns deadly serious when Dick ends up sustaining severe injuries and his friends dump him in front of an emergency room. The cause of his wounds is unexplained.Earl returns to his home and loads up his truck with several of his possessions, telling friend and casual love interest Lake that he has to leave town for a family emergency but rather than skip town immediately, he briefly attends a shift at his warehouse job.Zeke gets a shower and quietly sneaks into bed, fooling his wife Lydia into thinking he had been asleep. She asks him to drive their daughter Cynthia to school. He agrees and when Lydia asks him for some cash, he inadvertently pulls Dick's wallet out of his pocket: he and Zeke took it off of him as he laid unconscious. He takes out the driver's license and puts it on the counter and quickly gets Cynthia down to the garage. Before they leave, he realizes that his back seat is covered in blood and he covers it with a sheet.As the two men begin their day, Dr. Richter-the physician who discovered Dick lying outside the hospital where he works-calls the local police department. The man has died overnight from severe rectal hemorrhaging and he suspects that there was a sex crime involved.Zeke stops off at a gas station and inside the store, Cynthia interacts with Officer Dudley. As the child tells her that her father found a wallet that he should return, Zeke notices that the blood in the back seat has soaked through to Cynthia's dress.

Zeke confesses that he, Earl and Dick all had participated in zoophilic acts for years, and Dick died from having had sex with Dick and Jane's horse Comet. Lydia is disgusted and demands that he leave.He goes to a local bar to meet Earl and becomes resolved that he will not run away. Meanwhile, at the police station, Dudley and Spenser agree to return to the Olsens' and to inform Jane of what has happened to her husband.At Jane's house, she walks to their stable to find a drunk Zeke shirtless. She asks him what is happening and if Dick is having an affair. He reassures her that he is not and the duo walk back to Zeke's house where Dudley has recently arrived.

Dudley is incredulous but her boss explains that these charges would only cause more harm, ruining the lives of Cynthia, Jane, and Lydia. Zeke wanders away from the police station to Cynthia's school in time to catch the end of her piano recital. Lydia briefly confronts him and tells him to get out of their lives.That night, he is dropped off at a motel where Earl and Lake have a room.

Makkhi appears to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle most of the times.One fateful day, a despaired girl, probably injured, arrives in a hurry at Makkhi's station after escaping from somewhere, and seeks help; Makkhi, expecting to punish her captors, who tried to sell her and other girls off, is joined by Chulbul, and after a scuffle, the brothers arrest Chinti Walia (Dolly Bindra), who runs a prostitution racket.
While trying to force a confession out of Chinti at the police station, Chulbul intercepts a lawyer and some goons who have come over to have Chinti released, but he tears off the court order, and in desperation, the leader of the goons keeps his video call going on even as Chulbul smiles into the screen. Minutes later, the leader shows the video call to Bali Singh (Sudeep), who sees Chulbul, who in turns looks back into the phone camera to see Bali. Shocked beyond words, he reminisces his younger days, recalling his fate with Bali.Years ago, when he was still young, Chulbul, whose real name turns out to be Dhaakad Chand Pandey, fell in love with a girl, Khushi (Saiee Manjrekar), who was initially being considered as a potential bride for Makkhi, after he noticed a photo of her in Makkhi's hand, and told his mother, Naini Devi (Dimple Kapadia), that he would be a good fit instead of Makkhi; a few days later, Khushi's maternal uncle Prabhat and maternal aunt Janki (Medha Manjrekar) agreed to the match between Dhaakad and Khushi, and the two began courting each other. At the same time, Bali, a ruthless and violent goon, set his eyes on Khushi and began making arrangements for his marriage with her. However, the moment he saw Dhaakad with Khushi, he decided to kill Khushi and her family right in front of Dhaakad's eyes after luring him to the spot.

Meanwhile, an ill-attracted Makkhi is misled by Bali into turning against Chulbul, nearly so as to slap him after he too is promoted to the rank of ASP. The action causes him to be banished from home by Prajapati, and he joins hands with Bali actively.
Bali, who is set to become a politician and a minister in the upcoming elections, plans to bring in a truck filled with lots of money, and thus gets Makkhi and many other policemen in his circle transferred to one common location in order to facilitate the transportation. Chulbul, however, intercepts the truck and turns Bali's moles in the police force against Bali himself. As revenge, Bali gets several of Chulbul's associates kidnapped and brutally beaten to near death, until Chulbul breaks in again and frees them all, even when Bali has run away with Makkhi and some reliable accomplices.Seeking to lure Bali into counter productive action, Chulbul kidnaps Minister S.

Bali notices the same and Makkhi helps him track them down since he recognizes the hideout.

A trio of teenage miscreants are given one last chance to turn their lives around by completing the Duke of Edinburgh Award trek across the highlands. Along for ride is one little overachiever who is in this for the opportunity to pad his CV. They don't have anything in common, but the ragtag quartet are dropped in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a map and they have to work together to reach their campsite before dark. However, they aren't as alone as they think, and soon they are being stalked by wealthy aristocrats who intend to hunt and kill them for sport, and they only have their wits to protect them. Three problem students (Dean, Duncan, and DJ Beatroot) are taken to the Scottish Highlands by teacher Mr. Carlyle to try to achieve the Duke of Edinburgh Award, which requires participants to navigate the Highlands as a team relying only on a paper map. The three are joined by the bookish student Ian, who wants to receive the award to improve his college application.Carlyle drives off in the minibus, instructing the boys to meet him at a designated campsite. The boys reluctantly set out, but spirits rise when Dean reveals he has hash. Unbeknownst to them, a man watches through a rifle scope as the boys get high.The boys encounter a farmer plowing his field. After getting directions from him, DJ Beatroot gives the farmer his mix CD. Sometime later the boys spot a man in upper class hunting gear and ask him for help, but as he nears they see he is wearing a mask and he begins firing at them. Fleeing, the stoned boys decide he must be the ""Duke of Edinburgh.""

Believing that he is the Duke and that he will kill them, Duncan sneaks to the minibus and runs Carlyle over. The other boys freak out, but they ultimately decide to make Carlyle's apparent death look like an accident by having the minibus drive off a cliff. However, after they put Carlyle's body in the vehicle, it starts rolling back down a long hill. Duncan says it will most likely fall off a cliff anyway and the boys continue on.Meanwhile, the local police, Sergeant Morag and PC Hamish, interrupt their search for a notorious bread thief after Morag receives an erroneous report that Duncan is a terrorist and is loose in the area.

The boys realize to their dismay that Mr. Carlyle was not the Duke after all. As they flee, Ian falls into a ditch and is separated from the others. DJ Beatroot then argues with Dean and Duncan and sets off for a barn in the distance while the other two head to a cave to ingest a load of powdered soup.Inside the barn DJ Beatroot is shocked to find a large group of farmers who are big fans-the farmer he encountered earlier has been sharing his mixtape CD. He stays to party with them and holds an impromptu concert. Elsewhere, the Duke and Duchess capture Ian; Dean and Duncan, covered in powdered soup, hear his cries and rush off to help. Just as it looks like all is lost DJ Beatroot and the farmers appear and chase off the Duke and Duchess after stealing their weapons.The next morning boys decide to hunt down the Duke and Duchess. They finally corner the pair on a shoreline. The villains, held at weapon-point, explain that modern youths must be culled because they are too bratty and ungrateful. Dean retorts that adults have wrecked the world and left young people to clean up the mess. Suddenly, more well-dressed, masked hunters join the Duke and Duchess, holding the boys at gunpoint. They prepare to execute the boys, when the minibus rolls off a cliff onto the hunters, crushing them all to death. The relieved boys look inside the minibus and are overjoyed to see that Mr. Carlyle is in fact still alive, if only barely. After makeshift medical treatment, the severely injured Carlyle springs up and says that the boys are in big trouble for trying to kill him. The police, Morag and Hamish, appear. As Carlyle tries to tell Morag about the boys running him over, Hamish discovers a huge stash of stolen bread in the back of the minibus-it turns out that Carlyle was the notorious bread thief. The boys cover for him by telling Morag that the van belonged to the crushed hunters. In gratitude Carlyle agrees to give the boys the Duke of Edinburgh Award and they are celebrated as heroes.

The Cave,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8726180/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A Thai youth football team is trapped in a cave while rescue workers scramble to save them. When a youth football team of 12 boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach is trapped deep inside a cave in Northern Thailand, thousands of volunteers and soldiers from around the world unite in a race against time to find them. Once the boys are found alive ten days later, the only way out is an impossible five-hour dive-swim that only expert cave divers could survive. In Ireland, airplane factory electrician and recreational cave diverJim Warnygets the call: ""How soon can you be here?"" Arriving in Thailand, Jim steps off the plane and into the cave - a knife-edge three-day mission is underway. Based on true events, THE CAVE tells the thrilling story of the largest international rescue mission of modern times, from the unique perspective of the men and women facing life-and-death decisions and displaying selfless determination and sacrifice, culminating in a triumphant outcome against all the odds. In the summer of 2018, the world was transfixed by the plight of a Thai boys' football team trapped in a flooded cave for over two weeks. Against all odds, the boys were rescued in a daring and difficult mission thanks to an international coalition of divers and experts. It's a story made for the movies, and Thai-Irish directorTom Waller(The Last Executioner (2014)) adds an extra dose of realism to the nail-biting tension: four divers recruited for the mission play themselves in this stirring account of a human miracle. Focusing on the rescue efforts, the film uses a journalistic style in taking us to the chaotic, multilingual base camp and into the dark waters of the cave with the divers. Waller lays out the daunting logistics and risks of the rescue mission with clarity and urgency as they unfold against a background of local Thai culture and spirituality. This unsentimental yet moving tribute to the heroism and humanity of those, from all walks of life, who cared and sacrificed for the boys encapsulates why the story captured people's imagination in the first place.—Vancouver International Film Festival People power and authenticity drive this dramatic study of the July 2018 rescue of the Wild Boars football team, trapped in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The situation had all the elements of a movie - a daring mission, impossible odds, and, most importantly, a happy ending. It's this last detail that would seemingly hamper any film adaptation - how do you tell a story where everyone knows how it ends? The solution is simple. Without compromising the inherent tension, Thai/Irish directorTom Wallerfocuses on the human element, showcasing a wide range of the thousands of people involved in the rescue. Several key participants portray themselves in this retelling, adding to its verisimilitude. With Hollywood versions inbound, it's appropriate that a Thai adaptation came first. This impressive film is likely to be the definitive realisation.—Byron Bay Film Festival"

Section 375,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8144834/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A celebrated Bollywood director Rohan Khurana stands accused by a female member of his crew, Anjali Dangle of having raped her at his residence. Notable film director Rohan Khurana is arrested and convicted by a sessions court after assistant costume designer Anjali Dangle accuses him of rape. In the High Court, senior and talented criminal barrister Tarun Saluja works hard to punch holes in the accuser's claims, while Hiral Gandhi a fervent lawyer fighting her first big case, who was once Saluja's trainee, serve as the prosecutor and defence barrister of the claimed victim. Tarun Saluja goes by his principle Law is a fact, Justice is abstract. & lawyer should not get emotionally involved in the case or get into the debate of what is right or wrong. Tarun Saluja explains Hiral Gandhi that how justice is left out without proper defence. The pursuit of justice is nothing but a career opportunity for the defence lawyer, prosecution & the judges as well. He summaries this with his line "" We're in the business of law, not of Justice"". This is completely contrary to Hiral's attitude who gets passionately involved in her pursuit to deliver justice. For this very reason, she has quit the law firm of Tarun.Tarun in his cross-examination exposes tampering of evidence, lies & facts hidden by key witnesses. It is later clear that Anjali had consensual relation with Rohan which started with the pressure of retaining her job, but with time she got emotionally involved in the relationship. Later when she realises that Rohan is only interested in keeping a physical relationship with her whereas she was expecting him to be her life partner. There is a big argument between the two on this issue. Rohan belittles her & tells her that without him her career is over. Later Rohan throws her out of his second flat where they pursued their relationship. After a couple of days, Anjali apologises to Rohan & they rekindle their relationship. Later in the day, she reports this incident as rape to police.Insisting that it is a case of an affair gone sour, Tarun Saluja points out that the law does not regard consensual physical relations as rape. Hiral Gandhi argues that though a couple may have had a consensual relationship in the past, any subsequent sexual encounter without consent of the girl is rape. The case disputes the legal provisions of the penal code 375 that defines conditions under which a sexual offence can be defined as rape.The judges are put in a tough spot because on one hand, it is clear that Anjali had filed this case to take avenge her humiliation & on the other hand there is a strong public perception that rich & influential people are exploiting the underprivileged people. The two judges deliberate on the case in their chamber. A judgement in favour of Tarun would badly reflect on their credentials however, circumstantial evidence clearly points to fake rape charges. One of the judges peeks from the balcony and see protests against the accused going out of control and it is clear what their judgement would be. The bench while delivering the verdict accepts the merit of the case presented by Tarun however, they give into the public sentiment & strictly go by the book. They uphold the session court judgement which states that since there is no evidence of consent or force for this particular incident, so the statement of the victim is considered as paramount evidence. Later she is invited for dinner by Tarun's family & there he reminds her ""We're in the business of law, not of Justice"" which she now truly understands."

She investigates. It's been a year since her older sister's murder, and Echo is still far from being completely all right. Echo has been trying her hardest to be the strong one, while her mother takes too many antidepressants and her father works too much. Now, at the start of her freshman year of high school, Echo receives an unlikely gift from Zoe's old boyfriend: her diary. Echo is hesitant to read it but can't put it down after she gets caught up in Zoe's secret life. Echo, a high school freshman, is attempting to come to terms with the loss of her older sister, Zoë, who was murdered a year ago. On Echo's first day of school, many students gawk at her or make comments as she walks by, while a few, including her crush Parker, approach her to offer their condolences. Echo's mother has been abusing antidepressants while her father works overtime. They regularly visit a family therapist, though Echo finds the sessions to be largely unhelpful.One day, while sitting with her best friend Abby at lunch, Echo sees Zoë's boyfriend, Marc. Abby tells Echo that Marc had spent some time in a psychiatric hospital in the wake of Zoë's death. Marc was a prime suspect in Zoë's murder, and though the actual killer, an internet predator had confessed and was convicted, Echo still suspects Marc was involved. One day, while walking home, Echo comes across Marc's new car, and sees Zoë's diary in the passenger seat. She shatters the window with a nearby rock to retrieve the diary, and brings it home with her.Once Echo begins reading, she learns that Zoë and Marc had met at a pool party over the summer. Marc's a recovering addict and doesn't indulge in drugs or alcohol. They began a relationship, and Zoë confessed to Marc her plans to move to Los Angeles or New York after graduation and begin a modeling career. Marc shares a secret of his own - his ex-girlfriend had gone to rehab in Colorado after breaking up with him, and her parents got a restraining order against him. Marc insists that he has changed and that his past mistakes shouldn't define him, though Echo remains suspicious of him.Echo and Abby go to a house party hosted by Abby's crush, Chess. The party is awkward and underwhelming, but Echo escapes outside with Parker. They make small talk, and the subject of Zoë eventually surfaces. Parker apologizes, but Echo insists she isn't offended. Parker assures Echo that the reason people act strange around her is out of fear of causing her more pain than she has already been subjected to. Echo kisses him before they go back inside.Echo attends her first school dance, leading to an encounter with Carley, Zoë's best friend, who persuades Echo to drink and take ecstasy with her. During her drug trip, Echo rushes to the bathroom, where she sees an apparition of Zoë, who urges her to stop pretending. Later, Carley runs into Echo and, mistaking her for Zoë in her high state, apologizes to her profusely, mentioning something about an unnamed male and a video. This encounter distresses Echo, who's found and comforted by Marc. Another flashback sequence shows Marc being interviewed by the police in front of Echo and her parents. It's revealed that Zoë's body was found in Marc's car, which he said she borrowed and didn't tell him why. Marc, feeling guilty for his unintentional part in Zoë's death, later attempted suicide via gunshot to the head, only to be stopped by his mother.Echo continues reading Zoë's diary. Another flashback reveals Zoë and Carley taking photographs of each other in bikinis to help build their modeling portfolios. Carley invited Zoë to hang out with a 24-year-old named Jason and his friend Tom, and she finally gave in after several attempts to decline. She tried to leave, but the others convinced her to stay for just one drink. Zoë returned home visibly traumatized, and fell asleep in Echo's bed, ominously writing in her diary that Something happened that night. The next morning, she showed Echo a photo of Jason, and gravely made her promise to avoid him if she ever saw him.Back in the present, Echo calls Carley, who invites her to a party at her friend Theresa's house. Echo arrives dressed in Zoë's clothes, where she meets Jason, and instantly recognizes him from the photo and diary entries. Carley is visibly uncomfortable at Jason's presence,while Marc suddenly appears and drags Echo out of the party, urging that he's taking her home. Echo argues with him, claiming that the only reason she's at the party is to uncover the truth about what happened to Zoë. Marc drops Echo at home, only for her to sneak back out and go to The Hunt, a nightclub Carley and Jason had mentioned earlier. This is interspersed with a flashback scene of Zoë at the same club. Zoë found Jason in the back party room, agreeing to make a deal with him. A distressed Zoë fled soon after, interspersed with a scene of Echo doing the same after noticing Jason. Echo then begins wearing Zoë's clothes to school, immediately drawing attention from the other students.The next entry in Zoë's diary details a fight between her and Carley. The exact details of what happened at Jason's are unknown, but Zoë was upset about having been forced to do something she didn't want to, although Carley retained that it was all completely voluntary. Zoë was also convinced that whatever happened at Jason's would come back to haunt them, though Carley insisted nobody would find out. The following entry states that Zoë had bought Echo her own diary as a birthday gift and hid it in her sock box in her closet. Echo goes to retrieve the diary, opens the still wrapped gift and upon reading Zoë's message, breaks down in tears. Echo finally snaps at her next family therapy session, calling out her parents for their unhealthy coping mechanisms and angrily asserting that they all should have been more aware of Zoë's private life.Echo then goes to meet Marc at his and Zoë's usual meeting spot, where Marc confides that he didn't know about Jason until he read Zoë's diary. Echo tells him about her encounter with Carley at the dance, and tells him of her plans to break into Jason's house to retrieve the video that Carley had mentioned, using Marc as a diversion. After school the next day, Echo goes to Jason's house with Carley, though Carley seems apprehensive about letting her do so. Parker insists on going with Marc once he realizes that Echo may be in trouble. Marc crashes his car into Jason's, which leads to a violent confrontation between the two, allowing Jason and Tom to be distracted long enough for Echo to sneak into the basement. There she finds a laptop containing 9 video files of Jason and Tom brutally raping several underage girls, the last of them being Zoë - Carley had sex with Zoë in the video as well; it's revealed that she has been assisting the men in drugging and raping these girls in exchange for drugs. Echo is caught by Carley, who confesses that Jason and Tom film the videos for their private website, which distributes Child Porn, and that Zoë's murderer was a subscriber. Jason blackmailed Zoë, promising that he would delete the video if Zoë met with his alleged photographer friend for a private photo shoot, leading to her murder.Tom and Jason barge into the basement - Tom knocks out Carley and ties Echo to the bed. They conspire to leave the state, and Tom suggests to Jason that he take the girls to a place he knows and kill them so that they don't report the two men to the police. After much hesitance, Jason agrees, but as he begins packing his car, an injured Marc stands up and knocks him unconscious. Parker makes his way into the basement just as Echo frees herself, and he calls the police. Tom enters the basement, but Echo knocks him out before he can attack them. The two men are subsequently arrested for production of child porn, sex trafficking, rape, drug dealing and accessory to murder while their site is shut down.A final flashback scene shows Zoë asking Marc if she can borrow his car, though not explaining why she needed it - she had been going to meet the supposed photographer. Marc confiscated her diary as a collateral, joking that, ironically enough, if she didn't come back, he would read it. Upon finishing the last entry in Zoë's diary, Echo, now having closure, says a final goodbye to her sister, apologizing for not knowing her well enough. Sitting at a bench at Zoë's favorite spot that has been built in her honor, Echo begins writing her first entry in the diary Zoë gifted her."

The Endless Trench,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7937168/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"1936. A country taken by the fascism. A husband marked for the killing. A wife determined to all for saving him. An endless incarceration in his own home. The film starts in 1936. In a small and remote inland town of Andalusia (southern Spain), Higinio is a tailor and a town councilor who has recently got married to Rosa. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Higinio hides in his own house awaiting the right moment to escape with his wife. But he is caught in his attempt by his neighbor, Gonzalo, who blames Higinio for his brother's death and is looking for revenge. Captured by Franco's soldiers, Higinio is driven by truck, along with other opposition prisoners, to a nearby prison. But an unwitting distraction from one of the prisoners gives him a chance to escape. He runs across the town to his house where he is to remain hidden in a secret hole. In the meantime, Gonzalo pays Higinio's wife occasional visits in the belief that she knows his whereabouts. When the civil war comes to an end in 1939, Higinio learns from Rosa that there is a reward for capturing him as well as other insurgents. After one of her father-in-law's visit, Rosa and Higinio's father succeed in moving Higinio into the father's house. But, to their surprise, Higinio's father dies of natural causes and Rosa inherits and moves into her father-in-law's house with Higinio as the secret occupant. Rosa takes charge of her late father-in-law's sewing shop. But, with time, troubles increase: Rosa is raped by Rodrigo, a young Civil Guard and one of her regular customers. Higinio kills him and buries the body in Higinio's hiding place. A few months later Rosa tells Higinio that she's pregnant. Despite Higinio's opposition, and unsure of the paternity of the child, Rosa abandons Higinio for a few months to visit her sister in order to hide her pregnancy to the rest of the town. Alone in the house, Higinio surprises the local postman with his male lover after they break into his theoretically empty house which they intend to use as their love nest. The two of them befriend Higinio, and they promise to keep their mutual secrets. When, in 1945, World War II ends, Higinio's hopes for Allied forces defeating Franco's regime and freeing the country gradually vanish. He continues his seclusion for years to come, living with daily fear and paranoia. Jaime, Rosa's and (presumably) Higinio's son, is taught to say that he is Rosa's nephew and that his parents died when he was a baby. With the house turned into a big cell, Higinio and Rosa's relationship deteriorates due to decades of isolation, guilt and shame. In 1963, Jaime, having grown up up as an idealistic young man and, tired of a life of fear and terror, welcomes a friend home. The friend is wanted by Franco's police forces and Jaime introduces him to his father, who learns that there are many others like him in hiding. At the same time, Jaime confronts his parents about the life he has had and a determined Gonzalo keeps visiting Rosa's sewing shop, still tormented by his brother death, and obsessed with the idea of seeking revenge and kill Higinio at any cost. But then, in 1969, Higinio's life changes after he hears a special news on the radio.—Chockys"

However, the fate of the chosen one will pass from killing his own brother. Romulus and Remus are 18-year-old shepherds brothers living in peace near the Tiber river. Convinced that he is bigger than gods' will, Remus believes that he is meant to become king of the city he will found together with his brother. But their tragic destiny is already written. This incredible journey will lead the two brothers to creating one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen.—X When the river Tiber floods, twin brothers Romulus and Remus are swept away by the water along with their livestock.

The difficulties that Romulus and his mates have to face to keep their enemies at bay are endless, but Romulus never desists from his intention to cross the Tiber river and lay the foundation of a new city. To bring the gods' protection unto him, he steals the sacred fire of Alba together with vestal virgin Satnei. This act unleashes not only Alba's wrath, but also convinces some of Romulus's men that his sacrilege will cause misfortune. After Romulus is wounded in a night assault, Remus has to take care of his brother. Eventually he becomes the leader of the rebel group.

But the Princess Satnei protects ROmulus by cursing anyone who plots to kill him, thereby scaring them enough to behave well. Meanwhile Remus is able to hunt and bring food, thereby strengthening his position in the tribe. Remus tells Romulus about his vision to create a shelter by the side of the Tiber river, so they are not ravaged by nature at night.The group face and defeat a warrior clan and Remus is appointed king by the surviving old men and women of their Pagus. During a sacrifice, Satnei predicts that one of the two brothers will become a great king and build an empire larger than what can be imagined, but to do so he will have to kill the other brother. The tribe assume that the prophecy means that Romulus will end up dead for the sake of his brother's greatness.Remus refuses to accept a divine order that requires him to kill his brother. He extinguishes the sacred fire of Vesta, kills an old priest and leaves Satnei helpless in the middle of a forest. Returning to the Pagus, Remus degrades all the inhabitants into slaves. Romulus regains his health and confronts Remus about his actions. Remus starts displaying his ruthless streak by burning the entire village, until challenged by ROmulus for his actions. Remus, regretful, goes to find Satnei, who while dying from having been attacked by wild animals tells him that sparing Romulus now means that it is Remus who will end up dead at the hands of Romulus.Romulus is able to rekindle the sacred fire and becomes the new leader of the Pagus. He appoints a young woman to watch over the fire so it remains lit, thereby establishing the first Vestal.

Remus then claims the tribe for himself, and threatening to extinguish the sacred flame is confronted by his brother. Remus induces his brother to kill him so that the prophecy can be fulfilled.

First Love,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10228168/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"A young boxer and a call girl get caught up in a drug-smuggling scheme over the course of one night in Tokyo. Leo is a young boxer, successful but unable to show emotion. He has a fight scheduled and is sure that he will win. Instead, his opponent knocks him out. This triggers a chain of unpleasant events involving drugs, corrupt cops, the Yakuza, a female assassin - and Monica, an escort that he must rescue. It's one hell of a night for Leo.—aghaemi Never mind a New York minute: it's in a Shinjuku second that one risks losing one's head in First Love, and when Midnight Madness institution Takashi Miike is winding the clock, you can trust we mean that literally. The latest from the prolific provocateur gets rolling with all that's north of a Yakuza's neck tumbling into the neon-drenched streets of Tokyo - an indelible image that assures us that, despite the film's starry-eyed title, this is romance in the key of Miike. When the schemes of duplicitous punk Kase (Shota Sometani) go comically awry, doomed boxer Leo (Masataka Kubota) and haunted drug addict Monica (Sakurako Konishi) find themselves inadvertently caught in the cross-hairs of two warring gangs. Over the course of an increasingly ridiculous night, a soulful meet-cute between the two innocents transpires - one injected with that signature brand of poetic pandemonium that Midnighters have grown to revere over the course of Miike's now 104 directing credits. That this infectious pastiche coheres as well as it does is a testament to the grounded foundation laid by frequent Miike collaborator Masaru Nakamura (Dead Or Alive 2: Birds, Sukiyaki Western Django), whose script wittily weaves its hyperbolic characters towards a thoughtful expression of the concept of Hatsukoi (first love). Capturing the yearning that blooms with one's first brush with romantic feeling, Miike and Nakamura cut to the heart of it and distill it down to that instant when a person resolves to live for another besides themselves - be it with fists raised, or swords drawn.—Toronto International Film Festival"

Gundala,2019,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8237172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl#synopsis,"Indonesia's preeminent comic book superhero and his alter ego Sancaka enter the cinematic universe to battle the wicked Pengkor and his diabolical squad of orphan assassins. Sancaka has lived on the streets since his parents left him. Living a hard life, Sancaka survives by thinking about his own safety. When the condition of the city gets worse and injustice rages throughout the country, Sancaka must decide whether he continues to live to look after himself or rise to become hero for the oppressed. The film that explores the origins of Gundala, Indonesia's preeminent superhero, unfolds on screen in writer-director Joko Anwar's latest film. A giant-size cinematic universe of comic-book characters whose astonishing exploits and uncanny abilities have for the past 50 years revealed even those of ""Earth's mightiest heroes,"" is ushered in with magnificent scope and exhilarating action. Preserving the core premise of Harya ""Hasmi"" Suraminta's popular series Gundala Putra Petir, Anwar shrewdly re-conceives the source material to more relevantly reflect the country's current sociopolitical milieu and uniquely soaks the ascension of this storm-fueled warrior in a dread-filled atmosphere that recalls the director's frequent forays into horror. Originally a riff on the brilliant scientist-turned-avenger archetype, Gundala's alter-ego Sancaka (Abimana Aryasatya) is now recast as the orphaned son of defiant labor unionists. Hardened by street brawls and disillusioned by years of civic unrest, he lives a life of guarded seclusion until a few fortuitous lightning strikes literally instill in him the supernatural power to finally make a difference. Per comic-book tradition, a hero is only as good as his villain, so enter the nefarious Pengkor: a Luthorian (as in Lex) intellect whose tragic past has left him disfigured, vindictive, and in secret command of thousands of orphan assassins(!). Now that he's architect to a rogues' gallery of eccentric fiends - a crackerjack ensemble that includes the film's fight choreographer Cecep Arif Rahman (The Raid 2, John Wick 3) - it isn't long before Pengkor's dastardly designs lure Sancaka into his orbit and a cavalcade of electrifying fisticuffs erupt.—Toronto International Film Festival"

During the battle that was fought in the region that today lies in the northern part of Pakistan and Afghanistan, 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikhs of the British Indian Army held off 6,000-10,000.Maharaja Ranjit Singh had built the Sikh empire in in North and North West India. His empire borders with Afganistan. He had built many forts along the Afghan border for the safety of the kingdom. The Sikh forces kept the Afgans at check. The British when took over India they deployed Sikh Troops in the Afgan borders as Sikhs are the only force capable of defeating the Afgans.
Havaldar Ishar Singh (Akshay Kumar) is part of a Sikh Troop part of British Indian Army posted at Gulistan fort along the Indian Afgan border. His immediate superior British officer is jealous of him because of Ishar Singh's superior fighting skills. The British officer thinks low about the native Indians thinking them cowards. While just returning back from a border patrol, the troop sees a group of Afgan tribesmen are trying to kill a married woman. The woman was forcefully married and she is not acknowledging her marriage. She wanted to run away from her husband's household and got caught in that process. The tribesmen led by a Mullah is about to kill the lady in the Afgan Territory where as the Sikh troop was watching this just across the Indian border. Ishar Singh saves the lady by killing the lady's husband thereby disobeying his immediate superior British officer.Once the troop reaches the base fort, the British officer reports Ishar Singh's disobedience to his Commanding Officer who sits at near by Lackhort fort. The Commanding Officer was on his way to Gulistan fort. The Afgans attack Gulistan fort and Ishar Singh fought valiantly killing many Afghans. The joint attack by the troops available in Gulistan fort and the troops of the Commanding Officer (who was on his way to Gulistan fort) made the Afghans flee.
Ishar Singh got a punishment transfer to Saragarhi Fort. Saragarhi fort sits between Gulistan and Lackhort fort and enables communication between them. When Ishar Singh's transfer orders were issued his officer humiliated him telling the Indians are cowards and they are slaves to the British. Ishar Singh moves towards Saragarhi fort. The woman he had rescued earlier gives him some sweet as a sense of gratitude. Ishar Singh fondly remembers his wife on his way to Saragarhi.
When Ishar Singh reached at Sargarhi Fort to take charge he found the troop to be in mess and loose. He enforced discipline in the troop and strengthened them. The troop respected Ishar Singh. The troop has Gurmukh Singh (Sumeet Singh Basra) who knew English. Naik Lal Singh (Suvinder Vicky) was Ishar Singh's second in command. Khuda Dad is a Pathan who works as the fort cook and orderly. Meanwhile the Mullah who was trying to mob lynch the woman formed an alliance among the Afghan tribes and motivates them to attack on the Indian Territories as an unified force.Meanwhile Ishar Singh and Lal Singh went to a near by village in search of their informer. They came to know that all young-men from the village had enlisted for war. The village is left with kids, women and old men. The villagers are struggling to repair the village mosque. Ishar Singh motivated his men to help the villagers build the mosque. The Sikhs were initially reluctant. But then they realized that one Gurdwara was build by a Muslim Fakir. That information changed their heart. Ishar Singh and his men helped the villagers with it and won the heart of the villagers. One Sikh Sepoy (who is untouchable by Indian Sciety) was touched by the fact that one Afghan village lady had gave him one almond and shown her love.
The British Commanding Officer from Lockhart fort saw the Afgan Forces marching towards Sargarhi Fort. He alerted the Sargarhi Fort by some cipher code. Ishar Singh and his men received the message and saw thousands of tribesmen encircling Sargarhi Fort. They have also alerted the Gulistan Fort. The tribesmen were around ten thousand. They cut all routes of re-enforcement to Sargarhi Fort. The Mullah killed the woman whom Ishar Singh had rescued earlier in-front of the Sargarhi Fort. The Commanding Officer sent a message to the Sikh Troops to abandon the fort and flee. The Sikhs laughed listening the order of fleeing. One of the lance Naik Chanda Singh (Vansh Bharadwaj) doubted the leadership capabilities of Ishar Singh. Ishar Singh put one saffron turban and motivated the force to fight the Afgans in the name of Pride, Religion and country, not just because they are employed as Sepoy in the British Indian Army.The Afgans were playing their drums. Ishar Singh started playing his own drum. The Afghans got demotivated and stopped playing their own. Ishar Singh than aimed at the mullah. One Afgan leader assured the Mullah that the gun is out of range and it would not reach the distance where the Afgans are standing. When Ishar Singh fired it hit one of the Afghan soldier and he died. The Sikhs got astonished as the the bullet was not supposed cover the distance. Ishar Singh explained that the air is moving from their side to the Afgans. So due to the air flow the gun was bale to hit the tribesman.
Ishar Singh deployed his force in position. Gurmukh Singh asked that actually the Commanding Officer has ordered them to fight. But why Ishar Singh told that the order was to flee. Ishar Singh told that the British considered the Indians as slaves. But the Sikhs knowing that the order was to flee, denied the order and choose to fight till death against a numerically far superior enemy by their own free will. By doing so the Sikhs had chosen their death by own free will and not because they are getting paid by British. Khuda Dad volunteered to fight. But Ishar Singh told him to provide water to all soldiers, both Sikhs and Afgans when they are thirsty and it would be the greatest service on the theater of war.The attack started by the Afgans. The Afgans has one ace marksman. He targeted one Sikh who died. Gurmukh Singh was an in-experienced soldier. He was unable to fight. So Ishar Singh asked him to keep on informing the CO about the battle condition. The information received that a British division would arrive by next day. So Ishar Singh decided to prolong the battle so that Afgans couldn't advance and Gulistan and Lockhart forts would survive. He tricked the Afgans by releasing two captured Afghan soldiers. The Afghan soldiers were denoted when they reached the Afghan camp. Ishar Singh also killed the marksman by attaching his monocular into his gun and thereby exactly targeting the marksman who was hiding in between two big rocks. Few Pathans started attacking the Fort door. The Sikhs shoot protected the door, but soon ran out of bullets. They attacked the Pathans with bayonets and Indian club. The Pathans ran away from the fort door. When the Sikhs were getting into the fort Pathans started shooting them. Lal Singh alone fought with them outside the fort and asked one of the Sepoy to close the fort door. Meanwhile the Pathans managed to destroy the back wall of the fort by using explosive. The Sikhs were only 4 remaining. Ishar Singh asked Gurmukh to send message to his old superior who had humiliated him with expletives. Gurmukh Singh messaged the same expletives to the British officer.Ishar Singh removed his stripes from his uniform. He put his sword into fire. He gain remembered his wife. When the Afghans entered the fort Ishar Singh attacked them ferociously slaying hundreds of Afghans alone. When Ishar Singh was about to kill one Afghan, he found him to be a kid and stopped for second to spare him. In the same time one Afghan shot him. Ashar Singh kept on fighting. Khuda Dad was providing drinking water to the dying Afghans. The mullah killed him. The same Afghan kid also attacked Ishar Singh. The Mullah wanted to keep his feet on Ishar Singh's turban. When he was trying to do so Ishar Singh killed him. The Afgan chieftain impressed by Ishar Singh's bravery told his men not to touch turban and asked what his name is. The Afghan chief told that he would always remember him. Chanda Singh also got killed in the process of killing many enemies. The Afghans realized that their plan to take all the three forts by evening has failed. They could not advance any more. They need to go back.One Afghan chief Gul Badshah (Ashwath Bhatt) couldn't digest his defeat. He wanted Gurmukh Singh burnt inside the signaling post. Gurmukh Singh written the name of all martyred including his name in the fort wall with a coal. He shot few Afghans. The Afghans fired the post. Gurmukh Singh came out of his post with fire around his body. He shouted in the name of Gurus and caught some gunpowder and hold himself to Gul Badshah. Both of them died due to the explosion. The the shout reached near by both forts. The Sikh soldier present their also started shouting in the name of their Guru.

He privately meets up with Jan, who tells Bigger that he should turn himself in. However, Bigger refuses, aware that he will not receive a fair trial or any fair treatment by the racist police. Similarly, Bessie, who has been hiding Bigger, pleads with him to turn himself in too. Bigger convinces Bessie to run away with him instead, and takes her to an abandoned building where they spend the night.The next morning, Bessie and Bigger have an argument in which Bigger indirectly confesses to murdering Mary.

Ryan compliments Laura that she smells good and she tells him it is ""Ocean Breeze"". Ryan and Laura start to kiss.

Adam appears looking for his mixed cookie tin and opens the door where Laura waits. Laura and Tufts see each other and surprisingly know each other. Laura confirms with Tufts, who Laura know as Beth, that Ryan is ""pissy Ryan"". Ryan questions this nickname and is told it originated as a result of a couple of times Ryan had too much to drink and wet the bed. Laura says it was Beth she was out with at the club when she met Ryan. Beth determines that Ryan and Laura are on a date. Beth decides to let Ryan chose who should leave. Suddenly, Dan enters with Tali (Kae Alexander), a yoga instructor he met at the dance club. Dan knows Tufts as Ryan's ex who earned that nickname because of a pubic shaving incident. Dan does not know Laura but announces that she must be the girl Ryan is trying to have sex with. Beth is angry at Laura for meeting her ex on the night she and Laura went out together because Beth was upset after breaking up with James. Laura, realizing the complications of the situation, decides to leave, telling Ryan that she has already been through the situation where she wanted someone who wanted someone else for years.
With Laura away, Beth wants to open some champagne and make up with Ryan. She searches for the champagne flutes and tries to kiss Ryan. Ryan remembers all the laughs the he and Laura shared on their first date when he asked her questions and she gave him one word rhyming answers as a goblin. Ryan tells Beth that she never returned any of his texts and that he has moved on. Ryan asks Beth to leave. Beth reacts in disbelief but finally heads toward the door.
Outside, directionally challenged Laura is still trying to find her way out of Ryan's neighborhood. Beth struts past her and tells Ryan he made his choice and insults Laura which gets Beth a smack in the face. Laura asks Ryan for directions. Ryan apologizes for lying about Beth's identity when she came to the door. Ryan asks Laura to come inside so he can explain with his flatmates and Tali cheering him on from the doorway.
When she comes inside, Ryan attempts to explain the night. They open some champagne and drink it from coffee mugs. They start to kiss when Adam enters the room. They decide to go upstairs. Once in bed, they pick out the right condom and Ryan gets it on and Laura tastes it, determining its just yellow and not banana with a duck under the covers. Laura climbs on top and they begin to make love. Ryan lasts for about 15 seconds. They cuddle and Laura consoles Ryan with the realization that the effort was better than the first time. As time goes on, Ryan and Laura have lots of sex in many varied ways"

Far from Orario, in the ruins of an ancient city, a new threat arises. To counter this threat, the goddess Artemis has come to Orario in search of a champion-but it's not Ais Wallenstein (the legendary Sword Princess) nor Ottar (the strongest warrior to ever enter the dungeon) that she chooses.
